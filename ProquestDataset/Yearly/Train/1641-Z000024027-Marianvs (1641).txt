How Charondus , Prince of Carmania , vpon report of the exceeding beauty of Amoretta , Daughter and heire to Castalinus , King of Trebisond , became inamoured, and fell into an extreame passion, whose sicknesse the King and Queene, Father and Mother of Armatius , so much grieved to behold, that their griefes caused their, perills of life.  annuals record, Castalinus likewise swayed the Diademe in Trebisond , a Prince so highly renowned for all honourable actions, as that few such in his time lived. This Castalinus , in the blooming of his Princely yeares, desirous to leave issue to his Noble house, joyned in marriage with Eugenia , daughter and sole heire to Constantius , Emperour of Germany , by whom in short time after their Nuptials, he had issue one daughter, who was named Amoretta . This Princesse) as in comelinesse of person she exceeded, so for her beauty, wisedome and other good graces, there lived none her equall: the report of whose excellence, as Fame advanceth with her loudest trump, the honourable (especially) such peerelesse creatures, as this Princesse (yea) so highly stood she graced in the Gods favour, that none but Amorettaes beauty was remembred in most Princes Courts, both Christian and Heathen. The renowne of whose peerelesse beauty, so often blazed, came to the hearing of Armatius , Sonne and Heire apparant to the Carmanian King, who upon the surpassing praises by every one given of this Lady, begun more and more upon hearing such severall reports, to conceive an inward Ioy of her, diligently hearkening to each stranger which should recount her vertues and honour, by vertue gained. Long had not this honour followed the lovely Prince Armatius , but Love the soveraigne guide of mens thoughts, had so enthralled him, that all his delight was in contemplating of this Princesse beauty. Yea, so was he overtaken in loves snare, that nothing was pleasing vnto him, but the sweet remembrance of Amoretta : so much was his delight in her, that oftentimes in the midst of his pastimes, calling the Princesse to mind, he would as one past himselfe, altogether overcome with melancholy, abandon the company of his most familiars, seeking from their pleasing pastimes some solitary place, where hee might unheard or seene recount with large amplifications the Princesse beauty, whose servant in mind he was wholy vowed. Thus dallied Armatius so long with beauties flame, that overtake with the vehemencie thereof, he fell into an extreame Feaver, which in such strange manner assailed him, as the learned'st Physitians could not find any reason of Disease, much lesse procure his health, who languished in love, not daring to disclose his griefe to any, or acquaint his trustiest companion with his love. This sudden alteration of the Prince, in whose welfare the comfort not onely of his companions in Court, but generally of the commons consisted, moved them all to such exceeding griefe, that in short time their lovely countenances were so much altered, that neither pleasing looke, nor cheerefull word, was to be obtained from them. The King, whose aged life depended on the happinesse of his Son, as Fathers how base soever, delight in vertuous Off-springs, much more the Noble, whose honours are to be maintained by their progenie: the aged King, whose greatest felicity was in the Prince, was with such infinite griefes oppressed, that in short time his body was so weakned, that rather he desired to accompany the dead, then live in such discontent: the Mother Queene, with over much care and watching neere pined, and few which felt not some part of the Princes griefe; such was their faithfull loves unto him, whereof the Father gloried not a little, and the Mother (if women may be proud) was not a little spiced with the Disease. But neither the bountie of the Father, the extreame griefe of the Mother, the daily lamenting of the Courtiers, nor the complaints of the Commons, might any way availe the Prince, who smothering his owne sorrow, could not by all Art (Physicke allowed for mens reliefe) be any way comforted. The over-grieved burthen of whose miserie, the Queene with his Kingly Father seeking to ease, and could not as he desired accomplish, such extremity likewise assailed them, that the learnedst could not judge the difference betweene them, (so that by their ill) suppose the subjects griefe, which reverently honoured them, and could willingly have offered their owne lives for their reliefe and ease. But in vaine strive they, that seeke helpe for him whom none but the beautifull Amoretta could release, who was the Load-starre of his life: and the love of her, the speciall Physicke which must restore him, or die he would past all recovery, but by Amoretta , that Paragon of fame, Dianaes glory, Natures onely darling, and delight. Weake and feeble, past recure of Physicke, became the King and Queen, voyd of hope ever to see their Princely sonnes recovery: wherefore, forgetting all worldly pleasure and Princely delights, such as become Princes of so high esteeme, quite abolishing all the vanities of the world, they mind wholly the everlasting comfort, and joy in nothing, but his death, that from death, by his blood redeemed them. In this extremity, when all hopes were past helpe of men, behold the mercy of him that preserveth and destroyeth at his pleasure, who moved no doubt, at the intercession of some of their vertuous subjects, or taking pitty of their distresse, as wee read in holy writ, testimony of our soules comfort, how Abraham beloved of God , moved his divine Deitie, for those Cities for sinne by just Judgement consumed, if five godly people had been found within their walles, they had beene preserved: so either for the vertues of the King, or the intercession of those sorrowing subjects, the giver of all comfort sent them comfort, as you shall heare. The Carmanian King, whose prime of youth was spent in many honorable actions, holding in great regard the love of his neighbour Princes, lived in such tranquility, that he was honoured of all that heard of his government. The report of whose long sicknesse and weake estate, moved the Kings of divers Regions, by their embassage, to comfort them, and to be advertised of the truth of their estates. Amongst which, those honourable Princes that held his health in such regard, Castalinus King of Trebisond dispatched his Ambassadour. Who for the more honour of their King, was accompanied with divers Gentlemen, both of honour and great worship. These Ambassadours arriving at the Court of Carmania , their cause of comming unknowne, many matters were of the commons supposed (who will entermeddle with Princes affaires) so that amongst them divers things were imagined, and sundry dangers suspected, but no assurance of any, untill their day of hearing, which the King appointed to be as suddaine as they could require. Against which time, royall preparation was made, with all the pompe that could be devised, where for Feasting, there wanted no dainties, how rare soever, nor diversity of Vyandes to please the appetite, with many pleasing shewes, and pastimes, the better to give them occasion of well come: all which, notwithstanding the Kings weaknesse, was so exquisitly performed, that it was admirable. The day of hearing come (as time stayeth not) Charonaus having summoned his Counsell and chiefest Nobility, against that time to attend his pleasure: these severall Ambassadours were brought to his presence, where with more shew of hearty well come, then his weake body could deliver, he gave the such honorable entertainmet, as beseemed the Messengers of such Princes, and highly contented them, whose courtesie the strangers Nobles applauded, and grieved the more at his extremity, by how much the more they saw his debility. After some talke passed betweene the King and these Nobles, and that he had enquired with all kindnesse of the health of their Princes, and welfare of their Countries, and received their Letters, with divers Princely presents, they were dismissed but yet not suffred to depart, without gracious thankes to their Kings, and kind shew of good acceptance for their paines, leaving them to their repose, with great charge to his Nobles and those in authority, to see their entertainment such, as if their soveraigne Lords were present: which charge was not forgotten of those which prized their Princes honours as deare as their lives, but with such pompe and cost accomplished each severall command of his Highnesse: as the strangers might well admire to behold it. Their Dyets so divers and so abundant, as they had never seene the like, furnished with so much sundry musicke, and for cunningly vsed, as might well delight the Gods. To acquaint you with other pastimes for recreation, as Playes, Maskes, Tilting, Turneying, Barriors, and other Courtly Pastimes, besides their hunting of Tygers, wilde Bores, and Lyons, which moved such delight as other sports pleasing unto them. Thus in using daily those pleasures, when the Nobles had spent some time in the Court, every one content with his royall entertainment hearing amongst the Nobles of the Country such generall honor of the Prince Armatius , whom they had not yet seene, an especiall desire moved them to visit the Prince, bewayling greatly, that such adverse chances, should nip so brave and honourable a Prince, in the blooming time of his princely yeares. The Prince Armatius , albeit the imbecility of his body denied those Nobles his presence at their pastimes, in which severall sport he much delighted, yet that they might not depart of him unseene he commanded a sumptuous Banquet in his Lodging to be ordained: to which hee invited the stranger Nobles and their Companies: who wishing to see the Prince were as glad to accompany him, as he desirous of their company, and graciously with many humble thankes, accepted the Princes good will. The youthfull Nobles attendant on the Prince, carefull to see each thing ordered, for the honor of his Majesty, wanted nothing that might be desired, onely expected the comming of their Guests, who not unmindfull of their promise, as dinner time drew nigh, prepared themselves towards the Prince, unto whom by his Nobility in most gorgious manner they were conducted: no sooner entred they his presence, but Armatius , whose courtesie was such as gained the love of his subjects, and all strangers that had seene his demeanor, yet at this time had better knowledge how to entertaine them, then ability to performe what he would, stretching himselfe in his bed, as his weake limbes would suffer him, he gave them such hearty welcomes, as highly contented them, and beseemed their estates. These Nobles when they had made their Eyes witnesses, of what report had so often bruted, rather accused report of great wrong, in not giving him such due as he deserved, then of over much praise: for that the fame bruted of him, was not to bee valued with his worthinesse. The time of Dinner passed they, with many glaunces on the Prince, noting his courtesie, but ever lamenting his griefe, and wishing his health, framing themselves, to pleasant Discourses, to put him from those melancholy thoughts, wherewith he was overmuch burthened. Thus with much diversity of Table-talke, consumed the time, the graver sort, of matters for benefit of the State, the greener heads, whose years required no other cares of their pleasing pastimes and pleasure, the managing their horses, commending the statelinesse of their bodies, their finenesse in careering their bravery in their Cornet, and excellent swiftnesse in their gallop, their readinesse in hand, and their courage in the face of the Enemy: not omitting the gallant cries of their Hounds, nor forgetting, by which and which, such a Bucke was slaine, and such a Stagge pul'd downe, passing not, without high commending the soring of their hawks, nor forgetting their statelinesse in flight, with their fierce seazing on their Game. And then for variety, as occasion is ministred, Carowse a health to their Mistresse and Loves, in their Country. The Prince as lovely as the best, and in his health as well able to performe whatsoever, had his greatest comfort in listening to the talke of Diphilus and Ephestris , two noble men of Trebisond , which accompanied of pleasure Fabritius , the chiefe in Commission for their King Armatius , earnestly noting these two Nobles of Trebisond as most delighted with their persons and pleasant parly, heard Diphilus carowse a health to the Princesse Amoretta : whose name the distressed Prince no sooner heard uttered, but the remembrance of that sweet object, his lives sole health, and Mistresse of his fancies, so revived his dying spirits, that suddenly the beholders might well perceive his wan colour, which urged a troubled spirit to vanish, and those Vermillion dyed Roses, the wonted Badges and Ornaments of his sweet Face, challenge their former intrest, and for a time possesse them, restoring unto Nature her due, making his lovely countenance as cheerfull to the beholders, as the glorious Sunne to the captived, whose liberty being deprived, have long been debarred of all wordly delights, and seldome received comfort from that heavenly essence. This cheerfull alteration in the Prince was noted of divers, whose eares, albeit busied in listening to the discourses of these strangers; yet the eyes of his owne attendants, with dutifull care gave heed vnto the Prince. Amongst whose government the care of the Princes health was committed, Machaon , a man for his art famous  & learned in his profession (which was Physick) who sometime was tutor vnto him, noting this sudden chage in the Prince, supposing verily by his countenance, that some of their speeches did moove him to content, comming suddenly to him, and grasping his arme felt his pulses beat so fiercely as in long time they had not done the like; which made him more considerately search, to finde the cause of this motion, enquire it hee durst not, doubting to move him to melancholy, having so often beene denyed, but resting by him a while continuing with his arme grasped, he felt the Pulse more and more to worke, which gave him the more cause to find, if he might, the originall from whence it came, and noting diligently unto which of the company hee most inclined his Eyes, hee might perceive Diphilus and his Ephestris earnestly busied in their former talke, which was, I dare say, neither of Religion, nor of Government of the State, yet was it such as Machaon perceived highly contented the Prince, and desired it might long continue, so it were for his Lords good. Many pretty questions passed betweene them, and much variety, in whose prattle many a faire Lady was commended by one, and for Argument as highly of the other discommended, in which humour were divers of the Nobilitie of the Country, and Ladies of worth by name questioned of, and many a youthfull pranke by themselves committed, yet all in friendship, and kindly taken, though harsh frumps passed sometimes between them, which moved them to much mirth. But when in earnest Ephestris forgetting himselfe, falling from one matter to another, & that there should be a judgmet given, who for beauty was the onely Paragon, Ephestris for affection commended Medullina , Daughter and sole Heire of Himettus , King of Epire , in whose Fathers Court, hee had long beene trained vp, giving the price from their owne Countrie Ladies. Whereat Diphilus , as if he had been the sworne Champion of their Land, moved at his rash censure, forgetting the reverence of this place, told him flatly his judgement was false, and that he would avow: offering his glove in combate, to maintaine that the Princesse Amoretta , and none but she, deserved the name of beautifull: whose wisedome, and other good graces, in any one, was not to be found in the circuit of the earth: and therefore Ephestris (quoth he) thou hast done overmuch wrong, to derogate the honour due to Thracian Dames, especially our Peerlesse Amoretta , whose Face if beautious Helena lived, for whom so many thousands lost their lives, she might well resigne that Title of the onely faire, to her, and none but she; whose like liveth not. Ephestris who was wife and well demeaned, perceiving this parly begun in jest, likely to end in quarrell, noting likewise, how the rest of the company ceased their serious talke, to attend them, with a smiling countenance, as one not possest with choler, brake off his talke thus. Why (my Lord) shall matter of so small moment cause friends to jarre? What is beauty, whereof wee have so long disputed, and so highly of us regarded? Nothing but a fading pleasure, an ornament of the face which maketh the heart proud, and draweth the mind from every good motion to many odious offences, whereby the honourable in committing dishonourable actions, are so blemished, that they become a common by-word to the veriest drudge that Nature hath framed, Helena was faire, and accounted the onely of her time, yet who so much scorned? Cressida beautifull, yet who more false? If beauty be attended on with such shame as these two famous women gained, why should we care who is beautifull? My sweet Diphilus mistake me not, if I have passed my judgement rashly, for neither care I whose fame in that case is esteemed or defamed, but passe them by as things of no regard; onely for argument I have spoken more then either I regard or account of: therefore let not this be any breach of our friendship, for I protest, if thou shouldst say, the white Swan were as blacke as the Raven, the Ocean dry, and Ships floating on the maine; J would affirme it, rather then our friendship should be for such a matter discontinued. Well Ephestris (quoth Diphilus ) I finde your kindnesse great, and will thanke you for it, but trust me, this gloze may not serve your turne, for as you have spoken heresie against Beauty and maintained a stranger before your home-borne Ladies, you shall either recant your judgement, before our soveraigne Princesse Amoretta , or receive such penance by your quest assigned, which I promise thee shall be all honorable Ladies. O my Lord (answered Ephestris ) I hope I shall find your Honour more kind, then for so small an offence to deliver your Friend Prisoner at the Bar, where the parties shall be Judges, and my Jury such, as all Lawes allow me to appeale from, if you should; and my fault such, as if my life were in their tryall depending, I might well make my Testament, and dispose of what I possesse, heartily desiring God to receive my Soule; for sure I am, my body should not long enjoy Breath: for no greater Corrasive can be offered this Sex, then to attribute the honour of such a prize to any one particular, they all standing on tearmes of Beauty,: the Crow which thinkes her owne Birds the fairest: so Women how ill-faced and wrinkled soever they be, may not endure to heare any commended, if happily they should heare it spoken by such as they dare not in Speech displease, yet will their countenance shew their Hearts discontent, by scrowling of the Browes, hanging the Lip, or setting a sweet Face, as sugred as the Gall, or by some such outward action or other, shall you find where that nipt her, for which offence looked she never so highly, with Bell, Booke and Candle, you shall be cursed, and never more come in her Pater noster , how deepe soever you have beene in her Creed . Hold, hold, Ephestris (quoth Diphilus ) too much of one thing is good for nothing. Thou hast plai'd the excellent Orator. Who had thought your Lordships experience had beene such, for thereon J know you ground all your authority: Author I am sure in Schooles you never read any, which have so highly abused that sacred Sex, sacred I may well call them, my Ephestris , who are not honoured of Mortall Creatures, but of the Gods, and therefore in the higher account, and the more in regard, the greater thy offence, and the more grievous thy punishment. To this pleasant Discourse the whole Assembly gave eare, and were greatly delighted therewith, yet to put them from it, and to end as pleasantly, Fabritius said: My Lord Diphilus ; what, is your honour become Beauties Champion: Farre was it from my thought, that ever you would with such earnestnesse have defended our faire Ladies, but since I see you are so great an Advocate, I will cause you to have thankes for it at our returne, other reward I dare promise none. And you my Lord Ephestris , that so clarkely have depraved them, would I might be your Scholler, whose experience is so great, Tully, Ovid , or Marcus Aurelius , that wrote most in their disgrace, never writ so largely. I must needs say, as my Lord Diphilus , our Ladies are little beholding vnto you, for the danger, committed in the same, the least is heresie, and how heresie is to be punished your honor knoweth: yet my Lord, as I would gladly become a peacemaker, and that friends may not grow at ods, whereby any danger might happen to your person, albeit the offence be not pardonable, yet the fault made in a forraigne country ought there to have this tryall. If it shall stand with your good liking, no Ladies present to heare your hard censure, your favour may be the more: and since I have by patience of this honourable company, intruded my selfe to speake in our Ladies cause, not being a feed Counceller for them, I will intreat these noble Gentlemen to give me leave, and let me censure of the same, so it stands with your Lordships good pleasure. Now truely, quoth Ephestris , I find your Lordship is kind, and more kind then I can desire or deserve, when I shall need your favour in matter of more import, I will make bold: till when, I put you down with Diphilus for one of my small friends, for this matter I shall need small friendship, vnlesse to bring your cause to better effect, you doe as many crafty people now a dayes vse, to make small conscience, in selling mens Soules to the Divell for money, to sweare what he shall command them, how false soever, to the impoverishing of many, whose good hospitality,  & other good neighborhood was more then ever such base villains could reach unto, if such a Copanio you met mewth, or serch out some subtill Lawyer that can by his quirkes and quiddities in Law, make a bad matter good, and annointing the Iudge with Vnguentum aureum , cause him to incline to the same, my Cake is dough, if by such Subornations, or Swearing, and false Iudgement, my Speech be wrested to your advantage. Cease my Ephestris , this dread, Heavens forfend, for this offence thy punishment should be as thou deservest, much lesse that any sinister meanes should be used to bring thee to open Pennance: yet good Ephestris , let me intreat thee, as in this Assembly thou hast unjustly given the prize of Beauty to Medullina , and therein thou hast wronged highly the onely of the World, by thy partiall Judgement, in derogating from her the Title of most excellent, which is most Honourable, and no more than her worth requireth; confesse but thy fault and errour in the same, and an end if thou lovest thy owne good, refuse not this offer, least worse befall thee then Acteon , or to Paris for his rash judgement. Thou hast learned us in thine own Exordium , that women are inspired with minds of revenge. Be therefore by thy friends entreated, before the punishmet come vpon thee, so maist thou keepe thee from much sorrow, for if no greater mischiefe fall vpon thee thou shalt be sure of more curses, then thy weake carkase can beare: for my Ephestris , in friendship I say this, and warne thee as one that loveth thee, knowing their inclinations, which as thy selfe confesseth is bent to revenge: if so, as many as shal heare of this blasphemy, if they do thee no other ill, their cursing thou shalt be sure of, and womens curses, are as bad as the curse of holy St. Giilian , which is said to be ten times worse then the Divels. Treason, treason, my Lords, quoth Ephestris , if I have spoken heresie, this questionlesse is no better then treason, and the comparison so odious as may not be endured, the Divell and a woman joyned in one) as fit a match as may be made. Well my Lord, since in my error I have found you kind in favouring my fault, let vs doe as all bribing Officers vse, beare with me, and I'le hold with thee: so by concealing my fault, the lesse dangers shall happen vnto you, if you refuse my kind offer, I come vpon you with an old Proverbe (ka mee) ka thee) or as children play, (tell of me, Ile tell of thee.) Well watcht my Lord Ephestris , quoth the whole company, but my Lords, let the further hearing of this matter rest, till better opportunity, least your tediousnesse, breed trouble to my Lord the Prince, whose quiet, I would not willingly offend. My honourable Lords, answered the Prince, if these discourses of those Noble men be pleasing to your honors, I assure you, they are no way offensive vnto me, I have troubled you from your better cheere, to accept of a sicke mans pittance, wherevnto you are also heartily welcome, as to your owne Pallaces, (and welcome) saith our Countrey housholders, is the best dish, at their feasts: if therefore my Lords you accept my welcome, I am the more honoured by you, which have so graciously vouchsafed mee your companies. Then turning to the Lord Diphilus he said, for you my good Lord, how much I acknowledge my selfe indebted to you, I omit, and yeeld you as many thousand thankes for your pleasing speech, as there were sillables in your words: you have like your selfe defended the weaker sexe, for the which were I the Princesse Amoretta , your challenge made in my cause, should be bountifully rewarded: I am sorry my good Lord, my bad hap was such, that I knew you no sooner. But if it shall stand with your Lordships pleasure, that during the time of your abode here, to vouchsafe me your company, so it may be no disparagement to your serious affairs: perswade your self, your welcome shall be no better in any place then vnto me, for which kindnesse, you should binde me vnto your friendship. Gracious Prince, answered the Noble Diphilus , thankes for your Princely favour, and gracing me thus, which am not any way to doe your Majesty service, but wherein your Highnesse shall command, I shall be ready with all dutifulnesse to accomplish. Leave these speeches good my Lord, quoth the Prince, and offering duty where friendship is requested, and granting my sute, let me enjoy thy company, so shalt thou command Armatius for ever as a friend. The graver sort of those Noble strangers, whom matters of more importance called away, after humble thankes given for their royall entertainment, wishing health and all happinesse vnto his Excellence, they commit him to his rest. Machaon which had endured the end of all these prattles, and perceiving that this talke was altogether frivolous and not worthy the hearing, mooved him to delight: he began diligently to enter each particular discourse of Diphilus and Ephestris , and considerately to note each severall passion of the Prince: so farre searched this skilfull Physitian into every particular, that canvasing it throughly, he noted his speciall jesture, and how his colour came (and vanished) yea how much his heart was possessed with joy, when he heard the Princesse Amoretta named: the working of his pulses, made Machaon , imagine the cause of his disease, yet had no assurance thereof, and so enquire it of the Prince was in vaine, for that he had so often denyed the same: wherefore he concealing his thoughts, in hope to worke meanes for his recoverie, and finding those cinders which were like to consume him, (and the rather) if he could procure Diphilus to accompany him. Thus leaving the Prince to his quiet, and Machaon to his care, for recovering his health, returne we to the aged weake King. The King whose long sicknesse, and care of his wife and sonnes health, whom he loved most zealously, being extreamely vexed, and greatly weakened of his body, when Physick had done what was possible, and small hope to recover him, in the midst of his passions when all hopes was past, but onely the comfort of him who by his word rayseth the dead from the grave, so this ( Charondas ) received comfort by his Kingly neighbours friends, whose letters when he had by Councell perused, and with regard and advise, noted each kind offer, with their perswading reasons, (albeit) he could hardly disgest the same: yet considering how fraile men are, and that our cares of Terraine joyes, are to be fastened to that Celestiall commander, which releeveth all those that seeke him, he received himselfe, and like a faithfull Souldier, taking hold of the promise in holy writ so often repeated, he cast care of wife, child and Kingdome, upon him, that first gave it him, and by whose providence he so long enjoyed them: taking his chiefest care to gratifie those his friends by whose counsell he was vrged to the heavenly comfort. And those honourable Nobles for their paines, who wishing to be with their friends in their owne Countries, attend his Highnesse pleasure, for answer: which he took order should with such speed be dispatched, as possible might any way be vsed. Armatius , whose heart was on his blasphemy, vowing his love wholly to the Princesse Amoretta , was so delighted in recounting her praise, as nothing could be so pleasing, but as all sorts of men infected with that agony (if their love be faithfull) are enclined to some jealousie, so this monstrous Basiliske, whose poyson infecteth the veines, and consumeth the heart, without wisedome governe the minde, as by this Prince notably appeared: who in his idle thoughts, calling to mind the praises of Diphilus , and the challenge made in the defence of the Princesse Amoretta , as love endureth no arrivall, so Armatius striken with the sting of jealousie, began to conceive many vnhonourable thoughts of Diphilus , supposing Amoretta was his Love, and that by Diphilus his joyes in her love, and hope of favour, should be frustrate and of no account: with much matter more, then ever was by Diphilus imagined, how largely soever his speech was vsed in the Princesse behalfe, to procure their delights, and moove Ephestris to choller: notwithstanding no reason might perswade, where jealousie had given judgement, for the Prince in this jealousie, sought no meane, but revenge of him that never committed the least thought of evill against him. When revenge in this Princes heart was thus imprinted, and rage and jealousie set downe his death, an honourable motion, more befitting his Grace then rigour, mooved by the inspiration of the eternall God, withdrew him from this base attempt, he called to minde, the honour of his house, the love of those Princes, their bordering neighbours, by whose command, Diphilus came into this Country, the scandall so bloody a fact deserved, and what continuall ignomy would redownd vnto him and his progeny for ever: accusing himselfe of great impiety, he exclaimed on his follies in this manner. Blush Armatius , at thy base thoughts, and so much sorrow for thy pretended mischiefe, against this noble stranger, as if thou hadst shed the blood of a thousand innocents: hast thou from thy Cradle disdained to offer wrong to the most inferiour, and wilt now begin with murther of a Noble man? Knowest thou not, that to adde to his head one haire, is more then the greatest Prince can doe? And wilt thou seek his life that never had thought of ill against thee? Hath thy Father lived so many yeares honorably reputed amongst them, ever in tranquility, and by thy cruell slaughtering thy friend, shall their peace be broken, was it not for his comfort and thy good, these strangers came into this country? and for their kindnesse, canst thou reward them with such despight? Thou enviest the happinesse of a toward gentleman, for thou knowest not what, (say he loved the Princesse) what is that to thee, intrest hast thou none, to debarre him from it. Amoretta thou knowest not but by heare-say, he a Noble man of her country, a toward Gentleman, and worthily may obtaine her, Nature hath made him of the mould of the earth, whereof thou art framed, the Begger is as subject to amorous passions as the Prince. Amoretta is beautifull, wise, faire, and in ye principall time of her flourishing estate, lovely as the dewe on the sweet Roses. Diphilus valiant, well featured; wise and toward, in all honorable actios; all which are load-starres to draw Ladies to love, and Amoretta is but a woman though a Princesse. If then thou hast neither feare of God, or law of humanity to perswade thee from so great a mischiefe, yet let his kindnesse offered thee, which hath been as much as ever thou requirest, be of some regard. The fiercest beasts seldome harme those, whose society they vse, and wilt thou be found more cruell then vnreasonable creatures: No, no, Armatius , let dye thy malice to Diphilus , who is innocent, and farre from any thought of pretended evill against thee, for so much the more shall his blood with extremity be revenged, by how much the more, thou vnjustly injuriest him, yea rather chuse to dye a thousand deaths, if every life were a Legion of lives, then hold so base a mind. Thou hast long (though to thy great griefe) and much sorrow concealed thy love to Amoretta , and now wilt thou murther him that wisheth thee well: for her love. No, no, Armatius , let honor be the marke whereat thou aymest, account death more precious then life with ignominy, honor by murther blemished, is such a staine as can never be-raced out, but the continuall ignominy thereof, will remaine while there is any being: Yea, and what is more to be regarded, ye welfare of thy Subjects on whom the blood of so noble a man will be with great effusion revenged, and thy country like those ruinous monuments of Troy layd wast and desolate, which was spoyled for a fact nothing so odious. Sithence thou hast all these reasons to reduce thee from this vile thought, dally no loger with thy shadow, as in ye tale of Æ sope thou maist read, of the dog; who moved with envy, of anothers welfare, not onely hazarded his life, but what else he had in possession. Though the comparison be ridiculous, yet the example may move thee to feare thine owne fall. For if the Gods be so just in punishing such offences in vnreasonable creatures, how much more shalt thou be plagued, whom God hath not onely endued with reason, but invested with titles of Majesty and honor; whose life should shine on the earth, as the glorious Sun, and by thy vertues drawe such as live vnder thy government, from their desire to commit evill; for such as is the Pastour, such will be the flocke: if the Prince be vertuous, the Subject will feare to offend, if he be vicious, who will care to live in obedience of him, or his lawes. Thou seest Armatius , the perill surcease therefore thy base thoughts (and as Diphilus is Noble) where thou hast without desert beene jealous, become jealous from envying him, that no way wished thee evill; admit him to thy friendship, to him thy kindnesse may be acceptable, and in vsing such favours, maist thou in time learne the truth of what thou now supposest. If Diphilus love Amoretta he cannot be so secret, but in some sort or other, thou shalt attaine to the knowledge thereof: and as thou shalt in conversing with him, finde his Honourable dealings, so maist thou either trust him or refuse him: If Amoretta have vowed her love vnto him, seeke to master thy affection, and wish them joy, if not, his friendship may the sooner bring thee to thy desires, by acquainting ye Princesse with thy love, in explaining the passions for her thou hast endured. Amoretta (saith the worlds report) is beautifull, wise, and honorably demeaned, and therefore cannot be cruell: her father a King beloved of all that have heard of him, whose kindnesse hath been such to thy Father and thee, as thou canst not deserve; if such love remaine in the parents, the children should not hate: then fondling, if thou hast wronged thy self in concealing thy griefe, accuse thy owne follies; and condemne not thy friends of evill, nor let thy jealousie blame Diphilus who never had thought of preteded evill against thee; if thou faile in thy love, blame none but thy selfe, spare to speake, spare to speed. Cowards never were Loves Champions; nor fainthearted swads obtained Ladies love, women though never so base, will be sued, sought after, and courted with many devises allured to win them, and their loves obtained, as sundry meanes sought to continue it. A Novice art thou Armatius ,  & never came to know what many a hardy man at armes hath endured, Histories are divers, which shew the extreames of Princes and famous Conquerours, that they endured through love, yet hast thou never read of any that ever wooed by silence, courted their Mistresses with imaginations, or obtained their love being mute: Longer maist thou smother thy griefe; wch may cureles consume thee: fire suppressed burneth wth more vehemency; & love concealed cosumeth the intrals & slayeth remedilesse How long may thy shoo wring thy foot, before any that looke thee in the face can tell where it pincheth thee. Many of meane birth have obtained the love of Princes and Ladies of great worth, and by daring to attempt, wedded and bedded them. If the ignoble have had such successe in love. Rouze thee dastard from this loathsome cabinet, arme thee with hopes of thy Mistresse favour, and with courage seeke to obtaine it: let griefe no longer oppresse thee, but like the Son of thy renowned father, shew thy selfe; let not daring love, which by many good motions may be vanquished, overthrow thee by subjecting thy selfe overmuch vnto it, but in the face of the enemy shew thy selfe; and there by prowesse purchase such renowne, as the report of thy valor, may gaine thee the love of her thou most desirest. Womens loves for the most part are setled on the valiant and such as adventure, holding in regard such as by their valor, can & will maintaine their honours, bearing in tryumph their favours in the field; and gaining honour in their titles. I, thus Armatius should be thy thoughts, hold thee there, and no doubt of good successe: Amoretta is but a woman though a Princesse, thou sonne to a King, and no way her inferiour. Then continue this resolution and Amoretta may in time, as well seeke thy favour, as the noble Amazonian Alexanders love.  How Diphilus one of the Nobles of Trebisond , coming to take his leave of the Prince Armatius , playing a game at Chesse, unto whom Diphilus giving the Matte, the Prince Armatius on the suddaine stracke him with the Chesse-bord, and what then followed.  unto him by one of his Pages, that the Lord Diphilus was come to visite him, which did put him from all further imaginations at that time. Diphilus no sooner came to his presence, but Armatius with a blushing countenance bad him welcome, ashamed of his rash suspition; yet concealing the same as he might, framed such kind speech as he best could, the better to assure his welcome, not sparing oftentimes to render great and hearty thankes for his kindnesse in comming to visit him; and more, to shew how glad he was of his company, hee called to rise, which he had not done long before, but for necessity of making his bed. Thus when long time was spent betweene them, discoursing of many matters, to both their contents, Armatius called for meate; where to accompany Diphilus , he received more sustenance than he had in many dayes before, to the great joy of his attendant Machaon , who by messengers certified the King and Queen thereof, who joyed and were not a little comforted at this report. Dinner ended, and Diphilus with the Prince devising to beguile the time, loth sodenly to leave him, called for a Chesse bord, wherewith they sported a while, Armatius whom griefe of minde procured soone to melancholy, loosing two or three faire games, became very impatient, to aggravate whose choller and make his fury the more, Diphilus playing for cuning to make game, tooke his Queen, and gave checke to his King, whereat the Prince forgetting both himselfe and other those motions so lately by him minded, first violently striking him with the boord, ranne fiercely on him, and taking him by the throat, cryed mainly out thus; Villaine quoth hee, shamest thou not to rob me of my Lady, my Love, my life and soules comfort, but to my teeth must cheeke me therewith in mine owne Countrey. (Base fugitive) thou shalt beard me no more therewith, for by thy miserable death, will I recover to mine owne possession, my Love, my Lady, my Queene, yea in despight of thy head, Amoretta shal be my mistresse, sweet Princesse, the only soveraign of my thoughts. Machaon and his noble attendants, seeing this friendship lately profest so suddenly forgotten, taking him with much adoe from Diphilus , were not a little perplexed, but as men past themselves, having never seen the like, could imagine no cause, greatly doubting that suddenly he was growne lunaticke. Diphilus vexed at this hard usage of the Prince, was no sooner freed from him, but in great choller would have departed; Protesting to be revenged for this discurtesie offered him. Affirming, that his entising speeches in colour of kindnesse, was to no end but to draw him from his honourable friends to murther him. Machaon carefull what might ensue hereof, weighing each occasion which might hereat be taken, besought Diphilus of that love hee bare the King his master, which had used them honourably, of his love to his owne King, and all that might be imagined to conceive of this wrong offerd as of no such pretended matter, as he supposed: but rather with patience to consider the long extreame sicknesse of the Prince,  & how subject by reason of his infirmity hee was unto melancholy, undertaking on his faith and honest reputation, how ever the occasion grew, it was not in malice: assuring him, the Prince when he should call to minde this unkind action, would with griefe lament it, and sorrowing for the same, submit himselfe, craving hearty forgivenesse for his rashnesse. Machaon vexed at the heart for these unkind dealings of the Prince, intreating his associates to perswade Diphilus , when himselfe to the Prince, and after dutifull speech to his Grace, recounted unto him, in what evill part Diphilus tooke this abuse by him offered; humbly beseeching him, as hee esteemed the love of his Princely Father, and the honour and reputation of his Country, to acknowledge in some curteous manner the wrong committed and so reconcile himselfe. Armatius who passion had not yet left him, albeit in his health none might more perswade him then Machaon , yet hearing him preach repentance, being in this humour, forgot their passed friendship, and moved with his talke, albeit it was used for his good; with a looke as gastly as a Ghost risen from the grave, drew neare Machaon , and laying hands on him, had like to have spoyled him had he not made the more speed away. Diphilus understanding what had bin offered the aged man, and hearing in what regard the Prince held his love, passing by his choller, began with great heavinesse to lament the Prince his agonie, and sorrowing for him besought the heavens Creator so to comfort the Prince as himselfe would wish in the like extreame. And thus leaving Machaon and the Nobles to their charge, departed. The Nobles whose griefe was not little, having hearts over-charged with sorrow, thinking it not convenient to leave him alone, doubting some worse matter should happen unto him, went to visite the Prince cheerefully, enquiring of his welfare, which with so good countenances as he could use was kindly answered of the Prince; who having past the extremity of his fury, calling to minde those notable abuses offered his Friends, greatly lamenting his folly therein, he said.  How the Prince Armatius calling to minde the wrong offered the Lord Diphilus , sorrowed for it, accusing himselfe of great ingratitude for the same, in dishonouring his State and Country. The Nobles are intreated honourably, and with rich gifts depart, Armatius recovereth in short time some strength, and doth abandon his sicke lodging.  from the worlds reproach, who voyd of all reason, more brutish then the savage beast, have sought to murther my dearest friends. Oh, how might I blush with shame, and ashamed of my evill committed, never behold the faces of those whom I have so evill entreated: what fury bewitched me to this mischiefe? Or what divelish sorcery enchaunted my spirits, and captivated my sences, so to offend thee Lord Diphilus ? Who of thy zealous affection and curtesie came to visite mee, delighting so greatly in thy company as I did. And thou the Father of gravity, my greatest hope in the world, Machaon thou whose honest care and love to me hath beene ever showne from my Cradle. Oh Machaon , how ungratefull have I beene, rewarding thy good with the hazard of thy blood. Woe is me unhappie, and thrice unhappie, that I have lived to behold the light of this day, wherein past my selfe, I have so highly offended. Pardon, pardon my Lord Diphilus as thou art honourable, and thou Machaon , whose aged yeares I have so highly offended: Forgive my amisse and remit that evill I have committed against thee, or let me never behold the dayes light againe. Why should I live, whom mine owne conscience so highly accuseth of such impiety? Will not the Fowles of the ayre soaring over thy head as thou walkest, cry out (ungratefull Armatius ) that wouldst have murthered thy friends: Each creature that God hath made, will exclaime against thee for this evill, following thee with cryes of horrour to thy everlasting reproach. Therefore unhappie Armatius , since by thy owne doings this reproach is happened upon thee, whereby for ever thou art dishonoured and no man hereafter will dare to use any familiarity with thee, no not one, from the Prince to the Begger, (live not, live not thou Armatius ) but let that hand that committed the evill, finish thy life, which living, can never be unremembred. In this fury resolving to have mischiefe feed himselfe, his Nobles taking him in their armes, with such comfortable speeches as they could, pacified him, who seeing his sorrowfulnesse, were partakers of his griefe, and much lamented his extremity, as men might for their Soveraigne. Yet casting off care, and seeking the best for their quiet they could, they laid him in his Bed, where with solemn musick they procured him to sleepe. Where for a time I leave him. Time that findeth all things, hath now wrought an end of the Kings affaires, for the dispatch of the Embassadors, whom the King hath great entertainment and Iewels of high estate, so rewarded, as they all had cause to speak of his royall bounty. The Embassadours receiving their Letters, and the time appointed for their departure, their ships with victuals at the Kings cost replenished, and all other necessaries, Diphilus who had beene often solicited by Machaon , to visit the Prince, and by his report, whose word was of account with all that had knowledge of his simple dealings, was perswaded of the Princesse sorrow, for the wrong offered him. Wherefore that it might appeare unto Armatius , hee departed not in displeasure, but that he had forgotten all wrongs offered, kindly before his departure, came to take his leave. Where upon the courteous demeanour of the Prince, who manifested his griefe by the aboundance of sighes, which hee powred forth, they were reconciled, and an inviolable league of friedship vowed betweene them: which with solemne Oathes they protested, should never quaile in either of them. The haste of the noble Embassadors who desired to be with their Loves at home, is more now then Diphilus wished: But what must be, shall be, how loth soever. Wherefore after many friendly gratulations betweene them and great gifts of the Prince, on his new ( Amico ) bestowed, they take leave each of other, Diphilus solemnly praying for the Princesse health, and Armatius wishing him all happinesse. Thus al things fitted by the Kings command, they were honourably conducted unto the Port, where their Ships ready furnished, attended their comming: when they had not long stayed, but a faire winde to serve their turnes, God sent them and they embarqued themselves, each one for his severall Country, and the Nobles returned to ye Court; where to their carefull regard of their King, Countries benefit, we leave them, to let you know further of the Prince, who is troubled as you shall heare. The Prince, whom Nature had formed so exquisit in lineaments of body, as could be required, having Wisedome and valour inferiour to none, when hee had considered with great Wisedome, from point to point, the extremity of his estate, and found that his Disease was grievous, and so great, that he rather desired death then life, in that agonie to be continued; weying all dangers which might befall him, in seeking secretly for such helpe, as by his owne industry he could procure: with the pleasures and hearts content, the obtaining of his Loves delight, would bring him; resolutely determined, as much as he might, to cherish himselfe: and disguising himselfe in habit of a Traveller, unknowne of any man, so soone as his strength would permit him, he departed his Countrey towards Trebisond , and either gaine his Lady, or try in short time the fickelenesse of his Fortune: hazarding all on this rest, he secretly procureth all his Iewels, and such Summes of money as he could: and by little and little recovering himselfe, used his wonted familiarity amongst the Nobles,  & Courtiers; which did cause no small content and hearts joy in the King, Queene, and Commons; yea, such was the generall rejoycing of the whole people in the Realme, for his recovery, that there was not one, which shewed not some sign of gladnesse, by his outward appearance.  How Armatius recovering health, sought opportunity to leave the Court, his Kingly Father and Mother, to see the Carmanian Court which suddenly he obtained, and what happened him in his Iourney.  Clouds, so lasted this joy amongst these loving Subjects not long: for Armatius continuing his determination, conveyed his summes of money and Jewels into a Grove within the Parke neare the Court, at such severall times (onely to effect his pretended purpose) as he would choose to be solitary, wrought so close, and with such discretion that he was altogether unperceived of any man. Each thing wrought to his content, secretly in the evening, his companions by him appointed to keepe the Courtiers from idlenesse, by such pastimes as he had devised, as Masking, Barriers, Dicing, and other recreations, whom he refused to accompany, alleaging that he might not be long absent from the King, and that his sport determined, was to recreate the Queene, who since her sicknesse was very melancholy, which coyned excuse passed for currant, as what was it they would not credit which he should report. Having thus politikely fitted all things, Supper ended, and every one attending the beginning of the sports and pastimes, Armatius who had more strings to his Harpe then one, had no care but how to convey himselfe from their presence, which he tooke opportunity to do, telling the Queen Mother he had given his word to be one of the Maskers, which she being glad of, as rejoycing to remove his melancholy, by any meanes, suffered him to depart. But too soone alas, gave she credit to his friends Speeches, which turned them all to great sorrow and heavinesse: for Armatius minding left what they supposed he most joyed in, conveyed himselfe with all the hast he possibly could into the Parke, where his Footeman attended his comming with his Horse, on which he was no sooner mounted, to drive in suspition or jealous thoughts of his late travaile from his man, he commanded him presently, to speed him with all the haste he might, unto the House of a Knight dwelling not farre off, with a devised message, pretending the businesse to be of great waight and importance, and straightly charging him not to depart from thence before his comming, which should be the next Night. With this commandement the Servant departed, least suspecting the losse of so bountifull a Master was so neare. But the Prince whose chiefest content was in beholding the Idea of that Paragon whom Fame had so extolled, had his heart fired with desire, that he thought every day a yeare, and every minute a moneth, untill he beheld the excellencie of Natures worke, the onely performed worke of Beauty, and the Soveraigne Goddesse of his thoughts: of which Armatius having no small regard, doubting to be missed of the King, and loth to lose that opportunity, posteth with all speed unto the Grove where his Coyne and Jewels lay, where the better to escape the suspition of Officers in his passage, crossing the Seas, he attired himselfe in the habit of a Marchant, which he had ready provided for that purpose: and so making small stay he ceaseth not his couriers pace, nor spareth any Horse flesh, untill he came to the Port where he intended to imbarke himselfe. No sooner arrived he at that so long desired place, but Fortune who had bent his thoughts to travaile, entending after her many crosses to sauce his Sowre with some Sweets, and like a comfortable Physitian, after many bitter Pilles ministred for cloying the stomacke of his Patient, comforteth him with some conserve, or other more pleasing his appetite, so the Prince now in the beginning of his Fortunes, found this favour, to arme him with the better hope of ensuing good: for at his first comming to the City, after inquiry made for some ship bound for Carmania , hee had intelligence of a Barke already haled out of the Harborough into the Roade, her yards crossed, and her Marriners expecting the comming aboord of the Master and her Marchants, and so to depart. Which newes how pleasing it was to the Prince suppose you Gentils, that have your hearts so full fraught with desire as this. Noble Armatius , who no sooner was informed hereof, but diligently went himselfe to search the Master and Marchants of this ship, whom he found in an Ostria , carowsing healths to their good voyage, and taking leave of their friends in the City: to whose company the Prince being come, albeit nothing acquainted with the conditions of those people, yet he so framed his behaviour to his habit, that it might have beene admired amongst the Courtiers, his quaint behaviour, had they beene beholders thereof; pleasing so well these humorous companions with his carowsing, courtesie, and bountifull expences, that nothing he could require was denied him. A wonder it were to tell you, when he required passage, with what willingnesse they granted it, and what large proffers were made him of their Cabbins, and other Sea courtesies: all which he accepted with such kindnesse, and none more welcome than Armatius ; who standing on Thornes to be cleare of his Land, whom Love enforceth without regard of Father, Crowne, or Subjects, to leave, he hasteneth the rest aboord of whose company the Marriners were not a little joyfull, for that the wind served them in such pleasing manner, to bring them to their desired Haven, whether (following the Masters direction for their course) Sailing with a faire gale, we leave them for a time to tell you of the griefe of Charondas , the Carmanian King, for the losse of his Son, of whom no manner of newes might be heard. You have heard Gentils, with what pollicy the Prince wrought, the better to bring his purposed intent to passe, and what severall pastimes were by him advised: in which severall action it was supposed by the Courtiers, himselfe would have beene a chiefe, or at least, a beholder of their sports. But he which had more Hammers working in his braine then one; taking that time as fittest for his opportunity, gave them a cause of great sorrow, as you shall heare. Whose sports ended, and every thing with great credit to the actors, and pleasure to the beholders finished, the King and Queene, whom Age now called to rest, after kind countenances, and many thankes to the Noble men and Gentiles, bad them good night, who were in all humblenesse and hearty love commended to their rest, where let them rest, untill the newes of their Sons departure be brought them, by the wofull Machaon , whose Hearts surcharged with Sorrow, could hardly be comforted, but that through the extremity of his griefe, he had resigned his latest gaspe to him who first gave him Breath.  How the Prince Armatius departing so suddenly from the Court, caused the hainous and great sorrow of the King and all his Subjects, which hee bewayleth in this wofull manner.  Mirrour of fidelity Machaon , who by all meanes either Art or Travell could imagine, enquired after the Prince, but of him could heare no tydings, whereby many supposed he was slaine: some conjectured one thing, some another. But most of all the King and Queene, their heavinesse was such, as may not without great effusion of teares be remembred, which caused a generall griefe throughout the whole Regiment. But neither sorrow of the Subjects, nor lamentation of their King, might recall him, whom they all so much desired to see, which caused the King overcharged with Melancholy, rather desiring Death then Life, breath out these Speeches. Unhappy ( Charondas ) and more unhappy, in being Father to so gracelesse a Child (oh Armatius ) why have I lived to see thee growne a man: tenderly caring to bring thee to that estate; and now my chiefest hope was in thee to have comfort, thus by thy unkind demeanour, to cause my griefe: how happy be those Parents whose Children live in obedience; but thrice accursed those Fathers, which give the bridle of youth into their hands, who ought to be held in, as the Colt untamed, with the hardest Bit. Though Wisedome presageth Lawes of government to Fathers, and experience of the Ancient which have lived in elder times giveth advise, crying out of such as give liberty to Younglings, yet law of Nature, whereunto we unhappy Parents are too much tyed, forgetting all counsels, are so besotted on those carelesse Younglings, that if they desire any thing, whether it be profitable for their instruction, or haleth them to destruction, it may not be denyed them: How many of high estate by the carelesse regard of their untoward children, have been brought to great heavinesse! Or who taking pleasure in his Offspring, can see him restrained (I but unhappy man) hast thou not heard the learned Surgion often tell his tender Patient, that it is better to smart once, then endure griefe for ever? And thou that mightest have kept thy deare Son under his Tutors custody, wherein he lived in obedience, might so have had him still, if thy owne foolishnesse had not been so carelesse of him. Then since thou hast been the cause of thine owne sorrow, blame thy selfe,  & sigh to think on thy follies: and as thou hast bin the originall of this mischiefe, not onely robbing thy country of a toward brach to succeed thee, but hast lost to thy selfe the joy of a Father, in wanting thy Son, thy lifes sole happinesse: perswade thee, that as many Countries have beene punished for the Princes offences, so this Plague is laid upon thy Subjects for thy misse. Wherefore in sorrowing for thy sinnes, and that God may shew his mercy upon thy kind Country men, sorrow for thy foppery, and abjuring thy selfe from Kingdome, Wife, and Countrey, betake thee to some unknowne place, where thou mayest spend the remainder of thy overworne yeares, in contemplation of thy sinnes, so may that God of all mercy, which never turneth his Face from the penitent, receive thee to his grace, and restore thy Sonne, calling him from his youthfull desires, to become a comfort unto those which with many salt teares, and hearts full gorged with sorrow, bewayle his absence. Thus powring forth his griefe with sighes, and many brinish teares, uttering his Sorrow, he resolved to leave all his earthly possessions, and altogether forsaking the company of all mankind, live solitary in some unfrequented place, untill it would please God some tydings should be sent him of his Sonne, or else by Death call him to those joyes which never shall have end. Thus for this time he ended his sorrowfull Speech, uttered in great griefe of mind, whom carefull for to espye time and opportunity fit for his departure, we leave for a time. And shall tell you further of the Prince Armatius , who long before this time is arrived in Trebisond .  How Armatius Prince of Carmania , arrived at the Court of Trebisond , in Habit of a Marchant, employing his stocke in Marchandise. Suddenly after, the Emperours Sonne Ottoman Barbarossa , with a great force both by Land and Sea, commanded the Countrey of Trebisond , for that the Princesse Amoretta was denied him in Marriage, whereof he sought revenge.  knowne but for a Marchant, landed now in safety, after a friendly welcome given to his fellow passengers, the Master and Owners, with bountifull rewards bestowed on the Marriners, was lodged by the Master in a Marchants house of great reputation, where unknowne to be any other then he seemed, hee imployed his stocke by Brokers, to great benefit, which bountifully he spent, whereby he gained the love of all men that ever had any acquaintance with him, so that in short time his fame was so bruted throughout the City, that none of any account, but tooke great pleasure in his company, and joyed to recount his many vertues. This amorous Prince whose heart was on his halfe-penny, loth to acquaint any man with his secret love to the Princesse, doubting some further perill to his person then he was willing to hazard, would oftentimes intrude himselfe into the company of young Courtiers, amongst whom he so demeaned himselfe, and so courtly in all things, that all men might judge from what tree such branches sprung. By this often frequenting of the Court, in the company of those to whom he was most welcome, he attained the sight of his Lady, whose beauty when he had seene, so amazed him, that if he were before passionate, he was now more perplexed, judging her excellent perfection to be without compare, yet not knowing how to make knowne his love unto her, smothering in silence his affection he daily desired some occasion might be offered, wherein for her safety, and honour of his beloved, he might shew some act worthy of honour, and to deserve her liking, which by Fortunes assistance thus happily came to passe Ottoman Barbarossa , youngest Son to Achmat Barbarossa , Emperour of Himettus , burning in love of this Princesse, onely by the rare report of her singular perfections, had by Embassadours from his Father, craved the Princesse in marriage, who disdaining his love being a Pagan, although honourable, might not be won by any intreaty to fancy him, how great soever his offers and protestations of love were; which refusall, the Prince brooked so ill, being of such might, that determining to gaine her by force for his concubine, which in friendship he had so often required to marry, he leavied a power of one hundred thousand, both on horse and foote, and shipping them in warlike manner, in Gallies, Frigate, Foystes, and Brigandioces, he arrived by the hard labour and painfull bowging of his slaves, before the City of Frontinum , where Castalinus kept his Court, landing the greatest part of his men and Horse suddenly, and beleagered the same both by Land and Sea: unto which he gave many fierce and hot assaults, and were as valiantly resisted, by the courage of those gallant Citizens, who fighting in right of their Countrey, feared not the hugenesse of their Armies, nor their force of shipping, yet as the extreames of forraine Force cause many troubles, so did the Army of Ottoman drive these brave Thracians to many wants, whose courage through the lacke of victuals began to quaile: that having no meane of reliefe neither by Sea nor Land, loth to famish, came daily to the Court, humbly beseeching the King to take pitty of them, and not with famine to suffer them dye. But considering that the Princesse was the marke whereat he aymed, would rather deliver her, who should be honourably entreated, then suffer so many thousands to perish. Castalinus vexed in mind, was driven to a non plus , so diversly perplexed, hee could not suddenly answer, his Child who was his onely comfort and Heire, either to be delivered him, whose name was odious unto him, or his Subjects who loved him no lesse then their own Soules, must perish in this extreame. Thus doubtfull what to answer, hee craved respite for two dayes, which they willingly yeelded unto, albeit their want of victuals was so great they might hardly endure. The report of this dolefull sute of the Commons comming to the eares of Armatius , who with his attire, wee change to Marianus , who was not a little moved there, and the greater was his heavinesse, by how much the more his love was increased towards the Princesse, for whose reliefe he sought many devises, eftsoones determining one thing, then another presents it selfe, which seemeth better: at length resolving, lest delayes should breed danger, he determined in that action which was so honourable, to shew himselfe, and eyther by his prowesse free the King aind his beloved from the tyranny of the vsurping Infidell, or yeeld his latest gaspe in their defence.  How Armatius naming himselfe Mariarianus , desirous to shew his force in defence of his Lady and Love the Princesse, gallantly offered his service to the King of Trebisond , and what happened him.  humble duty, and prostrating himselfe, he saith. Most gracious Soveraigne, and liege Lord, pardon the bold attempt of a rude stranger, whom dutifull zeale hath bound to your service, and of your gracious favour to all men, vouchsafe me that honour in this extream, wherein your worthy Citizens stand, distressed by this faithlesse Infidell, who doth seeke your subversion, and their utter ruine and decay: whose presumption, if it please your Excellence to give me leave, shall by me, and such as I can by love and money draw unto me, be chastened, and made to know, your Highnesse can expell at your pleasure, the power of a more strong and mighty Enemy, who though you have of courtesie suffered, it hath not beene of cowardize, as he shall well understand. In this request, most gracious and renowned Soveraigne, if it shall please you to honour me, I doubt not (by the ayde of the Highest) of a happy victory. The King, which during his long tale, had earnestly noted his countenance, and his grace, in uttering the same, assured himselfe, that the honour of his house, which shewed in his courage, or the power of the eternall Deity wrought this motion in him, and therefore without any longer pause, taking him courteously from his knees, determining to try the Fortunes of this supposed Marchant, he saith: What ever thou be that honour vrgeth to this attempt, thankes for thy love, wishing my good, and forwardnesse in venturing thy life, yet before J accept thee for my Champion, say (gentle Friend) of what Countrey art thou: what name and Parentage; to the end that I may give thee honour as thy deserts and bloud doe require: and answering mee truly to these demands, tell mee what moved thee like. wise, being so brave a man, and in thy flourishing estate, to hazard thy selfe in an action, wherein so many men of honour and great valour have lost their lives. Know renowmed Lord (quoth the Prince) Carmania is my Country, my Father a Gentleman, professing martiall Discipline, my name Marianus , the youngest of many of my Fathers Sons, unto whom my Minority denyed such revenewes and livings as might sufficiently maintaine my estate, which caused me to employ my stocke in Trade of Marchandise, by which in time of peace I gained in your Country wealth sufficient, which with my body I offer in your Highnesse service, and doubt not but to free thy Princely Daughter from this Usurper, whose vertue the world so much renowneth: for by that Faith which I received at the Font-stone, so long as I may breath life, never shall unhallowed Curre triumph in your Graces overthrow, nor in her dishonour.  How King Castalinus graciously accepted the proffered service of the Prince Armatius , now vnder the Name of Marianus a Marchant, and how by the Princesse Amoretta , hee was invested with the Order of Knight-hood, by the name of Loves Heroicke Champion .  his outward signes, the inward delight of his heart, and the desire he had to accept this younglings offer, taking great pleasure in his countenance, which was lovely, and nothing inferiour to the best in his Court, for Person, Wisdome, or other Graces, which with advise considered, he saith: Heroicke Champion , well dost thou shew thy selfe a Gentleman, for under the habit of a Marchant, Gentility cannot be hid, no poore estate can banish the Noble, nor adverse Fortune whatsoever; but as Gold is soone brought from the baser Mettals to his forme by the skilfull Finer: so are the Noble knowne by their vertues. Heroicke Champion , I have cause to honor thee for thy love  & forwardnesse as also for thy Countrey; which (without flattering thee, or any there abiding) I love for your Kings sake. But to our matter, thou seest (my deare Champion ) the millions of cares heaped upon my gray head, through the oppression of this Heathen Prince, whereby I am made more miserable then the meanest Subject within my dominions; and the more is my misery, by recounting the wretched estate of my loving Subjects whom I hold as deare as my life,  & wish that by resigning my life and Crown, I might free them from bondage; were it nothing else the Tyrant required. But, toward Gentleman, whose love (wretch that J am) I cannot requite, my daughter (O sorrow worse then death to recount) Amoretta , the only Solace of my life, and lifes sole good, in whose weale consisteth my good, and by violence offered her, what good can betide me? She, she, my deare Champion , it is, that drencheth my Soule into so deep a hell, that almost forgetting my selfe, living, I daily die; only recounting the miseries she should endure, if ye Tyrant triumph in our overthrow: but he yt in extreams sendeth comfort hath revived me,  & relieved my overcharged hart by thy kind offer; whose courage, and hope of victory being such, as thou wilt hazard thy deerest bloud for my daughters freedo. Thanks (my good Champion ) is all ye I can yet yeeld thee; yet to adde more courage to thy noble mind, fighting for us  & our honor, my daugh. for whose good thou adveturest, shal invest thee with ye order of knighthood, ye 1\. honour yt ever she gave to man of Arms, and shall pray for thy good successe: so calling for the Princesse, who was so discontented, that nothing could be pleasing unto her, who being come before him, after her humble duty done, desirous to know her Kingly Fathers will, he recounted the zeale of the Marchant unto her, who had not onely offered his goods, but also his proper life, to try in battell his Fortunes against their Enemy: wherefore Amoretta (quoth the King) for that he hath so voluntarily offered the same for thy sake, and I relying on my God, and in his prowesse, have accepted him for my Champion, by thy hand, he shall receive the honour of Knighthood, his Title, Loves Heroick Champion : and so prosper he in his honorable action, and in all others as we wish, and himselfe desireth. The Princesse, which divers times had noted the Courtly behaviour of Armatius was not a little pleased at her Fathers Motion; as one that in harty good-will, wished him better then modestie would suffer her to utter; yet harkening to her Fathers speeches she beheld him with more gracious countenance, and viewing the Lineaments of his person, each grace well regarded, she inwardly bewayled his hard happe, that the Gods had framed him of no better reputation then a Marchant, who might well deserve the Title of a King, put from her Memento , by recounting her Fathers words, pausing thereon sometime, with a modest blushing countenance, she said. Kind Sir, whose honourable Service offered for my Father's good, and all our weales, his Subjects; if I yeeld you not such recompence as your deserts do merite, blame me not of discourtesie; which have no better knowledge of you, but accept the hearty thankes of a Virgin, unto whom I hold my selfe so farre indebted, as I can no other way recompence, then wishing your good, yet in earnest of better good, refuse not at my hands to receive the honour of Knighthood, seeing my Lords pleasure is such: and drawing his Rapier, the Prince kneeling, she invested him with the order, by Name of the Heroicke Champion , and pulling a jewell of rich price from her gowne, she tyed the same in a most beautifull Scarffe, beseeching him to weare it for her sake, wishing all happy Fortune to his attempts. The new adopted Knight, whose heart over-joyed for so great a favour received from the Saint his heart wholly honoured, with many thanks dutifully rendered, kissed ye Princesse hand, vowing himselfe her humble Servant, and in all places to maintain her modest beauty and Princely honour, with his dearest bloud. The time thus passed, word was brought the King, that Dinner was ready, whereby they were interrupted, whom for a time we leave to their repast, discoursing diverfly at table, of the valour of the Heroick Champion , whose towardnesse the King admired, which made his hopes the greater: not doubting but his Champion would prove no lesse valiant in Armes then they expected. At which the Princesse gloried not a little, and the Nobles pleased at both their comforts, passed the time with more content, then many daies before, whom we leave to their mirth, and the Heroick Champion , to the ordering of his affaires.  How the Carmanian King, after he had spent some time in sorrow for the Princes departure, exiled himselfe from the Court, Pilgrim-like attired, in search of his Sonne the Prince, the Queene, with griefe for the King and her Sonne dyed.  Pilgrime, travelled many uncouth places in search for his Sonne, of whom he could heare no tydings, neither could Machaon for all the industry he could use, attaine to any knowledge of him his Heart so much desired: through which, the heavinesse both of the Peeres and Commons, were daily increased. And no marvell, when their Soveraigne the Mirrour of all Princely courtesie, had thus unknowne, in the declining of his Age, when his Yeares required rest, banished himselfe his Countrey, loving Subjects, and what else he enjoyed: the griefe of which so oppressed the Heart of the Queene, that nothing might yeeld her any comfort. But pining in continuall sorrow, utterly abandoning the Worlds comfort, to seeke her comforter, whose dwellings are in the highest Heavens, she yeelded her due to Death, whose Funerals, with the effusion of many brinish teares of the Nobles, and sorrowfull lamentations of her Subjects, was performed with such honour as to her estate required: whose obsequies finished, Machaon regarding the benefit of the Common weale, and the Princes good, of whom their hope was to learne knowledge, used so kind perswasions to the whole estate, in a Parliament holden of purpose, that the Regiment was delivered by consent, unto sixe of the chiefest Nobles, who were solemnly sworne to maintaine the dignities of the Crowne, in absence of the King and his Sonne, unto whom, being lawfull Heires to the same, they should resigne their Titles, whensoever they should challenge the same. Now Gentiles leave we these distressed people, lamenting their Kings absence and the Queenes Death, to tell you of Loves Heroicke Champion .  How the Knight Marianus , having mustered his companies, mad sute to the Princesse, that she with the King might be pleased to take view of them, and of their gracious acceptance of his forwardnesse, & honourable favours shewne vnto him. And how a Herauld, from the Campe of Ottoman , arrived at the Court.  & not unmindfull of his new Mistris, whose Love was the marke he aimed at hoping by accomplishing this victory against the Soldano , to gaine that place of reputation with her that he desired: for the better accomplishing of which, he proclaimed by Sound of Trumpet, that all such as would in that action adventure their lives with him, should bountifully be considered, all estates from the Cavaliere to the Mercery , caused many to offer him their Sonnes, so that in short time he had gathered more able men then ever in so small warning were seene; such was the love that his bounty had gained among all estates, that of their kindnesse many repaired, more then for mony, although the thought thereof is able to draw the Coward to fight, so highly was this stranger honoured. The diligence was such of this Prince, that in short time he had his Companions which were so furnished, as he lived not in those Territories that ever saw the like. All things furnished for the field, he became an earnest Sutor to the Princesse his Mistresse, to procure the King to view his Army, which with small sute she obtained for him, gracing him with all the favours she might, more delighting in him then in all the men that ever she saw. The time appointed for his Muster, after he had given directions to all such Leaders and other Officers, what course to take with their severall charge, they were conducted to the place appointed by himselfe, who mounted on a stately Courser, passed on through the City, his Captaines attired in Gascoin coates of watched Velvet, having on the breast and backe embossed with Goldsmiths worke, a Mayden head, according to his devise on his Armes, with the colour of his Mistresses Scarffe: every under Officer in like Sutes of Satten, his Mercenary men in Iackets, Hose and Hats coloured alike, which caused the beholders, to admire the stranger more then their Princesse. When the King beheld this Mirrour of honour, lest thinking he was Sonne to his loving Friend the Carmanian King, and had with great delight viewed each severall Officer  & their charge, with their order of March, and ranging in Battell, all accomplished in such Warlike manner, as seldome he had seene: and withall noted his person, with his bravery in Armour, in gallant sitting a Horse, and managing the same, his charging, running and other signes of ensuing good, giving him great thankes, he caused him to dismisse his companies for that time, to attend his pleasure at the Court, which he caused suddainly to be done, attending the Kings pleasure at the Court, as he was commanded: the newes of his arrivall, being brought to the Princesse, who had but seene with what cost and rare devises, each thing by her Servant was performed, judging likewise that his love to her was some cause, by his coulours and devises, willing to know how graciously the same was accepted, she came into the Presence: where finding her Knight, after she had with a kind & loving Congee saluted him, calling him to a Baye Window, with a modest and comely grace, she said. Sir, how much I find my selfe indebted unto you, for your proffered Service and forwardnesse, in performing the same, I will not say, that in time what wants in me to accomplish, my Kingly Father will recompence, who hath seene and well noted your diligence used for his safety, with your great cost and charge, which he will not forget. In the meane time (good Servant) for so I will henceforth call you, so you will vouchsafe to accept of ye Title: I will pray for your good successe and happy victory, whereby your Renowne may passe the furthest parts of the Earth, and our Countrey by your prowesse delivered from Heathen thraldome. Vertuous Princesse (answered Loves Heroicke Champion ) might it please your Excellence to conceive of my well meaning, as my desire is to deserve, my Fortune might be compared with the happiest that liveth. For on the Faith of a Souldier, and by the Majesty of that Saint my heart most adoreth, there is none breathing life under the celestiall Globe, that shall command the simple Service of Marianus , but your Majesty, bound thereunto by your Princely favours. Enough my good Servant (quoth the Princesse) I take your word, having great cause to believe you, seeing your forwardnesse: But good Servant, if I might under Benedicity , know the Saint unto whom your devotions are bent, I would be so bold to offer a Virgins prayer at her Shrine, for your good successe. The King overhearing their talke, brake them off thus. How now Madame, what have you that Gentleman at shrift (if so) and that his confession deserve a sharp pennance yet be good to him, he may in time amend. Your Grace (quoth the Princesse) mistakes your selfe, your Highnesse knoweth I never tooke orders, therefore my authority is not to absolve, and if by presumption J offend therein. I doubt the Fathers of our Church would reward me thereafter. But to let your Majesty know the truth, perceiving the desire he hath to doe you Service, I was bold to give him thankes: further recompence, J leave to your Excellence, who at your pleasure may better reward him. Thou hast well said (Daughter, quoth the King) putting me in mind what I should doe, lest forgetting my honour to such as well deserve, I be reckoned amongst the number of those Princes, who with faire words and kind lookes feed their Subjects, so long as they have either Patrimony or other to doe them Service, to the utter overthrow of their posterities for ever, and they so farre in debt, as they dare not shew their heads, then shall they get (perhaps) some Sute worth a hundred pounds a yeare, that have consumed many thousands, maintaining a brave Port, for his Princes Honours. What said I? a hundred pound a Yeare: nay, nor that, without the favour of such as be chiefest in authority, and are neere the Prince, whose good-will, if they can procure (it may be) they shall obtaine some small thing, scarce able to maintaine the Port of a good Yeoman: for J tell thee, such must be pleased, or else let the Princes mind be forward to reward them, and by their bounty relieve their wants, their good Natures by perswasion of such as thinke all too much which goeth from themselves, and such as they please to bestow it upon, shall be abused. This have I heard Gentle Knight, and grieve, that Honour should so unkindly be rewarded: or that any Subject should forget his duty so much, as for his owne lucre, cause those that spend their bloud in their Countryes defence, their Land and possessions, with empty purses, and heavie hearts, like men forlorne to walke the streets: exclaiming on them that should see their Service better rewarded, to the dishonour of the state they live in This my Heroicke Champion , I often recount, lest in forgetting it, I fall to infamy by committing the like; but he that gave me reason to know good, and to follow it, will never suffer me to fall into so great folly, nor let me live to forget those maimed brave men, that venture for my good and my Countries weale: for while I may breath, the Souldier shall be honoured in Trebisond , and shall reape the reward of his merits, neither shall these Droans which in such times of perils hide their heads, sucke the hony off my Garland. Like minds I wish all Princes, with carefull eyes to looke into the doings of such, who as the Moath devoureth the fine cloath, consume their Princely reputation, and drawe the Commons, who by duty are bound to love, from their Allegeance. Whilest the King was in this Speech, word was brought him, that a Herald from the Campe attended his pleasure at the Gate, requiring parly, which he suddenly granted, commanding him to be brought to his presence: this unhallowed Pagan who never feared God, nor was endued with any humanity, came unto the Kings presence, with a shamelesse countenance, used this peremptory Speech.  How the Embassadour from the Turke delivering a very peremptory message from his Lord, in disgrace of the Trebisond King, and dishonour of his Princely Daughter: the Heroick Champion , at his great suite, obtaineth the Kings favour to issue forth vpon them; his honourable exhortation, and speeches to his Companies, with their forwardnesse.  and Generall of those royall Armies, sendeth thee by me, thy choyce, either of warres or peace (peace) if thou deliver thy Daughter unto him, whom he hath so often required, yet whereas his love unto her hath beene such, to make her his wife, his noble mind despiseth her so much, as his highnesse will never so much honour her, but in despite of thee, and to abate the pride of that disdainfull Dame, he will use her as his Concubine, and when he shall have taken the flower of her Virginity, give her to the basest villain in his Campe. Thou knowest my Embassage: deliver her and live, or by me returne thy resolute answer, for it shall not be many dayes, ere thy City shall flame with fire about thine Eares. The King vexed at this unexpected Message, could not answer him, so moved was his Choller, yet with as much patience as nature would permit, he said: Pagan, I have heard, and with paine endured thy Lords peremptory Message: and that thou, and that Cur from whom thou commest, shall well know the great difference betweene a Christian and him, and that he understand how honourable we hold the law of Armes. I pardon thee thy life, which thy presumpeion doth require sharply to be punished. For answer to thy Lord, this briefly say, his threats I regard not: for my Daughter, as God hath given her me, and for she is the onely joy of my aged life, I will shield her, and in despite of the Pagan, and his greatest power defend her chastity: therefore depart, and say to thy Lord from me, his threats I wey no more then the words of a child: it is not his multitudes can daunt me, were they ten times more then they are, my Daughter J will hold in despite of his beard, proud Usurper that he is. Thou knowest my will, make no stay. The Herald noting the sterne countenance of the King, and hearing his resolution, thought it not good to stay a reply, lest his tongue swelling in his mouth, might not be eased without losse of his head; but glad to escape his fury, conveyed him from his presence, with all speed he could, posting to the Pavilion of the Prince, unto whom he delivered the Kings resolute answer: which he no sooner heard, but like one besides himselfe, he vowed in three dayes to be revenged of the old churle, who should taste the bitternesse of his youthfull fury. Little knoweth this proud Enemy, the preparation made to bid him welcome, or that his owne destruction was so neare as after it proved. The Heroicke Champion , which with no small griefe had endured this proud demand of the Herald, whose whole request was for dishonour of her, he so much honoured, awaked from Melancholy, and out of a sound sleepe, protesting himselfe before the King, he saith: Renowned Soveraigne, with what griefe I have endured the presumption of this Usurper, my heart denieth my tongue to utter, neither shall I have joy of any thing, till I revenge the wrongs offered your Majesty and your Princely Daughter, upon that Dogge. Wherefore dread Lord, grant me Licence to issue out of the City with my Companies, in the silence of the Night, and J hope ere long to return his proud challenge, with my Sword in his Throat. Thanks good Knight, quoth the King, I accept thy offer as much, as if thou hadst given me the whole World in possession, yet would I not so forward a man should adventure himselfe without my company, whose cause it is, my selfe will accompany thee in the fight, and by my Herald bid him battell, in which I doubt not of successe. The Knight was much moved, to heare his sute take no better successe, yet not willing to endure any competitor in the Honour he hoped of, humbly besought his Majesty of the honour he bare to Armes, in this attempt to give him leave, and the rather for the Reputation of the Princesse, which had given him his first honour. The King which saw by his countenance how mal content, he rested at this deniall, how loth soever he were to grant the same, yet yeelded to his desire: and taking him from his knee, lovingly embracing him, he saith. Brave man at Armes, take not in ill part, that I have denyed, neither thinke that it was in any sort to disparage you, or the hope I have of your forwardnesse, but for maintaining my owne honour; yet seeing your will is to adventure for me, goe in Gods name, and he be your defence, that ever comforteth his distressed: and so pulling his Signet from his finger, he gave it him, willing that it be delivered to the Governour of the City, and let him understand his Highnesse pleasure was, that (he with his Army) passe at his pleasure: and so taking his humble leave of the King, and his gracious Mistresse, which affecteth him more then he could conceive, he departeth more joyfull of this honour, then to be richly endowed. No sooner parted he the Kings presence, but slacking as little time as was possible, he summoned his Captains, and Officers, straightly charging them with all ye diligence they could use, to gather their Companies, and to attend him in the Market place, in which charge no negligence was used, so that by shutting in of the Evening, each Captaine with his charge, both Horse and foote, attending the comming of their Generall, who was not unmindfull of his businesse,  & after thanks given to their Leaders, he marched wth them to ye gate that led the to the Camp of the Soldan, and was upon sight of the Kings Signet let out. Thus marched the Noble Prince, untill he came halfe way, betweene the Campe, and the City, where he called his principall men together, and said: Friends and Copartners in Armes, you are now to consider what we have taken in hand, for that on our weale dependeth the whole estate of this Common weale; if we prevaile, what good it is to be freed from such an enemy, there is not the simplest but can conceive, having tasted the extremity which is incident to Warres, and the pleasure of peace. Contrary, the slavery and servile lives which these are compeld to endure that fall into their hands, you may imagine, by the opprobrious usage of your gracious Prince, and example of other Christians, which have fallen into their hands. Wherefore now is the time to shew your selves in this battell, if you shew your Force, no doubt of happy successe, to your Eternall commendations, and to the benefit of your Country, and freedome of your Wives, Children, and Families. With these, and other such speeches, he so incouraged the hearts of his followers, as they vowed to follow him with the hazard of their dearest bloud.  How Marianus accompanied with a gallant Troope, assailed the Turke in his Campe, against whom he obtained a most honourable victory.  by outward motions, was as he expected, after he had given them many thanks, he made choyce of five hundreth to beare him company. And after he had given directions for the Army to follow, he with his elected Company marched on as closely as they might, for descrying of the Enemy, who kept a Court of Gard not farre from thence, upon whom in the dead of the Night they entred, and finding them at the advantage (who little doubted any assault, having never beofre beene assailed) some sleeping, some gaming, and others as ill imployed, they surprized them, and left not one to beare tydings of their ill Fortune. This first attempt well performed, he passed on with all speed to the Campe, where the Prince lay, suddenly entred the same, where like a resolute and Noble Gentleman, he so behaved himselfe, that it filled the hearts of his followers with great courage, who behaved themselves in such manner, that few escaped with life, but such as were grievously maimed so that they rather desired death, then longed to live. The Prince who was by one of his Bashawes counselled to flye, as the least evill, for avoiding of death, was bravely mounted on a swift running Gennet, of which the Heroick Champion being informed, leaving the fight, he posteth after with so good Speed, as the harmlesse Hare, from the cruell jawes of the Greyhounds, such haste made this worthy Conquerour; that in evill time for the Prince, he overtooke him, accompanied with 12. of his principall Bashawes , whom he with courage so assailed, that in a moment he had vanquished them all, leaving some breathlesse, some without armes, others without legges, no one escaped his fury. In which conflict the Prince escaped, but all in vaine, the Destinies had determined there to finish the honour of that journey, by the hands of the Heroicke Champion . Who overtaking him, gave him so grievous a blow with his Curtelex betweene the necke and shoulders, as made him forget his way, saying: Stay proud Vsurper, and take my Lady the Princesse with thee; and pulled him violently, with all the force he could by the Helmet unhorsed him, that the Knight verily supposed he had beene slain: wherefore dismounting himselfe, he revived him againe, unto whom he said. My Lord, this is not for your Honour to brave a King in his own Dominions and in his Court, by your Herald, and then to have so small a care of your word. In Faith Pagan (for thy sake) Ile never credit any Heathen on his word hereafter. Pitty is it a Prince of your esteeme should after so many Lectures read, play the Trevant (trust me) were I your Father, I should twigge the Youth well, to learne him hereafter to be more carefull of his businesse. The Prince hearing himselfe so frumped, was more grieved thereat, then of all the losse he had received. Wherefore with a heart full of carefull heavinesse, he saith: Brave man at Arms, what ere thou be, to whom Fortune hath made me thrall, ill beseemeth such words of disgrace, to any one whom the Fates have overthrowne, but cursed be my selfe, which gave thee this opportunity, cursed that negligence, which maketh my Foe thus to tryumph in my fall. Thou Mahomet , suffer me not as thou art a Prophet, to live thus disgraced, to behold the Face of any man, surprized by so cowardly a Curre, who daring not to thrust his head out of the kennell but by stealth, hath wrought my utter ruine and overthrow, taking his advantage. But glory not in this victory, for it may be, thou shalt have so great cause to repent thee thereof, as pleasure to behold me now thy Prisoner. Your Lordship is disposed to be pleasant (qd. the Knight) but it is the vse of Christians to give losers leave to speake, if it so happen, my Fortune shall be the worse: In the meane time your Grace shall be my guest, I have an Hosts provided, will bid you welcome, who by this time, I doubt not, doth heare of your comming, that you need not feare of your Dinner. The Prince full of heavinesse, could not tell what to answer, wherefore arming himselfe with all the patience he could to endure it, he was by this Conquerer, commanded to horse. Long had they not ridden towards his Army, but he was encountred by divers of his Captaines, who missing their Generall, at hap-hazard, put themselves in search for him, and happily well they met him, who rejoycing at his good Fortune, taking the Prince prisoner, they recount unto him the ruine and spoile of the whole Army; for which their diligent courage and valor shewed, he yeeldeth them most great and hearty thankes, beseeching them to take charge of his Army, and divide the Spoyles amongst them; which done, repaire at their pleasures to the City, whilest he with his Prisoner, made hast to the Kings presence. The tidings of the Knights successe, was by some (such as honoured him) with speed reported at the Court, in which no part of his honours was left unrecounted, whose policy and valiantnesse in Armes, the King with all the Courtiers admired: Imagining him by these worthy deeds of Chivalry, to be the onely man at Armes, deserving honour in all that Region: of whom there was no small joy, and such Fame and renowne of his actions, as both in City and Court there was no talke, but tended to the honour of the Heroicke Champion , which liked not the Princesse Amoretta a little, to heare her Servant in these his first attempts, venturing for her (to have such Fortunate successe) so that where she had begun to like him before ( Cupid ) that commandeth the mightiest, began most furiously for to assaile her, so that her tender heart vanquished therewith, was inforced to yeeld her selfe a slave unto his Deity: and giving over other Court-like delights, bend her whole study in seeking which way to winne her best beloved to her liking, for the accomplishing of which, many wayes were devised and plotted, but none thought sufficient; to that resting in a Labyrinth of confused thoughts, commanding her attendants from her, she said:  The Princesse Amoretta , falleth in love with her Champion Marianus , he arriveth at the Court in great honour, presenting the Turkish, Prince with his Bashawes: with their pleasant Discourses at their meetings, and honours done to Loves Heroicke Champion .  thy self, who yeelding to follow ye follies of thy youthfull mind, hast planted thy Love thou knowest not on whom, a stranger, and of no more Reputation then a Marchant, a base Trade, and most fraudulent, as J have heard many Nobles discusse, whereby they obtaine to great wealth: and by their extraordinary meanes, wring such young Gentlemen as are forced to have to doe with them, from their ancient Patrimonies, making of Noble men and Gentiles of great worship, Beggars, and their owne base borne Brats, to become young Masters, which in time, and small time, consume that in Ryot, which their miserable Fathers by extortion, false reckonings, unsatiable Usury, and other loose dealings, sold their Soules, the precious Image of our Saviour to the Divell. But wretched wretch, whither wandrest thou? these be no points for thee to stand upon, thou hast now vied the Game, and art bound by such a Band, as there is no remedy but see it thou must: therfore leave to discourse what he was, or hath beene. Thou hearest by generall report of all men, he is honourable, in Wars valiant, bountifull, and endewed with all manner of Gentleman-like conditions, which argueth him discended of better Parentage, then he will acknowledge. And therefore cease not to love him, who by all conjectures, if outward shewes proceed of the motion of the Heart, regardeth thy Honour; then requite his Service Amoretta , and seeke in time to quench that flame, which beginneth but yet to warm, lest increasing by little and little, it consumeth thee. In extreames the Noble mind is best known, happy are they accounted, which forewarned can eschew a mischiefe; If thou canst win thy Love, what creature may be compared with thee for happy content? Be resolute Amoretta , feare no colours, thy love is planted on such a one, who for his vertues may be mated with the greatest Princesse on the earth: then stand not on termes of his being, but determine to love him, faint hearted Souldier never gained conquest, if he be base thou maist advance him. Thou art Heire to the Crowne of Trebisond , and thy Fathers Sole delight, who then should gainsay thy will herein (Fathers Sole delight said J) yea there Amoretta , lyeth a blocke which thou canst hardly remove. Thy Father, what will he aged King say? when shall he heare of thy love so basely planted, which hast refused to be Wife to two famous Kings, requiring thee with great Sute in marriage: Refraine Fondling from this rash determination, let thy Fathers love be a Raine to hold thy unbrideled will, feare his displeasure which gave thee life, and seeke not by thy folly to bring his head with Sorrow to his grave, which if thou persist will be such a corasive to his hart, and such a staine to thine honour, as the memory of Amorettaes disobedience will never be razed out. With these and such like motions of good, she sought to withdraw her love from him, that for birth and other noble actions deserved her better, albeit unknowne to her: but what ever he be, the more she sought to suppresse the flame of her love, the more it encreased: that without regard of Fathers good, or her own honour, she determined to love him: yea the Hesoicke Champion with his Prize, was arrived at the Court, whom the King and Nobles welcommed with all courtesie they could shew, as joyfull of his safe returne, who had so honourably borne himself in that action, as if he had conquered Europe , which kindnesse to the Knight, was recompence sufficient for all his charge and hard adventure. The Princesse, who was awaked from her studies by report of the Knights, comming, sumptuously attired, as she could, as beseemed her estate, accompanied with all her troope of Ladies and Maids of Honour, came unto the Presence, who no sooner approached the place where the Knighe was, but the beholding the exquisit perfection of her beauty which he so much delighted in, was suddainly bereaved of his Senses, so that he stood as a man which had lost himselfe, yet reviving, loath to make manifest with what great griefe he had concealed so long: humblyon his knees, presented the glory of his Enterprise unto her, saying. Most gracious Princesse, as by your most excellent hands J received my first steppe to honour, and fighting for your Graces and Kingly Fathers sakes, it hath pleased God to prosper me with a happy victory, for which good, having nothing worthy to present your Grace as J desire, yet in knowledge of my duty to your Excellence to who my life and Service is devoted, I hubly beseech you, accept this Gentleman my Prisoner, and your Noble Fathers mortall Enemy. The Princesse, to whom nothing could be more pleasing, then the sight of her beloved Knight, graciously accepted the Prisoner, rendring geeat thanks for the same, as also for his valour shewed in her defence. And then turning to the captived Prince, she said. My Lord, you see the chance of Fortune, and how mutable she is in all actions, sometimes fawning, sometimes frowning, but whither by your Fortune, or cowardise, or both, you are now at their mercy, whose overthrow you assured your selfe off, and which you more desired then all the Territories of the Earth, but our God which never suffereth his Servants to perish, hath mightily defended us: it is not your mighty powers can dant the hearts of Christians, whose God is their guide: neither regard we them at all as a matter of any trust, your eyes can witnes, who having an Army able (as you thought) to have vanquished all Christendome, is by a handfull to your multitudes surprized. Yet dismay not my Lord, a Champion is your laylor, who will use you more honourably then you can imagine, or your hard threats deserve. The Prince which saw the beauty of the Princesse, whom he so earnestly upon reports had desired, was astonied greatly, holding ye same that was bruted, to be nothing to her worthinesse, therfore accusing himselfe of great impiety, that had borne Armes against the onely Paragon of the Earth, and not by courtesie have continued his love begun, ashamed of himselfe, he saith. Renowned Lady, Fortunes darling,  & Beauties chiefe pride, though mishap hath made me of a Prince and Heire to the mightiest Potentate of the earth, a captive and that by thy Champion I am dishonoured, and my power vanquished crosses which may cause the stoutest that ever lived, to cry out on Fortune, & to curse the Destinies, yet am I comforted in ye sweetnesse of your words, which disdaineth to use the utmost cruelty you might, or take his life that had vowed to use you with more extreams, then if by the greatest torments I could have afflicted you withall, I had caused you by many thousand deaths, if it were possible so many could be incident to one body. Had I prevailed of thy courtesie famous Princesse, I cannot say what I would, but vow unto thee by the honor of my Fathers Crown, while I breath to remaine a true Liegeman unto thee vertuous Amoretta , whose courtesie hath subdued my choller, and put my oppressed heart from a million of cares wherewith it was opprest. My Lord (qd. the Princesse) your Lordship is merrily disposed, indeed women are Gods children, won with a toy, such Fooles they are: yet my Lord I would you did know, how little I esteem the flattery of men, of what estate soever, they would spend their frivolous Speech elsewhere, for your Lordship, though you please to jest, I thank God you have such cause to doe, whom I praise for the victory received, and next his duty, my Servant for his pains imployed for our safety. And with these words she gave him so gracious a look, as well might the standers by see it was not fained, but that her Speech spoken in his praise, proceeded of ye inward motions of the heart, which of the captive Prince was not unperceived, which caused him to reply thus. Madame, for avoiding of that odious sinne of flattery, which my heart hath ever contemned, I dare not to say what I would, yet seeing the Destinies are so pleased, to yeeld me a prisoner to my enemy, I reckon my unhappinesse the lesse, which have so gracious a Lady for my keeper, of who, expecting no better then death, I am by your comfort quite deprived of ye feare. And for this noble Gentleman, how Fortune and the Fates hath favoured him in this victory, wherin I am so dishonoured, every man cannot conceive. But were the honour thereof a million more, yet not to be weighed in the ballance where your Grace doth counterpoise ye same, which is more to be esteemed then the worlds good: how you hold him in regard J know not, but if an Enemies praise may any way honour him, I say, and with my bloud will a vouch, that for his valor none liveth on the confines of the earth his equall: wherefore Madam, boast you of his worthinesse which is Peerlesse, and worthy for all perfections, to be honoured of the mightiest Monarch that liveth.  How Marmaricus King of Hungaria who had suffered ship-wracke at Sea in a storme was brought on share in Trebisond on a Rafte, with his royall entertainment by the Gentlemen of the Countrey, and his honourable welcomes to the Count, by the King and his Nobles.  I doubt not but he will say as much for you, when opportunity shall serve, who I assure you is as courteous, as otherwise honourably endued. While they were thus pleasantly discoursing, word was brought the King, that Marmaricus Prince of Hungaria who by the outrage of a cruell storm, had suffered shipwracke, was found on a Raft, driven ashore on the farthest parts of his confines: where being unknowne to any of his Subjects, but by his own report, was by the Gentlemen of his Countrey entreated, as beseemed his estate: and accompanied with a Princely traine, was within halfe a daies journey of the Court. The suddaine report whereof, brake their talke, the King commanding his traine presently to be ready horsed to accompany him, who with diligence failed not to obey his command: and so orderly marching through the City, they ride easily paced, untill they meete the stranger King, between whom great courtesie was used. The King gave thanks and loving countenance to the Gentlemen, who had to their great cost so honoured him, by entertaining this stranger, whereby his Countrey was made famous. Thus with divers discourses they passed the time, till they came to the Court, where a stately Lodging was prepared for him, and Officers appointed to attend his person, as royally as if he had beene in his owne Pallace, where solacing with the King and his Nobles, we leave him.  How Marianus , being now in Court, in sight of his Love and Lady, affections began to revive, and a melancholy passion possest him, which was noted of many, but chiefly of the Princesse, with their honourable parley, and favourable proffers.  with the scorching flames of this his mistresses beauty, had so much changed his colour, and impaired his strength, that enforced by great griefe and extremity of his love, he withdrew him to his chamber, where casting himselfe on his bed, with a million of carefull thoughts eftsoons, determining to seeke the Princesse favour: And then by contrary motions, fearing the successe of his sute, carrying the report of no better then a Marchant, which might give cause of great dislike, and disparage his Sute, he saith; Miserable Armatius , whom the Fates continually cause by their hard hap daily to complaine, cursing the time of thy nativity, and the starres which governed thine aspects, wch neither time nor place can remedy, faint-hearted wretch, ye seeking thine owne overthrow, encreasest thy griefe, by concealing the cause. Leftest not thou thy Princely Father, to come hither, where thou mightest enjoy the presence of thy beloved mistrisse, and in doing her Service, to acquaint her with thy love: and cowardlike shamest thou to let her know thy zeale, whose courtesie is without compare, and every way sheweth in what regard she holdeth thee, that hath procured her liberty in adventuring thy life, a pleasure that of a thankful mind can never be forgotten. What knowest thou whether her love be as much to thee, whom womanly modestie denieth to reveale, else mightst thou happily know it? No, no, fondling, thy Fortune is not so happy, which ever hast lived in unhappinesse, yet despaire not, nor like a wretch die in thy Cabinet. Rowse thee, and consider what thou art, give not over thy desires to miserable death, without acquainting her with thy love: spare to speake,  & spare to speed. A Proverbe not so old as true, which if thou follow, will either give thee comfort by her courteous grant, or by deniall, hasten thy death, by which thou shalt be freed from these torments enjoying life, & living, enjoy thy sweet delight, or by death end these torments. In this resolution having banished despaire, arming himselfe with hope of good successe, stretching his weake limbes, he hasteneth to the Presence, whose absence had beene noted of most Courtiers attendant there, but especially of the Princesse, who (albeit) found the company unfurnished, wanting his company, yet durst not enquire of him, doubting the suspition of jealous eyes. But Fortune who had so long spurned at him with her foote, gave him this opportunity to raise him, whom she had like to have overthrowne, chancing to looke out of a window which opened into a Parke belonging to the Court, he espied the Princesse, pleasantly passing the time with her Traine of Ladies, which opportunity he was not willing to lose, but with all such speed as his fainting legges could make, revived by the sight of his sweet chase, with all sailes spread, in short time he recovered his wished desire, who was no sooner of the Princesse seene, his humble duty done and she having required the same, giving him the time of the day, with a most pleasant & friendly countenance, she challenged him of negligence, who she had not seene in two or three daies: and leading him politikely, pretending matters of importance, to impart unto him, from the company, she brought him neare the side of a faire Copse, which so overshadowed them, that the Sunne beames could not offend them, where they might both boldly say whatsoever it pleased them, without being heard or seene of any, which might interrupt them, which caused her to take opportunity to discusse with him thus. Servant (quoth she) I pray thee say, of the duty thou hast vowed thy mistresse, & by those sweetthoughts which are best pleasing unto thee, what is the Lady to who thy love is dedicated: for love doubtlesse thou dost, thy countenance bewrayeth it, which J have noted, with more regard then becommeth a Maiden: yet of care to thee, whose health I tender, for thy courtesie and good Service done, which I would requite in the best manner I might; and for thy lookes shew thy heart craveth to be pittied of thy Lady, let me know her, who may chance stand thee in some stead, for women may prevaile much one with another. The Knight wrapt into a heaven of joyes, hearing the Goddesse of his devotion, with such favour and kindnesse to use him, with a blushing countenance standing at the barre before her, whose Sentence pronounced, was either life or death; he saith. Honourable and gracious mistresse, give me leave so to call your Highnesse, since you have gained a Captive the Title of your Servant, and pardon my presumption, answering your demand; that I love I cannot denie, which argueth your skill in Physick great (whom) my tongue is restrained to reveale: but if your Highnesse could judge whose love I most adore, and long have, and judging ease me, J should have cause to say, no Physick proferer on the earth whatsoever; might compare with my gracious Mistresse for skill: I dare say no more, fearing to offend. The Princesse all this time gazed on the perfection of her Servant, as deeply enamoured of his perfection, as the Knight in veagled with hers, for her Eye made a Survey of his excellet feature, which she found more perfect, by how much the more she had bent her liking to love him. Thus Love which had assailed both their hearts, endued them with such a Sympathy of joy, beholding themselves all alone, that with over much joy they were striken mute, so that how much soever their hearts desired, to let each other know their loves, they could not reveale the same. In this Heaven of happy content they had not long beene, but Syrita a Lady, that attended the Princesse, brought her word, the King her Father, with the King of Hungary was comming into the Parke, which place they had chosen to recreate themselves: Where passing on by faire Paris , they diligently listen to the sweet records of the pritty Birds who skipping from Tree to Tree, gave as well the content beholding it, as the Eare pleasure in their notes: great was the delight they received viewing the beauty of the place, which for pleasant Walks, sweet Groves, and fruitfull Trees of all sorts was matchlesse: into which, many pleasant brookes had recourse; on the bankes of which, finding the place beautified with Natures gifts, they sat them downe, earnestly beholding the pleasure of the Fishes, how prittily they chased one the other, with many a pleasant conceived Toy, which they noted, censuring of each severall action, as they thought best to increase their mirth. When some time was spent in this pleasant manner Castalinus King of Trebisond finding himselfe all alone with the King of Hungary , having never questioned of him his unhappy Fortune, began with him thus.  How the King of Hungary commoned with the King of Trebisond . The Princesse Amoretta discovereth her love. The Heroicke Champion by a Leeter craveth the Princesse liking. The Knights Letter to the Princesse.  selfe so farre into thy familiarity, to require the cause of your Graces travell, through which your life was so endangered, if you vouchsafe me this favour, you shall command a matter of more import, so it please you, at my hands. The Hungarian King attending his unexpected question, was driven into such sundry thoughts, that his colour shewed better his discontent to recount it, then his tongue ablenesse to answer the Kings demand, how willing soever he was to satisfie him, yet after some pause taken, he saith. Right courteous and Mirrour of the world for Nobility, though nothing can be more displeasing to my troubled heart, then recounting my adverse Fortune, yet that your Grace shall not find any ingratitude in me, at whose hands I have received such honourable entertainment, attend me. It is not many yeares, since Mantonna , my Father deceased, who left me (unhappy I) his successour, to inherit the Crown, which I did not long enjoy, before Mimaleon King of Æ gypt , requested of me my Sister in marriage; who being beautifull, and in the flourishing time of her yeares, having not yet attained to the full of fifteen, young enough to be bestowed, yet of that Wisedome, that I referred the choice of her Love to her owne liking, induced thereunto, by the many evils hapning by such made Marriages, where the Children are forced by the covetous desires of their Parents, to join wealth to wealth: others for great Patrimonies, all for Lucre, few or none for love. But whither the beauty of my Sister Timoclea (for so was she called) or the desire of her Dowry, which was great, or either of them, or both, I cannot say, but my Sister being made acquainted with his sute, I craved her answer, for which his Embassadors attended at my Court, with the best entertainment I could give, whom my Sister Timoclea with her owne mouth answer'd (woe is me) unhappy the tongue that pleaded deniall to his Suite, but most of all, unhappy the houre when first of all he determined to crave her at my hands, in whose power it was not to grant. No sooner arrived his Nobles at the Court, and he scarcely received the Summe of her answer, but as one bereft of all honour, reason, and government, he vowed revenge on me and my Country. And leavying a mighty power, both of Horse and Foot, assailed me in mine owne Territories, whom by the mighty power of the Almighty, I expelled my Land, to their great dishonour, and no small losse unto my Subjects. Yet how great soever his overthrow was (an honorable mind I must say) were the cause just, he ordained as mighty power by Sea, whereof being by espials advertised, of the time (as neare as they could gesse) they would be ready, with a power well shipped  & furnished, I met him neare his owne Confines, where a mortall fight was begun, and most valiantly continued, neither side giving any shew of fainting. But alas, too soone commeth that grief, which melteth my hart into thousands of teares, to recount the Admirall of mine own Squadron being sunck, and two others forced by the cunning hand of their Gunners, to lye by the Lee, the rest fainted: which being perceived by the Enemy, they boorded, and by hundreths entred my Ships & Gallies, who were valiantly repulsed. But men can do no more then God will give them leave: So long they continued the Fight, that the Scupars gushed bloud, as they had often with the water delivered by the Pumpe. And here lay some maimed, and there a number slaine. This pittifull Stratageme, when my heart with heavinesse beheld, being so hardly assailed my selfe, after that I was cleared from the Heet, the wind favouring me with a happy gale, and my ship being good of saile, I forsooke the Fight, in hope to have recovered into mine owne Country, and with a new supply, have given him welcome thither. But my hopes herein deceived, a boysterous storme growing, the Sea who is mercilesse, arose in extremity, swelling wth such outrage that my battered ship no longer able to endure her cruelty, was put against our wills, on thy Coast, my Pilot unacquainted with the same, & a hoary mist overspreading the Land, suddenly the ship stucke, being neare the shore, which drave us to great terrour. Which to remedy, the Marriners did their best, but in vaine strive they that labour against his will that commandeth all. What should I say the outrage of the storme was such, as forced the ship upon the Lee shore which gave us all cause to remember our Maker, and with harty prayer to crave his assistance: But our comfort was comfortlesse, our ship split and wee all driven to make what shift we might, my self hapning on the main Yard, after that I had beene grievously beaten at Sea, the whole night was driven ashore on your confines, where I ver heard of any other that were saved. With this, the tears restrain'd his speech that he could not speake, which moved the King to more pitty of his estate, and friendly embracing him, he said; No more my Lord at this time, I am sorry that I have given you such cause of griefe, thus by recounting so lamentable a state, to renew your passed griefes. But comfort good King, when Tydes be at the lowest, they spring againe. If the Egyptian King be so extreame, reason with courtesie will not content him, the cause being no other, but to force ye love of a woman unto him, of wch (perhaps) he were better be without: On ye word of a King, and by my honour I sweare, I will not leave you, untill J see you setled in your Kingdome. Thus the King who Sorrow had overburthened, was by the comfort of this noble King (his Hoast) recomforted, whose whole study was now in preparing of an Army to aide him, unto which care we leave them. Amoretta , whose restlesse Passions neither time nor place could alter, burning in these remedilesse thoughts, considering the pennance her loving heart was like to endure, she fell into this humor. Amoretta how have the Fates ordained to make thee unhappy; that thou being delivered from an oppressing Enemy, then steps in Love to begin a new Tragedy. Thou seest her fawnings is but flattery, then seeke to eschew them, enter not too far in the Foord, lest minding but to wet thy shooe, thou plunge over head and Eares. Thy years (albeit not many) with the Examples of others, whom thou hast read, may learne thee to be wise: if thy Fancy be fixed on such vanity as may breed thy Sorrow, expell it as thou mayst, suffer not Love to harbour in thy heart, for harbored, he commonly pleads possession; and once possest, neither force nor intreaty may remove him, so ambitious a Tyrant is he, that void of pitty, against law and all hostility, he holdeth what he list. Alas Amoretta , if thy Enemy be such, what availeth thee? thou maist wish to be freed from his tyranny, but canst never avoid it, so imperious is he, yet not manly, but as a Coward, making the breach, where the wall is weakest: poore women are the markwherat most commonly he aimeth, who being by nature pittifull, are easie to believe, and by too light credit, are taken by them they best like of. Thus (poore wench) dost thou nothing but heave Feathers against the wind, which returne into thine own Eyes: thy Speeches uttered in Loves dishonour will be challenged, and like a Traiterous Rebell to his Deity shalt thou be convicted, arraigned, and condemned, for depraving his Godhead. If it be death (fondling) to speak against the Majesty of a Prince, what is it to contemne the powers above? The best remedy thou hast in reconciliation, wherwith the Gods are pleased, and hartily sorrowing for thy misse, yeeld thy selfe vanquished: and yeelding, seek by favour, to attend the end of thy desires. Thy love is matchlesse, and doubtlesse honourable, his countenance sheweth the true badge of Nobility, and his valour and bounty doe answer, what his other perfections doe promise: J have often heard it spoken, that womens helps in extremity have been great; if that be true proofe Amoretta , call thy wits together, and so end thy torments, by enjoying thy hearts content, so much discontent, by yeelding to the same. Thus resolved, without longer stay, she called unto her Syritha , her chiefe Attendant, who from her infancy had bin brought up with her: In this Syritha she conceived her greatest hope, unto whom she said: Syritha , since I had reason to discerne good from evill, thou knowest how J have tendered thee, and how willing I would be to seeke thy preferment: make try all when thou please, so shalt thou be assured of that, which justly thou maist hold in suspence. But leaving these conjuring words, I must Syritha commit vnto thy secrets a matter of import, whereon my honour and reputation dependeth. For I tell thee Syritha , I have made choice of thee amongst all those which I may command, as of her I love, and have best cause so to do, having had such society, else should I rather chuse to dye ten thousand deaths, then reveale it. Syritha which had her whole hope of good from the Princesse, hearing her speeches, with tears standing in her eyes, proceeding of joy, for the honour done her by her Lady, protested unto her by Heavens Maker, and what else he framed to be secret in her determinations, and do her best endeavour to accomplish whatsoever she commanded. The Princesse taking her word for currant, in whom she never found deceit, said; Syritha , that it is incident to all creatures in their kind to love, I know thy wits be not so simple, but thou canst conceive, and he that frameth us, directeth our likings as best pleaseth him, be it Prince or Beggar, from the highest to the simplest, and he (my Syritha ) hath linked my liking, to a most brave toward Gentleman (on whom I thinke) if assectio, which is blind, deceive me not, is worthy to be mated with the greatest in degree on the Earth. To keepe thee with frivolus speech, is no time now, having other matter enough to discourse: therfore that thou maist know him to whom my love is united, Marianus the new adopted Knight is he ( Marianus ) famous for his valour, renowned for his bounty, and admired for courtesie: He, he, Syritha is the joy of my heart (and my hearts sole delight) without whom I cannot live, no I will not live, J neither may I live, such is the Service my heart hath vowed in love unto him: therefore if thou love me as thou hast profest, by thy industry seek to save my life, which cannot but perish not obtaining my desires. Syritha listning to her discourse, willing to become 2. in this Comedy, had her braines beating already in search of the charge committed unto her, yet would she not answer any thing suddenly, considering how displeasing speeches spoken out of time, be unto Lovers corrasives: yet chearing the Princesse; she requested untill the next morning, respite for answer, which the Princesse granted, affying greatly in her, which was wise and well demeaned, many wayes (sometime doubtfull) somtime pleasing, sifted her Senses to the proofe, whom to her study we leave. The Heroicke Champion , whose extreames were farre more (if more might be) after his abrupt parting with his Mistris, that he grew so melancholy, as nothing (were it Viands) to relieve his weake Corpes, neither the daintinesse of pleasing sweet Musicke wherewith his Friends presented him, might any way delight him, so that in outragious manner, he exclaimed on his misfortune, cursing the Tidings bearer of the Kings repaire to the Parke, and his tongue for not revealing his griefe, his Physitian so ready to heare, that despairing of his hope to enjoy her, he was likely to mischieve himselfe: yet reaso affirming, that the learnedst Physitian could not discover the Disease of his Patient, without he shew it, how neare soever he guesse. Entring further in consideration of her favourable speeches, shaking off feare, like a hardy Souldier, he determined in writing to let her know his love, since he had no hope to meet her againe at the like advantage. Therefore like the condemned, hoping of pardon, liveth the Knight, yet desirous to be resolved, either of comfort or despaire, he calleth for Pen and inke, and wrote thus:  happinesse, and hearts content. Monarchs have been forced to seek the iove of beautifull Ladies, I have the lesse cause to accuse my Fortune, or exclaime against his Soveraignty, who hath framed my heart to like and love your Excell: how long I have honoured (thee onely) I omit, or to impart the many griefes endured for your sake, which as you are by nature pittifull, so vouchsafe to credit the lines of your sworne Servant, and by your favour reclaime from the gates of death, my soule which is ready to leave this wretched corps, vpon your deniall. Therefore peerlesse Lady, if thou hold the life of thy Servant, in any regard, grant me thy love, and with thy love, gracious liking: so shall I live to honour thee, or dye through thy cruelty. I write not as a Poet, but as a Souldier, to your Highnesse: and therefore if thou dislike these lines, atiribute the shortnesse of my stile, to my faithfulnesse, which without flattery, have delivered the summe of his misery, and hope shall be by your gracious courtesie eased. So attending your answer, either of life or death, I wish thy joyes never to have an end, and my selfe speedy death, without your liking. Your Graces, in life most humble, Marianus .   How Loves Heroicke Champion procured Siritha , the Princesse awayting woman, to deliver his Letter, and then parley.  find by many devises which he sought, how it should be brought to his Mistresse hands, at length after many sundry wayes sought, this was thought best: calling to mind Syritha , the Princesse Maid, which he had often noted to be in some regard with her, he determined to procure her, either of courtesie, or for reward to deliver it. And very early in the morning, assoone as he could get ready, addressed himselfe to the Court, attending the comming of his Mistresse thither, as she usually did but unhappy Marianus , it fell not out sowell with him this day, for ye Princesse distempered in her thoughts, hath her mind so much of her love, and how to obtaine it, as she enjoyed no sleepe by night, nor content by day, so that she was inforced with weaknesse to keepe her Chamber, to the great discomfort of the King, and griefe of all ye Ladies. But as many crosses are incident to Lovers: so Cupid which is good to some that serve him (albeit) the newes of his Ladies malady was burthensome to him, yet this pleasure it brought him: it fortuned Syritha , with whom his chiefe desire was to have some Speech, passing into the Garden either to walke, or for some occasion of her Ladies, whom Marianus followed with a cheerfull countenance, more like a Novice in Loves Schoole, then any wayes skilfull; yet whetted on by the hopes his heart conceived, he saluted the Gentlewoman, who was not a little abashed to see ye Knight so neere her, nor could she judge any cause of his comming unto her, yet as she was courteous, as willing to heare what he would say, as he to utter the same, with a face blushing, shewing a kind countenance, she enquired of his health, with other ordinary prattle: which he answer'd, returning her many thanks, said; Mistresse Syritha , though my deserts have never merited favour at your hand, yet let me crave your furtherance in a Suite, for that I heare the Princesse is weake, and not willing to be troubled, that I may not attaine her Speech, and my businesse of importance, compelleth me to morrow early to leave the Court, to deliver this letter to her owne hands, and at your leisure returne me such answer as she please to deliver. In doing which, you shall doe me a favour of great exteeme, which shall not be bestowed on an unthankfull man. The Gentlewoman which did know where the Princesse shooe did wring her, supposing the Knight to be wounded with like affection, was glad to become so happy a Messenger, to her who could willingly vouchsafe him as partner of her best fortunes, yet making a kind deniall, she said; Sir, though I could willingly doe you more Service, then modesty will J acquaint you with, it is not the part of our Country Gentlemen, to make posts of Gentlewomen, having Pages fit for the purpose: if I refuse your request, attribute it to no discourtesie in me, which am very loath to offend her Highnesse, not knowing whither the Sentence of your paper may discontent her or no. That many Messengers have incurred displeasure, yea and losse of life as the cause hath deserved, J hope it is not unknown unto you, yet hath the harmlesse Messenger known as little what he carried, as I desirous to know of you. Sweet Syritha , qd. the Knight, that it is wisdome to beware by others harms, I denye not, yet is it discourtesie to denye the request of a Gentleman, which have ever shewed my selfe a dutifull Servant to his Highnesse, and honouring him, can I frame my heart to prejudice that Lady of incomparable vertue? No, no, Havens never permit me life, to offend her in the lest sort. Therfore doubt no such matter, for on the word of a Gentleman, my life shall be offered, and freely given, to excuse thy friendship, wherin I am so greatly pleasured by you Syritha noting by ye ofte changing color in telling his tale, his hart was not his some more businesse in his hand then he would impart, loath to offend his patience by her deniall, said; Sir perswading my selfe of your loyalty, I will for this time become your Embassador, although it should impaire my credit with her Excellence, whose favour I hold as deare as my life, and that you shall assure your selfe of my trustinesse herein, so please it you to meet me in this place to morrow, by that time the Suns power shall have drawne the dew from off the Earth, I shall returne you answer as you desire. Thanks good Syritha , for thy courtesie, assure you J will not dye in thy debt, if ever Marianus may require it by any industry. In the meane time (qd. he) favor me so highly as weare this for my sake, and pulling of a Diamond of great price gave it her, which she was loath to accept, yet giving thanks for his courtene, she said. Sir, would you did understand, I prize not my paines, that you should reward me with hire, or do you good in hope of benefit; for as it is unfitting a Gentlewoman to take gifts bestowed in such manner: so is it discourtesie and no part of a woman like condition, to refuse the gift of a friend: therefore accept my thanks, till I may better deserve it. Thus time passing away, Syritha taking her leave, departed towards the Princesse, and the Knight to his lodging, where how many sundry thoughts assailed him, I leave to them, that have endured the like.  How Syritha hasteneth to the Princesse Lodging, vnto whom after many pretty communications on both parts, she delivered the Letters, and how she obtained grace with the Princesse for her paines, with her resolution to love, and her kind acceptance of his suite.  the Princesse perceived, who was jealous of her being acquainted with her malady, who calling her to her beds side, she enquited where she had spent the time so long fro her, knowing that all her attendants were combersome unto her, but onely Syritha , with whom she might passe the time in discoursing her love. Madam, duty commands me, answer your demand, yet having been to search some daintaine that might yeeld delight to your weak stomack, and cause better disgesture, by chance prying into ye garden for such things, I was encounered by the best skild in the Dominions of Trebisond , who gave me a receit; which I judge by my simple skill, will giue your Majesty great ease; yet doth the Physitian doubt whether your stomacke will disgest it. This gracious Lady quoth Syritha , hath beene the cause of my absence, and no other. (Alas good wench) how am I beholding to thee, that caring to recover my strength, searchest the depth of thy skill, but Syritha , in vaine seekest thou her health, whom no Physitian with all his hearbs, drugs, and simples, balms, emplaisters, or what Art may provide, can remedy, onely God the great commander, must by his grace bring my desires to end, or by death end my daies of life. What Madam, ever in this tune; once alter these discords which make your musicke jar, and sing the beliefe with a cheerfull voice, so may your mind be a little eased, and the receit I have to minister, worke with the more effect: J speake this Madame, of experience, for every skilfull Physitian will prepare the body of his Patient, before he minister. Therefore Madame, if you will shake off this melancholy, you shall have a taste of what I promise, if not, your grace must pardon me, it were great pitty so precious a thing should be cast away. Well Syritha (quoth the Princesse) thou art disposed to crosse me with thy words, which doe but encrease my Disease, yeelding small comort: therefore leaving those jests, say me my good wench, if thou hast ought will doe me good (if not) use me no more thus unkindly, left overcome with the extreame or my griefe, I chance to say with my tongue, what my hart will repent, or use my hands with such rigour, as becommeth not a Maiden. The Gentlewoman seeing the wind blow so warme, fearing as much as was promised, seeing ye Princesse impatience such, thought not good to tempt her above her stregth: for women being by nature warm, with a little fewell will be made hot, past reason: wherfore making a preamble to her discourse, like an eloquent Orator, began thus. ( Marianus ) with that word, making a long pause, to note the Princesse countenance, on the suddaine naming her beloved, was interrupted thus; Marianus, Syritha , what franticke humour causeth thee to name him in this manner, with whom thou hadst never any thing to say? Madame (qd. Syritha ) attend the rest, before you either condemn me, or commend me. Then proceed, quoth the Princesse. This Marianus , of whom my Tale is before your Excellence to be told, is that Knight, who of your Majesty is called the Heroicke Champion : this Knight, as it is told me, loveth a Lady, but whom I cannot declare, before I know: but as it is told me by his deare friend which knoweth the secrets of his heart, so tormented is he in his passions, that the night naturally made for rest (restlesse) he consumeth in great discontent (the day) wherein all creatures delight, is unto him loathsome, so that through watching, and refusing his dyet, is altered from the sanguine, unto the yellow coloured Saffrone (yea Madam) these mine eyes are witnesses of it, who this day saw him passe into the Court, so feeble, that his weake Legs might hardly endure the waight of hir body. No more of this my sweet Syritha lest thy tongue busied too long on this Tragedy, overcome with the extremity of my griefe, J be enforced to seeke an end of my torments, by dispatching my owne life. Oh Syritha , is this thy comfortable confection: Is this the reliefe thou preachest off, which would yeeld me such quiet of mind? Unhappy Lady, why should I live to see another enjoy my Love? Is not Marianus my Servant, have not I made choice of him, and shall another no way worthy to enjoy him, have that interest which might delight the Goddesses? Peace Amoretta , whither comest thou? Let reason subdue rage, let reaso subdue rage, let not every one know thy love to Marianus , but conceale it as thou maist, and seeke some secret devise to give thy heart ease, by death which is thy best remedy: yet would I live to become a succour for the well deserving Knight, and gain his hearts desire for him, if I might. Cruell were that dame, and not worthy to enjoy ye simplest groome, which causelesse for love, consumeth such a man in all perfections and lineaments of body, as Marianus , without yeelding him love. But hearken Syritha , that thou maist in time when my body shall be intombed among the dead, report unto my Love (and loving Knight) how deare I held his love, as my countenance ofte shewed (though he) carelesse of loves toys never regard it, & for he shall well know at my last end how I wish his welfare, doe but this for me, by his friend to learn ye Ladies name whom the Kt. is so inthralled. This is all the Service yt I will ever command thee, that knowing her, I may become an intercessor for him, who my heart more desireth then all the worlds possession: with this, teares which trickled downe from her eyes, restrained her tongue. In wch sorrowfull passio, her Maide becam a partner,  & grieved for her folly, committing so hainous a fault in procuring the same; she excused it in this manner. Most gracious Princesse, how much I grieve to see your discomfort, J cannot say, but hope your Grace will pardon me, which have been more bold (presuming on your favour) then beseemeth me, neither what I have done (gracious Lady) was of any intent to offend you, but to acquire my selfe of blame, in a matter which I have of courtesie undertaken, as the Sequele shall manifest, if it shall please your Ladiship to peruse this Letter which will (no doubt) resolve you without further pains to me, or trouble to your Grace, what she is that is best beloved of the Heroicke Champion , on the Earth. This letter I received at his hands, who hearing of your disquiet, desirous (as it would seeme) to acknowledge his duty to you, conjured me by many faire words, and proffers of good, to deliver is unto your hands; which albeit for modesty J did long refuse, thrusting that from me with my finger, which I would willingly have drawn to me with all my force: in the end I consented, and the rather for your Ladiships quiet, which I suppose, will bid it well-come for the Masters sake; who if my judgment in the Planet Venus deceive me not, will prove shortly a conjunction, or ile never trust my skill againe; for Venus being in the signe Leo , hath dominion over both houses viz he and she, or he and you. The Princesse at her last shift, when she heard Syrithaes tale, void of all hope to enjoy her beloved Marianus , after she had a while paused, as one at length awaked from her memento , as from sleepe she saith: Now trust me wench, thou hast cunningly gone about the bush, and hast daintily sought to enter into my deepest secrets, yet how cunningly forever you have dealt, there may be a quillity to deceive both thee and him: but I pray thee Syritha , tell me what speeches used the Heroick Champion at the delivery thereof, tell me sweet Girle in friendship. The despairing Knight (good Madam) for so I must call him, how ever his valour showes it selfe in field, as no doubt worthily; so saith report: yet in love I see his dastardnesse, who loveth, yet dare not reveale the summe of his desires, but must commit it to a tell tale paper; languishing to the death, wanting his delight, and prolonging his sorrows by silence, his looks bewraying more then he can utter: for be it said, he that had seen not long since his beauty and gallant grace, the ability of his body, and noted every particular lineament, at this time with the debility thereof, should see a Metamorphasis , which might move the most hardest heart to pitty; the cause to me unknowne, but suspected. The assurance I doubt not but your Grace will soone understand, if you vouchsafe to teare the Seale and peruse the contents. The Princesse which thought every minute a yeare till she had knowledge of the Knights mind, put her Maiden from her prattle with a fained message, when being all alone, with a number of sorrowfull sighes for the Knights perplexity, she read, and many times read those lines, which gave her first comfort of enjoying her hearts content: how welcome they were unto her, it may better be imagined the explained, whose head was wholy busied in answering the same, for which she thought it not unfit to use the helpe of Syritha ; wherfore resting from her former studies, we leave her conteplating on her love, till Syritha , her return; who seeing her Ladies colour somwhat revived, began to smile, Madam (quoth she) though I made a fault in detaining so long the Physick that I promised you, yet I hope your Majesty will pardon that offence, considering the good it doth in working; how you disgest it I know not, but he that hath least skill in judging complexios, will say your marriage is mended by twenty in the hundred; if you recover but so much of your losse every two daies, there are few (in one week) will beleeve you have beene sicke. Well wanton, well (answer'd the Princesse) you have been prittily disposed to play your part, and take your pastime in beholding the folly of both our loves, which I am the more willing to forget, in that thou hast so rightly judged of both our griefes. But leaving jest, I pray thee say my sweet Syritha , what said my Servant when he delivered these letters unto thee? Madam, to say truth; nothing touching his love; but imported with such earnestnesse, for the presenting them unto your hands, as might have made many proud to do so charitable a deed, craving it with Speech so pittifull, and lookes so ruthfull: for mine owne part, my heart imagining by your affection, that the goddes which caused your grief, had fettered him, and well knowing where Love is united, the ones weale is the others good; though J were hardly won to the same, I undertooke the hazard of your good-will, promising to returne to him an answer thereof, wherein I shall breake promise, without you grant your consent. Oh Syritha , doubts thou of my consent for answering of his kind Letters, which have endured so many nights of unrest, and carefull daies for his sake? No, Heavens never grant me good in this world, if J seek not his content, and that with so good love and affection, as he offereth his love and Service to me: unkind were J else, that loving am beloved, should suffer my dearest love to languish, who may remedy it. Therefore Syritha , as thou hast plaid the Advocate, so make I thee my principall and chiefe Secretary: peruse those lines, and in right consider if that his griefe deserve not to be pittied, then let me see thy skill in enditing, to the which thou shalt have my helpe. Delay the time no longer, hunger (my Wench) is sharpe Sawce (as those say which have good stomackes) and I measuring his desires by mine own, immagine that meat cannot be more pleasing to the hungry, the the unexpected tidings of consent, from his new acknowledge Love. Soft fire, Madam (qd. Syritha ) makes the sweetest Mault, say our huswives: your Ladiship is farre wide; what, no sooner at the stile, but over, hast makes wast; looke before you leape, left a blocke unthought of, chance to breake your shins. What if these letters impart his love, how are you assured thereof? Men are subtill, and can cast many colours to deceive Women; all is not gold that glistereth, nor all Sugar that hath a sweet taste, under the greenest Grasse lurketh the poysoned Adder, ye Crocodile sheadeth most tears, when he seeketh most to deceive: try ere you trust, Madam, repentance comes too late; therefore howsoever you affect him, conceale it: Lightly wonne, is as lightly lost. The Labourer that gaineth his mony by hard labour, is more chary in parting therewith, the the purloining Thiefe, or the ryotous youth, which by subtill practises draweth all he can from his kind Parents, to maintaine his inordinate expences. Let him bite on the bridle a while, yet gently line his curbe, that he gall not (a little thing pleaseth a Child)  & a good countenance is worth gold, to him that regardeth it, as he professeth. Weigh your owne estate, which are Heire to this most famous Crown of Trebisod , with ye basenesse of his calling, which was no better than a Marchant: Consider what a corrosive this love of yours would be to your honorable Father, should he know it, and how your Nobles would stomacke him for his birth, grieving to live in obedience to one so farre their inferior. The envious regard not what vertues he is possest with, which I must needs say, deserve to be accounted: the man gaining honour by vertue and valor, is more worthy to governe the state then the Noble, which ignobleth his house by his bad demeanor. How many such there be in this Court, I grieve to see, who living licentiously, abuse themselves in such odious manner, that if your Ladiship heard the pittifull complaints of the Commons, crying out on the Prince for justice against them, and how by favour of their friends (ruling both the King  & State) they are suborned, cleared of the crime and the poore complainant, returned with a cheek, able to break the heart of a simple man: abuses which may be more lamented then easily remedied. But touching the Heroick Champion from whom I have digrest, I speake not any thing to disparage his love, nor to draw your liking from the Knight, but wish you temper your affection in such sort, yt you may long enjoy it, with content to you both, and so governe your Graces looks and countenances, that ye lightnesse of the one, nor the liberall bestowing of the other, give jealous heads any cause of suspition. For Princes are great marks, and have many Eyes beholding them and once perceived, what perill it may procure to either part, your wisdome can conceive. Thus in duty have I spoken, and delivered a grosse advise, which J refer to your Graces better consideration. Well hast thou said, my Syritha , qd. the Princesse, but what availeth counsel to a desperat mind? No more the he yt seeks to quech ye flame powreth Oyle to it. J find thy love so great towards me, that J cannot requite it, which with such good regard balanceth each perill incident to both our states, if thou canst as well devise how we may enjoy our delight, without which we perplexed cannot long endure, what is it that Amoretta shall ever enjoy, but Syritha shall command? Then as thou tendrest my good, bethinke thee of some remedy, for my love to him is such, as nothing may extinguish. Say my sweet Syritha , shall I by writing answer his Letters, or no? In this I will be ruled by thee, how gladly soever I wish his comfort, in whom, of all Earthly creatures, consisteth my most comfort. Experience is the best wisdome (qd. Syritha ) who would ever have beleeved Loves power to be of such effect, how imperious soever he seemed, had they not seene and heard what I doe; through which I am compelled to recant my heresie, and say Love is a god, or how is it possible he could command Princes? But to your Graces request, wheras you have referred the answer of Marianus letters to me, I was never so void of reason, nor so desirous to be counsellour to your Excellence, to take so great a matter upon me, yet shall I (if so please it you to hear me) deliver my simple opinion, as I wold doe my selfe in the like action. The old Wives say, they that feed with the Divell must have a long spoone; and they that goe about to master Love, had need of many good precepts: disswade your Grace J will not to forget it, for I see it is vaine, neither would I wish you to answer by writing; for a paper is soon lost, and lost, to whose finding it shall come, t'is uncertaine; as soon to some envious Enemy, as a wel-willer, in which some word simply meant of you or me, may be construed by them at their pleasure, whereby your name may be brought in question; and a slander raised, is not so easily suppressed; writing is a specialty, whereof the subtill Lawyer takes no small advantage: to avoid all which casualties, this may you doe; pretend some matter of conference with him,  & appoint the time when he shall attend your pleasure at your Lodging, comming secretly unto you, & at such time as the King your Father shall be imployed in serious affaires, so may you use your Speech at your pleasure. This would Syritha doe, your Grace may use your discretion. J like thy devise well (good Wench) and give thee many thanks (quoth the Princesse) therfore faile not to meet him for thy promise, what else I refer to thy best judgment. Now in faith Madam (qd. Syritha ) you have made a good choice for a Soliciter, but take me as I am, this is the first Suite that ever I was retained for: nor I doubt not (if I speed well now) of many Clients. As they were thus pleasat between themselves, they heard a Trumpet sound to horse, which caused the Princesse to send her Page to enquire the cause, who returned her answer, that the King with his traine, were setting forward to hunt a wild Bore, which his Forrester had rowsed: This newes gave them cause of joy, hoping that Fortune favoured them with a happy time, which they were both loath to omit, doubting the like opportunity; the Princesse especially, who could not be quieted in mind, untill she heard her Knight answer for himselfe: Wherfore a Page was presently commanded to search for the Knight, willing him with such covenient speed as he could to meet Syritha in the Garden; the Page used such diligence, that soon he was brought unto the Knights presence, whom he found solitary (as a holy Father) at his Orizons, whom the Page awaked with his joyfull message, which was welcome unto him, albeit doubtfull (whether of weale or woe) either to augment his Sorrowes, or utterly to extinguish them. The sudden hearing of which, caused him to pause a while, when having determined, courteously returned answer to the Gentlewoman, that he would attend her, he rewarded the Page so bountifully, as he had cause to boast him of his well imployed Service. Syritha having received his answer by the Page, advertized the Princesse thereof, who commanded her to haste, lest she gave the Knight cause of discontent by her long stay: but for all her speed Marianus was long there before, attending her comming: who was no sooner of him perceived to enter the place, but his heart presaging some good, was more delighted thereat, then all the motions that could be imagined, after his courteous salutations done, thus said:  How Loves Heroicke Champion was brought to the Princesse presence by Siritha , then loves being discovered, a consent was of both parties agreed vpon to love. The Knight discovereth himselfe to the Princesse: vnto whom he vnfoldeth all his love, with the originall proceedings.  willing to be resolved, as one than by thy answer expecteth his doome, either of life or death. I attend thy pleasure: say therfore sweet Lady, what saith the Princesse to my Letters? with whom Syritha purposed to be somthing pleasant, and not to cloy his stomack with such pleasant confectios, that he should surfet therwith, and framing a countenance to her Speech, she said. Sir Knight, of all the Gentlemen in the Court of Trebisond , my good opinio was such of you, that on your word, I durst have hazarded my greatest credit, which expectation thou hast far deceived, and therefore not worthy to be accounted amongst such honourable men at Arms, which take their principall honour, holding their words with Gentlewomen. At the delivery of which Speech he that had tooke regard to the Knights countenance, might have thought him past Physicks recure: And withall standing so mute, it verily perswaded Syritha , that he was ready to deliver his interest of life, which made her alter her tough words, and with a smoother methode new file them; doubting that her Comedy begun in mirth, should prove a Tragedy, to the great griefe of ye whole Country, which generally honoured him, Wherfore taking him by the hand, she said, Sir Knight, I am sorry J have charged you so farre, what cause soever J had, but t'is womanlike to be slain with words, and no fit passion for a man of your profession. That you may comfort your selfe, I first pardon the offence against me committed (and enjoin you) as you tender your credit with the Princesse Amoretta , that you faile not to repaire at such convenient time as you best can, unto her Lodging; where if you hold your word, you will excuse your Messenger. Oh Syritha , how have thy Speeches tormented me, filling my Entrails with such a confusion of cofortlesse thoughts as have overcome my Sences? Yet Syritha , if thou be courteous, or have any spark of Gentility abide in thee: Say my good Lady, what countenance gave the Princesse to my bashfull paper? Vouchsafed she the reading of them? (Or how) to discomfort you good Kt (qd. Syritha ) it were pitty, being already at so low a Datum , which pittieth me to behold. Cofort can I give none to thy desire but this, thy Sute is Love, as your Letters import, in which despaire not: for thy Mistresse is a wom. though a Princesse, and how pittifull our Sexe is, I will not boast but wish thee not despaire; If thy Birth were as great as thy vertus, thou mightst boord and bed, as good as the Princesse Amo. unto who I will be a faithfull Solliciter. Mistake me not Marianus , I speak as a friend,  & so leave thee, untill thy coming to my Lady, which detract not, for time lost is such a precious thing, as can never be recalled. Before who, whe thou shalt come, plead thine own cause, & discover thine own griefe. And so farewell. Marianus , which had some greater hope by Syritha , her last Speeches, was so over joyed, that he could not bid her farewell: yet after his Memento past, he saith: farewell the faithfullest friend in my distresse, that over J found. Oh Syritha , happy maist thou be in thy loves, and highly honoured amongst men, by whom my cares are thus comforted (faithfull Syritha ) the worker of my harts happy content, by whom past all hope, I am by thy faithfulnesse  & truth in delivering my message, freed of so heavy a burthen, as was likely to have torne my poore oppressed heart in a million of pieces. Thus applauding Syritha , he had almost forgotten his word. Leaving further to discant on this plain song, returne we to the Princesse, who was advertised by her Gentlew: what had passed between the Knight  & her, not omitting his heavy lookes, and pittifull Speeches. And then againe, as glad to please the Princesse, whom she was assured loved the Knight, letted not at large to set out his honours gained, his comelinesse of person, bounty, and whatsoever the world admired in him, she highly advanced: to the great content of the Princesse, who thought every moneth a yeare untill she saw him, whom she with harty desire expected (long looked for, comes at last.) And Amoretta , who at a casement waited diligently his comming, espied her beloved Knight, what joy it caused, let them judge, which better experience hath made perfit in Lovers delights. The Princesse having the sight of her so log desired Knight, sent Syritha to entertain him, and to bring him to her presence, The Princesse studying to frame her countenace for his welcome, bethought herselfe of sundry means, eftsoons, doubting by her too pleasant  & kind usage, to be thought too forward in love, the what discomfort her heavy looks might move to him, whom she most desired to please. In this quandary, sitting on a Pallet, leaning her head on her pillow, Syritha hath brought the Knight to her presence, who doing his duty was by the Princesse againe saluted. Attending like the guilty condemned, his Sentence from her mouth, which was to give him either life or death, the Knight thus at a non-plus overcome with the beholding of the Princesse excellent perfection, was by her the mirror of all honour and courtesie, removed out of his dumps, in this manner. Sir Marianus , whither I should chastice thy presumptio in writing so boldly unto me (or no) J am not yet resolved, but before I acquainte my Father therwith, J thought good to heare thee speak, for that J would not suddainly disgrace thee, whom I have so often graced: as well to heare thy intent committing so great a folly, as what you can say in excuse therof. Princes are not to be jested with, nor to be attempted in such manner by their inferiours, and therefore thou hast highly erred in that thou hast done, and incurred the danger of our strictest lawes, by which thou art already condened, were thy fact known. The Knight standing at the bar, where Beauty sat chiefe Judge, was surprized with so many griefs, that he might hardly utter any word, yet revived by hope of those comfortable and sweet words pronounced by Syritha , he saith: Gracious Lady, that I have presumed far, I cannot but acknowledge, yet that I have encurred such punishment as your Highnesse inferreth, I deny, unlesse death be the guerdon assigned for the falthfull (for dutifull Service) and intire affection, urged me to seek thy favour in love, without which I may not live: so deeply are thy vertuous perfections imprinted in my heart, which if I enjoy not, I desire no longer to breath. Therfore Madam, if thou disdaine his love, that living dieth continually for thee; do but say the word, and this blade so often imbrued in the bloud of mine Enemies, shall sacrifice his Masters owne true hart before thy face, that thy cruell selfe (maist witnesse to thy selfe) how faithfully thy Servant hath loved thee. The Princesse grieved to heare these Speeches, moved with great ruth, could hardly forbeare shedding of teares, yet modesty the ornament of womankind, caused her to fein a counterfeit shew of displeasure to him, whose tears wroong drops of bloud from her tender hart: yet that she might not so suddenly confesse her harts desire, nor give him cause of utter despaire, she saith; Marianus , that thou maist see and seeing, report in all places, where ever thou shalt be come of Womens pitty, I grant thee pardon for thy fault, and with my pardon, thy life, which was wholy in me to dispose. For loving me as thy Prince I hartily thank thee, but in seeking to obtain my love, as thy wife, that have beene denied to divers and sundry Princes, in that thou errest, let each estate frame themselves in love, to their equals, so shall they sooner obtaine their desires; and their loves in more tranquillity be maintained. Thou knowest thy birth how Base it is,  & though for thy vertues it pleased my Princely Father to advance thee, who cannot of his Princely nature, but reward the deserts of the well deserving: If for his good to thee, thou seek to rob him of his Child, therein thou shewest a very ungratefull mind, and layest open unto the world thy base condition. Therfore persist to prosecute thy Sute, lest reason vanquish that brain-sick humor which so afflicts thee; in doing which, thou shalt shew thy love to be thy selfe: For no greater conquest can be atchieved, then conquering a mans owne effects. Doe this, & thou shalt find Amoretta thy faithfull  & assured friend, who will be as carefull to advance thee, as I have found thee ready to pleasure me. Alas good Madam (answer'd ye Knight) I have often heard, the whole needs no Physitian, it is easier far to give counsell then to take it. The full gorged Churle little regardeth the starving creature at his gate, but (Madam) could you conceive the lest part of many thousand griefes that afflict me, you would pitty me at lest, though you yeelded me no farther favour: If thy heart be not harder then the Adamant (pitty me) sweet Lady, and yeeld thy grace to augment my life, or utterly denie me your favor for ever. I expect but your answer for my resolution is no other then I have profest (dastards feare to die) but the noble mind preferreth death which endeth all sorrows, before a life to be continued with discontent. The Princesse, which was at her wits end, as full of griefe as he of Sorrow, turned her Speeches from her matter, to question him of his Country, the manner of the Court, and state thereof, thinking so to have beguild the time, and put him off for that season, But so long dallied she, that she was forced in the end, to confesse her love to be no way inferiour to his. Thus as I have said, demanding of the Knight many questions, she earnestly intreated him to resolve her whether the Prince Armatius , were such as the world reported him: who had name to be a Paragon, excelling in all actions required in a Noble man. The Prince hearing his name called in question by the Princesse, on a suddain, beleeved verily that she had some secret knowledge of him, which made him with blushing cheeks to say. What reports soever your Grace hath heard of that Prince Armatius , I know not: a Subject J was to his Father, and ought to speake reverently of him (yet what is truth) and not for affection or despight, to say other then I will with my blood avouch. Wherefore Noble Lady, I will truly answer your demands. The Prince, whose Father was matchlesse, gaining the love of all men, with care and honour maintained the reputation of his Country, which by his carelesse Son is blemished, who neglecting the duty of a Child, without regard of Father, Crown, or Kingdome, exiled himselfe, no man knowes where, or whether he rest alive or no: since which time, the King his Father, who loved him too deare (if Fathers love may be too deare) hath likewise absented himselfe, and liveth in exile. The Mother Queen, hath resigned her due to death, leaving (by losse of those honourable persons) their Country without a head, and their State by Subjects to be governed, wherby a ruine of the Kingdom is like to ensue, all proceeding from the Prince. A miserable country is yt (qd. the Princesse)  & to be lamented; but more ye losse of so noble a race, ye Father having bin such, and the Son as (report saith) so toward. But say (good Knight) qd. she, was there never any cause supposed of their departures; nor did not ye Father through his harsh demeanor, for youth in these times take unkindly their Fathers unkindnesse: and Age is froward, wch frowardnesse might minister great cause of discontet. Madam (qd. the Kt.) to my knowledge, this I will say, my Father being a Courtier in some regard, wherby J came familiar with ye Prince, and as youth will make choise of someone to participate with, so it pleased the Prince loving my Father well, to use my copany in all his exercises, through which I saw his demeanour, with such reverent duty to the King acknowledged, and as kindly requited of the King, as on the earth might be found love more perfect till his Speech fayling in his mouth, he could utter no more. The Princesse giving heed to each word by him pronounced, albeit she saw the repeating of the Princes life, was somwhat cumbersom unto him, yet ceased he not to urge him, to shew such Sorrow in delivering the story so of her desired. Ah Madam (qd. the Knight) at his departure began our Countries griefe and my sorrow, from whom in life, I could never be separated, such was my love to him, which refused himselfe, his Crown, and dignities. A dolefull tale hast thou delivered (quoth the Princesse) which I perceive moveth you to impatience, wherfore, one demand and an end. The Prince Armatius , made choise of you, for his companion: Then under benedicity let me crave (all law of friendship exempted) did he not acquaint you with his determinations? for me thinks it is scant credible, yt such an unity should be amongst men, their loves being so perfect, but he should disclose each secret intent whatsoever: many reasons draweth me to suppose it, which I will omit, for I perceive I am too tedious. Your Ladiship urgeth me farre, yet will J accomplish your request, who have power to command me. The Gentleman who never offended, but in committing of this great offence, long before his departure, having be like some motion of desire in his thoughts, became of a pleasant Gentleman, the most melancholiest that could be found, that quite abolishing all company, he best contented himselfe with his secret cogitations; continuing this honour so long, that he fell sicke of an extreame fever: which so encreased upon him, as all Physickes reliefe was quite given over: so that small was the hope of his recovery, whose distresse, the kind King, with the Mother Queen, grieved in such wise to behold, as in short time it was hard to be judged which of the three endured most extreams. But God that in adversity sends comfort, restored the Prince to some strength: belike receiving some comfort in his imaginations, and by his recovery, ye King and Queen were both so comforted, as in short time they were raised from their sick Cabinets, to frolike it amongst their noble subjects, who joyed in nothing so much as in their healths. But how soone the Sun-shine of their happinesse was overshadowed with clouds of comfortlesse care, grieveth me to recount; yet dare I not gain say your Ladiships request. The Prince recovered of his malady, made semblance of such content, that none but himselfe could witnesse by the least suspition, his hearts discontent, yet oftentimes should I, being seldom from his company, sighing with a number of farre fetched sobs, heare him say, Peerlesse Lady, would my love were as well known to thee as to mine own hart, the doubtlesse wouldst thou pitty me who languish for thee, that art the onely Princesse on the earth, Excelling in all vertues which beauty the honorable; the report of which hath fettered my fancies to thee, that I protest to be thine; or never mine owne: then looking with a gastly looke about him, to see if any overheard him, he would fall into some other discourse, ever applauding the rare perfections of his Mistresse who was unknowne to all but only to himselfe, and I, who from the first he acquainted with the same: briefly Lady (for I weary you with my discourse) the love of his Lady hath drawne him from his Country, whose absence caused the Kings exile, and the Kings exile the Queens death. The Princesse hearing all these extreams to grow from affection, knowing well her owne hearts discontent, with a sigh from the deepest, which wrung teares from her heart, she said; Alas noble Gentleman, whose joy so soon overwhelmed, hath heaped so many cares upon me, what folly was there in thee, ye wouldst not disclose thy love which burn'd so vehemetly: was ye dame so base that thou fearest therby to ignoble thy issue, or of such high estate thou doubtest to obtaine her; if either, by perswasions all griefs might have bin mittigated of a Monarch, why thou by report deservest her; if a Beggar: thou mightst make her noble, what ere she were hearing of thy distresse, could she forbeare to pitty thee? No, no, were her hart more harder then the Diamond, it could not chuse at the hearing thereof, but relent: else, well worthy were she to be scorned of all Ladies, and never to be named amongst the number of women. The Prince seeing the Princesse in this pittifull humour, thought it good striking when the iron was hot, and taking the opportunity, answer'd her thus: Is your Ladiships censure such of hard-hearted Ladies, and will not be intreated of him, whose love to you, is no whit inferiour to the Prince Armatius , as himselfe would confesse were he present, and heard me recount the many griefes, wherewith love hath afflicted me: and might he be Iudge, would allow me recompence for my Service in love. But Madam, if without offence I might demand this; say Amoretta , the Princesse of Trebisond were the Saint, unto who this unhappy Prince had vowed his devotions,  & that all the passions he hath endured, are for your love, would you vouchsafe him love in recompence thereof? The Princesse driven to her shifts at this demand, could not tell what to answer yet sharpning her wits (as women can doe) she said: Marianus , Love is not to be dallied with, as I have heard them say, which speak by experience; therefore I cannot directly answer thy question, but were I the Physitian that could cure his malady, and had so good judgment of his affects as of mine owne, charity would I should minister unto his Disease, what effect soever the potion would worke? provided this, that he disclosed his griefe in time: mistake me not Marianus , and pardon me if I conceale what I would utter my thoughts are mine own. Truth Lady (qd. the Knight) neither was the same demanded to urge any thing more then standeth with your good liking: yet for the Prince, this I say, it were pitty he should die for love. So say J (qd. the Princesse) for few men there be of that condition, and as seldome is such a one seen, as multitude of blacke Swans. Your error is great, Madam (qd. the Knight) for many have beene with love, so overcome, that Kings have bin enforced to stoope to their Subjects, and the greatest Conquerours, whose valour many volumes record, by love compelled to forsake themselves, taking sundry shapes and many toyles, to gaine the love of their Ladies. I speak now, Madam, for the Prince, whom I love well, and challenge your charity may be to him continued, for your love is the only Physick that must cure him, or else all other helpes are frivolous: in hope whereof, he breaths a lingring life till your gracious consent finish his griefes, yeelding to his desires in whom it resteth, to restore him banished to his regall dignities, who is the cause of his exile: dastardnesse hath caused him to conceale it, bearing the extremity of his passions with intolerable pain, whose flames encaease by viewing your excellent perfections; The want of whose grace, haleth him on to desperatio, not able any longer to resist Loves assaults, which with such hot Alarumes assaile him, that longer he cannot endure them. The Princesse hearing her Knight plead for the Prince with such earnestnesse, leaving his own Sute, to draw her to love him of whom her thoughts were least on, thought it some policy of the Knight, which imagined Love had vanquished her, swelling with anger at these new imaginations, her colour changed into so many formes, ye the least Child which had seen ye same, might easily have gestwhat smal content those last uttered Speeches wrought. But doubting lestwith silence it should be perceived, with a heart full fraught with fury, she said; Deceitfull wretch, unworthy ye favor of ye simplest druge, that by thy subtill practises hast sought to insinuat thy selfe into my secrets, was it not, false varlet, sufficiet yt I forbeare the punishing of thy own bold writings; but to my face in colourable deludest me with Tales of I know not what. Have J ever graced thee since I first saw thee, and requitest thou my favor thus, dallying with me as with thy inferiour, or some of thy base Trulles? No, no, use thy jest with such that can better disgest them,  & from henceforth be warned (and warned) take heed how thou dare either by word or writing, use any like motions, lest I acquaint the World with thy impotent dealings, and by death thou receive the guerdon of thy ill: and so far as thou maist, for never expect farther favour at my hands. The Prince hearing this finitive Sentence, from her, whose tongue was to pronounce his life or death, thought it high-time to speak for himself before she departed, and staying her as she would have gone, he humbly besought her, not in displeasure to leave him, but with patience endure what he could say: which albeit she might hardly be won to grant, yet her former affection banished chollor in such wise, that he had liberty to speake, saying. Gracious Lady, that I offended your Excellence, whom of all Earthly creatures I most honour, I hartily sorrow for it, judge me not so impudent or sencelesse, to move matter without some reason, especially enduced thereunto by your excellent favour, and charitable pitty of the wretched estate of that unhappy Prince, who hath vowed to love your Grace to the death; and by granting him your love, you shall draw him from death, and therby not only restore him, but still the hearts of many thousands with joy, which with teares continually lamenteth his losse, which is lost to them for ever, and shortly will be losse to himselfe & the whole world. Vnhappy Prince, why name I him Prince, whose miseries is more then the most wretched slave that liveth, who not able to endure ye force of love, hath forsaken himselfe, to follow his owne affections, without knowledg of Father, King, or Subjects. Muse not Madam, at the strangnesse of the Tale I have to deliver, nor let it seeme incredible, that J am that unhappy Armatius ; lawfull Heire of the Carmanian Crown, that Prince, through who so many miseries is befallen his country, his Fathers care, and cause of his carefull Mothers untimely death, who fettered in Loves hands, by report of thy peerlesse beauty and vertues, hath drawn me to take habit of a Marchant, usurping the name of Marianus , the more unsuspected to attaine the sight of thee whom my hart so desired: who, if thou pitty me, live by thy love to doe thee honour, and without thee, may no longer enjoy this life; in pursuit of whose love, if I die, my Ghost among the rest of Lovers shall sing hynnes in land of thy peerlesse beauty. The Princesse as one in a trance, could not tell whether she heard him speak or dreamed, yet noteing his countenance which shewed a troubled Spirit, tickled with a suddain joy, as women be proud in their Loves, that her love to Marianus , was metamorphosed to Armatius the Carmanian Prince, of whom her Fathers Courtiers reported such honours, she said; Marianus , or how I shall call thee I know not, thou hast filled my Senses with a world of confused thoughts, in recounting the strangenesse of thy fortunes, which J can hardly be drawn to beleeve, nor is it possible that the Prince Armatius could live in ye Court of Trebisond , so long concealed, without knowledge of some one, if J might by reason be induced to beleeve ye same J would say more. Madam qd. the Prince howsoever I have disguised my selfe heretofore, as loath to be dishonoured, yet beleeve me in this, that I said no more then is truth. Therefore if thou couldst not love Marianus being a Marchant, for ignobling thy noble house, yet as J am Prince of Carmania , vouchsafe me thy liking, by whom thy honor can no way be disparaged, but by exchanging love for love with him, advance thy honor farre higher. Say now Madam, all nicenesse set apart can you love? The Princesse, whose love was equall though willingly she would have colored the same, yet moved with a pittifull desire to ease his griefe, which far surpassed, as also to ease her owne heart which was not a little infected with the same Disease, their welfares depending both on her grant or deniall. After she had deliberated a while, fixing her hand in his, which she easily grasped, and leaning her head on his shoulder to cover the blushing of her Face, as ashamed of what she had to say unto him, in revealing her owne griefe, she said. Famous Prince, whom the world applaudeth, and our Courtiers of Trebisond , with wonder to admire, that I loved thee being Marianus , I cannot denye, and how many jarres I endured for thee, I omit: each particular, wringing tears from my hart, which how willing soever it was to have made the same knowne, modesty restrained, laying before me many wrongs offered in Ladies love, by such perjured Knights, as have protest with their tongues which their hearts never ment, wherby divers Ladies of honor have beene dishonoured, and sundry lost their lives (which considered) blame me not, if I rather chuse to dye, then passe the bands of modesty so far, as seek thy love, or knowing thy griefe, to blame mine (yeeld) before I heard thee avow on thine honour, what thy letters imported. But gentle Prince, that thou maist better beleeve what I report, how much soever my heart hath denied to reveale perswade thee, if I loved thee being Marianus , and a counterfeit Marchant, assure you, I cannot hate thee for that thou art Armatius , (the one a Prince) the other an inferior, of whose love were I assured, and that his tongue and hart agreed in one, Armatius , should be in love so requited, as never any should have interest in Amorettaes heart, but the peerlesse Prince of Carmania . At uttering of which, tears restrained her Speech, which the Prince noted, and perceiving that she spake what her heart thought, he comforted her thus. Faint not Madam, neither sorrow for those comfortable confections bestowed on a dying creature, whose favours hath haled him from the grave, wherevnto he was like to have bin swallowed, had not thy comfort reclaimed me, who living, dyed for thy love, which grace shall never be forgotten. And yt you shall assure you, my faith and love is firme and honourable, I protest by that honour that ever the Carmanian Prince hath regarded, that my love to the Princesse Amoretta , is no other but honorable, nor ever none hath had any interest in Armatius , or ever shall, but the onely beautifull, and vertuous Princesse Amoretta : and on that, take here my hand, and with my hand, the heart, love, and honour of a Prince. Syritha , lending an eare to this prattle, hearing them so earnest, to put them from their melancholy, tooke the word at advantage, and comming suddenly to the, said; Madam, at finishing of bargaines, they shake hands, if there be any exchange between your Knight and you, you were best to take witnesse, lest disliking the match, he recant his word. Syritha (qd. the Prince) your Lady is beholding to thee for thy care (and I) your debter, challenge it when you please. Sir (qd. Syritha ) I thank you, but wilt please you remeber your promise, and excuse Syritha (qd. the Princesse) without my Lord the Prince his further intreaty, I pardon all faults committed against me, for confirmation of which, get our Lawyer to draw an acquittance generall from the beginning of the world, and I will signe it. Nay Madam (answered Syritha ) it were an evill Servant that will not take her Mistresse word for a dozen or two of stripes, which J am sure had beene the most, and if they should light on my ribs, might well grieve me, slay me they could not, my heart is of more valour then so. But Madam, shall Sir Marianus marry the Princesse Amoretta , that you call him your Lord the Prince? if that be the bargaine, I feare me there is some fire in the straw. And how then (qd. the Princesse?) Nay Madam (qd. Syritha ) nothing, but I pray God give you much joy, and make you happy in your love. While they were thus pleasant, a Page brought word that divers Ladies were come to visit the Princesse, which caused them, how loath soever, after many sweet imbracings and loving kisses, betweene them enterchanged, to give each other the farewell, parting better content the they came together, having unburthened their harts of many griefes, giving content to both, by yeelding to Love, which vanquished both, whom to their pleasing imaginations I leave, to recount the Kings of Trebisond and Hungary , their pastimes in hunting.  How the Kings of Trebisond and Hungary , hunted with great delight, and what hapned them, with a pleasant discourse of a simple Country-man, whom with his Mother, the two Kings by chance met withall, with the letters of the Clowne to his love, and complaint of his Mother of wrongs done her by a man of estate.  greatly delighted were so wearied with the same,  & toyled with the extremity of heat, which made them choose some place under ye shadow of the spreading trees to refresh themselves, where they had not long rested, but they were espied of an ancient woman, the widow of a good Yeoman, and her Son, who having workmen not far from thence, were carrying the victuals. The poore aged woman having seen (as she thought unseen) the Kings doubting they were some of those robbers, that hanted those Mountains, wold have shifted from them another way, but were interrupted of the Kings, who suddenly calling them, drave the both into such shaking feare, as they which are overburthened with a Feaver. The King who graciously regarded their timorousnesse, comforted them with all the favourable Speeches he could use, protesting unto them, that in their company they should receive no discourtesie, by none, if the King himselfe were present, and therfore willed them to set feare apart, and to tell them what they were, the cause of their feare, and their businesse they had that way? These honourable speeches of the King mildly uttered, comforted them, wherefore in such blunt manner as her bringing up required, she said; Gentlemen, for so you seeme, if your inward conditions answer your outward habit (as many in this Age doth) whose garments might become men of great worth, if apparell may make a man worthy, yet divers times cover those Carkases, void either of worship, honesty, or other good condition. Pardon my harsh behaviour (gentle Sir) and blame me not for avoiding the way, experiece hath taught me to eschew harms, who to my cost have dearly paid for my learning, having my goods spoiled at home, and my selfe indangered abroad: and without offence may I speake it, by such, whose countenance and attire, might well have deceived them of more judgment then my selfe. The King delighted wiih her plain Speeches, demanded where she dwelled, and whether she had a husband, or lived as a Widow? Oh Sir, if any Gentilnesse abide in you (qd. she) urge me not to deliver a tale of such ruth, as your questions import. The remembrance of my passed pleasant life, when I call to mind, with the cares I am now combred with, many sundry wayes, are so displeasing unto my grieved heart, as I may not without many teares shed, recount the same. These words spoken in heavinesse noted of the King, made him more importunate to heare the rest, and therfore willed her, all feare set apart, to reveale unto him, what estate she lived in, and if any wrongs were offered her, he protested by Oathes which might have bin well beleeved, to remedy it, yea, if it were the King himselfe. The carefull Widow encouraged by these comfortable words, albeit she hoped of small reliefe from him, partly to ease her hart, & a little to disgrace her adversary, which was mighty, all ye reveng she could take thus said: Sir, that I may not seeme discourteous to you, whose courtesie offered, is more the I can any way deserve, but in prayer for your welfare, which pittieth a poore Widdows estate, whose weale is ye good of her poore fatherlesse Orphats, hearwith pitty my case, cosider thereof, as you shall best please. Then drying her eyes, which like gutters bedewed her cheeks, she said. Not far from hence (gentle Sir) is my poore Cabinet, where this fifty winters I have maintained the port of a poore woman, my Husband in his life delighting in Hospitality, and on his Death-bed, gave me charge to doe the like, which I have observed, hurting none, nor never denying any good to them that sought to me; The needy J harbored, whom with my bread and such Viands as God sent, I have fed. But now Sir (qd. she) and therewithall, a deepe sigh witnesse of her hearts heavinesse, restrained her speeches, yet after some pause, said; But now Sir; such is the oppression of the covetous in authority, that my living is taken from me, and I with my Family, compelled to seeke harbour where we can get it, if God the comfort of the distressed, provide not within three moneths for us, longer we have not there to abide. Tell me woman (qd. the King) what is he that thus injureth thee, and the manner how? and as I am a true Subject to the King, J will never leave thee till thou art with justice revenged on him. Oh Sir (quoth she) urge me no more to that, for my adversary being honourable and of account with the King although the wrong I sustaine is great, yet will he revenge himselfe on me and mine, as my life will be the least and last, such is his bloody mind, who hath neither conscience, nor thought of any good, else after so many yeares of peaceable possession of this Tennement, in name of my Husbands Ancestry, as our evidence doth specifie, he would not thus extreamly deale with those whom charity would he should comfort; but such is his cruelty, who sought to be courteous, that his covetousnesse is never satisfied, haling all from the poore, and profiting none, but himselfe, his Children, or Servants, who reape the benefit of many mens labors, for what Suite passeth, but he must like of? Or what will the King deny, but he will grant? Lamentable is it to heare the complaints of the Commons, of all estates, how in secret they murmure: Nay, not onely against him, but I may say, by others reports, that the Kings name is called in question of many, all proceeding of this canker of men, who guiding all, abuse all. The Souldier serving for his Countries honour wanteth his pay, which causeth him fall to robbery, and other unlawful exercises. The Farmer, Grasier, and such, that live by the benefit of their Tillage, feeding Cattell, and other hard labours, have their Cattell taken, their Corne, and what they enjoy, and driven to seeke their mony by long Sutes, and in the end glad to bestow the one halfe to be assured of the other, yet dare none complaine, how great soever the oppression be. Thus Sir, to satisfie you, I have spoken the truth what I have heard, and partly that I know, which I and many more may lament, but cannot remedy it. But Sir, what I have spoken, J hope you will conceale, for if you be friend to him, whom I dare not name, yet you can imagine: If under your faire words lurk deceit, and that you have sifted me to betray me to his cruelty, such ill befall thee, as I wish him, whom I have cause to curse, and others with me, whom he hath likewise wronged. But had the King knowledge how he useth his Subjects, especially his Tenants (who is our good Landlord) and thus many years hath been, he would redresse it; but that he having the charg of all, hath received a great fine to thrust me from my right, which God remedy and grant our King to understand his Tyranny. Amen (quoth the King ) May it be possible that he (whom I know) the King hath loved so deere, and advanced to such honour, should seek his dishonour in so base manner? Well good woman (qd. the King ) that thou shalt know I favour thy cause, and sorrow for the wrongs offered the Commons, I will informe the King what I have heard, and thou shalt have justice, else never let me live. Therefore see ye three dayes hence thou faile not to come to the Court, unto ye Kings Porter deliver this Signet , who upo sight therof shall bring thee to my presence, in the meane time, comfort thy selfe, and faile not to meet me at the appointed time. The aged Widdow, whose heart Sorrow and feare had over-burthened, doubtfull lest her large Speeches should have caused her greater trouble, was by the King comforted, whom she had no knowledge of, yet prayed God to preserve him, in peace and much happinesse, and so would have departed. But the King melancholy at these reports willed her to stay, for that he would have some Speech with her Son which seemed very simple, shewing by his demeanour how he had bin brought up. Wherefore to delight him, and to drive those melancholy dumps away, he questioned him of his years and bringing up, and how he lived, whither a Batchelor, or married; which questios, were answer'd with such simplenesse, as greatly delighted the King. As the Kings were thus pleasantly discoursing with him, it fortuned the King of Trebisond to espy a paper in his bosome, which, for he seemed by his Inckhorne at his girdle, to be a Clark, perswaded themselves, that if it were not some reckoning or remembrance, it was some worthy worke, which made the King require a sight thereof, which how loath soever he seemed, making often denials, it might not be accepted: after many perswasions, he pulled the same out, which was folded in the curiousest manner, carer, cornered, and subscribed. Why how now friend: this is suspitious, that in such secret manner (quoth the King) you carry Letters, refusing to shew them, when they are required? it may be treason against ye state, therefore I will by your leave see it. Oh Gentleman (qd. the yongling) in his clownish manner, if you can, I pray you let it alone, or at least, if you read it, let not my Mother heare. For my life (qd. the King) it is some sound stuffe, and matter worth the sport, wherefore tearing the Seale, which was as broad as a shilling, of the best blacke waxe the Cobler would bestow on him, they read the Contents thus:  thee. sold for 18. pence the quart, of thy honesty being little, I say little, good Ale needs no signe, for such are thy vertues, that they shine over the whole Parish, like the Moone in her Eclipse: Cupine , J applaud thy dignities, by whose power my heert hath sworne love in a fraile to thee, for which good turne, and that thou shalt the rather further my love, I vow every Christmas day during the Lease of my life, to carry to thy Chappell, two halfe-penny white loaves, and a pot of the best Ale, with the appurtenances, and to verifie my word to thee, I sweare by my Loves hand, so white as the boulted Rye loafe, never to faile, if it cost me a faire great of silver: in recompence of which, as thou art a God, thou wilt cause Mopsa , who like sneaking Wench hath stollen my heart to joyn issue with me, and love me with so good a zeale as I love her, which I may sweetly say, yea, and sweare it too, is with so good a heart as ere I plaid the Trevant from Schoole. Oh Mopsa , Be it knowne vnto thee by these presents, the enditement of my heart roote, and the superscription of my shaking hand, that thou art the onely joy and delight of thy loving Hobbinot , who plungeth like a Pack horse in the Mire over head and cares for thee, sowcing to the gulphe of hearts griefe, as a Sowes face in the Bryne Tub: Yea, like as fire in the Brewers fornace I burne, and all for thee. O Mopsa ; as thou art hansome and well-favoured, so be thou pittifull, and pull a handfull of cold love from thy heart; to quench the flame, which like the great Hill that burneth consumeth me, so much that as many as come within smell of me; stopping their noses for feare of infection, with a troubled voice say; Fye on the filthy wretch, the cause of it: Thy love my deare, is the onely cause; Thou art my Iewell, my Pearle, my Dyamond, without thy love, nothing can be pleasing vnto Hobbinot , by yeelding ther of a grant with consent and good liking, thou vnburthenest my heart of sorrow, as one should vnrig a ship, but if thou deny, bestowing the same on some Clowne, my feriour, and nothing worthy to enjoy thee so Marmelade a Lasse, my branding blade shall broach my side in such manner, that my puddings for saking their habitation, my belly shall be no more desirous of the good White-pot and Bacon, wherewith it hath beene so often filled. If thou be pittifull Mopsa ? save the life of a loving Batcheler, and suddainly let me know thy mind, or else farewell to thee, farewell to the world, yea; Adue to all the brave lusty gallant Youths of our Parish: to whom so often I have led the Morish, to my eternall rebuke, amongst all the Wenches, whose secret voyces might bee often heard to whisper these words of great comfort. (Oh excellent Hobbinot .) To all these, and more then memory will give me leave to recount, farewell. By Jone-Juniper I vow, a fortnight ile not live without thee, but my body dying for thee, shall be by our Batchelers raggedly intombe, where Loves Champions are laid. To furnish my Funerall, I bestow my fallow Cow given me by that good old woman my Grandame, my faire suite of Russet, whereon I bestowed xiii. pence in dozen lace, made to delight thee: I bestow vpon thy Brother Nicke , let him weare it for my sake, that every Holiday he puts it on, thou maist remember me whom thou hast cast away, breaking out in some place thy sorrow for the same, that the Gods of Love revenge not my death, as on that trothlesse Cresida , for her Knight Trolila , for more true have J beene to thee, then the Ivie to the Oake, or the meate (within) to the Egge shell. And the more my truth, the greater thy torment, if Clarks sayings may be beleeved (who can tell) for they were all wise men, I say no more, because I cannot. But I wish to dye, vnlesse thou grant, Therefore my Wench, looke not scant, For if thou dtst, it may thee grieve, When I am dead, that thou shouldst live, To heare the Wenches which will say, Mopsa hath slaine her Hobbinay . Thus will thy name, a by-word bee, Mongst bad and good of each degree: Then kill not him so cruelly, That for thy sake hath sworne to dye. Thine constant till Doomes day, faithfull Hobbinot .  The King greatly pleased with this invention, for that it overcame his melancholy, willed him to say, whither he were so far in love as he protest? Am I, quoth Hobbinot (I that I am) and how and J be, doe you know Mopsa that you demand such questions? Or will you knowing my griefe, perswade her from my love? The King hearing him so earnest; gave the more credit to his words, willing him to keepe the matter secret to himselfe, and to come with his Mother to the Court, at his time appointed, against which, he had by such secret espials as he procured, learned the truth of this Noble man, and his injurious dealings, which like a just Prince, he requited with death: and caused a Proclamation to be made, that whosoever they were, which could make proofe of their wrongs, should come by a day prefixed, where their cause should be heard, and restitution made, which in such sort was accomplished that his Lands, Leases, Plate, and Iewels, were distributed to the wronged. The Widdow who first gave notice thereof, the King enriched with greater possessions to maintaine her Hospitality, and Hobbinot , for that his Mopsa , should not for want of wealth refuse him, he bountifully rewarded, so that every one was pleased, and returned content to their Homes.  How the King of Trebisond furnished the Hungarian King with forces to recover againe his Kingdome, of which, Loves Heroicke Champion , is Generall, with their Adventures at Sea, and honourable Conquests by Land, with their victories.  Hungary expected the aid of Trebisond for restoring him to his Kingdome, which promise the King so regarded, that in short time, through the diligence of those Captaines to whom the charge thereof was committed, the number appointed was furnished, with shipping, munitions, and victuals, for the Army, of whom the Trebisondia King tooke the Muster, appointing their Leaders. The chiefe (by name of Generall) for the Service, was the Heroick Champion who was urged unto it by the two Kings, in such manner, that no excuse nor delayes which he could make, might be accepted, unlesse he should by his too much refusall, purchase the name of Coward: this choise greatly disliked the Knight, whose wars in Love, had but newly begun to take successe, who scarcely assured of the Princesse, although her promised Faith might put him in comfort, yet weighing the unstability of a their Sexe, he doubted lest his absence might draw her to that which he would heedfully regard being present. The tydings of her Fathers election, made of her love for generall, as Novelties are rise and flye with swift wings, came unto the hearing of the Princesse, unto whom if they were irksome, suppose you that know how grievous the parting of two faithfull Lovers are, who having her onely felicity in contemplating of her beloved Armatius , their joyes but now in the blossomes, was so nipt in the Spring, as care banished all future happinesse, and Sorrow began to claime her wonted place in both, but especially the Princesse who framed of the weaker mould, heavinesse had taken the more impression in her, so that forsaking all company her chiefest delight was to be solitary, where she might with deepe sighes and many brinish teares, unburthen her overcharged heart, cursing bitterly the cause, and causer of separating her love. In this melancholy uttering such speech of despaire, as though she saw the dreadfull Messenger Death, already seized upon the valiant Knight. The Knight who could take as little rest, as his Lady pleasure, could find content in no place, untill he came to the Princesse Lodging, whom he found in this passion, which was more grievous then all the rest, her blubbred Eyes pressing blood from his heart, beholding her in that plight, whose happy content was his onely joy. But how cumbersome so ever it was unto him, with Wisdome he advisedly weighed, that care must be comforted in time, lest taking deepe roote, they will consume the heart Subject unto it. Therefore after many kind perswasions used, he laid before her, the honour of the place assigned him, and what infamy would redound unto him refusing it, with the dishonour of him, and staine to his Progeny for ever, the cause being right, and the action of her Princely Father so charitable, whereon the wellfare of a whole Kindome consisted. The Princesse whom Griefe had neare overcome, hearing her beloved speak so honourably, and well considering it was greatly to his infamy, to deny her Father, though hardly won to patience, yet armed with hope of his valour and fortunate successe in his journey, reason and Wisdome subduing Griefe and Sorrow, she granteth her consent, heartily praying for his safe and suddaine returne, to his eternall honour, and encreasing of their Hearts content. Time that stayeth not, causeth these Princes to part, Marianus to give directions for his journey, his provision being all to make, but such care had he of the same, as he was suddainly provided of all needfull things, expecting a faire wind for imbarquing his Companies, which God sent as they desired, when each one taking leave of their Friends, with many a loath departing farewell. he betooke himselfe to the mercy of the Waves, who by his goodnesse, that commandeth and governeth all things, favoured them with so happy a Gale, that in short time they might discry the high Land of Æ gypt ; which being by his skilfull Pilots knowne, they strooke their Sailes to Hull , untill a generall Counsell was called, where every man had liberty to deliver his advise for the benefit of the Action. Where after long debating, and each perill advisedly weighed, it was determined, the Fleet should be put againe into the Sea, lest they being a huge number should be descryed, and their intent thereby made frustrate. To bring their purpose to better effect, a Frygate was slenderly manned to avoid suspition, who in thy Night rowed hard aboord the shoare, with Commission to take what ere he were they could first lay hold off, that they might be the rather advertised of the state of the country, and where the King was. This devise sorted to such effect, that through the great diligence of the Lord Diphilus , who was appointed for the same, as one desirous to gaine honour, by dawning of the day they recovered a Rocke, which opened with one of their principall Ports, under which unseen, they might shelter themselves, and yet have sight of each shallop, whether he were fisher or other, that came or went. Long had they not laine expecting of their desires: but Fortune who favoured their enterprise, discovered unto them a Galley bound for Babylon , fraighted with many passengers of honour, and exceeding rich, with Plate, Mony and Jewels. This Galley first descried, halfe dismaied the company, who feared she had beene a Man of Warre sent of purpose to surprize them, so that each one had greater desire to be gone againe, then to attempt any thing against them. But in extreams is the Noble mind best tryed, as the Lord Diphilus in this, who seeing the cowardize of such base companions, first by faire perswasions encouraged them to the attempt, shewing in his countenance his resolution, and arming them with hope of victory, not omitting the reward of so honourable an action, which if they escaped with victory being the beginning of their enterprise, deserved more to be recompenced then all the rest. To give you courage my hearts (quoth he) J say not to you, goe, but follow me your Leader, who will eyther win her, or lose my life in so good a cause. But those Speeches with those dastards prevailed not at all, who seeing the match unequall, cryed still to be gone, but Diphilus who weiged his honour farre above all, moved with great impatience at their deniall, with his Rapier drawne came amongst them, reviling them with odious Speeches, and protesting what ere he were that should in the least sort either by word or countenance, make shew to returne, should with his owne hand be murdered, and so long as he might breath, no faint-hearted villaine should dishonour him, who came to gaine honour. Therefore sweet bloods (quoth he) take courage and feare not, death with honour, is to be valued more then life, with a Kingdomes possession, who so followeth me, shall find me ever his friend, and what ere J possesse, shall have interest in it. The company how loath soever they were to be won to so hard an adventure, yet seeing the Noble man so resolute, thought it bootlesse to refuse him, or to make semblant of dislike, holding it more Wisedome to keepe his honourable friendship by their forward adventuring, then procure his envie by their cowardise, and seeing it high time to resolve, the Galley approaching them neare, they cryed to proceed, and they would all follow him, Diphilus pleased with their willingnesse, had scarce leysure to give directions for the fight before the Galley came within hayling, whose force being such and so well manned as she was, made small account of the Frygat, who although they halled many times yet making as if they heard not, bore up with them, and valiantly without words, entred her in the Prow, putting them from their Ordinance, where they within boord with their Pistols, Semitaries, and other needfull weapons, valiantly behaved themselves, Diphilus crying still courage, courage, Hungary , so long that in short time the Cavileres were all stowed, and his company leeving his Frygat entred all the Galley, as lawfull Prize to be shared amongst them. The Noble Diphilus having ended the fight, he kindly with words of favour and promise of liberty, with great reward to the slaves, urged them to apply their labour, which with so willing harts accomplished his request, that in short time they had sight of their Fleet, and beare with them all they might, which being descryed, they could not imagine whether the Galley were friend or no; wherefore the Generall to avoid perill, as Wisdome with Valour is requisit, doubting that by firing or other mischiefe, they might annoy them, he called by his flagge of Counsell, the commanders of each ship, Frygat and Galley, advising them to take great regard, how they suffered the Galley to boord them. By that time the whole Fleet was prepared in Squadrons, rowing five and five, warlike and brave. Diphilus came up with them, when the Fleet hailed them, they espyed his owne colours advanced on the Poope, and another Ensigne hanging under her sterne, which sight gave them great cause of joy, to signifie their gladnesse for his successe, each ship in the forward with their Ordnance and small shot, according to the manner of the Sea, bad him welcome. In which Tryumph, unhappily with a scowrer which negligently was shot from a Hargubuze, was the Noble Diphilus wounded, to the great griefe of all the Nobles. The Generall having understanding thereof, in his shalop boorded him with all the speed he might, carrying with him his owne Surgeon, and such as professed Physicke, doubting the Griefe to be more dangerous then it proved, whereof, albeit the report was first offensive to him, yet was comforted in this comfort, the wound not mortal, they regarding it as nothing, when the Generall had carefully seen the wound searched and drest, enquiring what they were which he had taken, he caused all the chiefe of them to be called unto him who on their examinations would confesse little, which forced the Generall to put one of the inferiours, attendant on Phydamia , the Æ gyptian Kings Brother, to be tortured, who forced with the cruelty thereof, confessed what they were, and how their going for Babylon was to entreat a peace with the Emperour, who as they were informed, levied a power to subvert their Country, in revenge of the wrong offered Timoclea sister to the Hungarian King, slaine in a battell fought at Sea, by the Æ gyptian King. This newes was no sooner revealed then welcome, for hereby they were assured of an expected friend, yet enquired the Generall, whether their King had married the Princesse Timoclea , or no, and where he lived? Sir quoth the Æ gyptian , after the victory obtained, wherein the noble Marmoricus perished, the King my Master, furnished for such an attempt, without further stay or suffering them to gather head, which he was sure they would doe, hearing of their Kings ill successe to prevent which, he framed his course thither, where they suddenly arrived, and by their power and policy, subdued the chiefest of the Nobility, who having them sure, they easily a [illeg.] time overcame the rest, w[illeg.] by generall voyces (thou[illeg.] their liking, Crowned Ki[illeg.] [illeg.] ry. How he punished t[illeg.] omit, embracing them, [illeg.] their places them far un[illeg.] [illeg.]nour and reputation, [illeg.] Gentleman or other of a[illeg.] [illeg.]veth in great servitude a[illeg.] to be relieved with needf[illeg.] apparell, at their hands w[illeg.] selves have often fed. The Princesse for all the persw[illeg.] he can use, he cannot in love obtain, y[illeg.] hath he used the good Lady, more cruelly than I would willingly report, the strangenesse of her tortures being such, as few but doe greatly pitty. And now, as our last Poasts imparted unto us, he hath appointed a time wherin she must resolutely answer him to his content, or end her life in fire. The which cruelty to her used, reported by Marchants of Babylon , with the vertues of the Princesse, and comming to the Emperours eares, being now in the prime of his yeares, either of poli[illeg.] [illeg.]ghty to release her, or whe[illeg.] [illeg.] her his Lady and Wife, I [illeg.] but he hath required her in [illeg.]etending great love unto [illeg.] King will not grant un[illeg.] [illeg.]ds of great despight hath [illeg.] in such manner, as he [illeg.]ng, hath with fire and [illeg.]im, who being a Prince [illeg.] might and force, our No[illeg.] [illeg.] [illeg.]gypt have thought good ra[illeg.] [illeg.]yne with favourable shows of [illeg.]ship, then abide the extremity of [illeg.] his fury. Loe Sir (quoth he) thus have I satisfied your request, which is all I can doe. And for the same quoth the Knight, receive thy liberty, with what other favour J may doe thee. These newes was as pleasing to the Heroicke Champion , as if he had beene possessed of the Crowne, and having such advantage, holding it small policy to lose any time, comforting Diphilus , committing the charge of his prisoners unto his good regard, he hasteneth to his owne ship, where, vnto Marmoricus King of Hungary , he recounted what he had heard, desiring that order might be presently taken, whereby the Enemy might be surprized at unawares, so might they finish their intents with lesse danger and more honour, on which they agreeing, they summoned their chiefest, unto whom, the Knight recounted what the Æ gyptian had declared, beseeching the King whose cause it was, to speake his mind; then the rest to give their advise what they thought was best to be done, for accomplishing of their desires, and planting the King in his owne Countries. These questions propounded, each particular perill, with each advantage, and occasion which offered good successe was throughly debated, when they had each one delivered their mind, Marianus , whose honour was now in the Ballance, as one that desired no worldly possessions so much as the reputation with his Mistresse and the King, said; Noble Gentlemen, you have all like resolute, brave  & hardy men at Armes, shewed in your speeches the desire you have to doe this Noble King that service for which we come, if therefore you well encline your eares to my opinion among the rest, I shall acknowledge my selfe greatly favored by you. The whole company which by curtesie was drawn to his love, was easily won to this request, and willed him say on, which he did in this manner. My Noble Lords, and friends, in Armes, touching these motions made for our proceedings, it hath beene by the Egyptian reported, whom we doe credit, the King is in possession of Hungaria , which Crown, we know all, he doth dishonourably usurpe. The Princesse, she in such extreame, that by his cruell censure is not long to live, vnlesse against her will she grant to love him, who is loathsome in her eyes. To prevent which, it behoveth vs to search the best meane that we can, and for that every one hath given his censure, this is my advise, that having these Nobles in our possession, in whom consisteth the strength of his Realme, our company being lusty and strong, we will range their confines, where finding place and opportunity, we may surprize them at vnawares, who being subdued, his force shall be the more impaired. That done, we will with all convenient speed passe for Hungaria where I doubt not but to come before the time limited the Princesse for her answer, and to reskew her, delivering the possession of the Crown, into the King, hand. The Knight having said, presently it was confirmed, and each Captaine departed to his charge according to directions given entered the cofines of Æ gypt , where they wrought by such policy and directions of Loves Heroicke Champion , that they landed in the dead of the Night, wth the greatest part of their Armies, marching in warlike order towards the City of Methimna , where the King kept his chiefe Court, and where their greatest force was. But before they could recover the Walls, or come to view the same for any advantage, they were descryed, and the Gates shut, against whom the Citizens made such power as they could for their defence, which unexpected of the Knight, caused him to stay untill himselfe went to know their pleasures and to deliver his own intent. And mounting himselfe, onely accompanied with his Herald and one Trumpet he came before the Walls, summoning them to parley, which was answer'd againe by another Trumpet, and such of the Nobility as was within, shewed themselves unto him, demanding a cause of his commiing in Armes to disturbe their Dominions, and the Subjects to their King. Nobles of Æ gypt , answered Loves Heroicke Champion, Marmoricus lawfull King of Hungary , whose Crown your King Mimaleon unjustly withholdeth, preserved by Heavens power for your Scourge, and to revenge the bloud of those Innocents slaine by your cruelty, is come with fire and Sword to require his right, which if you accept, and will deliver, he sends you by me mercy, if you deny and doe not surrender your Crowne of Æ gypt , with all the regalties, honours, priviledges and customes thereunto belonging, and become his faithfull Subjects and Liegemen, you shall all perish with the Sword and your Country flaming with fire, shall be overthrowne, in such manner, that in short time to come, there shall be nothing found but the ruines of your gorgious Palaces, and stately Cities, this hath he vowed by the honour of his name: therefore choose like wary Champions, and let me know your wills, for no detraction may be used. The Æ gyptian Peers, which heard the name of Marmoricus , whom they long sithence supposed dead, were surprized with a suddaine feare, in such manner as their senses were deprived, and they rested like men in Extasie, fearing the revenge of him, whom they did all know was by their King highly wronged, yet shewing the Nobility of their minds, shaking off feare, they said; Sir Knight, thy vnlooked for message is such as we know not suddenly how to answer, neither will we, like faint, hearted Peasants, derogate from our noble Ancestors, the honour they long maintained, with Cowardise to deliver that, which Nature and fidelity vrgeth vs to defend, our lives we esteeme as they are, vaine and every day subject to casualties and death, nor doe we enjoy that small time given vs, but onely for our Common-weale, and benefit of our country, being pillars on whom the State dependeth: You have dastard like waited opportunity to take vs at advantage, our King not present, whose right & interest we are sworn to maintain. Therfore to Marmoricus say: That as we serve our King, and live by his Grace, we will with our dearest blood withstand the invasion of any forraign Prince whatsoever. If our King, as you alleage, have offred wrong vnto him, let him revenge him on him, and seek his amends where he may get it, for other entertainment let him not looke for here. Loves Heroick Champion hearing their resolution, greatly commended their valour, and loyalty to their Soveraigne, who seeing their truth pittied lhem, and wished all men so faithfull minds: yet how well soever he liked their answer, their intents were to be considered, who came with more resolute minds, then to be wonne with faire words, and therefore returned with all haste to the Campe, whereto the King hee briefly delivered the summe of their answer, which the King tooke no pleasure to heare, rather desiring their submission by curtesie, then rhe effusion of blood; yet not to pitty them in such manner, to give over the advantage he had: wherefore that they might be assured of his resolution, which came to conquer, from his usurping Foe, taking his Army which was led by the appointed Generall, he brought them before the city, unto whom they gave many sharp and fierce Alarums, and were valiantly repulsed, not without great losse of either part. Thus continued the Assault long and dreadfull, till Marianus noting the time of the Princesse Timocleaes death to draw neare, when either she must be rescued, or dye that extreame death assigned, he determined to put all upon Fortune, to see the end, and not longer to prolong the time. And calling those whose valor he had most assurance of, he made knowne unto them his intent, requiring their company, whereunto small perswasions served, desirous to be partners with him in his actions, which were in all things very honourable. The Knight assured of his friends and followers in this action, gave directions to all Captaines at the going downe of the Sun, to be ready furnished with their companies to bid the enemy battell, doing their best before that place where their chiefe force was, in the mean time he with his accomplices would assaile some other part which was of lesse ability to defend. Thus these Noble Gentlemen, having determined to win the horse or lose the Saddle, neglected no time, that against the appointed houre, each man in his place was readily furnished, and most valiantly attempted with all warlike Ensignes to enter the city, battering, scaling, and each severall wayes searching, that policy or valour would permit, to bring the City to ruine, and vanquish the enemy, which was most nobly defended with great courage, and much losse of either part. While they were at their hardy fight on either part, it is not to be forgotten, how Loves Heroicke Champion with his associates, seeking opportunity, by chance lighted on the side of an old wall, which being somewhat decayed, they by industry of their hands and painfull toyle, easily made the breach such, that they entred at pleasure,  & passing through ye streets which led to the assaulted Gate, molested no man untill they came thither, where entring the same, slew the watch, and opened the Gate, advancing the Trebisondia Kings Colours on the top thereof, crying ever in their way as they passed, Hungary, Hungary . This cry amazed the Citizens, and armed the Trebisondians , to the hotter attempt, who entred to the rest,  & with such courage bare them, that they had soone vanquished the defendants, who to save their lives, had betaken themselves to their Churches, as places of Sanctuary, from whence they sent their wives & infants all disrobed, to fearch the King , and in their names to require his pardon, such diligence made the modest Matrones , that they were brought by Marianus to the King, where prostrating themselves at his feet, their faces bedewed with tears, they most humbly besought him to take compassion on them, their husbands, and children, that as he was a Conquerour, so with favour to use the glory of his victory, as the poore Subjects might not have cause to complaine them of his cruelty, who had done nothing blame-worthy, but as true Subjects to their Soveraign. The King, whose hart was moved with pitty at their Sute, gently tooke them up, measuring their calamity by his owne misfortunes, and bethought him of their fidelity, yet pretending a shew of unkindnesse, for refusing his mercy proffered them by his noble Generall, he would not be intreated suddainly to grant them life, which the Noble Marianus noted, and like himselfe, waying their faith to their Prince, and weale of their country, which with their lives they had sought to maintaine, he was content to remit their fault, and not onely to pardon their lives, but restore them to all former liberties, and places of honour, without any disparagement to their royalty, so that they would acknowledge him their Soveraign, and be as faithfull to him and his, as they had shewed themselvs to that usurper his enemy. This choyse at first seemed hard, yet of two evils the least is to be chosen, as these Nobles of Æ gypt , who seeing their lives, Wives, Children, and what they possest, to be in the hands of strangers, whom they could not withstand, making a vertue of necessity, were the rather won to yeeld themselves unto the Kings pleasure, at the intercession of their Wives, whose teares shed in abundance, moved them to ruth, in such wise, that subjecting on these conditios to his Excellence, they proclaimed him King of Hungary & Æ gypt , swearing fealty unto him, and delivering Hostages for their loyalty. This done, the King with generall consent crowned, the Commons gan conceive an especiall hope of his honourable love to them, whose kindnesse was such, that having the City, and whole Kingdome at his pleasure, would not suffer his Souldiers to imbeasell or purloyn in any sort, but rather make choyce to reward the Mercenary men out of his owne Treasury, which honourable beginning, gained their especiall liking: when order was taken for the government of the State: Marianus , who was mindfull of the Princesse Timoclea , hasted the King on for Hungary , ofte putting him in mind, what dangers the good Lady was likely to abide, if she consented not to ye King, who was more cruell then courteous, wherefore taking their pledges, he left the noble Diphilus his Vizegerent , to take the government upon him in his absence, and with the next favourable wind, they set Saile for Hungary , where to their good successe we leave them, to tell you more of Ottoman the Heathen Prince, who was in the Princesse Amoretta her custody.  How the Emperor of Constantinople was most grievously offended with his Son for his ill successe, and by perswasions of his Nobles sendeth his ransome, and other great gifts to the Princesse Amoretta , with the King of Hungary , and the powers of Trebisond , arriving in Hungary : The freeing of the Princes from the Usurper, and happy obtaining of his Kingdome.  of his Son, with the great slaughter of his men, was moved at the first to such choller, that he had determined for ever to abandon his Son, and never to have known or regarded him, but being perswaded by his Nobility which tenderly loved the Prince, he was at length by their motions won to conceive, how unstable Fortunes chances are, and how victories sometimes happen as well to the coward, as the valiant: not forgetting to urge unto him, how dishonourable it were for a Prince to leave the meanest Subject he had at such an exigent, that should adventure his life in his service, much more was his Majesty bound by natures lawes to relieve his Son, and not suffer him as one forsaken to remain in the hands of his Enemies: upon which motion of his Bashawes , the King caused two Galleys to be rigged and furnished, appointing of his chiefest Nobles two, for that voyage of Trebisond , as well to advertise him of his Sons welfare, which he favoured, as also to agree upon the Summe of his Ransome: All things furnished for the voyage, the Bashawes having taken leave of the Emperour, and the rest of their friends, favoured with a happy Gale, they shortly arrived in Trebisond ; of whose arrivall, the King by his Messengers was advertised: who being of nature most honourable and courteous in behaviour, caused a sumptuous trayne of Courtiers, with all the honorable manner they could, to receive the at their Port of landing, taking like order in all Lodgings, and places of repast, his Officers at his charge to attend them, which in such exquisit manner was performed, as the Bashawes with their retinue admired their entertainment. Thus by easie journyes they came to the Court, where the King with the Princesse, gave them many welcomes, enquiring kindly after the good health of the renowned Emperour their Master, whom he maligned no whit at all, how hardly soever he had measured his friendship with him. When the King and these Nobles had spent some time in discoursing; they enquired of the welfare of their Prince Ottoman , whom the King caused to be sought, and brought to their presence, before whom they bowed themselves in all humblenesse, as to the Sonne of their Soveraign, whom he againe, with all kindnesse imbraced, passing the tme with much pleasure, joying in the welfare of his friends. The King doing them all the honour that could be devised, passing the time with such recreation  & gentle sports, as the Country afford: edat length a summe of mony for the Princes ransome was a greed vpon to their content, for that it was reasonable, & the conditions honorable, which obtained their victualls by the King was releeved, & all necessaries at his charges purveyed, in such manner, and with so much bounty, as they had great cause to report honorably of the King. Long had they not tarried, but a gale of winde pleasant and favourable, present it selfe, which good time, they neglected not, but taking leave of ye King, their Prince, and Princesse Amoretta , who accompanied them onwards to their Galleys, three whole dayes journeys, they leave them to the care of their jovrney: who being imbarqued in short time arrived at Constantinople , where, how welcome they were to the Emperor and his Nobles, J omit, to let you understand of the honourable reports made of their entertainment in Trebisond , and the welfare of the Prince, whose company there were few but desired. The strangenesse of this report made of Castalinus , was exceeding admirable in the Emperours cares, who wondered not a little, that a King whom he had so much wronged, should use such kindnesse to his Son, and courtesie to his Messengers, extolling highly the honorable condition of the King, and much lamenting his owne follies, so rashly without any occasion offered, to injure him so farre, as to spoyle his Country, and to rob him perforce of his onely Child, his Sole delight and comfort. To recompence all which, and to keepe his friendship, he presently elected other Nobles for Trebisond , to be employed, which with the Princes ransome, and many rich presents to the King and his Daughter were dispatched, with Letters of love, and desire of amity, all which, comming to the Trebisondian King, were so heartily accepted as they could wish, and in presence of the Nobles, and states of both Realmes, was the peace concluded, and a band of everlasting friendship promised, to all their joyes. Thus with great delight at the earnest intercession of the King, spent those Turkish Nobles some time in Trebisond , till their prefixed time gan draw to end, when receiving their Prince with great rewards; and many thankes for their paines, they put to Sea, and were not long before they recovered their famous City of Constantinople , where they were most royally welcommed, but especially the Prince, for whose safety many pastimes were ordained, with Justings, Turneyes, Barriers, and other pleasing delights, wherein the Prince honourably bare himselfe, to the great joy of his Father, and pleasure of the whole state, who gloried greatly in him, which was likely to prove a most honourable Prince, and their ensuing comfort. But while I digresse, let it be considered, that Loves Heroicke Champion , who thirsted to see the end of his desires, slept no time, but made all possible meanes he could, as wind and weather would give leave, untill he arrived in Hungary , which he recovered in so good time as he could wish, and taking that opportunity which was offered, he landed his companies, and neare to the Sea side encamped his power, untill he might be advertised of what power the King was, and where he remained, for the attaining of which, many espials were sent out sundry wayes, and many Embuscadoes laid, to intercept such as travelled the Countrey: but their Landing being descryed, every one in all the hast they could make, nyed them to their cities and places of defence, where they, with their store of provision wch they brought were received, The King securely passed his time, taking care for and joying wholly in the hopes he conceived of his Ladies grant, being advertised of the arrivall of a forrain power, overcome with Sorrow at that instant, as one that never adversity, was surprized with such suddain heavinesse, as no words, no perswasions, nor any comfort, might mitigate his Sorrow, what pains soever his Nobles tooke to pacifie him, his guilty conscience presaging some hard fortune to be at hand: the Nobility which had more regard to his welfare, and his Country then he could on the suddain imagine, after they had caused their Rampiers to be shut, and their Fortresses to be made (doubting the worst) desirous to be resolved what the Enemy was, that thus daringly durst boord him in his owne Country, they caused the Lord Cosro-Mecha , sometime of the chiefest in Hungary , a wise and well governed Gentleman, to be sent unto them, to know whence they were, and their pretence, which against their wills, unacquainting them with their pretence, had entred their confines. The Noble man to whose charge this was committed, though he had small care of any matter, living dishonoured in his owne Country, where, in his Kings Raigne he was the onely honoured, and amongst his Nobles in most account of him, had his wits sundry wayes imployed, and on divers matters, yet amongst all imaginations, the thought of his owne Soveraigne was least, the report of his death being so certaine, but what soever he could imagine was uncertaine, wherefore as desirous to be resolved of his doubts, as the King and Nobles to be thereof certified, onely accompanied with another of the disgraced Nobility, they hyed them towards the Campe and was by the Ambuscadoes soone surprized and brought to the Pavilion of the Generall, who saluting them with kind countenance, demanded whence they were, and what occasions led them in such suspitious manner towards their Campe. The Nobles which had small care which end went forward, after they had well advised themselves, said; Sir, if we give not those Titles your honour deserves, pardon us which offend not of presumption therin, but of ignorance: that we come as spyals to view thy forces, and to discover them, therein you deceive your selfe, but come as Messengers from our King, to know thy pretence, and what thou meanest landing thy Armies without his licence, which is contrary to ye law of Arms? Jf thou come in peace and not as an enemy, resolve us this, and thou honorest us? The Prince taking their words at advantage, where they said they came from their King with a counterfeit shew of great dislike, said; Traytors how dare you to my face use those colours of simplicity, when you averre you come from your King, which I know is altogether untrue: wherefore that you shall warne the rest how they delude me, you shall have the reward of Traytors, and calling for the provost Marshall, commanded him to cut off their heads. The Nobles thinking he had beene past jest, seeing their Executioner so ready, humbly besought him to credit what they had said, which was true, and pardon their lives, for that law of Armes protecteth the Messenger of the Prince, from whom they come, therfore it would redownd to his great dishonour, to violate the hostility of all Princes. While they were thus at their shrift it chanced Marmoricus their lawfull King, to enter the Pavilion of his Generall, whose presence much apalled the Hungarian Nobles, who standing as men past themselves, had no thought but in beholding him, which so much resembled their supposed dead King, the long noting of whom, caused them to renue their sorrowes, and wish remembrance of the times they had past; to shed teares. The King imagining what they thought, knowing them well, put them from their studious thoughts thus. Men of Hungary , what meaneth your heavinesse? thinke you hereby to delude this noble Gentleman, or by your fainings, to procure your favour, if either one or other of these causes, you deceive your selves, and incurre you more trouble? Wherefore to avoid the perils incident unto you, if you be right Hungarians , and tender the welfare of your Princesse, in whose rescue we come, briefly declare unto us, in what estate she abideth, and where the usurping King hath his residence? Cosro-Mecha , hearing that pleasing tongue, wherewith he was acquainted assured himselfe that it was their King, and without further stay, humbly kissing his Majesties feet his face bedewed with teares, and his tongue faltering in his mouth, as one with suddaine joy overcome, he saith; My Gracious Soveraigne, how glad am I that I enjoy breath, to behold your Majesty alive, whom all the World reputeth for dead; the heavie tydings of which, with your ill successe, moved the hearts of your loving Subjects to such extreame heavinesse, as nothing might comfort, that past comfort, and all hope of beholding your Princely face, we reckoned you amongst the dead. In the extreame of this sorrow, as all evils commonly fall in one, when every heart and eye was deploring the losse of so gratious a Prince, then began our further griefes, through the oppressions of this usurping Tyrant, whose cruelty vnto my Subjects hath been such, as grieveth me to recount. Thy Sister he detaineth in prison, from whence he hath vowed he shall never be freed, vntill with consent she take him for her King, or by gaine-saying his demands, receive that death which he hath doomed her vnto, whose wrongs we poore men how much soever we pitty, yet can we remedy nothing, our ability being little, and our reputation lesse, amongst these cruell Egyptians who hath robbed vs of what we possest, not suffering vs to enjoy our ancient patrimony, nor what they might any way dispoyle vs off: the revenge of which, we hope in thee and thy power, who wilt maintaine and defend thy owne lawfull right, rather offering thy selfe amongst vs that honour and love thee as our lives, then leave vs any more. To the accoplishing of which, my selfe, with all thy own Countrey borne Subjects that we can procure vnto vs, will lend what ayd our weake force will stretch vnto, and therof assure your Majesty. The King hearing the lamentable report of the Lord Cosro-Mecha , could not forbeare to shew the heavinesse of his hearts sorrow, by his outward motions, yet to hide it as he might, imbracing them both; he framed a feined joy to see them, howsoever his heart was overburthened with griefe. When they had passed sometime in parley about their affaires; and that some offers were made by these Nobles, of their ayd and asistance, a generall Councell was called, where, by consent of such as had government; vnderstanding the power of Mimaleon the Vsurper, was no more but such as guarded his Holds, it was determined, after the Army had refreshed themselves two or three dayes, to march forward to the City, there to leaguer the King, and cut off from them all supply of provision for victualls, whereof they had small store. In the meane time, the Lords of Hungary , to give notice to all their friends, (with all speed) as they tendered their own liberties, to repaire with such power as they could make vnto the Camp. This devise was no sooner determined on, but the noble Cosro-Mecha , without returning to the King, spared not his paines and all others which he could command or intreat; proclaiming in every place as they passed: Marmorcius their lawfull King, straightly charging all naturall Subjects of Hungary , to make repair vnto the Campe. These tydings at first were hardly believed, yet such was the rumor of a forraign power laded, that all wch could beare Armes repaired to the King, whom they found at the assault of the City where the Vsurper kept, such was the multitudes of people, which from all countries in his Regions came vnto him, that in short time he had power sufficient to overrunne a kingdome. The vsurper Mimaleon , who had least thought ever to heare or see the Hungarian King, when report of his being in the Campe, was brought vnto him, his courage quailed, and his hope of enjoying the Crowne, was quite extinguished, so that dispairing, he became like a man lunaticke, that nothing (whatsoever) might move him to any mirth or content, so that giving over all, he cared not what became of himselfe or his, yet was he carefully counselled by his Nobles, who regarded both his honour and their safety: but whatsoever they might counsell or determine, was ill imployed; at his hands was nothing to be had, wherefore after they saw his small eare, and that he was not to be advised, they determined either in field with vnappoynted Battell to try their fortunes, or by some such composition as might be for their countries safety and their reputation, to give over their tytle pretended to the Crown of Hungary . Before that any things was of them resolved, Loves Heroick Champion , which had his mind on his Lady, as well as of other affaires, could not rest in content, vntill he had finished, and either gained what they came for, or seene the event of fortune. Wherefore to avoyd further delayes, he summoned the City to parley, wherein he required their answer, whether they would receive their lawfull King or no, if yea, they should suffer him in peace to enter, or otherwise vpon their answer, to abide the hazard incident to Armes, which he protested should be voyd of all favour, if he prevailed, and they refused this offer of his. These summons, caused the Nobility to looke with better advise into their estates, and with consideration to wey each particuler perill, which they found to be very many and dangerous, especially seeing the multitude, who were naturall Subjects, and did rather affect their own King, howsoever they professed in outward appearance, then the vsurper, which made them the more earnest with their King, vnto whom they declared the offers made by Loves Heroick Champion , with the doubts they had of his successe, who were nothing in number to the Kings power, which daily increased, and contrary, his decreased: wherefore they advised him to yeeld vnto such Articles of honor as they would require, which should be both for his honour, and safety of him and his. The vsurper hearing these perswasions from them, whereon his chiefest hope consisted, forgetting all former friendship and love to any of them, with most odious words reviled the, calling them traytors. dastards, and vpbraiding them with cowardise, which were never found but ever forward in all their actions, onely this excepted, wherein was no hope. These speeches moved his Nobles to such fury, that departing from him in discontent, they resolved for their owne safety, to seeke what meanes they could, and not by delaies to incurre his displeasure, whose friendship they were by all meanes they could vse, to intreat. Wherfore in name of all the rest, the Lord Parinthus , principall Treasurer vnto the King, by whose direction the rest would be governed, sent for the Princesse ( Timoclea ) from prison, whom he vsed with honorable speeches, comforting her with hope of her Kingly brother, who lived, and was in person come with a strong power, to deliver her from that captivity which so long she endured, humbly beseeching her grace, to become a favourable soliciter to his Highnesse for them, who were to be commanded by their Soveraigne, whose Subjects they were, protesting that neither for envy to him or his, they vndertooke the action, but at commandement, and to avoyd the ignominous title of cowardise, which all of honorable birth or mind, ought to detest. The good Princesse which could not tell, whether she might give credit to his words or no, answered him thus. My Lord Parinthus , vnder the greenest grasse lurketh the most perilous poyson, experience hath taught me, in my durance, the knowledge of friends, these suddaine offers of love to my brother; whom you all know, is long sithence dead, causeth me the more to dread, I am going to him, and that your offered friendship is but to that end to bereave me of that which long since I wished to leave, if it be so, good my Lord; hide not the truth therof from me, for therein shall you shew your charitable mind to a distressed Captive. Farre be it from my thought, Noble Lady, quoth Parinthus , that I should any way delude you, or move you to credit any thing other then truth, whom I hold my greatest hope of good, to assure you of which, so pleaseth your Excellence, I will my selfe bring you to his Majesties presence. When the Princesse heard him make these proffers of favors and perceived by his jesture he did not counterfeit, overcome with joy, she was in a trance, from which revived by the carefull industry of the Lady Baldraca , wife to the Lord Parinthus , she gave the Nobleman great thankes for his tydings, assuring him on her word, that she would so recompence that good, as he nor his, should have any cause to coplaine of her vngratefulnesse. Vrging him with her curteous speech, to detract no time but to bring her to the Campe where the King was, which he willingly yeelded vnto, and causing a stately Charyot to be ordained, and richly apparelling the Princesse as befitteth her, accompanied with his Lady and two daughters of rare beauty, himselfe wayting on her disrobed, issued out of the gates, and in short time came neere the Campe, and were by the Sentinels discovered, and brought to the Kings presence, who seeing the Princesse, whom he had great doubt the tyrant would have murthered, so sudden a joy surprized him, as he might not speake; yet overcomming his passion, joyning his face with hers, after many kind imbracings, he saith; Timoclea , how have the heavens blessed me, in giving me life to behold thee, more deare vnto me then a million of lives, whom sithence I possesse, as the onely joy I conceived hope of in this world, I account my happinesse more, then to be possessed of the worlds revenew. But tell me Timoclea , what are these that accompany thee, strangers to me they are, how friendly soever they have vsed thee. Most gracious Soveraigne, for these noble persons, I am to intreat; having passed my word, to be their safe conduct from any violence should be offered the, therefore good my Lord, receive into your favor the Lord Parinthus , Treasurer to the vsurper, his Lady and daughters, such as are by them protected, so shalt thou honor me the more, by maintaining my word, which relying on your Princely nature, I have past. Loves Heroick Champion , willing to hold her honour in regard, said; Madam, how his Majesty on the sudden may be wonne to favour your sute, I cannot say, having had such great cause to revenge him on their cruelty, but for his life, let him thanke your grace, if he enjoy it. The King, whose heart pitty moved to tender the sute of the Princesse, comming towards the noble Parinthus and his Lady, with great curtesie took them from the earth whereon they kneeled accepting them to his Majesty, vsing them with such honor and curtesie, that they admired him. After he had revived with his kind confections these sorrowing suters, he said; Parinthus , as I have pardoned thy life, so faile nor to tell me thy Kings determination, whether he will yeeld, or in battell try the event of our fortunes.  How the Lord Parinthus discribeth vnto to the King the whole estate, and determination of the Vsurper, who flying from the forces of the puissant Army, is by Loves Heroick Champion pursued and taken, whom he sendeth for a present, to the Princesse Amoretta , to Trebisond .  grace, is more then I can say, for such desperate humors assaileth him, that he is not himselfe, and friends faileth him, from the Noble to the Peasant, whose wisedomes have with grave advise considered, what wrongs have beene offered your Grace, and hath upon your Princely motions of mercy, solicited him to pitty them, and yeeld vnto your grace, which when he could not be perswaded vnto; we all left him, and I in name of all the Nobility humbly beseech your Highnesse of mercy, who onely attendeth but my returne, at which time on your gracious word, they will deliver the City. My Lord, quoth the King, what cause soever I have in the most extreamest manner to revenge me on you all, yea to the very child that sucketh, that I omit. And that thou and they all shall know I delight not in blood, nor wish I the life of my mortall foe, returne vnto them, and from me say; that if in submissive wise, they issue their gates, and at my feet crave mercy, bring with them their vsurping King. I will accept them, so thou and they shall sweare your dutiful allegeance to me and mine, they shall be hereafter maintained in such manner as becommeth faithfull Subjects to their Prince, I will admit them to my grace,  & will be vnto them a loving and gracious soveraigne. Parinthus , which had that he most desired, vttering with many deepe sighes, the joy his heart conceived for his good successe after many humble and hearty prayers for the Kings life in all happinesse to be maintained, he besought his Grace to give him leave with his happy tydings, to make glad the hearts of those sorrowfull Nobles which expected his returne, which the King granted, detaining his wife and daughters to attend his sister, whose joyes exceeded the extreames of her misery, enjoying her Noble Brother, which she was out of all hope ever to behold againe. To their recreation we leave them, and passe on with the Lord Parinthus ; who made no stay vntill he came to the gates, where divers of his friends expected his comming. No sooner entred he the City, but summoning the Nobles and Governours all together, he delivered vnto them, what favour he had received of the King, and how willing he was to shew like clemency vnto them all, vpon these conditions specified, wherevnto hee perswaded them to yeeld, not omitting any thing to make them mindfull of the little hope they had of the Vsurpers successe; for which they had no reason to encline unto him, who had so small regard of them, but rather let him endure the reward of his owne follies, then that so many should perish for one mans wrongs. Resolved thus, they hastened unto the Court, at whose sodaine entring, the King was greatly appalled, considering in what discontent they parted with him, yet shewing a countenance voyd of all feare, hee required the cause of their comming whom they soone resolved, letting him know each particuler of their intent, perswading him to patience, for what they had determined should bee accomplished. The King hearing his owne doome of misery pronounced, albeit it moved him to great impatience, yet restraining choller, with his smooth speech he besought them of respite for his answer till the next morning, which they willingly consented unto. And so leaving him they departed each one to his severall mantion. But he in whose heart revenge harboured, having his mind wholly bent on their ruine, after he had conferred with such as were as full of mischiefe, as himselfe of cruelty, and was by them advertised what power they were of, he caused them secretly in the night Armed, to assemble at the Court, where in very covert manner they remained untill the time came that the Nobles should come to receive their answer, who voyd of all suspect of evill entred the Pallace, desirous to know his pleasure touching the matter then between them in question. No sooner came they to the Kings presence, but the cruell Tyrant shewing in his countenance the pretence of his heart, began in tearmes of great reproach to exclaime against the Nobles whom he accused of treason and unjust dealing against him and the state of his Countrey, that flying from him which was their lawfull Soveraigne, sought to supplant him to Crowne another. But Traytors, quoth he, you shall reape such reward as your treachery deserveth, and there withall giving the watch-word, his confederates which for the purpose was Ambushed, issued vpon them, and suddainely surprized as many as they could come by, the rest that fled, entring the City, proclaimed the lawfull King, offering in his name free Pardon of life and goods, to as many as followed them. At which offer of grace, the Commons wearyed with oppression of the Vsurper, in multitudes assembled themselves, and guyded by Parinthus , they fiercely assailed ye King in his Court, sleying as many as they could reach vnto, and rescue their fellow Nobles, whose deaths by the Tyrant was determined, had not the valour and pollicy of this noble Parinthus prevailed. In this exploit, many of the company of the Usurper were slaine, himselfe with such as escaped, betooke them to the Mountaines, where they Encamped themselves, expecting ayd of those he had preferred. But they more regarding their own weale, then his honor;  & seeing no comfort or hope of recovery, submitted themselves vnto the Kings mercy, and were of him received. This Canvesado passed: the commons with generall voyce elected Marmoricus for their King. Parinthus poasted him with all speed to the Campe; and to the King declared the trecherous pretence of the Usurper; with the event of all his and their actions, and in the name of the whole State besought him to receive the Crowne, and the faithfull love of all the Commons. Marmoricus hearing the mischievous pretence of this Vsurper, pittying his Subjects that had so long been governed by a Prince so ill conditioned, at the earnest intercession of the noble Parinthus ; guarded with a troupe of his trustiest men at Armes, marched to the City, at the entry of which, the whole Nobility, bare-legged and barefooted received him; and to his Highnesse delivered the keyes of their Ports, with presents of rich price, marching before him to the Pallace, crying with a generall voyce Marmoricus, Marmoricus . The King noting his Subjects loves, with hearty thanks requited them all, exhorting them to obedience and loyaltie, which if they faithfully followed, he would be a mercifull Prince unto them. Marmoricus in possession of his Crowne, willing his friends should participate with him, dispatched a Messenger for Loves Heroick Champion , the Princesse and her attendants, who all as their duty obediently fulfilled his commandement, Loves Heroick Champion excepted; who carefull of his charge, and looking into the practices and devises of the Vsurper, besought his Grace to pardon his not coming to the Court for a time untill he had seene the event of his affaires, and sending for such guides as he was informed to be well acquainted in those Desarts, he put himselfe in search for the Usurper and his scattered crew, whom in short time he found to the number of one thousand, on horse and foot, which he no sooner espyed, but cheering his Companies, which were not above forty, not minding to give them dayes, hee bravely assailed them and so valiantly behaved himselfe in that conflict, that after two whole houres spent in hardy feates of Chivalry, there was few of the companies living. The King he surprized as he was flying, with whom he returned to the City, and to the King Marmoricus delivered him, who kindly accepting his Present, returned the Knight many thankes for his paines. This brunt past, and all things by the valour and industry of Loves Heroick Champion brought to quiet end, the King unwilling to detaine his Subjects from their owne homes, recompenced every man for his good service, and dislodged the Campe. A world of wonder it were to recount what generall joy was throughout the Land for the returne of their King and his good successe, for which great Tryumphs were ordained with Justs, Barriers, and Tilt, wherein the Nobles of the Countrey in great bravery behaved themselves, but the best  & chiefest honour in each severall action was given Loves heroick Champion , who like him selfe, so behaved himselfe, as there was no talke throughout the Court and Countrey, but tended to the generall commendations of this noble Prince. Thus as all things hath end, so ended these Thyumphes, and the King in peace enjoyed his Kingdome, which through the Trebisond Kings assistance, and the valor of this honoured Knight he obtained. All things quieted, Loves Heroick Champion , after he had a small time reposed himselfe from his travels, humbly besought his Highnesse to suffer him with his Companies to depart, which favour he could not by any intreaty obtaine. Wherefore to satisfie the King, with his owne longer stay, he dismissed his Army, whom the King so royally rewarded, as no man had cause to complaine of his time spent, but every one to speake of his honour and bounty. The conduct of whom, after he had with great care purvaid them victuals, with all things necessary, he committed to Pomarius , a Noble man of Trebisond , by whom the Knight advertised the King of his stay, which was chiefly for the Lord Diphilus , whom they left Vizeroy in Æ gypt , recommending also his service vnto the Lady Amoretta , he presented by this noble Pomarius the Usurper vnto her as prisoner, (and his Conquest.) Thus all things carefully purvaid, the winde blowing a favourable gale, they imbarqued themselves, and sayling with a wind as they could wish, they shortly arrived in safety at their desired Port, where their welcome was such of the King, as they might joy to receive it, where friend with friend joyed for their returne: onely the Princesse endured the greatest penance, missing the return of her Knight, who could not be perswaded of his welfare wanting his presence, yet accepted she the Vsurper his Prisoner, and through the great protestations of the Lord Pomarius , had hope to see him againe, whose heart enjoyed small content wanting his company.  How old Machaon sometime Tutor to the Prince Armatius , now Loves Heroick Champion , had answer from the Oracle at Delphos , how the Prince lived, and what joy hee conceived thereof, and still continued his search for him.  Hungarian King, spending his time in small content, wanting the sight of his desired Lady, and his Lady with teares bewailing him, whom she more desired then the worlds possessions, to shew what hapned the ancient Machaon , who as you have heard before, left the Carmanian Court, with all his possessions. Pilgrim-like journeying towards Delphos , there of the Oracle to bee advertised of his King, and the Princes life or death: and comming to the sacred Chappell of Apollo , after his Orizons done, and his offerings made before the shrine of Apollo , the pittifull God moved at his intercession, and considering the faithfull love to his Prince and Country, which is pleasing both to Gods and men, after he had with teares bewailing his Prince, was thus answered. Machaon , thy faithfull love to Prince and Country, we have regarded,  & moved with pitty of thee and thy Commonwealth, whose Subjects distressed, desire to have knowledge of their King, & his Princely Sonne, with what shall befall them, receive these lines, which shall import the event of all; yet for a time conceale them, & continue thy travell. Machaon , whose heart was lightened with this comfortable voyce, looking about him, espyed a paper, which taking vp, he read in this manner.  Ambitious shall your land with Warres annoy, Taking by force what Subject doth enjoy. A forraigne power these Rebells pride shall quell, Through whom, your commons, shall in quiet dwell, Before his face, whom they suppose for dead, The Traytors shall for life, with pitty plead. A stranger Queene on Kingly Seate shall sit, Vnto whose rule your Commons shall submit. Religious, seeing your Countryes happy state, Overcome with joy, shall dye at Princes gate. He vnto whom your Crowne belongs aright, Is all in one, a Merchant, King, and Knight. Supposed lost, thou once againe shalt meete In forraigne soyle, sitting on Princely seate. When in thy travaile such one thou shalt see, As such there is, which shall be found by thee. Returne thou then else dread thy guiltlesse blood, Whose life preseru'd is for thy Countryes good. When the aged Pilgrime had perued these Lines, musing at the darknesse of the same, which he construed many wayes, yet had no certainty, wherefore resolving on the mercifull favor of the Gods, which had so pittifully heard his prayer, he passed on his journey, in search for those Princes, which he hoped were living, whom to his travaile we leave, to returne vnto the Princesse Timoclea , who having the company of Loves Heroick Champion , had sundry motions of desire to enjoy his Love, evermore applauding his person, curtesie, and valour, which so so farre exceeded all mens in her judgment, that she honoured him for the onely Paragon of the world, holding her for the most happiest Lady on the earth, which should enioy his love wishing that she were worthy of his love. and framing herselfe by all meanes that modesty would permit, to gaine it. But he whose heart was fixed on his Lady, had no motion of any other, onely wished to be with her whom he so much honoured, whose presence he more desired, then all the riches in the world could afford. Tormented with these restlesse passions, which was of the King and Courtiers noted, especially of the Lady Timoclea , many imagined the cause, yet none so good a Physitian to find the truth, or cause thereof; as continuall care weakneth the body, and causeth many extreames, so Marianus feeling himselfe a weakenesse of nature, and looking for some disease, through his melancholy to ensue, finding the King at convenient time, hee humbly besought him of a favour to depart, alleadging that the ayre, and contagiousnesse of those confines, was nothing agreeing with his body, are that his longer stay might be by his confusion. The King which loved him as his owne soule, and tendering his welfare more then all the wealth of his Kingdome, whom he had found so kind and forward, adventuring his life for his good in many broyles, though loth to leave him in whom so much he delighted, yet nothing his melancholike humours, which had much altered his complexion, imagined it was no excuse, and therefore the rather condescend to his request, appointing a time as he desired, when if God sent winde and weather, to be ready with their Shipping, to conduct him to Æ gypt , whether the King promised with his Sister and Nobles to accompany him, for which journey, a strickt command was given to all Officers to see each thing necessary purvayd which with such diligence was performed, as in short time all things was as they could wish or desire furnished, onely attending a faire winde to set Saile, which they stayed not long for. But a gale fitting their purpose, the King whith his Sister, Loves Heroick Champion and their traine, embarqued themselves for Æ gypt , where by the good furtherance of him that commandeth all, they shortly arrived in safety whose comming, being knowne vnto the Vizeroy Diphilus , with such provision as they could make on the suddaine repaired vnto the place of Landing, where the King joyfull to see the good recovery of Diphilus , in most kind manner imbraced him. And so generall welcomes being given on all sides by the Nobles, they passe on towards the Pallace of the King, who with a zealous love of his Commons, was to his great delight welcommed with such shewes of joy, as on the sudden they could prepare. Thus after some time spent in banquetting and other pastimes for their welcomes, to beguile the time the better, Loves Heroick Champion standing on thornes, vntill he might behold the sweet content of his lives comfort, finding Diphilus in a place where they might discusse at large their minds. The Knight not forgetting his promise made to Diphilus in his owne Country, and willing to make amends for the wrong he had there, thus sayd; My Lord, what I have to impart vnto you as one that wisheth your good, is such as becommeth a friend, vowed to doe your Lordship what service my ability can stretch vnto, onely I beseech you, promise on your Honour to conceale what I shall discover. Diphilus , who both honoured and loved the Knight, musing to what these speeches tended, relying on the fidelity of him whom he never had heard or seene to commit any dishonourable action, gave him his word and honour, to be as secret in all things as he could desire, which the Knight accepting, thus sayd: My Lord, first I humbly beseech your favourable love, to be continued, and pardon my great offence committed against you in Carmania , where my selfe, (not my selfe) I committed a most hainous and dishonourable fault, for which I am willing to make such satisfaction, as you can require. Diphilus hearing the Knight vse these speeches of submission, noting them well, and bethinking himselfe what had fortuned being in Carmania , could not call to mind any vnkindnesse offered him by any inferiour person, neither did he well remember the Princes discurtesie, yet leaving nothing vnsought, calling his wits together, bethought him of the Prince, whom he forbare to answer, vntill he had with earnestnesse noted the Phisnomy of the Knight, whose face with long sicknesse, wherewith he was at that time possest, was quite altered from the forme it now had, which made him more to admire. But calling to mind the resemblance of the aged King he conceived by some signes of his favour, that it was Diphilus , the Prince yet doubtfull he was, for that being so borne, he came to the Carmenian Court with no better countenance then a Merchant. After many thoughts, not willing to offend through rashnesse, or to offer any kindnesse, he humbly besought him in true friendship which he had found, to pardon him, which could not call to mind no wrong done him, nor any familiarity that ever had beene betweene them. Well my Lord, (quoth the Knight) I see your mind is tree from revenge, that know not those that have endangered your life, and therefore am the more willing to reveale my self, to cleer you of this doubt. Know that I am Armatius , yt vnhappy Prince of Carmania who in my Fathers Court so much abused you, whereof I repent me, and have sorrowed for it. But pardon me good Diphilus , and accept that friendship, I vowed vnto you, which will endeavour to deserve thy love in all occasions wherein true love consisteth. To give you some cause to credit what I say, I have thought good to find this opportunity, not onely to reveale my selfe to you, whose favour I desire, but to my best endeavour to deserue the same, and to advance thy estate, if so you can like of my offer. Diphilus amazed at these speeches, after he had with more advised eyes beheld the Prince, was assured it was he, prostrating himselfe on his knee, humbly besought his Grace of pardon which had so vnreverently behaved himselfe. But gracious Prince (quoth he) faults vnwillingly committed, deserve the least punishment, I speake for my selfe, which am ready to make amends, in performing any pennance it shall please your Highnesse no enjoyne me, yeelding many millions of thankes for that favour you have vouchsafed, in giving me that credit to reveale your selfe, to the vnworthiest of many in high esteeme, which desireth your Highnesse knowledge, vowing by the honour of my noble Ancestry, to be governed and directed by the Prince Armatius , and shall so please it your Highnesse, follow your Grace, wheresoever it shall stand with your good pleasure to conduct me. The Prince, interrupting his speech, lovingly imbraced the Lord Diphilus , giving him many thankes for his kind offers, which he was assured was faithfully spoken. In recompence of which my Lord (qd. he) and to make you some satisfaction for my former wrong offered you; I will endeavour to advance your estate, so it stand with your good liking, in this manner. You see (my Lord) though with some trouble and effusion of blood on either part, the King in peace and quiet enjoyeth his owne Country, and with the Crowne of his enemy, is likewise invested. Alluring baytes are Kingdomes, and have caused many Nobles who not content with their owne estates, to hazard honour, life, and whatsoever else they enjoyed, to attaine vnto them. But my Diphilus , if thou canst frame thy liking to my wish, and bend thy minde to the love of Timoclea , the Princesse, my endeavour shall be to obtaine her for thy Lady, and the Kingdome of Æ gypt for her dowry, besides, she is heire to her brother, who dying without issue, shall to higher honours preferre thee. This is all my noble Diphilus , that I have to say, and (so much I say) for that I wish thy advancement, if thou like the Lady, and have not bestowed thy liking elsewhere. Say thy mind, as vnto him which not onely in this, but in all other matters wherein I may doe thee good, command me as thy selfe. Diphilus , who was wise and well demeaned, endued with valour and curtesie, as much as might be required, humbly returned many thankes for this vnexpected good, moved with a desire of Kingly dignity, well content, to enjoy so brave a Princesse for his love, without farther stay, said; My honoured Lord, I cannot frame my tongue to yeeld such thankes as my heart would vtter, onely this good I crave, that your Highnesse continue your gracious favour towards me, whose will shall be ever a law to Diphilus , who will ever be directed by your Majesties advise. And seeing most honorable Prince, you have motion of willingnesse to doe me this good, I humbly beseech you continue it, and bind Diphilus in everlasting bands of true friendship to your service. Here were they interrupted, by the comming of the King, who hearing that the Prince was gone that way, delighting in his company more then in any others, came suddainely on them, yet not in such manner, but he was espyed of them. The King which saw them so earnest in their speech, comming vp with them said; Sir Knight, were my Lord Diphilus a Lady, as he is an honorable Gentleman, I should be very suspitious of you both, that you would find time to stretch a pointe farther then became you. In faith Gentlemen (quoth he) as there is brotherly love betweene you, which the world well noteth, let be a trinity, and accept me for the third person, so shall you honour me more then I will say, and endue me with such happinesse as I will not for avoyding of flattery. Your Majesty quoth the Prince, may jest, but would it were knowne vnto your grace, our loves to your Highnesse, you might then say, you have such poore friends of vs, as will ever be ready to venture our lives in your honourable service. Experience good Knight, answered the King, long sithence hath taught me that, whose eyes are witnesses of your loyaltie, which I will endeavour to requite, as when you please to make tryall you shall find, especially you my Lord, whose blood lost in adventuring for me I can no way requite. Seeing quoth the Prince, your Highnesse is thus disposed to jest, pardon I beseech you what I have to say, and favour me so much, as to heare my humble sute (and hearing) let me obtaine it at your gracious hands, in granting which, your Grace shall more honor me then J dare report. Honorable Knight, answered the King, among friends what should need distrust, my heart grieveth that the noble Knight Marianus , should doubt to obtaine what ever resteth in my power to grant. Wherefore sweet friend say on, for by the honour of the Hungarian kingdome, whose Crowne I enjoy through thy good industry, what ever thou requirest shall not bee denyed. Thankes gracious Lord, not for myselfe I intreat, but for this Gentleman whose heart having sworne fealty to Love, which is the soveraigne guide of all men, hath framed his liking unto the Princesse Timoclea , whose servant he hath vowed himselfe; if then noble Prince it shall stand with your Highnesse good pleasure to accept of him, whose honourable birth and haughty deeds of Chivalrie may merit some esteeme with persons of worth, I have my desire (by granting of which) and obtaining the Princesse good liking, I shall be more honoured, then if your Grace had invested me with both the Kingdomes of Hungary and Æ gypt . Marianus , quoth the King, if thou hadst required as much for thy selfe as thy friend, thou couldst not have honored me more, whose amity I desire to participate with, above all men of what account soever: but seeing thy request is for him whose advancement I desire, and for that thou shalt know in what regard I hold thy love, I will doe my best to procure her love, women have fancies, and are head-strong in their affects, whether shee have granted her love I know not, neither can I force her liking, if I could, it were not convenient, for a forced beast is froward, and women wedded to their will. If in their love they should be contraried, were better lost then found, their revenging minds are such, as they will not be quiet, vntill for their husbands safety they have armed his head with such proofe, that he may walke in safety amongst the best headed stags in my Forrest. But leaving this jest, ( Marianus ) that thou maist assure thee of my love, my industry shall be to gaine her for thy friend, whom I both honour and love, and for you my Lord, I give hearty thankes, thar will accept of her, whom I (may say) I love as a brother, who if I can perswade, to your wish, her large dowry shall testifie. Our pleasant parley hath procured me a good appetite, my stomack telleth me it is dinner time, wherefore Gentlemen, leaving this talk wch is as much conquest as the greatest of Hercules , which did never conquer woman, (vnto me) let us walk,  & doubt not but J will play the Orator in such wise as shall procure your content Lord Diphilus , and satisfie your request. Thanks gracious Prince quoth Diphilus which is all J have to requite so great a benefit, onely your true liegeman shall I ever continue, and be ready at your pleasure, to doe you service.  How the Trebisond King dyed, leaving the Kingdome to the Princesse Amoretta , the King of Hungaria wooeth his Sister the Princesse Timoclea for Diphilus .  flesh is mortall) vexed with an extreame sicknesse, was so oppressed therewith, that nature failing through weake age, all Physicke helpes were frivolous, so that perforce hee must pay his due to death which commandeth all, whose breath failing at the sommon of this tyrant, which may not be intreated, his soule departed this earthly trunke, to see the joyes of the everlasting Kingdome, whose death his Subjects so with pitious plaints bewailed, as might have changed the most hardest heart in a Chaos of lamenting sorrowes, beholding their teares, whose body was most royally intombed amongst his Ancestry. But among those which sorrow overwhelmed, and had like to have drowned in deaths gulph, the Princesse whom nature forced in some sort to lament, as a Child having lost her Father, was so weakned with her plaints and harts sorrow, that long time it was not to be thought she could recover it, so much was her tender heart touched, oftentimes bewailing her Fathers death, and then againe grieving for the want of her Love and Lord the Heroick Champion , of whose safety whom she more desired then to be Lady of the whole earth, could not be perswaded. Long did shee languish in these extreames and could not be comforted, insomuch that she rather desired death then to live. But hee that in extreames is our best comfort, preserving her for the Commons benefit, sent her health, who being recovered, the Coronation finished, and the Crowne by comon consent of the Parliament confirmed unto her, many offers of Marriages were made unto her, for which, humble sutes of her Councell were not omitted, who desired nothing more, then to have the issue of her noble body succeed her. But no perswasions might move her from the Knight, who had the chiefe interest of her heart, to whom she had vowed her selfe, protesting likewise, never to grant her love or liking to any one, but onely to him. This resolution so much greeved her nobles, that nothing could breed more discontent, yet aa duty commanded, framed themselves to her government, who with such wisedome directed all things for the benefit of her commonweale, that it was admirable to behold that wisedome in one of her sexe. But to returne to our matter. The Hungarian King, who minding his honorable word with the noble Marianus , finding opportunity, gan question his sister in this manner. Timoclea , since the decease of our deare Parents, thou hast beene left unto my government, for whom (without boast) or desire of benefit of thee or any, I have had that care as of mine owne good, and ever will, so thou be ruled by me. And for that I see thy yeares requireth to be linked in marriage, that thou maist participate in love with thy Husband, and spend the prime of thy yeares as is fitting thy estate, I have found a Gentleman of honour and valour, such a one, as on my word loveth thee, and I have cause for his paines in my service imployed to honour. Therefore good sister, if thou love me as a Brother and hast not bestowed thy love elsewhere, in this matter be ruled by me, and in doing whereof, thou shalt finde me thy brother, and most assured friend who will ever be as carefull of thy well doing and honour, as of mine owne good. Say therefore thy minde plainly and let me know whether thou doest love, or canst love? The Lady, whose wisedome was such as ballanced her honour, not knowing whether her Brother were in jeast or earnest, thus modestly said: Gracious Lord, and my dread Soveraigne, pardon I humbly beseech you, your subject, and suffer me not through my fond answering so frivolous a question, which you vrge but for tryall, to procure your displeasure, or mine owne shame. Why Timoclea , quoth the King, you mistake me, if you thinke I jest, for on my honour, I meane what I say, therfore dally not with me, if your hope of my good. But tell me if thou doest love, or wilt love my friend? The Lady hearing the King in earnest, although she could be well content to have enjoyed the sweet pleasures of love in marriage, thus said: Dread Lord, and my most gracious soveraigne, sithence it is your pleasure I should answer your demand, know, that as modesty is the ornament of Maids, and chastity the garland that beautifieth all our sexe, so have I carefully weyed mine honour in such manner, that I neither love, nor as yet ever made choyce of any in love, but have eschewed all such frivolous motions of the flesh, to to my greatest power, as beseemeth a Lady of such honour that I may love, I doubt not, because it is the commandement of our Maker, and incident to all creatures, who in their kinds make choyse of some one to participate with: yet shall my love never be such, as may disparage your Highnesse love towards me, but such as shall be to your content. And as for your Graces pleasure to bestow me on a man so honourable, so standeth is with your will to let me know him, I will answer more directly, God a mercy for that wench, quoth the King, then I doubt not but we shall have a match, or else thy wisedome is not such as I wish it were. But tell me vnfeinedly my Timoclea , canst thou love the Lord Diphilus , a man for birth honourable, for valour to compare with most adventuring Knights in the world, in person comely, and so debonnaire in his behaviour, as for curtesie, he is to be matched with the best? He is the man Madam, whom if you can fancy, thou honourest me in thy love, and thou shalt find me a brother, nay a Father, if Fathers love may exceed the brothers. Say therefore thy mind; and let me know thy answer. The Lady whose hope was, her brothers sute had beene for Loves Heroick Champion , with whose love she was a little touched, yet modesty mastering such fond motions, would not let affection take such roote, but that she could at her pleasure expell it. After the Lady had heard her brother, whom she perceived by his earnestnesse in vttering his sute, would not willingly be denyda, she said; Pardon me my good Lord, if I passe modesty, considering your great praise of the Gentleman, beleeve me, he is much beholding vnto your Grace, who could have thought you would have proved so good a soliciter; had your study been the Lawes of this Realme, no doubt, but you should have had many Clyents: were the Gentleman here himselfe, he could not have said thus much; and therefore he may thinke himselfe beloved and honoured of your highnesse. But for answer, as I would have you in your first wooing disgraced, least it discourage you in your owne enterprises being a Batchelor, so can I say little of my selfe, who is to bee governed by you, to whom in all humblenesse I referre me, and shall so you be pleased, be content, if it were with one not so worthy as the Lord Diphilus . (And yet.) Nay Madame, quoth the King, leave not off so abruptly with an a parenthesis, your words are doubtfull. Tell me therefore, is there any other before me? if there be, and thou hast made choyce, (and you both agreed) I will not gainsay it, nor tye thee to any other then thy owne content in marriage. Therefore say, what those words (and yet) imported? Pardon my overboldnesse, gracious Lord, answered the Lady, which unadvisedly overpast those speeches, and credit my word, which have no love fixed in my heart, but will endeavour my selfe to the liking of him whom you shall command mee, yet will J answer your demand, and meaning of those words, taken so by your Grace at rebound, though I must and will, frame me to the love and liking of the Lord Diphilus . Yet had the noble Generall beene pleased, and with that, a deepe sigh stayd her tongue, in such wise, as she could goe no further. The King vnderstanding which way the winde of her desire blew, though he could have been better content with her choyce, yet to put her from other thoughts, and to have his sute take effect, he perswaded her to let slip such fond imaginations, for that he had placed his love on a Ladie of his Country, whom he would not leave for all the world. With these happie tydings for the Lord Diphilus , after some other kind speeches to the Ladie, the King departed, so joying in his good successe, that he could not rest vntill he had comforted the Lord Diphilus with his answer, whose mind egged on by Loves Heroick Champion , was so fixed on the Ladie, that she was become the Mistresse of his heart, and he joyed in nothing but in contemplating of her love, thinking every day a yeare, and every houre a moneth, vntill he heard the Kings answer, musing thus on his Love, tossing with a mind disquieted, from one side of the bed to the other, his Page brought him word, that a Gentleman fro the King attended to speake with him, which suddaine newes; revived so his spirits, as made his heart more light, then long time before it had beene, hoping to heare such tydings as his loving sute required. The messenger having delivered his message, judge you that be lovers, whether you could slacke any time vntill you heard the doome of your Mistresse, which he was assured to doe by the King, vnto whom he hasteneth with such speed as he could. To whose presence being come, the King as joyfull for his good successe and his sisters grant, as the Lord Diphilus to heare it, with a smiling countenance, which shewed the joy of his heart: said; My Lord, though my skill in wooing be but small, having never accustomed my selfe to any such practise, yet have I playd the cunning Advocate for your Lordship, and will assure you, so you hold your word and promise, the Princesse shall be yours, and thereon take my word of honour. Diphilus so over-joyed at these tydings, could not well tell whether he heard the King speake, or dreamed of this happinesse. But standing a while in an extacie, his sences being come againe, with eyes gastly beholding the King, thus said; My honourable and gracious Lord, what may I do to requite your Princely favour, who hath vouchsafed me so great honour, not onely to bestow your onely Sister on me, but to become my honourable soliciter, what I would say, modesty compelleth me to conceale. Onely this J assure your Majestie, my loyall service shall ever be readie at your command, in such dutifull manner, that your Majestie shall have no cause to repent of so great a good done vnto a stranger. Enough my Lord, few words doth suffice among friends, wherefore forbeare these speeches, love my Sister, and for her sake, thinke of me as a friend, which will be ever ready to doe you what pleasure I can. To give you some interest of my faith, appoint the marriage day at your pleasure, and for her dowry, accept this Kingdome of Æ gypt which shall remaine to you and your heires for ever, onely this homage shall you yearely tender in my Court of Hungaria , two swift running Coursers of this Country, and so God make you happie in your love, and a joyfull Father of many Children. With this Loves Heroick Champion entered his presence, vnto the King what man so welcome, his duty done, the King lovingly imbracing him, said; Sir Knight, I have not long sithence comforted your friend with my happy tydings, and not onely assured him of a wife which I hope will prove loving  & kind vnto him, but have inuested him with the title of the King of Æ gypt , of both which I wish him so much joy, as I desire to haue joy, his Wedding day let him appoint at his pleasure, which shall with the greatest honour I can be performed. Most gratious and dread Lord, quoth the Knight, how this your honourable curtesie have tyed me vnto your service, I omit, that at my request hath thus favoured my deare friend, whose good I esteeme as mine owne, and ever will be ready with my best endeavour to serve, at all times and places where my force or service may doe, either your Majestie or my Lord Diphilus good. And seeing it is wrought to his content, and your Graces good liking, let me intreat this favour of you both, that the Wedding may suddainly be solemnized, for that my stay may not be long here, such desire I have to see my Soveraigne Lord, who J am sure expecteth my returne long before this time. Sir (quoth the King) did you know how displeasing those speeches of your departure were to me, that desire nothing in the whole world so much as your copany, you would never harpe so much on that string. But how long soever your stay shall be, this day eight dayes J doe appoint for the Wedding, so my Lord Diphilus be agreed, and say Amen . Never (quoth Diphilus ) let him be allowed for Clarke, which refuseth to say Amen , to such a Parson, the Orizons bringing such content, seeing your Majestie referres it to me, Amen say J, and humbly thanke your Grace for your honourable favour. The Wedding day appointed and assigned, the King sent for the Princesse who that night supped altogether, which being ended, the Princesse in presence of many of the Lords of Hungaria and Æ gypt , was betrothed vnto the Lord Diphilus , and the Marriage day appointed, against which time, were all the Nobles summoned to be at Court to attend the King, by whose commandement all the preparation for honour of that day might be devised, was ordained, the time of night being spent, sommoned their watchfull eyes to sleep, wherefore after many solemne Adues, taken one of the other, they hastened on all sides to their rest, onely Diphilus and the Princesse best content, she joying in her Love, and Kingly Brothers liking, and he blessing a million of times the day wherein he first saw the Prince, procurer of his so great good. What other imaginations assailed them, let those suppose and thinke which have felt the sweet content in Love. To which J leave them, to recount vnto you the sorrow of the Trebisond Queene who ruling with honour, beloved both of Peeres and Commons, in as much royalty as might be desired, endured so many sundry torments of mind, wanting her most desire, that the day was irkesome vnto her and the night ordained for rest, restlesse she consumed, that with her continuall watchings and other passions, her body became weake, and a grievous sicknesse assailed her, the cause no man could imagine, neither might Physick minister any cure to her disease: so that given over to death, she languished in great extremities, not daring for modesty, to reveale the cause, onely this was her chiefest comfort, when she could be freed from the copany of such Ladies and Counsellers, which visited her, with Syritha to recount her love, sometime extolling his valour and person, and eftsoones accusing him of disloyalty, exclaiming on her hard Fortune which had engaged her liberty to a Knight carelesse of her honour and good, cursing and accusing Syritha , being soliciter for such a wretched Knight, whose speeches oftentimes was so answered by the Maiden Syritha , as in jesting wise would she turne her words of despight into laughter, such was the sharpenesse of her wit, which left no meanes vnsought, that might procure in the least manner her content. Oppressed with griefe (we leave the Princesse for a while) to returne vnto Diphilus , whose Wedding day being come, great was the joy on his side, but more the preparation of all Courtiers, who were ready with many costly showes, at the Tilt, Turney, and Barriers, to try their valour and fortunes in Armes. But as the fairest day is overcast with cloudes, so was their mirth changed to great and grievous lamentations, and their joy to sorrowfull complaints, which thus befell. The King now in prime of yeares, desirous to try his force at the Tilt with his presence, to honour his Nobles, and doe the Princesse favour at her Marriage in these pastimes, made choyce of Loves Heroick Champion , to encounter him as the worthyest in Armes, who being of all others most vnwilling to deale against him, humbly besought his Grace of pardon, and accept of some of his Nobles who was worthier of that honour. But the King, with whom no intreaties might prevaile, would not be denyed, which made the Knight with great heavinesse of heart, to wish he had not armed him that day, such was his discontented mind, which doubtlesse presaged some great ensuing evill, as to the great griefe of all the whole company hapned them. Thus when no denials might prevaile, the Trumpets sounding a charge, they set forwards with such swiftnesse, as the earth trembled vnder their horses, both breaking their staves in such manner, as all the company with joyfull shoutes applauded their excellent skill in that exercise. But alas (in midst of this pleasing practise) how suddainly their joyes were eclipsed, woe is me to recount. The King and his elected Companion, at the Trumpets sound, setting with courage forward to encounter one the other, in brave manner brake againe their staves, but in an vnhappy time, a splinter of the Knights staffe, by most vnfortunate chance (entred the sight of the Kings Beaver) which pierced the head to the braine, in such wise, that with the heate of his trauaile and griefe of the wound, he was enforced to forsake his horse. This suddaine mishap to the company brought such discontent, that all their mirth was laid apart,  & sorrow was Lady of the feast. But amongst those that most lamented this vnfortunate chance, Loves Heroick Champion had his part, whose griefe was such, that had not the Lord Diphilus beene by fortune present, in the extreame of his melancholy passion he had slaine himself: such was the wisdome of the Noble Diphilus , whose reasonable perswasions prevailed so with him, as hee caused him forsake his dolefull Lodge, to accompany him to the presence of the King whose masters of Chirurgery had newly ended the travaile of dressing his wounds, them the Knight questioned of the danger thereof, and besought them in curtesie to acquaint him therewith, whether he held it mortall or no, which how vnwilling soever they were, as loth to discomfort the King or those which loved him, such was the courteous entreaty of the Knight, as he could not conceale the danger thereof, but revealed vnto him the little hopes they had of his life, and the reasons that induced them therevnto, which newes was little pleasing vnto the Knight, who with many teares lamented the mishap, but griefe ministreth no Physicke to the diseased, nor sorrow availeth not to mittigate extreames. Wherefore by Diphilus comforted, he ceaseth in so exceeding manner to lament, determining to abide the Kings doome, vnto whom he purposeth to reconcile himselfe, and to that intent awaiteth the waking of his Majesty, who was after his dressing fallen a sleepe, whose griefe was such as he could take small rest. But rowsing himselfe, awaked from slumber, called for the Lord Diphilus , who was waiting onely for the same purpose, vnto whom being come, he saith; Diphilus , let no man boast himselfe of happinesse, which is mortall, for that they are subject to crosses, and casuall mishaps, as thy selfe maist witnesse with me, and many others that have seen this mischance befallen me, when I least expected it, the originall of my griefe proceeding from my selfe, which would perforce my good friend to the action whervnto he was so vnwillingly drawn but what Heavens have ordained, what man can gaine-say? The Omnipotent power of the Almighty, hath layd his crosse on me for my greater good, to call me from these worlds vanities, to seeke his everlasting Kingdome; Yet ere I leave this fraile life, sweet Diphilus , let me see that honorable Knight, by whose hands death sent his sommons, deare he was vnto me, and his love worthy to be imbraced of the mightiest Monarch. Oh Marianus , couldest thou but imagine with what faithfull love I loved thee, thou maist sorrow for my losse, whom thou and all the world cannot reclaime from this great hazard wherein I remaine, with this the Knight which was not farre off, presented himselfe vnto him, who kneeling at his beds side, said; Most gracious Soveraigne, might my grieved heart which overwhelmed in sorrow; is sowced in a Sea of many miseries consume it selfe with griefe, for my evill committed against you, how happy a creature were I, which have beene the occasion of your Highnesse so great vnrest, yet how vnwilling, Heavens record with me? And therefore (my dread Soveraigne, pardon my fault, so vnwillingly committed against your Majesty, as deare to me as mine owne soule, whose life, if ten thousand lives depended thereon, I wish might be sacrificed for thy health, and the loving Subjects of my gracious Soveraigne, whom by my overhardinesse, I have robbed of so loving a Prince, Let me I say, chiefe causer of your sorrow, reape the guerdon due to a murtherer, and revenge your Kings death, by taking my life, which had I a million of thousand lives, could not make satisfaction for my evill committed against you. Here teares interrupting him, denying his tongue liberty of speech, whose lamentation filled all the Nobles with such heavinesse, as for teares, they could not vtter a word especially the King, whose griefe being great, was increased by his dolefull lament, yet casting off this womanish humour, drying his eyes, doubting the Nobles and those present should accuse him of feare, (dreading to dye) whereunto we all are borne, with a soft voyce tenderly wringing Loves Heroick Champion by the hand, he saith; Noble Gentleman, cease thy heavinesse, thy griefe so augments mitte, that the thought thereof wrings teares from my heart; thy vnwilling offence with my heart I forgive, and to shew how deare in life thou wast vnto me, (my good Marianus ) accept at my dying hand, my Kingdome of Hungaria ; the lawfull inheritance of thy faithfull friend, love those people my kind Subjects, and so governe them with favour and lenity, as they have no cause to complaine of my dead corpes, and for my life, which by thy hand, through the appointment of him that gave it me, I must leave, I heartily forgive thee, and accursed be he or them which shal ever impute vnto thee, in dishonor any fault against me comitted. That ye lovest me, thy tender care of my good hath shewed such proofes, as tyed me in true friendship to be thine for ever. Death is not so irkesome unto me, but that I must leave thee,  & the sweet content I received in thy company, griefe of my deaths griefe, my owne Marianus , compelleth me to omit what I would say, wherefore briefly thus; Forget not thy dying friend, and shew that love to the Lord Diphilus , whom for thy sake, I have to this Crowne of Æ gypt advanced, as I ever found, and in extreames comfort him with thy ayd as thou hast done me: My Sister Timoclea forget not, whom to thy charge I commit (leaving her to thee) and thee to be in my place a brother, who living loved her, as my hope is thou wilt. And so deare friends (Heavens blessednesse befall you all)  & so prosper you, as I loved you. And you Peeres of Æ gypt and Hungaria , whose love I have found as Subjects in all dutifull manner, let be continued vnto these your elected Kings, who will with honour governe you, so shall the giver of all happinesse blesse you and your lands, with the blessing of peace and plenty: for they that honour their King, doth reverence the Lord who created him, and he will give them plenteous rewards. Noble Gentlemen, griefe curteth me off, flesh must yeeld to earth how loath soever the mightiest, death hath vanquished. Therefore as my Vltimum vale , remember my words, and pray God to send vs the abundance of his grace, that we may through his mercy, have a joyfull meeting in his Kingdome that never shall have end. I feele the heavy messenger approaching therfore Farewell to thee my deare Sister, whom I charge as thou lovedst me living, be loving and kind to thy husband, doing him that honour is due vnto him, thy children bring vp in feare of their Maker, and so God blesse thee with happinesse. And thou Marianus vnto me no creature in life more deare remember my parting speeches, love the Lord Diphilus , as I have loved thee, and thou my adopted brother Diphilus honour him during thy life, that I am sure faithfully tendered and loved thee, so shall God be pleased, for no sin in sight of his divine Deity, is more intollerable, then that monstrous vice of ingratitude which for avoyding the heavy wrath of God, I wish thee to eschew Nobles and you all my good friends, to exhort you, to remeber your duties, whose wisdome is more then I will recount, were a matter frivolous, and perhaps may move some offence, yet take my simple meaning (which speake to you that have over loved me) which love let be continued; Honour your Kings with reverence and love, for what you doe to them is done to God , which are his Vize-regents on earth, and his annoynted: Move no rebellion nor be maintainers of evill, for such faults, how secret soever, God will to your overthrows reveale. Remember his word which hath commanded you to be obedient, without murmuring, and feare him which governeth all. I can say no more, my speech faileth me, therefore generally my Lords, Farewell: and so turning his weake body to the wall, surrendred his soule to the Heavens, from whence it had his being, to the intollerable griefe of all his Subjects, who with many brinish teares lamented his death, but especially the Knight Marianus and Diphilus , whose Marriage the loving King honoured with his Funerall, which in the most honourablest manner, Art or honour could devise, was solemnized, lamented generally of all his Subjects, but especially the Æ gyptians who more dearely loved him for his clemency, then their owne naturall King.  How Loves Heroick Champion , having settled the King Diphilus in his Kingdomes, well furnished with a Fleet of gallant Galleyes arrived in Trebisond , and was welcomed of the Lord high Admirall Remnius , who met him in the Harbour.  Heroick Champion so prevailed with the Nobles of Hungaria and Æ gypt , that by common consent of the whole Assembly in both houses, temporall and spirituall, the Regiments of both Kingdomes was deliuered vnto the Lord Diphilus , and Loves Heroick Champion resigned his interest for ever to him and the Lady, who was lawfull inheritrix vnto the same. The Parliament prorogued according to the custome of the Countrey, great preparation was made for the Coronation, which in most solemne and honourable manner was accomplished, with so many sundry shewes  & delightfull pleasures, as might weary you to read. Let it suffice, to the great joy of both Realmes, all things to so honorable an action, was so exquisitly performed, as no man but took great delight in beholding thereof, praying with an universall voice, for their long lives, to be in happinesse amongst them continued. Thus all things to the joy of the Noble Marianus accomplisht, and to the high content of the King Diphilus , and his Queen by the advise of Loves Heroick Champion , an election was made of a Vizeroy to goe for Hungaria , the King making choyce of two evils the least, conceiving this opinion of the naturall subjects of Hungaria , that they would live in their dutifull obeysance, when a conquered Nation gathering head vpon many light occasions, was easily drawne to revolt. These considerations with great wisedome weyed, the Lord Ferdinand , one of the Privie Councell of Hungaria , was elected for that governmet, vnto whom the King after his Commission signed, and honourable gifts given, so wisely exhorted to obedience, and care of his love and duty, that as many of the Nobles as were present, and noted the same, admired him, rejoycing that God had provided so for them, to leave them in the government of so toward a Prince, of whom so much ensuing happinesse was expected. Order taken for his affaires of weight, the Vizeroy enbarqued for Hungaria , and his Nobles departed, each one vnto their severall Mansions, saving such of his privie Councell, which were attendant at the Court. The Noble Marianus , was now to take his leaue, the very remembrance whereof, was more offensive to the King and Queen, then all their former troubles. Bootlesse it was to intreat his longer stay, who standing on thornes till his desire was obtained, in beholding the most beautifull Princesse, might no longer be perswaded: wherefore the King to honor him the more, by whom he was for ever honoured, caused a Fleet to be prepared of twenty Galleyes, whom by his strickt commandement, was most royally furnished with all needfull vyands, and other necessaries for his voyage, which on such suddaine was purveyed, as might well shew their diligence to whom that great charge was committed. All things ready for his departure, and a faire winde blowing a fresh and comfortable gale, these friends were now to depart. After leave taken of the Princesse, who with many brinish teares bewayled the same, the King with his Peeres accompanied him to the water side, where his company appoynted to attend him, awaited his comming, where after heavie parting on both sides, and many teares spent of the commons which beheld their sorrowes, he imbarqued himselfe, and by the good favour of the winds, and diligent industry of his Marriners, suddainly lost sight of land, and had the wind so favourable, that in short time they attained sight of the high land of Trebisond with which they did beare all that they might, yet could not possibly recover their Port that night. This Fleet of Gallyes being on the shore discryed, none could imagine what they were or should be, to prevent the worst, the Councell carefull of their owne safeties, and commons good, assembled the power of their City, making provision for defence, what ever happened. The Master of the Admirall, not daring to enter the Harbour by night, lay off againe into the Sea, hulling vntill the day watch was in land, at which time, they set Sayle to goe for their Harbour, and by favourable assistance of the winds, recovered the same. After the Sunne had shewed her selfe in her beauty two houres, to survey which power, and give notice to the Queen what they were, the Lord Remnius , Lord high Admirall of the land, was in a Frygot sent, who boughing as much as the force of his staues would permit him: being a man honourable and venturous, not knowing what they were, whether friends or enemies, came vp with the Admirall, and layd her aboord, of whose comming, Loves Heroick Champion being advertised, doing him duty, caused his Flagge to be furled, and his Ancient to be taken downe, whose order the whole Fleet followed. When the Admirall saw the Knight Marianus , whose welfare they greatly doubted. betweene them was much rejoycing and many imbracings, as friends joyfull to see one the other. passing in pleasant parley the time, they come to Anchor, at which time according to directions given by the Knight, all their Ordnance was discharged, with their small Artillery rejoycing according to the Sea manner, for their safe arrivall, to the great admiration of all the beholders, which could imagine no certaine what they were: no sooner was the Anchors a ground, but the Lord Admirall causing his Frygot to come aboord, entered the same, accompanied with Loves Heroick Champion , and other Nobles of Hungaria and Æ gypt , which came to accompany him, as Ambassadours from the King, who were all most royally entertained of the Nobles, which attended their landing, and were conducted to the Court, where according to their estates they were sumptuously lodged in the Court, and like order taken for purveying for their traine. Amongst others that had enquired the newes of these strangers, and what they were, Syritha by chance, as women are inquisitive of novelties, had with diligence learned what those Nobles so royally entertained were, with the arrivall of Loves Heroick Champion , who was no sooner known vnto the joyfull Mayden, (made more joyfull by these happy tydings) but standing on thorns vntill she came to the presence of the Queen, doubting least her newes should be so stale before she came, as it would be scarce worth the carriage, she omitted no time. To whom being come, and finding the Queen in her accustomed melancholy passions, though now some way otherwise imployed about the imaginations of these strangers, to put her from her study, thus said. What Madam, ever in your memento , in faith were I of your privie Councell, and might perswade with you, J would wish your Majesty become Lady of some Nunnery, where you might have company, since nothing may delight you but contemplation. Syritha , quoth the Queen, cease thy fond talke at this time, and give me leave, who have matters of weight to imploy me on. If it be so Madame, (quoth Syritha ) am to crave pardon for my boldnesse, otherwise, if it might not have beene offensive, I could have acquainted your highnesse with some newes of Loves Heroick Champion , which because J see it is troublesome vnto you having businesse, J beseech your grace licence me to depart, vntill it shall please your Ladiship to find leisure to heare me. The Queen hearing her name Loves Heroick Champion , was so waked from her dumps, as she called Syritha , and with earnest intreaties besought her to let her know, what newes she had heard of these strangers, and what moved her to name Loves Heroick Champion . Madame, (quoth Syritha ) if your Ladiship would have permitted me to speake, I had without farther delaies, acquainted you with such newes of these strangers, as I heare, and have diligently enquired, who are Nobles of Hungaria , in Ambassage for the King, accompanied with the best welcomed Knight in Affrica . The peerlesse Marianus , your Graces sworne Servant, the naming of whom, so revived the Queene, that he that had the word sight might have perceived how pleasing these newes were vnto her, yet doubtfull of her Maydens speeches, which had deluded her, to move delight, she said; Syritha , thou hast had more pleasure in feeding me with vain hopes, then hath contented me; yet have I borne thy follies, iamgining in what sort they were vsed. But now Syritha , leave thy Jests, least they grow odious, and move me to choller against thee, which would nor willingly be drawne vnto. Therefore tell me without dallying, is my Knight arrived with these Nobles, or is there certaine tydings of his good health by these strangers. Madame (quoth Syritha ,) if my over-boldnesse have incurred your displeasure, J humbly crave pardon, who had no intent to offend, hee witnesse with me, which searcheth my deepest secrets, but to assure you of what you so much desire, know Madame, Loves Heroick Champion is with these Nobles arrived, who as I heare, are come from the Lord Diphilus , who by procurement of Loves Heroick Champion , is married with the Princesse of Hungaria , and is royally Crowned by consent of both Realmes, lawfull King of Hungaria and Æ gypt , the one, his Queens lawfull inheritance the other, the late Kings request, who by vnhappy fortune, hath left this life. Thus Madame have J acquainted your Highnesse with what I have heard, the truth thereof being proved, I hope will procure my pardon. Syritha (quoth the Queene) ten thousand times I thanke thee for thy tydings, which I will so requite, as it shall be the best newes that ever passed thy mouth, to give thee some assurance thereof, take this Diamond, which she pulling off from her finger, delivered it her, and looke for a better reward. The hasty approaching of the Councell, interrupting their speech, caused them cease their farther parley, who staying the Queens pleasure, sent her word, they had some matter to impart vnto her, who were presently admitted to her presence accompanied with Loves Heroick Champion . The Councell having done their duties, Loves Heroick Champion presented himselfe vnto her Majesty, whose sight so appalled her as she could say nothing, shamefast modesty striving with her willingnesse to bid him welcome, which she could not doe as she would, least her countenance should disclose her hearts desire, yet not omitting such honourable favour as she could doe him, she offered her hand to kisse, which in all humblenesse he accepted, acknowledging his most bounden duty vnto her highnesse, whom she questioned in this manner. Servant, quoth she, we had thought your liking had been such to the Dames of Hungaria as we should have beene invited to your Wedding, or that your entertainment had been so evill in our Court, as you were weary of the same, that you have thus long absented your wife from your presence, (vnder Benedicite ) Servant, as you owe duty to your Mistresse, make me your Ghostly Father, and before my Lords here present, tell me and dissemble not, what hath been the cause of your long stay. Gracious Soveraigne, quoth the Knight, if I answer what is truth. J hope your Majesty will accept it, and pardon me, if in my harsh answer I passe those duties which I would not willingly doe. For my love to forrain Ladies, I may justly deny, which neither saw any since my departure from your confines, in whose presence I took pleasure: During my long stay, how vnwilling that hath been, I call to record these Noble strangers which can testifie my long desire to have tendered my dutifull service unto your highnesse, whereunto I am bound. Therefore dread Lady, pardon my offence therein, who being at a forraigne Princes commandement, must obey it. Well Servant, quoth the Queene, J must give credit to your words, else should I doe you wrong, but howsoever, you are welcome to your Mistresse, who is a debtor of yours. The sight of this Noble Physitian, wrought more effects then all the Medicines Art could minister, whose presence quite expelled all former cares from her Princely heart, though her body weakened with her long languishing, could not be so suddainly restored. But time, and short time, with the comfort she conceived of her loving Prince, restored her to her former health, as you shall heare in the ensuing History. Now returne we to the Nobles, who awaited her Highnesse pleasure, for which the Queen leaving of her speech with the Knight, thus said; Honourable Lords, if it be mo matter of counsell, for which your comming is at this time, let vs know the cause, my Servant I dare commit some trust vnto, who shall participate of these your affaires, Mightiest Princesse, (quoth the Lord Timarchus ,) matter of state concerning the government or affaires, of your Common weale, we have not to vtter, but onely doe beseech your Highness to command for your honour, that these noble strangers be entertained according to their estates, with such curtesie and bounty, that they may have cause to speake of your Court and honourable entertainment, as of a worthy deserving Prince. And more, to doe your Noble Subjects honour, the Lord Diphilus , who by Marriage of the deceased Kings Sister, is Crowned lawfull King both of Hungaria and Æ gypt . This is all most gracious Lady, whereof if you please to conceiue, and give order for the same accordingly, you shall highly honour vs your Subjects, and gaine to your selfe the famous report of strangers, which is the garment that beautifieth Princes, and governours of States. Thankes Noble Gentlemen (quoth the Queene,) for your honourable care of vs, wch are not acquainted with any such matters, wherefore I beseech you my Lord Timarchus ; to keep them company during their stay here, let my Officers attend them, and their allowance be such, as may not impaire our bountifull mind thereby to deserve honour, (if feasting be honourable) especially let their traine be well purveyed for both in large allowance of vyands and lodging, for those are they by whom fame will ring, being of the baser sort, either of honour, or dishonor, as for their Ambassage, we will omit hearing, vntill God endue vs with some more strenth, and so farewell. The Nobles having done their duties and gone, It may be imagined, whether the Knight departed with consent or no, on whom the Queen bestowed so gracious a looke, as he might well judge of his welcome, but command his longer stay she would not, to avoid the suspition of jealousie, or that her love would be in the least sort suspected. Content with the sight of her beloved, after their departure, commanding the rest of the company from her, detaining onely Syritha , between them began some pleasant parley, wherin, first the Queene, and then Syritha , descanted at their pleasure of the Knight, omitting no jesture he vsed in his speech, his person, and what else greatly delighted the Princesse, who would often say, how mannerly is my servant become? Yea quoth Syritha , it is hard to say, whether he learned the same of man or woman, nay on my word, quoth the Princesse, I dare acquit him, for any company keeping with women, is Maydenly blush, assureth me that he hath learned no courting fashions of the Hungarian Ladies, ( Credo ) quoth Syritha , and Madame so ever beleeve, for a good beliefe, is a step to salvation, or by my hollidome, your chiefest Chaplin is not so just a man as he ought to be. Thus pleasantly discoursing, we leave them, to recount vnto you the royall entertainment of the Hungarian Nobles and their traine. The Lord Timarchus , to whom the Queen had delivered this charge as you have heard, tooke such care in performance thereof, that as he was Noble, and every way endued with honorable conditions, so was his care, in discharge of that trust committed vnto him, as the Nobles admired their royall cheere, their diversity of sports to beguile time, with costly showes, each accident so exquisitely performed, as the thoughts and imaginations thereof, moved those strange Nobles, when the company had left them to their rests, in contemplating of their gracious entertainment, to consume sometime the most of the night, admiring the bounty of the Queen, whom they with earnest minds desired to see. As these Nobles consumed their time with pleasure, which made it seeme the shorter, so the Queen which had care for receiving their message, after the first sight of her Servant, began so to comfort her selfe, that with those comfortable confections her Doctors provided, and receiving such vyands as Physick thought most meetest, she began to recover her decayed colour, and her faint Limbs over weake with forbearing such sustenance, wherwith nature should be relieved, recovered their strength in such wise, as it joyed her Subjects to heare of her recovery. Time which overcommeth mighty things, hath brought the Queen to that good estate, as finding a day wherein the Sunnes power, vanquished the ayres rumatick coldnesse, she walked into the Garden, where she solaced her selfe, beholding Natures abiliments, which beautified the earth in such manner, that the pleasantnesse thereof, with the sweet smells, bred her great content.  How the Knight wayting opportunity met the Queene in her Garden of pleasure, and their parley, and what happened betweene the Knight and Syritha .  her royall highnesse, hearing this happy tydings, hasteneth to the Garden, whom the Queen no sooner saw, but calling him vnto her, after his duty done and her Majesty, taking him vp from the ground from of his knee, she said; My Lord, what excuse can you frame now, for neglecting you duty to your Mistresse, which cannot have your sight being in Court, without a messenger, in the sight of any one attending vs, be offensive vnto your Grace, we will remove them, rather then loose your company, so we may know them. Noble Princesse, answered the Knight, that I acknowledge not my duty as I ought, pardon me, and weigh me in the ballance of your gracious clemency, my zeale and heartie desire to doe you service: who albeit my heart desireth no such happinesse as your Princely presence, yet knowing that Princes have many eyes to behold them, and Envie lurketh in the hearts of Subjects, who imagining more then is on either of our parts thoughts, may with their evill speech raise that scandall, as may blemish your renowne being a Vergin, and procure my greater trouble, which am a stranger. Cleanly excused, quoth the Queene, I see now good servant, you have not spent your time idlely abroad, if I might know your Schoole Mistresse, J would be so bold to thanke her, for the diligent applying her Scholler. Madam, quoth the Prince, J am glad to heare your Grace so well disposed, I hope your Majesty having recovered strength, and your businesse with these Nobles overpast, will thinke of your servant, and remember your word to me, which challengeth the same at your Majesties hands. My Lord (quoth she) had I not held thy Love in regard, I could not have denied the many sutes of my Peeres and Commons which have besought me, and with great earnestnesse entreated me to Marriage, but so deare hath thy love been unto me, that I desired death rather then falsifie my Faith to your Grace, for whom, and through whose unkindnesse, I have endured much hearts discontent. No more of that quoth the Knight (good Madame) expell from your mind passed griefes, and thinke upon the ensuing pleasures which will exceed all the discontent hath been: to heare your discontent is little pleasing unto me, who never closed those eyes, nor never beheld the rising of the glorious Sunne, without millions of times remembring your Grace, whose presence I more desired then I will explaine. Syritha seeing some of the Councell entering the Garden, gave them intelligence thereof, breaking off their speech thus; Sir, if you have taken orders in holy Church since your departure, it is more then is expected of all the Court, which in time past have shewed your selfe so worthily in Armes to your lasting honour. If you have, and her Grace have chosen you for her Ghostly Father, enjoyne J beseech you, her Majesty to some easie pennance, for her long sicknesse is not to endure much fasting; besides, here is of the Councell who hath waited to say something, either to the Queene or your Grace. These words of Syritha , caused them surcease their talke, and with shewes of loving countenances, to give each other the Farewell. The Knight framing his talke to Syritha , who finding him alone, thus said: Sir, experience of mine own discontent hath taught me, what a corrosive Melancholy is to a pleasant mind, who in your absence have endured many sharpe words: yea, and oftentimes those thundering speeches, lighting with blowes either on my ribbes, head, or face (in revenge of which) had you bin present for whose sake I endured them, I should have adventured the cracking of a sword with your Grace, or greatly have wanted of my will. Why how now Syritha (quoth the Knight) art thou metamorphosed? Hath the Goddesse joyned thee abiliments of a man, as well as armed thy heart with courage? (Faire wench) art thou so valiantly minded to breake a Blade? Take heed, 'tis dangerous for you to deale with weapons, but I will desire the Queene to search you, least happily as bad a chance befall her Maides, as Dania which entertained Iupiter in likenesse of a Swan; If Syritha be likewise by their consents alienated from her sexe, is were good to prevent evils in time, had I wist, commeth too late. My Lord (quoth Syritha ) blushing with shame, your Lordship hath through my fondnesse taken me at advantage, misconstruing my simple meaning, which have ever honoured you: Conceale my folly in this good my Lord,  & forget it, and pardon my fond words, which have felt many stripes for you. Nay Syritha (quoth the Knight) I may not with mine honour let passe a matter of such importance, without revealing it unto her Highnesse, least your words (as you say) spoken in jeast turne some of our Ladies in earnest to be beholden to mother Midwife. The Queene which had reposed her selfe with beholding the beauty of Nature, and taken the pleasant ayre which did greatly comfort her, having some conference with her Nobles, departed the Garden, which made the rest with all the speed they could make to follow; whereof Syritha was nothing sorrowfull, who was thereby compeld to leave the Knight, of whom she wished long before to have shift her hands. The Queen gathering some strength, was loath to detaine the strange Nobles any longer from her Presence: wherefore by her Nobles she limited a time to heare them, against which day were all her Nobles summoned to be at Court, with her Ladies (and women of most account) to attend her Majesty, who with the Lord Steward of her houshold had taken such order for all diversity of vyands that might be provided. The day appointed come, not unexpected of the strangers, who provided themselves as sumptuous as they could, apparelled after their Country manner, attended the time of her Majesties comming foorth, who being come, and in her Chayre of Estate seated, word was brought unto the strangers, who marching with the Nobles of Trebisond through the Court, were in most honorable maner presented unto her Majesty, who with countenance debonnaire and grace Majesticall, as became her royalty, bad them all welcome in such curteous and Princely manner that the strangers at this first sight were driven to great admiration, beholding that Grace and honour in a Woman, which they would never have beleeved, had not their eyes beene witnesses. The Queen having given them these honorable welcomes, each man taking his place. Phereclus , the chiefest in Comission for their King, thus said; Magnificent Prince, our King, your Highnesse late Subject, acknowledging his humble duty to your Excellence, hath sent vs his Liegemen and sworn Servants, to signifie the same; who in faithfull love voweth, never to be alienated in mind from that duty, which becommeth each naturall Subject to owe his Prince and Country. By vs he presents his offer and service, which shall be with all his power ready, at your Highnesse pleasure; the rest his honourable Letters shall import, which humbly kissing, on their knees, they delivered into her Princely hands, who returned many thanks to their King for his love, with like to them, which had vouchsafed that travell (to see her Court and Presence) beseeching them to take in worth a Maydens entertainment in doing which, she should think herselfe much beholding vnto them. With pleasant parley and discoursing With pleasant parley and discoursing of sundry matters and questions by the Queene propounded, touching their Countries, they passed their time untill Dinner, not without great admiration of the strangers which beheld her stately Grace, her sumptuous attire, the duty and honour done by her Nobles and Ladies, which with their costly apparell and most rare excellence in Beauty greatly delighted them. The time of Dinner drawing neere, the tables covered and all things prepared for the same, the Queene taking her place, the Ambassadors were likewise placed at another table in her presence. The manner of her service with the diversity of vyands of all sorts was such, as they could hardly beleeve, so many sundry kinds of Fowle, fish, and other cheere for them prepared, were to be found in the limits of the earth. Thus with great delight being welcommed by her Highnes, they spent their time untill the end of Dinner, still admiring the Majesty of her Grace, which so honorably bare her, as no Prince in her time could compare with her. Dinner ended, the Queene curteously bidding those strangers welcome, she was conducted by her Nobles into a Gallery, which for beautifull shewes with rare Pictures and devices of rich price, was so adorned as the strangers had never seene the like. Not long had they passed the time in noting those glorious devises, but the Courtiers who had provided themselves to doe her Highnes honour, and cause her delight, which had so long time withdrawne her self from all pleasures: Armed in all parts with each man his severall device, they entred the yard appointed of custome for the Tilt, where a window opening fro the Gallery, the Queene with the strangers were set to behold these pastimes. The whole company come, each one for honour of her Grace, delivered his Scuchion of device unto her Princely hands. Where Gentiles suppose you, that know Ladies praises, or dispraises, what happened. Where to beguile the time, was each device by the Queene and her Ladies, surveyed with such vigilant eies, as nothing was unremembred, every one giving judgement according to that affection they bare the presenter. While they were thus discanting, & the Marshall with the Iudges, appointing each man in his degree to try himselfe; Behold, a pretty Page, mounted on a light running Courser, with his guide before him, winding his Horne in poasting manner, comming neare the place where the Queen was, alighted from his horse, & being of height answerable, to deliver his Letters wth his hand, putting them on his wand, (after his duty done) humbly kissing them, he delivered the vnto her Majesties hand, wth the Queen perusing, question'd him if he had ought else to impart? Who answered. Most famous Princesse, my Lord and Master, hearing of this assembly which Fame hath bruted, to the honour of this Royall company, and high commendations of these Nobles hath sent (as not daring to approach the place without their lawfull favour obtained) who for honour of his Mistresse, which he affirmeth and will maintaine) to be the most exquisite Lady for all perfections in ye confines of the earth: he offereth at the Tilt, with each gain sayer, to breake sixe staves. If there be any such that will accept his challenge in maintaining his Mistresses honour, let me know him who shall soone be answered. The Page being vnknowne, the Nobles wondered what he might be, which without exception had made this challenge, imagining that he was some man of valor, and that it were discurtesie to deny a man at Arms whatsoever. Thereon generally concluding they returned him by the Page, this answer. Page, though thy Masters peremptory chalenge, deserve rather to be maligned then accepted, yet such is the Nobility of Trebisond , as honoring Arms  & all professors therof, accept the same, and where we had appointed every one his companion, we are content to temit that election, and to bend all our force to his dishonour, and so to him vnknowne, commend vs, whom wee intreat to Arme suddainely, and speed him hither. The Page receiving this answer of the Nobles, the Queen calling him, which mounted, was ready to depart, said; Sir Boy, to thy vnknowne Knight commend vs, whom we thanke for vouchsafing vs that honour his Letters import, which our Nobilitie have (without any sure of mine accepted) of whom we shall find men endowed with courage. The Page departed, sundry were the imaginations what the Knight might be, who had offered them this proud challenge, in midst whereof, a Trumpet sounding, they expected the Challenger, who entred Armed in all parts, with black Armour which was garnisht with many wounded Harts, on the brest a Lady with a cloth of fine Lawne whipping them, over spreading as many as she could reach with a scarff carnation coloured, his word (in Greeke dispaire not) pacing on with easie paces, according to the vse of the place, coming nere that end of the Tilt, which was opposite with the Queenes Window, vayling his head to her Majesty, she graciously bad him welcome, shaking her hand. Long had he not stayd but the Lord Marshall in like manner, with show of great curtesie bad him welcome, and desired him to prepare himselfe for the defendants attended him. My Lord (quoth the Knight) at their good pleasures, when they shall put themselves forward at the Trumpets sound I will meet them. Thus warning given them, without longer stay the Lord Pomarius , his Copartner in Hungaria , set forward, whom Loves Heroick Champion met with such force, as his feet were too big for his stirrops, and he likely to have taken a more disgrace being vnhorsed. This first encounter was noted of all the Nobles, who commended his stregth regarded him nothing, but with such valour met him, that he made him to his great disgrace, forsake the Saddle, at which a generall showt (to the Knights great commendations) was given. The Lord Pomarius (having had his part) another came in place, who went not away without some disgrace, so generally behaved he himselfe and with such honour and valour bare him, that the Judges, Fathers of Armes, gave the honour of the day to him, whom they all (though a stranger) highly commended, The Knight comming before the Queen, humbly doing his duty, was with his Trumpet sounding ready to depart, whom the Nobles would not suffer without his knowledge, beseeching him not so much to dishonor them of whom he had deserved honour, in such manner to leave them. Loves Heroick Champion , who would as willingly have revealed himselfe, as they desired, though he made show of some discontent, yet would not deny their request, but calling for his Armorer, opened his Beaver, who being known to be Loves Heroick Champion , they were all the more honoured, taking no disgrace to be foyled of him, by whose hands so many had lost their lives, who were honourable and expert in Armes. Being discovered, he presented himselfe to her Majesty, who not a little joyfull of her Servants good fortune, whom she graced in this manner. Servant (qd, she) thanks for your pains, and honouring vs at this time, for which I ensure you, I think my selfe much beholding; it had been pitty, truant-like you should have left these honorable Lords your friends without having acknowledged you selfe vnto vs and them, who you shal see will be carefull to procure a Surgion, who doubtlesse shall cure those bleading hearts, if any such there be of skill in Trebisond . Honored Lady (quoth the Knight) the well-spring of curtesie and Nobility most humble thanks I yeeld your Majesty for this Grace, without whose favour and grace, to whom in duty I am so bounden, I desire not life. This said, the Queen and the strange Nobles departing, supper being ready and they set, their Table talke was of the brave behaviour of the Knight, who had all the honor attributed to him, that was to be required, wherein the strangers were joyed, loving him dearly, and to increase the Fame which generally was given him, they in presence of the whole assembly, declared the honours her Majesties Champion had gained in Hungaria and Æ gypt , with the death of their King, who of a wound by his hand at the Tilt dyed: leaving nothing vnspoken, which might any way honour him, whereof the Queen joyed not a little, though she concealed the same. Supper being ended, and some part of the night spent in dancing, masking, and other Court-like pastimes: the Queen commending the Nobles to their rests, bad the company good night, who entring her lodging, it might have joyed the heart of any Lady in love, to heare the generall laud of the Ladies, given to Loves Heroick Champion , of whom no other talk was to be heard, each honorable part in him commended to his desart, and of his valor in Armes, no praise was sufficient: wherewith the Queen was not a little pleased, nor Syritha discontent, to heare the onely prize of honour given her Lord, by whom she had hope for her passed service to be preferred. Thus joying on all parts, we leave the Queen with her company to their rests, and returne to the noble strangers, whose commendations and honorable reports of the Knight was such, that nothing could be more pleasing vnto them, applauding the wisedome and noble demeanour of the Queen, whose like in her time, was not as they supposed to be found: with such sundry discourses, passed these Nobles the night, to which we leave them for a time. These Princely pastimes overpast, the care of the Queen was for dispatch of the Nobles of Hungaria , whom she was loth to detain, from that desire they had to see their coutry. Wherfore, after some two or three dayes spent in discoursing of their Countries, and state of their Realms, with the commodities thereof. eftsoones enterlacing their discourses, with some pleasant parley, wherein the Nobles were much delighted, the Queen took order with her Counsell for their answer, limiting a time therfore, to the good content of the strangers. Against which prefixed time, the Queen having care of her honourable word, had their Letters all written and signed, when omitting them to a Banquet, shee in such honourable manner delivered their answer, with such words of love, and desire of good to their King as overcome with joyes thereof, the strangers were not able long-time to answer, presenting their King and Queen with gifts of high esteem, and highly rewarding their honourable paines, which they gratefully accepted, taking order for Galleys with victualls, and other necessaries, to be purveyed with speed and bounty. This honorable entertainment of the Queen to those strangers, being in the prime of her government, gained her such honor through their reports, that those which heard the same, admired her, whom they imagined was Peerlesse, for Wisdome, bounty, and curtesie, not omitting the favour and love of the Nobility, of whose worthinesse, they could never speake sufficient.  How the Nobles of Hungaria , having received great favours and graces from the Queene and her Nobility, departed. The Queene summoned a Parliament, in which the State doth consent that she marry Loves Heroick Champion , and is Crowned King and Queene of Trebisond and Carmania .  to whom the provision of the Fleet was commended, was such, that there was no wants in short time left vnfurnished, that lacking nothing but a faire wind, which he that commandeth wind and Seas, sent in such happy time as they could wish, which not willing to loose, they commend the health and happy government of the Queene, to him that ruleth all. And so accompanied with Loves Heroick Champion , who was loth to leave them, and many other Peeres of the land, they were conducted each one to his severall Galley, where being embarqued, their Sayles cut, and they afore the wind, they gave their farewell, with such a brave ringing peale of great Canons, and then likewise their small Artillery, as wonderfully rejoyced the beholders, which by the Gunners from the Queens Forts ashore, was as worthily answered. Thus parted these Nobles, who in short time arrived in safety in Æ gypt , with their King vnto whom, having delivered the Princes presents with their letters, they omitted no reports of their honourable entertainment of the Queen and her Nobles, in such a manner, that where they or any of their traine long time after became, their table talke, was onely of their honourable welcomes in Trebisond , ever applauding the Magnificent Grace, wisdome and bounty of the Queen, whom they gave the Prize vnto, of all that lived in her time, leaving nothing vnremembred, which might any way impaire the honourable reputation of her Nobles, which vsed them with all the curtesie and bounty becomming their estates: but especially Loves Heroick Champion , the discourse of whose valour and manner of behaviour, bred more delight then the rest, for that the Nobles and commons had knowledge of his valour and worthinesse. These honourable commendations of the Nobles, joyed the King, who in his secret thoughts applauded her highnesse favour and curtesie, that for his sake and honour, had vsed those his Subjects in all Princely manner. But amongst those which tooke pleasure in hearing those discourses of the Nobles, the Queen inflamed with their reports, burned with desire to see this Peerlesse Princesse, as the Second part of this History shall shew you. Till when, leaving the King with his Peeres to their solace, returne we to Trebisond . Where the Knight imboldned by the favour of his gracious Lady, was not so great a stranger with her highnesse, but that he might at pleasure repaire to her presence, with whom by his earnest sure, and desire to be possessed of her whom he so much loved and honoured, he egged her on still to marry, which for she would not doe, without a generall consent of her Nobles and states of the Realme, she caused a Parliament to be summoned, at which time, finding her fit opportunity she imparted her determinations in this manner. Honourable Lords, and you our loving Commons here assembled, let not those few words J have to say unto you, breed any discontent, that will deliver nothing dishonourable to my state, and your disparagement, to with hold you from the same long, were more nicenesse then wisdome, wherefore briefly thus. Sithence I was by permission of him that exalteth and pulleth downe Princes at his will, I am by your honourable and generall consents, Crowned Queene of this Realme, to whose government you have as lawfully descended from him whom you all loved and feared, committed your selves, sithence which, you have all with shewes of honourable love, and care of our state and Realmes by sundry examples perswaded me to marriage, which you say, may breed your happinesse, whose good he that searcheth my hearts secrets, knoweth that I more preferre then my life on whose sutes so often made, I have advisedly considered, and noting the many perils incident to our Sexe, which rather require to be governed, then to governe, the name of King being feared, honored and loved, through feare, when they hold our Sexe in contempt. All which considered, with your former sutes, if I grant to your request, J doubt not, but I shall find that favour which the poorest of my Subjects haue freely to choose, where their loves and likings leadeth them, which if you grant, I shall hold my love well bestowed on you, and shall have cause to thinke your request in times past hath been honourable, and not to tye me to any inconvenience, assuring you, that what ever he be that I shall bend my liking unto shall not disparage my estate, nor dishonour you, but be worthy for Wisedome, valour, and what else is required in honorable persons, to mate the Princesse of most renowne on the earth. You have heard what I have to say, and wherefore chiefly this Parliament was summoned, of which I crave your answers. The Nobles and Lords both spirituall and temporall, with the Commons of both houses, hearing the Queenes motion, were all mute, not knowing suddenly in a matter of such weight what to answer. But removed from their dumps, the Speaker being both wise and well demeaned, as befitted his place humbly prostrating himselfe, thus said; Most gracious Princesse, albeit your Majesties request to this honourable house is no more then we have earnestly sought, yet pardon our sodaine answer and give us respite of time untill tomorrow, the remaine of this day, so it stand with your Princely favour, shall be spent to heare the censure of all Estates in these presence, whose love and duty is such, as they will deny nothing wherein your royall and honourable estate is not disparaged, but in all things will with all humblenesse subject themselves to your Highnesse pleasure. The Queene loath to require such haste in answering her question, graciously commanded him to rise, granting most willingly to his demands, for which the whole assembly with a uniall voyce, gave her Grace most humble thankes. The Queene having delivered the summe of her desire, graciously commending them to his will that frameth all things, accompanied with a many of her Peeres, departeth. The Queene departed, all matters in question laid apart, the Peeres and most chiefest of both houses assembled themselves in Councell, where you must suppose, no matter for the benefit of the State was omitted. The request made by their Queene, with great advice considered, which amongst them was admired, where many imaginations assailed them, devising of each side, what he should be that is in so high esteem and favour with her Grace, and of such worthy reputation as she hath reported him, eftsoones naming one, then some other, yet the principall object of her love never remembred, which drave them all to an non plus . But what ever he were, time of their own desire to answer, craved some dispatch of what they had in question. Wherfore leaving frivolous questions, they proceed to their begun action, gladly would they have beene certified of their elected King, but in vain it was for them to require it. Wherfore considering their own desires, they thought it would be taken in evill part of her Highnesse, to gain say, what with such humble and earnest sutes they had required, assuring themselves of her Wisdome, government and care of their goods, which was so wise, and every way so honourably demeaned, which considered, thereupon relying it was generally determined, to referre all to her own will, pleasure, and good liking. On which resolved, the chiefest of the Nobility, accompanied with divers oft he Clergy, in hope of the Queens good acceptance, speedeth them to the Court, who suddainly was advertised of their being, with their request, which was, to have accesse to her Highnesse No sooner was her highnesse thereof certified, but leaving her Chamber where she was busily imployed about those businesses which she had in hand, devising of the answer of the Commons, leaving all, she speedeth her vnto them, where taking her place, their duties in all humblenesse done, and she with all honourable curtesie requited it, the Speaker in presence of the whole assembly, thus said; Dread Soveraigne, the Lords both spirituall and temporall, with commons in this honourable Parliament assembled, weying with care and wisdome the honour of your highnesse, and carefully tendering the weale publike, have with great care of both (the premises) considered, with your Majesties request, albeit, they have no knowledge of his honourable person, unto whom your royall liking is united, yet relying on your Princely wisedome, and care of your Subjects, by whose welfare their happinesse is to be maintained, with one uniall consent they willingly subject themselves unto your Highnesse will and pleasure, assuring your Grace, that whom you shall vouchsafe to endue with title of Lord and husband, they will accept for their Soveraigne, and will in all humblenesse acknowledge with loving hearts their duties unto him as to their lawful King by your Majesties election. Thus my gracious Lady, have they willed me to say, in behalfe of them all, and most humbly beseech your highnesse, to make knowne vnto them the name so honoured, which you have vouchsafed to like, to the end they neglect not that duty which is due vnto him by your good Grace. The Queen hearing this answer of her Commons, was more joyed and in heart contented, then ever she was since the death of her Father, her loving Countenance shewing the content of her heart, so long discontent, which made her with most lovely grace and curtesie, to say; My Lords all, and you of the Commonaltie, you have in yeelding to these honourable motions by me made highly contented her, whose desire in Love made me not so head strong to consent without your generall liking, my choise being such, as may be mated with the oneliest Lady of highest esteeme, in the world, as I doubt not your selves will confesse, when hee shall be knowne unto you, my high esteeme of him layd apart, for that you may say, Affection is blind. And as the Proverbe saith. The Negro by nature, black and loath some in our eyes, esteemes her Infant faire ; so Love, which commandeth all creatures, caused many Princes and Ladies of worth, to submit themselves to base estates, Imperious love so overmastering their hearts, to assure you that my liking is not such, and to satisfie you, which with your curteous consent hath contented me, know your so elected Soveraigne, and he that I have subjected my love unto, is of no lesse worth then a Prince, royally borne, and descended from the loynes of a King famous, and a Queene endowed with much honour, himselfe shewing his royall discent by his demeanour, which is valiant, wise and curteous, such a one I know your desires is to chuse for your Soveraigne: All affection set apart such a one have I chosen, which shall cause all your joyes, if you joy in my good. Where breaking off their speech with other words of curtesie, yeelding them great thankes, she called Syritha whom she commanded to send some trusty Messenger for the Prince, willing him, all businesse set apart, to repaire unto her, which done, framing pleasant discourses which delighted the Nobles, she sought to their contents to beguilt the time untill the messenger returned, which made such hast, that hee found the Knight, unto whom hee imparted the Queenes pleasure, which albeit, the suddennesse thereof was troublesome unto him, cloying his head, devising of sundry matters, which her hasty sending for him should import, yet neglecting no time, hee speedeth him to the Presence, where to the Queene hee was the welcommest man living as her countenance declared; who calling him unto her, commanded a Chayre to be brought, and seated him on her left hand to the admiration of all the beholders, which done, she said; My Lords, and you our loving Subjects, muse not at this unwonted favour used to this Gentleman, nor repine not; for that it is your owne sute and my choyse, and hee that J have sworne my Love and loyall affection unto; who albeit hath thus long subjected himselfe to our service, doing us many high favours, as your owne eyes can witnesse, induced unto it by that high Commander of men, who hath procured many Princes to the like; for our Love, as I am assured, hee abandoned his Kingly Seat, disguised in the base attire of a Merchant, came to our Court, where what honours he hath gained by his valour and curtesie, not one of you but know Carmenia , being his native Soyle, and the Kingdome his by lawfull decent from the King his Father. Let it not dismay you my friends, nor judge my words spoken of him for his honour, to be more then truth, so shall you wrong him, whose worth you may be by my reports assured of, and injury her which had never intent, but to deserve well of you all. Therfore as you have your desire knowing him, in token of your love and generall consents, by whom he is your adopted King, shew by your signes of content, how pleasing my choyce and liking is vnto you, The Nobles amazed at the Queenes speech, although they could hardly be induced to beleeve what she had said, yet such was the love they honoured her, with, that giving credit vnto her words, without longer pause of the matter, that the Queen might the rather be won to credit their former speech, with a vniversall voyce, prostrating themselves before him, they cryed, God save the King and Queen, vowing vnto him loyalty and feilty, as vnto their King and Soveraigne. Thanks good my Lords, quoth the Prince, for your good consents, and doubt not of my love to you, which with such hearty affection shal be shewed, that my dearest blood shall be shed, ere the least haire of the basest of your head shall perish. Which said, the Queen standing vp, requested the Nobles, that as they had with consent elected him their King, so they would appoynt the time for solemnizing the marriage with the Coronation, changing his name from of the Carmanian Crowne, for that was his right, and the name of Marinus but vsurped. Which request of her Majesty, they easily granted, appoynting the marriage three dayes following, and the Coronation presently to follow, which to their great joyes was accomplished, with all the honour might be done by their Subjects, the costly shows, and all manner of delightfull pastimes there vsed, I omit, albeit it was pleasing both to their King and Queen, and brought great joy and comfort to all beholders. The marriage with the Coronation past the Commons delighted with their King, assured his Grace, to be so honorable as the Queen had reported him, and they found, who in that Parliament to honour the Trobisonds the more, and let them know, his love was no whit inferiour to theirs, he entailed the Caowne of Carmania , to the lawfull heire of Trebisond , succeeding, assuring them, that his Nobles and Commons, should confirme and assure the same. Which curteous favour, the Peeres and Nobles so gratefully accepted, as they returned him for the same, many gracious thankes: the Parliament proroged, according to the custome of the Country, their duties in all humblenesse done, the Nobles, with the chiefest of all parts in the Land, wished the Queen and King many happy dayes, to their joy and hearts content: which they requited with such showes of love, as might delight them, and giue them cause to joy in their Princes election, of whom their comfort was great, and their assurance of Tranquillity with forraigne Princes, through his magnanimy, to be such, as all true subjects might have pleasure to recount: Their leave taken, every one departs, well content to his owne home.  How the aged Machaon , that Pilgrim like hath travailed many Countries, in search of the Prince Armatius , arrived in the Court of Trebisond whom the King questioned of his Country and travaile; And in the end is knowne to be his Tutor Machaon , who doth recount vnto him all the troubles of his Country of Carmania . His gracious welcome to the Queene, and of the dispatching Ambassadours into the Kingdome of Carmania .  and more increased, that there was no talke but onely of their most faithfull love, and hearts liking: through which, the Commons lived in peace and tranquility, praying for their long lives to be continued. To which content in Love, the Story leaveth them, recounting the arrivall of the aged Machaon in Trebisond , who with his long travell came vnto the Court, where wandring Pilgrim like, living by the devotion of bountifull people, he spent some time in contemplation, others in viewing the beauty of the Court, and manners of the people, eftsoones commending their Religion, and serving their Creator: taking much pleasure in discoursing with such Pilgrim- strangers as he met, of the divers conditions of those Nations, whose Countries he had seene, which being many, he affected no Princes Region, as this Countrey of Trebisond . This grave and ancient aged Father, overworne with griefe and tedious long travaile, was so much altered in his face, as he that (in former time) had well knowne him, might very well now have mistaken his feature: which made the King (who oftentimes had noted his comely person) his Pilgrims attire, and other Ornaments, too Religious belonging, greatly to affect him, little suspecting it was the aged Machaon . But as time revealeth greatest secrets, and bringeth friends to knowledge, so the King taking pleasure, beholding this Pilgrime, noted him so often, that his Physiognomy to his memory, presented the feature of his beloved Machaon , which imagined thought, began to take such roote in the King, as he greatly desired to have some conference with the Pilgrime, evermore perswading himselfe that it was his noble Tutor, and carefull Physitian. To assure himselfe, and the better to be resolved of that doubt, he determined to have some certain knowledge of the aged man if he might, and for that intent, caused his Pages to give diligent heed, if they saw him in the Court, to bring him tydings thereof, which they did according to his Majesties commandement, attending with such care, at that vsuall time he was accustomed to come, that he [illeg.]d not of them vnperceived, whereof they gave the King intelligence, by whose command he was summoned to his presence. The aged Pilgrime at his first summons of the messenger, was in such dread of wrong to be offered him, as he greatly feared some ill to betide him, well knowing that Princes have many eyes, and strangers are markes, how poore soever their estates are, especially frequenting the Court as he did, yet he whose conscience could not accuse him of any evill intent against the King, had this hope that God whom he served, doth protect the innocent, and would deliver him. Thus casting his care on him that commandeth Kings, not without many imaginations what should be the cause he came vnto the Kings presence, vnto whom as one that knew his good, he prostrated himselfe, praying most heartily for the Kings prosperity. The King which saw the old man bowing before him, kindly tooke him from the ground, tendering his age, which he honoured, whom the more he noted, the more, the lovely face of his beloved Machaon , presents it vnto his memory, the thought of who, caused his hart to much sorrow, yet shaking off the griefe, of Father, Kingdome,  & friend, he said; Aged Father, in whose face appeareth gravity, tell me of ye dutifull love yu owest thy most beloved friend, of what Country thou art,  & what fortunes hath brought thee to this Region; that honoring thee, whose age requireth the same, I may further thy sutes if thou have any, or wanting wealth, J may releeve thee. The wofull Pilgrime, revived by those honorable speeches of the King, said; Renowned Prince, the mirror of honour, of whose fame the world is filled, to satisfie your Excellence, know, that occasions of importance thereunto moving me, I forsooke my native Country in search of those whom my fortune was never yet to meet, yet have J travailed many Kingdomes, and in my travell, have seen many Princes Courts, and noted their severall demeanors, yet most gracious Soveraigne, never tooke J pleasure in any, as in this Country of Trebisond , the Nobles especially giving me cause to admire them, whose minds shew their true Gentility, as the fruit maketh the tree known; in which taking delight, J have though more then beseemeth a stranger, so often frequented thy Court; wherewith: if your Grace take any offence, J humbly beseech your pardon, which am now ready to depart. The King, which had heard that tongue so often reade him many Lectures, and given him instructions of honour, was not deceived in him; albeit he forbare to acknowledge him whom he desired so heartily to see, vnto whom he was more welcome then any man living, yet concealing himselfe, he said; Father, thanks for thy love, and honorable report of our Realme and people, for which J rest thy debter. But tell me aged man, of what Country art thou? and what account were those friends with thee, whom thou with such overweary travell hast sought; whether thy allies, or thy friends by adoption. At this motion of the King, the old man overcome with the thoughts of those of whom his pittifull tale was to be told could not forbeare teares, which with such abundance of bitter sobs and heavy sighs were vttered, insomuch that it moved the King to great wrath, seeing those silver haires which he honoured (bedeawed with salt drops, the outward witnesse of his inward discontent. Wherefore like the carefull Physitian, having ministred bitter Pilles to his Patient, seasoneth the same with some sweeter tast, he comforteth the aged Machaon , with words so pleasing, that it cheared the old man, yet would not pardon his report, which caused him to say; Famous King, if pitty of my old age may any way move you, vrge not my faltering tongue to vtter a tale of such ruth as it importeth: the remembrance wherof over cloyeth me with extreame sorrow, and will bring your Excellence but small delight. Therefore, Soveraigne Prince, pardon me, which cannot reveale the truth of so pittifull a tale, (as yet) without the hazard of my life, my heart so overcharged with griefe, that to thinke thereon, draweth me neare to death, then pardon me: But how loath soever, the King might not be intreated, whom with such pleasing speech he forceth on, that comforted by his Majesties kind words, whom he would not gainsay: he said; sithence nothing may perswade your Excellence to pitty me, accept in worth my rudenesse, and pardon it. Which said, humbly doing his duty, as one that could his good, he thus proceeded; Dread Lord, know Carmania is my native soyle, where through the Grace of my thrice noble Prince, J consumed my youth in all happinesse, favoured by his favour, with the best of account in that Region, and so graced by the King, that hee committed the Government of his deare Sonne, more deare to him then life, to be trained vp by mee, of whom, as duty willed me; J had that care as is required of a Subject vnto his Lord, joying in nothing the world possesseth, so much as in the towardnesse of the Prince, whose vertuous youth, might be a Load starre to all that ever I saw, for curtesie matchlesse; bountifull as Tymon , more valiant then Hector , or the best deserving that lived; cunning was he in the liberall Artes, what should I say of him whose honourable praise, no tongue can with such commendations vtter, as his honours and vertues requireth, so generally beloved of all men, that death is more sweeter to many thousands of his Subjects, then the remembrance of that Noble Prince. Here teares restrained his speech, that he could not vtter a word, standing so astonished, that he rather represented the Image of Death, then a living creature, who the King put from his heavy passion thus: Father, thou hast filled my heart with a world of wonders, at thy strange talke; which J conjure thee, of that love thou owest the Prince, whom thou sorrowest so to remember, not to leave in such abrupt manner, but proceed: dyed the King and the Prince, so of thee honoured, and thorough their deaths gan thy travell. Say sweet Father? Though the reporting of this dolefull History, more grievous vnto mee then death, should finish my dayes, yet such is the penance by your Majesties conjuring speech enjoyned me, that what griefe soever I endure. I will satisfie your Grace, The Prince, Oh my Lord, that it would please you to pardon the rest, growing to yeares of discretion, I know not through what meanes, neither could I for all the diligence J vsed, attain vnto it, but sick he was and so opprest with such a strange agony, that no Physick could minister reliefe vnto him, nor yeeld him any ease, so that there was small hope of his recovery, the strangenesse of each malady being such, as sometime faring like a man franticke no perswasions of reason might prevaile with him, who in his health was to be ruled in all things, This passion so long assailed the Prince, and so little hope of his recovery, that the extreamity thereof, gan touch the King and Queene mother, whose carefull love was such, as nature could not require more in parents whatsoever. The continuall griefe of the Prince, wrought such care in the aged King and Queen, that it was not to be found which of them was most grieved or whose lot it was to give his due to death first: yet as no care is so great but hath some comfort, so the commanmander of men, when all hope of life, was past hope of men, restored the Prince to health; and by his health recovered the King and Queen, for whose weale, the Commons more rejoyced, then of their own good, so that a generall joy was throughout the Realme, tryumphing at this happy recovery of the Prince; the King and Queene. But as the fairest day is overshadowed with clouds, so was the Sunshine of their joy eclipsed, through the great folly of the Prince, who vnknowne of all men, or acquainting any with his pretence, left his Father, Crowne, and Subjects, and liveth no man knoweth how, or where; for whom the King felt a million of woes: griefe so assailing his aged Corps, as he was like to rest with death, but reason subduing affection, he recovered his sicknesse, and leaving his Land without a Governor, likewise departed, whither no man knoweth. The mother Queen, being of nature but weake, resigned her due to death, whom as duty commands me, I entombed with such honour as beseemeth the person of a Queene, and so perswaded with the commons in a Parliament, for the same intent called, as the government of the Realme was committed to sixe of the Nobility, who are bound to resigne their authority, when the lawful successour shall require it. Which done, I forsooke all I enjoyed, and Pilgrim-like (as your Highness sees) have travelled many Countries and Kingdomes in search of my Soveraign the Prince, but for all the diligence J can vse, of them can learne no tydings. Thus with teares standing in his eyes he ended his lamentable History, which the King was assured to be true, but least was the thought of Machaon , that he delivered this dolefull tale to the Prince: which had likewise some cause of griefe, which so neare touched himselfe, as he could not for teares vtter what he would, yet putting by his passions as he could, he said: Aged Father, matter of great ruth hast thou delivered, which to heare is most lamentable, and may touch that carelesse Prince neare, by whom this chance is chanced his Parents and Subjects: But tell me Father, all griefe layd apart, in what state liveth the Subjects of thy King, vnder their government with the charge. Yet is not your Grace satisfied (quoth the Pilgrime) but will exact on me more to encrease my griefe; which seeing you delight in. J shall vnfold that which in recounting, will finish all; yeelding my breath to him that gave it me, therefore attend. Not long sithence, vnknown I chanced to accompany in my travell, a Gentleman of Carmania , to me well known, which for I saw I was out of knowledge with him, I questioned him of many matters, as your Grace hath done me, which amongst other his newes of discontent, reported that those elected governours, whose hearts broyling with ambition and desire of the whole authority, as the title of King, to the ambitious is sweet, so these covetous wretches, taking part one with the other, some enclining one way, some to the other part, that civill discention was raised, where the Father bare Armes against the Son, the Son against the Father, and kinsman against kinsman, one imbruing their hands in others blood, through which, many a woman is left a Widdow, and many a sweet infant fatherlesse, which makes me greatly feare, without his helpe that sendeth all helpe, to the helplesse, the land will be impoverished, and our King and Prince returning, shall from their propper right be debarred, by these vsurping villaines, whose hearts my aged teeth in revenge of their treachery and wrong done the Commons, J could teare. The Prince hearing this tale of discontent, was moved more at the wrong offered the Commons, then all the former History, which made him say; Father, I have noted thy long tale, which hath moved me both to sorrow and delight, grieving for the commons opprest, yet joying that any Prince should have a subject of such worth as is rare in these times to be found; wherfore Father, that thou maist live in my Court to draw others to their fidelity to their Prince, J will here detaine thee, and for thou lovest that carelesse Prince Armation , will honour thee during my life, enduing thee with Treasure, and what else thou shalt st any time command, for all I enjoy is thine, and if hereafter thou shalt thinke it convenient, I will with a strong power, enter their distressed confines, and chastening those Rebels, leave thee Regent in their place, vntill further tydings shall be of thy King or his Sonne, whom I am sure will not abuse them. The aged Father, hearing those honourable speeches from the mouth of the King, was astonied, knowing well that Princes of esteem honor themselves, holding their words, yet not minded to give over search for his Soveraigne, he returned the King humble thanks, beseeching his Highnesse to pardon him, which hath vowed to end his life in performing his vow to the Prince, and either heare tydings of him, or never see his Countrey, the place of the world most pleasing vnto him. The King hearing his words, having great experience of his fidelity, could conceale himselfe no longer; but imbracing him in his armes, bedeawing his aged haires with drops like raine, he said; Faithfull Machaon , the mirror of true friendship, whose equall in love is not to be found, what cause have I to honor thee, whose care is such of me, that have so ill deserved, but forgive me Machaon , my misse against thee committed, forgive mee Noble Father, and you Subjects of Carmania , who by mee vnhappy creature, have been so much wronged, and thou Machaon , my carefull Tutor, forgive me I entreat, and continue thy love vnto me vnhappy Prince, whom thou hast now found, which for thy fidelity hath vowed to honour thee, as hereafter my deeds shall manifest. Wherefore after thy weary travaile, rest thee with me in Trebisond . where thou shalt be a Second Armatius , for never will J live longer, then to be held a friend and perfect lover of thee, which with such carefull travaile, truth and loyalty hath shewed thy selfe so firme a friend. Machaon , as a man whose sences was beraved, standing long time staring in the face of the King, as a man ravished, beholding with good advise, his Physiognomy, when through his long view, by a secret signe he had knowledge of his Soveraigne, such sudden joy assailed him, that overcome with the same hee fell in a trance; to the great discomfort of the King, who shewed his skill to revive him, with shaking and rubbing his pulses, sparing no paines untill he had brought him to breath, who being recovered, turning his eyes as a man distracted, after he had paused a while, said; Worthy Prince, how blessed am I of the Gods, that have granted me such grace to behold my Soveraigne, the chiefe joy of my worldly joyes, which having seene, I care not how soone the summons of Death attach me, my request being obtained, which have long time cloyed their Deities with my tedious Orisons for thy welfare, which seeing, by their permission I have obtained. Let it not be offensive unto your Majestie to resolve me, what moved you to leave your noble Father, and those your Subjects that honored you, unto whom your Excellence was more deare then life. Uncurteous, my loving Machaon , might I he held and accounted amongst men most ungratefull, if J should deny thy request who hath shewed thy selfe so firme a Friend unto me, therefore attend what grievous maladies opprest me. My good friend, quoth the King, is knowne to none so well as your selfe, whose paines for my recovery was such as I shall never requite, the cause I have heard thee and many learned of our Countrey affirme, they could never attaine to know, though for my recovery all meanes was by them and you sought, which made my griefe the more to increase. The originall proceeding from a conceited fancy, Love mastering my heart, which with such power commanded all my inferiour parts, as J expected no other but Death, which I rather would have subjected my selfe unto, then have revealed the same. But he that governeth mens thoughts, on the sodaine as you can witnesse, when all hope was past, armed mee with courage, whereon I tooke such hold, resolving to follow my determinations, that with thought therof, I recovered in short time my health, which obtained, disguised in the attire of a Marchant, having provided me sufficient store of Coyne and jewels, J imbarqued my selfe for this Port, where without carrying any other shew, J imployed by Brokers my stocke to maintain my charge, till opportunity was offered me in defence of the King heere, and his daughter my Queene, to shew my force against the Turke his invading foe, wherein J obtained a happy victory, and by that victory obtaining some better reputation, the King holding me right deare, where by the hand of the Princesse J received my Knighthood, a gift so pleasing to me as in the worlds regiment was not to be found, esteeming more the honour done me by my sweet Mistresse, the commander of my heart, then all the Kingdomes of the earth, for by her Love J lived, without whose favour, I had long sithence rested with the dead, she my Machaon , which untill my comming into her Countrey J never saw, but onely by report of her vertuous and honourable demeanours, whereof no man could say sufficient, so enthralled my heart, that nothing but her Love might preserve my life, so had her vertues intangled me in love unto her, whose Love it hath pleased the heavenly powers to bestow upon me, whereof being possest, no man hath more cause to glorifie their Deities. Thus my Machaon , have I acquainted thee with my cares, never before to any knowne: Love of this Lady, was the Load-starre brought me hither, through whose love I possest the crowne of Trebisond and Kingdome, whether no man so welcome as my Machaon , and so use me sweet Friend, quoth the King, as if I were Machaon , for next my Lady and Queene, thou possessest the entire affection of my heart. The Queene which expected her Lords company for dinner, musing at his long stay, having no more company in his study but the Pilgrime, went her selfe to call him, and to breake their parley, thus pleasantly she said; My Lord, quoth the Queene, are your offences so great and your sins so many, that they require such long time for absolution, in my opinion, your Highnesse were good, if you have not finished to take some vyands, and then begin againe; for J assure you, it is dinner time long since. Your Grace, quoth the King, is pleasantly disposed, I am glad to see you in so good a humour, especially my friend being in place, which of the love you beare me, J intreat to bid welcome, for he is neare and deare unto me. The Queene hearing the King, well noting his words, imagined that shee was deluded, and that his reputation was not such as he had reported himselfe to be, yet that her thoughts might breed no dislike through her silence, she curteously raised the Pilgrime from the ground, giving her hand to kisse, and with shew of the best content she could, bade him heartily welcome, beseeching the King to let her know what he was, that she might doe him that honour as his estate required. Thankes Madame, quoth the King, for in honouring him, you shall shew your love to mee, which have great cause to requite him; to satisfie your Grace what hee is being so poore in attire, and so high in esteeme with me: Know Madame, he was sometime of Councell to my Father the King, and my faithfull Physitian and Tutor in my minority, whose loyalty and love hath been such to me in times past, as since I abandoned my Country, he forsooke not onely his possessions, but his place of honour, and what else he joyed most in, committing his aged corps to travell, and many Princes Countries hath travelled in search for me, of whom he never had hope ever to behold again: leaving my Realme in such wise as I did them, whereof your Ladiships love was the cause, though all the Physitians of the country could not by their skill find it; Therefore Madame, for my sake love him, and give him your favourable countenance, which he will endeavour to deserve. The Queen put by her imaginations, assured what the King said was truth, (whom to please) she entertained so graciously, as if he had been a Prince of great worth, which joyed the aged man and highly contented the King, who not willing to detaine their stomackes, which long before was ready for dinner: taking Machaon by the hand, ledde him to the presence, where sitting down to dinner, he placed him opposite against him, gracing him with what countenance he could best frame to content him, wherein the Queene for her part was not behind.
