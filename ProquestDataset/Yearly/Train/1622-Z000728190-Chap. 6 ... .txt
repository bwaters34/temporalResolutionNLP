 Lord of S. Albanes , a most eloquent man, and of as found learning and wisedome, as England bred in many Ages: with the old Lord William Burghley , Lord Treasurer of England, haue aboue others herein beene admired, and commended in their publique speeches in the Parliament house and Starre- Chamber: for nothing drawes our attention more then good matter, eloquently digested, and vttered with a gracefull, cleere, and distinct pronuntiation. But to be sure your stile may passe for currant, as of the richest alloy, imitate the best Authors as well in Oratorie as Historie; beside the exercise of your owne Inuention, with much conference with those who can speak well: nor bee so foolish precise as a number are, who make it Religion to speake otherwise then this or that Author. As Longolius was laughed at by the learned, for his so apish and superstitious imitation of Tully , in so much as hee would haue thought a whole Volume quite marred, if the word Possibile had passed his pen; because it is not to be found in all Tullie: or euery Sentence had not sunke with, esse posse videatur , like a peale ending with a chime, or an Amen vpon the Organes in Paules . For as the young Virgin to make her fairest Garlands, gathereth not altogether one kind of Flower; and the cunning Painter, to make a delicate beautie, is forced to mixe his Complexion, and compound it of many Colours; the Arras-worker, to please the eyes of Princes, to be acquainted with many Histories: so are you to gather  5 this Hony of Eloquence  a , A gift of heauen , out of many fields; making it your owne by diligence in collection, care in expression, and skill in digestion. But let me leade you forth into these all-flowrie and verdant fields, where so much sweete varietie will amaze, and make you doubtfull where to gather first. 6 First, Tullie (in whose bosome the Treasure of Eloquence seemeth to haue beene locked vp, and with him to haue perished) offereth himselfe as Pater Romani eloquij : whose words and stile (that you may not bee held an Heretique of all the world) you must preferre aboue all other, as well for the sweetnesse, grauitie, richnesse, and vnimitable texture thereof; as that his workes are throughout seasoned with all kind of Learning, and relish of a singular and Christianlike honesty. There wanted not in him (saith Tacitus ) knowledge of Geometry, of 7 Musicke, of no manner of Art that was commendable and honest; he knew the subtiltie of Logicke, each part of Morall Philosophy , and so forth. How well he was seene in the Ciuill Lawes, his Bookes De logibus , and his Actions in Verrem , will shew you: which are the rather worthy your reading, because you shall there see the grounds of many of our Lawes heere in England. For the integrity of his mind, though his Offices had lien suppressed, let this one saying (among many thousands) perswade you to a charitable opinion of the same: Arecta conscientia transuersum 8 vnguem, non oportet. quenquam in omni sua vita discedere . Whereto I might adde that tale of Gyges ring in his Offices, which booke let it not seeme contemptible vnto you, because it lyeth tossed and torne in euery Schoole; but be precious, as it was sometime vnto the old Lord Burghley , Lord high Treasurer of England, before named; who, to his dying day, would alwaies carry it about him, either in his bosome or pocket, being sufficient (as one said of Aristotles Rhetoriques) to make both a Scholler and an honest man. Imitate Tullie for his phrase and stile, especially in his Epistles Ad Atticum ; his Bookes De Oratore : among his Orations, those Pro M. Marcello, Pro Archia Poeta, T. Annio Milone, Sext. Rose. Amerino, Pub. Quinctio : the first two against Catiline ; and the third Action against Verres . These in my opinion are fullest of life, but you may vse your discretion, you cannot make your choice amisse. After Cicero , I must needs bring you C aesar , whom  9 Tullie himselfe confesseth of all Orators, to haue spoken  10 the most eloquent and purest Latine; Et hanc bene loquendi laudem (saith he) multis literis, & ijs quidem reconditis & exquisitis, summoque studio & diligentia est consequutus .  11 And, In quo (saith Quintilian) tanta vis, id acumen, ea concitatio , vt illum eodem animo dixisse appareat quo bellauit. In whom, there was so great vehemency, that fine iudement, that courage and motion, that it seemes hee wrote with the same Spirit hee fought . To reade him as you ought, you must bring with you an able iudgement, beside your Dictionarie; by reason of the diuersitie of Countries, Tracts, Places, Riuers, People, names of ancient Cities and Townes, to be sought out, in moderne, strange, and vnknowne names: of materials in buildings (as in his bridge ouer the Rhine framed, Ex tignis, trabibus, fibulis, sublicis, longurijs, &c .) which, except you were seene in Architecture, you would hardly vnderstand: then strange names and formes of warlike Engines and weapons then in vse: sundry formes of fortification, water-workes, and the like; which notwithstanding, since haue beene made knowne and familiar vnto vs, by the painefull labours of those all- searching wits, Lipsius, Ramus, Giouanni de Ramellis , and others: and may be read in English excellently translated and illustrated, by that learned and truly honourable Gentleman, S  r Clement Edmondes Knight, Clearke of his Maiesties most honorable Priuie Counsell, my worthy friend: though many excellent workes of C aesars , as his Epistles, his Astronomy, &c. through the iniquitie of enuious Time, are vtterly lost and perished. 12 Now offereth himselfe Cornelius Tacitus , the Prince of Historians; of who I may not vntruly say (as Scaliger of Virgil) E cuius ore nil temere excidit , as well for his diligence as grauitie; so copious in pleasing breuitie, each Sentence carrying with it a kind of loftie State and Maiestie, such as should (me think) proceed from the mouth of Greatnesse and Command; in sense retired, deepe, and not fordable to the ordinarie Reader. Hee doth in part speake most pure and excellent English, by the industry of that most learned and iudicious Gentleman; whose long labour and infinite charge in a farre greater worke, haue wonne him the loue of the most learned, and drawn not onely the eye of Greece , but all Europe to his admiration. But there being, as Lipsius saith, Suus cuiq lingu ae genius: Let me aduise you of this by the way, that no Translation whatsoeuer will affect you, like the Authors owne and proper language: for to reade him as hee spake, it confirmeth our iudgments with an assured boldnesse and confidence of his intent and meaning; remouing that scruple of Iealousie we haue commonly of ignorant and vnfaithfull pens, which deale many times herein, sublesta fide . Besides, it is an iniurie to the Author, who heereby loseth somewhat of his value: like a peece of rich stuffe in a Brokers shop, onely for that it is there at a second hand, though neuer worne, or newly translated but yesterday. The next Titus Liuius , whom like a milky Fountaine,  13 you shall euery where finde flowing, with such an elegant sweetnesse, such banquetlike varietie, that you would imagine other Authors did but bring your mouth out of taste. In his first Decade, you haue the comming of Æ neas into Italy , the building of Rome , the first choise of the Senate, the religious rites of Numa , the braue combate of the Horatij and Curiatij , the tyranny of Tarquine , the rape of Lucrece by Sextus his sonne, and first Consuls created. In the third, the Historie of the second Punicke warre, Hannibals passage against the league ouer the Riuer Iberus , who after eight moneths siedge, tooke Saguntum ; his passage ouer the Pyr aenean hills, his forraging of France : after ascending the Alpes , with his ouerthrow of the Romanes , with his Horse troopes at the Riuer Ticine , where Scipio (after Africanus ) rescued his father, beeing verie grieuously wounded. His second ouerthrow of the Romanes , at the Riuer Trebia , his hard passage in cruell weather and tempests, ouer the Appenine ,  &c. In the fourth, is recorded the occasion of the warre, against Philip king of Macedonia (concerning the comming in of two young men of Acarnania , into the Temple of Ceres at At hens :) Against whom Sulpitius was sent, by whom the Macedonians were ouerthrowne in an horse battaile: how L. Furius subdued the rebellious Gaules , ouerthrew Hamilcar with thirtie fiue thousand Carthaginians ; with many other expeditions of Philip of Macedon , and Sulpitius. In the fist, the going out of the fire in the Temple of Uesta ; how Titus Sempronius Gracchus , subdued the Celtiberian Spaniards , and built a Towne in Spaine called Gracchuris , after his name; Post humius Albinius triumphed ouer the Portugals : the number of the Citizens of Rome reckoned by the poll, with the Law of Volumnius Saxa , by which no woman was to inherit,  &c. Be then acquainted with Quintus Curtius , who passing  14 eloquently with a faithfull penne and sound iudgement, writeth the Life and Acts of Alexander ; in whom you shall see the patterne of a braue Prince, for Wisedome, Courage, Magnanimitie, Bountie, Courtesie, Agilitie of body, and whatsoeuer else were to be wished in Maiestie; till surfeiting (in the best of his age) on his excessiue Fortunes, and euen burthensome to himselfe:  15 by his ouer-greatnesse, he became ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , an vnprofitable burthen of the earth, and from the darling of heauen, to be the disdaine of all the world. 16 After him (whom indeed I should haue preferred before, as being honoured with the Title of Histori ae pater ) followeth Salust , commended most for breuitie; as also for the richnesse of his speech and phrase; but wherein his breuitie consisteth, the most are ignorant. Our Grammarians imagine, because his Discourses (as they say) are only of the matter and persons barely and nakedly described, without circumstance and preparation, counsels and deliberations had before, effects and euents after: which is quite contrarie; as may be seene by the Conspiracie of Catiline , which hee might in a manner haue set downe in three words. But how amply, and with what adoe doth he describe it? what circumstances more open, more abundant, then where he saith; The Romane Souldiers being amazed with an vnwonted vprore, betooke them to their Weapons: some hid themselues, others aduised their Companions to stand steutly to it: they were afraid in euery place, the multitude of Enemies was so great. The heauen was obscured with night, and thicke Cloudes, the perill wis doubtfull: and lastly, no man knew whether it were safest for him to flye, or to stay by it ? And let them now see their error, who affirme his Discourse to be vnfurnished of Counsels, Deliberations, Consultations,  &c. Is not the reason set downe, why Iugurth assaulted Cirtha at the arriuall of the Embassadours? the intent and preparation of the warre by Metellus the Consull, laid open in an ample manner, wherein consisteth the richnesse of his Discourse? His breuitie indeed, worthy your obseruation and imitation, consisteth in shutting vp whole and weightie Sentences in three words, fetching nothing afarre, or putting in more then needs; but in quicke and stirring Asyndeta's after his manner: as the most learned haue  17 out of him obserued. And since it is Tullies aduice, as was his owne vse (as himselfe testifieth) Non in Philosophia solum, sed etiam in dicendi exercitatione, cum Gr aecis Latina coniungere: By this time acquaint your selfe with that golden Cyri p aedia 18 of Xenophon , whom heere you shall see a couragious and braue Commander, marshalling an Army: there a most graue and eloquent Philosopher, in the person of Cyrus , shaping out vnto vs with Inke of Nectar , a perfect and absolute Prince, (to the example of all Princes and Nobilitie) for his studies, his dyet, his exercise, his carriage, and euery way manner of liuing: insomuch, as the Noble Scipio Africanus , as well in his warres abroad, as in peace at home, aboue all other held Xenophon in highest regard, euer saying, he could neuer commend him sufficiently, or reade him ouer often enough. Hitherto haue I giuen you a taste (at your own choice) as well for vniuersall Historie, as your imitation in writing and speaking. That I account vniuersall, which entreateth of the beginning, increase, gouernment, and alterations of Monarchies, Kingdomes, and Commonwealths: and to further you herein, you may reade Iustine, Diodorus Siculus, Zonaras, Orosius ; of more later times, Sabellicus, Carion , with some others. 19 For speciall Historie, that reporteth the affaires and gouernment of particular Estates; you haue the most ancient Herodotus , the Noble and eloquent Thucydides, Arrianus, Halicarnass aeus, Polybius, Suetonius , and others. 20 All Historie diuideth it selfe into foure branches: the first spreadeth it selfe into, and ouer all place, as Geographie : the second, groweth and gathereth strength with tract of time, as Chronologie : the third, is laden with descents, as Genealogie : the fourth and last (like the golden  21 Bow Proserpina gaue Æ neas ) is that, truly called by Cicero, Lux veritatis , which telleth vs of things as they were done, and of all other most properly is called Historie . For all Historie in times past, saith Tullie , was none other  22 then Annalium Consectio , the making of Annales , that is, recording of what was done from yeere to yeere. But while I wander in forraigne Historie, let me warne you, ne sis peregrinus domi : that you be not a stranger in the Historie of your owne Countrey, which is a common  23 fault imputed to our English Trauellers in forreine Countries; who curious in the obseruation and search of the most memorable things and monuments of other places, can say (as a great Peere of France told me) nothing of their owne our Countrey of England , being no whit inferior to any other in the world, for matter of Antiquitie, and rarities of euery kinde worthy remarke and admiration. Herein I must worthily and onely preferre vnto you the glorie of our Nation, M. Camden , aswell for his iudgement and diligence, as the puritie and sweet fluence of his Latine style; and with him the rising Starre of good letters and Antiquitie, M. Iohn Selden of the Inner Temple. As for Giraldus, Geoffrey, Higden, Ranulph of Chester, Walsingham a Monke of S. Albanes with the rest, they did cum s aeculo caecutire , and tooke vpon credite many a time more then they could well answer; that I may omit Polydore Virgil an Italian, who did our Nation that deplorable iniurie, in the time of K. Henrie the eight, for that his owne Historie might passe for currant, he burned and embezeled the best and most ancient Records and Monuments of our Abbeies, Priories, and Cathedrall Churches, vnder colour (hauing a large Commission vnder the Great Seale) of making search for all such monuments, manusc . records, Legier bookes ,  &c. as might make for his purpose; yet for all this he hath the ill lucke to write nothing wel, saue the life of Henrie the seuenth, wherein he had reason to take a little more paines then ordinarie, the booke being dedicated to Henrie the eight his sonne. No subiect affecteth vs with more delight then Historie , imprinting a thousand formes vpon our imaginations, from the circumstances of Place, Person, Time, Matter, manner, and the like. And, what can be more profitable 24 (saith an ancient Historian) then sitting on the Stage of humane life, to be made wise by their example, who haue tred the path of error and danger before vs? Bodin tels vs of some, who haue recouered their healthes by reading of Historie; and it is credibly affirmed of King Alphonsus , that the onely reading of Quint. Curtius , cured him of a very dangerous feuer. If I could haue beene so rid of my late quartane ague, I would haue said with the same good King: Valeat Avicenna, viuat Curtius ; and haue done him as much honour, as euer the Chians their Hippocrates , or the Sun-burnd Ægyptians their Æ sculapius. For Moralitie and rules of well liuing, deliuered with such sententious grauitie, weight of reason, so sweetened  25 with liuely & apt similitudes, entertaine Plutarch ; whom according to the opinion of Gaza the world would preserue (should it be put to the choice to receiue one onely Authour (the Sacred Scriptures excepted) and to burne all the rest) especially his Liues and Morals . After him, the vertuous and diuine Seneca , who for that he liued so neere the times of the Apostles, and had familiar acquaintance with S. Paul (as it is supposed by those Epistles that passe vnder either their names) is thought in  26 heart to haue beene a Christian; and certes so it seemeth to me, by that Spirit, wherewith so many rules of Patience, Humilitie, Contempt of the world, are refined and exempt from the dregges of Paganisme. Some say that about the beginning of Neroes raigne, he came ouer hither into Brittaine ; but most certaine it is, he had diuers  27 lands bestowed on him here in England , and those supposed to haue laine in Essex neere to Camalodunum , now Maldon. Againe, while you are intent to forreine Authors and Languages, forget not to speake and write your owne properly and eloquently: whereof (to say truth) you shall haue the greatest vse, (since you are like to liue an eminent person in your Countrey, and meane to make no profession of Schollership.) I haue knowne euen excellent Schollers so defectiue this way, that when they had beene beating their braines twentie, or foure and twentie yeeres about Greeke Etymologies, or the Hebrew roots and Rabbines, could neither write true English, nor true Orthographie: and to haue heard them discourse in publike, or priuately at a table, you would haue thought you had heard Loy talking to his pigges, or Iohn de Indagine , declaiming in the praise of wild geese; otherwise for their iudgement in the Arts and other tongues very sufficient. To helpe your selfe herein, make choice of those Authors in prose, who speake the best and purest English. I would commend vnto you (though from more Antiquitie) the life of Richard the third written by Sir Thomas Moore , the Arcadia of the noble Sir Philip Sidney , whome Du Bartas makes one of the foure columnes of our language; the Essayes and other peeces  28 of the excellent Master of Eloquence, my Lord of S. Albanes , who possesseth not onely Eloquence, but all good learning, as hereditarie both by Father and Mother. You haue then M. Hooker his Politie; Henrie the fourth well written by Sir John Hayward ; that first part of our English Kings by M. Samuel Daniel . There are many others I know, but these will tast you best, as proceeding from no vulgar iudgments: the last Earle of Northampton in his ordinary stile of writing was not to be mended. Procure then, if you may, the Speeches made in Parliament: frequent learned Sermons, in Terme time resort to the Starre-Chamber, and be present at the pleadings in other publique Courts, whereby you shall better your speech, enrich your vnderstanding, and get more experience in one moneth, then in other foure by keeping your Melancholy studie, and by solitarie meditation. Imagine not that hereby I would binde you from reading all other bookes, since there is no booke so bad, euen Sir Beuis himselfe, Owleglasse , or Nashes herring, but some commoditie may be gotten by it. For as in the same pasture, the Oxe findeth fodder, the Hound a hare, the Stork alizard, the faire maide flowers; so we cannot, except we list  29 our selues (saith Seneca ) but depart the better from any booke whatsoeuer. 30 And ere you begin a booke, forget not to reade the Epistle; for commonly they are best laboured and penned. For as in a garment, whatsoeuer the stuffe be, the owner (for the most part) affecteth a costly and extraordinarie facing; and in the house of a countrey Gentleman, the porch of a Citizen, the carued gate and painted postes carrie away the Glorie from the rest: So is it with our common Authors, if they haue any wit at all, they set it like veluer before, though the backe, like (a bankerupts doublet) be but of poldauie or buckram. Affect not as some doe, that bookish Ambition, to be stored with bookes and haue well furnished Libraries, yet keepe their heads emptie of knowledge: to desire to haue many bookes, and neuer to vse them, is like a childe that will haue a candle burning by him, all the while he is sleeping .  31 Lastly, haue a care of keeping your bookes handsome, and well bound, not casting away ouermuch in their gilding or stringing for ostentation sake, like the prayer bookes of girles and gallants, which are carried to Church but for their outsides. Yet for your owne vse spare them not for nothing or interlining (if they be printed) for it is not likely you meane to be a gainer by them, when you haue done with them; neither suffer them through negligence to mold  & be moath-eaten, or want their strings and couers. 32 King Alphonsus about to lay the foundation of a Castle at Naples , called for Uitruvius his book of Architecture; the booke was brought in very bad case, all dustie and without couers: which the King obseruing said, He that must couer vs all, must not goe vncouered himselfe : Then commanded the booke to be fairely bound and brought vnto him. So say I, suffer them not to lie neglected, who must make you regarded; and goe in torne coates, who must apparell your minde with the ornaments of knowledge, aboue the roabes and riches of the most magnificent Princes. To auoide the inconuenience of moathes and moldinesse, let your studie be placed, and your windowes open  33 if it may be, towards the East, for where it looketh South or West, the aire being euer Subiect to moisture, moathes are bred and darkishnesse encreased, whereby your mappes and pictures will quickly become pale, loosing their life and colours, or rotting vpon their cloath, or paper, decay past all helpe and recouerie. Of Poetrie. To sweeten your seuerer studies, by this time vouchsafe Poetry your respect: which howsoeuer censured and seemeth fallen from the higest Stage of Honour, to the lowest staire of disgrace, let not your iudgement be infected with that pestilent ayre of the common breath, to be an infidell; in whose beleefe, and doer of their contrary Actions, is to be religious in the right, and to merit if it were possible by good workes. The Poet, as that Laurell Maia dreamed of, is made by miracle from his mothers wombe, and like the Diamond onely polished and pointed of himselfe, disdaining the file and midwifery of forraine helpe. Hence Tullie was long ere he could be deliuered of a few verses, and those poore ones too: and Ovid , so backeward in prose, that he could almost speake nothing but verse. And Experience daily affordeth vs many excellent yong and growing wits, as well from Plow as the Pallace, endued naturally with this Diuine and heauenly guift, yet not knowing (if you should aske the question) whether a Metaphore be flesh or fish. It bare saying Poetrie is an heauenly gift, be too weake a proppe to vphold her credite with those buzzardly  34 poore ones, who hauing their feathers moulted can creepe no farther then their owne puddle , able onely to enuie this Imperiall Eagle for sight and flight; let them if they can looke backe to all antiquitie, and they shall finde all learning by diuine instinct to breathe from her bosome, as  35 both Plato and Tullie in his Tusculanes affirme. Strabo saith, Poetrie was the first Philosophie that euer was taught, nor were there euer any writers thereof knowne before Mus aeus, Hesiod and Homer : by whose authorities Plato, Aristotle and Galen , determine their weightiest controuersies, and confirme their reasons in Philosophie. And what were the songs of Linus, Orpheus, Amphion, Olympus , and that dittie I opas sang to his harpe at Dido's banquet, but Naturall and Morall Philosophie, sweetened with the pleasaunce of Numbers, that Rudenesse and Barbarisme might the better taste and digest the lessons of ciuilitie? according to Lucretius (Italianized by Ariosto ) and englished by Sir John Harrington , Sed veluti pueris absynthia tetra medentes, Cum dare conantur, pri us or as pocula circuns Contingunt mellis, dulci flavogs, liquore, Vt puerorum aet as improvida ludificetur, &c. As Leaches when for children they appoint, Their bitter worme-wood potions, first the cup About the brimme with honnie sweete they noint, That so the childe, beguild may drinke it vp, &c. Neither hath humane knowledge beene the onely subiect of this Diuine Art, but euen the highest Mysteries of Diuinitie. What are the Psalmes of Dauid (which S. Hillarie 36 so aptly compareth to a bunch of keies, in regard of the seuerall doores, whereby they giue the soule entrance, either to Prayer, Reioycing, Repentance, Thanksgiuing,  &c.) but a Diuine Poeme, going sometime in one measure, sometime in another? What liuely descriptions are there of the Maiestie of God, the estate and securitie  37 of Gods children, the miserable condition of the wicked?  38 What liuely similitudes & comparisons, as the righteous  39 man to a baie tree, the Soule to a thirstie Hart, vnitie to oyntment, and the dew of Hermon ? What excellent Allegories, as the vine planted in  Ægypt; what Epiphonema's, prosopopoea's and whatsoeuer else may be required, to the texture of so rich and glorious a peece? And the song of Salomon (which is onely lest vs of a thousand) is it not a continued Allegorie of the Mysticall loue betwixt Christ and his Church ? Moreouer the Apostles themselues haue not disdained to alledge the authoritie of the heathen Poets, Aratus, Menander and Epimenides ; as also the fathers of the Church, Nazianzen , S. Augustine, Bernard, Prudentius , with many others, beside the allowance they haue giuen of Poetrie, they teach vs the true vse and end thereof, which is to compose the Songs of Sion , and addresse the fruite of our inuention to his glorie who is the author of so goodly a gift, which we abuse to our loues, light fancies, and basest affections. And if Mechanicall Arts hold their estimation by their effects in base subiects, how much more deserueth this to be esteemed, that holdeth so soueraigne a power ouer the minde, can turne brutishnesse into Ciuilitie, make the lewd honest (which is Scaligers opinion of Virgils Poeme) turne hatred to loue, cowardise into valour, and in briefe, like a Queene command ouer all affections? Moreouer the Muse, Mirth, Graces , and perfect Health , haue euer an affinitie each with either. I remember Plutarch telleth vs of Telesilla , a noble and braue Ladie, who being dangerously sicke, and imagined past recouerie, was by the Oracle, aduised to apply her minde to the Muse and Poetrie; which shee diligently obseruing recouered in a short space, and withall grew so sprightly couragious, that hauing well fortified Argos with diuers companies of women onely, her selfe with her c opanions fallying out, entertained Cleomenes K. of the Laced aemonias with such a Camisado , that he was faine to shew his back, leauing a good part of his people behinde, to fill ditches; and then by plaine force of Armes draue out Demaratus another king, who lay very strong in garrison within. Alexander by the reading of Homer , was especially mooued to goe thorough with his conquests. Leonidas also that braue King of the Spartanes , being asked how Tirt aeus (who wrote of warre in verse) was esteemed among Poets, replied excellently: For my souldiers, quoth he, mooued onely with his verses, runne with a resolute courage to the battaile, fearing no perill at all. What other thing gaue an edge to the valour of our ancient Britons, but their Bardes (remembred by Athen aeus, Lucan and sundry other,) recording in verse the braue exploits of their nation, and singing the same vnto their Harpes at their publike seasts and meetings? amongst whom Taliessin a learned Bard, and Master to Merlin , sung the life and actes of King Arthur. Hence hath Poetry neuer wanted her Patrones, and euen the greatest Monarches and Princes, as well Christian as Heathen, haue exercised their Inuention herein: as that great Glorie of Christendome Charlemaine , who among many other things, wrote his Nephew Roulands Epitaphe, after he was slaine in a battell against the Sarracens , among the  40 Pyren aean hills: Alphonsus King of Naples , whose onely delight was the reading of Virgil: Robert King of Sicilie ; and that thrice renowned and learned French King, who finding Petrarchs Toombe without any inscription or Epitaphe, wrote one himselfe, (which yet remaineth) saying; Shame it was, that be who sung his Mistresse praise seauen yeares besore her death, and twelue yeares should want an Epitaphe . Among the Heathen are eternized for their skill in Poesie, Augustus C aesar, Octauius, Adrian, Germanicus. 41 Euery child knoweth how deare the workes of Homer were vnto Alexander, Euripides to Amyntas King of Macedon , Uirgil to Augustus, Theocritus to Ptolomey and Berenice , King and Queene of Æ gypt : the stately Pindar to Hiero King of Sicilie, Ennius to Scipio, Ausonius to Gratian , (who made him Pro-consull:) in our owne Countrey,  a Chaucer to Richard the second, Gower to  42 Henrie the fourth, with others I might alledge. The Lady Anne of Bretaigne , who was twice French Queene, passing through the Presence in the Court of France , espying Chartier the Kings Secretarie, and a famous Poet, leaning vpon his elbow at a Tables and fast asleepe, shee stooping downe, and openly kissing him, said; We must honour with our kisse, the mouth from whence so many sweete verses and golden Poems haue proceeded. But some may aske me, How it falleth out, that Poets now adaies are of no such esteeme, as they haue beene in former times? I answere, because vertue in our declining and worser daies, generally findeth no regard: Or rather more truly with Aretine (being demaunded why Princes were not so liberall to Poesie, and other good Arts, as in former times) Because their conscience telleth them, how unworthy they are of the praises giuen them by Poets; as for other Arts, they make no account of that they know not. But since we are heere (hauing before ouer-runne the Champaigne and large field of Historie) let vs a while rest our selues in the garden of the Muses, and admire the bountie of heauen, in the seuerall beauties of so many diuine and fertile wits. We must beginne with the King of Latine Poets , whom Nature hath reared beyond imitation, and who aboue all other onely, deserueth the name of a Poet; I meane Virgil . In him you shall at once finde (not else-where) that Prudence, Efficacie, Uarietie , and Sweetnesse , which Scaliger 43 requireth in a Poet, and maketh his prime vertues. Vnder Prudence is comprehended out of generall learning and iudgement, that discreete, apt suting and disposing, as well of Actions as Words in their due place, time and manner; which in Virgil is not obserued by one among twentie of our ordinary Grammarians, who (to vse the words of the Prince of learning hereupon) onely 44 in shallow and small Boates, glide ouer the face of the Virgilian Sea  . How diuinely, according to the Platonickes , doth he discourse of the Soule? how properly of the Nature, number of winds, seasons of the yeare, qualities of Beasts, Nature of Hearbs? What in-sight into ancient Chronologie and Historie ? In briefe, what not worthy the knowledge of a diuine wit? To make his Æ neas a man of extraordinary aspect, and comlinesse of personage, he makes Venus both his mother and Ladie of his Horoscope . And forasmuch as griefe and perpetuall care, are inseparable companions of all great and noble atchieuements, he giues him Achates quasi ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , his faithfull companion? What immooued constancy, when no teares or entreaty of Eliza could cause him stay? What Piety, Pitty, Fortitude , beyond his companions. See how the Diuine Poet gaue him leaue to be wounded, lest his valour in so many skirmishes might bee questioned, and that a farre off, not at hand, that rather it might be imputed to his Fortune, then his rashnesse or weaknesse; then by one who could not be knowne, to giue the enemie occasion rather of feare, then of challenging the glorie. And whereas he bringeth in Camilla , a couragious Lady, and inuincible at the Swords point in encountring other; yet he neuer bringeth her to try her valour with Aeneas . Againe,  45 that Tarchon and she might shew their braue deeds he makes Aeneas absent: as also when Turnus so resolutely brake into his Tents. Lastly, what excellent iudgment sheweth he in appropriating the accidents and Histories of his owne times, to those of the ancient, as where he bringeth in Venulus plucked by force from his Horse, and carried away with full speed? The like C aesar confesseth to haue happened to himselfe. Aeneas with his right arme naked, commaunds his Souldiers to abstaine fro slaughter. The like did C aesar at the battaile of Pharsalie , and with the same words. But thus much out of the  46 heape and most iudicious obseruations of the most learned Scaliger. Efficacie is a power of speech, which representeth a thing after an excellent manner, neither by bare words onely, but by presenting to our minds the liuely Id aea's or formes of things so truly, as if wee saw them with our eyes; as the places in Hell , the fierie Arrow of Acesta , the description of Fame , the flame about the Temples of Ascanius : but of actions more open, and with greater Spirit, as in that passage and passion of Dido , preparing  47 to kill herselfe. At trepida & coeptis immanibus effera Dido, Sanguineam voluens aciem, maculisq trementes Interfusa genas, & pallida morte futura, Interiora domus irrumpit limina, & altos Conscendit furibunda rogos, ensemq recludit Dardanium, &c. Which for my English Readers sake, I haue after my manner translated, though assured all the translations in the world must come short of the sweetnesse and Maiesty of the Latine. But she amazd and fierce by cruell plots, Rouling about her bloody eye, her cheekes All-trembling and arising, full of spots, And pale with death at hand, perforce she breakes Into the in-most roomes. Enraged then she climbes the loftie pile, And out of sheath the Dardane sword doth draw: Ne're for such end ordained; when a while The Troian garments, and knowne couch she saw, With trickling teares her selfe thereon she cast, And hauing paus'd a little, spake her last. Sweete spoiles, while Fates and Heauens did permit, Receiue this soule, and rid me of my cares; What race my Fortune gaue I finish'd it, &c. Moreouer, that liuely combat betweene Nisus and Volscens , with many other of most excellent life. A sweete verse is that, which like a dish with a delicate  48 Sauce, inuites the Reader to taste euen against his will; the contrarie is harshnesse: hereof I giue you an example in the description of young Pallas (whom imagine you see laid forth newly slaine vpon a Biere of Crabtree and Oken rods, couered with Straw, and arched ouer with greene boughes) then which no Nectar can be more delicious. Qualem virgineo demessum pollice florem ,  49 Seu mollis viol ae, seu languentis Hyacinthi, Cui nec fulgor adhuc, nec dum sua forma recessit, Noniam mater alit tellus viresq ministrat, &c. Euen as the Flower by Maidens finger mowne, Of th'drooping Hy'cinth, or soft Violet, Whose beautie's fading, yet not fully gone; Now mother Earth no more doth nourish it, &c. The like of faire Eurialus breathing his last. Purpureus veluti cum flos succisus aratro, 50 Languescit moriens, lassove papauera collo Demisere caput, pluvia cum fort e gravantur. Looke how the purple Flower, which the Plow Hath shorne in sunder, languishing doth die; Or Poppies downe their wearie neckes do bow, And hang the head, with raine when laden lie, &c. This kind, Plutarch tearmeth Flowery , as hauing in it  51 a beautie and sweete grace to delight, as a Flower. Uarietie , is various, and the rules of it so difficult, that to define or describe it, were as to draw one picture which should resemble all the faces in the world, changing it selfe like Proteus into all shapes: which our Diuine Poet so much, and with such excellent art affecteth, that seldome or neuer he vttereth words, or describeth actions spoken or done after the same manner, though they be in effect the same; yea, though the conclusion of all the Bookes of his Æ neides bee Tragicall, saue the first; yet are they so tempered and disposed with such varietie of accidents, that they bring admiration to the most diuine iudgements: among them all not one like another, saue the ends of Turnus and Mezentius . What  52 varietie in his battailes, assailing the enemies Campe, besieging Cities, broyles among the common people, set battailes in fields, aides of horse and foot?  &c. Neuer the same wounds, but giuen with diuers weapons, as heere one is wounded or slaine with a peece of a Rock, a Flint, Fire-brand, Club, Halberd, Long pole: there another with a drinking Boule or Pot, a Rudder, Dart, Arrow, Lance, Sword,  53 Bals of Wildfire, &c. In diuers places, as the throat, head, thigh, breast, hip, hand, knee, before, behind, on the side, standing, lying, running, flying, talking, sleeping, crying out, entreating. Of place, as in the field, in the Tents, at Sacrifice, vpon the guard, in the day time, in the night. To proceede further, were to translate Virgil himselfe; therefore hitherto of varietie. I forbeare his most liuely descriptions of persons, times, places, and manner; his most sweete and proper Similitudes, as where he resembleth Æ neas , who could not be mooued by any entreatie or teares of Dido , or her Sister Anna , to a stubborne Oake after this manner. At veluti annosam valido cum robore quercum, Alpini Borea nunc hinc, nunc flatibus illinc ,  54 Eruere inter se certant; it stridor, & alte Consternunt terram concusso stipite frondes, &c. As when the Alpine winds with each contend, Now this, now that way, with their furious might, Some aged Oake vp by the rootes to rend, Lowd whistling's heard, the earth bestrewed quite (The body reeling) all about with leaues: While it stands firme, and irremoued cleaues Vnto the Rocke; for looke how high it heaues The lostie head to heauen-ward, so low The stubborne roote doth downe to hell-ward grow. Againe, that elegant comparison of Aruns (hauing cowardly slaine the braue Ladie Camilla , and retired himselfe for feare, into the body of the Armie) to a Wolfe that had done a mischiefe, and durst not shew his head. At velut ille prius quem tela inimica sequantur, 55 Continu o in montes sese auius abdidit altos Occiso pastore Lupus, magnove iuvenco Conscius audacis facti, caudamq remulcens Subiecit pauitantem vtero, sylvasq petiuit, &c. And as a Wolfe that hath the Shepheard slaine, Or some great beast, before the Countrey rise, Knowing him guiltie, through by-waies amaine Hath got the Mountaines, leering where he lies, Or clapt his taile betwixt his legges, in feare Tane the next Coppise, till the Coast be cleare. After Virgil , I bring you Ouid , as well because they liued  56 in one time, (yet Ouid consesseth he saw Virgil but  57 once in all his life) as that he deserueth to be second in imitation, for the sweetnesse and smooth current of his stile, euery where seasoned with profound and antique learning: among his Workes, his Epistles are most worthy your reading, being his nearest peece, euery where embellished with excellent and wise Sentences; the numbers smoothly falling in, and borrowing their lustre and beautie from imitation of natiue and antique Simplicitie: that of Acontius is somewhat too wanton; those three, of Ulysses, Demophoon , and Paris to Oenone , are suspected for the weaknesse of conceit, in regard of the other, to be none of Ouids. Concerning his bookes, Amorum and de Arte amandi , the wit with the truly ingenuous and learned will beare out the wantonnesse: for with the weeds there are delicate flowers in those walkes of Venus . For the Argument of his Metamorphosis , he is beholden to Parthenius , and diuers others, and those who long before wrote of the same subiect. About the yeare 1581 when the King of Poland made  58 warre in Moscouia , certaine Polonian Embassadours trauailing into the in- most places of Moscouia , as farre as Podolia and Kiouia : they passed the great Riuer Boristhenes , hauing in their company a certaine young Gentleman, very well seene in the Latine, Greeke, and Hebrew tongues; withall, an excellent Poet and Historian: he perswaded the Polonians to well horse themselues, and ride with him a little further; for he would (said he) shew them Ouids Sepulcher; which they did: and when they were gone six daies iourney beyond Boristhenes , through most vaste and desolate places, at last they came into a most sweete and pleasant valley, wherein was a cleere running Fountaine, about which the grasse growing very thicke and high, with their Swords and Fauchions they cut it downe, till at last they found a Stone, Chest, or Coffin, couered ouer with stickes and shrubs, whereon, it being rubbed and cleansed from Mosse and filth, they read Ouids Epitaph, which was this: H ic situs est vates, quem Diui Caesaris ira Augusti, Latia cedere iussit humo: S aepe miser voluit Patrijs occumbere terris, Sed frustr a: hunc illi fata dedere locum. This his Sepulcher (saith mine Authour) remaineth vpon the borders of Greece , neere to the Euxine Sea, and is yet to be seene. Of Lyricke Poets, as well Greeke as Latine, hold Horace 59 in highest account, as the most acute and artificiall of them all, hauing attained to such height, that to the discreete iudgement, he hath cut off all hope of equalizing him: his Stile is elegant, pure and sinewie, with most wittie and choice sentences, neither humili contentus Stylo (as Quintilian saith of him) sed grandiloquo & sublimi . Yea and if we beleeue Scaliger , more accurate and sententious then Pindar . His Odes are of most sweete and pleasant inuention, beyond all reprehension, euery where illustred with sundrie and rare figures, and verses so fluent, that the same Scaliger protesteth he had rather be a composer  60 of the like, then be King of whole Arragon . In his Satyres he is quicke, round and pleasant, and as nothing so bitter, so not so good as Iuvenal : his Epistles are neate; his Poetica his worst peece, for while he teacheth the Art, he goeth vnartificially to worke, euen in the verie beginning. Iuvenal of Satyrists is the best, for his Satyres are far  61 better then those of Horace , and though he be sententiously tart, yet is his phrase cleare and open. Persius , I know not why we should so much affect him,  62 since with his obscuritie hee laboureth not to affect vs; yet in our learned age he is now discouered to euery Schoole-boie: his stile is broken, froward, vnpleasing and harsh. In Martial you shall see a diuine wit, with a flowing  63 puritie of the Latine tongue, a true Epigrammatist: his verse is cleare, full, and absolute good, some few too wanton and licentious, being winked at. Lucane breathes with a great spirit, wherefore some of  64 our shallow Grammarians, haue attempted to equall him with Uirgil : but his errour is, while hee doth ampullare with bigge sounding words, and a conceipt vnbounded, furious and ranging, and cannot with Virgil containe himselfe within that sweete, humble and vnaffected moderation; he incurreth a secret enuie and ridiculous contempt, which a moderate and well tempered style auoideth. Seneca , for Maiestie and state yeeldeth not to any of  65 the Grecians whosoeuer, Cultu & nitore , to vse Scaligers words, farre excelling Euripides : and albeit he borrowed the Argument of his Trag aedies from the Graecians, yet the Spirit, lostinesse of sound, and Maiestie of stile is meerely his owne. Claudian , is an excellent and sweete Poet, onely ouerborne by the meannesle of his subject, but what wanted  66 to his matter he supplied by his wit and happie inuention. Statius is a smooth and a sweete Poet, comming neerest  67 of any other to the state and Maiestie of Virgils verse, and Virgil onely excepted, is the Prince of Poets aswell Greekes as Latine; for he is more flowery in figures, and writeth better lines then Homer . Of his works his Sylu ae are the best. Propertius is an easie cleare and true Elegiacke, following  68 the tract of none saue his owne inuention. Among Comicke Poets, how much antiquitie attributed  69 to Plautus for his pleasant veine (to whom Volcatius giueth the place next to C aeilius , and Uarro would make the mouth of Muses) so much doe our times yeeld to Terence ,  70 for the puritie of his stile: wherefore Scaliger willeth vs to admire Plantus as a Comoedian, but Terence as a pure and elegant speaker. Thus haue I in briefe, comprised for your behoofe, the large censure of the best of Latine Poets, as it is copiously deliuered by the Prince of all learning and Iudge of iudgements, the diuine Iul. C aes. Scaliger . But while we looke backe to antiquitie, let vs not forget our later and moderne times (as imagining nature hath here to fore extracted her quintessence, and left vs the dregges) which produce as fettile wits, as perhaps the other, yea and in our Brittaine. Of Latine Poets of our times in the iudgement of Beza and the best learned, Buchanan is esteemed the cheife:  71 who albeit in his person, behauiour, and fashion, he was rough hewen, slouenly and rude, seldome caring for a better outside then a Rugge-gowne girt close about him, yet his inside and conceipt in Poesie was most rich, and his sweetnesse, and facilitie in a verse, vnimitably excellent, as appeareth by that Master peece his Psalmes ; as farre beyond those of B. Rhenanus , as the Stanza's of Petrarch 72 the rimes of Skelton : but deseruing more applause (in my opinion) if hee had fallen vpon another subiect; for I say with one, Mihi spiritus diuinus eiusmodi placet quo seipsum ingessit a Patre, & illoru piget qui Dauid Psalmos suis calamistris inustos sperarant efficere plausibiliores . And certaine in that boundlesse field of Poeticall inuention, it cannot be anoided, but something must be distorted beside the intent of the Diuine enditer. His Tragedies are loftie, the stile pure, his Epigrams not to be mended, saue heere and there (according to his Genius) too broad and bitter. But let vs looke behinde vs, and wee shall finde one English-bred (whose glorie and worth, although Cineri 73 supp osta doloso  ) is inferiour neither to Buchanan , or any of the ancients, and so much the more to be valued, by how much the brighter he appeared out of the fogges of Barbarisme and ignorance in his time; that is, loseph of Exeter , who liued vnder Henrie the 2. and Richard the first, who wrote that singular and stately Poeme of the Troian warre, after the Historie of Dares Phrygius , which the Germanes haue printed vnder the name of Cornelius Nepos . He died at Bourdeaux in France , where he was Archbishop, where his monument is yet to bee seene. After him (all that long tract of ignorance, vntill the daies of Henrie the 8. (which time Erasmus calleth, the Golden Age of learning , in regard of so many famously learned men, it produced more then euer heretofore) flourished Sir Thomas More , sometime Lord Chancellor  74 of England : a man of most rich and pleasant inuention: his verse fluent, nothing harsh, constrained or obscure; wholly composed of conceipt, and inoffensiue mirth, that he seemeth ad lep ores fuisse natum . How wittily doth hee play vpon the Arch-cuckold Sabinus , scoffe at Frenchified Lalus , and Heruey a French cowardly Captaine, beaten at the Sea by our English, and his shippe burned, yet his victorie and valour to the English disgrace, proclaimed by Brixius a Germane Pot-aster ? What can be more loftie then his gratulatorie verse to King Henrie vpon his Coronation day? more wittie then that Epigramme vpon the name of Nicolaus an ignorant Phisitian, that had beene the death of thousands, and Abyngdons Epitaph? more sweete then that nectar Epistle of his, to his daughters Margaret, Elizabeth , and Cicelie ? But as these ingenious exercises bewraied in him an extraordinary quicknesse of wit and learning, so his Vtopia his depth of iudgment in State-affaires, then which, in the opinion of the most learned Bud aeus in a preface, before it our age hath not seene a thing more deepe & accurate. In his younger yeeres, there was euer a friendly and vertuous emulati on, for the palme of inuention and poesie, betweene William Lillie the author of our Grammer, and him, as  75 appeareth by their seuerall translations of many Greeke Epigrammes, and their inuention tried vpon one subiect; notwithstanding they lou'd and liu'd together as deerest friends. Lillie also was beside, an excellent Latine Poet, a singular Gr aecian; who after he trauelled all Greece ouer, and many parts of Europe beside, and liued some foure or fiue yeeres, in the Ile of the Rhodes : he returned home, and by Iohn Collet Deane of Paules , was elected Master of Pauls Schoole, which he had newly founded. Shortly after, began to grow eminent, aswell for Poesie as all other generall learning, Sir Thomas Challoner 76 Knight (father to the truly honest, and sometime louer of all excellent parts, Sir Thomas Challoner , who attended vpon the late Prince) borne in London , brought vp in Cambridge ; who hauing left the Vniuer sitie, and followed the Court a good while, went ouer with Sir Henry Knyuet , Embassadour to Charles the fift, as his friend and companion: what time the Emperour being preparing a mightie fleete against the Turkes in Argier , the English Embassadour, Sir Thomas Challoner, Henry Knowles , M. Henry Isam , and others, went in that seruice as voluntaries with the Emperour. But the Galley wherein Sir Thomas Challoner was, being cast away by foulenesse of weather, after he had laboured by swimming for his life as long as he was able, and the strength of his armes failing him, he caught hold vpon a cable throwne out from another galley, to the losse and breaking of many of his teeth, and by that meanes saued his life. After the death of King Henry the 8. he was in the battaile of Muskleborough , and knighted by the Duke of Sommerset . And in the beginning of the raigne of Queene Elizabeth , hee went ouer Embassadour into Spaine , where at his houres of leisure, he compiled ten elegant bookes in Latinevers. de Repub. Anglorum instauranda : superuised after his death by Malim , and dedicated to the old Lord Burghley , Lord Treasurer. Being sent for home, by her Maiestie, he shortly after died in London , and was buried in Paules neere to the steppes of the Quire, toward the South-doore, vnder a faire marble; but the brasse and epitaphe written by Doctor Haddon , by sacrilegious hands is since torne away. But the Muse and Eternall Fame haue reared him a monument more lasting and worthy the merit of so excellent a man. Of English Poets of our owne Nation, esteeme Sir  77 Geoffrey Chaucer the father; although the stile for the antiquitie, may distast you, yet as vnder a bitter and rough rinde, there lyeth a delicate kernell of conceit and sweete inuention. What Examples, Similitudes, Times, Places, and aboue all, Persons, with their speeches, and attributes, doe as in his Canterburie tales (like these threds of gold, the rich Arras ) beautifie his worke quite thorough? And albeit diuers of his workes, are but meerely translations out of Latine and French , yet he hath handled them so artificially, that thereby he hath made them his owne, as his Troilus and Cresseid . The Romant of the Rose, was the Inuention of Iehan de Mehunes , a French Poet, whereof he translated but onely the one halfe: his Canterburie -tales without question were his owne inuention, all circumstances being wholly English. Hee was a good Diuine, and saw in those times, without his spectacles, as may appeare by the Plough-man, and the Parsons tale: withall an excellent Mathematician, as plainly appeareth by his discourse of the Astrolabe to his little sonne Lewes . In briefe, account him among the best of your English bookes in your librarie. Gower being very gracious with King Henrie the 4.  78 in his time carried the name of the onely Poet, but his verses to say truth, were poore and plaine, yet full of good and graue Moralitie: but while he affected altogether the French phrase and words, made himself too obscure to his Reader; beside his inuention commeth farre short of the promise of his Titles. He published onely (that I know of) three bookes, which at S. Marie Oueries in Southwarke vpon his monument lately repaired by some good Benefactor, lie vnder his head; which are, Vox clamantis , Speculum Meditantis , and Confessio Amantis . He was a Knight, as also was Chaucer. After him succeeded Lydgate , a Monke of Burie , who  79 wrote that bitter Satyre of Peirs Plow-man . He spent most part of his time in translating the workes of others, hauing no great inuention of his owne. He wrote for those times a tollerable and smooth verse. Then followed Harding , and after him Skelton , a Poet  80 Laureate , for what desert I could neuer heare; if you desire to see his veine and learning, an Epitaph vpon King Henry the seauenth, at West- minster will discouer it. In the latter end of King Henrie the 8. for their excellent facultie in Poesie were famous, the right noble  81 Henrie Earle of Surrey (whose Songs and Sonnets yet extant, are of sweete conceipt:) and the learned, but vnfortunate, Sir Thomas Wyat. 82 In the time of Edward the sixth liued Sternhold , whom King Henry his father, a little before had made groome of his Chamber, for turning certaine of Dauids Psalmes into verse:and merrie Iohn Heywood , who wrote  83 his Epigrammes, as also Sir Thomas More his Vtopia , in the parish wherein I was borne; where either of them dwelt, and had faire possessions. About Queene Maries time, flourished Doctor Phaer who in part translated Virgils Æneids , after finished by Arthur Golding. In the time of our late Queene Elizabeth , which was truly a golden Age (for such a world of refined wits, and excellent spirits it produced, whose like are hardly to be hoped for, in any succeeding Age) aboue others, who honoured Poesie with their pennes and practise (to omit her Maiestie, who had a singular gift herein) were Edward Earle of Oxford , the Lord Buckhurst, Henry Lord Paget ; our Phoenix , the noble Sir Philip Sidney , M. Edward Dyer , M. Edmund Spencer , M. Samuel Daniel , with sundry others; whom (together with those admirable wits, yet liuing, and so well knowne) not out of Enuie, but to auoide tediousnesse I ouerpasse. Thus much of Poetrie.
