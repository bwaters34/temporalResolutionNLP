 as in their Relation; And having done so much against hir, I could only but this way, doe something in Proportion for hir; They Further added, if my writings needed no Protection, they were fittest for your fight, and if they needed any, you were ablest to give it. And tho to all this, I represented, That if their Ambition of being known Madam unto You, had not entirely silenc't their Iustice, they could not have believ'd a Cryme against You, could have Prov'd an obligation to Them; And that in my thus obeying them, I should necessitate many to conclude I had an Endless Quarrell to those which were the most Perfect of your sex, by Injuring such of them as are Dead, in my Book; as such of them as are Alive in the Dedications of it. Against This, they enjoyn'd me to Remember the Example of that Excellent Genius, who Presented you his Oblations under the Faire Name of Sacharissa, who was guiltie of both those Crymes (writing Of you and To you) only to Please himself, of which they sollicited me, to be Guiltie but only of One, (and that also the least) to Please and Repair them, and yet was not only Pardon'd, but admited the high Honor of your Conversation. But Madam tho I were Concern'd to say little against my obedience to them, the more to invite You to Pardon it, as being an Offence of Ignorance, rather than Knowledge; yet I could not but let them know, I consider'd that usage Madam of yours, was only more and more to convince him of the greatness of his Crime, and of the Greatness of that Mercy which had Pardon'd it. That Cloude of Sacharissa, which some ascribe to his Modestie, I do to his Iudgment; for thereby he was believ'd a Perfect Discriber of Fancie, whereas otherwise he would have bin known a Defective Discriber of Truth. Yet I must say the Greatest Fault he Committed in attempting your Character, was his attempting it; for in the Necessitie of his Cryme he had this Satisfaction, That whoever had assum'd his Designe, must have committed his Offence, and come as short of Him, as (almost) He has of you. For Madam you are above being Discrib'd, which Condition, tho it be the most unhappie as to us, yet is the Noblest as to you; & consequently we cannot Deplore an Ignorance, which is occasion'd by a Perfection, that even in Degrees transcends it. I hope a part of it will be manifested in forgiving a Confidence, which is impos'd, and not sought; and has indeed no Title to your Mercie, but that is great enough for it; which tho Infinite cannot exceed the Ioy with which it will be Receiv'd, nor the Truth which Presumes Madam to tell you that I am Your most humble, most faithfull, and most obedient servant. PARTHENISSA. THE SECOND PARTE THE FIRST BOOKE. was very tine; for whilst the last was acquainting the first with his generous Princes Adventures, he himselfe (as has bin related) was retir'd into a solitude which that morning he had discover'd, where (by Fortunes giveing him some ease, the better to enable him to support hir longer cruelties) he was fallen into a slumber, and though his cares were so vnusually civill, as not to interrupt it, yet it was suddenly, by a noyse of Horses, & clashing of Swords, and Armes, which reacht his Eare, which invited him to take his Horse, & gallopp to the place from whence this Allarme came, to learne the subject of it; the continuance of the noyse, and the swiftnesse of his horse, faithfully & suddenly brought him to see a Combate which struck him both with admiration, & anger, the first was caus'd by a single Valour, which could not be but transcendent, since it had such an Admirer, and the last was occasion'd, by six Arm'd Men which endeauour'd to destroy the possessor of it, who to sell his Life at a rate worthy so high a purchase, and to make his Enemyes deplore the destruction of so great a Courage, or the effects of it, had already kill'd two of them, with blowes that struck as great a terror into the rest, as the very example of those Deaths; but finding at last that his Courage might be worsted by, though not yeeld to his Enemyes Numbers, he was retir'd to a litle Thickett that shelter'd him behinde, and his Horse being kill'd in the retreate, defended his right side, doeing him service even after death, 'twas in this litle fortification, and posture, Artabbanes found him, and there being no greater invitation to his generous Minde for the releiveing of virtue, than to finde it in distresse, he instantly tooke up one of the dead Mens helmetts, to joyne himselfe to the opprest stranger, who (as he was comeing full speede towards him) thinkeing the now wearer of the Helmett, asmuch his Enemy, as he that had so lately worne it, cry'd out to Artabbanes make haste, make haste, & helpe those, whose hearts are as ill as their Cause, & who neede rely on their Number, since they cannot on their Quarrell. Our Hero esteem'd it more handsome, & necessary to shew the generous stranger his error by his actions, than words, & at his first stroakes so abundantly did it, that he which he releiu'd, thought his mistake a greater misfortune, than that which he had now more than hopes to be free'd from & indeed Artabbanes perform'd things so farre above his strength, though not himselfe, that three of the surviveing fower, left the Sranger to employ their Swords against an Enemy, who they concluded would render the odds as needefull, as it was disproportionate; but the valiant Stranger findeing he had to deale but with one, and that his releife might endanger the bestower of it, suddenly abandon'd his intrenchment, and as suddenly made his adversary abandon his Life, but his Horse he made use of to assist his vnknowne freind, who was alreaddy in a condition not to neede it, for he had kill'd one of the three, & the other two perceiveing how powerfull an addition was comeing, endeavour'd in their Horses feere, to finde a security they despair'd of from their owne hands: Artabbaes and the Stranger follow'd them a while, but findeing more difficulty in the chase, than the Quarry meritted, and that the way they had taken to avoyde their resentments, render'd them vnworthy of them, they gave over the pursuite, and then the Stranger having with asmuch grace, as civility, begg'd a Pardon from Artabbanes, for a mistake created by the Armes he had onn, told him, Though my Life is rather a misfortune, than the contrary, yet my obligation to my Deliverer is nothing inferior, and what my miseries made me desirous to lose (though not in so vnhandsome a way) my gratitude now obliges me to preserve, since I esteeme the Giver of my Life, has too great a share, and title in it, to dispose of it without him. Artabbanes extreamly satisfy'd with so obligeing a Civility, told the maker of it; I have (generous Stranger) as little title to your Life, as to your releife, & if by drawing my Sword in your quarrell, I have done any thing, it deserues rather your resentment, than your thankes, since I have contributed but to a victory that was certaine without my asistance, and vnder a pretence of serveing you, robb'd you in part of a Glory, which your Courage only had wonne. Were not your performance (the Stranger reply'd) of a quality that manifest's you injure your actions when you decline their meritt, I might as easily evince that Truth, as acknowledge it, & if you refuse that present I offer you (as having receiv'd it from you) I shall esteeme your declineing it as high a misfortune, as any that has made me esteeme my Life so. If (said Artabbanes) there be any obligation in what I have done, it wholly reflects upon me, that have more oblig'd my selfe than you, in serveing so prodigall a gratitude; but (he continu'd) perceiveing some blood dropping from the Strangers wounds, aswell as from his owne) let us not lose the benefitt of your safety, by disputeing who you deriv'd it from, and though I am a Stranger in these parts aswell as you, and asmuch your equall in misery, as you are my Superiour in those virtues, of which, that ought not to be the reward, yet I can offer you a retirement, 'till your health, or businesse, invites you to prosecute your Iourny. I am (reply'd the Stranger) so miserable a Creature, that nothing can increase my being so, but the beleife that you are a more; and though I accept of your Civility 'till my wounds be healed, yet I must begg your pardon if I first learne from whoe I receiv'd them. Are you (said Artabbanes) yet ignorant of that? Yes (said the Stranger) and cannot fancy, any that knowes me, and are my Enemyes, can be so much mistaken in their revenge, as to thinke killing me, is any. 'Twas such discourses as these that brought them where the markes of their Courages and Victory lay, where the Stranger pulling off all the Murtherers Helmetts, to learne if he knew any of them, found himselfe as ignorant in their Faces as in the cause of their malice; yet one of them by the benefitt of the Ayre and by the turning of his Body, faintly open'd his Eyes and being ask't of the Stranger who 'twas that had invited them to so vnfortunate, & vnjust an attempt, was only answer'd by halfe words, and sighes, 'twas the Prince of Parthia; and then he clos'd both them, and his lipps for ever. Whilst the stranger was thus employ'd about this dying Man, Artabbanes was about his companions, whose Soules were so long fledd from their guilty Bodyes, that all his paines and Art could not recall them; this made him returne to the vnknowne Gentleman, who he found (by that litle Intelligence he had gotten) almost as movelesse, as he that had given it him; but Artabbanes presence drew him from his amazement, and after he had fruitlessely endeavour'd to make a dead Man speake, he begg'd our Heroe's pardon for his necessary incivility, which had so long suspended his waiteing on him to that retirement, which he was now readdy to doe. Artabbanes obey'd this invitation, but observeing that he which made it, was more melancholly than he had bin, he desir'd to know whether he had newly learn'd any thing that caus'd it. Alas (Sir said the Stranger) I am inform'd who has attempted against my Life, & am involu'd by that knowledge in a higher confusion, than I was in, by my ignorance. Artabbanes perceiveing by what he had said, that he was not willing to explaine himselfe, alter'd the subject of his discourse, which he entertain'd him with, 'till they came to the Temple (the place as the Stranger said of his intended Iourny) where our Hero brought him to his owne Lodgings, and where they had no sooner pull'd off their Helmetts, than haveing a while gaz'd at each other with a mutuall and high admiration, they suddenly after rann to embrace with asmuch Ioy and satisfaction. One of the Goddesses Preists was present at this Adventure, who carry'd his Superiour the newes of it, and though at his departure the two Freinds were in one anothers Armes, yet He, Callimmachus, and Symander, found them still in the same posture; and because the Celebration of their joyes hinder'd them from takeing notice of this Company, the last of it, being vnwilling to interrupt a contentment, which he knew was as just as great, tooke the leasure to acquaint Callimmachus, that the Gentleman his Prince embrac't, was the generous Artavasdes, the beginning of whose Story he had learn'd from Artabbanes, and the service he had render'd him, was the subject of their last discourse. Callimmachus was highly satisfy'd to have at once in his house, more virtue than the world had besides; but whilst he was in the contemplation of that blesseing, the Chyrurgions which he had sent for, comeing in, interrupted it, and Artabbanes, and Artavasdes perceiveing how rude their joy had bin, repair'd it by a thousand excuses; but Callimmachus more intent on their healths, than their Civilities, broake, them off, to employ the Chirurgions, who haveing search't both their wounds, found them somwhat inflam'd, & that they might prove dangerous, vnlesse by quietnesse and silence, they would contribute to their recovery; & though Callimmachus had prepar'd a magnificent Appartment for Artauasdes, yet neither that, nor the Chirurgions prayers could invite them to a separation; nay 'twas with much difficulty that they extorted a promise from the Princes, not to speake to one another in fower & twenty howers, which they both profest was more troublesome to them than those wounds, to which their silence was to be a contributory cure Symander who knew his Prince was asmuch concearn'd in Artavasdes, as in himselfe; proportion'd his care accordingly, and the holy Preist by his transcendent diligence, manifested he knew the merit of his Guests; but the first tyme for their silence being expir'd, the Phisitians injoyn'd a second of the same continuance, which our Hero's would not have submitted unto, but upon a faithfull promise after that was efluxt, they should, & might without danger, entertaine one another. Callimmachus was as impatient at this new imposition, as they were, on whome it was impos'd; & though his curiosity was great, yet his civility was greater, which hinder'd him from desireing Symander to continue his narration, or from begging his Prince to comand it him. But the so much impatiented hower was no sooner come, than Artavasdes remou'd his Bedd, so neere to that of Artabbanes, that they might discourse as commodiously, as if they both had layn'e in one. There the generous Armenian began to exclaime against his Fortune, for having render'd his miseries contagious, & for having made the meanes of his deliverance, a greater misfortune, than the want of it could have prov'd. But Artabbanes tooke him up so short, and so civilly, for thincking those wounds a misfortune, which had secur'd his Freind, that Artavasdes by being forc'd to beleive them none, found them a greater. Callimmachus came in as the two Princes were in those discourses, and findeing them so employ'd, offer'd againe to retire; But Artabbanes had given his Freind so true a Carracter of him, that they joyntly assur'd him, his company could never prove an injury, but in his depriveing them of it. This (with their intreaties) stay'd him, and he being too much concearn'd in both their Lives not to be ambitious to learne the accidents which compos'd them, cast out some oblique words that manifested his curiosity which infinitly reviv'd Artabbanes'es, who remembring some sadd expressions, his Freind had us'd in their late meeteing, and being impatient to learne the whole, of what he knew but in part, begg'd him to satisfy both Callimmachus's, and his Prayers. Sir (said the virtuous Preist) since you have made my curiosity your request, I will let you know, that Symanders Story being interrupted by the generous Artavasdes arrivall, he cannot better repaire that injury, than in telling his owne, and to induce him the rather to it, I can truely assure him, I had learn'd a parte of it before now, had not he himselfe hinder'd it; for we were alreaddy so farre advanc't, as to your strange encounter at the Battell of the Trenches, and to your comeing to Rome. Artabbanes was somewhat troubl'd, that to satisfy Callimmachus, he must be necessitated to remaine a while ignorant of a fresh Intelligence, to listen unto one he knew, yet he was so perfectly interrested in all his Freinds actions, and in the respect due to so signall a Person, that he besought Artavasdes to begin his Adventures, from their seperation in Parthia, since 'till then Callimmachus had learn'd them from his Mouth. Artavasdes haveing first tyde the generous Parthia to repay his story, by acquainting him afterwards with his owne, began his obedience to his Freinds Commands, in these tearmes. yours, which I attest the Gods was a higher trouble to me, than the benefit I thereby enjoy'd was a satisfaction, I found in Rysolis by your comands, a continuance of your favours, who vnder the pretence of searching for me as farre as the confines of Armenia, was my Conuoy thither, where he dismist me, as sending me in the quality of a Spye, after my selfe. In my journy from thence towards Artaxata, in divers Townes I sawe many which deplor'd me for dead,  & found by the small services I had pay'd my King, & Country, I was much more esteem'd of, than either I thought, or meritted; I knowe not whether the vanity of repeateing those flattering sights, the desire of being at the Court before any knew of my being at liberty, or the providence of the Gods, made me continue my voyage in my disguise, but this I know, that had I cast it off, I had at the same tyme cast off my safety with it. The Cloathes I then wore, were a Common Troopers, so that a violent warre being kinled in Armenia, I past the Gates of Artaxata in that quality, without examination, and lighting at the Palace I went (to my admiration) to the Princesse's Appartment whithout meeteing any by the way, & the Dore of the Chamber being vnlock't I gently open'd it, where the reward of so large a confidence, was the sight of the faire Altezeera, and though I vnexpectedly made a litle noyse, yet hir thoughts were so obliquely intentive, that shee heard it not, and thereby gave me liberty to contemplate a Beauty, that had nothing in degrees equall to it, but the zeale, and passion with which I ador'd it; And truely I was so ravisht in the contemplation of so many perfections, that had not the Possessor of them, by hazard turning hir Eyes that way, taken me from my Rapture, I had longer continu'd in it; but assoone as I found to lengthen my felicity, was to lengthen my rudenesse, I cast my selfe at hir Feete, to begg a Pardon, for having continu'd it so long, and for haveing so much intrencht upon hir retirement. My voyce, & my actions chang'd the faire Altezeera's feare, into admiration, since a Souldiers comeing into hir Chamber, could not more create the former, than that Souldiers being Artavasdes, did the latter. Great Gods! when hir wonder was supprest, how liberally did shee reward the sufferings of my duty, and manifested so transcendent a joy for my deliverance, that the sight of it, inspir'd me with a greater, than the cause of it could my Princesse. There (generous Artabbanes) I told hir of your Gallantry, & that the same fortune I had had in Love, did follow me in Warre, since I ow'd my preservation to my Conqueror; but alas these cotentments were as short as their relation, for Altezeera assur'd me I was in more danger in Artaxata, than in the place from whence I came; that shee ho't by the Cloathes I woare I was not ignorant of it; and that I would more fully convince hir thereof by retireing to my Fathers Army. Madam (I reply'd somewhat surpriz'd) If what you last mention'd must be the evincement of that beleife, I feare 'twilbe also of my ruine, and if I must be banisht from my Princesse, & by hir, I shall be in greater danger in Armenia, than I was in in Parthia, since the consolation of my miseries there, is ravisht from me here; as for my disguize, 'twas rather by chance than designe, for I am as free from feare, as guilt; neither, doe I know the posture my Father, and the Kingdome is in, though as I travell'd I heard some discourse of both, but the information was so darke & confus'd, that it left me in as deepe an ignorance, as their silence could. I will tell you then (said Altezeera) that Anexander after some sharpe encounters with Zenazius (who you know, before your expedition into Parthia, had taken up Armes to revenge his Brother Celindus Death; and to maintaine his ambition, and quarrell) within these Tenn dayes, vnder the very walls of Nicapolis drew your Father to a pitcht Battell, in which his courage, and cause, gave him so entire a victory, that the markes of it were all the Rebells Colours, and the Feild pav'd with 35000 of their bodyes, the Reliques, with their Generall, saved themselves within that Citty, the Metropolis of the Rebellion, which Anexander the next morning beseidg'd, and from whence Zenaxtus sent a Trumpetter to let him know, he was desirous to treate, but it should be with his King, not his Conqueror. Anexander esteemed it his duty to informe Artabazus of this, and asmuch his duty to diswade him from accepting it, which the more to induce him to, he vndertooke in Thirty dayes, to send this capitulating Traytor to Artaxata, in a posture as lowe, as his condition, or hopes. These letters came three dayes since, and being debated in a generall Councell (which 'till then, since your imprisonment had not bin convened) Crassolis, and his party, by their old power, and inclinations, advis'd and perswaded my Brother, to goe post in person to Annexanders Campe, & there not only settle a Peace by a Treaty, or a Conquest, but also have the Glory of doeing it. This being determin'd & the Councell readdy to breake up, the generous Phanasder who by your favour succeeded Celindus in all his Commands, & Dignities, and consequently was of the highest Quality in this Assembly, earnestly motion'd, that some immediat course might be taken for restoreing you to that Liberty, you had so meritoriously and successefully lost; and that for the effecting there of Embassadors might be sent to Arsaces. The false Crassolis in a sett speech (being the mouth of the Councell) gave Phanasder an answer as handsome, as hippocriticall, for his care of so publique a concearnment, which to forgett (he said) was to be as vnmindfull of the generall Gratitude, as Safety. I tell you (said Artavasdes to Artabbanes) Altezeera's words, & Crassolis flattery] but (continu'd Crassolis) I am apprehensive that the way which Phanasder propounds, wilbe obstructiue to the end, which would be sooner reach't by a seemeing neglect of Artavasdes, than a reall & pressing solicitation for him, since I have ever observ'd, that the Parthians raise the value of what they possesse, by the value they know wee place on it. I must confesse (reply'd Phanasder) were Artavasdes performances of a quality that they could be conceal'd, there might be some appearance in Crassolis allegation, but since the very act which made him a Prisoner, makes him vnworthy to continue so, our neglecting his liberty, will looke too like a designe, not to be taken for one. These & many other reasons of Phanasders were so prevalent with my Brother, that he order'd Embassadors should be sent, and the care of sending them to Crassolis; The King thus declineing his advice, follow'd it; And Phanasder, who sawe it no tyme to dissemble told Artabazus so much, for which he receiv'd so severe a reprehension, that yesterday morning when my Brother tooke Post to goe to Annexanders Army, Phanasder retir'd unto Artemita, the cheife Towne of his Government. But that which brought no small accession to his discontent was, Artabazus leaveing the care of this Citty to Crassolis, and with it, that of two such considerable and dangerous Prisoners, as Tygranes, and Palisdes. But (continu'd Altezeera) that you may see my Brother was not sent from hence only to eclipse your Fathers Glory but also to raise that of Tygranes, I will acquaint you with an Intelligence as strange, as the manner of my learning it. You are not ignorant that Regeliza (my cheifest confident) has asmuch Iudgement, as Beauty, the last of which has so infinitly inflam'd Crassolis eldest Sonne, that he has not long since acquainted hir with what effects it has produc'd, & though hir virtues, and birth, might have made hir consider, and condemne that declaration as a Confidence, yet the power shee has over hir selfe, made hir suppresse all resentments of words, in hope to acquaint him with hirs in a more sensible way; the better to effect this, after by many artifices shee had induc'd the young Lover (who shee knew his Father doted on) to beleive, all hir doubts were, that his passion was rather an appearance, than a reallity, & that what confirm'd hir in that beleife was, his never comunicating any of those secretts, in which he was a principall Agent, & which he could not conceale were not his heart & words Srangers, Shee so admirably acted hir part, that this morning hir Servant, to silence hir reproaches & doubts, cleerely inform'd hir, that Artabazus was sent out of the way, but to place Tygranes in the Throne; That though Crassolis had not yet as great an influence over that young Prince, as over his Father yet he was confident of obtaineing it by the obligation of a Crowne, and of Liberty; That Artabazus was too easy to be a good Freind, & was as facile to be lost, as wonne; that on the contrary, though Tygranes was hard to be gain'd, yet being so, he was hardlyer lost; That Crassolis had done too much privatly, not to apprehend the discovery, & haveing meritted death, his adversaries were too-diligent, and too-considerable, not to feare it; That Annezander was so successefull, and powerfull, that either he would obtayne, or assume the Authority, either of which, would be his Fathers ruine; That Palisdes and Tygranes were perfectly reconcil'd, and had joyn'd their Interests; That Artabazus and Artavasdes absence; would give them the opportunity to be Governours, where they were Prisoners; and that Crassolis (to leave as litle in the power of Fortune as he could, and to seeme to follow what he lead) was to be made a Prisoner by his Freinds, to have this mutatio appeare his punishment, not his designe, thereby not to lose the Father, if the Sonne lost himselfe, and that all this was immediatly to be put in execution lest the delay of the conspiracy, might be the ruine of it. Regeliza seem'd to approve this Plott, lest hir Lover might have suspected shee condemn'd it, but he was no sooner gone then shee (being more faithfull to hir Mistris than hir Servant) came this Morning & accquainted me with what I have you, which was the cause of that deepe Melancholly you found me in, and which your presence here will continue, and increase. The faire Altezeera (said Artavasdes) had no sooner done speakeing than I found, that the Kings absence was the cause of so solitary a Court, that there was a providence in my disguize, that Artabazus was an Enemy to reason, and to gratitude, or to Artavasdes and that Phanasder was not to the two latter. 'Twas therefore that I humbly begg'd Altezeera to make Artemita hir Sanctuary, and not to expose hirselfe amongst those, to whome Loyalty, & Nature were only words. But my faire Princesse absolutely oppos'd it, alleadgeing that there was more hazard in a flight from Artaxata, than in a continuance in it; That if shee did remove, Regeliza must doe so too, and consequently lose all Intelligence; or by leaveing hir behinde, raise a jealousie in Crassolis sonne of the Cause, and thereby inevitably ruine what it should performe; That shee had sent already an expresse after Artabazus with the Intelligence, and an assurance that shee would, to continue it, reside where shee had learn't it, 'till either his Comands called hir from thence, or his forces render'd it a secure habitation; that if after such an enguadgement shee should flye away with me, who (all men knew) had a Passion for hir, it might raise too pregnant jealousies that hir Love, and not hir feare, was the occasion of hir remove; and that since shee knew there was, nor could be nothing intended to hir prejudice, shee had no reason to contribute to it, by hir owne actions, and to put hirselfe in danger to be safe, when shee was already so without any. I then propounded my goeing immediatly to Artemita, which was not aboue [illeg.]. Furlongs off, and with Phanasders Forces attempt to suppresse the Rebellion before it appear'd. To which my Princesse answer'd, that could I effect my proposition, what proofes could I bring of the intended Conspiracy, but Regeliza's saying it? which would be too invalidated by hir servants denyall, and be look't upon as an act of my hatred to Crassolis: But my proposition was so farre from being feacible, that Tygranes, and his Partisans, had above 4000 sellect men already in Artaxata, who would execute their designe before I could tell it Phanasder; shee therefore conjur'd me since my continuing with hir would but increase hir feares and my danger, and that my being out of Artaxata might probably contribute to the speedy reduction of it, & hir deliverance, that I would immediatly leave off all thought of the former, and embrace the latter. This sadd Command went much against my inclination, but it went more against my duty to disobey it, therefore as soone as we had form'd all our resolutions, & settl'd our Affaires and correspondency, I kist my Princesses hands, & having begg'd hit to consider of the merit of my obedience by the torment of it, that thereby I might finde my consolation in my very sufferings, I tooke my leave, & goeing out of the Pallace I mett my faithfull Philanax, to whome I made my selfe knowne, and whose joy at it, had like to have bin as prejuditiall to me as if it had bin Treachery, but findeing his error, he immediatly repair'd it, and after he had told me that Lindesia with all hir Family was remov'd to Thospia (Anexanders Government) the place too, where he had found both his sicknesse and his health) and that I had commanded him silently & with some Ivells to follow me to Artemita, without any disaster next morning by Sunnrise I arriu'd there, where the generous Governor made me a reception, in which I readd both his satisfaction, and heart. The Night following Philanax came to me, & acquainted me, that what I knew of in designe, was turn'd into action. This true Allarme made me thinke my immediate repaire to the King and Anexander requisite, and whilst I was fitting my selfe for my intended Iourny, Phanasder sent some Troopes of Horse to beate the wayes, who did too, a Party of the Revolted, leaveing 100 on the place, and presenting him with halfe as many Prisoners, from some of which, we learn'd that a Post was intercepted with a Packett for the King, and that Crassolis eldest Sonne was kill'd in a quarrell, an hower before they were come out of Artaxata; we immediatly concuded, that the former was the cause of the latter, & that Tygranes and Palisdes declin'd the formes of Iustice for the Sonns punishment, lest it might have incens't, and apper'd a Cruelty to the Father. My Equipage was no sooner form'd, than I tooke leave of Phanasder, who was extreamly pressing to have bin my Convoy, which I absolutely declin'd, since it might lose a Province, I was confident his care and presence would preserve; I besought him too, to be very vigillant for Intelligence, to communicate to me what he learn'd, and to raise what forces his power and creditt would maintaine; This Phanasder faithfully promis'd, and haveing conducted me with 500 Horse to the confines of his Government, we there parted; but because I found that to travell with all my Company would take up too-much tyme, I Commanded them to follow me by easy journies, and only takeing Philanax with me, I continu'd mine, which was indeede so long and troublesome, that the next Euening to refresh our Horses and selves, wee quitt the high way, to gaine a Wood not farre from it (for wee durst not enter into any Townes, lest they might have become our Prisons). Wee had not bin an hower in this wilde Inn, when Philanax (whose turne 'twas to watch whilst I did sleepe) came and interruped mine with the most dejected & confus'd looke that horror and amazement was capable to putt on, & told me, Alas Sir, I feare wee are for ever ruin'd, & that the Gods have forsaken virtue to take parte with vice. This sadd introduction, and his sadder Countenauce, made me start up and impatiently enquire, whether too-litle rest, & too-much travell, had not made him frantick? Ah Sir! (he reply'd with a deepe sigh) would I were, for that would appeare a lesse misfortune both to you, and me, than what has created in you that beleife: for as you were takeing your rest, a sadd voyce in a neighbouring Thicket reach't my Eares, and invited me to discover the vnfortunate vtterer of it, but I was no sooner approacht neere enough to satisfy my curiosity, than alas I found it was Artabazus, teareing his Haire, and by a thousand other extravagant cruelties, seemeing to take parte with fortune by contributing to his owne miserie. oh Gods! Philanax I repl'd) what is it that thou tells't me? That (said he) whose truth your sight may convince you of, if you will silently steale where mine receiv'd so fatall an intelligence. Come (said I Philanax) I will goe and satisfy my doubts, though I beleive the cleereing of them, wilbe a greater trouble, than they themselves are; but canst thou not (I continu'd) judge at the cause of this vnexpected change? Yes Sir (he reply'd) and I am much mistaken if it be not of a nature which wilbe as greate a greife unto you, as the effect it produces. Wee were by this tyme so neere that had he continu'd his discourse, he must have had more Auditors than one, & I had crept but a litle further, when Alas I did perceive my poore King in so sadd and dejected a Posture, and so many Teares runing from his Eyes, that the losse of my owne, had bin more tollerable, than to have had them so employ'd; I had not the patience to looke upon his sufferings, and not offer them my consolation and assistance, which riseing up to performe, the noyse I made was so neere, and so sudden, that the vnfortunate Artabazus beleiveing he was surpriz'd, covering his face with his Cloake, he cry'd out, strike, oh strike, for I am reduc'd to so much misery, that mine is vncapable of accession, but by permitting me to live, and continue in it. The Gods forbidd (I reply'd, prostrating my selfe at his Feete & embraceing his Knees) that ever I should ease my Princes afflictions by so crimminall a Cure; No (Sir) they have doubtlesse sent me hither to offer you towards that duty (but in a nobler way) my Sword, which if it proves fruitlesse, I will then employ it either to follow your Fate, than act it. These words and actions were as strange to Artabazus, as the cause that render'd them necessary was to me, and at length fancying he knew my voyce, by degrees he vnseeld his Eyes to be resolv'd, and no sooner was, than goeing back two or three stepps, he cry'd out, 'Tis Artavasdes! 'tis Artavasdes! Yes Sir (said I) 'tis he, who did not he value his Life out of a beleife that it might be serviceable to you, would blaspheame the Gods for having so long preserv'd it, to shew him his King asmuch forsaken of his Subjects, as of Fortune. I feare Artavasdes (he reply'd) I feare thou wilt repent thy kindnesse, when thou shalt learne what has reduc'd me to neede and inuite it; for know but two dayes since I not only cotemn'd thy Fathers advice in not listening to a Treaty with the perfidious Zenaxtus, but upon Hostages, sent even him into Nicopolis to conclude it, & relying on the Faith of that Traytor, against Anexanders prayers, & Intelligence, I kep't so carelesse a Guardin the Campe, that in a Night as black as his action, he surprz'd his owne Hostages, cutt thy Fathers victorious Army in peices, I feare himselfe too, and all the benefitt I receiv'd from the fidelity and courage of my Guards, was the tyme only with one of them, to flye where Fortune and the Gods did lead me, which was to this wood, where inforc't by hunger, I sent the only companion of my Misery to the next Towne, who last Night brought me some refreshment, but accompany'd with Newes, that after it, the want of releife had bin noe misfortune; for alas he told me, that Tygranes was at liberty, that he had seiz'd upon Artaxata, declar'd himselfe King, and Partizan of the Rebells, that he had imprison'd the Faithfull Crassolis, kill'd his Sonne for sending me Intelligence, and hath promis't Altezeera to Palisdes, whose Nuptialls in five dayes are to be celebrated. This morning I sent him againe for further Intelligece, and to procure some horses, both ours being dead by the violence of our travell; the faithfull Guard was already at the extreamity of the wood, when his care of my safety made him come back  & assure me, if he were not return'd at a tyme he limmited, I might conclude he was either killed, or taken, and that therefore I should remove my selfe to some other concealement; this tyme is an hower since efluxt, so that when you came to offer me your assistance for preserveing my Life, I beleiv'd it was somebody that was come to affoard me his, by easeing me of it. Though I will not (continu'd Artavasdes) give you so lowe a Carracter of my Greife, as to endeavour to describe it, yet I must tell you, that my Constancy which was firme enough not to finde vnder the burthen of my Kings, my Countryes, and my Fathers ruine, was too-weake to vndergoe the thought of Altezeera's, which had so sadd an operation on me, that my misery appeareing more transcendent than my Princes, for a while he suspended the sadd reflexions on his owne, to consider mine, but after that through pitty, or goodnesse, he had given me leave by his silence to vtter, a throng of sighes, & Complaints, he told me; Consider Artavasdes what my Greifes are, when thine have so strange an influence; those that afflict thee are thy misfortunes, those that doe me are my faults; thou hast that consolation, that the Gods have made thee miserable, I have that torment, that I made my selfe so, and consequently must consider the cause of my misfortune as great a one; as the effect. Alas Sir (I reply'd) that which you alleadge for an Argument to console me, is an aggravation of my misfortunes; for the Actions of the Gods are more just than those of Men, and they having inflicted myne, 'tis a more pregnant testimony I have merritted them, than that you have those you have drawne upon your selfe; when I consider the wayes how mine are impos'd I cannot hope they will end, since that expectation must be grounded on noe lesse an impossibility then the justice of the Gods; but the wayes in which yours are inflicted, carry their comfort with them, for had you bin guilty, you should not have bin your owne Punisher, and not being so, you cannot doubt of your releife but by injuring the highest powers asmuch as your hopes. Were there (said Artabazus) but asmuch Truth as Arte in this Argument, I might be flatter'd into a beleife that I am as innocent as miserable, but when the Gods make us become our owne executioners, 'tis so much a marke of being guilty, that then to doubt it, is to have a higher title to our punishment. Yet (I reply'd) we seldome see, that humane Iustice (which is a Coppy of the Divine) does execute a Crimminall by a Crimminall: but Sir (I continu'd) let us not contribute to our misfortunes, by so long disputing whose are the greatest, rather let us seeke out a retireing, since by what you have told me I feare this will prove noe safe one. Alas (the King answer'd) that we should flye is not more requisite than it is impossible, since for ought I see, you are as destitute of Horses as I am. No Sir (I reply'd) I have two, not farre from hence, which wee will make vse of; as for Philanax, I know he would lose, much more hazard his Life to preserve his Kings. Yes (said that faithfull Servant) 'tis my Inclination asmuch as duty & next the spending of it in your service, the best fortune it can aspire unto, is, to lose it in it. Artabazus embrac't him for his Loyalty, & gave him assurances, that if ever he return'd to his former Fortune, he would build his in so plentifull a way, that he should acknowledge he had found his Interest in his duty. Then turning to me he said, But now Artavasdes wee are fitted for our journy, whither shall wee direct it? Thospia which is the only honnest and secure retreate I can rely on, has a way to it as hazardous as continuing here. Ah Sir (I reply'd) why does your memory or your suspitions, doe the gallant Governor of Artemita and the Province belonging to it, so much wrong? you will finde, that could he rejoyce in any of your misfortunes, he would in this, which will affoard him so ample an evincement of his affection & Loyalty. 'Twas (said Artabazus) neither my Memory nor suspitions, but (I feare) my reason that made me not looke on Phanasder with the same faith that you doe; For Crassolis whose judgement in forming opinions is as great as his honesty in communicating them to me, has given me so badd & perhaps so just a carracter of him, that I should assoone put my selfe in Zenaxtus hands as his. Oh Gods! (I cry'd out) is it possible that Crassolis could so much bewitch your Reason, as to make you consider your Servants as your Enemyes, & they as your Freinds? beleive me (Sir) I will make that dissembler appeare what he is, in the worst extreame, as Phanasder will shew himselfe in the best, with whome you shall finde finde a Sanctuary as inviolable as his Faith, & for which I doe enguadge you both mine, and my life. Vpon your scoare (Artabazus reply'd) I will venter what I would not on my owne, neither would I give my retireing to Phanasder that Name, were I as confident of his Loyalty, as of his that made me suspect it. Sir said I goeing to our Horses) this is a tyme fitter to flye from a Traytor than prove one, but I wilbe content to weare that name, if I doe not evince that Crassolis does it already. Then commanding Philanax to goe meet the rest of my Servants and returne with them to Artemita (which Afterwards he did through many dangers, & then brought us word how the faithfull Governor was put to death, in torments as great as his fidelity, for not discovering to the Rebells where the King was conceal'd.) Artabazus and I by very vnfrequented wayes, and by as great diligence as good Fortune, in three dayes arriv'd there also; but never was there a more melancholly and silent Iourny, for after I had acquainted my King with all my adventures since my Imprisonment, his Greifes were so obligeing, that they gave me the liberty without interruption, of entertaining my owne; where to finde a remedy for them appear'd as difficult, as the torment which thereby I incurr'd. We had not bin an hower in Phanasders Government, when he (who was gone to beate up one of the Enemyes Quarters) return'd with successe, & presented Artabazus with the Keyes of Artemita, and with the Lives of 200 of his Enemyes. I cannot expresse with what assiduousnesse and zeale he served his Prince; you may learne them better by their effects than description, which were, that they wholly converted Artabazus suspitions into as great a confidence, and made him acknowledge he had injur'd the best of his Subjects, when he thought Phanasder was not so, who having first resign'd his owne Magnificent house to the King, receiu'd the honor of his orders, and doubl'd his Care and Guards, came to visit and acquaint me, that by a Prisoner of quality that day taken, he was assur'd, that to extinguish all difficulties betweene Zenaxtus Partizans & Tygranes, the latter had enguadg'd himselfe within two dayes to give Altezeera to Palisdes; who either to satisfy his ambition, his Passion, or his doubts, comanded all his party to keepe their houses 'till he were in possession of what might invite them with honor & safety to take the feild. I am then (I cry'd out) a Creature as farre aboue being capable of more misery, as of releife. Sir (said Phanasder) I would not have told you so fatall an Intelligence, had not my hopes of releiveing your Sorrow bin as great, as the certainty that this would create it. Alas generous freind (I reply'd) my reason cannot so much yeeld to hope, as to affoard me the latter with the former; doe not I know Altezeera is in a place as strong by numbers, as by Arte, & Nature? doe not I see my selfe voyd of Forces, & of all things tending towards hir releife, but my desires of attempting it? doe not therefore endeavour to silence my despaire, since 'tis as impossible a taske, as to remove what creats it. At least (said phanasder) let me acquaint you with what I designe, to prevent Altezeeras losse, which I know wilbe accompany'd by yours. Yes, yes, Phanasder, (I reply'd) I invoke the Gods to punish me with a higher affliction (were it possible) than the loseing that faire Princesse, if, in the same minute I heare shee is in Palisdes Armes, I doe not cast my selfe into those of Death. That (said Phanasder) which I have to propound, is of a quality, that you may dye acting your revenge if you cannot reach your hopes, & be certayne not to survive your felicity when you have lost it. Ah Freind (said I embraceing him) this is something worthy Phanasder, and my attention, I beleive (said he) when I have told it you, you will esteeme it too, worthy your hopes: This Night (he continu'd) I shall have here a Thousand select Horse, & as Many Foote, drawne out of the generall Garrisons of this Province; I can take from Artemita 500 Horse and as many Foote without endangering the place, or Artabazus safety; these numbers being too-few to storme Artaxata, wee must supply their want with Arte, to effect which, tomorrow Night (which is the Eue of the intended Nuptialls) wee will martch dureing the obscurity, by vnfrequented wayes to Artaxata, and vnder some Ruines & Bankes of Arraxis, we may conveniently lodge a greater body than ours; at the first opening of the Gates, I will send in at severall Portes (to avoyde suspition) 200 of the valiantest and youngest Souldiers in Womens Cloathes, but with weapons vnder their Gownes, who passing for villagers come to see the solemnity's, may by degrees draw towards the Gate next to us, seize upon it and give us entrance, which if once we have, we deserve to lose our hopes if we doe not convert them into certainties. I was infinitly satisfy'd with so probable a way of releiveing my Princesse, and so certaine a way of Death if that fail'd. But whilst we were making and answering all objections in our designe, an Officer came and advertis'd his Governor, that all those Forces he had sent for were neere the Citty, and expected his Commands; This joyfull intelligence separated us, he to dispose of those Troopes, and I to acquaint Artabazus how we intended to employ them. I found him somewhat startl'd at the greatnesse of the hazard and attempt, but when I had told him that our disease was too desperate to refuse any Cure; that as wee had lost our selves by a deepe security, so we must endeavour our restauration by as high a boldnesse; that wee could but lose 3000. Men, and that we might recover halfe a Kingdome, which at least follow'd the Fate of Artaxata, Tygranes,  & Palisdes, he at last gave us his leave, and his prayers. The next Night all things being (by Phanasders care) in an exact readinesse, we began our Martch, & by continuing it without any intermission or encounter, an hower before day wee came and lodg'd our selues behinde those Bankes and Ruines, and haveing sent our young Villagers scattering to the severall Portes, they were no sooner open'd than without any examination or suspition, they all enter'd, & about halfe an hower after, by a successefull resolution, cutt off as great a number as their owne, which compos'd the Guard of the East Gate, and haveing given the agree'd-on-signall, Phanasder with 500 Horse, rann with full speede to the assistance of his Amazon's, who for all his expedition, were before he joyn'd them, deceas'd above 50. l cannot expresse with what ravishment I follow'd with all the rest of our little Army, nor with what Fury wee trampl'd over all those that oppos'd our passage to the Temple, whither, I was told (by a Prisoner) Tygranes (immediatly before the Allarme) had lead the Princesse Altezeera, who I was greedily ambitious to relieve, lest I might lose the invitation and reward of my attempt. I therefore begg'd Phanasder to pardon the impatiency of a Lover; and to oppose our Enemyes whilst I was goeing to releive our Freinds. That generous Man conjur'd me to make haste, lest he might misse of victory by missing me; I had not leasure to answer so flattering a coplement, for I went directly with 500 Gentlemen, to the dwelling of the Gods, where I was necessitated to Sacrifice vnto them neere 1000. Souldiers that opps'd my entry, and where the reward of that victory was great, though the victory it selfe were not, for by it I possest the faire Altezeera, who I found abandon'd by Tygranes, and hit design'd husband, & with whome I left all those to secure hir liberty, who had obtain'd it, being hastily called away to assist Phanasder, whome I joyn'd in the great Feild before the Royall Pallace, ready to receive the charge of 3000 Horse and Foote lead by Tygranes  & Palisdes. I will passe over the accidents in this litle Battell, to tell you the event of it, which was an entire victory on the justest side, and which shew'd that Fortune had no hand in it: Palisdes found his Fate on that sword on which his Father & Brother had found theirs, but the Prince Tygranes by flight avoyded his, though in this action he manifested so much courage, that had his duty bin as great, he had not given testimonyes of it in a way which chang'd that virtue into a Crime. With the winning this litle Battell we wonne Artaxata, which I left to his care that had conquer'd it, and went to my Princesse, who receiu'd me with such passionat prayses, that I found in them a higher reward, than in having bin successefull; but observing that hir joy or hir ignorance made hir attribute the entire glory to him that had but the least share in it, I let hir know, that 'twas not only Phanasder that had acted hir release, but design'd it too; that for my particuler, my greife for hir Captivity had bin so large that I could doe nothing but deplore it, and that it had not bin so transcendent as to have made me decline the thought of hir releife, had not the thought of the impossibility of it render'd it so. Whatsoever you tell me (said Altezeera) I will call you my Restorer, and I beleive Phanasder will neither envy nor deny you that title; but beleive me (shee continu'd) though you had not Releiv'd Altezeera, your Ryvall had not possest hir, but my evasion only was a trouble to me, because the way which couduc'd to my not being Palisdes's, had render'd me eternally vncapable of being Artavasdes's. Therevpon shee shew'd me a glittering Steele, which I can truely say struck me with more feare than all of the same mettall I had seene that day in my Enemyes hands, which my Princesse observeing, shee told me, what Autavasdes! does a demonstration of my Affection fright you? and had you rather I should be vnconstant, than dead? Yes Madam (I reply'd) for I had rather dye, than you should. But (said Altezeera) had you rather have me live in vice than dye in Innocencie? when too that vice, would render me as vnworthy, as vndesirous to Live? Ah Madam (I reply'd) let us, (I beseech you) breake off this discourse, lest perhapps the evincement how much I Love you might induce you to suspect I doe not. You may (said Altezeera, smileing) impose what lawes you please where you have made your conquest, which I will obey, lest you might thinke it not so entire as it is. Wee had in the Temple some discourses of this nature, which at length were interrupted by the generous Phanasder, who came to kisse the Princesse hand, & to tell hir, that now shee had no more Enemyes in Artaxata than those which had lost their Lives for having bin so. Have you then (said I to Phanasder, after Altezeera had receiv'd him with a respect worthy his Services and virtue) given Crassolis the reward of his infidelity? No Sir (he answer'd) Crassolis shalbe (if you please) reseru'd for Artabazus Sentence, which pronounc't from that Mouth, wilbe more regular, & perhapps more sensible: wee are too much his Enemyes to be his Iudges: But (he continu'd) when I spoake of the Princesses's Enemyes, I only intended those in Armes. I beleive (said I) though Crassolis does more meritt the Name of Enemy, than any that have bin in Armes; yet wee shall finde it a more difficult taske to make the King thinke him his, than wee had this day to conquer all ours. If he does not (Phanasder answer'd) he will finde his punishment in his fault, but were I of your faith, I would immediatly be just to Artabazus & Crassolis, by having the latter executed. No Phanasder (I reply'd) I beseech you leave off that thought, for if wee impos'd his Death, we might bring his guilt to be doubted, by the way in which it is punish'd. I tell you this (said Artavasdes) the more particularly, that you might see how neere I was to have avoyded all my future miseries, & how I my selfe contributed to the preservation of him, which caus'd them; For this Inchaunter Crassolis, made himselfe appeare as innocent to Artabazus, as he did faulty to us, nay the losse of that life which discover'd his Treason, he made a successefull argument of his Innocency, and thereby obtain'd a power, whose effects I shall eternally deplore with asmuch cause as violence: but whether (continu'd Artavasdes, interrupting himselfe) does the reflection on that Traytor transport me? I must begg your pardon for a fault, which I beleive you will excuse when you know the Cause, & the sooner to acquaint you with it, I will returne to the faire Altezeera, who I left in the Temple, and who merritted one with more reason (perhapps) than the Deity to whome that was consecrated. Shee too was so Mercifull to Crassolis, as to thinke it lust to have his King only his judge. Hir opinio was our resolution, which we had no sooner elected, than we return'd to the Pallace, and meeting by the way Palisdes Body carrying to the Grave, it had the noble solemnity of Altezeeras Teares, which affoarded him a felicity in Death, better than his Life had merrited; but it may be shee shedd those for his Crimes, and not his fall. Phanasder and I having waited on Altezeera to hir Appartment, withdrew our selves to make our dispatches to the King, who in few dayes came to his old residence & new Conquest, where he receiv'd Crassolis into his former favour, who made use of it according his former practice. You doe perhapps, thinke it strange, that I found Altezeera so early in the Temple, but I beleive you will no longer, when I acquaint you, 'tis the Armenian Custome for the Bride to employ halfe the day of the Nuptialls in Prayers & divine solemnities, to render the Gods Propitious to the Marriage. Hir first thus happily prevented, I was a thousand tymes ready to implore hir permission to begg hir of hir Brother, & when I had even supprest my feares, and taken up a resolution for so transcedent a request; I was diverted from it, by the certaine Intelligence that Zenaxtus with an Army of 60000 Men, was martching towards Artaxata, to recover or lose himselfe before it, and that the Prince Tygranes was gone to Pompey the Great (the Successor to Lucullus Army and Fortune) and by his prayers and assurances of a considerable party's joyneing with him, induced that great Captaine for a tyme to suspend his prosecuting Mithridates, to invade Armenia, towards which the Roman Eagles were flying with great celerity. Artabazus in this great exigency gave me the Comand of all the Armenian Militia, & opening the publique Treasures left them to my dispose, with which I immediatly leavy'd an Army to oppose Zenaxtus, great enough to raise my hopes of releiveing Anexander (if liveing) or of revenging him (if dead.) I gave the gallant Phanasder Commission and mony to leavy another, to secure and defend the Passes on the Bankes of Araxis, where then Pompey was campt, 'till I had decided the dispute with Zenaxus, who was the neerest and the most pressing Enemy. To be breife Phanasder, who raign'd more in Artabazus Subjects, than he himselfe did over them, so suddenly form'd his Forces, that before I thought he had sent his inferiour Officers to have rais'd them, I learn'd they were all ready, & possest of the Armenian Frontiers. For my particuler, with 6000 Horse, and 24000 Foote I advanc't to meete the Enemy, he relying on his numbers, & I on my quarrell, and the virtue of those that fought in it, we soone came to a battell, which lasted 'till Night did the office of Trumpetts, & sounded a retreate. The advantages and the animosities of both Armyes were so resembling, that wee soone found what call'd the Souldiers to rest, was esteem'd by them an injury, which the next morning was againe evinc't, for they could no sooner see their Enemyes, than they went to destroy them, & though wee omitted nothing of either side which might end the dispute before the day did, yet I beleive this had bin the perfect coppy of the precedent, if an accident, as strange as the Battell, had not put a period to it. The scene of this long Tragedy was at the Foote of a great Hill, which in our hottest dispute wee sawe cover'd with a great Cloude of Cavalry, that so terrified both Armyes (not knowing to which of them the releife was intended) that whatever Zenaxtus and I could doe, all our Souldiers at first suspended their swords as their thoughts, then sheath'd them, & by degrees return'd vnder their Ensignes, thinking all dispute against so powerfull a supply, as vaine as dangerous. I was enrag'd to finde that the Faith of my Army, for I was confident those Forces came to ravish not contribute to my victory, And in that beleife I prest my Army to returne to the Charge, that if they were freinds, they might see and have no share in our successe, and if not, to fight them before they were joyn'd. But all my perswasions being fruitlesse, I was taking some resolutio of an honorable death alone, since I was deny'd it in Company, but those designes instantly vanisht, & gave place to joyes as pleaseing, by those new Troopes falling like a storme on Zenaxtus Army, who by it, having lost their hopes, soone after did their Courages & Lives. My Army contributing nothing to the Conquerors Glory, but the not particpating in it. Zenaxtus death accompany'd by 40000 of his companions, was the end and expiation of their Rebellion, all the rest having bin kill'd the precedent day, and taken in this. After the Execution was ended, I ridd up & downe the feild to learne from whome Armenia & Artavasdes had receiv'd so signall an obligation, But I soone found the sight of my Preserver, was a greater blessing then the preservation it selfe, For 'twas the generous Annexander; I flung my selfe instantly at his Feete, acknowledg'd him twice my Father, in giveing me my life, & in preserveing it, and by a million of other demonstrations, endeavour'd to manifest a contentment as great extetiourly, as it was in my heart. That generous Princes extacies were not inferiour to mine, which being somewhat lessen'd, to satisfy my impatient longing, in knowing from what kind God he deriv'd his deliverance he told me, After I was fallen into Zenaxtus hands, by his Treachery to Artabazus, which might as easily have bin prevented by the King, as it was foreseene by me, The perfidious Traytor had immediatly executed me, but that he thought a death without lingering, rather a Mercy than a Revenge, therefore I was kept alive, 'till some torment as great as his Cruelty, or as he meritted, was found out, which being at length, I was carryed out of a Prison that I beleive could not be an inferior one to that he design'd me, & as the Tormentors were begining their office (my Iudge being one of the Spectators of his Sentence) a Post arriv'd, who presented him a packett, which, (as I after learn'd) brought the news of your successe against Artaxata, the death of Palisdes, the flight of Tygranes, and your being made Generallissimo of all Armenia, this which in all probability should have increast his fury, suspended the execution of it, and return'd me to a lesse troublesome Prison, but though he gave out that he preserv'd me only to make you (who he was then goeing against) participate in my sufferings, by imposeing them in your sight, yet I rather beleive my reprive proceded from his apprehension of a turne in Fortune, and that his would be desperate if yours were successfull, did he extinguish his fury in my blood: whatever was the cause I cannot determine, yet he carry'd me Prisoner in his Army, but as the Gods ordain'd it, Zenaxtus committed the care of my restraint, to a Gentleman who was engag'd in his Cause, more by his relation to those in it, than his approbation of it. This generous Keeper, the first Night of our Martch allow'd me halfe his Bedd, & takeing the opportunity of our being without Auditors, by a handsome discourse, assur'd me of his pitty for my miseries, & of his intentions to releive them, that my patience in enduring my torments was of a quality that convinc't him it proceeded not from my Fortitude, but my Innocence, & concluded that he was thereby invited to be of a cause, which gave the defenders of it power to conquer their Enemyes by their very sufferings. This proceeding was so free, and so like a Gentleman, that to have doubted it, had bin a Crime, as great as his virtue, I therefore gave him assurance of my beleiving his professions, and that if he would decline Zenaxtus for Artabazus, he should thereby better his Fortunes asmuch as his Cause. Sir (said he) I will take up Armes to evince that the Quarrell I approve I will defend, but I will accept of noe Command but an inferiour one to what I have here, lest those that are Enemyes to Truth, and to me, should alleage my Interest was my conversion. In breife (said Annexander) the next Night, he so judiciously order'd our escape, that leaving nothing to Fortune he left us nothing to feare, so that without any encounter or interruption, we reacht in three dayes to Thospia, from whence my deliverer sent Zenaxtus the cause of his being there, & where, by Lindesia's power and care I found that body of Horse ready for service, with which I martcht after Zenaxtus, but could not overtake his Army, 'till you had so weaken'd and harrast it, that I came rather to act an execution than a Fight, & insteed of helping Artavasdes to a victory, I have rob'd him of one. This flattery was so palpable, that I did not esteeme it fitt by a reply to evince it one, but begg'd him by his permission, to have the Honor to be known to his generous Preserver, He meritts it (said my Father) for I have seene him this day, doe more against Zenaxtus, than when he gave Anexander his liberty; we went thereupon towards those new and victorious Troopes to finde him, but alas wee found him too-soone, for before we had gone halfe the way, Anexander perceiv'd him pale and cold amongst the dead; oh Gods! what did not my poore Father at the sight of that fatall object? But let us passe over those gratefull extravagancies, though they abundantly manifested how pretious to him the Life was, whose death was so passionatly deplor'd. The next morning after our victory, by a generall Muster we learn't what it cost us, which was 10000 Men lost, & as many vnserviceable for the present; with this Army wer return'd to Artaxata, whose litlenesse made some beleive wee had mist of successe, & others, that we had deerly bought & deseru'd it. Artabazus (when my Father kist his hand) protested he had brought him two things he most ambitiously desir'd, Victory, & Annexander, that he was asmuch oblig'd to him for the latter as the former, and if he were capable of any greife whilst he lookt upon him, it proceeded from a reflection of what his credulity had so much hazarded, and for his having neglected an advice where the punishment of it could not have bin greater than the fault. My reception was much resembling my Fathers, so were my acknowledgements, which finisht, I presented the King my Commission, which Annexanders liberty made my Iustice and my duty to restore. But (said Artavasdes) why doe I amuze my selfe to give you my Story by retaile? tis enough you know I kept my Commission, because my King would not receive, nor my Father accept it, and by that retension I found the duty of it, and my promise oblig'd me to joyne with Phanasder, whose Courage all this while had kept the Romans from possessing what they dayly sawe, there being only the Ryver Araxis betwixt both Armyes. But to abuse your patience as litle as I can without disobedience, I will omitt my Princesse's joyes at my late returne and successe, and hir contrary Passions for my then separation, which too appeare the more vnfortunate, since the cause of it was to oppose the Conquerors of the World (for that Title the Romans gave themselves and their performances did almost confirme) with Forces too that were so diminisht by a former successe; that they could hardly expect any in the future: But what consol'd me in this expedition was, if I were successefull, my Ioyes would be no longer protracted, and if I were not; I resolv'd my life should not, 'Twas with these thoughts & resolutions I advanced towards Phanasder, whose Numbers I found asmuch diminisht by sicknesse as they could have bin by a defeate, so that the conjunction of both our Forces did not compose as great a Body as mine did before Zenaxtus's defeate, or his before the mortallity, but that which cau'd our admiration was, that though Pompey knew our weaknesse yet he made no advantage of it by any attempts, but alas! our admiration was cur'd by our Greife, for not many dayes after, Artabazus (with a small Traine) came to the Campe and told me, that all the higher Armenia was in a generall flame which he had sent my Father to quench, with Forces risen in haste, and that his intelligence of Artaxata's intended revolt upon the least misfortune, had made him esteeme my weake Army a securer Sanctuary than that Citty. on Gods! Sir (I hastily cry'd out) if Artaxata be no Sanctuary for Artabazus, how could he esteeme it one for Altezeera? I have (said Artabazus) neither esteem'd it one for Altezeera, neither left hir there, shee is gone to Thospia with Anexander, who, were he not concearn'd in hir safety for his Kings sake, I beleive he would be for his Sonnes. Those words made me blush, and the former made me know that Pompey had lay'n quiet 'till this new Combustion might (by a diversion) facilitate his entry. That same day therefore (because wee howerly expected the Romans advance) a Coucell was call'd, in which, Crassolis (who attended the King) assisted, His opinion was to determine all by Battell not by Treaty, since the latter could not possibly cement the fractions but by the Kings yeelding much to the Prince, which consessions would be a dangerous president: would be tearmed by the Armenians a Submission, and would invite Tygranes unto future Revolts by the first prooving so successefull, who, being too, reflected on as a Successor to the Crowne, the multitude (which commonly consider their owne benefit and not the right) might in the future incline to him, who according to the course of Nature was probably longest able to reward or punish them, That a victory against the Romans, would be one too against the Rebells, who never had taken up Armes had not they thought those of the Romans would have exempted them from making any use of their owne, that the cause of the revolt being taken away, the effect of consequence would follow, & if the Gods had decree'd our Ruine; 'twas more like Armenians to fall by the Sword than by Submission, without which he durst (as he said) lose his life if ever Pompey would treate: This advice Phanasder & I oppos'd, not only because 'twas his (& consequently we might thinke it the worst) but because too it was really so, and esteem'd so generally by all the Councell, who concurr'd in my Reasons, which were, That if the revolted follow'd the fortune of the Romans, by having an externall Peace, we should have an internall one also; That all the Faithfull Armenian Militia were almost distroyed by Civill and Forraigne Warres, by successes, and by mortallitys; That not only the Rebells within, but the Romans, and Parthians without, were all pulling on hir Fate; That shee had never more Enemyes and lesse Power to resist them; That nothing but a Peace could avoyde the former and restore the latter; That it was better to yeeld something than lose all; That Tyme might procure a returne of those consessions, or enable us to re-take them; That by a present Peace we should (if there were in the future an occasion of warre) make it, when the Romans (Tygranes greatest helpe) would not be in a readinesse to afford him any; That by making a Peace, Artabazus would make Tygranes his Subject, but by a Warre he would make him his equall, and perhapps his Superior; That thereby the Roman and Parthian Armes which were ready to invade Armenia, would leave hir in a quiet security by being employ'd one against another; & that if a Peace were refus'd after an offer of reasonable tearmes, wee had thereby made the Gods our Freinds, and invited them to punish an Enemy who was guided by the rule of Power, and not of Iustice. I know not whether Artabazus feare or Iudgement made him decline Crassolis advice to follow the Councells, but I know, the next morning he sent a Herhault to Pompey to offer a Parly, which he absolutly declin'd without Artabazus would submitt himselfe as conquer'd, & to his Mercy yeeld that Parte of Armenia on the East of Euphrates to Tygranes, and pay a yearly homage for the residue to the Roman Empire. Though my Resentment at so barbarous a Message were great, yet it could not transcend my Kings Feares, who vallueing Pompeys Power by his Insolency, in apprehension of the former, told me, there was no way but to submitt unto the latter. Never, never Sir (I cry'd out) shall Artabazus whilst I weare a Sword, vn-King himselfe: let the Gods doe it if that misfortune be writt in the Booke of Fate; and though I esteem'd it fitt to treate with the Romans because their Army was the greater, yet now I am absolutly against it, their vnjust and insolent demands having at lest equall'd our Forces; 'Tis more glorious to dye at the head of 2000 Gentlemen, than to live with the Title of a King without the Power, and to let our succeeding Story's register, that Artabazus was the first that dismember'd his Kingdome, & the only man that was conquer'd in it. The King esteem'd what I said to be fitter for his commendation than his practice, and the false Crassolis perceiving the Father was ready to give asmuch by Feare as the Sonne could winn by Battell, upon the second sitting of the Councell (which was to fixe upon a positive answer for Pompey) he was as absolutely for a Treaty, as at the first he had bin for a Warre, & so proportion'd his reasons to his Princes apprehensions, that he determin'd to put himselfe into the Roman Mercy, when the Presidents of some Kings of the Gaules and of the Affricans demonstrated they had none. Phanasder and I at this resolution begg'd Artabazus permission for our selves & Annexander to retire unto our Governments, that by seemingly becoming Rebells to his Authority, wee might preserve some Forces to maintaine and raise it in the future; but our request concerning our selves, found a resembling returne to that we had made for our King, and 'twas no wonder he declin'd his Freinds advantage, when he had already his owne; But as the Assembly was upon the point of riseing, a Trumpett from the Roman Campe came into ours, & sent me (in) a Letter from the Leivtenant Generall of that Army, I was surpriz'd at the Newes of that Name, for I knew Pompey had bin without one since the death of Sillanus, but opening & reading what was sent me, I found the contents of it was, to desire a single meeting with me that day & that the Desirer of it was the generous Ventidius (a Patritian of Rome) with whome (during my residence there & in Lucullus Army) I had contracted an intimate & passionate Freindship: I cannot tell you my joy to learne I had no small power with one Roman that had so much with all the rest; I immediatly communicated this to Artabazus, begg'd his permission to waite upon my Freind, and that he would not permitt any of the Councell to be out of his sight 'till my returne, lest the discovery of his intended submission might hinder my preventing it. The King having promis'd my desire, I dispatch't the Trumpet to Ventidius, and immediatly follow'd him my selfe to a place assign'd upon the Bankes of Araxis, where I found my generous Freind was already come, out of a confidence I would not faile his Commands, which, (after a world of embraces and new reitterations of an auncient Freindship) I desir'd to learne that I might obey them. I would not (said Ventidius) having given you this trouble but to serve you, and to evince our former confidence of one another is not diminisht, or impair'd by absence or tyme, or by our now being of different Party's. I will acquaint you with that which shall aboundantly performe it: Know then, that but two dayes since I came to Pompey's Army to be his Leiutenant-Generall, which title I derive from the favour of Iulius C aesar, who if my affection deceive me not, you will see as famous for his power, as he is already for his Courage and Virtue; & though now he has the command of all Gaule, (one of the greatest & noblest Provinces in the World) & though against that Warlike Nation he has wonne more Victories than ever Alexander did against the effeminate Persians, yet I have seene him at the reading of that Grecians Life, weepe that his owne has not bin so victorious and active, when indeede, if he ought to have shedd any Teares, they should have bin rather of joy than a contrary passion for Alexanders having bin his foyle & not his Patterne; by this you may fancy what Caesar is like to aspire unto, when though already he has attain'd vnto such a height of Glory, he yet esteemes himselfe scarce ascending; and lest Pompey (who he only thinkes worthy the name of his Ryvall) should prove a successefull one, Caesar has sent me to the second Command of this Army, which he knowes I have some interest in, it being compos'd (for the greater parte) of Lucullus's. But Pompey's Freinds who judge nothing but the Roman Empire can satisfy a Minde as large, have sent Domitius to him to let him know, that 'tis more for the Interest of Rome to make the Armenians their Freinds than their Subjects, that they apprehend Caesars Ambition, Power and Fortune, will make them stand in need of more than Roman Armes to maintaine the Roman liberty; That besides those feares, they have contracted as great and as just ones from the virtue & successe of a Slave, which if the progresse of his actions prove as fortunate as the begining, will soone make Italy the Scene of two contrary extreames; That therefore he should with all diligence disingage himselfe from those Easterne Warres, lest whilst he is increasing the Empire of Rome, another possesse it. This (continu'd Ventidius) I had from Domitius, who has bin my Companion in my journy, and who esteeming me more a Freind to Rome than to Caesar, trusted me with this Intelligence, which Pompey so absolutly beleives, that I being inform'd 'twas Artavasdes which commanded the Armenian Army and the badd posture it was in) I tooke occasion this morning to let my Generall knowe, that now the opportunity was offer'd of obligeing all Armenia to him, that his Power might make them feare, but his Mercy love him, That by countenancing so vnnaturall a Sonne against his Father, the successe of the action would be blemisht by the Cause; That he which would be an Enemy to him that gave him Life, could hardly be a Freind to one which gave him a Kingdome, since the power which could conferre such a Guilt, will (by the knowledge of his owne want of meritt) keepe him in perpetuall feares and jealousies that it will re-assume it; That his carriage to his Father evinces, that those which most oblige him ought most to apprehend him, & that the Generall of Armenia was so perticularly knowne to me and my Freind, that I durst inguage my selfe asmuch for his Gratitude if he were oblig'd, as for his induring all the Miseries in the world rather than incline to any conditions which might looke like a submission. To which Pompey (who has set up his rest to winne me) reply'd, I shalbe rather induc'd to graunt Armenia what you desire because their Generall is your Freind, than out of a beleife thereby to make that Kingdome a Freind to me; Therefore Ventidius, upon your owne scoare I gave you a Power (to conclude with them) as large as the Senate has given me, I have too but evennow receiu'd an assurance which makes me thinke Tygranes fitt for my Revenge (were he worthy of it) For a Packett that he sent Zenaxtus before his defeate & Death, came by a strange accident into my hands, which (vncypher'd) discovers, his Intention was to keepe me here to divert and distract Artabazus Forces 'till Zenaxtus had subdu'd them, and then to permitt me no share in Armenia but what I could purchase by my Sword; and though what I now tell you may seeme to lessen my obligation, yet if you consider it rightly, it will raise the value of it, For if Tygranes had continu'd in Innocency, I must have rewarded it with my Conquests, but his guilt will give the Romans what I shall winne with their Armes. I will (continu'd Artavasdes) exempt you from the repetition of our discourses, to acquaint you with their conclusion, which was, that Artabazus the next day should visit Pompey, that he should pardon his Sonne as Pompey would because he was so, and that he should give the Roman Army 6000 Talents as a largesse. That Pompey, on the other side, should salute him by the name of King of Armenia, Freind and Allye to the Roman Empire, that he should demand none of the Armenian Territories, but should restore him to the litle Kingdome of Sophena which the Romans had formerly taken from his Crowne. After this result the generous Ventidius return'd to the Roman Campe, and I to the Armenian, where I learn'd the King was still in Councell, whither I went, and where as soone as I came, Artabazus with a timerous action came towards, and askt me, well Artavasdes, what must I expect? has Pompey rais'd his conditions because I was so long a graunting them? No Sir (I reply'd) you are so farre from parting with a share of your Kingdome, that by the generosity of Ventidius, I have gotten you another; Thereupon I told him all wee had concluded on, But the poore Prince was so incredulous, that even for a tyme his good Fortune afflicted him asmuch as his ill, but when by many protestations I had remov'd all his doubts, he rann to embrace me, and was in such transports, that had we bin ignorant what his feares had bin we might have read them in his joyes, Never so many Titles of gratitude were given to all Men as Artabazus gave me, the Names of his Deliverer, Restorer and Guardian Angell, were the lowest of his irregularities. The next morning wee put all things in a Posture to conduct him to the Roman Army, but truly we found ours so thinn by the mortality,  & by the absence of those which fledd from it; that we could hardly forme a Guard fitt for a King and leave one fitt for a Campe. As soone as we came to the Trench of the Romans, Two Lictors with Axes and Rodds, came & advertis'd Artabazus he must light, for never any Man ridd in a Roman Campe; he obey'd this advertisement, and to repaire his having offer'd an offence (which his ignorance of their Discipline render'd none) as soone as he sawe Ventidius who attended him within the Gates, he presented him with his Sword, which Ventidius declin'd with much humility, and pointing at me told him, you owe (Sir) both it & your Crowne to that Man. I was so asham'd at this submission, that I heard not then my Freinds complement, who conducted Artabazus to Pompey who came with much Civility to salute him; but because my Princes submissions were belowe his quality, I will paste them bye as vnfitt for my repetition, & tell you, that all which Ventidius and I had concluded, was ratify'd by Pompey to Artabazus, only the Roman Generall placeing the Father on the right hand and the Sonne on the left, desir'd the former to give the latter for his maintenance the Kingdome of Sophena, which too he said he ask't, only to convince Tygranes that they had both pardon'd him. This Artabazus willingly graunted, and besides the 6000 Talents, gave the Roman Souldiers and Officers so great an additionall gratuity, that they found from his bounty more than they could have expected from their Swords. Pompey too, for Ventidius sake, plac't on me many Civities, of a nature as generous as his owne. But Artabazus had no sooner past the Ryver Artaxis than Pompey sent for Tygranes to let him know, before their parting, how great his faults had bin, & the Mercyes which had pardon'd them, and to infuse into him some principles, which might in the future have made him acknowledge he had more oblig'd him by his advice than he could have done by his Sword. But that vnfortunate Prince finding his designes reveal'd, and his hopes ruin'd, was so incens'd against Pompey (who he consider'd as the Author of both) that he told his Messenger, he would not come into a Mans Company who for feare, or for 6000 Talents, had sold his Ghest and his Faith. Pompey enrag'd at so sharpe & so strange a Reply, made him a Prisoner; This accession of misfortune made Tygranes vtter some words that induc'd the Roman Generall to send him in that quality to Rome, there to be kept 'till his arrivall, to be lead in tryumph. Artabazus was soone advertis'd of this proceeding, with the impossibility of having it alter'd, in which he found, that Tygranes want of duty which hitherto had bin his trouble, was now his consolation, for my perticular, I was so sensible of the Princes sufferings, though in them I read the justice of them; that I became both to Pompey and Ventidius an earnest (though a fruitlesse) Solicitor. But whilst the Armenians  & Romans were celebrating their new Freindship on the Bankes of Artaxis, there came advice both to Artabazus and Pompey that Arsaces was already in person on those of Euphrates, with a vast Army, and had invaded the Roman Collonyes in Syria by his youngest Sonne Phraates. Pompey at this Allarme, by a personall visit, invites my King to joyne with the Roman Empire in a League offensive and Defensive against the Parthians, and to conclude and ratify the conditions of it, that he would send a solemne Embassy to the Senate. Artabazus joyfully embrac'd this overture, to revenge his Affront (at the Battell of Miramines) & to be vnited to a Power, to which the World submitted; for my parte, all the reluctancy I had, proceeded from being thereby invol'd in a Warre against my Preserver, and Restorer; But a publique duty yeelding to a perticuler, I submitted to this league, with resolution aswell for gratitude as safety, to avode the generous Artabbanes Sword, and to employ my owne as litle as I could (with loyalty) in a Quarrell he thought worthy to act in, and defend. (Artabbanes only by a smile tooke notice of his Freinds flattery, who thus continu'd his discourse,) Whilst the Roman Generall was with Artabazus, there came an expresse from Annexander to acquaint him, that by the assistance of Evaxes, & Falintus, he had defeated one of the Rebells Armyes in the higher Armenia, and that the other, learning their Companions Misfortunes, & his new contracted Freindship with the Romans, were come without Armes, and had submitted to his Mercy, which he besought Artabazus might so act, as his Subjects might finde more safety (aswell as honesty) in returning to their allegiance, than in casting it off. This request, in the joy of the successe (and the necessity of Subjects hearts rather than destructions) found a ready graunt; And than the intended Embassy might have the greater appearance, Annexander was elected for the Embassador, his victoryes dispenceing with his absence, & rendring his presence the more considerable at Rome; and though the League was but in agitation, yet Pompey before his Martch into Syria, to convince Artabazus how confident he was of its conclusion at Rome, and perhapps to manifest how litle he apprehended Phraates, he left Affranius in Armenia, with command, to vnite his legion with my Army against Arfaces, for I was immediatly sent with all the Forces already rais'd, to oppose his invasion. I cannot tell you how infinitly I repyn'd at Fortune for creating new Warres upon conclusion of the old, and for raiseing almost as many difficulties against the satisfaction of my Flame, as in the object that gave it a being, there were Beauties and perfections. Annexander upon the Kings commands, left that Army, whose Swords had conquer'd one, and whose Fame had another, and was no sooner at Artaxata, than he was sent from thence to Rome with Pompey's Letter to the Senate. His Equipage in that employment was so magnificent, that many who judg'd of the Kings State by the Subjects, concluded Armenia had bin a Country fitter for the Conquest than Freindship of Rome, if the danger had not appear'd as great as the recompence. My Father having begun his journy, I advanc't towards Arsaces with Afranius, in whose litle Campe I sawe a patterne of Discipline and obedience, which made me no longer wonder at their successe. I had that consolation too, that my way lay by Thospia, and that my Princesse did my Army the honor of seeing it, where- whereby (but goeing to a Battell) they receiv'd a nobler reward (except the repetition of the same) than they could have injoyed after a victory. This propheticall recompence rais'd both the Generall & his Souldiers resolutions to act in gratitude what they should out of hope, and that which gave us no small one of obtaining a victory, was the advertisement one of my Spyes brought me, that Artabbanes was not in the Parthian Army. But the Euphrates being betweene that and the Armenian, for above three Moones wee only past the tyme in skirmishes, wherein our successes were so good, that perhaps they could not more enflame our desires to decide all by a Battell, than they made Arsaces apprehensive of comeing to that Tryall, who was not long after sent for by the Prince Phraates, being hottly Allarm'd by the approach of Pompey. Orodes esteeming his youngest Sonnes feares to be just, and thinking there was more honor to be wonne from Pompey than Artavasdes, left his eldest Sonne the Prince Pacorus Generall of that Army against which I lay encamp't, and with other forces went to releive Phraates and oppose the Romans. And though Pacorus, three dayes after his Fathers departure invited me to a Battell, which next to victory was the best happinesse I could desire in that Warre, yet I had no small reluctancy to employ my life against a Prince from whome I had receiv'd it; but the Tyes of Loyalty to my King, & of duty to his Commands, made me returne him word I would obey them, which too, was accompany'd with a passionate & trve vowe, that I had rather have drawne my Sword against my selfe, than him: That I could not expect his pardon did I not know, he did, the obligations which Subjects have to their Kings, and that all my consolation was, if conquer'd, I should increase his Glory, & if Conqueror, I should so employ my Fortune, as thereby evince I was so long vngratfull but only because I could not be otherwise. The next morning I drew my Army off the Bankes of Euphrates, to give Pacorus liberty without interruption to passe over that Bridge of Boates he had made; and no sooner were the Parthians & Armenians ready to begin the Battell, than I made a Proclamation upon paine of Death none of mine should act Pacorus's, but that they should take as many Prisoners as they could without indangering the generall safety, and then the signall being given, wee began the charge; But the Parthian Army wanting Artabbanes, wanted Victory, which the Armenians purchas'd at a bloody rate, Twice that day Pacorus singl'd me out, and twice that day I fledd the Encounter after I knew against whome I fought, though in our first meeting my ignorance made me spill some blood, which when I knew from whome I drew it, I wisht it had bin my owne. One hundred & five Ensignes, 6000 Comon Souldiers, and 300 Officers (in which Number Surena, Labienus and Vixores were) remain'd in our hands as arguments of our Successe, all which the next moning I sent to Pacorus with a Letter, which begg'd him to beleive the way in which I manifested my gratitude was as great a trouble to me, as it could be to him. Two dayes after I caus'd all the Parthian & Armenian Bodyes in one funerall Fire to be burnt, and the next Night Pacorus haveing done the same with his bridge, martcht away, and left me the liberty of returning to the faire Altezeera (a happinesse greater than the glory of the successe) with whome I found Artabazus, whose pardon I implor'd for having dispos'd of the effects of our victory without his knowledge, and to his Enemyes. But he seem'd to be angry at the request, not that I had offended him, but that I thought so. As soone as the importunate Ceremonyes of my Tryumph were ended, I went to my Princesse Appartment, where I so represented the violence of my Passion,  & the hopefull opportunity of now imploring hir Brothers permission of rendring it as happy as 'twas great, that my importu are Prayers extorted a graunt from hir words which hir Blushes & disorder acquainted me with before. Never (generous Artabbanes) never was there any thing greater than my joy at this concession, but my Feares & tremblings when I implor'd it. oh Gods! what did I not say to my Princesse, that I could say no more? & what vowes did I not make, that my constancy should be as great as my felicity? The Euening of this blessed day, as I was goeing to cast my selfe at my Kings Feete, and to implore a graunt which was as impossible to be desir'd with too-much humblenesse as to be receiu'd with too-much extacie, I mett a Gentleman sent from him for me, who I desir'd to acquaint me whether he knew the Cause, he told me that he could not immagin it vnlesse it were a Packett which was then deliver'd him by an Expresse. I shall not (continu'd Artavasdes) be asham'd to tell you that I trembl'd, lest this might be some new Allarme of going to the Feild, and in that apprehension I came into the Kings Closset where he had no sooner lockt the Dore than he told me. I hope Artavasdes you are not ignorant, that if my resentments for your services are not as great as they themselves, yet at least they are as I am capable of, but that I may be oblig'd to your reason aswell as to your goodnesse for so charitable an opinion, I have sent for you, to conjure you without any Ceremonies, to name your Reward; which I shalbe as pleas'd to conferre on you, as you can be to receive,  & if it be one which can satisfy your desert, I shall more value my Power by that effect than by any other. Artabazus having thus spoake, fixt his Eyes upon me, and I mine on the ground, with so much confusion in my lookes and gestures, that he read in my silence what I was not able to acquaint him by my words. Well Artavasdes (he continu'd) since you seeme to give me your election, whether it proceeds from your modesty or the merit of your performances that leaves me but one way to recompence them; I must tell you, the former and the latter directs me to reward both by the guift of Altezeera, who, if I be not much mistaken, will find hir owne satisfaction in yours, & in my Gratitude. oh Gods! (continu'd Artavasdes) you only know my transports at those ravishing words, which were no sooner spoke, than I prostrated my selfe at my Kings Feete, embrac'd his knees and told him, ah Sir, I beseech you doe not mention Reward or Gratitude when you doe the Princesse Altezeera, nor so much wrong the blessing of your guift as to tearme it a recompence, since it is so farre above manifesting you are gratefull, that by it I am render'd vncapable of ever being so Great Gods! I cry'd out lesten my felicity by some affliction, least I doe not long possesse it. Yes Artavasdes (my King reply'd) you shall possesse Altezeera, your not demanding hir increases your Title to hir, and I finde my selfe asmuch ty'd to this Gratitude by your humility as by your services; but to limit that joy whose greatnesse you apprehend may destroy itselfe, and to show how soone the Gods have graunted what you so earnestly implor'd, you must a while suspend the fruition, to act that which may induce my Kingdome to esteeme me as just in conferring my Sister on you, as I doe therin esteeme my selfe. Thereupon (comanding me to rise) he gave me a letter from Annexander to him, and another directed to me, both which I read, and found they contain'd, that he had bin receiv'd at Rome with a magnificence which testify'd his welcome, but in the highest of his Negotiating, the Gods had struck him with a lingring Sicknesse, which most of the Phisicians assur'd him would be as tedious as irrecoverable, that therefore he implor'd that I might be sent (if Armenia were in Peace) with Power and instructions to perfect the Treaty, in case he ended his Life before it, and commanded me to doe him the last office of closing his Eyes, or if I came too late for that duty, yet at least to celebrate his Funeralls. Consider (I beseech you) how sad an influence this vnfortunat Packet had on me, and how in one moment the Gods convinc't me that neither joy nor greife could destroy me, I should for ever have acknowledg'd the confineing my felicity by affliction, and the quallifying my sorrow by happinesse had bin their Providence, if since, I had not found it their Cruelty, for they made me able to conquer those extreames but to preserve me for greater; what need I tell you more, than that my duty to my King, my Country, and my Father, made me passe an enguadgement to vndertake the voyage, and to mittigate the cause and trouble of it, Artabazus by many assurances, accompany'd by as many vowes, told me at my returne, I should be establisht in a felicity which he long'd asmuch to conferr on me, as I could to possesse it. I omitted to acquaint you there was another Letter to Lindesia from Anexander, who receiv'd the newes of hir Husbands sicknesse with a constancy that render'd hir vnworthy the affliction; but assoone as I retir'd from Artabazus, I went to my Princesse, who perceiving so high a sadnesse in my Face, was so much a Freind to my Passion as to beleive nothing but a misfortune in it could have created so large a one; and in that Faith askt me, whether hir Brother had bin so vnjust as to esteeme his allyance a greater reward than my services meritted? I was infinitly asham'd at this question, and that I should be capable of so transcendent a melancholly (having my felicity graunted) as to induce my Princesse to suspect it had bin deny'd. In this perplexity I continu'd in a silence that increast hir doubts, but assoone as I was able to suppresse them, I did, by acquanting hir what had past betwixt my King and me, and how that I was never so neere my blessing, and yet never was so like to be distant from it. This separation and Anexanders danger, the Faire Altezeera concluded was very sensible, since the joy of Artabazus graunt could not intirely console me, which induc'd hir to suspend hir owne afflictions (for Anexanders condition) to lessen mine, that by the knowledge of hirs could not but receive a large accession. But when shee came to discourse upon my absence, and to bring reasons to quallify the hardnesse of it, alas they were so farre from bearing that name, or from produceing that effect, that hir esteeming they were so, or that they could be thought so by me, created a greater misery than shee endeavour'd to silence. But the necessity of my journy to Rome, either as a Sonne, or as a Subject, made me more firme in my resolution of vndertaking it than Altezeera's not appearing sensible of it, and though perhapps shee lessen'd hir disorder that it might have a resembling operation on mine, yet it produc'd a contrary effect, and made me tell hir, shee had more Fortitude than Loue: But though I apprehended nothing more than leaving my Princesse; yet for three dayes (during which my dispatch was making) I did nothing when I was out of hir company, but waite upon my King to hasten it; The Euening of the last day, coming to his Chamber, I found him writing, and in great perplexities, sometymes blotting out what he had written, then flinging away his Penn & tearing his Paper, I was something surpriz'd at this, but at last turning his Lookes by chaunce where I was, he seem'd asmuch surpriz'd at my having seene his disorder, as I was at it, but having somewhat copos'd himselfe, he call'd me to him, and told me smiling, Artavasdes, it may be you doe asmuch wonder at that litle fury I am in, as you will at the cause, which I will tell you, not only that you may remove it, but be convinc't that I have nothing of reserve from my Brother, for that name I will henceforth give you. Know then, that what Altezeera's Eyes have acted in you, another Lady's have in me, and though by many vowes I have profest to have now a Passion only for hir, yet as an argument of hir power or distrust, shee will receive no satisfaction but of a letter to my abandon'd Mistris that I have deserted hir, and of another to hir selfe, that I only adore hir, which hard sentence I was obeying when you came in, but having never bin blest with a fortunate expression, I found my selfe more troubl'd to act my obedience than to vndertake it, and since you are so happyly present, I will make use of your stile that my Mistris may be asmuch satisfy'd with it, as with my Passion. I was more perplext to obey his commands than to learne them, for I was not ignorant Artabazus was addicted to a Passion, which if plac't upon a perfect object for a legittimate end, deserves a nobler name; but knowing that the Flames of Kings are apter to consume virtue than cherrish it, I was vnwilling to shew my ignorance in a cause which I too much detested to serve at so deare a rate; and therefore excus'd my selfe of the former by the latter; but Artabazus was so pressing that at length being more vanquisht by his importunities than reasons, having perfectly receiv'd his instructions, to follow them I write this former letter to the Forsaken, and this latter to the ador'd Mistris. The first Letter was,  acknowledge that constancy to you after hauing seene Hir, is too-great a weaknesse to be esteemed a virtue, Those vowes therefore I have made you, I doe not only recall, but giue you leaue to doe the like with yours, and though you should lose asmuch by the bargaine as I doe gaine, yet you cannot more deplore that losse than I should the losse of that tyme I should spend in your seruice, after having seene my new Conqueror.  The Second Letter was,  the Beauty that inspir'd it, I haue to obey your Commands sent hir (that first made me a Lover), a Declaration that I am no longer hirs; But doe not beleiue I can be vnconstant to you, because I haue bin so to hir, since your Beauty, the cause of my first change, renders me vncapable of a second, and that which made me act one fault, wilbe my security of not acting another.  passionatly enjoyn'd my silence, especially to Altezeera whose scrupulous virtue (as he said) might thinke that a Crime which was but a diversion, he desir'd me immediatly to retire, that he might transcribe, and send them, and comanded me two howres after to come and receive my finall dispatch for Rome, which by then should be finisht. The short tyme which I found was left me, I dedicated to the Faire Altezeera, who I found had more constancy to discourse of my departure, than to see it. I will not perticularize all was said when I tooke my leave, which I did with so deepe a melancholy, that I have often since consider'd it a Prophecy and not a weaknesse, my Princesse too, perceiving it's greatnesse participated of it, and practic'd a weaknesse hir selfe, which shee had condemn'd in me;  & it may be suspecting my feares had as great a share in it as my separation, shee told me, Artavasdes, I have hitherto determin'd to give you no pretence to Altezeera but what you had by your services and hir inclination, but to fortify your Title which I find your absence and sorrow will need, I here protest by all things I hold in highest Veneration, as long as you honor me with your affection, I will pay you mine; I am now ty'de to you by Religion aswell as gratitude, which are bonds I cannot cancell, without rendring my selfe as vnfitt for all other men, as vnworthy of Artavasdes. And I (I reply'd, casting my selfe at hir Feete) doe protest by Altezeera, who not to adore, is a higher sinn than to doe it, that not only I will have a Passion for hir whilst shee blesses me with a reciprocall one, but continue mine though shee should prove so vnmercifully just as to recall hirs. The faire Altezeera then permitting me to kisse hir hand, hastily retir'd into hir Cabbinet, left I might have perceiv'd those teares, which at once would have given the wound and the cure. From my Princesse's Appartment I went to Lyndesia's, who perhaps with more sorrow, but lesse demonstration of it, sawe my departure; and because shee had then receiv'd the Picture of Vdosia my only Sister, which I was much taken with (who had hir education in a Principality that belong'd to Anexander, & who then began to disclose a Beauty, which I should without flattery have thought vnparalleld, had I not seene Altezeera's and the faire Parthenissa's) shee gave it me aswell to satisfy my request, as to convince the Romans, that in one of those Nations which their Pride call'd Barbarous, there was a Beauty to punnish it. At last by my Kings consent having left the generous Phanasder (who then declar'd himselfe a votary to love) my Leiutenant in Armenia, with a small Equipage I left Thospia, and having past through Cilicia and Pamphilia, I arriv'd at Lidia, where lighting upon a good Shipp, I crost the  Ægaean Sea and landing at Athens, which I then found as famous for hir ruins as shee had bin for hir learning, there I left one of my Domesticke Servants (who I much trusted) by reason of a great indisposition he was visited with. From Athens by land wee travell'd to Cornith, which stands upon that litle Isthmos that seperates Morea from Achaia, From Corinth wee went to Seutica, from thence in a Roman Gally crossing the Gulph of Tyrrhene and the Ionian Sea I came to Terentum, but with much hazard (for your Army) at length to Rome, where I found the virtuous Annexander had concluded the Treaty, but still continuing vnder such a languishing, that my Greife for it could not transcend the Phisitians wonder at it. There I told him with repetitions all that had happen'd in Armenia, how my joyes attended but my returne and his recovery, to be consummated; I shew'd him too the young Vdozia's Picture, which he consider'd with the admiration it meritted, and lifting up his hands only implor'd the Gods to protract his Life still he sawe the faire Altezeera in my possession, & the Originall of that Coppy. Whilst I resided in that great Citty, the Fame of the generous Artabbanes so fill'd it, though vnder a Name, which, (had not Fortune lov'd Rome more than virtue) he had impos'd on all the Italians, that after the defeate of Gellius and Lentulus, not only that Army which was by Annexanders Treaty to invade Parthia vnder Marcus Crassus, was stoppt; but Pompey who then was as farre on his returne as Dyrrachium, was by divers expresses comanded to transport his forces into Italy, where if he preseru'd the Roman Empire, he would winne more glory than he had done by so much inlargeing it; But when by your valour and conduct the two Intelligences came of Mummius & Crassus defeate, the Senate immediatly were assembl'd, & though they shew'd a magnanimity as great as their danger, yet I easily perceiv'd, it proceeded more from their dissembling than their Nature. The result of that meeting was to fortify Crassus broaken Troopes, with all those which could be immediatly drawne out of Garrisons, or leauyed, & to comand him to put the fate of Rome to a Battell, that if the Gods had destin'd hir subversion, shee might fall like hir Selfe. The fame and necessity of this decision drew vnder Crassus Ensignes all the Gallantry of Italy, and because we were to be companions of fortune in another Warre, I resolv'd to be his in this, when by Annexanders permission I was; The Roman Generall at my arrivall in his Campe, offer'd me such Comands, that I esteem'd, not to have declin'd them, an injustice as great as his Civility, but though I refus'd participating in his Commission yet I could not in his Councells and Intelligences, where I learn'd how Artabbanes virtue which could not have bin Conquer'd, was sold; The strange inundations which happened then facilitated our overtaking you but your martch to Rome so Allarm'd it, that the Senate inuited Annexander to remove into the Capitoll, lest the Citty might not prove a secure Sanctuary; but that generous Prince declin'd it, to convince them he vnderstood their Complement as 'twas meant, which was, rather to manifest their care, than their apprehension. At length that fatall day came, wherein I lift up my prophane Arme against the perfectest of Men, and in which I had receiu'd the reward of an ignorance I could not excuse (since I could not attribute without injustice the miracles Spartacus did, to any other Sword than that of Artabbanes) had not he thought the greatest punishment was, to shew me my offence. Artabbanes could not heare those Civilities without interrupting them, which he did, to tell Artavasdes, You might more justly say (generous Freind) that for ignoreing by your prodigious valour who was the Master of it and for preserving my selfe so long after having outliv'd my defeate, you punnisht both those Crimes, by sparing a Life, which if then taken away, had bin exempted from torments that can never cease but with it. I beleive (said Artavasdes) it wilbe a lesse trouble to you to heare the continuation of my Adventures, than to finde out matter to commend mee, and in that Faith I will prosecute them. But because the virtuous Callimmachus had heard all 'till our arrivall at Rome, I will from thence continue my Relation. Assoone as Crassus was return'd to the Senate, who deny'd him the honor of the Tryumph, not but that his successe meritted it, but because (as they said) the Persons did not against whome 'twas wonne, and that he himselfe had refus'd the Ovatio- Triumph, which he esteem'd asmuch too-lowe in one extreame, as his Lords esteem'd the other too-high in a contrary one; He was immediatly dispatch't with his Army towards Parthia, taking Greece and the lesser Asia in his way, and though Annexander by fervent Commands enjoyn'd my returne with the Roman Generall,  & to leave his Death or recovery to the Gods, yet my duty submitted to my Passion, & that which made me confident that the latter would not be suspended by the former for above a Moone, was, the Phisitians confident assureing me within that tyme Annexander would be past hope, or past danger; I know too, that Crassus martching with a vast Army, I might give him so much advance, & yet overtake him before he could begin the Warre, besides, I esteem'd it my duty to endeavour the Prince Tygranes deliverance, who was dayly expected at Rome, but my highest motiue of continuing longer there was, to enjoy the blessing of Artabbanes conversation, whose company made me so much a Freind to my selfe, and none to gratitude, as to rejoyce at his wounds, and pray against their speedy cure; and since I have begun to tell you my Crimes I will not conceale any of them, for I was too in some manner satisfy'd, that by your Kings cruelties you were out of a Capacity of commanding the Warre, and of preserving him in a power to continue it, which though from thence I promist my selfe successe, yet my joy had not so poore a cause, but deriu'd its being from a certainty, that thereby I should not imploy my Life against the Preserver of it; all these motiues the Gods rais'd for my ruine, which happen'd by my continuance in Rome, where I receiu'd a losse, which neither the Empire of it, not all those of the world can repaire. As soone as Crassus had past the Adriattick Sea, the same Fleet which transported his Army out of Italy, brought Pompey's into it, he was receiv'd all the way in Tryumph, but especially at Rome, where notwithstanding the generous Ventidius and my prayers the vnfortunate Tygranes compos'd a part of it. This miserable Prince who had in a short tyme resented the two greatest extreames, was no more able to endure the latter, than he had bin to keepe the former; and though he were not blest with resolution enough to oppose the vice, yet he was to avoyde the shame of it, which he evinc't by the sad demonstration of becoming his owne Executioner. The Gods shall be my record, that I shed Teares of greife for the death of him, that would have shed some of a contrary nature for mine, though too, by his fall I was then in a certainty of possessing Armenia, which by a legittimate succession was to descend to the faire Altezeera, for though Artabazus had a Sonne call'd Artaxias, and that he was borne after his mother was crown'd Queene, yet being begotten vnlawfully (which blemish, the King esteem'd the Marriage would deface) all the Armenian Nobility consider'd him rather as their Princes shame, than his successor, especially too, when to be vnjust to Altezeera was to be so vnto themselves, since to have declin'd hir Rule, was to have declin'd the Rule of virtue. But though Tygranes dy'd not like a Prince, yet he was interrd like one, and no sooner were the solemnitines finisht of that funerall, than I fell into so violent a sicknesse, that Ventidius who never was from my Bedds- side, beleiv'd my owne would be the next to be celebrated, neither for above halfe a Moone could he finde any cause to retract that opinion; but assoone as my amendment begann to dissipate his feares, I assum'd them for him, & indeed to the best of my memory I never observ'd so strange an alteration in so short a tyme; For that quicknesse in his looke which was admir'd where ever it was seene, now was asmuch for the change, his Eyes were dull & languishing, his humor was resembling them, his discourses were as voyde of reason as formerly they had bin replenisht with it, in a word I cannot better describe the condition he then was in, than to the contrary in which I first had the honor to know him; I suspected a while his care and continuall watching, had created the alteration, and in that Faith I apprehended the cleering of my doubts, but lest I might by ignoreing the occasion of his disorder, not offer him my assistance to suppresse it, I cast out some oblique words which might acquaint him with my desires, but he was so farre from esteeming them a Rise to disclose his paine, that he continu'd in a perfect silence, from all things but sighs. This proceeding induc'd me to beleive his sufferings were for me, because he appear'd so vnwilling to discover them to me; I therefore told him I was apprehensive his care of me, had created mine for him. Yes Artavasdes (he reply'd, with a languishing accent) my care of you makes me take none of my selfe, nor deserue it, and then with Eyes bigg with Teares, he left me; but my admiration at it did not for three dayes, during which tyme he never gave me the favour of a visit. So strange a proceeding had cast me into a relapse, but that I esteem'd my health necessary to finde Ventidius out, & learne what the avoyding me, and my sicknesse gave me no hopes otherwise to expect. But the Euening of the fourth day, as I lay slumbring on my Bedd, Ventidius came into my Camber, so softly, that I heard him not, and had not some groanes whose violence he could not suppresse, given me notice of his being there, I had by not knowing his torment, longer continu'd it; he seated himselfe by a Table on which he lean'd both his Elbowes, and his cheekes upon his hands, his Eyes were fixt upon some object I could not discover, though I could all things else he did by gentle opening of the Courten. I had not bin long in expectation, but mine was rewarded by Ventidius saying with a lowe voyce, oh Gods! is it possible that a liberty and a Freindship I have hitherto preserv'd and glory'd in, should now be destroy'd, by that which perhapps is only an effect of Arte and not of Nature, & which (may be) has an existence only in the sight? but (he cotinu'd, after a short silence) thy fate is not singular, thou hast heard of a Pigmalion and a Narcissus, the follyes of which were not as great as of those that condemn'd them; for Beauty is only that which passes the Eyes, and the maddnesse is not as high to adore a move-lesse redd & white adorn'd with perfect symmetry of Partes, & though dead, has a liveing aire and vivacity, as to have a passion for an Inhabitant of a Clyme, where the Sunns brightnesse engendr'd their obscurity, and makes a constant Night dwell upon their Faces; Were there sett rules for Beauty the World would have but one Mistris, & their Fancyes are more extravagant that dote upo a Face they seldome see, and never but arm'd with frownes where (were I one of their Votaries) that which demonstrats their Cruelty, should render it more than myne, who can enjoy my Mistris Beauty without fearing my presumption should cloude it: where I can breath my Passion without apprehending any punishment: & if silence be consent, without suspecting a denyall, I feare nor Age nor sicknesse to impaire the object of my Flame: I can excuse my Love by allwayes demonstrating the Creator of it, when others in a few yeares, must be oblig'd to our Faiths, to beleive they were not as blinde as the Boy they worshipp't; & their felicity consists in, (what I should esteeme a torment) the remembrance of what they have bin, whereas mine constists in the possession of what it is; Their Sumer must admitt of an Autumne, Mine is a spring that is continuall,  & though indeed it beares nothing but leaves; yet those doe never fall, and for all those advantages, I am depriv'd of nothing but fruition, which some have determind & found rather a cure than a reward of Love. This I have to say if it be only a Picture, but oh Gods! what can I if it be a Coppy? (as certainly it is, for Nature surpasses Arte) and 'tis a greater Miracle that Man should fancy such a perfection, than that the Gods should create it. But alas (Ventidius continu'd, folding his Armes & hanging downe his head) 'twere more for thy felicity that this were a Fancy than a reallity, for thou might'st with greater confidence and hope expect a resignation from Artavasdes of the former, than if it were the latter; & be beter satisfy'd with the possession of a lesse happinesse by the gallantry of thy Freind, than the greatest by the cryme of becoming his Ryvall. I could (said Artavasdes) have longer list'ned to his rationall extravagancyes, had I not esteem'd it a Sinn to build my diversion upon my Freinds sufferings, but as I was about to silence them, I heard him say, what, Ventidius? is Love then really capable of that mistery which Lovers ascribe vnto it? the changeing of hearts? & hast thou already so effeminate a one as to apprehend with tremblings to disclose thy condition to thy Freind? If he be not virtuous enough to excuse thy Sinn; be thou to punnish it? & by the gallantry of thy performance make him acknowledge, that to have continu'd his Ryvall had bin a lesse injury than so to have remou'd him. Then riseing up, I perceiv'd in his hand an enamell'd Boxe cover'd with Diamonds, which soone made me know 'twas Vdozia's Picture which had created this violent conflict. I made a little noyse to let him know I was awake, which he no sooner heard, than he came to my Bedds-side, where kneeling downe he open'd the Case in a perfect agony, and ask't me, Artavasdes, doe you love this Picture? Yes (I reply'd) but the Originall much better. Oh Gods (said he) then you cannot any longer Love Ventidius. You are mistaken (I reply'd) and to evince that Truth, I give you my permission to love it too; Alas he reply'd you may doe that without feare, when you continue my Ryvall, for shee must have asmuch imbecility as beauty, should shee for the vnfortunate Ventidius, decline the happy Artavasdes. I know (said I smileing) nothing of hir, but what you see, & that hir Name is Vdozia. Great Gods! (said Ventidius starting up) how came you then by hir Picture? and are you then the courted Party? No (I reply'd) I am confident, of all the World shee would not have Artavasdes for hir husband, and yet I beleive there is few shee loves better. My reason (said Ventidius) is asmuch lost in those words, as my liberty to the Subject of them. I hope (I reply'd) I have given you so much satisfaction as not to suspect me your Ryvall: If I have not already, I protest by our inviolable Freindship, of all the Women in the World I would not make Vdozia my Wife, & much lesse endeavour or hope to enjoy hir by an illegittimate way. You confound me (said Ventidius) asmuch as shee does, and if you delightted not to torment your Freind, you would not so long continue my suspension. I will finish it (said I, embraceing him) with an assurance, that if you can like the Originall aswell as the Coppy, shee shalbe Ventidius'es; as an earnest of which Truth, I acquaint you shee is my Sister. He that could describe the generous Romans extacy's & joy's, must have resented then, for I that saw them cannot, but when they were enough dimminisht to continue our discourses, I told him, he had said so many pertinent things of a Passion for a Picture, that I conjur'd him to accept of Vdozia's, that when tyme had ruin'd hir Beauty, he might preserve something to extenuate his extravagancy. Ventidius a thousand tymes kist the present, and as many tymes embrac't me for the bestowing it; I then told him, 'twas not amisse to lett Annexander know of his designe whilst he resided in Rome, that he might be the more certaine of Vdozia's Passion, which he could not doubt when it would be both an effect of hir Iudgement, and hir Duty. No (said Ventidius) I will aske hir more handsomly than so, for I will at the head of 50000 Romans come and implore hir in Armenia, shee shall see vnder my Ensignes, Forces that will give hir by their virtue, those Kingdomes, hirs doe merit, & which my birth deny'd me; for I will not presume to declare my selfe hir Servant, 'till I can weare Crownes of Lawrell, and present hir with those of Empire. Yes generous Artavasdes, I now repent my selfe I declin'd that Army (afterwards conferr'd on Crassus) but now I have the ambition to command, I shall not long be without one; I will make Glory my advocate aswell as you, and 'tis fitt I should be miserable did I expect any other way to felicity. To contract my Narration, After I had assur'd Ventidius I would so fill Vdozia's Brest with the Caracter of his virtue, that shee should be asmuch taken with his Fame, as he was with hir Picture, and that he did injure hir to talke of Kingdomes after shee was Ventidius's, he retir'd himselfe in such raptures of joy, that in few dayes he retourn'd to his former health, But alas! I was no sooner to mine, that the Gods cast me into a relapse, whose cause was worse than the disease: 'Twas the death of Annexander: to which misfortune I pay'd so many Teares, that I thought (though falsly) their store had bin exhausted; Never did any death more conuince me there was another Life than his; for had not he bin satisfy'd of that Truth, he could not have yeelded himselfe up to eternall ashes with so absolute a resignation. Great Gods! (continu'd Artavasdes) why did you not then acquaint me how miserable I was, that I might have left the world when Annexander did? and have had so sure a way to eternall felicity as the following of him, and that in the effects of my duty, I might have found those of your Mercy: But alas, you had destin'd me to be as vnparallel'd in suffering, as in Love: & thereby (I hope) instructed me there is a reward in another world, since my constancy is deny'd one in this. [These passionat words both Artabbanes and Callimmachus sympathiz'd in, which made Artavasdes the sooner finish them, which he did by thus resuming his discourse after he had begg'd their pardon for having interrupted it.] Before Anneaxnders Funerall, by passionate perswassions of one of his most confident Servants, I caus'd his body to be open'd, wherein (alas) I too-visibly found he was sent to the Gods by the wickednesse of Men, which being not (discover'd) dureing his Life made me not wonder that the Senate had once expell'd the Phisitians out of Rome, for in this experiment I found, 'twas their ignorance, and not their Profession which was banisht; But this sadd misfortune & discovery, with my impossibility of disclosing the Poysoner, cast me into a violent feaver, wherein, though those wee adore were not so mercifull as to end my miseries and my Life, yet they were so just as to discover who wickedly would have bin so charitable: for I had retain'd all my Fathers Domesticks, and being prescrib'd after my Phisick the drinking of some broth, as it stood warming by the fire, one of those litle Doggs which are so common and so much cherisht in Rome, came & lappt it all up, but no sooner had he bin my Taster, than he began to reele, then to swell, and at last, fell dead by the Bed-side. This happen'd whilst Ventidius was present, who remembring how Annexander dy'd, enquir'd of Philanax, who had made the Broth, and having learnt? it was one of my Fathers Cookes, he immediatly went downe, seiz'd upon him and presented his naked Ponnyard to his Brest, in the apprehension of Death, he discover'd that which made him desire and thinke it a happinesse, but as he was readdy to expire, observing Ventidius & Philanax were Spectators of his execution, he begg'd, and obtain'd leave to speake with them privatly, where he told them, that to disburthen his Conscience of a load which might sinke it into eternall darknesse, he acknowledg'd, that 'twas he which by a lingring Poyson had Murther'd Annexander, & that he had bin hir'd to that Sinn by Crassolis. This Intelligence (after Iustice had past on the Crimminall) the only knowers of it told me, I kept it private lest the Traytor, by the knowledge of the discovery, might avoyd the punishment of it. But though I had in one Moone cast off my sicknesse, yet I did not recover my health, & was told should not 'till I chang'd the Ayre. Ventidius immediatly offer'd me a magnificent Palace of his which stood by the Sea-side within the Gulfe of Tarentum, whither I went after having tooke leave of the generous Artabbanes who I could not perswade to remove thither 'till his wounds were perfectly cur'd, & unto whome I promis'd to returne, that I might enjoy the felicity of his company as farre as Armenia, but I never had the blessing to see him since, 'till by his presence I not only receiu'd my Life, but the rellish of it too. Some Tenn dayes after my arrivall at Ventidius's, by that excellent Ayre I recover'd strength enough to walke abroade,  & as we were diverting our selves by the Sea-side, we saw a Gally cast Anchor in the Rode, and man out a Boate to land hir Passengers, where to my admiration I found one of them was the gallant Falintus, who at first seeing me, put on a joyfull Looke, which his Face was so litle accustom'd to, that I obseru'd it was soone expell'd as an Intruder. But oh Gods! why doe I protract the disclosing my Miseries, since I complaine their having given me no more is a misfortune because formerly they have given me so many? Yes (Artabbanes) 'twas Falintus told me that Artabazus had displac'd Phanasder assoone as I was gone: that by discontenting so gallant a Man he had lost the Hearts of all those which boare that Title: That he had lost a great Battell to Arsaces and Pacorus: his Army being lead by one of Crassolis's Creatures, who the Common-Souldiers had Sacrific'd to their Fury (to robb the Parthians of the Glory of an entire victory by acting of aparte of it themselves): That Artabazus, Lindesia and Altezeera, had bin shutt up in Thospia: and (oh Gods! that I live to tell it!) that the last, Here the Miserable Artavasdes had not fortitude enough to resist the remembrance of his losse, but abandon'd himselfe to effeminacyes, which made both Artabbanes & Callimmachus more pitty, than condemne them. The generous Armenian was above halfe an hower e're he could dry up his Teares, or silence his sighes, but assoone as he had gotten the victory of those Passions which had so lately gotten it of him, he made use of it to continue his Story, which he thus did with the sorrow & attention of the Hearers. PARTHENISSA. THE SECOND PARTE THE SECOND BOOKE. Falintus's Intelligence, because I thought the remembrance of those Miseries would have deny'd me the possibility of their full relation, but now I finde, that those Gods which gave me the fortitude to beare my Afflictions, will give me too that of repeating them, I will deduce the Story from it's Originall not only because I esteeme the strange changes, and intricacies it is replenisht with, worthy your attention, but that by the knowledge of my sufferings, I may be oblig'd to your reason asmuch as goodnesse, to pardon those effeminacyes, which I beleive (only, and then absolutely) excusable, when you learne their cause. You may remember, I told you that I mett the generous Falintus at his landing, as Ventidius and I was diverting our selves upon a pleasant Strand, not farre from his Palace; where Falintus desir'd me to retire, since his intelligence was of a length, which by continuing me where I was, might impaire a health he found by my lookes was but newly restor'd; I obey'd this request,  & we were no sooner retourn'd than locking our selues upp in my Cabbinet, Falintus addressing his discourse to me, began it in these words. As soone as you were so farre from Armenia, as Crassolis was confident you could not receive intelligence tyme enough to prevent his practices; the first he disclos'd, was, the annihillating the gallant Phanasders Comission, and the conferring it on a Creature of his owne, both which he effected by the vnlimmitted power he has over his King, & though Altezeera and Orodes too, were vnsatisfy'd with it, yet the latter had bin more to have declin'd his Favourits Councell; But no sooner was Phanasder retir'd to his Government, than Pacorus with all the Gallantry of Parthia (which by Pompey's precipitate returne to Rome was safely vnited in one Body) presented himselfe on the Bankes of Euphrates, absolutely determin'd to repeate, or repaire his disgrace; some were of opinion that Phanasders displaceing gave him the invitation to invade us; others thought he began the Warre upon intelligence of Annexanders Treaty at Rome, with hopes to determine it before Crassus could come either to divert him, or assist us; whether the causes were great I know not, but I am sure the successe was, for the Armenian Army consisting of those who fought for Pay and not for Glory (all of the latter quality having flung up their Commission with Phanasder) and the Generall being one whose sudden elevation had astonisht him, The Armenians in the first Battell were render'd vncapable of a second, for they left above 40000 on the place, but that which dimminisht the losse was the addition of one unto it, their Generall. This victory being too-infamous to be insisted on, I will passe it over to tell you the effects it produc't: one of the first was the invironing of Tygranocerta (neere which it was wonne) next morning with an Army of 30000 Horse; where the King (with the Princesse in his Company) had remov'd, the better to act upon any emergency; But Artabazus found himselfe no sooner beseidg'd, than he repented (but would not repaire) his injury to Phanasders Authority, & to yours, which was violated in his. As soone as the newes was divuld'g in Parthia that Artabazus was beseidg'd, with as litle hope of releife, as resistance, Arsaces came in person to Tygranocerta, where he solemnly protested he would be reveng'd for the blood of his Subjects at Offala, and for Artabazus having hir'd the Romans to his destruction. The gallant Phanasder at the intelligence of his Kings Misfortune, forgetts his injury to remember his duty; neither were the tye's of Freindship and Love, lesse invitations to his performances, the first of those were on your scoare to the Princesse Altezeera, and the latter on his owne to the Princesse Theoxcena, to whome Tygranocerta not only belong'd, but was then the place of hir residence; & who indeed was blest with such charmes both of the body & minde, that Phanasder was as vnable as vnwilling to resist them. But why doe I so much abuse the faire Theoxcena, & my selfe, as to indeavour to give you a description of a person that is above any? & who, if I be not much mistakn, you did assiduously visit in your Freinds favour, alitle before you left Armenia. I must confesse (I reply'd) that assoone as Phanasder had acquainted me with his passion, I acquainted Theoxcena with it, and with the merit of hir Servants; of which shee was so absolutly convinc't, that upon that scoare, shee not only pardon'd, but receiv'd his Flame, and being at his owne disposall, shee thought no argument could more evince how much shee meritted that liberty, than to give hir selfe to Phanasder, without those nice formalities, authoriz'd rather from Custome than Reason; & besides, shee esteem'd it both an injury to hir owne election, and hir Servants virtues, only to be satisfy'd of their greatnesse, by tyme. This generous declaration, my concerne in my Freind, & his impatience, made me the more solicitous before my departure, to bring this Affaire to a conclusion which might be vncapable of change. I beleive (said Falintus) you have so well effected that designe, that if all hir Sexe were as constant as Theoxcena, I had bin exempted from an employment which I detest, though in it you may finde I will decline nothing for your Service, since I doe it not when 'tis to your trouble: But whilst Phanasder was levying of Forces to hinder, or at least protract the losse of Tygranocerta, he receiv'd an advertisment from thence, that his Kings Feare, or weaknesse, had made him already offer to capitulate with Arsaces, upon tearmes so lowe, that an absolute Ruine had bin a fitter election, who yet return'd him word, that he fought not for Glory, but Revenge  & Empire, and therefore the destruction, and not the submission of his Enemyes, should be the evincement of his successe, This answer made Phanasder conclude, that either Arsaces cruelty, or advantage was great, & to hinder both, (finding that to raise an Army would be a worke of Tyme, and consequently of danger,) with 3000 select Horse, he advanc'd towards Tygranocerta, & at Noone day passing over the bellyes of as many Parthians, with the losse of 300, enter'd the Towne, and so much reviu'd the Beseiged's hopes, and the Kings goodnesse, that the former cast away their feares, and the latter his ingratitude. There Theoxcena's reception of hir Servant, was more full of satisfaction to him, than the Tryumph; but that all our Enemyes might know, as well as heare of the releife; Phanasder and I, (for I had the honor to be with him and to compose a third parte of his Forces) made such briske, and succesfull Sallyes, that though the Number of the Fighters hinder'd them from the name of Battells, yet the number of the dead would have made them thought so; which so transported Arsaces, that he solemnly protested Tygranocerta should be either his Tombe, or Artabazus's, and it may be we had made him keepe the first part of his vowe, had not the divine Sword destroy'd more lives than the Parthian; for not long after our flinging our selves into Tygranocerta there fell into it from Heaven (if such a Curse can come from thence) a Mortality of so strange a nature, that nothing hardly could prove a preservative for the sound, or a Cure for the infected; so that to be sick, & to be dead, were the same; This strange contagion so suddenly devour'd our Forces, that Phanasder himselfe consented to capitulate, but our Enemyes knew too well our conditions, to graunt us any; so that many began to thinke that plague no misfortune. But Phanasder to make Arsaces beleive both his Intelligence, and his hopes were false, placeing the Women on the Walls, with all the Men, and Gallantry of the Garrison, he made so furious a Sally, that above 4000 Phartians were sent into the other World, to lament their Kings being inexorable in this: and doubtlesse wee had carry'd our successe to the height of making him asmuch neede our humanity, as we did his, had not the Prince Pacorus (passing with all his Army over a Bridge of Boates on the River Nicephorus, which separated the City and the two Campes) come, not only to his Fathers releife, but rescue; For Phanasder had taken Arsaces with his owne hand: but as he was retreating with the Father, the Sonne fell with all his fresh Troops on ours (which were ryr'd and shatter'd) and forc'd not only the King but the victory from us; though Phanasder not to lose his Prisoner, did almost, his Life, for he receiu'd some such vnhappy wounds, that making the retreate with our Swords, just as he was enter'd the Gates, he totter'd upon his Horse, & had doubtlesse fallen, but that I caught him in my Armes, 'till further helpe came to carry him to his bedd, whither he was no sooner brought, than my wounds as dangerous as his, suncke me downe into a swoond by him. And though his action was great, yet because his successe was not, he fell into so deepe a melancholly and despaire, that nothing but Theoxcenas safety (which shee protested was involu'd in his,) could induce him to permitt the Chirurgions to search and dresse his wounds. Arsaces on the other side assum'd a rage as great, as the danger he had lately bin in, and by reitterated vowes left himselfe as litle power, as will to be mercifull; Pacorus having receiu'd the Elogie due to his Successe & Gallantry, return'd to his owne Campe, from whence that day he had not mou'd, but that those which were to give him a false Allarme, did it so vnfortunatly, that their intention was both discover'd and punnisht; But though their losse in the Parthian Armyes were great; yet their joyes were so too, for they consider'd our last attempt as if it were to have bin so; neither indeed were they false Prophets in that conjecture, for the Souldiers by loosing Phanasder, not only lost their Leader, but their Inspirer; & before his wounds permitted him the power of revenging them, or increasing their number, those of the Garrison were so dimminisht that he could hardly command, or obey any but himselfe. In this extremity when we expected a generall ruine, we found a generall safety. The Gods be prays'd, (I cry'd out interrupting him, (for though I were not present, yet I was a sufferer in the Danger.) Ah (Sir said Falintus) you are too-prodigall of your gratitude, for when you are instructed in the cause of our preservation I feare it will involue you in greater troubles than we were free'd from; but not to anticipate your greifes, I will tell you my Story in order. The same day in which Phanasder purchas'd so much glory and so little advantage, amongst many of the Armenians which then receiu'd their Fate, Crassolis's only Sonne was peirc't with so many wounds, that though wee made our retreat with so slowe a pace, that we might have fetcht off any of our wounded, yet that young Gentleman was so mortally, that none of his Freinds esteem'd him worthy the carrying home, or declin'd the doing it, out of an apprehension of reviuing his Fathers affliction by so sadd an object. This vnfortunate Youth fell to the share of one of Pacorus's Favourits, whose Servants having stript him of his apparrell, found about his Neck, a Boxe all sett with Diamonds, which contain'd within it the Picture of a beauty more bright than those stones that cover'd it; This Excellence they presented to their Lord, and he esteeming it one, did the like to his Prince, who no sooner sawe the Picture, but he became as movelesse as it,  & continu'd in that extacy, t'ill he broake it to learne who 'twas it represented; but therein he found all about him as ignorant as himselfe, and suspecting their silence proceeded from their knowledge, not their ignorance, he told his Favourite; 'Tis in vaine Labienus 'tis in vaine now to conceale who it is has wounded me, for were hir extractio as farre below my Blood, as hir Beauty is above my adoration: were shee an Enemy aswell to my Nature, as my Flame; nor these, nor as many obstacles as shee has charmes; shall deterr me from my Passion, whose greatnesse none can condemne without declaring himselfe asmuch an Enemy to Reason, as to Pacorus; doe not therefore add so much to the affliction of my Love, as to conceale who has inspir'd it, for though I should never learne who is my Conqueror, yet I must alwayes give hir that Name, and carry the effects of hir power; though I should never behold the Possessor of it. All that heard these extravagancyes, were perfectly ignorant of hir Name which created them, but one of those who had shar'd in the rifleing of Crassolis's Sonne, after his Companions were gone, found some weake symtomes of Life in him, and either out of charity or avarice, endeavour'd to preserve what he thought was not absolutly hopelesse; towards which he had caus'd his Prisoner, and Patient, to be transported into his Tent, and being by profession a Chirurgion, had so well practic'd his Arte, that young Crassolis began to open his Eyes, & at last to recover his sences; but the first thing he did when they were restor'd, was to search for his Picture, which he no sooner mist, than he began to teare his wounds, to open a passage for a Soule which detested its dwelling after (and seem'd to sympathize in) so sensible a losse. This strange extravagancy, made the only witnesse of it enquire the cause, which he had no sooner learnt, than he told him, how the richnesse of the Case, had perhapps made him lose what it contain'd, but if he would be contented with the Picture, he would endeavour the restitution. Alas (said the young Crassolis) the Picture is all I desire, and to invite you to restore it, I doe faithfully enguadge my selfe to give you as many Diamonds as can be pil'd upon it. This large reward made him to whome it was offer'd, flye to his Companion to acquaint him with it, who he found about Pacorus, when he was in the torment of so vnhappy an ignorance, which the Chirurgion perceiving and deploring, punctualy acquainted him with all he knew, which immediately when the Prince had learnt, bidding his Threasurer give him higher Rewards, than the Prisoner could be Master of, he commanded him to conduct him to his dying Ryvall, whither they were no sooner come, than the wounded Gentleman hastily askt for the satisfaction of his hopes, but Pacorus permitted not his Guide to reply, and enjoyn'd all which were present to retire, & then presenting himselfe with much civility to the Picture, begg'd him to tell him if he knew whose it was? oh Gods (said the young Crassolis) 'tis mine; & were but my health as good as my title, who ever you are, you should lose it, or I would my life. Truly (said Pacorus) I place as high a value on this excellent Coppy, as you are capable to doe, and would not be depriv'd of it at a lower price, but that you may know I esteeme and doe not hate my Ryvalls (for then I should all Men) I will informe you, my name is Pacorus, and that I have both force and authority to punnish your threatnings, did not I excuse them upon the same accompt, which I hope you will, my detention of both our Conquerours. Ah Sir (said the Prisoner) if you deprive me of my Picture and not of my Life, you are as cruell in the latter, as in the former, and wilbe as severe in your mercy, as in your injustice; for you must permitt me so to call your making that Excellence your Prisoner. Alas 'tis I (said Pacorus) that am hirs. If you were, (reply'd the other) you would not be hir Beseiger. oh Gods! (said the Prince, somwhat surpriz'd) is shee then within Tygranocerta?  & have they made me so miserable a Creature as to endeavour to destroy what I should and doe adore? No (continu'd Pacorus, lifting up his Eyes & hands) I invoke the higher powers to manifest theirs in my confusion, if the faire object of my Flame be within those Walls, if ever I shedd any Blood neere them but for their defence. Great Gods! (the Prisoner cry'd out) could I beleive this profession, how happy were my ruine, & how full of satisfaction my death, if it might contribute to the preservation of a Beauty, whose perfections and cruelty, cannot transcend my Passion. Yes (said the Prince, falling upon his knees) I doe here repeate my former protestation, and implore the Gods to fill this Excellency as full of Ice as shee has me with Fire, and to make me hated asmuch as I doe love, if I doe not consider my Father as my Enemy, if he continue hirs, & leave him no way to act his revenge but thorough his Sonne. I beleive you (Sir) I beleive you, (said the wounded Gentleman, kissing Pacorus hands for joy) since to doubt so strange a change, were to doubt hir power that causes it, who has evinc't upon me in particuler that it is asmuch above being limitted, as resisted; for shee has inspir'd me with a Passion without hope, the greatest Miracle but that which created it. I know (said the impatient Pacorus interrupting him) what hir Beauty is, more by the effects than I can by the description. I will tell you (the other reply'd) that the Goddesse of it is the Princesse Altezeera, and though I looke upon hir as my future Queene, yet I finde shee has a greater Soveraignty over me by hir Eyes, than hir Birth, & I relent more despaire from the greatnesse of hir perfections, than from that of hir quality. This confession, nothing but a certainty of Death could have disclos'd, & if I should be so miserable, as to be mistaken in my conjecture, I am certaine I shall not be in my resolution, which will prove constant enough to punnish the discovery of a secret, which neither the tortures of a fruitlesse Love, nor Flames as great as my presumption, has, or could extort from me. Yes (Sir) I will tell you my short and vnfortunate Story, I sawe the Princesse Altezeera and consequently ador'd hir, but with a silence as great as my Passion; the height of my Aspiring was to languish, and consume in that devotion, and because I suspected my Eyes might discover my heart, or my actions what I knew my words should not, having some skill in Limning, by a thousand stolen opportunities, and by an Idaea which was allwayes present, I drew his Picture, whose Eyes being disarm'd of their light by these faint colours, omitted me to contemplate without dazling, what I could not in the divine Originall. This is my highest cryme, and so much I adore what I love, that I shall esteeme hirs the highest Mercy if shee pardons it; But (Sir) if ever the Gods so blesse your flame, as to make the Princesse Altezeera the reward of it, & that your discourses lead you to remember the occasion which made you first a Lover, doe not mention my vnfortunate fire, with that scorne the ambition of it merits, but with some resentment of that voluntary death I have embrac't out of a sence of my presumption; Let the remembrance too, of that safety it will give hir, and of that bessing it will for you be instrumentall in, extinguish a fault, for which I extinguish my Life, & though I am your Ryvall, yet the way in which I am so, being a sufficient punnishment for having bin so. The poore Gentleman was able to proceed no further, for either the enlarging his wounds upon the losse of Altezeera's Picture: the despaire of repossessing it: the apprehension of out-living the discovery of his Passion: or the joy of his Death being like to prove the preservation of his Princesses Life; cast him into a swoon'd, from which, all Pacorus's helpe, nor the Chirurgions, could recall him any longer than to begg the Prince not to fight against his Conqueror; which he had no sooner said than an eternall silence clos'd up his lipps. Pacorus was so generous as to celebrate his Death with some Teares  & Sighes, excusing his cryme by the knowledge of what created it, which by experiment he found was of a quality, that to avoyd was farre more difficult than to immitate; but the last summons of his dead Ryvall, made him immediatly goe into his Fathers Campe, where finding him busie about his approaches, and all the Assistants with drawing themselves out of respect, he told Arsaces, after some other common discourses; Would it had pleas'd the Gods (Sir) to have given you an employment more suitable to your Inclination and qualitie than this you are now upon, for you only labour for that which is already effected, & cannot be more succesfull than you are, without rendring your selfe lesse worthy of it; Your Sword (Sir) has made Artabazus confesse he is vanquisht, let not therefore his ruine doe it; If he makes any resistance, 'tis you give him that power, and by giving him despaire you give him resolution; you have conquer'd him already by force, doe it againe by humanity, make a King your Freind by declining making him your vassall: to conquer your selfe is a greater victory than to conquer one you have already conquer'd; and the Romans hereby will apprehend a power, that has vanquisht both Arsaces, and Artabazus, together. I will not (said Falintus) tell you all Pacorus reasons, since they appear'd none to his Father, who esteem'd the best advantage of a victory, was, to win, & not meritt a Kingdome; and indeed that violent Prince was so farre from pardoning his Enemyes, that he almost reckon'd Pacorus in their Number for making so mercifull a proposall. In the horrors of this deniall he return'd to his Tent, where after he had spent an houre in the highest disorders that ever man was capable of, on a sudden his Face assumed a loy which Labienus (who only was present) knew not unto what to ascribe it; but it sprung from a cause which rais'd Gallantry to a height it never knew before; and if Altezeera's constancy could have bin capable of excuse, this performance had bin a sufficient one, for hir new Lover, finding Arsaces vnremovable, by his having given him a flatt refusall of what he even begg'd with Teares, which till then he never had, That generous Prince, the night before a generall Assault was to be given, the Breach being wide enough, and wanting hands to defend it, accompany'd only by Labienus (his Confident) as if he went to view it, came into Tygranocerta by it, and having deliver'd himselfe up to the Guards, desir'd them to bring him to the Princesse Altezeera, to whome he said he had some affaires of singular importance to impart; The Captaine which commanded the Post immediatly brought him to the Palace, where the Princesse (who then was with hir Brother at their devotions, expecting never to see another Night, but an eternall one) being inform'd that a Gentleman of Quality (which both his Meene and Cloathes spoake him) was stolne from the Campe to give hir an Intelligence, came into a great Hall to receive it, but as soone as shee appear'd, the poore Pacorus found how short Arte had bin of Nature, and that if he had had cause to love the Picture, he had more to adore and admire the Originall; Though some few dayes before, either an indisposition, or some other Melancholly had cast hir into a feaver, which but then shee had gott out of; but there is a beauty in Lillies aswell as in Roses, & that little palenesse did but better sett off the blacknesse of hir Eyes, which shott so pierceing, & bright a Flame into the trembling Parthians heart, that his silence, and disorder gave the faire Altezeera as great an astonishment, as hir Beauty had him. But his, being somwhat dissipated, he esteem'd the making an appologie for that fault, was a greater than he had comitted, since his offence was of a quality which carry'd its justification with it; therefore with asmuch grace as humility he only told Altezeera, Madam, He which has employ'd a parte of his Life against you, presents unto you all of it, & will esteeme your Pardon a Cruelty if you preserve his but to employ it perpetually in your service, Yes Madam, you have now in your Power the crimminall Pacorus who oppos'd your Brothers Armes, but he neither had the power nor the desire to resist yours, to which he renders his minde asmuch a Prisoner, as his Body, Iudge then (faire Princesse) of the authority of my Conqueror, who extends hir power over that which is immateriall, and has no existence but in speculation; Punish (Madam) Arsaces cruelty in Arsaces Sonne, or if what I have done induces you to believe, though I am ally'd to him, yet I am not to his Crymes; shew it I beseech you by commanding me to oppose him at the Breatch, that if he enter, it may be through me, and so necessitate him to a Victory, he must celebrate in Teares, aswell as Blood; My life which has bin so often employ'd against you, cannot expiate that Sinn, but by being sacrific'd for you, however, you have now wherewithall to make (or rather to impose) your conditions on Orodes, who perhaps had rather lose Armenia, than Pacorus. oh Gods! (continu'd Falintus) is it possible to tell you the faire Altezeera's wonder and surprize, all the while the Prince of Parthia was speaking? No noe, it is not, for were it describable, it would be lesse than it was, but left he might forme some strange beleife of hir perplexities and silence, shee told him. Whatsoever (Sir) you ascribe your coming hither vnto, I must not to your submission, but to your power, which is more evinc't by entring this Citty alone, than with an Army, or else perhapps 'tis to increase the Ardour of yours by joyning the liberty of their Prince, to the winning of Tygranocerta. Ah Madam (said Pacorus) I have so lost my liberty, that it lyes as litle in my Armyes power, as in my owne will to recover it, and if I have flung my selfe within these walls, 'twas rather to deterre the Parthians from entring them, than to incite them to it, You raigne too absolutly in my heart, not to know this Truth, & if you desire I should dye fighting against Arsaces, 'tis rather to satisfy your revenge than your doubts; but if I am so vnfortunate, as not to fall in your defence, you have still wherewith to act your revenge; Your Beauty gives you asmuch the power, as my past crimes gives you the justice. Since said Altezeera you will have me beleive you are come to preserve those you have hitherto endeavour'd to destroy, I will doe it; but it proceeds more from my obedience than my Reason, though I must acknowledge, I have had so high a Carracter of the Prince Pacorus Gallantry, that I should have thought him capable of all but this which he has now acted, and which is of a Nature, that to suspect 'tis too-great to be true, is to oblige it when it proves so. Madam (the Prince reply'd) if you suspect my professions but to invite me to evince their reallities by my actions, you will asmuch oblige me upon that scoare, as injure me if your doubts proceed from any other. Whilst the Princesse and Pacorus were thus discoursing, Labienus was brought to Artabazus, to whome he told his Princes story, and how by giving him Altezeera he had not only wherewith to save his Crowne for the present, but to secure it in the future. The King at so vnpresidented an accident, was cast into Admirations, as great as his feares, but having reflected a while both on the virtue of Pacorus's performance, and on the advantage of his allyance; he gave Labienus an answer which gave him large hopes; for he was concern'd in his Princes felicity, and by having seene Altezeera he found his passion was as comendable, as great; but Artabazus esteeming it high tyme to visit his voluntary Prisoner went with Labienus to him, & found, his person was as handsome, as his Action. There Pacorus by reitterated, and passionate expressions, implor'd a Pardon for a Cryme which his ignorance made him comitt, and which his knowledge did sufficiently revenge. 'Twas in discourses of that quality they spent the residue of the Night, and the day no sooner appear'd, than Arsaces Army storm'd the Breatch, & thereby gave so hott an Allarme, that it came to his Sonnes heareing, who hastily told Altezeera That Life (Madam) which has bin employ'd against you, shall now serue to preserve you, or else shalbe lost for having bin too-active, and too-impotent, farewell faire Altezeera, you shall finde I will shedd my blood for you, with greater confidence, than I dare tell you so. Then saluteing the King with much humility, but his sister with much more, he putt onn his Hellmet, & follow'd by Labienus and some Armenians, he rann where the noyse, & danger call'd him, which was indeed great, & had not his Courage & Fortune bin so too, wee had lost Tygranocerta, and he his Life; but though he perform'd things as worthy wonder, as relation, yet all had bin fruitelesse, had he not by lifting up his Hellmet, & telling his Name, struck such a reverence and dampe into the Parthians, that they made a generall stand in the way of victory, and suspended their bloody Armes in the Ayre; which Pacorus observeing, though his wounds were many, & dangerous; yet leaneing on his Sword in the Mouth of the Breatch, he forc'd himselfe to tell them; These wounds valiant Parchians, which I have hitherto receiu'd, carry your excuse, in your ignorance, but those you hereafter give me, must be sinns of designe and consequently peirce me deeper, than your Swords; neither can you avoyde this Cryme, but by retireing to your Campe, for whoever makes his passage into Tygranocerta, must doe it thorough his Prince, who commands you by that duty you owe him, & which he will abundantly reward, to returne to Arsaces, and to let him knowe, that by becomeing an Enemy to the Princesse Altezeera, he has made Pacorus his; That if he vallues his Sonnes safety, he must demonstrate it by his care of hirs; which if by a repeated Assault he endeavours to endanger, I will drawe my Army in for to maintaine it, & esteeme the crmie of opposeing my King, & my Father, a lesser than his, which necessitates me to it; and if at last I have not force to resist his, I will not want it to ende a Life upon a Breatch, which it was so vnfortunate as not to defend. Doe not beleive (he continu'd) that this declaration is dictated by heate, or passion, no, it proceeds from a just, and digested resolution, & if either Arsaces, or you doe doubt the contrary, and that these wounds doe not sufficiently manifest this Truth, I will by so bloody an experiment convince both him, and you of it, that perhapps your greifes shalbe as large as your doubts. These words spoake with grace and vehemency, and the great respect all the Parthians pay'd Pacorus, wrought a proportionate effect; many were willing to obey his Comands, others which knew his disposition, apprehended to prosecute a victory which could not succeed without loseing more than they could win in it, and some who thought to have seene their Prince at the head of their Troopes killing the Armenians, were so surpriz'd to finde him at the head of his Enemyes, killing his, Servants that their wonder made them obedient,  & observeing Pacorus Army had not storm'd, cotrary to their orders (for I omitted to tell you, he had given them expresse command not to drawe out of their Campe, whatsoever they heard 'till they did so, either from himselfe, or Labienus) they began to suspect there was some intricacy in the businesse, which their prosecuting any further might discover to their ruine, or their Princes's; all these inducements & (as the Gods would have it) one Rysolis, (Pacorus Creature) commanding these Troopes were the causes that they began by degree's to retire with severall tones of murmurings, which sufficietly manifested their retreate proceeded from divers apprehensions. But the Enemy had no sooner abandon'd the Breatch, than the Prince by the losse of a deluge of Blood, swoonded in Labienus Armes, who by the assistance of some Souldiers which had defended it, was carry'd to the Pallace and lodg'd in a magnificent Appartment, Artabazus had provided for him, and where, by force of Cordialls he was restor'd to that Life, which but seemingly had left him. His sences were no sooner return'd, than the cheifest of them was entertain'd by the faire Altezeera, who Artabazus had brought with him to acknowledge, and reward that Gallantry, which had bin so advantagious to them both. After the King had made his retributions, he withdrew himselfe to the other side of the Chamber, to resigne his place to the Princesse, who Pacorus no sooner sawe, than he fell into tremblings and confusions, which better exprest his acknowledgements than his words could; but Altezeera esteemeing his performances meritted more than a silent visit, told him. You have Sir, endanger'd your Life to preserve your Enemyes, and by that demonstration of your virtue wee finde our safetyes purchast at a rate, which makes us esteeme them a greater misfortune, than our ruines could have prov'd. Alas Madam (said Pacorus) you more endanger my Life by giveing those I have faught for that Name, than those have done which I faught against, and were there any merit in my duty, 'tis too-aboundantly rewarded by your saying there is, and by a visit, which I would perpetualy implore by repeateing greater dangers, and greater wounds; but alas Madam, can you so soone pardon a declaration I made, when I thought I should repaire it by my death, which before now I had acted, did not I finde my Life would at lest contribute asmuch to your safety, as the losse of it could to your revenge; but Madam I told you a Truth which was of a quality which told it selfe, and my words did acquaint you but with that, which every perfection about you does, so that what I presum'd to mention, was as nedlesse, as presumptuous. Altezeera, (who extreamly disrelisht entertainments of this sorte) reply'd If my expressions (Sir) have not acquainted you with my gratitude, I beleive my suffering of these discourses will, but I give them to your actions, & condition, & will in the future acknowledge your abstaining from them as great a favour, as any you have, done or are capable to doe unto me. Ah Madam (said Pacorus, after a litle silence, and some sighes) why doe you inspire me with so much passion & command me to conceale it, & why doe you take from me the power of obedience, & yet enjoyne me it; would to the Gods you had comanded me to suppresse my Life insteed of my Words, you should have seen by an instant experiment, that I preferr nothing before the honor of obeying you, & in that performance be convinc't, if I am disobedient to your first Comands, 'tis because I am vncapable, and not vnwilling to be otherwise: Yes faire Princesse, 'tis as impossible for me not to tell you that I adore you, as 'tis not to doe it, my Passion would be lesse, could my obedience be greater, I can therefore hardly condemne a fault which justifies so glorious a Truth; but if the faire Altezeera does, that Arme which has oppos'd hir Enemyes, shall execute one of them, and forgett the interests of his Master, to satisfy those of his Conqueror. I render (Madam) my intentions as visible as my Flame, that you may either permitt the latter, or punish the former; were you a Beauty which needed tyme to evince the reallity of my Passion, or which perseverance and services might give me a title to, I should use that dull method; but since your perfections doe not only manifest the former, but suppresse all hopes of the latter, I have the first minute of adoreing you, as great a Title to my Felicity, as I can have the last, so that the object of my Flame being different from all others, the wayes of my addresses must be so too; & the refuseing me that blessing now, is to assure me you will eternally doe it, since there can never be any thing in me to induce it; therefore Madam resolutly pronounce my sentence, for next liveing in your favour, the greatest felicity is, dying by your Commands, which latter I protest, by the Princesse Altezeera I will performe; but yet Madam, doe not thinke I will, to pay you one duty, decline another, & deprive you of my service, whilst it is so blest as to be usefull to you; No before he which adores you shall fall your sacrifice, he will make many others doe so which fight against you, & will never elect his owne quiett 'till he has establisht you in yours; for your suppressing my hopes, shall not my duty, and to serve you for any reward but the Honor of serving you, were to deserve none. Altezeera was extreamly perplext at this vow, and judgeing of his resolution by the violence in which he vtter'd it, shee reply'd; Your willfulnesse (Sir) reduces me to strange extremities, either to suffer your cryme, or to suffer by it, but beleive me if I should elect the first, I must vnavoydably the last. Ah Madam (Pacorus cry'd out) had the Gods any way but this to make me miserable whilst you permitted me to adore you? No faire Altezeera: I will dye sooner than live at this rate, and did not my duty enjoyne me this election, my gratitude would; I will Madam no more hope to raise my felicity, since it must be by your sufferings, I will languish out this sadd Life 'till it may be no longer vsefull to you, and when it cannot serve, it shall not trouble you. Pacorus spoake these words so distinctly that Artabazus rann to his Bedd-side to learne their cause, but the Prince had too settl'd thoughts of Death to disclose any thing which might prevent it, & Altezeera was too-much offended & troubl'd, to discover the occasion of either; but though the King could not learne the reason of this disorder, yet he immagin'd it, and in that Faith drew the Princesse aside, where whilst he was infusing Gratitude, if not Love into hir, some of Pacorus Domesticks came in, who having vnderstood their Princes condition, had abandon'd the Campe to come and pay him their Duties. 'Twas by them he was inform'd (at the Parthians returne to Arsaces Campe, and at their telling him the cause of their not taking Tygranocerta) that Orodes had assum'd the highest fury that ever Man was capable of: that he had call'd him Rebell, Traytor, & all those injuries which a violent Rage is aptest to dictate: that he had protested he was more troubl'd for his Sonnes cryme, than for that victory it hinder'd: that he hated him asmuch as he had lov'd him: that he would have Sacrific'd all those which had obey'd Pacorus, had not they vow'd to Sacrifice themselves or redeeme him from his voluntary restraint: and that the next Night they intended to repeate the assault. This newes more perplext Artabazus than either Altezeera or Pacorus, who knowing his Father was vnresistable in his Fury, immediatly told Artabazus; I know (Sir) Arsaces will make use of Force, and therefore I will; he has an Army to assault you, and I shall not want one to defend you; neither can that Army which has reduc't you to this condition, better repaire that Sinn, than to free you from it; 'tis therefore with your permission I will send Labienus to my Campe, that if Orodes does attempt his Threatnings, I may have wherewithall to make them still beare but that name; My Army (Sir) cannot be more gloriously employ'd than to preserve a perfection as high as the Sinn that would destroy it, and from hindering their King from being vnjust, and barbarous; For the Faith of those I shall draw into Tygranocerta, I will enguage Mine; and that they shall continue within these Walls, but to obey you, and to defend them. I cannot tell you what operation this gallantry had with Artabazus, who only exprest it by a Thousand embraces; but the Princesse Altezeera, was so mov'd with it that before shee left the Chamber shee told Pacorus, If you doe not beleive your Life is considerable to me, you doe me as great an injury, as an obligation if you preserve it. Madam (said the Prince (taking the confidence to kisse hir hand, on which he printed his burning Lipps) I will preserve my Life, 'till I know my Death wilbe a greater Duty. Whilst Labienus was preparing things in his Princes Campe which lay on the West-side of the River Nicephorus, Arsaces was the next Night preparing to assault Tygranocerta, yet with intention, that so much of it should be spent, as the light of Day might see his victory; He chose to begin the assault during the obsenrity to avoyd the Enemyes darts, and Arrowes, before they came to the Breach, and lest the sight of Pacorus might produce a resembling effect to the precedent. At the houre assign'd the Arsacian Parthians began the Storme, & no sooner did the Allarme reach Labienus than he enter'd Tygranocerta with 10000 of the same Nation, but of a different Party. The Assaliants admir'd to finde the Breach so well defended, and the Defendants that they durst assault it, but the Day no sooner appear'd than the Stormers wonder ceas'd by another, & by their Greifes; the first, to finde that those which should have contributed to their victory oppos'd it, and the last, to finde, theirs must be wonne of their Countrymen to be wonne of their Enemyes, these and many other motives too large to be deduced, by a motion of Labienus's, and by the hazard, and cryme of the attempt, made the Arsacians condescend to returne from the assault of Tygranocerta, so the Pacorians would from the defence of it; which compact being concluded, was immediatly perform'd, for Pacorus (to suppresse what ever jealousies Artabazus might have) comanded Labienus to retire to his Campe, & not move from thence, but upon a resembling cause to that which had drewne him from it; & truely that generous Prince seem'd to be greiv'd at nothing in his Souldiers successe, but his having had no share in it. During this fight about the Towne, there was another in the Campe, for Arsaces vnderstanding of what Labienus had done by his Princes Commands, martch'd out of his owne Campe with 20000 Men, to his Sonnes (over the Bridge of Boates, which Labienus vnfortnatly had not broaken) to keepe those in awe by his Forces, which his presence & Authority could not; but Pacorus was so passionatly lov'd by his Army, that though Arsaces raign'd over, yet Hee did in them, so that they all oppos'd the Arsacians, as if they had bin Armenians, and if the Gods had not protected Orodes person, he cast himselfe into so many dangers that that obedience his Sonnes Army pay'd him by Affection, they must have by duty. Bnt though the King had assum'd an inordinate rage, yet he had not so absolutely resign'd all his faculties, to it but upon the approach of Labienus, and his Forces, who were then returning to their Campe, Arsaces who beleiv'd they came victorious from the assault, and would prove so in the releife of their Companions, sounded a retreate, and having drawn up his Army, neere the Bridge and secur'd it, sent a Trumpet to command Labienus to come to him, and an enguadgement for his safe returne; Labienus satisfy'd with the latter, obeyes the former, and in words (the most moveing he could invent) implor'd him to pardon and settle a Passion whose greatnesse he might judge by the effects, and whose Iustice he could not but be satisfy'd with, when he sawe the Beauty which created it; that he could not destroy his Sonnes Love without his Life, that therefore his Revenge on his Enemyes would prove theirs on him, and that by a marriage he might save Pacorus & possesse Armenia, (for then the news was brought of Tygranes Death) But Arsaces who sent for him only to know the cause of his retreate to the Campe, and to command his continuance in it, having learnt that 'twas by a mutuall agreement and not by a repulse that the Arsacians were return'd, more troubl'd at the first cause of it, than he could be at the last, proclaimes immediatly Labienus (and all those which should assist Pacorus) Traytors; but finding by what they had done, what they might doe, he left Phraates, Surena, and Vixores, with all those Forces he had brought with him to hinder Labienus releiving Pacorus, in case he should attempt it, and flying to his owne Campe, he drew all his Souldiers out of it, & by few but sharpe words condemn'd their remissnesse, & call'd that their Feares which they palliated with the name of a tendernesse of shedding their Companions bloood: that if this opinion was misplac't on them, they had an opportunity now to evince it, since he had brought Labienus to obey him by duty or by force, & they had now only to oppose those Armenians who could no longer continue their preservation, without as high a dishonor to the Parthians, as advantage to themselves; in breife, he so fully remov'd all their scruples, & so incited their valours, by injuries, and promises of Reward, that the Souldiers by a precipitate Martch, went to repeate the assault. oh Gods! what a confusion did this 'Allarme raise in the Armenians, who found their expected Ruine the more bitter, by their late confidence of having absolutely avoyded it; but this sadd newes no sooner came to Artabazus knowledge, than he rann transported to Pacorus Chamber to acquaint him with it; The generous Parthian at this fatall Intelligence, did Labienus and himselfe so much wrong as to suspect his Fidelity, but learning that the Campe was in as great disorder as the Towne, he condemn'd himselfe for having condemn'd his Favourite, and finding all things desperate in spight of Artabazus and his Chyrurgions intreaties, he hastily put onn his Cloathes, & comanded some of his Domesticks to carry him in a Chaire to the Breach, whither as he was goeing, he mett the Princesse Altezeera, at whose Feete (causeing his men to stay) he prostrated himselfe, all pale, and bloody, (for by the violence of his fury & motion, some of his wounds fell fresh a bleeding) and having a while embrac'd hir Knees, he told hir, Cann you yet (Madam) have so much goodnesse left, for one whose Father endeavours your destruction, as to permitt him to speake to, & see you? this is an vndenyable proofe you know and possesse my heart, for if that were not legible, you might justly make me a sacrifice to your Revenge, and not permitt me the honor of dying one for your safety. I goe (faire Princesse) to fall for your preservation if I cannot obtaine it; and you shall never see this offender againe, vnlesse by his services he effaces some of his offences, if Arsaces doe deprive me of that generous Ambition, I will deprive him of his Sonne, and if I now finde my Fate, all that I implore is, that the way in which I receive it, may expiate the Sinn of the Fathers Cruelty, and the presumption of the Sonnes Passion. These words, with the posture he was in, so peirc't the Princesse Heart, which was capable of all impressions so neere ally'd to virtue, as Pitty, that shee demonstrated hirs, by some Teares shee could not possibly restraine, which Pacorus observeing, he continu'd; You weepe faire Princesse, I will goe and drye your Teares, by makeing those which cause them, to weepe Teares of blood, or not live to see and participate in your sorrow. Then with a trembling respect, taking the Princesses hand, which hir confusion made hir not oppose, he printed on it such passionate  & ardent kisses, that those which sawe them, thought his Soule would sooner come out of his Mouth, than his wounds; in this extacy he had longer continu'd, had not a great crye awaken'd him out of it, and calld him from pleasure to danger, whither he went with Teares, not for the latter, but for abandoning as he thought eternally the former. As soone as he came to the Breach (which by the industry of some defendants had bin a little repair'd) he caus'd himselfe to be sett in the mouth of it, where danger as great as his resolution, threatned him, and where he found that shoute he had heard, proceeded from the Armenians at the arrivall of Phanasder, who heareing the danger Tygranocerta was in, causd himselfe to be carry'd where 'twas most visible, esteeming it a nobler destiny to dye in the Bedd of Honor, than in that of sicknesse; I follow'd him immediatly with the same resolution, and in a resembling posture, & came tyme enough to see Pacorus with his Sword threaten the conquerors, who no sooner sawe their Prince in so sadd and generous a Posture, than by degrees those Cloudes of Darts and Arrowes began to diminish, and at length ceas't; as soone as the noyse was so, Pacorus with more eloquence than I thought a Man in his disorder was capable of, so mou'd the Parthians hearts, and affections, that in the ende, concludeing with a reitterated & deepe vowe when he could no longer defend the Breach, he would Kill himselfe in it, and that he was confident if they would retire, either to restore his Father to his former affection in few dayes, or himselfe to his Duty, they begann by litle and litle to drawe off, which when they were entirely, Pacorus told Phanasder and me, that he never had a higher Duty than that which he pay'd Altezeera, and that he only mention'd that word, to reduce the Parthians to theirs, and to protract the Tyme 'till he could drawe in Labienus and some Forces. Whilst we were in the admiration of this generous Prince, and upon our returne the Centinells upon the highest Towres gave us a fresh Allarme, which we found was no false one, for we immediatly perceiv'd the Parthian Ensignes flying towards us, and the foremost of them carry'd by one who Pacorus at last knew to be Arsaces, who seeing his Souldiers retreate, & learning the occasion of it, in that fury both inspir'd, he rann to the Ensigne of the first Milliary, & having forc't it from him, he cry'd out to the rest, I told you degrenerate Parthians, 'twas your feare you disguis'd vnder a false Name, for now that you faught for Glory and against your Enemyes, you resigne the first to the last, in which number I include the false Pacorus, who is a Traytor to his King, and to his Father, and whose sight should rather inspire you with revenge, than respect; you fight not against your Prince, but his Crimes, which being great enough to make me divest my selfe of all the dictates of Nature, may well invite you to cast off those of Respect; neither can you avoyde punishing his Sinn, but by committing a greater; Remember, from your Prince he is become your Enemy, & that in takeing Tygranocerta you subdue a Kingdome, & a Rebell who is much more considerable; neither will I comand you to act what I will decline, doe but followe your King, destroy you the Armenians, & I will Pacorus, let us goe then valiant Parthians, by your performances merit that Title, which the more to induce you to, I vowe by the Gods I will finde in this assault my satisfaction, or my Death; Finishing these words he martch't at the head of his Troopes, & through a storme of Arrowes which were shott before Pacorus knew his Father, he came to the Foote of the Breach, some follow'd him out of duty, some out of feare, but the most (as I have bin since told) to oppose, & divert him if affaires were reduc't to extreames; But the generous Pacorus no sooner knew Orodes, than he commanded the Armenians to forbeare all Hostility for a litle, and that a good conclusion of this difference, or his death should render his orders vselesse, or dispence with their infringement of them; this being obey'd, he raises himselfe up; and leaneing on his Sword he cry'd out, Arsaces, cruell Arsaces, here is that Sonne which thou prosecutest more than Armenia, retire thy Forces out of the latter, and I will deliver thee up the former, and if thy fury has not so entirely divested thee of Nature as to become the executioner of thy Sonne, be will in recompence become his owne, & thereby evince himselfe thine, since nothing but so neere an allyance could induce him by Death, to exempt thee from what if acted, will make thee deserve it. There is Divinity Arsaces within these Walls, & if thou esteems't my saying so, noe Truth, thou wile change thy opinion, if thou reflectest on what hir defence has made me vndertake, & what reverence thy Souldiers have pay'd hir Defendor, or if both these will not invite thee to that beleife, the seeing of hir, will; but if nothing can move thee to reason, or pitty, I attest that perfection I Adore, and which thou comit'st a Sinn if thou dost not, that the first stepp thou maks't towards hir destruction, I will act myne, and perhaps when thy choller has resign'd what it has vsurp't over thy reason, thou wilt finde some, in deploreing a Sonne, who thou didst once honor with thy affection, and who has lost it in a performance which hereafter (but when 'tis too-late) thou wilt confesse has given him a better Title to it. Whilst Pacorus was thus speakeing all the Parthians (as their King) did make a stand, and in immitation of the Armenians, had desisted from shooteing, with Lookes in which a small Phisiognomist might have read their Hopes of not doeing it againe, and in a silent eloquence seem'd to implore that command from Arsaces, whose answer they expected, and heard with impatience, for it was thus; Traytor & degenerat Pacorus, who to aggravate thy Crymes, canst mention the name of Sonne, & yet be in Armes & Rebellion against me; know, that the same moment thou hast cast off the duty of a Sonne, I have divested my selfe of the relation of a Father, and consequently that Death thou threatnest me with, loses that operation with me, which thou act'st, I shall in parte excuse the Sinns of the Life, and consider it rather as an effect of the greatnesse of their horror, than of thy affection! Neither can I commit any higher Cryme than to pardon thine, for thou hast robb'd me in one action, of a Sonne, of Glory, and of Quitet, which two last I must and will restore, by the destruction of the first; for that Divinity thou mention'st, I am confident shee is none, were it only for inviting thee to Sinn; but if shee be one, let hir shew it in hir defence, for I am determin'd on so vigorous an Assault, that nothing but a Divinity can render it vnsuccessefull; Then turning to the Parthians with a surious Looke, he commanded them to follow him, and began in a hasty martch to ascend the Breatch, but he was stoppt by Pacorus, who cry'd out, Stay Arsaces, stay, since thou art so greedy of my Death, behold I will act it, & if the takeing out of the World him that robbd thee of a Sonne, of Glory, & of Quiett; & if he that restores thee to the latter two, can merit any favour from thee; I conjure thee by those obligations which I will immediatly conferre on thee, content thy selfe with the Submission, and seeke not the Ruine of Artabazus, or if thy rage has stopt all wayes to mercy for him, yet at least, let his excellent Sister be respected as neere as you can extend your Duties to hir merit; I conjure thee once againe by the name of Father, by the name of King, by this blood I shedd for thy satisfaction, & by my last breath, graunt me this request. Then with a looke which entirely relisht of Death, turning the Pommell of his Sword to the ground, and the Poynt to his Brest, he said, farewell eternally faire Princesse, I am capable of no more but to live your Adorer, and to dye your Martyr, and then cast himselfe so suddenly on the fatall Steelle, that though some endeavour'd to prevent it, yet they could not so absolutely, but that he made a large wound in his left side, and fell on the ground, weltering in a Sea of Blood; which the Parthians no sooner observ'd at the foote of the Breach, than in that rage the losse of their Prince inspir'd, they were goeing to increace it by that of their King, who was so struck with Pacorus last words, and actions, that it dispell'd all his fury, which had no sooner resign'd its place to greife, Reason, and Nature, than in those dictates they inspir'd, without considering the mutiny of his owne Souldiers, or the danger of the Armenian, he clamber'd up the Breach, and cast himselfe on the pale, & Bloody Body of his generous Sonne, and by Teares, & a Million of as pregnant Testimonyes of his conversion, acquainted Pacorus with it, so tymely too, that the lest delay had render'd his change as fruitlesse, as 'twas reall; for Pacorus finding after the Amazement of his Fall, that he was prevented of his intent, drew out a conceal'd Ponnyard, which he was goeing to sheath in his Heart, had not Orodes by molifying his owne, preserv'd his Sonnes. Great Gods! (continu'd Falincus) could I tell you those changes which then happen'd, which were as great as sudden, I might fill you with that wonder which did all that were present, and truly when you consider this mutation, the more you doe it, the stranger you will finde it, The Father & the Sonne came to take Tygranocerta, the first, in steed of winning the Towne, looses both it, and his Sonne; And the last both his Father and his Liberty, and yet commands where he has lost it. Artabazus & Altezeera finde their Protector in their Enemy; Arsaces loses his Army because he will lose his Sonne, yet at last findes his satisfaction in their disobedience; Pacorus does the like, & learnes this truth from thence, that Affection is a stronger tye upon Souldiers, than Duty, and the vnhappinesse that all the Parthians lov'd another, better than their King; He findes Death the way to Life, & Danger to safety. Th' Armenians who did feare to see Orodes within their Walls, see it now without any, and that Breach they intended he should never enter but by their Deaths, they see him doe it with satisfaction. Arsaces who had the Armenians at his Mercy, findes himselfe at theirs, & findes himselfe so without any apprehension, but for the Death of him whose Life was so lately his greatest. The Breach which was the scene of the generall dispute, is now of the reconciliation, and if the Armenians and Parthians had any desires, they were mutuall for Pacorus recovery, and against Arsaces relapse. So strange an alteration drew Artabazus & Altezeera thither, whose presence contributed more to the generous Patients recovery, than the Chirurgions Arte, by which neverthelesse they assur'd the impatient Kings if no newe accesse happen'd, they would restore him to that health, he had so meritoriously lost. There 'twas that Arsaces sawe Altezeera, and by that Sight, what Nature had pardon'd in his Sonne, then Reason did; 'Twas thought a while by Orodes silence, and first contemplation, that the influence of the Princesse's Eyes, would have runn in a Blood, but it seemes he was but so farre in the way of Love as Admiration, which he soone left, by the reflection on a Beauty in Parthia, who had so large an ascendant over him, & so just a one too, that his inconstancy could not be more a fault, than a punishment. [These words made the poore Artabbanes by a deepe Sigh acknowledge a Truth which he determin'd eternally to deplore, but his generous freind to make his attention divert his Melancholly, thus continu'd his Relation.] But the calme in Tygranocerta could hardly transcend the storme in Pacorus Campe, which Phraates assaulted with much resolution, and found asmuch in his opposition, but if in that day he gave proofes of a large Courage, he did of as large a Cruelty, shewing all those which submitted to his Mercy, that he had none. The Faithfull Labienus endeavouring to force a passage to the releife of his Prince, almost found his ruine in his Duty, for being peirc't with two Darts, he was at length taken Prisoner, and the cruell Phraates to punish the fidelity of his Life, had given orders to deprive him of it, which was happily prevented by an Expresse from Arsaces, who sent to end those Differences in the Campe, which he had put a period to in the Towne; that being but a consequence of this. The Bloody Phraates receiv'd the command of his being so no longer, and the cause of it, with amazement, repenting he had shed so much blood, only because he could shedd no more, for he esteem'd the difference betweene his Father and his Brother irreconcilable, and by his actions evinc'd that was his Faith, which when he found 'twas an erronious one, he began by a thousand formall contritions to manifest a Repentance, which he neither had nor was capable of, and which he counterfeicted so, that he discover'd he did so. But (continu'd Falintus) the apprehensions I had that Arsaces was guilty of a resembling Cryme, made me propound to Artabazus the detaining of him, now we had the power, which I said, the Gods gave us, to raise in us the Will, This proposall I fortify'd, by never having enguag'd our Faiths for the Contrary; that his change was rather from Passion than virtue; That not being the latter, it would soone expire; That by having him in our hands, we had our safetyes too, and so good a Tye upon the Parthians, that wee might derive it from our selves and not from their Mercy, And, that we had wherewithall upon their retireing to gratify the Sonne, by restoreing the Father. I had too (said Falintus) to my selfe as stronge a reason as all these together which yet I durst not mention (I meane) the apprehension that if Orodes were at liberty, the Princesse Altezeera would be the condition of the Peace, which being inform'd my King was intent upon, though that should the rather have induc'd me to motion it, yet it did to silence it, since it might have render'd me suspected, & that my former allegations were for you, not him. But Artabazus absolutly declin'd this overture, either through feare or virtue, but indeed all his Arguments for his so doeing, relisht of the latter: But (continu'd Falintus) why doe I dwell so long upon this Subject, as if it were to one who were litle enough concearn'd in it to be delighted with it; 'Tis too much that you know, after Arsaces & Pacorus had had some private discourse accompany'd with passionate Gestures, & that the Father had kist and embrac't the Sonne, he tooke Leave of Artabazus and Altezeera, in words which resented of nothing but freindship and Peace, and begg'd the last to give him a good accompt of a Sonne, which he entirely left to hir dispose, & from whome only they both expected his recovery. After these Civilities were finisht, he descended the same way he came up, & was receiv'd with more shoutes from his Army (which attended him at the Foote of the Breach) for leaveing Tygranocerta, than he could have had if he had conquer'd it. Pacorus immediatly after this separation, was commanded by Altezeera to preserve a Life which shee now acknowledg'd shee was more than ordinarily concearn'd in; To which injunction having made his passionate and eloquent retributions, he was carry'd to his Appartment, Artabazus doeing him the honor to goe on Foote by his Litter. But the strong apprehensions Phanasder and I had, that these transcendent obligations, the Power of a King, and Brother, and the generall safety which would as absolutely be hazarded by Altezeeras declineing Pacorus, as settl'd by hir receiveing him, made us joinctly conjure the faire Theoxcena (who was ever publiquely & zealously concern'd in your interest's) to goe visite Altezeera, & by hir perswasions conuert or fortify hir inclinations, which was a Duty our wounds hinder'd us from paying you, & which were more troublesome to us upon that scoare, than any other. The faire Theoxcena by our desires judgeing of our Feares, assum'd them too, & with a hasty earnestnesse, went in hir Charriott immediatly to Altezeera, whose discourses at first were somewhat cold, but at last were so entirely divested of that dull quality, that Theoxcena return'd to us with a Gavity which manifested hir satisfaction, & with assurances that what we had contemplated as Arguments of feare, Altezeera did as evincements of hir Constancy, and that shee reflected with joy on Pacorus obligations, from no other motives, than that Artavasdes might be in them convinc't shee was vncapable of change, since Pacorus's services, Person, & quality, had not that Power. This generous declaratio converted our Feares into nobler Passions, for we were so much concern'd in your satisfaction, that we had rather have hazarded the publique than it. The next Day Regeliza came to visit Theoxcena, where after the first Civilities, shee told hir with a freedome which is not common to Courtiers, That the Princesse Altezeera did not entirely approve hir last sollicitations, what-ever Face shee receiv'd them with, since if Artavasdes were the object of hir Passion, shee desir'd he should continue so without deriving that felicity from any secundary causes; and if he were not, shee might attribute hir visit rather to a sounding hir intentions, than a confirmation of them. This Madam (said Regeliza) the high respects I pay you makes me discover, and I beleive you cannot doubt my heart, since I acquaint you with my Mistrisse's. The virtuous Theoxcena pay'd this Freedome by many embraces, & protested what shee had done was meerly an effect of hir Duty, which since it was esteem'd a fault, shee would not repeat; neither discover the cause or Author of hir silence. Regeliza thereupon told hir, that to the best of hir observations Altezeera was as constant as faire, & that if shee deceiv'd Artavasdes, shee deceiu'd hir too. Some other Ladyes then coming in, they began a different discourse, which had not cotinu'd above an hower but that (as Regeliza was upon the point of hir returne) shee fell into an indispositio that lasted all that Night, which shee spent on a Couch in Theoxcena's Cabbinet, but the next morning being in some degree recover'd, shee return'd to the Princesse, who soone after fell so extreame ill, that many thought hir Confidents Sicknesse had chang'd its place & communicated it selfe to Altezeera, who gave expresse order, that none should give hir any visits 'till shee were in a fitter codition to receive them. This newes, & this order, very much troubl'd the generous Phanasders Mistris, who apprehended that direction was cheifely for hir, and that it was generall but the better to cloud it as to hir perticuler. But whilst the faire Altezeera lay strugling with a dangerous Sicknesse (which was so much the more so, that the Phisitians were entirely ignorant from whence it proceeded) Arsaces sent a solemne Embassy to Artabazus, to acquaint him, that as nothing but the bestowing the Princesse Altezeera on Pacorus could give Armenia Peace, so that alone should. But alas! hir indisposition so increast, that hir Brother fear'd shee was like to be the Gods rather than Pacorus's. As soone as this fatall newes came to Pacorus knowledge, he blasphem'd them for it so transcendently, that it increast their Title to hir, at least dimminisht his. Those that attended him during Altezeeras Sicknesse, found, his condition was more dangerous from hirs than his owne, and protested, he sent so often to know if shee tooke any rest, that he hinder'd hir from taking any. Three dayes successively Artabazus had constrain'd Pacorus to keepe his Bedd, and silenc't his curiosities by words which assur'd him in fewe Dayes it should be satisfy'd by Altezeeras sight. But Arsaces whose Embassadors were retourn'd with protestations, that nothing but the Princesses Sicknesse hinder'd hir the honor of being his Daughter, grew so impatient of this delay, both in his owne and Pacorus behalfe, and Altezeera's indisposition arriving so vnfortunatly, that it relisht more of designe than mischance, so inflam'd him, that he passionatly sent Artabazus word, vnlesse Altezeera would declare to his Embassadors the same assurance he had, he would looke upon this protraction as a delusion, and resent it at that rate. This harsh message so troubl'd Artabazus, that (all trembling) he went to Altezeera; and conjur'd hir on his knees, by the affection of a Sister, and by the preservation of that Empire in which shee was to succeede, that shee would give hir selfe to Pacorus, who besides the Title of his merit, had that of Power, which though he was so civill as absolutly to decline, yet his Father that had not those invisible restraints, might start into an action, in which they might finde an eternall ruine. Altezeera, to this, (as Regeliza inform'd Theoxcena) reply'd, That the obligations of feare were not so much to be consider'd by generous Mindes, as those of virtue, and that consequently, the Parthian was not to be gratify'd by the ruine of Artavasdes, to whome they were both enguag'd by vndeniable promises, that could shee violate that Faith, it might give a just assurance to Pacorus shee had none, and so that which he design'd as a cure of their disorders, might create as great as those they supprest. Ah Altezeera! (said the King) 'Tis not we but necessity, disobliges Artavasdes, and in beleiving he would sacrifice his Interest for our preservation, we acquaint him how much we beleive he values us; if in this we are not mistaken in him, he is not disoblig'd; and if wee are, he merits to be so. There are (reply'd Altezeera) some things of a quality, in which wee may have so good an opinion of Artavasdes, that we may thereby leave him none of us; and if I be not much mistaken, this performance wilbe of that nature; let us therefore Sir suspend our resolutions, 'till wee know his, and if he can consider any thing above me, I may be induc'd to consider Pacorus above him. If (said Artabazus) you can esteeme it possible to observe this course after you have perus'd this Paper; I durst almost bind my selfe to submit unto it. Then presenting hir Arsaces letter which was the cause of his visit, shee had no sooner read it, than shee coldly said; 'Twas not with those Armes shee was to be vanquisht. But Artabazus who knew there was a storme in that Calme; conjur'd hir with fresh & powerfull motiues to make hir selfe a Conqueror by yeelding; Yet all was in vaine, for though in Teares he implor'd a more mercifull answere, yet the only he could extort from hir was, that if ever shee were Pacorus's it should be as a Guift, and not a Sacrifice. The poore Artabazus almost frantick at this ill successe, went to visit Pacorus, who all this while had labour'd vnder a beleife, that his Princesse was in some extreamity, and that hir being in no danger was rather his information, than hir condition; These being his constant fancyes, 'twas no wonder they were asmuch his dreames, from one of which he was newly waken'd when the King came to see him, whose disorder'd looke, & moyst Eyes, so aboundantly confirm'd his feares, that to remove, or resolve them (upon Artabazus going away (which he did without acquainting him with his Fathers desire and threatning, either as thinking it impertinent if he were accessary to it, & cruell if he were not) Pacorus immediatly caus'd himselfe to be drest, and in spight of his wounds, or Servants, train'd himselfe along to Altezeeras Appartment, where having begg'd and obtain'd a permission to visit hir, he prostrated himselfe on his knees by hir Bedd-side, and after a short silence, which his joy & Paine, made him keepe, he brake it to tell hir. I could not (Madam) so much as hope a pardon for this presumption, did I not tell you the cause of it, which proceeds from so high and iust a concerne in your health; that I have endanger'd myne, to come and learne the state of yours; in which too, I shall finde for the future what to expect from the Gods, for if they graunt not the fervent'st Prayers I am capable of, I must expect they will never condiscend to my others, and so lay aside Devotion as a needlesse or at least a fruitlesse thing. Altezeera, who consider'd Pacorus as accessary to Arsaces Crime, told him coldly, he could best give an accompt whether shee were in any danger, since hir greatest proceeded from his Father, and him. Oh Gods! (continu'd Falintus) how these words struck the poore Pacorus, you only can tell! but I can that his disorder was such, as shee tooke it for his guilt, and that astonishment which should have evinc't his being innocent, made hir thinke he was not; but after his confusion gave him leave to speake he cry'd out, can I then be so neere guilty of so horrid a Sinn as to be thought so by my Princesse? and is shee so much my Enemy that shee will wrong hir perfections rather than not worng Pacorus? ah Madam, if you desire my Death for my presumption, you might have taken some milder course, than to send me out of the world asmuch hated by my selfe, as you: Great Gods! (he continu'd, lifting up his Eyes & his hands) why have you given this excellence so many charmes to inspire love, & so litle Faith to beleive it: Yet madam, perhaps I have done already what might create your beleife of mine, by a more pregnant perswasion than Faith; but alas Pacorus why doest thou so wrong thy actions, as to beleive thy words can create in hir a knowledge of that Truth, when they could not: shew hir by thy Death what thou were dureing thy Life, for shee would not use thee at this rate, were it not for that ende, Yes Madam (he continu'd, addressing his speech againe to Altezeera) I will now satisfy your suspitions or your desires, then drawing out a Ponnyard, which he constantly woare, he was about to increase the crime of that designe, by acting it, when the Princesse cry'd out hold Pacorus I command you, hold, if I have any desires they will be satisfy'd in your obedience, not in your Death, and if I have any doubts, you may be satisfy'd in this Paper, if they were not legittimate. Then shee gave him the Letter Arsaces had sent Artabazus, which he had left with hir, and which Pacorus had no sooner pervs'd than fetching two or three profound sighes he told hir, Yes Madam, I am crimminall, but I am only so in being the Sonne of such a Father, who before a fewe howers are effluxt shall send you assurances of another quality, or you shalbe convinc't I am a sufferer and not a sharer in his Guilt. Thereupon riseing up he tooke his leave with a Countenance so well appropriated to his Words; that those could not more discover his innocency than the other did. As soone as Pacorus was return'd to his Appartment, the violence of his motion, but much more that of his Greife, cast him into a new Feaver, and set his wounds fresh a bleeding with which he writt Arsaces a Letter, so moveing & so passionate, that it obtain'd from him one, which gave him as much satisfaction as that he had sent to Artabazus did the contrary, and another to the Princesse Altezeera, wherein he protested it was to accellerate his Sonnes felicities, that he was so rude as to make use of threatnings, which though it were a strange Cryme, yet it might serve to evince how infinitly he was concearn'd in the honor of hir allyance, since only as a beleiv'd way unto that end, he made no scruples to act it, which he repented of, and begg'd a pardon for; And to put himselfe out of a capacity to repeate that guilt, he would withdrawe his Army if shee commanded it, into Parthia, and 'till he knew with what orders shee would honor him he would (in expectation of them) retire a hunder'd Furlangs from Tygranocerta. This Letter (said Falintus) contain'd many things of a resembling quality, which my memory is not faithfull enough to retaine, & which comeing to Pacorus when Artabazus was with him, he made him the Embassador to carry it to his faire Sister, who receiv'd that testimony of his Innocency and power so well that in the dictates those resentments did inspire, and in that lively representation Artabazus made hir of Pacorus passion and danger, to obey the Kings importunity, and perhapps hir inclination, shee forc't hir weaknesse to write these fewe but powerfull words. Litle Pacorus, if you desire Altezeera should . Never any remedy was more sudden nor efficatious than this,  & if there be any charmes in wordes they sure inhabit in the obligeing ones of Love, Pacorus idolatriz'd Altezeera's, and was a thousand tymes more satisfu'd with them, than with that health they afterwards restor'd; and if he had now any desires, none were more violent than those of recovery, to acknowledge at his Princesse's Feete, that he ow'd not only his but a more transcending Blessing to hir goodnesse. Altezeera too, as if hir Sicknesse had proceeded entirely from hir Constancy; no sooner had divested hir selfe of that, but shee did so of the other, & either to sympathize with, or please, hir Servant, assum'd hir Beauty and health, as fast as he did his. But the faire Theoxcena, either to satisfy hir affection, or hir doubts, went to visit the Princesse, and Regeliza being then gone to pay one to Artabazus (who of late was so taken with hir Company, that many thought it was with hir) none of Altezeeras other women had either the Confidence or the Comand to deny hir an admissio: When shee came in Altezeera was newly fallen into a Slumber, which Theoxcena consider'd as so conduceing to hir health that on that score shee deny'd hir selfe the honor of hir conversation without any reluctancy, & in expectation of it went to a windowe in the Chamber which affoarded a diverting prospect. Not above halfe an hower was expir'd when Regeliza return'd and being ignorant the Princesse was asleepe by hir comeing in interrupted it. Altezeera knowing 'twas Regeliza, open'd the Curtens, and no sooner sawe Theoxcena (who was presenting hirselfe to hir) than shutting them hastily againe shee cry'd out oh Gods! Regeliza, is not it Theoxcena which I see. Yes Madam (said the faire Theoxcena, somewhat surpriz'd) 'tis shee, who has acquainted you with hir rudenesse, that shee might with hir Affection, which could relish of noe quiet 'till shee were satisfy'd of a health for which shee has so great, and so just concearnes. Alas Madam (Altezeera coldly reply'd) if you have any concearnes in mine, I shall begg you to manifest them by denying me any more the honor of your visits, which wilbe a way more conduceing to that ende, than any other you can elect. 'Twere almost as hard to fancy as describe Theoxcena's astonishment, the lowest effect it produc'd was an amazed silence, which Regeliza observeing, drew hir aside, & begg'd hir to impute it rather to a sudden and disorder'd wakeing, or indeed to any thing sooner than a decrease of hir affection, in which too, shee would be a Freind both to Altezeera & to Iustice. But Theoxcena, who ascrib'd it to the reliques of that distaste Regeliza had inform'd hir of, or to hir infringeing the generall orders which prohibited any visits, went againe to the Princesse Bedd-side, and told hir Since the cryme (Madam) of waiteing on you, is esteem'd greater than the dury which invited me to it; I shall henceforward content my selfe to enquire of your health at a lesse offensive distance, and no more pay you my visits by intrusion but obedience. Altezeera having only told hir shee would esteeme't a great obligation, shee withdrew hirselfe, Regeliza waiting on hir to hir Charriott, & making by the way many excuses, which sufficiently manifested themselves to be what they were. I omitted to tell you that the next day after the dispute betwixt Phraates and Labienus, the first of them hearing of a reconciliation, as strange as 'twas either vnexpected, or vndesir'd, sent to visit Pacorus, to implore a forgivenesse for an action, which because 'twas against him, he consider'd as a crime though it were a Duty, and which he might the easilier graunt, since in his very offence he might reade something for his justification, for in manifesting he lov'd a King more than a Brother, it evinc'd how good a Subject he would prove, when he became one, by Pacorus right to the Succession. But Sir (said Falinus to me, after a short silence) you must now prepare your selfe to receive an Intelligence that I hope will verify the Fiction of Achilles Launce, which, not only had the power to give a wound, but to cure it too. Yes (Sir) the Gods gave Altezeera hir health but shee employ'd it to so ill an end, that wee had esteem'd hir Sicknesse a lesse misfortune and if Theoxcena by hir strange vsage had some cause to suspect shee was distracted when shee kept hir Chamber, wee had much more to beleive shee was so when shee left it, since the first action shee then did, was solemnly to promise hirselfe to Racorus. Yet Artabazus impos'd this restriction on the Graunt, that hir Nuptialls should not be celebrated in Armenia, nor 'till the Parthians were retir'd, lest that which shee intended as a guift might looke like a constraint, and that the Armenians might be consol'd in the losse of such a freind, by being free'd from so many Enemyes. If Sir (Continu'd Falintus) you esteeme this a losse, doe but reflect on the cause of it, and you can no longer thinke it one, which opinion I have so justly assum'd, that for your releife, I will not conjure you to make use of your fortitude but your reason only. Great Gods! (I cry'd out, all pale and trembling) is it possible then (Falintus) that Altezeera can be false? and that Feare, not love, should create hir sinn? Must that which creates it be as great an offence to virtue, as me? vnjust heavens! (I continu'd) could you give none the greatest will to ruine me, but hir that had the greatest power to doe it? And did you raise me to the highest hopes, but to make my despaire resembling? Alas Falintus: I must summon Death  & not Reason for my cure, since the latter in this occasion does with me as it does in the misteries of Divinity, it may confound but cannot helpe: Neither has the reflection on hir constancy the power to doe it, for I finde That, more my misfortune than hir fault, & what satisfaction can it prove that shee had no imperfection but what was only one to me; hir crime is not that shee wants lovelinesse but Love, and hir new Conquest cannot more certainely evince the former, than my Death must vnavoydably the latter. If Sir (reply'd Falintus) 'twas Altezeera & not the Crowne of Armenia you ambition'd--- Ah Freind (I cry'd out interrupting him) may the Gods continue me in as great torments as they have cast me into, if ever I ambition'd any Crowne, but one of Mirtles, so it were of Altezeera's puting on, and having lost the hopes of that Crowne, if I doe not contemne all others, asmuch as shee does my Passion. Then Sir (continu'd Falintus) in my opinion your Case is not so desperate as your thoughts suggest, for in that very performance in which shee has taken away your hopes, shee has given you some, since shee that has bin once inconstant, may be thought with probability to prove so againe. I, but Falintus (I reply'd) you say shee is in a manner marryed to Pacorus. 'Tis true (said Falintus) but that mistery in Nuptialls of two being one, is oftner visible to Faith than Sence; and was there never yet a Wife was kinde to any but hir husband? Great Gods! (I cry'd out, starting up and laying my hand upon my Sword) that any but a Freind durst say this, and that a Freind should; No No Falintus, the way you take, will give me rather horror, than love, for I should hate hir more for being so kind, than so vnconstant; though I am an Enemy unto hir, I am not so vnto hir virtue, which did I but beleive were stain'd or so much as capable of being so, I should injure hir asmuch as shee has my Passion, or my Hopes. But Falintus who perceiv'd how great my fury was by the paine I had to suppresse it; That he had inspir'd me with asmuch rage as greife; and that he had given me a Poyson rather than Cordiall, was so just and so civill, as to implore my pardon, beseeching me to beleive that he passionatly ambition'd my consolation, since out of but a bare hope of giving me some litle, he scrupl'd not to taxe Altezeera's virtue, which too he had done, because he esteem'd it a maxime in the cure of Love, to give the Lover an ill opinion of hir, that made him one. Yes Falintus (I reply'd) embraceing him with some sighes, I forgive you, & will only enjoyne you for reparation to beleive for my sake what you should for Iustices, which is, that Altezeera has noe faults but such as are only so to the vnfortunate Artavasdes, and that shee is as perfect in all things as I am in Misery. I had rather (said Falintus) robb yon of that Faith, than assume it, for I feare if it continue yours, it may make us lose what we esteeme asmuch, as ever you did Altezeera; The short remainder of whose story, I will begg your permission to tell you, that you may finde some consolation in hir fault, since I beleive shee begins to finde in it, hir punnishment. I would (I reply'd) listen to your relation, with a higher satisfaction, if my Life aswell as my felicity had bin tyde to it, and were to expire with it. I beleive (said Falintus) if you hated not Altezeera you would never have mention'd so offensive a wish, for I am confident your Death would prove a much greater trouble to hir, than hir inconstancy can to you. Would to the Gods (I reply'd) I were certaine of that, it should not be long before I acted in one performance, both my Revenge,  & my Quiet: but (I continu'd) generous Falintus let me not thus interrupt the finishing of your Relation, in which perhaps I may finde some reasons to make your thoughts my beleife, & to which I will listen with asmuch attention, as one in so transcedent a Torment is capable of. I have already (said Falintus prosecuting his narration) acquainted you with that publique & solemne enguadgement which Altezeera gave Pacorus, which too was in the presence of Arsaces, Phraares, Surena, and Labienus (who then was recover'd of his wounds) and the Parthian King to evince he had neither any remnants of hatred, or feare, came into Tygranocerta only with those vsuall Guards which attended his person. The joy of this contract was exprest in a solemne Tilting, in which Surena obtain'd entirely the honor, which too he purchast at so much the easier rate, because Phanasder would not dispute it, who had too- deepe an impression of your Greife, to receive any of joy, especially in a performance, the cause whereof had divested him of all his. But though neither he, nor I assisted at this publique celebration, yet we resolu'd Altezeera should not runn into a Sinn without being told of it, which Phanasder and I joyntly went to hir Appartment to performe, where we were receiu'd with that grace which is as vnseparable from hir as charmeing is from it; but as soone as ever we began to acquaint hir with the occasion of our visit, shee impos'd on us a perpetuall silence, and gave us no reason why we should keepe it, but that 'twas hir Command; only shee told Phanasder, he had cause indeede to solicite hir in it. To which he reply'd That perfect Freindship (Madam) I pay Artavasdes, gives me an abundant cause to solicite for his felicity, and perhaps the care I have of you, Madam, is not a much inferiour one. I beseech the Gods (shee reply'd smileing) that both Artavasdes, & I, may deserve your care. Phanasder begg'd hir to interpret hir prayer, and hir smile, but when he perceiu'd shee absolutly declin'd it, to shew we came on busines and not on duty, we immediatly retir'd, curseing either the nature, or humor of hir Sexe, which to preserve a charitable opinion of, wee went to Theoxcena, to whome wee gave an accompt of our visit, which shee would not accompany us in, hir last having had so vnfortunat a successe. That generous Princesse seem'd to be glad that either Altezeera by hir silence confest hir Cryme was of a quality, where to offer to extenuate, was to increase it, or that hir guilt was such a Torment, that shee avoyded all entertainments which could revive it; and though this were hir opinion of the Princesses silence yet shee hop't it would not be yours, but that you would ascribe it to an insolence as high, as hir Inconstancy, that therein since shee would not reward your Passion, yet at least that shee would cure it. But Phanasder who could not put an interpretation upon Altezeera's prayer, that you might merit his Freindship, at last plac't one upon hir saying, he had cause to solicite for you, as meaning his not preserveing Tygranocerta reduc'd hir to need it; And though wee represented to him shee could not act so transcendent an injustice, as to lay that to him as a Cryme, in which he had purchas'd so much glory; yet wee could not efface his suspitions, which he fortify'd by saying, shee that could be capable of so high an injustice as abandoning you, for Pacorus, might justly be suspected to be capable of any other. Regeliza who formerly, often visited Theoxcena, still continu'd that practice, protesting to be as ignorant of the cause of hir Princesses inconstancy, as troubl'd at it; shee too invited hir from Altezeera to continue hir visits, who confest shee could not more sensibly revenge hir Injures, than shewing hir by a dayly conversation those charmes, of which by hir misfortune shee had so long depriv'd hirselfe, and which shee begg'd hir to impute to hir Sicknesse, and not to hir change. Theoxcena thus civilly invited, and knowing that what Altezeera alleag'd would proove hir revenge would be come hir owne satisfaction, shee went to visit the Princesse, where though shee vs'd hir with the same Civilities shee had formerly practic'd, yet Theoxcena's judgement, or suspitions, deny'd hir a beleife that they were with the same freedome; and indeed it is a common observation in most of that Sexe, that a division betwixt any of them, though it may be clos'd againe, yet there will be still remaining some Cicatrice, that will perpetually shew where the wound has bin; But Theoxcena who scrutinously obseru'd all shee did, round, that hir joy was but a parte shee acted, since shee was often out of it, and as shee has told Phanasder, and I, shee has divers tymes observ'd hir readdy to shedd Teares in hir highest Mirth, and in the midd'st of a discourse to stopp, & start, as if hir ill-Angell had melt hir; neither was this hir practice only in hir Chamber, but in the greatest Assemblyes, which cleerly manifested hir resolutions were not as strong, as hir Greife, or Guilt. Regeliza told Theoxcena too, that shee had severall tymes surpriz'd Altezeera in such Agonyes, that had you seene them, they would have converted your relentments, into sorrowe. One Euening too, Theoxcena found shee had not made hir Princesse's condition worse than it really was, for, comeing to visit hir, and findeing no body in the Chamber, shee stole to the Cabbinett Doore, where lookeing through a crevice of it, shee discover'd Altezeera, acting sorrowe so to the Life, that shee apprehended 'twould have prov'd hir Death; and indeede Theoxcena, found in that sight, asmuch cause to pitty, as to condemne hir inconstancy; which had so strong an operation over hir, that shee immediatly retir'd, apprehending lest the visibility of hir disorders might have manifested shee had discover'd the Princesses. But shee was no sooner return'd to hir owne Palace, than shee was visited by the generous Phanasder, and I, where having told us what shee had so freshly disclosed (which in our judgements evinc't Altezeera had more inclination to repaire, than continue hir Crymes) Phanasder after a short debate with himselfe propounded that which I extreamly relisht, but which Theoxcena did not, which was, that he would cause a powerfull insurrection in Armenia, which should necessitate the Parthian Army to continue in it, and consequently Altezeera not to goe out of it; That seemingly to suppresse it, he would raise Forces to joyne with Pacorus Army, That in the meane tyme upon some pretence of Affaires into Syria, I should from thence goe directly to Rome, and informe you of all that had happen'd, to desire you to make of your perticuler Interest, one of State, and to presse Crassus (who wee heard was to invade Parthia) to advance speedily into Armenia, and to hinder an allyance, which if not prevented would render his Conquests impossible, and if prevented, as facile; and lastly to assure you that upon your appearance either with the Romans, or singly, all the seemeing Rebells and his Forces, should declare for you, and thereby force Altezeera to as great a necessity of giveing hirselfe to you, as shee pretended there had bin, to give hirselfe unto Pacorus; or at least make it cleerely evident hir inconstancy was hir choyce, and not hir constraint; which too, you might have the power to punnish, in him that was the Creator of it. This generous Motion (as I told you) I infinitly approv'd, but the faire Theoxcena seem'd asmuch averse to it, both as induc'd therevnto out of that high concerne shee had in Phanasders safety, and perhaps reputation, which might both runn no small hazard in this action, as out of doubt too, that it might appeare to you rather a disobligation, than the contrary, who perhaps by thus having lost the hope of possessing hir, had also lost the desire. To these and many as pregnant Arguments wee represented the duty of Freinds, and the inclination of a Lover, the first not more powerfully inviting our assistance, than Altezeera's Melancholly would the continuation of your Passion, and the freeing hir from Pacorus's; Yet for all this wee obtain'd Altezeera's consent rather by hir silence, than by hir graunting it. Having thus elected this resolve, vnder a pretence of paying a vowe to the God Æsculapius, when I recover'd of my wounds, I begg'd and obtain'd leave from Artabazus to goe into Syria to a Temple dedicated to him, which stood upon the Bankes of Euphrates; Phanasder would have accompany'd me the first dayes journy, which I absolutly declin'd, lest it might give a suspition of that, which were absolutly ruin'd, if any were taken of it; we therefore tooke leave in Tygranocerta, from whence in three dayes he determin'd to depart, to put that in execution which we had in designe; but insteed of goeing to this Temple, I went but two dayes on the way thither and the third (without any Servant because 'twas a Pilgrimage) I tooke the shortest way to Tyre, where having hir'd a swift Quinquerem Gally, the winde too blowing faire at East till we came to the length of Tarentum to which wee sail'd and row'd in sixteene dayes (so signally did the Gods favour my employment) I caus'd the Mariners to put into this Gulph, which though I thought a misfortune, I now finde is a providence, and hope you will so improve it, as not to make the Gods repent they have conferr'd it on you. 'Twas thus said the generous Artavasdes to Artabbanes  & Callimmachus) that Falintus finisht His relation, which I hope you have too just an opinion of me not to remember, & though it be of my telling, yet that it was in his words, since many of them were so flattering, that I could not have bin vaine enough to have spoake them of my selfe; neither will I trouble you with any of my sorrows, or disorders, otherwise than by a breife and true assurance, that they were proportionate to my losse; which, to repaire or revenge, I determin'd to make use of that excesse of Gallantry which the generous Phanasder had offer'd me, & to effcte it, immediatly to returne with Falintus in his Gally. But alas this resolve was no sooner form'd than the thought of leaving Artabbanes in Rome, & of retireing without him destroy'd it suddenly againe, and that too with more reason than 'twas form'd. But Ventidius observing my trouble, and fancying the cause, so absolutely vndertooke my excuse, and the care & protection of you (for continu'd Artavasdes) you know by your permission I had acquainted him who you were) that in the transports of an injur'd, & hopefull Lover, I at last receiv'd Ventidius assurances as satisfactory, and having againe by vowes confirm'd him my permission to serve Vdozia, and my assistance to obtaine hir, I stay'd no longer than I writt to my deare Artabbanes, that I referr'd the cause of my fault, & the care of his and the generous Sillaces safety to Ventidius's relation and Freindship, which being finisht, I went immediatly without any Servane but Philanax to Falintus his Gally, where after a Million of embraces and vowes of an eternall Freindship, I tooke a finall leave of Ventidius, who promis'd to appologize for my abrupt departure to the Senate, by the advantage they would probably derive from it, and who immediatly departed for Rome, as wee did for Asia. The same winde which had hinder'd Falintus Navigation, so favour'd ours, that in eighteene dayes wee Landed at Alexandretta, from whence with extraordinary diligence in six dayes more I arriv'd at Satala, a principality which was fallen to me by the generous Annexanders Death, & in which Vdozia resided, whome I went purposely to see, & to give hir those just impressions of Ventidius which should fortify hir Heart against the receptio of any others. I sawe hir (my deare Artabbanes) & found in that sight how much injury the Painter had done hir, & how much right Ventidius had done himselfe in his election, for indeed never Beauty did both promise & give so much at once as Vdozia's, which (in a word) possest such transcendent perfections, that had it not bin for the reliques of my Passion, I might have found the honor of being hir Brother, would not be greater than the misfortune. After those professions which my relations & esteeme made me make, I began to conjure hir by both, that shee would fixe hir thoughts upon a person which I not only esteem'd most worthy of them, but which was really so, and which shee might be in some degree confirm'd in, when his interiour graces were at least equall to those perfections of Nature, of which I presented hir an imperfect Coppy; thereupon I gave hir Ventidius's Picture, in a Box so pretious, that nothing could be more, but what it contein'd; and then gave hir a Caracter of him, which though it were short of Truth (which had bin an inevitable error to whosoever had vndertaken it) yet it fail'd not to produce that effect, which a more proportionat one to his desert had done; for Vdozia, whilst I was speaking, with hir Cheekes, di'de with a perfect Vermilion, so concernedly consider'd the generous Ventidius Picture, that I thought shee would be wounded in the same way in which shee had wounded him; and I was no sooner silenc't, than shee told me; I know not Sir whether I have more cause to be satisfy'd with your care, or to be the contrary in so evident a demonstratio that you doubt my obedience and affection, since in this one Comand concerning Ventidius I finde pregnant arguments of both, for your election cannot more abundantly demonstrate the former, than your so earnestly commanding me, what is asmuch an effect of my judgement, as obedience does the latter. Deare Vdozia (I reply'd) embraceing hir) I am not so much an Enemy to my owne Felicity, as to doubt your affection, but if I did, your giving your selfe to any man at my request had abundantly supprest in me that beleife, since when you scruple not to be vnjust (for I esteeme too transcendent a reward to be a kinde of injustice, and your giving your selfe to any Mortall, is that Reward) to raise in me that Faith; I cannot decline making it mine, without revenging on my selfe my owne incredulity. Vdozia still retaining hir blushes (which this discourse continu'd in as high a quality as my request for Ventidius had created them in,) made me a returne as full of flatterry as mine was voyde of any, and then gave me a possitive assurance of an absolute resigning hir selfe to my dispose. I thought it then high tyme to let hir know the generous Annexanders Death, which 'till then I had declin'd, because greife was an ill preparative to Love, being of a contrary quality, and because I thought if shee receiv'd the former, it would so entirely possesse hir Heart, that the latter would not have so dangerous an admittance; at last by degrees I acquainted hir with that fatall Intelligence, which having forc'd us to mingle our Teares together, by litle and litle I began to drye my owne, and shee hirs in immitation of me; but knowing that to divert a sorrow, is to lessen it, I resum'd againe my discourse of Ventidius, to whome I told hir I would, and to whome I then did dispatch an expresse, to acquaint him with his Felicity, which I assur'd hir he was determin'd to come and implore at the head of fifty thousand Romans, whose courages so lead, would soone inuest hir in Empires as large, as the heart which ador'd hir. I then began to enquire in what posture Armenia stood, for Satala was upon the Frontiers of it, and the first place in the Kingdome I had rested in: Vdozia told me all things were in a generall quiet: that the Parthian Army (upon the Intelligence that Crassus lay about the famous Temple of Hievapodis intending suddenly to invade their Country) were all with Arsaces return'd into it, but 10000 Horse which remain'd as Guards to Pacorus  & Altezeera, who were shortly to follow, and which had hitherto bin interrupted by a fresh indisposition of the latters, who yet was now so well recover'd that in three dayes, shee with Pacorus, intended to leave Tygranocerta, and to begin their journy for Parthia, on the Frontiers of which Empire Arsaces with all the Gallantry of it, had publisht he would meete them, and that all this shee had receiu'd by an Expresse, the day before, from Lindesia: I was not more astonisht to learne Armenia was in so perfect a Tranquility, than joy'd to finde Altezeera had not yet left it; so after a short reflection on both, I ascrib'd the former to the latter, and that the Gods by having so obligingly detain'd hir, had induc'd Phanasder to suspend that Insurrection he intended, another cause producing the effect for whiche only that was design'd. Neither was my Fancy so litle flattering as not to create in me some hopes that Altezeeras indisposition was rather a pretence than a reallity, and purposely contriv'd to give me tyme to come to hir rescue, and my owne Felicity: In this Faith I esteem'd it not requisite to invite Crassus invasion, who too, being in this place, was at too great a distance to answer so sudden an occasion as mine, but rather to flye to Tygranocerta, and there to forme my resolutions according to my Intelligence. Therefore having found Vdozia had asmuch discretion as Beauty, to let hir know that was my beleife, I privatly sent for Cleomen, the Governor of Satala, who I comanded thencforth to obey Vdozias orders, to whome I left intirely the care & Government of all: Cleomen gave me a Million of Thankes for so pleasing a Command, and publisht himselfe exceedingly satisfy'd, that what he had hitherto done by inclination he should now doe by duty. Then after having given Vdozia fresh assurances of a passionat affection & freindship, and conjurd both hir and Cleomen to keepe my being in Armenia a Secret, with fresh Horses and only with Falintus and Philanax, in fower dayes I crost the Lower Armenia, and came to Tygranocerta, late at Night; the first place I lighted at was at the Pallace of Theoxcena with whome I was confident to finde Phanasder, or learne where I might, and by the advice of so good Freinds and Iudgements, fixe upon the best resolution; but there I learn't, Theoxcena had that day left Tygranocerta with Artabazus, and all the Court who were gone to accompany Pacorus and Altezeera towards the Frontiers of Parthia. Oh Gods! what horror did this fatall Newes strike me with? but not to contribute to my misfortune, I determin'd (having given our Horses a litle refreshment) to follow that Beauty which fledd both from my Passion and me; and therefore went directly to Phanasders Lodgings, for I could not learne at Theoxcena's any Intelligence of him, but that he was not gone with hir. Falintus, who went in first, got me a private Appartment, in which I continu'd 'till he return'd, who soone brought me word, that Phanasder was a Dayes journy from Tygranocerta & that before he went, he had left order, if any came to him from either of us, that he should be speedily advertis'd of it, I therefore immediatly dispatcht a Messenger to him to let him know I was come, and that I would the next day overtake Altezeera, and learne my destiny from hir whilst shee was in Armenia, & that if he would follow me he should be certaine to heare of me from Theoxcena, to whome only besides the Princesse I would discover my selfe. This Expresse being dispatch'd, after three howers rest, we began againe to prosecute our journy, and the next Night overtooke the Court which by good fortune lay at a Magnificent Castle of Evaxes, whether as soone as we arriv'd I endeavour'd by all meanes possible to speake to Theoxcena, but neither my owne endeavours, nor those of Falintus and Philanax could procure it, vnlesse absolutly one of us would discover himselfe, which we positively esteem'd destructive to our designe; therefore, after a short consideration I resolv'd to make my sese knowne to Evaxes, of whose fidelity I was justly confident, and from him to implore the blessing of an opportunity to entertaine without any witnesse the Princesse Altezeera. The Civill Evaxes, joyfully receiv'd my disclosing my selfe, & more the meanes I gave him of obligeing me, which he vndertooke possitiuely, and bringing me by stolne passages to that Roome allotted for hir Bedd-Chamber, he plac't me in a Cabbinet contiguous to it, and assur'd me so to order all things, that once that Night, I should have that opportunity I so passionatly implor'd. I embrac't him a Thousand tymes for this obligation, and gave him as many verball retributions, which finisht, I only conjur'd him to tell me truely whether Altezeera were yet Marryed to Pacorus, to which he absolutely assur'd me shee was not, neither would be, 'till hir arrivall in Parthia. Immediatly after this he left me, and 'twas alreddy so late, that I had not bin above halfe an hower in my impatiency and my Prison, when through a favourable litle hole, I perceiv'd the Princesse come into the Chamber with all those Charmes with which shee conquer'd whosoeuer beheld hir, and waited upon by Pacorus the last evincement of that Power. Chirurgions coming in interrupted it by acquainting him 'twas tyme to dresse both his and Artabbanes wounds. This summons they obey'd though in it the last of them found a new affliction in his Freinds hurts, whose dressing was so long of necessity to suspend a Naration, in which he could not be more concearn'd than he was ravisht; but at length the Chirurgions having perform'd their duties,  & having assur'd their Patients, that their wounds were as hopefull as their Arte could wish, they immediatly by Callimmachus Command withdrew themselves, & then Artavasdes, upon his & Artabbanes passionat desire, thus resum'd his story, where they had interrupted it. PARTHENISSA. THE SECOND PRATE THE THIRD BOOKE. seeing of so many Beautyes, and of him which ravisht them from me! Ah (said I to my selfe) goe Artavasdes, and prostrat at thy Princesses Feete, conjure hir not to make hir selfe the Reward of any thing but hir perfect'st Adorer,  & in that quality implore hir for thy selfe; If Pacorus pretend a Title to hir vnder that notion, decide it before the Iudge, & Recompence of the Combate, and by vanquishing thy Ryvall, conquer hir disdaine, and Inconstancy, or by being uanquisht by him, end thy Torments, and thy Life: This Artavasdes, is the noblest, aswell as readyest expedient; but alas (I continu'd) shee that preferr'd Pacorus before thee, will not so much hazard the object of hir Love, & Inconstancy, as to expose his Life to a hand, which stricks with the Sword of Iustice, & Revenge. Whilst I was building & destroying a Thousand such resolutions, and thoughts, Pacorus was entertaining Altezeera with all the respect, & devotion, so great a Beauty & flame could inspire. I must confesse my disorders for a while gave me not leave to consider what he was doeing, or what he said, but when they did, I endeavour'd by an extraordinary attentivenesse to repaire that pretious tyme I had so misimploy'd,  & I was no sooner compos'd to a settl'd hearing, than I heard Pacorus, who kneel'd before Altezeera, thus speake to hir. My Princesse, alas, why did you confine my joyes from being perfected 'till you came into Parthia? was it to torment the ambition of my desires, by so long a protraction of them; or to punnish my Cryme in my continuance of it? or else did you so much injure my Felicity, to esteeme it of so common a quallity, that circumstances could indeere it? and that the suspention of the blessing, could bring any accession to it? if it be the first of these, to continue the punishment of an aspireing which my Princesse hath so often pardon'd to my reitterated Prayers, and Teares, is to be asmuch vnjust as shee is capable of; and if the latter, shee is almost as injurious to hirselfe, as cruell to me. Ah (thought I) how vnjust are the Gods rather, to conferr their Blessings on one, who has no title to them, and who if he had, merits none, by exclayming against a felicity which nothing but a litle Tyme will place him in, and perfect; when at the same instant they divest me, not only of the joyes, but hopes of them, when shee too which ought to be the distributer of them is mine, by services, by guift, and by vowes. That distance betwixt the place where Altezeera was, and where I remain'd so sadd an Auditor, was so great, that shee not vttering hir answer with that violence Pacorus had done his question, I could not heare it, but I remember after he had printed an ardent kisse upon hir hand, he rose up, and told hir; I will goe rather Madam, and implore the Gods either to hasten the motions of Tyme, or retard those of my impatiency, for whilst they both continue as they are, my torments must doe the like; Then after some discourses, which I heard but in broaken partes, he withdrew himselfe. I observ'd, that for a short tyme after, none appear'd in the Chamber, nor that any noyse was made about it, & beleiving I deriv'd this opportunity from Evaxes favour, and enguadgement, not to lose it I came trembling and pale, out of my concealment, and goeing to Altezeera in an vnequall pace, I no sooner came to hir Feete, than prostrating my selfe at them, I told hir. If Madam, the miserable Artavasdes presents himselfe before you, 'tis not to reproach your having made him so, nor to summon you of those holy, and passionat vowes, which rais'd his joyes to a transcendency nothing can proportion, but the Torments your having canceal'd them, has cast him into: Neither faire Princesse, can you tell him it can be more his duty, than he does you, that 'tis his inclination, to create your felicity by the ruine of his owne. He does not therefore come to conjure you not to give that blessing to the greatnesse of Pacorus Title, which you a thousand tymes have promis'd to the greatnesse of his passion, for He alwayes esteem'd it so vnjust you should bestowe the Divine Altezeera, on one who is almost asmuch hir Subject by the advantage of hir Birth, as by that of hir Beauty, that He would have kill'd himselfe, that He would have dy'd to prevent in hir so crimminall a Mercy, & if He hath liv'd in a contrary flattering hope, 'twas only because He esteem'd no sinn so great, as to disobey hir. Whilst I was speaking a thousand things of this quality, which too I vtter'd in the pressing'st accents that ever the highest greife & flame was capable of. Altezeera was so surpriz'd, & astonisht, that had hir affectio remain'd as fixt as hir Body then did, I had bin exempted from transcendent torments, by resembling felicities; nor did shee a while after I had ended speaking, give me any answer which might have resolv'd my doubts, whether hir silence proceeded from a cruell, or obligeing cause, for all shee said when shee broake hirs, was only, oh Gods! Is this Artavasdes that I see? Yes Madam (I reply'd) 'tis that Artavasdes who has given the Divine Altezeera so absolutly his Life, that he durst not without hir permission put a period to it, though what shee has of late acted, has made him languish in such Torments, that the best way of making them cease next to that of the blessing of hir esteeme, is to make them cease, by the blessing of Death: 'Tis therefore (Madam) I present you this ponyard, that if you will not be just to your vowes, and promises, yet at least, that you wilbe charitable to him, to whom they were made; and if I implore any, thing before I dye, 'tis only that I may doe it with the consolation, of receiving my ease from hir, from whome I have my sufferings, and that shee will declare I dy'd as innocent, as vnfortunat. This (faire Princesse) if your justice does now deny me, your pitty cannot long, for my languishings will evince, Death is the lesser Ill; neither Madam doe I implore it on any scoare but yours, for my sufferings proportionating my losse, will make such deepe impressions in you, that your joyes in your intended Nuptialls, will receive a resembling disturbance, at least if you have not as absolutely banisht compassion from your heart, as Love; Thereupon kissing the Hilts of the Ponnyard, I offer'd that part of it to hir, and presenting hir my Brest, I implor'd hir to make, what had bin the Scene of hir highest Empire, now that of a proportionat pitty. But alas shee declin'd makeing use of that weapon, to wound me with a more cruell one, I meane hir words, which accompany'd with an inflam'd looke told me; Traytor Artauasdes, though thy Crymes merit I should become thy Executioner, aswell as thy Iudge, yet I decline being the former, to make them appeare the greater; and if (as thou say'st) thou doest esteeme no sinn higher than to disobey me, I command thee evince the troth of that profession, by never comeing againe into my sight. Then reseing up hastily, shee went out of the Chamber by the same Doore shee came into it, and though hir remove was very sudden; and that my amazement was as great, yet I cry'd out, stay Altezeera, though Artavasdes know himselfe innocent, yet because you doe not thinke him so, behold how he will punnish not his Guilt, but his misfortune, then runing to that Ponnyard shee had fling away, I tooke it up, and in the horror and despaire of my condition, I had sheath'd it in my Heart, if Evaxes (who listen'd at a back Doore) had not hastily come in, and snatching it out of my hand, prevented it. Though it be a transcendent wrong, when one is in proportionat misery, to take away the cure of it, yet my rage not having so absolutly blinded me, but, that knowing what was in its owne nature an offence, was intended for a charity, I only told Evaxes (having first furiously look't on him) 'tis in vaine Evaxes, 'tis in vaine you thinke to keepe me from Death, by having only tooke from me one meanes of acting it, when the wayes which leade vnto the Grave cannot be more, than the causes which invite me to it, then turning from him, & observing Altezeera was gone, I rann precipitatly after hir, but alas shee had lock't the Doore upon me, & thereby I found shee had not only excluded me from the hopes of possessing hir, but from those of clearing an immaginary guile, to which shee implicitly ascrib'd that fatall deprivation. In the rage of so strange an vsage, I was a thousand tymes about to have forc't it open, had not Evaxes hinder'd me, by representing, that if Altezeera had not apprehended my vindication, shee would neither have then deny'd listning to it, nor debatr'd me the meanes of discovering how passionat I was to evince it; That since hir actions so evidently demonstrated that Truth, I ought to impute hir objecting Crymes to my Charge, but as a Cloud for hir owne, and consider that to be hir inconstancy which shee disguis'd under the name of hir resentments; That since shee was of so volatile a disposition 'twas better I had made that discovery in the condition I was yet in, than in that which Pacorus was so neere embraceing, since I might consider, that as my felicity, which he could not learne but as his Torment; that it was still an argument shee loved me, when shee declin'd imposeing those miseries on me my desires ambition'd, to conferr them on another, in whose subsequent Troubles I should pleaseingly disclose those I had so happily avoyded. These reasons would have appear'd so to any but Me, and would too so to me, had I but listen'd to them, which then I did not, for all the while he was speakeing, I was so too, somtymes resolving to goe & punnish Artabazus for having bin so farre from hindring his Sisters Inconstancy, that he solicited & provoked it; But then the reflection on the greatnesse of the Sinn, hinder'd me from acting it, especially too when that reflexion was fortyfy'd by that on his Quality which made it a greater injustice not to act for the safety of his Subjects in generall, than to doe it for any one of them in particular, so that I had noe just cause to be offended with him, for having of two evills elected the least. My fury not findeing a fitt obiect in him, I began to contemplate Pacorus as one, who was not only the Cause of Altezeera's Inconstancy, but the Continuer of it, & whose destruction would both revenge me on him, and hir. But then the reflexion on the occasion of his Sinn appear'd a sufficient Apologie for it, & knowing how impossible 'twas to see, and not love Altezeera, in the very necessity of his fault, I excus'd it; besides, by services and enguagements shee could not be more Mine, than upon both those scoares shee was Pacorus's, and yet I had bin so vnjust as to solicit hir for Artavasdes, and therefore 'twere to be more so, to punish that in another which I practic'd in my selfe; that shee was only Mine by the first graunt, & his by the last, which in all concessions of Love is the binding'st Title, and lastly that I ow'd a life vnto him, which 'till I had repay'd, I was his debtor, and therefore should not be his Murtherer. Whilst my Reason and my Passion were thus making warre against each other, Evaxes who still apprehended the last of them would fling me into some strange Cryme, and that my continuance where I was, might into a proportionate danger, (all the Guards in the Castle being Parthians) he conjur'd me so passionatly to retire to an appartment he had provided for me, and there establish my Resolutions, when my resentments were so qualify'd as not to silence the dictates of my Reason, that at last by following, rather than by promise, I obey'd him, who led me by a stolne Passage to my Chamber, not meeting any one by the way, which though we had, I am confident I had not bin discover'd, if at least I had bin as vnknowable to all, as I was to my selfe. There I told Falintus, & Philanax what had happen'd, and there 'twas that Evaxes repeating those reasons my rage hinder'd me from heareing (which too were strengthen'd by many others as powerfull from Falintus) I determin'd the next morning as an evincement of their operation, to retire into some solitude, and there spend asmuch tyme as the banishing Altezeera from my Heart, would take up, whose influence there was not alreaddy a litle eclipst, since I could forme a resolution of extingushing it. This declaration prov'd as pleasing to them, as that which created it, was the contrary to me, but they having retir'd themselves I past the Night in such confus'd thoughts, that it had bin difficult to have collected any thing from them, but that they were the productions of an exorbitant distemper. The day no sooner appear'd, than telling Falintus, and Evaxes, whither I intended to goe the next Night, and having commanded Philanax to follow me, assoone as he had learnt from them whether my being in Armenia and my last action were discover'd, how they were both relisht, and whether I might safely demand Iustice of Artabazus for Annexanders Murther, that in the certainty of being deny'd it, I might thereby act it my selfe, immediatly (before the Court was up) I tooke horse, and was accompany'd out of the Castle by Evaxes, who for a long while made no small scruples to trust me alone, being so newly recover'd from a despaire, whose effects were yet somwhat visible in my face; but having secur'd his jealousies by many vowes, and by the improbability of my so much contributing to my Enemyes Triumphes, I finally tooke leave of him, and had not travell'd above a hunder'd Furlongs, when coming into a Wood at the extreamity of a great Plaine, I was stopp't by a violent Crye behind me, which turning about to learne the Cause of, I sawe the Man that vtter'd it, come runing towards me, as fast as his Horse could carry him; As soone as he came neere me he drew his Sword, and bad me defend my selfe, if my Crymes had not divested me of the Courage to justify them. This declaration though it much surpriz'd me, yet I did not neere so much as the knowledge that 'twas Phanasder which made it; but being confident he mistooke me, I prepar'd my selfe for nothing but to embrace him; and offer him my Sword and Life to joyne in his Revenge, but perceiving he esteem'd himselfe discharg'd of all other Ceremonyes by having denounc't, the Combate, I cry'd out to him, hold Phanasder, 'tis Artavasdes speakes to you. 'Tis he (Phanasder briskly reply'd) that I seeke,  & who to his other Tryumphs must add that of my Life, or in the losse of his I must repaire my wrongs. Oh Gods (I answer'd) if my Death could be but as great a satisfaction to Phanasder, as to me, he would oblige us both in acting it; but since such a satisfaction cannot be perfected without as great a Cryme, let me vnderstand first wherein you esteeme me guilty, for if I doe not so entirely vindicate Artavasdes, that you must acknowledge Phanasder crimminall, for having thought him so; I will imploy my Sword, not to resist, but execute your Revenge. If thy Crimes (said Phanasder) were not too-too-much apparent, I should not have sought this opportunity which since they are, I will not spend it to shew thee thy Sinns, but to punish them; Then, having againe bid me defend my selfe, or my submission should not be my Sanctuary, he charg'd me with such fury that I found by experiment the high Caracter I allwayes had of his Courage, was but too-dangerous a Truth; But his rude reply to an offer he could not have declin'd without seekeing to be my Enemy, & the certainty I found, that I must derive my safety not from my Innocence, but resistance, though they made me finally drawe my Sword, yet I made but use of it to keepe him from acting a Sinn, I know he would in a right vnderstanding asmuch deplore, as now he was solicitous to performe; and indeed he prest me so incessantly and vigorously, that had not an vnexpected accident ended the Combate, my Death or his must have done it; for making a furious blowe at my head, and I defending it with my sword, his flew out of his hand in two peices. At this Phanasder was not more astonisht than I was satisfy'd, which I exprest by telling him, Phanasder let that life I give you, convince you that I am still your freind. No, no, Artavasdes (he hastily reply'd) it convinces me thou art the Contrary, for if thou wert not, having loaden me with such sorrowes, thou wouldst not deny me their cure, being it is in thy power, therefore I declare, if thou canst be yet concearn'd in having me esteeme thee my Freind, nothing can be more contributory to it, than to make use of thy victory, which the more to induce thee to, I protest by all those wrongs thou hast done me, I will leave no place vnsearch't nor no meanes vnattempted for my Revenge. If (said I) my giveing you your Life after your first declaration has not convinc't you that I am your Freind; I hope the doeing it after this latter will sufficiently effect it, for were I concearn'd in your Death I have not only the power, but the provocation to act it; But Phanasder, I had rather expose my Life to your fury, than secure it by the destruction of what I preferr a Thousand tymes before it, which not only my Freindship for you, but even your hatred to me: makes me professe, and which I still implore to learne the subject of, that if I doe not extinguish your desire of revenge, I may present you wherewithall to act it. Oh Gods! (reply'd Phanasder lifting up his Eyes) why doe you give unto Guilt the same expressios with which Innocency should be cloath'd? Then turning them to me, he told me, Artavasdes, thou wilt not then by ending of my Torments shew me thou hast some Pitty if not Freindship for me. No, (I reply'd) for should I so put a period to yours; I should create in my selfe greater than I can extinguish in you. Remember then (he reply'd) than there being noe way to end those I grone vnder but by my Death, or thine, that denying me the former thou necessitats't me therby as much as by thy Crymes, unto the latter, which I will performe, though thou shouldst conceale thy selfe in that heart, which thou valu'st more than thine owne; Then turning about his Horse, he thrust himselfe into the Wood full speed, my pitty at his Condition not being greater, than my ignorance of what created it, I follow'd him, to learne what he (had twice deny'd me, &) when I found I could not overtake him, I indeavour'd to make my voyce doe it, which was so farre from retarding, that it did but hasten his course, so that I soone lost sight of him, yet for above fower Furlongs I follow'd by the Tract of his Horse, but then mine began to faint, and suddenly after fell dead vnder me, by a deepe wound he had receiv'd in the fight, and which my earnest prosecution of Phanasder made me not observe. 'Twas there after my heate was mittigated that I began to finde how much the Gods tooke delight to torment me; And after I had a litle reflected on those strange accidents which had arriu'd me in so short a space, I could not abstaine from saying, Great Gods! was it not enough Misery for the vnfortunat Artavasdes to lose his Princesse, but you must add vnto it, the loseing of his Freind? and were not both those losses sufficient to glutt your hatred, but that you must give me resolution and fortitude to survive them? Ah cruell Powres, did you give me Innocency but by punishing it as guilt, to change mine into it?  & are you so solicitous to make me blaspheame, that you make Innocence vnfortunate, to invite me to it? But (I continu'd after a short silence) if I have offended you, let the world reade my Sinn in my punnishment, but since I have not offended either Altezeera, or Phanasder, why would you induce the World to beleive I have, by making them my Persecutors? 'Twas with as many extravagant Reasonings as these that I fedd my despaire, and my Rage not permiting me to rest, I found my selfe out of the wood, as soone as I remember'd I had bin in it, and seeing a village not farr off, I went thither, where having hir'd a Horse, I prosecuted that journy Phanasders strange distemper had interrupted. As soone as I came into my Inn, I found, that Falintus & Philanax (having mett with no obstructions) were gotten thither before me, from whome I was inform'd, that though they could not finde by any Intelligence they had learnt, that my being in Armenia nor my having bin at Evaxes Castle were knowne, yet they had cause to beleive both were, for Crassolis that Morning was retir'd from the Court; neither could they any more discover the cause of his departure, than the place of his retreate, so that Falintus told me, I might be confident Artabazus would not deny me Iustice for my Fathers Murther, since Crassolis durst not expect the event; but his advice was, since the Crimminall was fledd, I should not then implore a Revenge, which his concealment would frustrate, and which if I did not then demand, it might induce Crassolis to thinke his owne Guilt, only not my knowledge of it, made him flye, and in that Faith he might returne, which as soone as he did, then was the tyme of demanding Iustice; for the giveing of it then would give me revenge with it, and to implore it now, were absolutly to misse of the latter, by a concession of the former, since to condemne him, were but giveing him advice to secure himselfe. These Reasons since I could not suspect, either them or the Author of them, I determin'd to obey, I then told Falintus, what as vnfortunate, as strange an accident had arriv'd me with Phanasder, which he admir'd at asmuch as he was ignorant of the cause, and told me. This Morning Sir I met him comeing from the Princesse Theoxcena's Appartment, and with a Countenance whose disorder he could not conceale; after he had by some short embraces and expressions congratulated my happy returne, he then precipitatly ask't me where you were, for he had some businesse of high concearne to comunicate unto you. I told him that both Philanax, and I, continu'd at Court purposely to learne,  & send you things of that quality, & that if he were over harrast with his late journy, & that he would acquaint me with the secret, I would overtake you that Night, and stopp you till his comeing. To this Phanasder reply'd, that he would trust me with his heart, but that the businesse he had with you was of a nature which would lose its virtue if it were deliver'd you by any but himselfe, and therfore he passionatly conjur'd me to let him knowe which way you had tooke, & to pardon a silence which I could not condemne, when I should be instructed in the cause. I did therefore satisfy both his requests, and 'twas by my information that he so vnfortunatly found you out, But could not you Sir (continu'd Falincus) in his Passion, collect somthing which might tell you what created it? No (I reply'd) though by reitterated intreaties I conjur'd him to tell it me, and with faithfull promises, if I were guilty, to contribut to, and not oppose his Revenge, but all was in vaine, and I could collect nothing but that he was as confident I was Crimminall, as I am, that I am not. The best part of the Night wee entertain'd our selves in resembling discourses, which at length I put a period to, by conjureing Falintus to continue about the Court, to endeavour to learne the cause of Phanasders change, that though his carriage rende'rd him not absolutly worthy my care, yet thinking the knowledge of his error would not only punish the criminall, but restore unto me the gallant Phanasder, I was passionatly concearn'd therein; That he would enquire after Crassolis, & send me constant Intelligence to a solitude neere Satala, which I had elected in a great measure by his perswasions and reasons, & where I would passe away the Reliques of my Melancholly, and Love. Falintus would have accompany'd me thither, which I absolutely declin'd, & then he having as absolutely promis'd to obey my former requstes, the next Morning we separated our selves, he taking the way to the Court, and I to thospia, where I intended to visit Lyndesia, before I secluded my selfe from the World. There that excellent Woman gave me such admirable Reason, for the suppressing of my Passion, that I must have bin entirely divested of the former, had I not divested my selfe of the latter, which whilst I did not (for I shall not scruple to confesse, that somtymes I made a start into Love) by the reflection on Lyndesia's reasoning, I acknowledg'd my selfe voyde of any, & knowing my selfe to be so, I excus'd my fault, in the knowledge of my condition: Neither did shee only give me Precepts, but Example against the Assaults of Fortune & what shee would have had me practice in Altezeera's case, shee did in hirselfe Anexanders, though in it shee found so litle Reason to fortify hir selfe with, that perhapps that was the only reason with which shee did it; neither did hir calmenesse in so high an Essay, appeare any thing like insensibility, no, it shew'd its cause in its effect, & the Gods did in some degree repaire hir losse, by making it so largely evidece hir virtue; I have bin (continu'd Artavasdes) somwhat the more particular in Lyndesia's Caracter, because hir perfections are of a resembling quality, as also to oppose a maxime as absur'd as common, which is, the declining the prayse of those to whome we have a neere Relation, whereas those that have not any, can hardly make an exact Caracter, & by this lowe Rule, the cheif, if not the only way by which we must attaine to the knowledge of a perfection, must be the Argument for not publishing it. I continu'd two dayes at Thospia with Lyndesia, from whose actions, aswell as words, I receiv'd that consolation, I fear'd shee would have needed. The third day I tooke my leave, and desir'd hir to continue Vdozia where I had given hir an absolute Power, not only as it was a place neere which I intended to reside, but being on the Frontiers, Ventidius, (whose Passion I had not only at large acquainted hir with, but made hir approve) upon the making his Addresses to Vdozia, might not be necessitated to put himselfe in any hazard, by comeing vnaccompanyed, or Armenia, by comeing with an Army. This Lyndesia having gravnted, I left Thospia, and in Twelue dayes came to my litle retirment, where retaining none but Philanax with me, and two or three Servants for necessary uses I began to make a firce Warre against my Passion, & my saddnesse, which I found were Enemyes, easier to be conquer'd than extirpated, and like some barbarous People were invisible when any power was extant to oppose them, but when that Power appear'd no more, they instantly did, and assum'd as high a Soveraignty as if they had bin Conquerors. This made me incessantly continue in Armes, and those I made use of, were the remembrance of the services I had render'd Altezeera, of hir vowes, and of hir Inconstancy, for which I found so litle excuse, that what had given the wrong, I thought would also repaire it; A Thousand tymes in this resolution I was goeing to abandon my solitude, and by a publique vndisturb'd serenity evince I robb'd hir of so much of hir Tryumph, as that my sorrow compos'd no part thereof, but alas immediatly I fancy'd Altezeera in all hir Charmes, and captivating my resolution, with the same Eyes with which shee had my liberty, with whose influences, my trayterous fancy so conspir'd, that though I were at too great a distance to receive their reall impressions, yet by that false helper I carr'yd still their effects about me. Never Man endur'd those Torments the miserable Artavasdes did, and his Fate was so particular, that whilst he yet disputed the victory he resented more pregnant sufferings than he could have in the very loseing it; And if mine receiv'd any intermission, 'twas from the visits of Vdozia, in whose sight and conversation I had some good intervalls, which continu'd me in some charity to the Sexe, by receiving from one of it the ease of those paines another had made me resent. 'Twas thus for a long while that I languisht away my tyme, during which I receiu'd frequent and faithfull intelligences from the generous Falintus; His first was, that notwithstanding a scrutinous enquiry  & search, he could never learne either what was the cause of Phanasders change, or what was become of him: That the faire Theoxcena, as Author of, or participater in, his discontents, had retir'd hirselfe either absolutely, or conditionally from the World; & that he was as ignorant of the place of hir retreate, as of what was the occasion of it: That Altezeera had bin solemnly marryed to the Prince of Parthia immediatly after hir arrivall in that Kingdome: And that Crassus had lost his Army, and his Life, in a furious Battell against the Parthians, who had bin assisted by a visible Divinity, that vanisht as soone as did the Romane hopes. These three Intelligences were as sensible unto me, as any others I was capable of, for in the first of them I lost my Freinds, In the second my Mistris, and in the third, my hopes of revenging or repairing that losse. I will passe over the many sighes & complaints I gave to those accessions of sorrow, to let you know, that the solitude which Reason could not make me abandon, Freindship did: For I receiv'd an Advice from Vdozia, That Ventidius with an Army (as formidable from the Nation, as the Numbers which compos'd it) had already crost the Hellespont, and was so farre advanc't into the lesser Asia, that if I intended, to see him before he enter'd Armenia, I could not any longer delay my visit; This Allarme I joyfully receiu'd, and in some degree I was reconcil'd to the Gods, who though they had deny'd me the establishment of my owne felicity, had yet blest me with the power of setling my Freinds. In two dayes I had fitted my selfe to leave my retirement, which I could not doe without some reluctancy, as an acknowledgement of those vninterrupted houers of Melancholly I had spent in it; My first journy was to Satala, where having form'd my Equipage, and receiv'd those reitterated assurances from Vdozia, which were to settle Ventidius's and my felicity, I crost the Mountaine Scordiscus which separats Armenia from Cilicia, and in two dayes after came to Tharsus, the Metropolis of that Province, where Ventidius then lay, who having advertisment of my arrivall, drew out all his Army (which consisted of 50000 naturall Italians) into a large Plaine on the East side of the Citty, where he receiv'd me with a Million of Embraces at the head of them,  & where I found nothing more worthy admiration than the Forces, but their Generall. 'Twas at this first meeting (after I had saluted all the Roman Tribunes) and as we were rideing to Tharsus that he told me. If (my deare Artavasdes) I have so long abstain'd from acknowledgeing Vdozia's victory at hir Feete, 'twas only to evince my respect equall to my Passion, and not to declare my selfe hir Subject 'till I presented hir with an Army that might make those so by hir Commands, which were vnworthy to be so by hir sight; The Gods know how just this Duty is, by esteeming it fitter to abandon their Rome in Crassus's defeate, than that I should be any longer suspended from paying it; Yes (my Attavasdes) I am now come to implore that Assistance you have so generously promis'd me, and by which if I am victorious, I shall no more feare any other Conquests, than desire them. He told me many as passionat words as these,  & deliver'd them in an accent which was so full of grace & concerne, that I easily perceiv'd what inspir'd them, & from whence they came: Ventidius had no sooner ended speaking than I told him. If after those Miseries the cruell Gods have impos'd on me I have found sufficient fortitude to out-live them, I deriv'd it principally, perhaps intirely, from my concearnes in the generous Ventidius, and if since my Torments began I have relisht any thing of joy; I attest the Gods, 'twas only by reflecting on my successe for him, which has bin as proportionate to my desires, as to his. Yes (my Ventidius) Vdozia setts that value on you which you have ambition'd, and if by my imperfect Caracter shee has assum'd such an esteeme of you, judge then what it will rise unto, when shee see's your Person, and has heard the charmes of your conversation? Ah Artavasdes (said Ventidius) I apprehend you have bin so much more my Freind than Nature and Education has, that to continue in the blessing of hir esteeme, I must live in it by your Caracter, and to continue that felicity, I must deny my selfe the other of seeing hir. If this (I reply'd) be your feares; you have not many houres travell to cleare them, but certainly you could not have so good an opinion of Vdozia if you had so ill a one of hir Iudgement. 'Twas in such discourses as these that we entertain'd one another 'till our entring into Tharsus, where that necessary formall Civility for a while deny'd us a privacy, which, as soone as we enjoy'd, Ventidius employ'd a parte of it to tell me those admirable vicissitudes of the Roman State, in the victories and Death of Iulius Caesar, which latter though the Conspirators beleiv'd would either have restor'd the Roman liberty or made them Lords of it, yet they had fail'd of both, and the event did manifest there was more difficulty in making the Romans assume their Freedome than there had bin in making them lay it downe. That the Gods had evinc't how they disrelisht the spilling of that great Mans Blood, not only by depriving the Actors in it of that end they promis'd themselves, but by bringing all those to an vntimely Death which had brought Caesar to one. He further acquainted me how that after the defeate & Death of Crassus, he found little oppsition to be Generall in his steed, and as litle to raise an Army to revenge the Roman Honor and losse, and though the Command was of a Quality which might have rais'd desires of possessing it in the most recluse Spirits, yet he had only sought and embrac't it, but to have a handsomer way to make his Addresses, and a more powerfull one, to revenge my wrongs; That therefore he had procur'd from Marke Anthony, Octavius Caesar; and Lepidus (who then compos'd the second Triumvirate) a full liberty not only to revenge on Artabazus the violating of that League Annexander had concluded with the People of Rome, but also if he esteem'd it requisite, to make that Revenge a Dethroning of him, & establishing in his Roome such an Armenian Prince as he was confident would have honesty enough to value that virtue above Interest: That this power he had the more easily obtain'd because the Princesse Altezeera by marrying Pacorus had declar'd hirselfe asmuch an Enemy to Rome as to me, and being the apparent Successor of Armenia, the Senate were justly jealouse of vniting that Crowne with the Parthian: That too he had the earnestlyer ambition'd this, because that forfeicture of Artabazus's gave me a right to Armenia by my Birth, which a Roman Army would so confirme, that he would finde in injuring Artavasdes, he had asmuch wrong'd his Interest as his Honesty. The Gods forbid (I reply'd, interrupting him) that you should employ your Armes so vnjustly, & that I should for my Kings Crimes, doe any thing but lament them; besides (generous Ventidius) had Artabazus forfeicted his Right (which I know he cannot, being answerable for his actions to none but the Gods) yet still the Princesse Altezeera has a Title as firme, as my resolution not to oppose it; For to be Wife to Pacorus & Freind to Rome, are not inconsistent; & wee have examples, that the conjugall and Regall Rights, are not so incompatible but they may joyntly subsist; But were they not; I am so farre from divesting hir of Empire that had I that of the World, I would prostrate it as I did my Liberty at hir Feete, & esteeme the Title of hir Subject, and the visible effects of so transcendent a virtue & Government, a farre higher satisfaction than to take the Raines of it into my owne hands: That since I had neither the Power nor the Will any other way to revenge my selfe on the faire Altezeera than by manifesting my Innocency, I was confident the declining so large an Empire to maintaine hir right after such sensible injuries, would fully doe it; & the knowledge of hir fault would in some degree repaire it. I further implor'd Ventidius, that the Armenians for Vdozia's sake, might avoyde a storme, which perhaps their King had deservedly drawn upon them, & that the greater his Title was to their destruction, the greater would that Mercy appeare which declin'd acting it. I too-well observe (Ventidius reply'd) that you are borne vnder a Monarchy by giving Sanctuary to the offence, in the Title of the offendor, and making his quality annihilate his Crymes, which aggravates them; for faults in Kings are more vnpardonable than in others, since they have so great influence over all, and since those can hardly punnish offences which comit them: Wee that are Romans allow no Sanctuary but to virtue, & esteeme it too-troublesome a respect to put the Gods to punish, what we our selves have the Power: Besides, their goodnesse is so transcendent, that 'tis often an invitation to Princes and Magistrates to rely on it; but they seldome doe erre when the punishment and the Sinn are inseparable, and when those they wrong are to be their Iudges: That Kings doe publish they are to give an accompt of their actions to none but the Gods, is not a greater Tyranny in them, than imbecility in such as either beleive, or graunt it. The giving them that power, is to encourage them to be Tyrants, by having no obligation on them not to be so, but what they impose on themselves; Whereas wee Romans, though we leave our Governors a latitude to shew they are virtuous; yet we also leave our selves one to punish them, if they prove otherwise; & indeed wise Men will avoyd such temptaions, and perhaps few that are so will give it them; Besides, you that subject your selves to a successive Monarchy, are tyde to your Rulers as to your Fate, you must submit to the bad aswell as to the good; whereas we are confin'd to outs but as to our Cloathes, if they are sully'd, vnfitt or worne out, wee make our selves new ones: You at best have but the bare word of a Woman for your Governours, wee the word of virtue for ours: You by making blood a sufficient Title to rule, invite them to dullnesse and vice; Wee by making desert the way unto it; necessitate them to virtue, and Merit; you by trusting the Power to one runn a hazard which wee avoyd, for there needs but imbecility, or corruption in One, to ruine All, but we trusting to divers, many a One must be weake, & perfidious, to create our misfortunes; and none being absolute, 'tis Reason, & not Power, which formes our results and actions. To omit many other preheminencies, Comon-wealths are not subject to personall vices, as Lust, Avarice, Luxury, Inconstancy and Cruelty. That there is (I reply'd) a necessity of a Supreame power in all Governments to whome finall appeales and resolutions are to be left (to avoyd perpetuall disputes and vncertainties) is not more true, than that Power is absolutely best invested in a Monarch; which to evince, I shall desire you but to reflect on the greatest States & Empires that were, or are, and you shall finde, 'twas from the virtue of one Man they had their Beginning or Lawes. Moses made those of the Iewes; Lycurgus those of Sparta; Solon those of Athens (though indeed of short duration) Nimrod the Empire of Babilon, Arsaces that of the Parthians; Alexander that of the Grecians; Cyrus that of the Persians; and to omitt many others, Romulus that of Rome; & 'tis a Maxime as generall as true, That what creates, is the best to perfect & preserve. Neither when Monarchy was banisht from Rome, was there any mutation in the monarchicall Lawes, but the change of Perpetuall Kings into annuall Consulls: 'Tis too, no small manifestation that Monarchy is the best forme, seeing 'tis the Government of Heaven: Besides, that which is the most desirable and the seldomest found in Aristocracies, Oligarchies, and Democracyes, is almost inseparable from Monarchy, which is, an internall quiet that proceeds from a generall submission to one Authority, which is that, which gives a Power and ability to defend or enlarge a State; Whereas in Republiques the greatest and comonest ayme is to make many an Individuall what a King is allreaddy; or else eternall differences betweene the Nobility and People, or among each other, if either has supprest the other: Besides in a Comon-wealth a Man is seldom famous without Envy, nor lov'd without Feare, those very actions which evince him to be capable of serveing a state, rendering it dangerous for that State to be served by him; so that to be esteemed well, one must not deserve too-well, and a great Merit is as usuall a Title to ruine or Banishment, as it ought to be to Reward. But in Monarchies, the Prince is above those feares, and consequently not only leaves a latitude, but gives an invitation to the highest merits and Actions, by rendring them acceptable, and not dangerous duties; it is evident also that there ought to be a supreame above the Law, for what invitation have those to preserve That, without which they can neither comit an offence, nor deserve a Punishment; whereas a Monarch, besides the obligation of Trust, the Lawes are not only that which gives him the Power, but that too which maintaines him in it, by being as it were, his Guard, in making Death the Reward of all attempts against his Person, or Authority; so that he is likelier to preserve the Lawes which receives a benefit by them, than he which can receive no prejudice but from them; & to give the power to those who must live vnder it, is in effect to invite them to favour themselves; To let the People too, be Iudges whether the dispencers of the Law doe it equally, is to give them a Latitude to destroy those Lawes which should govern them; since the greater parte of People conclude the lesse, and the greater parte of all Nations are the worst. Besides it makes a Iudge apprehensive to distribute the Lawes without partiality, when those he gives his Sentence upon, are those who must pronouce his, and so, often, out of hope of a mutuall lenity, mutually prove vnjust; but it may be objected, the People will not repine at the executing those Lawes to which they have assented, or which they themselves have constituted; To this I answer, Those Lawes which are propos'd, are commonly so equall in themselves, that none can decline his Assent unto them, without publishing he intends to violate them, which were an antedated folly no rationall Creature would be guilty of; & those too, which give their votes to the framing of Lawes, are then comonly cleere of those Crimes, which those Lawes are made against; So that what they assent unto at first out of shame, or innocence, when yet they incurre the penalty of those institutions, they wish they never had bin made; and indeed the People are farre better pleas'd to make severe Lawes, than to have them obseru'd; since the first of these is an excellent demonstration of their goodnesse, and their vnalterable resolution of continuing it; and in the last, they cannot divest themselves of Nature; which violently inclines all men to a selfe- preservation, as the highest, & first principle. To let the supreame Trustees of the People be subject to be call'd unto accompt, is the certain'st way to make them Tyrants, since the apprehension of punishment, induces all Men to act what may secure them from it; and if they have done any thing amisse, either by designe, frailty, or ignorance, it invites them to invest themselves with a Power which may defend them from Ruine, and thereby, the acting of one Injustice, renders the acting of a greater necessary; as Theeues, who out of apprehension of having their Theft reveal'd and punisht, add vnto it Murther; And as your Cateline, who told his Souldiers, that the ills they had done, could not be secur'd but by acting greater: Whereas the Monarch being above those apprehensions, if he commit a fault he needs not runn into that necessary wickednesse, but is rather oblig'd by so noble a priviledge, to repaire it by some generous actions, which may render him worthy of it. Besides 'tis seldome that a Comon-wealth is gratefull to a deserving Man, which is not only a large deterring of any from being so, but also as large an invitation if he be so, to pay himselfe; was there ever a People more beholding to Men than the Romans were to Camillus, and Publius Cornelius Scipio; the first for restoring the Roman State to the Roman People, when not only in all probability he might have made himselfe Lord of it, but even when they were so lowe reduced, that there were hardly enough Senators left to give him a Comission to serve them, and when he had bin us'd at a rate, which might have clouded his Ambition with the name of a just Revenge; And the last of these, for not only preserving the Roman State, but by adding to it as great a one; yet their returnes were such, that if a Stranger had but known their usage, & not their actions, he would have esteem'd them the Destroyers, not the Restorers of their Country. These two are not the only, though the most famous examples; Marcus Livius, Caius Martius Coriolanus, Lucius Emilius, the Asiattick Scipio, and such a vaste Catalogue of others, that 'twere much the more difficult taske to name who they were vngratfull unto, than to whome they were not. Neither is this vice the appropriate one to the Re-publique of Rome, but common to that Government. The Syracusians were the like to Dion, and Hermocrates; The Spartans to Agis, and parte of his family; and as some have thought to Lycurgus. The Lacedomonians to Pansanius his first virtues, and victoryes; which, it may be, made him thinke, vice was the virtue, by their ingratitude to the Latter; and the Athenians to Themistocles, Pericles, Cimon, Alcibiades, Aristides, Phocion and Miltiades. Doubtlesse the example of some of these inspir'd Marius and Sylla with those designes of rewarding themselves, and of making the People gratefull against their wills. And what King from Romulus to Lucius Tarquin, did ever spill so much Roman blood, and fil'd Rome with such disorders, as those two did in disputeing for that Title; Neither did all the Kings empty so many Roman veynes to maintaine their Name, as Caesar did to restore it, and Pompey to hinder it. Is it not then irrationall to spend more in resisting Monarchy, than can be lost by it? The same Caesar doth both wayes evince this Truth, for 'till he wonne the Crowne the stormes were not greater, than the calmes after it; Besides, what yon told me of the Romans being now vnder a Triple Monarchy (for so I accompt the Triumvirat) palpalpably manifests, that that forme of Government they have found by experience is the most perfect; for the Conspirators by killing of Caesar, so cleerly left them their voyces, that their election of Monarchy evinces, 'tis their choyce, and not their constraint. Their Banishment of the Tarquins was evidently asmuch an action of choller, as this of premeditation, so that I may say they did then but lose their way into Aristocracy. If too the Roman actions, are to be credited before their professions, wee finde they are absolutly convinc't that the Government of One, is the best; for seldome was there any thing of danger in the Comon- wealth, but they immediatly created a Dictator, who is an absolute Monarch for the tyme being, and to whome the very Senate, and People, doe absolutly resigne themselves; as appeares by Camillus, who coming to releive Rome, as shee had agreed for, and was paying for his Liberty to Brennus King of the Gaules, he brake off the Bargaine; and that Barbarous Prince taxing him for violating an Agreement made by his Superiors, he reply'd, That being Dictator he had none, but the Gods, & acted accordingly & to evince 'twas the Truth, and not the Successe which made the Romans approve of Camillus reply, Quintus Cincinnatus when Dictator, in that Quality, not only degraded Minutius from his Consulship, but constraines him to be a Leiutenant over those Legions, the Equians had worsted vnder his Comand. Five tymes was that great Camillus in resembling dangers, created Dictator, and I beleive his, and Cincinnatus happy conduct, gave the People no ill relish of Monarchicall Government. The Military Tribunes, and Decemvirs, though instituted by the People, were of no constant, or long duration, as alwayes finding that Government which was farthest from Monarchy, the most confus'd; This made the Consulary Dignitie, and Dictatorship, of longest continuance. Two illustrations of this are very pregnant; The first was in the Institution of the Dictatorship, which proceeded from the Revolt of the Verans, and and Fidenates, who having cutt in peices a Collony of the Romans, and they desireing Revenge, Created fower Tribunes with Consuler Authority, and sent three of them to this Warre, who thorough Ambitio and variance, did nothing considerable, but that they did nothing which was so; Vpon which the Romans finding the error of this Democraticall Generallship, immediatly created Mamercus Dictator, who almost as immediatly reveng'd their losses, & wrongs. The other is, of Quintus and Agrippa, who being both sent against the Equians, the latter was so much a Freind to Truth above Ambition, that he desir'd Quintus might goe alone, since no great affaires could ever be perform'd without the Soveraigne Authority were invested in one; And if you observe it, Rome never obtain'd such Victories as vnder a single Generall, & never receiu'd such losses as vnder a Plural, which first as cleerly appeares, besides those famous Examples of Camillus and Scipio, in Posthumius at the Battell of Regillus; in Cincinnatus; in Caesar; and in Pompey, who both tryumph'd over Europe, Asia and Affrick; the latter also being chosen single to defend the Roman Liberty, when Consulls were not only in being, but in Authority; as the last does, in the Examples of Fabius the Great & Minutius; in Varro and Paulus Emilius, at that fatall Battell of Cannes; in Marcellus & Crispinus; in Gellius & Lentulus; and to omit many others, so recently in Brutus & Cassius; Neither has this bin a particular Fate to the Roman State, but to all others who have practic'd the like Discipline; As the Carthaginians, when Hanno & Bomilcar comanded against the Tyrant Agathocles; To Asdruball and Syphaxe when they Commanded against Scipio; To the Athenians in the Sicilian Warre, first vnder Nicias & Alcibiades, who did nothing joyntly, and all things assunder (As in discourse two Negatiues make one Affirmatiue; so in Warre two good Generalls makes one ill one) Afterwards in the same Country vnder Nicias & Demonstenes; & the State of Athens obtaining that famous Victory of Marathon, must not be attributed to the Tenn Generalls, but to the Tenn Generalls having the Iudgement which the Athenians wanted, of giving the sole power to the only Miltiades. The same misfortune attended Antiochus Fleete, when joyntly commanded by Polinus, and Hanniball, against the Romans, which latter found sufficiently the obstruction of a Common-wealth, the Hannoan Faction in Carthage fighting against him, more than the Romans in Italy; and had he bin King of Carthage, he had doubtlesse bin the like of Rome; So that if Rome affect an Aristocracy, 'tis perhaps more out of Gratitude than Reason; neither can I omit (to illustrate what I afirme) two remarkable Adventures; The first, when the Latins came to reinvest Lucius Tarquin, in his Throne, the Romans beleiving nothing could oppose a Monarch, but a Monarchicall Generall, gave the sole comand of that great Day to Posthumius, who gave them the victory. The other was when Torquatus, and Decius were Consulls, and faught a furious Battell against the same People, the latter, to obtaine the Victory, devoted himselfe to a voluntary Death, as if the Gods had destin'd it to a Monarchicall Generallship, & deny'd it to a Democratticall. Besides, in Comon-welths, the giving of None the superiority, gives all a desire of it, and makes that every ones hope, by being no bodies possession; so that those Abilities, and Courages which in a Monarchy manifest & vent themselvs, for the increaseing the State, in other Governments, are imploy'd to possesse it; I confesse indeed that there must be Many weake or Perfidious to ruine a Common-wealth, but then there needs but One able & honest to preserve a Kingdome; which proves, that to make your happinesse, you must have Many blest with those virtues, which One needs but have, to make ours; So that, as much as 'tis more likely to have One able and Honest man then Many, so much 'tis more likely that Monarchy should be a better Government then a Republique. Neither are Common-welths free from personall faults, for never was any King more cruell, avaritious, or inconstant than Athens, and Carthage; and though the Body of the People are exempt from some particular vices, only because they are inconsistent with Many, and inherent to One, or perhaps their not knowing them, or not having the power, and meanes to act them, yet those that Governe, being particulars, are not at all free from them; and that which was the pretence of depressing Monarchy in Rome, was the reall Cause of depressing the Decemvirs, for 'twas but the Sonne of the King acted the Rape on Lucretia, but 'twas Appius Clodius in Person, and a Decenwir that would have acted that of Virginia, had not hir Death releiv'd hir misfortune. It was (doubtlesse) too, the Iustice of the Gods to shew the People that Sinn in a Governor, which they had so severely Punnisht but in a Governors Sonne. As to our being necessitated to take a Womans word for our Kings, if there be any misfortune in it, you must except not against us, but the Gods, who have made them witnesses in their owne Cause; yet that great Trust invites them to a proportionate virtue, and 'tis also the only proofe you have at Rome, of that so ador'd Title of Patritian. That there is (Ventidius reply'd) a Necessity of a Power to which All Finall Appeales ought to be made, cannot be a Greater Truth, than it is, that That Power is best plac'd in the Representatives of the People, since what ever can be say'd, for the having it in a King, can be say'd for the having it in Those Representatives, and much more also: For besides the high Obligation of Trust, which is Comon to both, and indeed the Cheife, if not the Only upon Kings (at least if wee Creddit what they say, That they are accountable to none but the Gods) That Authority is likelier to be carefull in Making, and maintaining of Lawes to which They, and their Posterities must submitt, Then that Authority which is so farre from receiving a Prejudice by Ill Lawes, that therby it receives an Advantage; For the lesse the People have, the More the King hath. Neither can the Law, be more the Monarchs Guard, then it is the Peoples; for as a King owes All he hath to the being Aboue the Law, so the People owe All they have to their being vnder it; so that Both Deriveing, Both their All's from that Principle, 'tis likely the concerne for maintaining it wilbe Equall; For though a King may Loose more in Quality then any Individuall in a Common wealth, yet he cannot loose more in Quantity; For the greatest looser, never knew a Degree beyond, All; where All is lost, the Disproportion, may be in the loosing, but cannot be in the Losse. Neither has the Aspireing of any Individuall, more or oftner, involu'd Common-wealths in Warre, then the same Passion, in Subjects or next Successors, has involu'd Kingdomes; so that that Fault is not produc'd by the ill Constitution of that Government, but by the Ill Inelynations of some vnder it; For where Ambition does Raigne, those Desire to doe so who are possest by it, vnder either Government. And if those Ills are vnlikest to be attempted, or acted, which are likest to meete with most opposition, then Doubtlesse the Designe of Vsurping the Soveraignty, is lesse like to be vndertooke, vnder the Government of a Common-wealth, then vnder that of a Monarch; for if the intended Vsurper have successe against the Forces of a King, he findes the People prepar'd to embrace that forme of Regiment; but though he have successe against the Forces of a Common-wealth, he will finde a new Difficulty, in constrayning the People to submit to Monarchy; in one He is to Distroy but the Governor, but in in the other, the Governours & Government; The People too are much more apt to fight in Defence of Both of those, then in Defence of One, espetially their owne concernment being in the Last, and but their Rulers in the First. Besides, Reason (the Health of the Minde) is much more satisfy'd the Possessor of it, should acquiess in the Certainty of having no Superiour, then run a hazard of That, to have noe Equall; so that 'tis the Rationall part of man, which keepes him to the Government of a Common-wealth, and the Passionate only which makes him an Enemy to it; which evinces that asmuch as 'tis Likelyer that Reason should actuate Rationall Creatures than Passion, so much 'tis likelyer that a Common-wealth should be Quiet, then Disturb'd. I confesse indeed that you neede but One exactly Wise, & Honest to make your Government Happy, and that wee neede Many to make ours so, yet 'tis much more Probable that Choyce should finde Many Wise, & Honest, then that Nature, or Education should alwayes make the Eldest of One Family to be so; To which be Pleased to Remember, the Discovery of your Governour's Crymes, creates the Trouble; but the Discovery of ours, ends it. I acknowledge Common-wealths have bin Vngratefull to Deserveing Men, but I cannot acknowledge, nor can you I am Confident Proove, that there having bin so, proceeded from their Forme of Government; But because you have instanc'd some Examples of their Ingratitude, least thereby you would cast that Aspertion on the Government which is due but to the Governours, I will name some Celebrated Kings who have bin guilty of the like Cryme; that either thereby you may acknowledge the Error of such a misdistinguishing, or else that I may make use of it to retort it on you, and evidence by your owne Arguing that if the Faults of Governours must be ascribed to the Regiment; Monarchys therein are equall with Comon-wealths. The first Instances, shalbe in two Kings of the Iewes (The Father & the Sonne) whose Subjects doe Glory in being (as it were) the Meniall Servants of the God they Worship, & to owe the Institution, & Progresse of their Government to Miracles, Their Names are David and Solomon; The one signall for the Sword of Warre, the other for the Sword of Peace; The first a Man after their Deities owne Heart, and the last a Tipe of that Great Prince, their Prophets have so often foretold, and they so certainly and intently expect; yet the former made one of his Last injunctions to his Sonne, the not Permiting Ioab's Hory Head to goe downe in Peace into the Grave; Ioab, who (in effect) made David King, when he was not, and kept him King, when he was; who would not take a Towne 'till he came, that he might have the Honnour as well as benefit of Successe; and Solomon so well obay'd his King, or rather so truly Acted that Part, that Ioab's Life which deseru'd an Altar, could not be secured even in the Embraceing of one, but was there offer'd as a Sacrifice, to the obedience (at least) of one of his Kings, & to the Iealousie of another; Some faults overballanceing Many Services; the Former writ in his Kings Heart, the Latter in the Aire. An other Instance is in Alexander Surnamed the Great, as much perhaps for his Cruelty as Successe; Calistines more Iustly Famous then him, Died by him; Clytus bolder for his King, then to Him, yet did the Like; Parmenio, without whome He hardly got a Victory & with whome He never lost One had the like Fate. In a Word this King Disstroy'd more Gallant Men of his Freinds, then of his Enemies. But yet since you have mentioned him for the Founder of so Great an Empire, as the Grecian, I shall Desire you to observe who 'twas he esteem'd fittest to Governe, & when it was he made that Declaration, or rather Law; It was when Death was forceing him from his Empire, and when his Queene Roxana, was ready to present him with a Successor to it; Yet even then he order'd, and seal'd it with his last Breath, that the Worthyest only should beare That Title; evenceing thereby, that He Alone was next to the Crown, that was so to him in Vertue, not in Blood; He found he should injure Truth, more then his Posterity, if he allowed not Vertue the Highest, nay the only Gitle to Government. An Action so every way Excellent, that if any thing could, this might have cleer'd his Fame from those staynes, cast upon it, by the blood of Calistines; who, had he liv'd vnder a Common-wealth, the Sincerity of his Heart, and the Eloquence of his Tongue, had ingag'd him in noe more Danger then Cato's, & Cicero's did them whilst vnder that Regiment; Their words & Actions needing no Pardon vnder a Common-wealth, and finding none vnder a Monarchy; the first dying, in apprehension Caesar had too much Clemency, and the Last finding Antony had too litle. Nor can you say it is peculiar to Common-wealths to be vngratefull to their Soldiery were there no more to Illustrate the Contrary then the Preceding Examples in the Iudaick, and Grecian Empire, But the Truth is all Authorities have bin shy of their Souldiery, for since the Sword hath introduced Most Governments, since it does maintaine All, & since it only can Ruin Any Government, 'tis not so strange that Rulers are Iellous of those which weare it, as it would be, if they were not. As to what is so much insisted upon, & so often mention'd of Prescription by Time to prove a Government Iust; That, to any Rationall Person will appeare, is not to vpholde Truth, but Power, which if Illigittimately acquired, the Longer the Possession lasts, the greater the Injustice is, for perseverance in Ill, in any other Case, never turn'd Ill into Good, so that in this, 'tis graunted as a Convenyence, rather than a Right; Besides, if any Person vnder any Gouernment, Declare he has a Will to Distroy it, he thereby gives that Government the Right to Distroy him; If then a VVill in any particular to subvert a Government, merits such a punnishment, Probably that Government will beleeve a Power to Doe it, Deserves as much, for the Will in an Individuall of Distroying the Authority he is vnder, never Created the Power, but the Power hath often Created the Will; so that if the Lesser Danger is esteemed Iustly Punnishable, you may thereby Iudge what is concluded of the greater. It hath bin also, not only the Maxime, but the Practice of many Kings & Common-wealths, to make a Warre & seeke the Depression of a Neighbour State, only because that State was increasing to a Greatnesse which might Depresse Theirs, and this, because a preventative Care, has bin alowed of as a lust one; so that if States, towards the Preventing of a Reall or Immaginary Danger; from Those They have noe Authority over; from Those which have not then the Power to Hurt them; & from Those which perhaps may never have the Will, & who have not so much towards the ingendring of it as the Power, may Iusty according to the Principles of Safety & Government (the last being Cheifily establisht for the first) even by a Hazardous VVarre suppresse such, how much more will they beleive it lust, to suppresse Those, from whome a neerer and Pregnantter Iealousie doth arise, and where the safety that Performance Presents & ascertaynes is not Deriu'd from the Rules of Policy, which makes Successe, Iustice, but is Deriu'd from the Rules of Authority, which makes the Safety of the People, the supreamest Law, and those the best, if not the Only Iudges of that Safety, who are by the People entrusted with it: To all which may be added, that Maxime as Generall, as Wicked, & at Least as Vsuall in Monarchyes as Comon-wealths; To Hate what They Feare, and to Depresse what they Hate. These, and a Thronge of such other Arguings, the Craft or rather Wickednesse of Governours vnder either Regiment, have establisht as Principles to Distroy the Generousest Caling; A Caling without which They could doe Nothing, and for which they seldome doe Any thing; Somtimes they make the Prosperity of it necessary to the existece of a State, & somtimes the Distruction of it, as Necessary; sometimes They say it hinders or Revenges opression; & sometimes it invites, & continues it; sometimes They make it a Scaffold, to raise their Sructure to the Cloudes; then use it like a Scaffold & lay it in the Duste. These last words I speake to evince the most. Noble is the most Vnfortvnate Profession, it sowes Merit, & Reapes ingratitude, yet the knowledge of the Last, has never firighted the Generous followers of it, from the First; perhaps to prove, that what would Deter in all other Professions, is the Incouragement of Theirs; and that True Virtue, vnlike materiall Things, the lesse 'tis fedd, the Larger it groes. I hope by this time you are satisfyed that Ingratitude to Gallant Men which are Souldiers (for unto such only as I remember you have proved Comon-wealths have bin vngratfull) is not a Sinn inherent to that Government Alone, but vnto All Regiments. I must Confesse, if to Governe Many by One, is good, it is cheifly so in an Army, for not only where the supreame Power is Devided, the affection of the Souldiery is so, & where Faction is, Ruine is not farre off, but also the Greatest actions of Warre, depende so intirely on the imbraceing of oportunities, that whilst Two are Disputeing a Thing, the Time of Acting it is expir'd. Besides, 'tis a Rate Felicity to have Two in supreame Power, so much Freinds to their Duty above their Ambition, as for the First, intirely to silence the Last; And Rarer to have them both blest with what wee Call, Presence of Minde, in the highest, & Presseing'st Dangers, & Actions, & equally invested with it; for if there be but the least Disproportion, in that Essentiall vertue to Generalls, it may be as prejudiciall and Distructive, as if that Difference were in an Extreame. But after All this, I cannot but remember you, that as our Plurall Generallship in Consulls is order'd, where every day One of them Comands in cheife by Turnes; there is litle hazard to the Comon-wealth, and lesse advantage to the Enemyes of it, But because you have Instanced some signall Losses wee have sustayn'd vnder a Double Generallship, least you might too ascribe it to that Forme of Ruleing an Army, I will only Minde you of a Couple of as Emminent Victoryes as ever Rome was Happy in; purchast vnder that sorte of Generallship. The one vnder Marcus Cornelius, and Quintilius Varrus, in a Furious Battell in the County of the Insubrians, where the Carthaginians not only Lost the Victory, but what was more Deplor'd, & more Iustly so, by them, even the Generous Mago, Brother to their great Hanniball both in Blood, and in Virtue; The other, vnder Nero, and Livius, on the Famous Bankes of Metaurus, which River chang'd it's Cullor asmuch with Carthaginian Blood, as ever Aufidus did with Roman; There the Noble Asdruball a true Sonne of Amilcars found his Fate, and the Manes of above fifty thousand Italians, were appeas'd, did resigne ther Solitary walkes, to those Affrycans, which had sent them thither; There the Carthaginian Glory was first Eclipst, & the Roman Prosperity breaking thorough so thick a Cloude of Blood, was never hinder'd from shineing, by an other. Not to Let the Trustees of the People, be call'd by them to an accompt, least thereby, if they have er'd, they should defend their Crymes by Armes, is like killing ones selfe, in Feare of being kill'd; The highest Tyrany, cannot transcend, what this way the People give, to avoyde Tyrany; indeed by such a Donation, Trustee's may be hinder'd from sinning, because they are Elevated above the Law, and where there is noe Law, there is noe Sinne, but the People will not be thereby hinder'd from Ruine, but theirs wilbe rather ascertayn'd, and accellerated; for if both Honesty and Feare, will not deterr Governours from ill Governing, certainly Honesty alone is much vnliklyer to doe it; and if they will be Tyrants against the Law, they wilbe much more above it. 'Tis true the Title of Patritian is in high Veneration at Rome, and one of our Consulls is to be of that order; But yet though wee take the word of a Woman for his being a Patritian, yet wee take the Word of Vertue for his being a Consull; the former makes him Electable, but the latter makes him Elected. But (continu'd Artavasdes) why doe I tell you (& so confuzedly) our opinions, when I only vndertooke to tell you our actions? Not to continue this fault, though we had severall of this Quality, yet I will relate no more of them, to obtaine your pardon for having particulariz'd so many; For conconclusion of all, I told Ventidius, that I was confident he had argued against Monarchy more for his diversion, than as 'twas his judgement, were it for noe other Reason, than that he perswaded me to be a King, which if he esteem'd an ill, I knew he would never have invited me to. If (said Ventidius) I invite you to be a King, 'tis not only that the Armenians have vnreluctantly submitted to that Government, & that you have now every way the justest Title to it (for as to that which you alleadge for Altezeera, that the Tyes of Marriage and Empire are not so inseparable, but shee may severally act the duties of both, I must answer, That where there is on the one side, but a possibility of an advantage, and on the other, an appearance of a vast prejudice, it is inconsistent with the Maximes of State, in expectation of the former, not to prevent the latter) but also that I esteeme no forme of Government so bad, but to change it by a Warre is worse, and that where the Governour is good, the Government wilbe so. At last Ventidius found himselfe in no small perplexity by my vnalterable resolution of vsurping neither upon my Kings, nor my Princesses Rights; for at his departuere from Rome; he had so cleerly satisfy'd the Trivmvirat, and especially Marke Antony (to whome Asia was allotted) that they both had lost theirs, the better to invest me in them, that he much apprehended, if after having demonstrated the danger of Artabazus possessing the Crowne of Armenia, and Altezeeras continuing the right to it, he permitted both, it might prove of ill consequence, and either leave the Roman Lords an impression that he was carelesse of his Trust, or intended some sinister end by so palpable an omission. I must confesse, I found asmuch Reason in his Feares, as in that resolve of mine which created them, but hopeing whist we continu'd at Satala, wee might finde out some expedient for their redresse, or that if wee could not, yet his leaving Armenia in quiet, would not only be more probably, but better effected by the intreaties of a Mistris, than a Freind, I desir'd him to suspend all determinations till we came thither, towards which next morning we intended to goe;  & because Ventidius's leaving his Army (and leaving it too so vnaccompany'd) might not relish of any thing but his care of it, he assembl'd his cheifest Officers, and told them; He was to make a short journy which would exempt them from a long one; that he was hopefull by a private interview with Artabazus, & my Assistance, to make the Armenians more usefull to Rome, than they could expect by an entire Conquest of them; That upon these hopes he must leave them for a few dayes; and that his absence might not retard their martch, he order'd them to continue it 'till they came to Alexandretta, since if there were a necessity of subjecting Armenia in their way to Parthia, their seemingly passing by it, would render Artabazus more secure, and manifest besides, they had a strong beleife of his returning to the Roman Freindship, since in a confidence of it, they had martch'd beside his Kingdome, when they might have invaded it; Ventidius further told them, That the entry into Armenia out of Syria by the Mountaine Imanus, was lesse difficult, than to enter it out of Cilicia by the Mountaine Scordiscus; that 'twas better to trye moderate wayes than extreames; and lastly, they should not move from Alexandretta, where in fowerteene dayes he would not faile to meete them. The deepe respect all Ventidius's Officers pay'd him, and the just opinion they had of his sincerity, & Iudgement, made them perfectly relish this motion, which they had no sooner declar'd, than taking some light Numidian Horse for his Guard, we went to Sattala, with asmuch secrecy, as expedition; whither as soone as we were come, & lighted at Vdozia's Palace I perceiv'd in that great Man's Countenance, & discourse, so sensible an Alteration, that had I not experimentaly knowne those violent emotions which are inseparable from perfect Lovers at their approach neere their Mistrisses, I should have asmuch admir'd at, as I was satisfy'd with them; but these confusions hardly merited that Name, if compar'd to those which succeeded them as soone as he saw Vdozia, who came to meete him in the great Hall of the Palace, and who participated in noe small degree in his disorders; but truely hirs were such, that me thought they perform'd somthing neere to a Miracle, by bringing an accession to hir Beauty, which the generous Roman was so justly ravisht with, that his wonder spoke his Passion more significantly, than any expressions were capable of; but as soone as he found his too-much admiration, and silence, might intrench upon his Civility, he went towards Vdozia with a grace, & Majesty, peculiar to the only Ventidius, & having with a deepe respect kist the bottome of hir Gowne, he told hir, That Freedome Madam which without dispute I have long since yeelded to your Picture, I am now purposely come to Pay to you, whose Power perhaps could not more transcendently manifest it selfe, than by conquering a Romans liberty by a shaddowe, as farre short too of the charmeing substance, as all other reall beauties are short of it. But if the Coppy infus'd a high Flame, judge then what the trenscendent Originall has done, & judge I beseech you Madam of mine, only by that Rule, since nothing can equall the vastnesse of my Passion, but the vastnesse of that Beauty which has created it, which former shalbe as infinite in the duration, as that which gave it a being is in perfection. This Complement could not be suller of Passion, than the answer to it was of Civility, which I passe over as being nothing essentiall to that Story you have enjoyn'd me to tell you; but yet though I omit the particulars of this first interview, I must not the acquainting you, that assoone as I had brought Ventidius to his Appartment, I retir'd with Vdozia to hirs, where I told hir at large, how absolutely hir Servant had offer'd me the Crowne of Armenia, and how as absolutely I had declin'd it; Vdozia was infinitly more satisfy'd that I had refus'd it, than that I had the Power to weare it, and gave me such handsome retributions for the former, that I found there might be as great a Reward for haveing bin virtuous, as in being so; but knowing how much higher an influence an ador'd Mistris has over a Lover, than any other cofinement is capable of, I conjur'd hir, as I did Tye my selfe from doeing Artabazus any harme, that shee would Ventidius,  & give as good an accompt of hir Servant, as I would of hir Brother; Vdozia at first made some scruples to implore from Ventidius what he had obliquely deny'd me, since it would evince shee thought shee had a power over him, which shee very much doubted shee had not; but yet at last shee determin'd to doe Armenia a considerable service, or by hazarding so sensible a disgrace as a repulse would amount vnto, manifest shee apprehended nothing more than not obligeing hir Country, and nothing at all, when the safety of it, came in competition with any thing else: 'Twas therefore some three howres after, being inform'd Ventidius was gone to divert himselfe in the Palace Gardens, that Vdozia, arm'd with such generous and publique Thoughts, went thither to him, waited on by none but me, where after a short search, wee perceiv'd him lying upon some Grasse, shade'd with Lemmon, and Pomegrannet Trees, and truely he was so intent on what he was doeing, as we perceiv'd that was the viewing Vdozia's Picture, before he sawe hir, which assoone as he did, he rose up surpriz'd and told hir, I have bin Madam, compareing together the Charmes of my first and second Vanquisher, and finde the disproportion so transcendent, that I have noe way to excuse my first submission, but to remember I made it to a Conqueror, who though shee made not use of such vnresistable Armes as my second, yet shee did of hir Name. If (said Vdozia) I esteem'd it not a higher wrong to the generous Ventidius, to beleive so small a Beauty as Vdozia's could captivate him, than not to credit what he has so often repeated, I would not conjure him by some demonstration to evince a Truth, which he cannot be more concern'd to make me beleive, than I am to have pregnant cause to doe it. Ah Madam (said Ventius) I shall acknowledge your furnishing me with an occasion to manifest so high, & just a Truth, to be as transcendent an obligation, as 'tis an impossibility & Cruelty, if the way you propound unto that ende, be by Merit or Tyme; Neither can such injunctios be more a Torment to me, than an injury to your Beauty. I have already (said Vdozia) told you I am so much concearn'd in beleiveing what you endeavour to perswade me, that I shall not so long protract my owne satisfaction, as to prescribe any length of tyme to confirme it, not so flatter my selfe, & wrong the generous Ventidius, as to motion merit in that Sense he seemes to doe it; That which I have to propound is of a quality, which if he will graunt it, 'twill take up no more tyme than to say he does so. Oh Gods (reply'd the impatient Ventidius) the highest favour next to finding out so obligeing an expedient, is immediatly to name it. 'Tis (said Vdozia) to pardon Artabazus, and Armenia a fault which perhaps the necessity they were both reduc'd unto by Arsaces activenesse, and Crassus remissenesse, may in some degree extenuate; or if both those doe not, yet still in the Concession I shall finde the greater proofe of what I am not a litle concearn'd to be convinc'd of. Would to the Gods faire Princesse Ventidius reply'd their Faults were as great, as the Power shee has over me which commands me to excuse them, I should the sooner doe it, since thereby the greatnesse of the proofe of the Truth, would be the more proportionate to the Truth it selfe; Yes Madam, I doe absolutely forgett them, and though I know of how vast prejudice it may to me to disobey the Poeple of Rome, yet I know 'twill be of infinitely more, to disobey the faire Vdozia, for whome the reason that I should eternally obey hir, cannot transcend the inclination which I have perpetually to doe it. The generous Ventidius, ( I reply'd) shall not runn any hazard to obey Vdozia, and though I am much concearn'd in my King,  & my Country, yet I am much more in my Freind, so that I determine immediatly to make a journy to Artabazus, who if he gives you not a rise to oblige him, and such a one too, as my apologize sufficiently for your doeing so, you shall not hazard your destruction, to manifest your Civility. All (said ventidius) I will desire, since he is in the blessing of the faire Vdozia's concerne, is, that he will not by being an Enemy to Rome, provoke me to disobey hir Commands, or after such a provocation, by not doeing so, render my selfe vnworthy to have bin honor'd with them. But (he continu'd) is there no other way but by Artavasdes absence to settle Armenia? No (I reply'd) I beleive mine will accellerate this great worke better than any others. 'Twere to be too prolixe to tell you Vdozia's retributions and mine to Ventidius, with his Civilities on them: I will therefore only acquaint you, that being ready to take Horse, I recommended the care of Ventidius to Vdozia & enjoyn'd hir so to use hir Prisoner, that he might have noe desires of altering that Name; Ventidius answer'd me for hir, 'twas impossible shee should deny me that request, since 'twas so, that he should ever desire a more noble Title. Then (after having begg'd me to tell Artabazus from him, that for some powerfull considerations, he would desire no greater Pennance for his past fault, than to repeate it, which was, to continue a Neuter) I began my journy, which prou'd not very long, because above my expectation I found the King at Cammona, whither the necessity of his Affaires, by the Intelligence of Ventidius being on the Frontiers, drew him; All the Court admir'd at my coming to it, and Artabazus when he saw me come into the Pallace Garden (where he was then walking with some of his Councell) was asmuch surpriz'd one way, as after I had told him the occasion of my visit, he was the other. He made me a Thousand excuses for the necessity of his Cryme (for so he tearm'd what he had done with Altezeera) & with as many embraces, acknowledg'd my care, and my affection, when (as he said) he was so farre from meriting either, that he did the contrary. In a word, after I had told him on what tearmes he might have Ventidius his Freind, not only (with raptures of joy) he condiscended to them, but by a letter to him, acknowledg'd he had twice deriu'd both his safety, and his Crowne, from his generosity to Artabazus, and Freindship to Artavasdes. As soone as I had thus settl'd my businesse to my Kings likeing, aswell as Ventidius's, (for the latter could not more joyfully embrace the occasion of serving Vdozia, than the former did the Freindship of the Romans, against whome he was so ill provided, by the absence, and discontents of Phanasder, and as he said of Artavasdes too, that he was determin'd to have submitted to their Mercy, to avoyde doeing so to their Force) I tooke leave of the King, without leting him know how I had refus'd that Title, or imploring his Iustice against Crassolis, who I learnt was still conceal'd,  & which consequently I thought had bin a fruitlesse, and probably a prejudiciall request. Artabazus who found me possitively resolu'd to depart, seem'd to be asmuch greiu'd for my leaving him, as he had bin pleas'd at the cause, & the result of my visit, and to invite my continuance, he offer'd me large advantages, amongst many others, that of commanding during my life, the Armenian Militia; yet this, aswell as the rest, I entirely declin'd, for though I thought nothing could dispence me from a generall care of Armenia, & the King of it, yet I esteem'd my wrongs might not only excuse my not liveing at Court, but also my refusall of any Command which was not conduceing to my Revenge on Pacorus, who though he had by giveing me my Life, thereby confin'd me to act nothing particularly against his, yet by his having render'd it my Torment, I esteem'd my selfe thereby not concluded from ending it by his hands at the head of an Army; besides I resolu'd my selfe not a litle disenfranchis'd from that obligation, by restoreing him so many considerable Prisoners after the Battell on the bankes of Euphrates, and by the care I had of his Person before, and in it. 'Twas therefore that I implor'd the King to excuse my not accepting a Command, which though of infinite honor, yet was consider'd by me lesse out of that respect, than from an assurance I thereby receiv'd, that he thought I was not his Enemy, though he had given me the highest provocation to be so; which good opinion he had contracted of me, I could not better merrit, than by declining so advantagious an offer, to put my selfe in a farre meaner condition for his service, which I esteem'd my attending on Ventidius was, and would prove and for the doeing of which, I humbly begg'd his permission. Artabazus graunted me my request, because I would not graunt him his, & having againe convinc'd my beleife; that he would not be an Enemy to the Romans, by many pregnant reasons, & by othes, I tooke a finall leave, and with as great expedition in my returne to Sattala, as in my goeing from it; to safely arriu'd there, and found, (dureing my absence) that Vdozia had so well discover'd hir Servants merit, and perfections, that any intercession of mine for him, could not have bin more just, than 'twas vnnecessary. Ventidius seem'd almost as much satisfy'd with the successe of my journy, as with my returne, and findeing by the former he could not make a longer residence at Sattala, without as largely intrenching on his honor, as by his abandoning it, he should on his felicity, he declar'd the next morning he intended to force himselfe from his Ioyes, to returne to his Army. This resolve, and my former observation, made me esteeme it as fitt, as I did beleive it would not be difficult, to obtaine an assurance from Vdozia, that when Ventidius did Crowne himselfe with Lawrell, shee would with Myrtles, and make him a Conqueror in Love, after he had made himselfe one in Warre; To make hir confesse to me this was hir resolution, was farre more facile, than to make hir doe it to Ventidius; but at last the passionate conjurations of a meritorious Servant, vnited with those of a beloved Brother, were so prevalent, that they extorted a declaration, which shee could not deliver with more blushes, than he in whose favour 'twas made, receiv'd it with Extacies & Transports: I remember amongst many other expressions of the generous Ventidius's, this was one, I blesse the Gods (my faire Princesse) that they have made it my destiny to fight against a Nation which never yet was vaquisht, that the world may be convinc't, this high conquest was reseru'd for Vdozias Souldier, who can no more be deny'd victory, bearing that most glorious Title, than it can be, that that Title is so. These necessary productions of a transcendent joy, and Passion, were no sooner qualify'd, than I assur'd Ventidius I would waite on him in this Warre, to satisfy my Freindship, aswell as Revenge. This promise was receiued with new Raptures, and I found, how agreeable my Company was to him, since it could appeare as a great joy, in his being already possest with so high a one. Vdozia made no small scruples to deprive hir selfe at once of both hir concerns, but when I assur'd hir my presence might in noe vnconsiderable degree contribute to the preservation of Ventidius, whose too high Appetite to Glory, might cast him into resembling dangers, & that his conversation, & the diversion of Warre, might efface the reliques of a greife, whose entire extinction was not indifferent to hir, shee at last consented to my voyage, & perhaps my departure with Vertidius the next morning, did not a litle contribute to the free liberty of hir weepeings, for since in the very Teares themselves none could reade their cause, shee shedd hirs the more vnrestrain'dly; and hir Brother, & hir Lovers joynt departure made them as equally Asscribable to Affection, as Passion, though for my parte, I not only beleiv'd, but was satisfy'd with their relishing more of the last, than the first. But Ventidius now assur'd, his victory over the Parthians, would give him a more noble one in Vdozia (at least one that he valu'd so) flue to his Army, resolving to bring his owne, & that Empires Fate to a sudden Tryall. All a long the way as we went to Allexandretta, he entertain'd me with such passionate discourses of his Flame, that I must acknowledge, they sett my old wounds fresh a bleeding, and by his admirable expressions of a successefull Love, he not only made me resent more pregnantly my owne Misery in a contrary Fate, but inflam'd me with resolues, to act in this Warre such performances, as might force Altezeera to esteeme me worthy hir affection, though shee were vncapable to conferre it on me; or by a noble Death end my misfortunes, & desires together. The joy of the Roman Army at Ventidius comeing to it, appear'd as great as it could doe in a victory, and they were so satisfy'd with it, that though he had brought them nothing but his Person, he had bin as welcome, as bringing with it the assureance that he had ty'd Artabazus hands; at which all the Romans seem'd to be much satisfy'd, not that they wanted the vanity of beleiveing themselves soone able to have done it, but that they consider'd all things as misfortunes, which retarded their revengeing the Death, and appeaseing the Manes of so many of their Cittizens as fell with Crassus. Ventidius extreamly pleas'd to observe, his Army were in so obligeing a temper, began his Martch the next morning towards the River of Euphrates, where his Intelligencers assur'd him a vast Army of the Parthians lay, to justifie their Frontiers. The Roman Generall sent a Herauld to them to denounce the Warre, which he said the Romans were not wont to steale upon, but to make with their Enemies; That since he was determin'd to prosecute them to the end of the World, & that nothing could avoyde a Battell, 'twould be more generous, if they would exempt him from a tedious Martch, by divideing the length of it betweene them. This denunciation, & desire being sent, found a generous returne from Labienus, who commanded the Parthian Army, and who advanc'd Fower dayes Martch into Syria, to decline all disadvantages over the Romans, since (as he said) the Parthians needed noe greater, than they had in their Courages; which because so pregnant an Argument as the losse of Crassus and 40000 of his Countrymen could not convince them of, he was comeing purposely to manifest, by a fresh demonstration, which he was confident would be so signall a one, that though none of them should live to acknowledge it, yet their Deaths should doe it for them. Ventidius excus'd this high reply, by the Parthians puting themselves in a condition which he was more than perswaded would soone affoard him a certainty of revengeing it. The two Generalls having agree'd upon a sett Day to decide the Quarrell, by one of the Parthian Trumpets which past betweene both Armyes for the makeing of this bloody bargaine, I diligently enquir'd after my deare Artabbanes, who I concluded was not in the Parthian Army, because another Commanded it; but this Trumpeter, either thorough obedience, or ignorance, continu'd me in Mine; but the joy that I should not fight against my generous Freind, could hardly transcend my greife when I knew I should have the like Fate against Pacorus, yet I hoped this Battell would facilitate my desires against another opportunity. At last the fatall day came, and 'twas then I perceiv'd in Ventidius so many Martiall Charmes, aswell in his knowledge, as in his Lookes, that had Vdozia but then seene him, shee must have vnavoydably compos'd a parte of his that dayes victory. The Generall of the Romans would have in this Battell resin'd that title to me, but I appear'd as much offended at the offer, as he was generous in it, and 'twas then he protested, he deplor'd his not being a Monarch, since thereby he had bin acomptable to none but to the Gods, and Reason, for his Actions, and consequently would have forc't me to have taken that dayes Comand. I will not tell you (continu'd Artavasdes) my returne to this flattery. 'Tis enough you know I did decline it, but yet I could not, the Command of the Italian Cavalrie, which was compos'd of the Youth & Gallantry of Rome, and by which Charge I found Ventidius gave me meanes, as ample as my desires, to purchase Glory. He himselfe tooke his place at the head of the Legionary Souldiers, & the signalls were no sooner given, than the Armyes began the Battell, with such fury, that had I not knowne they were both copos'd of the Warlikest Nations in the World, I could then no longer have bin in that ignornce; I will not amuze my selfe to give you the retaile retail of this famous Day, 'tis enough you know Ventidius did like Ventidius, & consequently peirc'd & broake whatever oppos'd him; & though he fonnd a vertuous resistance, yet it was so farre from hindring his victory, that it did but sett it off the Better. The Parthian Cavalrie are generally the best that are, & their Numbers much exceeding ours, wee found we needed the Legioaries helpe, which as soone as Ventius had, he advanc't a precipitate pace to affoar'd it us. I include my selfe in the Number of those that wanted it, though the Gods had given the Right-wing which I comanded, as entire a victory, as Septimus a defeate, who commanded the left; So that the Generall of the Parthian Horse, and I, observing our mutuall successes, rally'd our Troopes together with what expedition we could, but that Nation being more active of their Feete, whe they cannot use their hands, than the Romans, & the executio remaining more bloody on our side than theirs, their Comander had sooner brought his Souldiers vnder their Colours, & in greater Numbers than I could possibly vnder mine, yet Ventidius's arrivall so well redrest that misfortune, as I found it None; our new dispute seem'd a second Battell, & Ventidius found he must obtaine two victoryes, to winne one. I cannot with Truth, decline telling you, That observing the Generall of the Parthian Horse, who was much more remarkable for his Courage, than his Armes, which yet were in the beginning all cover'd with Rubies, though now with a Nobler but resembling colour, I ridd up to him, and having singl'd him out, I indeavour'd to take a revenge of those many deaths he had given divers which seru'd vnder me; but those which were spectators of our Combate, fear'd,  & beleiv'd I would increase his victories, rather than punish them; I must confesse, his first stroakes were so vnintermissive and briske, that I might have made that my owne opinion too, & perhaps the rage of it's being Mine, did not a litle contribute to the giveing of those wounds, which soone made the beholders to alter it, but in bestowing on him some which were very dangerous, I receiu'd many which were so, but mine were so much more obligeing, or my constitution so much stronger than his, that vniteing all his forces to give me one blowe (which might revenge my having so much dimminisht them) as his Sword was in the Ayre to act it, his Spirits abandon'd him, his Armes fell softly to his Side, and then he himselfe fell off his Horse on the ground; some Romans according to their barbarous custome, rann to cutt off this valiant Parthians Head, to present it to their Generall, but perceiving their intent, I lighted hastily to prevent it; but I found my selfe so weaken'd by the losse of Blood, that I no sooner toucht the ground with my Feete, than I did the like with all my Body, yet as the Gods would have it, remembring the cause why I had abandon'd my Horse, I crept where the generous Parthian lay, where not being able to defend him by my commands, I did it with my Sword, and receiv'd some wounds to preserve him, who had given me so many; but my assistance had bin fruitlesse to him, if Ventidius had not then come to mine, of whome I had only strength enough to begg, as he lov'd Vdozia, or Atravasdes that he would preserve my valiant Enemy; which words I had no sooner vtter'd, than I fell off my Knees by him, and almost in as vnpromiseing a condition as he was in. Ventidius one of the most geneous Freinds thought he could not better merit that Title, than by having asmuch care of my desires, as of me; this made him at the same instant in which he sent for the Chyrurgions, to beate off those Souldiers who endeavour'd by the the Death of the Parthian to revenge, my supposed one,  & many of their companions reall Deaths, which he had that Day acted; Ventidius found so much difficulty to effect this, that as he afterwards confell, had not my pressing conjurations inviolably engag'd him to it, he had given his Souldiers a liberty, which the Parthian usage to Crassus, made it almost as high an injustice to deny them, as did the sad condition this had reduc'd me to; but at length having made himselfe to be obey'd, he caus'd (& helpt) me to be carry'd to my Tent, and sett up another neere mine, to which he made my Enemy be brought; but he was so sensible of my danger, that he was no longer so of his Glory, and successe; for commanding the Tribunes to prosecute the Victory, & bring him an accompt, at what rate they had bought it, & how deere the Parthians had lost it, to my Tent, he immediatly return'd thither againe, where he found me so much restor'd, as that I had strength enough to congratulate his glorious successe, which was so much the more so, by his having cheifly, & almost solely purchast it, & to aske him afterwards what was become of my valiant Enemy, whose usage I implor'd from him once againe might be as resembling to mine, as his danger was. Ventidius gave me that accompt of him which I have given you, which made me send one of my Domesticks to enquire after a Life, I was asmuch concern'd to preserve, as I had so lately bin to destroy; my Messenger brought me word that as yet he was not recover'd from his fainting, but that the Chirurgions by some certaine Symptomes found he would not long continue in it. I was as gladd at the last parte of this information, as troubl'd at the first,  & observing that Ventidius only call'd him the Parthian Prisoner, I askt him whether he had not yet learn't his Name and Quality. I have not (Ventidius reply'd) discover'd either, but I am confident all the Rules of Phisiognomy are false, if his quality be not answerable to the richnesse of his Armes; for the Chirurgions to stopp his bleeding, having taken off his Helmett, I perceiv'd in spight of his Palenesse, a Meene & Features, which could not but be charmeing in a perfect health, since they were almost so, in the condition he was then in. This Caracter (continu'd Artavasdes) would have made me suspect it was Artabbanes, but that my successe secur'd me from that feare; And as I was begging Ventidius to enquire scrutinously who the Parthian was, Septimus came in, and assur'd his Generall, that by the least partiall computation on both sides, the Romans had lost 2000 and their Enemyes 27000. Ventidius finding me in so promiseing a condition, suspended a while the dutyes of a Freind, to act those of a Generall, but he had no sooner hastily dispatcht his Spyes to learne the Countenance and intentions of the Enemy, & settl'd his Guards, than he return'd to me againe, & gave me no small hopes but those he had employ'd would next morning satisfy my curiosity, & learne who the Prisoner was; with this flattering expectation we enentertain'd one another 'till the hower prescrib'd me for sleepe, which I could not doe, 'till I had first sent to enquire how the Parthian did, and learnt that he was restor'd to Life, though not to his Sences. The next morning the Sunn was hardly risen, when Ventidius came hastily into my Tent, and having sent out all those in it, he told me with a Face cover'd with joy. At length Artavasdes, at length the Gods have manifested themselves to be so, by having given you wherewithall to revenge your wrongs, and put Altezeera in a posture to repaire those shee has so vnjustly loden you with; Yes Artavasdes, that Prisoner which yesterday was made one by your Courage, is Pacorus, who vnderstanding of my intention to decide our Quarrell by a picht Battell, came in post from Selutia and from Altezeera to the Parthian Army, which also he was the more invited to, by its being commanded by Labienus (his Favourite). This is confirm'd by three severall Spyes, who all assure me that the Gentleman with the Armes cover'd with Rubies, is Pacorus, whose losse the Parthians asmuch lament, as that of the Battell, and of their Generall, of whome as yet they can learne no Newes; you will have also (continu'd Ventidius) the felicity of seeing your Revenge acted, without being the Iudge, or Guilty of it; For one of my Instructions from the Triumvirat and Senate, is, neither to give, nor receive Quarter, so that in my necessary obedience you may derive a satisfaction, which perhaps your owne nice Gallantry would scruple to conferre on you. Iudge generous Freinds (said Artavasdes) Iudge if my astonishment wre great at so strange and vnexpected an adventure, in which I had no small debate, whether it were an accident fitter for my joy, or Greife; but after a short reflection & dispute on it, I reply'd; Ah Ventidius, Pacorus must not die, my Honor aswell as Reason will oppose it, for to let a Prisoner be executed by the Sword of Iustice, which avoyded it by that of Warre, cannot more intrench upon both our Reputations, than it must on my Felicity; For though Pacorus Death will free me from an injoying Ryvall, yet alas, the way in which 'tis done, will raise me as great an obstructio as it remoues; for with what confidence, & hopes, can I present my selfe to Altezeera, having bin in effect the Murtherer of hir Husband? by so horrid a Cryme, if shee has any aversion for me, it will be as abundantly as justly increast, or if hereafter shee should discover my Innocency (which is too bright to be eternally clouded) I should herby render hir vncapable to reward it. No generous Ventidius, the Gods have too palpably taken the Protection of Pacorus, to make me become his distroyer, and they never yet permitted Sinne to be the way to felicity; besides I owe him a Life, which, if I now repay, I shall ease my selfe of a burthen, that next to Altezeeras's Inconstancy, does most loade me; neither is it impossible, but so high a demonstration as this is of my concearne in hir satisfaction, may create in hir a proportionate one for mine, and induce hir to confesse, what shee has done was hir fault or at least hir misfortune, which acknowledgement of hir offence, I shall esteeme the highest blessing next to hir repaireing it; Neither shall I ever hope hir pardon for having made Pacorus a Prisoner, but by seting him at liberty; and those wounds I have given him, cannot more nobly be excus'd, nor by so pregnant an evincement that I was ignorant to whome I gave them, as that of restoreing him his Liberty, when I knew it. I shall therefore (generous Ventidius) conjure you, by all those motives which you esteeme most prevalent, permit me to dispose of Pacorus before his Quality be known to your Army, least so great a Guift afterwards might prove a proportionat prejudice to the Giver. That this Prisoner (said Ventidius) is Pacorus, is not more certaine, than that before now all the Army know it, for my Spyes never being employ'd but about publque concernes, I never us'd to receive their Intelligences but before such of the Army, with whome I use to advise how to improve, and act upon them, so that this being given me as the custome is, and being a thing of so great encouragement to the Souldiers, & honor, and advantage to you that tooke him, I was so farre from endeavouring to suppresse it, that I contrybuted on both those scoares to the diuvlgeing it; Neither can I thinke but therein I have abundatly seru'd you, which I beleive wilbe your opinion too, if you act not asmuch against your selfe, as the Gods doe for you; for I know you are too-much a Freind to virtue, and too knowing in Altezeera's, either to desire, or expect, a reward of your Passion, and services, in the condition shee now is in; so that there being but two obstacles to the attaineing of your felicity, that of hir reall marriage, & that of your immaginary guilt, the greatest of them by Pacorus Death wilbe remou'd, and who knowes whether therein both of them will not be so, for perhaps the danger Armenia was in, did invite hir to hir Crime, and it may be the more to suppresse Pacorus jealousies (who could not but learne hir pre- ingagement to you) shee broake with you on your pretended, and vnmention'd fault, the better to palliate hir owne; neither is it vnlikely, but that Pacorus by some Artes of his, has settl'd this misvnderstanding betwixt you, and after his being possest of Altezeera, lest shee should learne it privatly by some other way, and so as a reparation recall you to hir, has himselfe disclos'd it, thereby to hinder hir from such a proceeding; besides should Altezeera come to learne your Innocency, 'twilbe so farre from being an advantage to you, that it 'twilbe a torment to hir, and consequently to you; and Pacorus according to the course of Nature, being as probable to live, as either Altezeera or you, all you can derive from the manifestation of your Integrity, is only to let hir know, but not render hir capable to acknowledge, or reward it; whereas if Pacorus be sent into another World, at the same instant your innocency is cleer'd, it will vndoubtedly be recompenc'd: These reasons (continu'd Ventidius) canot more evidently manifest that Pacorus Death is necessary to your Felicity, than I will, that it cannot be so much as suspected to be your action, or by your consent, for his being a Prisoner cannot be more gnerally knowne, than that my Commission commands me to take none, or if any be taken to execute them; so that that which is a generall order, no body, nor Altezeera hirselfe, can cosider as a particular act for your satisfaction, or Interest; what you have already done for Pacorus, evinces also that Truth, since when you had the the power to kill him, you not only declin'd doeing so, when too he had sufficiently invited you to it, by leaveing you only strength enough to performe it, but also employ'd that litle remnant of life you had left, to preserve his, which had reduc't you to that extreamity;  & (said Ventidius) you must give me leave somewhat to mention my owne safety in this particular, which will runn an infinite hazard, by not only infringeing my Comission, but by letting goe so considerable a Prisoner. Would to the Gods (I reply'd) I could as easily answer all your objections, as the last, since then I could promise my selfe a concession of my request, asmuch from your Reason, as Freindship; for whatsoever is the cause of Altezeera's change, I am confident Pacorus being thus remov'd, will not leave hir a latitude to repaire it; but on the contrary, 'twill make me for ever vncapable of appearing what I am; though you alleage that my having once preseru'd Pacorus will evidence I am cleere of his Death, yet I am satisfy'd it will prove the cotrary, for, to save him when I knew not who he was,  & to permit his death when I knew him to be Pacorus, will justly showe shee was oblig'd by my ignorance, & wrong'd by my knowledge; & indeede will render me as guilty to hir, as to my selfe, for knowing the perfect Freindship Ventidius blesses me with all, shee cannot doubt if I had embrac'd Pacorus perservatio with earnestnesse but my successe would have bin proportionat to my desire; besides, should shee never know I was consenting to his Death, 'twere enough perpetually to banish me from hir, that I did. Ventidius was aboute to answer me, when Septimus, and a great many Officers came in to my Tent to visit me, and to give him an advice of such importance, as necessitated him a while to leave me alone, which I no sooner was, than I began to dispute with my selfe on my admirable, and strange Fate, & to elect some course upon so emergent an occasion; at length the Gods made me pitch upon one, which at Ventidius's returne I resolv'd to communicate to him, in the expectance whereof, I sent for one of my Phisitians and Chirurgions, who waited on Pacorus, to learne how he did; they told me, that as yet he had not recover'd his sences perfectly, nor spoake, but they durst vndertake his cure if I were concern'd in it; Yes (I reply'd) I am so, infinitly, & enjoyne you as you value me, to have a care of him, and that you will not only keepe from his knowledge that 'twas I which he fought against, but my being in the Roman Army, both which you may imagine are of no small importance to me, since I commend them to you asmuch as his cure, or my owne. This they not only promis'd, but vndertooke to performe, which they might the more easily, because he was only waited on by my Servants. An hower after, Ventidius return'd to my Tent, where he told me, the occasio which drew him from it was, an advertisement brought him that Labienus, who was left for dead amongst many Thousands that were so, was by the care of one of his Servants, the foregoing Night brought to a Country-House not farre off, where beyond all expectation they found him give some symptomes of Life, which the diligent Servant to improve, went to a Village not farre off to fetch a Chirurgion; to send advice to the Parthian Army of this rare accident; and to let them know how dangerous a place their Generall was in, that they might suddenly remove him from it; one of my Spyes by good fortune was then in this Village, and so industriously play'd his part, that he got perfect information of this. Truth, which then he came to discover to me, and which occasion'd me to send a party of Horse to seize upon Labienus and bring him hither; they are just now return'd, but without him, for an hower before, 2000 Parthian Horse had carry'd him away in a Litter. Ventidius having made me this litle Relation, began a fresh to assault me about Pacorus, but when he found my resolution if not my reason, was vnconquerable, he told me, since I was so absolutly fixt upon my prejudice, he would affoard me his assistance in it, were it only to convince me he would not deny it me in any thing, and that what he had mention'd concerning his owne danger, was purely to invite me upon his score to yeeld to what was to prevent myne, since I declin'd it upon my owne; That therefore he was determin'd to send an expresse to Rome, to let the Senate know his victory, and the taking of Pacorus, whose liberty he would represent (as his owne opinion) would sooner settle the easterne World, than his Death, since his being of a generous disposition, an obligation that was so, would invite him to be a Freind to Rome; which would be a more virtuous Conquest over the Parthians, than they had over Crassus; whereas his Death by rendring the Parthians desperate, will render the Warre so too, which otherwise might be concluded without hazard, & with Glory. I will (continu'd Ventidius) so fill my Letters, not only to the Triumvirate, and Senate, with inducements to Mercy, but also all those I shall send to my particular Freinds, that I hope they will produce what you desire, at least if they doe not, I will be advertic'd of it by a Post, who shall arrive before my Expresse, that if Pacorus Death be commanded, before I receive that order, I will by letting him escape, render it impossible to be executed: this course (said Ventidius) I elect, because perhaps I may have no cause to breake my instructions, & if I have, the doeing it may prove a greater obligation to Artavasdes; besides, Pacorus's wounds cannot possibly be cur'd before an Expresse doe goe, and returne from Rome, neither will it be amisse we learne what Countenance Altezeera puts upon the Newes of his death, or imprisonment. This generous assurance made me embrace the maker of it, & then I told him, since his departure, I had given strict order Pacorus should be kept in a perfect ignorance, either of my having bin his Enemy, or of my being in the Roman Army, which I had done in expectation that some advantagious expedient might be found out for me, if he gave the Parthian his Liberty, who I intended to visit in excellent disguise, thorough which if Pacorus did not discover me, I might be satisfy'd Altezeera could not; and having, made him know 'twas from me he deriu'd his liberty and life, I would returne into Parthia with him, where I made no doubt to learne the Cause of my disgrace. But (said Ventidius) suppose Pacorus should know you, and yet not seeme to doe it, 'till he came where he has a power to ruine you; and what good too, can it doe you to learne the cause of your disgrace, when it lyes not in the Princesses power to redresse it? If Pacorus discovers me (said I) which I will almost render an impossibility, I cannot yet suspect, but what I doe for him, will confine him from doeing any thing against me; and to learne the cause of my disgrace will at least silence the Torment of my suspension,  & restore me to Altezeera's good opinion, which by hir marriage, is the highest felicity I can now aspire unto; besides, who knowes what accidents may happen, which my being upon the place may improve; and I must tell you, I begin to flatter my selfe with a beleife that the Gods are weary of persecuting me, since by this new accident they give me some Signes of it. I will (continu'd Artavasdes) passe over the particulars of our discourses to tell you the results, which were, That Ventidius yeelded up his reasons to my desires, and assur'd me if he had no answer from Rome by the tyme Pacorus was able to make use of his liberty, he should not withstanding be restor'd to it. Ventidius immediatly after withdrew himselfe to make his dispatch to the Senate, & to let Vdozia know of that successe, which he deplor'd, since thereby I was disabl'd from giving hir an accompt of it. Whilst wee were in expectation of Pacorus's and my Recovery, the Roman Army campt upon the same place in which it had bin so victorious, for I could not perswade Ventidius to prosecute his victory by any hazard of my Life, which he thought would runn no small one, by my removing with the Army, or by my being left in any of those small Townes which were adjacent to it, so that I did more oblige the Parthians by having fought against them, than the contrary in having done it. And though Ventidius sate still so long, yet he made his Army beleive it proceeded from the impossibility of doing otherwise, 'till the great Number of the wounded were cur'd, which if left behinde, that Guard that vnavoydably must be so too, for their security, would endanger the martching Army. Yet during my cure, the Romans made a sharpe Warre on the Parthians by frequent and successefull incursions; & I, constantly sent to visit Pacorus, but vnder the name of Pharasmanes, which was that I intended to assume in my disguise; but at length being perfectly recover'd, the better to act my part, by the same Messenger which return'd with Vdozia's answere to Vetidius (which was as obligeing as he could desire or perhaps expect) I gave out, I had advertisements of some stirres in Armenia, which Ventidius perswaded the Romans, my presence only would suppresse; so that taking a publique and formall leave, I made all the Campe beleive I was gone; But the same Night I return'd privatly againe, sending all my Equipage to Vdozia, and reserveing only Philanax with that Phisitian, and Chirurgion, which attended Pacorus. And to shew you my Disguise was really what the name importes, I have but to acquaint you, that though Ventidius expected me at a sett hower, and knew I would weare one, yet we not only saluted one another, but I told him I was sent from Artavasdes to begg his pardon for not being able to waite on him 'till next morning, without discovering of me which he did not, 'till I told him who I was, and which indeed was not strange, for my Haire that naturally is of a darke browne, I had collour'd of a bright flaxen, and by a certaine Composition strangly alter'd the collour of my Skinn,  & to perfect all, by the helpe of a certaine Gold Wyer fasten'd & conceal'd in my Mouth, I had disguis'd my voyce asmuch as my Face; In a word, I had not knowne my selfe, if it had not bin for some internall Greifes, which nothing had the power either to disguise or mittigate, & which but too well forc'd me to remember, that I was still the vnfortunate Artavasdes. Ventidius was extreamly satisfy'd with my having so deluded him, which he fancy'd an impossibility, 'till by experiment he found his error. The next morning therefore I went to visit Pacorus, and to give him the consolation, his condition, and the duty of a Gentleman required; I found him well advanc't on his recovery, but I found him perfect in all those Charmes of conversation, which 'till then I never knew he so aboundantly possest. I will not scruple my generous Freinds (continu'd Artavasdes) to tell you, I was not a litle troubl'd at it, and truly by my constant frequenting him I began to despaire of my condition, by having cause to beleive 'twas Altezeeras Iudgement only which had made me vnfortunate. To abbreviate my Story, I will let you know that at last Pacorus was so well recover'd, as my Phisitian told me, within Three dayes he might without danger make use of his Horse; two of which were scarcely expir'd, when Ventidius Messenger from Rome came privatly into the Campe, and assur'd him his Expresse from the Senate would be with him within eight and forty howres; that what had bin propounded by him to the Senate, had bin largely debated in it, and had bin carry'd according to his desires, had not Marke Anthony oppos'd it, who suspected Pacorus liberty would settle Asia in a perfect Peace, and consequently take away the occasion of his goeing into the East with an Army, which he coveted, only to palliate that Passion he had for Cleopatra the Queene of Ægipt, and which he durst not publiquely manifest, lest it might create any differences betwixt him and Octavius Caesar, whose Sister the Princesse Octavia he had marry'd, and who in all Mens Eyes (but Anthony's) transcended hir asmuch in Beauty, as in Vertue; That therefore he had so manag'd the businesse in the Senate, that they had sent a possitive Order immediatly to put Pacorus to Death. Ventidius was not dishearten'd at this adverticement, and to hinder me from being so, he imediatly (but by wayes too- prolixe for a repetition) put things in such a certaine posture, that I knew there would be no difficulty that Night to steale away with my Freind, and my Ryvall; 'till when, I spent the tyme in takeing leave of my deare Ventidius; but as soone as the hower came, I went to Pacorus, and having brought him into one of the most obscure corners of of the Tent, I told him, I beleive Sir you have already learnt, that he by whose good Fortune you were made a Prisoner, hazarded asmuch himselfe for you, as he did against you, and thereby you were preserv'd from loseing your Life as absolutely, as you have your Liberty. This Gentleman who was so much your Enemy, and your Freind, is in the latter Quality so much Mine, that though he is call'd Pharasmenes aswell as I, yet there is as high an equality between our Mindes, as betweene our Names; in his successe against you, he receiv'd some such wounds, that though they were not as dangerous as yours, yet they were in such vnfortunate and inconvenient places, that he has not bin able to pay you those visits, which he knowes is due to your vertue, asmuch as to your quality; 'twas therefore that I being sooner recover'd of Mine, he enjoyn'd me to supply his place; but Sir that you may see his concerne in you extends further than the formall partes of humanity, he has now sent me to you, not only to let you know there is an expresse order come from Rome to put you to Death, but also to attempt all immaginable meanes I can, to prevent it. At this vnexpected Advertisement Pacorus appear'd in some disorder, and truely I should have wonder'd more at the contrary, than I did at it, having by Altezeera a farre deerer blessing to lose than Life. I gave him a little tyme to reflect upon his condition, which the more he did, the more desperate it did appeare; Crassus barbarous Death, and the Romans as barbarous usage to all Princes who they esteem'd, or at least tearm'd so, made him 'tell me. Your generous Freind I beleive (Pharasmenos) by his desires, has already asmuch oblig'd me as he will have the power, for I know too-well the condition of the Romans, to be ignorant of my owne; I shall not yet but acknowledge my selfe extreamly his Debtor,  & asmuch as if what he desir'd were acted; I beseech you therefore, tell him from me, that having noe other way to pay what I owe him, I will doe it in cotributing to his glory, by the resolutio of my sufferings, which perhaps I shall in some degree performe, if I endure my Death with asmuch resolution, as I oppos'd it. This generous reply gave me new invitations to serve him, and confin'd me a fresh to act against the dictates of my love, to follow those of my Honor, which forc'd me to embrace Pacorus, & to assure him, before next morning I would participate in his intended punishment, or free him from it. To be breife, I perform'd the latter, and by learning the Word from Ventidius, I brought him safe out of the Campe, where I told him, That having by that action lost my Fortune with the Romans, I must depend for it on him, which if he approu'd, I would waite on him, into Parthia. The Generous Pacorus embrac't me a Thousand tymes for this assurance, and gave me as many thankes for it, as for his Life and Liberty. We found some good and swift Horses in a little Grove which by my orders were brought thither by Philanax, who I then sent to Vdozia, he being as perfectly knowne to Altezeera, as the contrary to hir husband. I neede not tell you the Allarme Pacorus escape gave unto the Roman Campe, how seemingly diligent Ventidius was to recover him, what formall Letters he sent to the Senate to excuse himselfe for a misfortune, which was so much the more extenuated as to him, because Pacorus was escap't befor he had receiu'd their Commands for his execution, nor the vast promises he made of taking him againe, or Parthia in his steed, 'tis enough you know, that what he said was receiv'd as he desir'd, for Anthony was satisfy'd, Pacorus was at lest deliver'd in such a way, as would assertaine a Warre asmuch as his Death. Whilst these things were thus transacting amongst the Romans, the Parthian and I came safe to Seleutia, where the Court then resided; Pacorus (who perfectly knew the Palace) ledd me to the Princesse Appartment, where wee found with hir (for then Parthenissa, Lindadory, & Zephalinda were in the Ile of Eden) Arsaces, and Phraates all in Mourning, but alas Altezeera haveing much more in hir Lookes, than Cloathes. I cannot if I would tell you the raptures & transports at so vnexpected a returne from Death, or Captivity, (for they knew not which had bin Pacorus's Fate) but after the first celebrations of this joy, he ledd me by the hand to Arsaces & Altezeera, and told them 'twas to me they ow'd his Life and safety, and then acquainted them with all, with which I have you. Arsaces made me so many Complements, and thankes, that in them I read his concerne for his Sonne; but alas Altezeera did the like too, & wounded me a Thousand tymes more with hir Gratitude, than shee could have done with a contrary usage, manifesting by the esteeme shee plac't upon the performance, how much a higher one shee had for him, for whome 'twas perform'd. I must confesse, I was so confounded at it, though I had arm'd my selfe against by having prepar'd my selfe for it, that had not the Company bin more intent on their joy, than me, they had discover'd me in spight of my disguise. To passe over what would but trouble you to heare, and me much more to remember, or relate, I will tell you after a magnificent Supper, where the King and Princes constrain'd me to sitt with them, (giveing therein that honor to my services, which they thought was not due to me) The Princesse Altezeera leaving Pacorus, tooke me asiide to reitterate hir Civilities for his deliverance. Great Gods! you only know, with how much difficulty 'twas I abstain'd from teling hir, that hir leaving Pacorus to come unto Artavasdes, which shee did in that way of Gratitude, shee should have done in another, and that shee had reason to be gratefull for Pacorus deliverance, if shee knew from whome shee deriu'd it; but I had then enough fortitude to suppresse those riseings, and to tell hir, that had I but known so, transcendent a reward as the satisfaction of so faire a Princesse had attended that performance, I had acted it as much out of the dictates of Interest, as out of those of Honor, or Freindship. Wee entertain'd one another a while with discourses of this quallity, but the tyme was not long, for the impatient Pacorus came to ravish hir from me, and to place himselfe in those Extasies & Raptures, which the cruell Gods had eternally deny'd, the as constant, as vnfortunate Artavasdes. This separation was so operative, that had not the Prince Phraates, & the cheifest of the Court Come to conduct me to my Appartment, I had continu'd as fixt to the place I was in, as to my infelicity; but their Civilities drewe me out of my thoughts, which I suspended 'till they had left me in my Apartment, whither they accompany'd me against all my resistance. As soone as I was a Bedd, the remembrance of Altezeeras gratitude for having continu'd the impossibility of Artavasdes being made happy, came fresh into my Thoughts, and made me vtter things as disjointed as my hopes; but when I came to reflect, that in that same instant I was deploreing Altezeera's cruelty to me, shee was in my Ryvalls Armes, and affording him those joyes, which to be depriv'd of, could not be so great Misery, as to possesse, was a felicity, what did not my rage, & resentments make me speake? Ah (said I Artavasdes) was it not sufficient that the Gods, and Altezeera contributed to thy torments, but that thou must doe it thy selfe, by bringing Pacorus ont only to the embraces of thy Princesse, but thy selfe also to be the Spectator of them? Never more, Artavasdes never more complaine of the Gods, they had given thy Ryvall into thy hands, and when they began to declare themselves thy Freinds, thou dids't declare thy selfe thine Enemy, & by that performance, hast not only divested thy selfe eternally of hope, but also of the ease of complaining against all but thy selfe, without becomeing as vnjust to them, as thou hast bin to thy Love; whilst my thoughts inclin'd me on this side, they suggested to me many such reasonings; but after a short Calme, they began to incline me to consider Altezeera, arm'd with all those attractive Charmes, and Graces, which formerly had conquer'd me, and which by their yet retaining me in Captivity, too sufficiently prov'd their being infinite, and confyn'd me to beleive all my sufferings for hir, were too much my Duty, to be my trouble. No no Artavasdes (said I in those dicrats) thou hast still the same Quarrell to the Gods; for, by the way in which they gave thee thine Enemy, thou could'st not restore thy hopes, but by becoming vnworthy of them; and those same Gods which afforded thee the power of Revenge, made the acting it a greater Sinne, than it could be a satisfaction, & gave thee Honor, & Vertue enough to suspend all the inspirations of resentment; doe not then destroy the merit of thy performance, by repineing against it, 'tis more noble to merit Altezeera without possessing hir, than to possesse hir, without meriting hir; neither can what thou hast done, but one day contribute to the discloseing of thine Innocence, and that which discovers, must invite hir to reward it; waite then (Artavasdes) the manifestation of what the Gods (without declareing themselves none) cannot long conceale, and finde thy satisfaction in thy very Torment, by being pleas'd that Altezeera is so, though in Pacorus's Armes, & by calculateing thy owne joyes, by the seeing of his, if ever the Gods remove the obstruction of hir Marriage, and thy pretended Guilt. It was above a thousand times that I built and destroy'd such resolutions, sometimes determining to discover my selfe, and know my fault, or make hir acknowledge hirs; & then againe declineing that resolution; for I knew too- well Altezeera's scrupulous vertue, to have any hopes of liveing neere hir afterwards, though I should prove my selfe Innocent; & so the apprehension of being banisht from what I lov'd to see, made me rather elect to be thought criminall, & enjoy that felicity, than to appeare otherwise, and be derpiv'd of it. I had longer entertain'd my selfe in these disputes had not the Sunn's appearing, & afterwards some of the Princes Officers, put a period to them; The first of them which came into my Chamber gave me advice, that Pacorus had settl'd a large Pension on me, and form'd me an Equipage which I found proportionate to my reall Quality; but alas the next that visited me, were sent fro the Prince, & Altezeera, to know how I had past the Night? oh Gods! what difficulty had I to abstaine from sending them word, that their having past it so well, had made me almost passe it as ill; But though this strange Message sett all my wounds fresh a bleeding, yet I had so much discretion left, as only to answere it with a Complement as civill, as theirs was seemingly so; Assoone as I was drest I went into the Palace Gardens, which were so admirably oblig'd both by Arte, & Nature, that they would have vnavoydably prov'd a diversion, to a lesse inveterate Melancholly than Mine; I had not bin above two howres there, when I might perceive Pacorus, and Altezeera at the end of the walke I was in, comeing towards me, at which sight I could not abstaine from whispering to my selfe; Can you then Altezeera after having past a whole Night in Pacorus embraces, present your selfe without confusion before him; to whom you had first promis'd that blessinge; and canst thou (Artavasdes) after being convinc't that shee has done so, out-live that misfortune? or if thou dost, not doe it, to be reveng'd upon the Ravisher of thy Right, & joyes. I could no longer continue any reflections of this quality, because I went to meet them, where Altezeera by many reitterated expressions for Pacorus's delivery, but too-too palpably let me know how deare it was unto hir: Neither was it only at this time that shee did so, but so constantly upon all occasions that it gave me noe small Allarme shee had discover'd me, for I fear'd shee could not so incessantly persecute me out of gratitude, but hate. But (continu'd Artavasdes) if I should acquaint you in particular with all things that happen'd whilst I resided in Parthia, I should take up almost as much time as did my residence there; I will therefore only acquaint you, with those things which are most essentiall, and in pursuance thereof let yon knowe, That one Euening when all the Court were walkeing in the Palace Gardens, I had the Honor to lead the Princesse Altezeera, and being vndesign'dly gotten into a retir'd walke, shee earnestly conjur'd me to let hir know the Story of my Life, since (as shee said) 'twas from, it shee deriu'd that which made hirs, hir satisfaction. Would to the Gods faire Princesse (I was upon the point of saying) that my Life had not lasted a moment longer, than when upon it's owne score, it had created the felicity of yours; But knowing such a reply would have prov'd destructive to that resolution I had assum'd, of expecting in disguise, and with patience, what the Gods had determin'd of me, I gave hir an accompt of my Life, such as my Inuention then sugested, 'till my arrivall in Syria with Ventidius; but Madam (I continu'd) I cannot now obey you without something violating a Freinds injunctions, yet if you command me to proceede, you shall finde, I esteeme nothing more highly, and justly, than the honor of obeying you. Truly (said Altezeera) you have told me so many admirable things in your Life, and I have bin so infinity oblig'd unto it, that I should desire the continuatio of your Story, did I not apprehende your graunting my curiosity, might prove almost as great a trouble to you, as a satisfaction to me. Madam (I reply'd) to convince you, I cannot but please my selfe, while I doe the Princesse Altezeera; I will acquaint hir with the residue of my Story, and the rather, (not only as 'tis hir Comande) but as shee has some concernes in it. his Narration, when Callimmachus Servants interrupted him, by bringing in their Supper, which both he, and Artabbanes would have dispenc't with, for what it hinder'd them of; but the sooner to repaire that misfortune, they tooke a litle refreshment, and then Artavasdes having minded them he addrest his discourse to the Princesse Altezeera, continu'd it in these words. PARTHENISSA. THE SECOND PARTE THE FOVRTH BOOKE. in Asia)  & me, be very great, yet I can truely say, that betweene him, and Artavasdes, is equall to it; and perhaps I should speake noe vntruth, if I assur'd you, that, betweene Artavasdes & me, is not inferior unto either. Ventidius being so farre on his way to Parthia, as Tharsus in Cilicia, was there met by Artavasdes, but Artavasdes so chang'd, that you would as soone have taken me for him, as I should have taken him, for himselfe, but at length, knowing who he was, more by our Eares, than Eyes, we thought nothing could appeare so strange as his alteration, 'till wee learn'd that yours (Madam) was the cause of it, & that the change of his Face, could not transcend that of your Minde; but then our wonder ceast, or at least chang'd it's object, for whereas we admir'd before at his being so pale, and languishing, we now did more that he was alive, having knowne at Rome how passionatly he ador'd you, and how only he did value his Life, because you did, and because you had therein render'd it a Blesseing to him: He further told us, that since his disgrace, (which was the lesse supportable for having never learn'd the cause of it) he had confin'd himselfe to a Solitude, from which nothing but his enguadgement to Ventidius could have so long absolu'd him, and whither (having satisfy'd it) he would imediatly retire, and so assiduously solicit Death, as he was confident in a short time to have better successe in that Adresse, than in his former; that this course he elected as the only meanes to end his Torments; & your Cruelty too (Madam) having also left him no other way to justify his Innocence, which he protested to us in such moveing tearmes, that both Ventidius, & I, were abundantly satisfi'd of it; I cannot (Madam) but tell you, that being convinc't he was not faulty, I perswaded him often to immitate what he admir'd, and as you had elected another Servant, so that he would another Mistris; but alas, he was too-much a Captive, so much as to thinke on Liberty, and condemn'd me more for such a motion, than those Gods for acting against him, what had made me esteeme it a resonable one. Whilst I was thus speakeing to the faire Altezeera, shee was in so great disorder, that shee obseru'd not mine, which did proceed in no small degree, from my not knowing from whence hirs did; but the better to learne it, I thus continu'd my discourse. I will not (Madam) perticularize Ventidius journy to the faire Vdozia (in which Artavasdes, and I accompany'd him) and for whome he had contracted a Passion, which I beleive is transcended by none, but by Artavasdes's for you, & by yours for the Prince Pacorus. Neither will I tell you all those Reasons the vnfortunate Artavasdes vs'd for continuing in his solitude, nor ours to draw him from it, because I feare you are not enough concrn'd in him, to listen to them with that Patience, which their length requires. It is true Pharasmanes (said Altezeera) I should hardly have the Patience to listen to them, because I know they are but a continu'd series of that dissimulation, with which he has captivated your beleife, and did but too-long Mine, in so high a degree, that I shall not scruple to acknowledge, I once esteem'd, asmuch as I doe now detest him. Oh Gods (Madam) I hastily reply'd if Artavasdes be guilty, why then did you not tell him his Crime, that he might have appear'd so to himselfe, aswell as to his Princesse? which latter, if you had perform'd, I durst vndertake he would have bin more odious to himselfe, than he can be to hir. That which he did (said Altezeera) was of a quality, that to have told him of it, was but to have done that to him, which he did to me; let it suffice Pharasmanes, that I had the confession of his offence, from him that committed it. If it were not (I reply'd) a Sinne, not to beleive the faire Altezeera above Artavasdes, I should doe it in this particuler, for if what he did, was his election and not his misfortune, why did he impose on himselfe so strict a Pennance as a Three-Yeares reclusenesse? and why did he give a higher Testimony of his Innocence than that amounted unto, which Madam you will learne in the sequall of my Relation. You will doe well then (said Altezeera) to Prosecute it, for that which you have already mention'd, is one of the most pregnant proofes of his Guilt, and proceeded from a contrary despaire, than that to which he has ascrib'd it unto. I was (continu'd Artavasdes) begining to speake somthing Farther in my owne justification, when Altezeera interrupted it by saying, But Pharasmanes, I conjure you leave off all discourses of Artavasdes's Adventures, and continue your owne. This I found was almost as difficult to be obey'd in one sence, as in the other; but though I apprehended I should discover who I was, if I tooke too much Paynes to Discover what Artavasdes was; yet I could not obstayne fro thus speaking to Altezeera. Alas Madam why doe you take so short a way to make me Feare you are more desirous of Artavasdes's Guilt, then his Innocence. The faire Altezeera at these words turn'd up hir Vaile, and lookeing on me, by a deepe sigh, seem'd to reproach the vncharitablenesse of my opinion; but this shee did in so moveing a way, that in the Flattering dictates it inspyr'd me with, I was goeing to stinge my selfe at hir Feete, and there to implore the knowledge of my supposed offence, or to end the Torments of that denyall, by a reall Death; But somthing which was the God over my Inclination, suspended me that time from obaying it; And observing my Princesse was in noe disobligeing Temper, I resolv'd to make some vse of it, and therfore I thus continu'd. I hope (Madam) you will Pardon a Disobedience, which only ambitions to preserve my Freind from loseing as absolutely the honor of your esteeme, as he has that of your affection; in confidence of so just a Forgivenesse, I will presume to acquaint you, That Ventidius and I were finally so prevalent with Artavasdes, that we perswaded him to the Roman Army, and though wee told him the War would prove a Diversion to his Melancholly, yet we too evidently found he elected it, rather for a cure of his. And indeed in that Battell wee faught against Pacorus, though many strage accidents befell him, yet I esteem'd none of them more justly merited that name, than that he scap't with Life. Perhaps Madam you will be of my opinion, when I 'tell you (and that truly) that 'twas Artavasdes which faught against Pacorus,  & having bin Victorious over his Ryvall, he became his Defender against all the Roman Army, & at least as much hazarded his Life for, as against him; but Ventidius's arrivall hinder'd you from loseing that which you love best, and that which loves you best; neither can Pacocorus be more happy in the first of these qualities, than I am just in attributing the last of them to Artavasdes, who having only Life enough remaining to speake three or fower wordes, made vse of it to recommend Pacorus's cure to Ventidius, more than his owne. Iudge Madam (I continu'd) of the Merit of this action, which were I not too-much a Freind to Artavasdes, I would say, speakes more for it selfe, than I can for it. This which you tell me (said Altezeera) is nothing essentiall to what you would evince, since I never doubted Artavasdes Gallantry, but his Love, and that this performance proceeded from his concerne in honor, and not in me, I beleive you need noe greater eviction, than that he was ignorant who he oblig'd, positively, or relatively. 'Tis true Madam (I reply'd) Artavasdes was ignorant that he faught for himselfe in the Combate, and against himselfe after the Victory; but yet, if what our Preists doe tell us, is a Truth, that our good Genius's commonly inclines us to those actions, which though we then vnderstand not, yet afterwards approve; I may inferre from thence somthing of advantage in Artavasdes favour. But why doe I so much intrench upon the Merit, and cleernesse of his Innocence, as to indeavour to prove it by disputable inferences, when I can by evident demostrations? To hasten hereunto, I must acquaint you Madam, that both the successefull, and the vnfortunate, were carry'd in a deepe swoon'd by Ventidius's Orders into severall Tents, where the first thing Artavasdes did when he was restor'd to Life, was, to enquire after his Enemies. Neither did his care cease, or diminish, when the next morning the Roman Generall brought him word who he was; And though Ventidius did much admire at it, yet he had by much a juster cause to doe so, when after he had represented, that by his Commission he was to give no Quarter to any Parthian, and that by Pacorus's Death, he might have the blessing of Revenge, and perhaps therein remove the highest obstruction to a more transcendent one, Artavasdes was so farre from approvinge the motion, that he so absolutly disrelisht Ventidius for makeing it, as he protested, nothing but the giveing Pacorus his Liberty, could repaire having assumed any thought against his Life; & then vtter'd to many passionat expressions, upon that duty, which in spight of your Cruelty, he had still preseru'd for the faire Altezeera, that perhaps if I told you all the Truth, I might invite you to suspect I did the contrary. I was present Madam, at this admirable conference, and though my wounds were as many, and as dangerous, as those of Artavasdes, yet my Frindship never made me abandon him, and that very Freindship, and my ignorance of those Charmes which I have since discover'd in the Princesse Altezeera, made me esteeme his desires as strange, as I now finde them just; and forc't me to speake some things against that excellency, which though infinite, cannot transcend my Crymes, or hir Mercy, if shee pardons them; Yes Madam, upon Artavasdes score I perfectly hated you, and in those dictates I was often condescending to the Death of what you lov'd: nay I would have had Artavasdes done the like, and when he represented he had no handsomer way to obtaine your forgivenesse for what he had done against Pacorus, and to shew you the wrong you had done to Artavasdes, than to ruine the hopes of the last, to settle the joyes of the first, I reply'd that if you honor'd Pacorus with your Affection, he did in that performance but more certainly exclude himselfe eternally from so much as hope; and if you did not, that by obligeing (at least not injureing) you, he remou'd his highest impediment; besides if that were the Testimony he would give of his Passion, it might bring in question whether he had any; which beleife he would render a Iust one he prefer'd his Ryvalls felicity, above his owne; I told him besides, 'twas better to repent (if such an action needed it) for having acted his revenge, than for the omission of it, for besides the felicity of such a performance, the first sorte of Repentaince was a virtue, but the last a vice. Ah said Artavsdes how ill dost thou reason; If the faire Altezeera loves Pacorus, I had rather destroy my expectation, than hir Happinesse; and if shee does not; I yet commit a Sinne which vnavoydably will cloath me in a proportionate misfortune, & ruine my hopes, in the same way by which I elect to establish them; for by being the Murtherer, (or accessary to the Death) of Pacorus, I leave hir not the power, if shee had the will to reward my Fidelity, and Passion; and by removeing one impediment, I create a greater; for 'tis much more probable, Pacorus will dye soone enough by the course of Nature, than that Altezeera should marry his Murtherer. Above all this (said Artavasdes) I pay too-transcendent a respect not only to all which the faire Altezeera esteemes, but to what also belongs unto hir, to act any thing to the prejudice therof, & 'tis upon that score I have hitherto attempted nothing against my owne Life, which evidently evinces, shee has still a power over me, by being capable to make mine so great a Torment, and by then restraining me from ending it without hir permission: Neither can I apprehend any trouble from repenting an omission, which was dictated by Honor, by Reason, & (which is more than both those) by that Duty I owe My Princesse, which is the Name I must eternally give hir, as Kings, though vnjustly excluded from their Crownes, cease not to call them so, nor to have a right unto them, which want of possession cannot prejudice. He gave me Madam (I continu'd) as pregnant Arguments as these, which I purposely omitt, not only because the lesse reason was in his performance, the more it had of merit, but also because his actions will give you a better Carracter of his Heart, than his words can. But at last when the peremptory Command came from Rome for Pacorus's Death, Great Gods! you only know how it struk Artavasdes, but I doe, that his loveng so much Altezeera, and Altezeera so much hateing him, would have made him consider that fatall Order with lesse horror, had it bin sent for Artavasdes in steed of his Ryvall. But the formers vnfortunate condition hindering him to visit Pacorus, and to act publiquely for his safety, he sent for the generous Ventidius, & conjur'd him to let Pacorus escape, in tearmes so pressing, that I can truly say I was asmuch affected with them, as he which deliver'd them. Ventidius represented to him, how much the concession of his request would turne to his owne prejudice, but findeing that would not operate, he let him then know how much it would be to Ventidius's owne; This mou'd Artavasdes much more than the former, but nothing so much as did the faire Altezeera's satisfaction, which to effect, he afterwards sent for me, and violently protested that if Pacorus lost his Life, he would not survive him, since that was the only evincement he had in his power, that he was free from so horrid a Sinne: This resolution I readd as visibly in his Heart, as words, & acquainted Ventidius with it, who more concern'd in his freind than in himselfe, yeelded to his desires. Never Madam did I see Artavasdes so fill'd with Ioy as at that assurance, noe, not when he was in the blessing of your affection, which made me conclude he esteem'd it a more transcendent felicity to make you happy, than to be made so by you. 'Twas thus Madam that Pacorus was deliver'd both from Captivity and Death, and Artavasdes to avoyde the possibility of drawing his sacralegious Sword against the object of your Passion, did as absolutely abandon the Roman Army, as the felicity of Life, which for almost these Fower Yeares he has never relisht, nor indeed any, but what proceeded from this last service he has pay'd you, and which he earnestly enjoyn'd me to conceale from your knowledge, electing rather to be still thought Guilty, than appeare the contrary, to cloude and suspend your Ioyes. I had no sooner done speakinge, than the faire Altezeera with some Teares cry'd out, Oh Gods! Pharasmanes is all this possible which you have told me? I was goeing to reply, and assure hir it was not only possible, but true, when I might perceive Pacorus, and the rest of the Company comeing towards us; I gave Altezeera notice of it, who otherwise was so intent on hir Thoughts, that shee had not minded the Princes arrivall; but as soone as shee did, pulling downe hir Vaile, shee endeavor'd the best shee could to conceale hir disorder. I could not abstaine from repineing at this cruell interruption, for I was confident in the heate of Altezeeras confusions, to have discover'd the quality and greatnesse of them, which probably in a more settl'd temper, hir vertue, or iudgement, would invite hir to conceale. Assoone as Pacorus, and the rest had joyn'd us, he began by many Railleryes to make a Warre against me, for having so long ingrost the Princesse; but I had too many sadd and confus'd thoughts, to make him any frequent returnes of that nature, which the sooner ended our walke: But alas I had afterwards much more occasion to be offended at Pacorus interrupting us, than I then had, since for above a quarter of a Yeare after, I never had the opportunity of entertaining Altezeera without Witnesses; Yet I obseru'd, from that day forwards, shee was more pensive, and melancholly, than shee had bin, and if shee avoyded my conversation, 'twas more from a desire of being alone, than from any aversion shee seem'd to have unto it. All this tedious time, I past in more tedious sufferings, but at length there happen'd an accident by which, if I had not bin dstin'd to have bin my owne Enemy asmuch as the Gods have bin, I might have discover'd my Fate, and perhaps have found it as full of felicity, as now 'tis of Torment. The Prince Pacorus was extreamly addicted to hunting the wilde Bore, but commonly before the Huntsmen forc't him out of the Forrest, he would place himselelfe in a Stand, to Shoote; This recreation he one day invited me too,  & plac't me with a Iavelin in a Stand within call of his; The King, the Princesse, and all the Court, were in a large Playne which inviron'd the Forrest, but whilst wee were in expectation of the Bore, I heard a clashing of Swords, and suddenly after my name repeated, twice, or thrice, by Pacorus. I instantly leapt out of of my Stand, & rann towards his, where I found him assaulted by three Men in disguises, one of whome he had peirc't with his Arrowe, yet not so mortally, but that with the helpe of the other two, he himselfe was reduced to such extreamity, that apprehending I could not come tyme enough to his releife, (which truly I may say I embrac't without ballanceing) I cry'd out, 'twas Pacorus; my voyce was no sooner heard, than one of the three came running to me with his Sword in his hand, and told me, 'twas Pacorus they meant; this declaration made me meete him, which made it halfe way, and darting my lavelin at him, it peirc't him thorough, and thorough, and nail'd him to the ground; immediatly I seiz'd upon his Sword, and came so timely to Pacorus, that by the wounds he had allready receiv'd, he was even sincking downe vnder their burthen, but I not only presented him with releife, but victory, for one of the remaining two I found so weaken'd to my hand, that I esteem'd his condition vnworthy my Sword, if his Crime had not made him the contrary; and the other freighten'd by the Death of his Companions, was kill'd almost as easily, as he justly deseru'd it. The generous Pacorus, though he wanted strength to dispute his Life, yet did not, to come and acknowledge by words, and embraces, that 'twas from me he had now twice deriv'd it; but in so gallant a gratitude, he had so overstrain'd himselfe, that he fell speechlesse as he was performing it. I durst not forsake him in that extreamity, lest by wanting my assistance, his seemeing Death might have turn'd into a reall one, and lest some further complices in this facte, might, whilst I went to call for helpe, have render'd him past any; whilst I was in this perplexity, the Boare by another way had quitted the Forrest, and a Gentleman which waited on the Plaine came to advertice the Prince of it, and to bring him his Horse; but he was so frighten'd, at the strange accident, and at the stranger condition his Lord was in, that turning about he rann full-speed, and gave the Allarme of it to Arsaces, Altezeera, Phraates, and all the Court, and though thy suddenly came to the place where this Tragedy had bin acted, yet by some fresh water which I fetch't from a neighbour Fountaine, I had brought him from his swoond; I cannot tell you the generall regretts, and mournings of all the Company, espetially those of the faire Altezeera, which though they infinitly transcended all the others, yet they could not Mine, by observeing they did so. But after Pacorus's wounds were bound up, aswell as the place did permitt (which he would not vntill three slight ones I had receiv'd were drest before his, 'till he had told the particulers of this accident, and the service I had render'd him) All the Court, and my Princesse too came, and made me retributions too-long,  & too- flattering to be repeated; which were no sooner ended, than Phraates takeing some others with him, went to pull off the disguizes of those dead Traytors, to learne who they were; but their Faces were as strong a disguize, as their Vizards, being both alike vnknowne. This newes being brought to Arsaces, he had their Heads taken off, and fixt upon short Poles at the Gates of Seleutia, where 100 Talents were proclaim'd, for whosoever should either discover who they were, or who had employ'd them; whilst this was adoeing, a Litter was brought to the Prince, who was carry'd in it to Seleutia, but my wounds being lesse for number and danger, by my princesses command, I ridd with hir thither in hir Charriott, and there being none in it besides, after shee had somewhat moderated hir Teares, shee began a fresh to give me new Torments, by new expressions of hir Gratitude; but observeing I tooke no relish in them, which shee attributed to my modesty (but which alas proceeded from another cause) shee told me. If Pharasmanes your freind have still those inclinatios forme which he once had, & which you would still perswade me he has, I beleive he will esteeme you as litle his, in this dayes performance, as I must by it acknowledge you infinitely Mine. I am confident Madam (I reply'd) the service I have pay'd you cannot more satisfie you, than it will him, who I know, if he thought this were not really the faire Altezeera's Iudgement, would be thereby more dangerously wounded, than Pacorus is. 'Tis now Madam (I continu'd) that I must conclude my Freinds Fortune desperate, when that excellence which is to forme it, beleives surmises against him, more than demonstrations for him; and (Madam) if that which he did for you in the Roman Campe, and that which I have this day perform'd on his score, are not pregnant Arguments enough for an Innocence which ambitions no higher a reward for being so, than to be thought so; I leave you to judge, whether my despaire for Artavasdes be not too sufficient Grounded. Altezeera, who obseru'd I could not vtter these words without sympathizing in their sadnesse, & Truth, was so generous as to reply; If (Pharasnanes) what you tell me of your Freind, be what you desire I should credit, I will doe it, though perhapps the strongest motion which induces me to it, wilbe your satisfaction. Madam (I repiy'd) I had much rather you would beleive it for your owne, which would bring no small accession to mine; & which to invite you to the more powerfully, I dare protest by all the Gods, & by that which Artavasdes adores asmuch, that if he will resent any trouble at what I have this day perform'd, it will proceede only, from his not havinge pay'd you the duty. Altezeera blusht at this assurance, and as shee was about to make me a reply, the Prince Phraates (who ridd) came to the Charriott side to console his Sister; but his words could not so much doe it, as his lookes did the contrary, which carry'd in them so visible, & contagious a sorrow, that then I began to assume an affection for him, which the caracter I had of him,  & his earliest Actions, had made me thither to deny him; which affection you may immagine was not small in it's very birth, when it was not supprest though I had thereunto so much invitation, as his hindring me all the way to Selutia from entertaininge my Princesse. The Night that succeeded this day, I tooke no rest, more from the trouble of my Minde, than my wounds, which indeed was more hurt than my body; 'twas dureing the Night that I had more leasure to reflect on the admirable revolutions of the day, which forc't me to say, Great Gods! what has the miserable Artavasdes done, that makes you so ingenious to persecute him? was it such a Crime to adore what was your excellentest worke, & most resembl'd you aswell in perfection, as in tormenting me? was to be constant to a vertuous flame, a Sinne? if neither of these can beare that name, 'tis with Injustice that I beare your plagues, for I am guilty of no other offences: was it not enough that you made Pacorus ravish my Right, my Reward, and my Felicity from me? but you must afterwards constitute me his Tutulary Angell, and not only make me present when soever any danger threatn'd him, but make me also preserve his life, and in so vnfortunate a way too, as not in that performance to lose my owne; there could not be a higher torment than to save a successefull Ryvall, vnlesse it were to outlive that act: both these yet you have made my destiny, and you are not content with this, but that little satisfaction which attends so much suffering, you deprive me of, by rendring my concealment necessary: You can make me vndertake the danger, but you will not suffer me to receive the Reward: The revealing of Innocency, which to others is a recompence, to me must be a punishment as great as Guilt; for the reward which attends the discloseinge of myne, will be the trouble of Altezeera, and the banishment of Arravaldes; To continve neere hir, I must be vnworthy that honor, & to make my selfe appeare worthy of, I must be banisht fro it, if I remaine neere Pacorus, I am eternally destin'd to preserve him, and if I goe from him, I must lose that sight which preserves me. Great Gods! either put a period to your Cruelty, or to that Life which is the object of it, for whilst you continue both, you cannot make me more miserable, than you make your selves vnjust. These irreligious reasonings ended not, but with the Night, and the day was as full of torment though Altezeera did visit me, for shee did it, as shee hir selfe told me, to obey Pacorus; and alas though it were to me, yet it was not to Artavasdes; My cruell Fate made me still Artavasdes when 'twas to receive a punishment, but when 'twas to enjoy a blessing, it made me Pharasmanes. Whilst Pacorus and I were healing of our wounds, I receiv'd such incessant obligations from him, that I found my selfe asmuch ty'd to him by resentment, as by Fate; and the higher Powers did every day so farre remove me from my hopes, that I began not to dispaire, but thereby I should remove my selfe from their Cruelty: but I had no sooner form'd so flattering an expectation, than they immediatly ruin'd it, and by that infinite power they shew'd in tormenting, they manifested, they only wanted the will to oblige me; which alas I fear'd was as great a deficiency, as if both were wanting. That (my generous Freinds, continu'd Artavasdes) which I have now to tell you, will perhapps make you thinke what I have said, proceeds from my reason, not my irreligion, for though by an internall consumption I was so much pin'd away, that the Phisitians assur'd me, if in fewe dayes there did not happen as strang an alteration in one extreame, as there had happen'd in the other, my recovery would be a fitter subject for their Prayers, than Arte; yet I struggl'd with my infirmity, not to conquer, but to contribute to its victory; and therefore 'twas that every day I constantly waited on the Prince, & Princesse, in their severall Appartements, who were both so generous as to be infinitly concearn'd in my visible declination. One After-Noone, I went to the faire Altezeera, to pay hir a visit, but some of hir Servants told me shee was newly gone to Regeliza's, who, (said Artavasdes) I forgott to tell you, continu'd hir Mistrisses favour and was marryed to a great Lord in Seleutia; shee being in extreame danger in hir delivery, had passionatly begg'd from Altezeera the honor of a visit, since probably (as shee said) 'twas the last tyme shee should ever receive it. This Newes did exceedingly trouble me, because I knew it did the faire Altezeera, whose returne I resolv'd to expect in hir owne Appartment, not only as the distance betweene hirs, and mine, was such, that my weaknesse made my goeing to my owne, and returne to hirs, a greater trouble, than my attending could amount unto, but also I elected the latter, to learne the certainty of Regeliza's condition, in which both possitively & relatively I was not a litle concern'd: I had not continu'd two howers in this expectatio, when the Princesse return'd, but with Eyes so fill'd with Teares, that I too suddenly read in that effect, the cause of it; As soone as shee was come into the Chamber in which I waited for hir, all hir Servants withdrew themselves, and findeing they did it as duty to hir Greife, I was goeing to immitate them, which as soone as shee observed, shee told me, You may stay Pharasmanes, if your goeing away proceeds from any consideration of me. Madam (I reply'd) the deepe saddnesse which I too visibly perceiu'd in your Lookes, makes me conjecture the cause of it, is the Death of Regeliza, whome I know you too-justly deplore, to offer yet, or hope to lessen, or interrupt your Teares. 'Tis true (said Altezeera) Regeliza and the Sonn shee went with are both Dead, but shee has told me something before hir Death, which has but too-powerfully consol'd me for it, & which perhapps if you knew, you would confesse if there were any justice in my shedding some Teares for hir losse, it should proceede from a contrary cause, than to that you ascribe them to; I have (Pharasmanes) my heart too-much contracted, to tell you now, what it is that does it, but if to morrow you will visit me, you shall know what I beleive will invite you to excuse my not being able to acquaint you with it now. Altezeera had no sooner ended those words, than in fresh weepeings shee did retire hastily into hir Cabinet, & it being somwhat late, I did to my Chamber, where I past the Night in a thousand severall conjectures, what this strange accident might be; but it so perfectly meritted that name, that I was so farre from immagining it, as I could hardly beleive it when Altezeera told it me. At length, as soone as the impatiented hower came, I went to the Princesses Appartment; I found hir on hir Bedd, all alone, and in passions of Greife, which transcended those I had left hir in, which thereby I concluded had a high cause, when a proportionate judgement, and Fortitude, made tyme bring an accession to them. The Chamber (though it were day) had nothing of Light in it, but what it receiv'd from a few silver Lampes, and the Princesse; who as soone as shee sawe me, and that none else was in the Roome (which shee had expressely given charge of) shee told me, Come Pharasmanes, and see the miserablest Creature liveing, one which so justly possesses that Name, that though the Gods Graunted me my wishes, thy could not yet divest me of it. Would to the Gods Madam (I reply'd, struck to the heart with those sadd words) that my Death could restore you your quiett, you should soone, and experimentally knowe, there is nothing so deere vnto me. Noe (Pharasmanes, shee said) tis my Death, not yours, must restore my quiett; if any thing has that power; nor would I be long from receiveing that remedy, did I not apprehend it would prove none to me: I must Pharasmanes, I must languish in torments, for they are as fitt for my Crime, as my Iustification; but that you may know my despaire is just, I must communicate a secrett to you, though I apprehend your knowledge of it, I will infect you with so transcendet a sorrow, that it may even bring an accession to mine. Regeliza (the Princesse continu'd) findeing hir selfe past hopes of recovery, importun'd me by so many severall Messages to come, and visit hir, that at last I did it, though I fancy'd all the effect it would produce, would only be an aggravation of my greife, and no diminution of hirs, which alas, though in a different way, prou'd too-sadd a Truth: I was noe sooner come into hir Chamber, than shee desir'd all the rest to leave it, and then with some deepe sighes shee thus told me: I should (Madam) despaire of the Gods pardon in the other world, did I leave this without obtaining yours, and though what I have comitted be of a quality which was authoriz'd by duty, and extenuated by the event, yet I cannot but call it a Cryme, and nothing shall make me tearme it otherwise, but your esteemeing it none; which if you doe, I shall leave the world with as litle regrett, as if you doe the contrary, I shall with horror. Know Madam, that not long after Artavasdes went to Rome, Artabazus sent for me privatly into his Clossett, where after all those flatteryes which he thought most effective, he told me; Regeliza, My satisfaction and that of Armenia, now entirely is in your hands, both of them consist in the breaking that Passion which is betweene my Sister and Artavasdes; Whilst I considerd Tygranes as my Successor, I was asmuch concearn'd in the consummating of that Marryage, as now I am in the interruption; Whilst Altezeera was like to be a subject, I esteem'd none that was so, more worthy of hir, than him shee had elected, but since Tygranes Crymes both against me, and the Romans, has render'd him as vnworthy my care, as their Mercy; I consider Altezeera now as what shee shall be,  & in that quality, I cannot without horror contemplate hir placeing hir selfe in a lower degree by hir election, than the Gods & Nature have destin'd hir unto, nor in one performance so much injure my Sister, as to deprive hir of hir best Subject, to make hir selfe one. This (continu'd Artabazus) I would have told Artavasdes before his departure, had I not apprehended his despaire would have involu'd Armenia in new Warres, and that Altezeera was too-farre ingag'd in hir Passion, and Vowes, to let any polliticall consideration absolve them; I therefore elected to effect that by Arte, which I concluded was any other way vnfeazible, & therefore before Artavasdes departure, pretending a flame for a new Mistris, and that shee would not be convinc't of it, but by a slighting letter to my former, and an assurance of my Passion to hir selfe vnder my hand, one day in Artavasdes sight I so well counterfeicted an indisposition to write, and so extoll'd his Style above my owne, that having acquainted him with what I have you, at length I procur'd two Letters from him, to those effects I desir'd, & mention'd, which I said I would coppy, but which indeed I have reserv'd for another vse, for by their helpe, & yours, I make no question but to raise such a Fraction betweene the Lovers, as nothing but a miracle shall discover it, or vnite them. This (said Artabazus) I have done by the advice of Crassolis, who is confident (& so am I) if you will place Artavasdes Cipher on one of the Letters, & contribut to the delivery of it by a Servant of his, whom we have subborn'd for that effect, and who will leave him in his journy to Rome, it may shake hir constancy, which soone after wee may ruine, if the other Letter which addresses it selfe to his new Mistris, be presented to Altezeera by you, as miraculously found in Theoxcena's Closset, who we have thought the fittest person to give Altezeera a jealousie, not only for hir perfectios, but that Artavasdes before his leaving Armenia, so assidiously visited hir, though we know 'twas on Phanasders scoare. This will doubtlesse produce the effects wee mention, and when it has, I will enguadge the Prince Pharnaces, the great Mithridates Sonne to make his addresses to hir, which, in the rage of hir Lovers inconstancy, will certainly prove successefull, and when once shee is Marryed, I will not much apprehende the disclosure of the Fallacy. If (continu'd Artabazus) you esteeme of my Freindship, you will not deny me this proofe of yours, & if you value Altezeeras advantage, you wil graunt it me upon that scoare; Neither can your refusall prevent it, for if you should reject this designe, you will but constraine me to act it a more offensive, & perhapps bloodyer way; for I am determin'd (at whatsoever rate) to performe my intentions. This was the effect (Madam continu'd Regeliza) of what Artabazus spake to me, though he gave me more large, & pregnant arguments for my obedience, than my memory, or weaknesse will permitt me to repeate; but though I had the fortitude to resist his presents, and flatteries, yet I had not, to oppose that which he alleadg'd was for your Advantage; there (Madam) he assaulted me where I was lest able, and least willing to resist; neither could he have made me an Enemy to your desires but by convinceing me that therein I was a Freind to your power, & honor; I had this consolation, that nothing could make me prejudice you, but for your advantage; nor does a Phisitian merit his Patients resentments, for depriveing him a while of health, to restore him thereby to a more perfect one; But Madam, I will not so much as thinke there are any Arguments for my justification, least you should beleive there are none for my Pardon, for I would not have so sensible an addition to the Misery of being deny'd it, as to know 'twas done so against reason. To be breife Madam (for I finde my Death hastens) to serve you as I thought, to obey my King, and to preserve Artavasdes, whose Death was obliquely threatn'd by him, and who I thought you would be lesse displeas'd to see live in your hatred, than dye in the honor of your esteeme, and Love; I finally condiscended to act, what I could not hinder; but yet in expectation, that tyme might produce some as strange revolutions in Artavasdes favour, as it has done to his prejudice, and that Artabazus might be converted, I perswaded him, and Crassolis, (who was all this while present) that 'twere best only at first to give you the letter which was to acquaint you with Artavasdes change, & then a good intervall betweene, to present you the other, which was to acquaint you who had occasion'd it, for if they were deliver'd both at once, it might relish of designe, & besides the latter coming when the first had shaken your Constancy, it might finde the lesse difficulty to suppresse it. I beleiu'd Madam the first of these would not thrust you to what they both might, and that if you were not anothers, there was still left you at any tyme, in shewing you Artavasdes Innocence the Power to reward it. 'Twas thus Madam, that the constant Artavasdes was betray'd, whose false Servant Allaner presented you with that false letter, which had so strange an influence on you, and which I abundantly contributed vnto, 'till I sawe how much it hazarded your Life, by that dangerous sicknesse it cast you into, a little before Pacorus's beseidgeing Tygranocerta. You know (Madam) that dureing your indisposition, I tooke Artavasdes parte to make it cease, and you confest 'twas I which restor'd you to health, by restoreing you to hopes, that the cruell Letter had something of misterious in it, which I vndertooke to discover, and which I had done, but that your, and the generall danger, with Pacorus's transcendent Gallantry, & services, made me esteeme that generous Prince had a better Title to you in every respect, than Artavasdes had; and that to disclose wee betray'd him, had bin to betray you, who I resolv'd the Gods favour'd in no small degree, since by so strange a way, they lead you to so noble an ende, & converted even the very treachery of your Freinds, into your advantage. 'Twas therefore (Madam) that feigning once an indisposition at Theoxcena's, I continu'd all night there, & made you beleive at my returne, that I had found that letter there, which I had brought thither, and which I then presented you, with a superscription Cypher to it of my owne Invention; but alas, I soone repented it, when it cast you into that violent feavour, & I was a thousand tymes upon the point of discloseing all unto you; But then the certaine ruine of Armenia, and the as certaine of the generous Pacorus, with your miraculous recovery, which you told me proceeded from your having as absolutely banisht Artavasdes from your heart, as he had you from his, and your esteeming your selfe oblig'd, if not out of Love, yet out of Gratitude to give your selfe vnto Pacorus, silenc'd that resolve, by which you have enioy'd a felicity, that I hope wilbe no small inducement to procure a pardon for so successefull a cryme, and event, and without which, I shall leave the World in Torments, which perhapps will inspire you with as great a repentance for having impos'd them on me, as me, for having merited them. Neither (Madam) is it one of the meanest services my Infidelity has done you, to preserve Artavasdes Life, who without what I did, had tasted of that fatall Cupp, which has sent his Father into another world. Regeliza had no sooner ended speaking, than shee did hir Life (though shee seem'd to have something more of high concernment to informe me of) but shee had that consolation to doe it doubtfull of those resentments, which had shee liv'd, shee would but too-visibly have obseru'd. This (Pharasmanas) is the cause of those Teares you have alreaddy seene, and which can never cease 'till their source be exhausted; if I resent any advantage by Regeliza's Death, 'tis that it affoards me a cloude for my sorrowe, and makes the world beleive shee is the object of my weepeings, when alas shee is the cause. You see by this I am convinc't of your Freinds Innocence; and I hope you are so of mine; I am miserable Pharasmanes, more then faulty; but perhaps I shall not appeare so to Artavasdes, who may thinke my beleiveing him capable of change, as great a cryme, as I finde it a punnishment. Alas (Pharasmanes) I am in feares as great as my greifes; Not to let him know I have discover'd he is innocent, may continue him in troubles, as high as mine when I thought he was not; and to let him continue his beleife of me, is to invalidate this miraculous discovery, & render his hate, almost as great a justice in him, as misery to me. Great Gods! (shee continu'd) why did you not make me beleive Artavasdes innocent, when I had the power to reward his being so? and why did you make me know he is so, when I am divested of that Power? But doubtlesse it wil be a lesse affliction to the generous Artavasdes to be satisfy'd I want not the will, but the ability to recompence his vertue, than if I wanted both. 'Tis therfore (Pharasmanes) I have desir'd this visit from you, that you will by an expresse acquaint your freind with my vnfortunate Story: I dare not doe it, in apprehension my letter might miscarry; besides I am too-full of greife, to describe it, and perhapps of seemeing guilt, to be creditted; Tell him (Pharasmanes) oh tell him all that the highest sorrowe ever dictated, and tell him all that is short of Altezeera's, the greatnesse of whose Torment if he suspects because it has not yet destroy'd hir, tell him that that it selfe is a transcendent argument of its being so, and that I would curse its lingringe, did I not cherrish all things as a desirable justice, which punishes my vnfortunate Inconstancy. I beleive generous Freinds (continu'd Artavasdes) you doe not wonder, that all this Tyme I interrupted not hir discourse, which fill'd me with so much amazement, greife, & joy; that I had hardly life enough left to heare hir; but as soone as shee had put a period to it, I resolu'd to doe the like vnto my disguize; for I esteem'd, though the cryminall Artavasdes needed one to approach his Princesse, yet the innocent Artavasdes did not. 'Twas therfore after a short debate, prostrating my selfe before hir, I told hir, Your Comands Madam to Pharasmanes are obey'd, he has alreaddy acquainted Artavasdes with all that you have acquainted him with, & would to the Gods it had bin by Letter, & not Sight, for noe descriptio of Greife, could equall this evidence of it, I had rather have fancy'd it lesse than 'tis, than be so sensible convinc't of its greatnesse. Whilst I was thus speaking, the faire Altezeera rais'd hir selfe up a little, & having a while attentively consider'd me, shee said; Alas Pharasmanes, what opperation will this discovery have on the poore Artavasdes, when I apprehende it has had so fatall a one on you? This shee spoake beleiveing by the distemper of my lookes & the strangenesse of my words, that my minde had participated in the disorders of my heart; but I soone tooke hir out of that perplexity, though it cast hir into a higher, for I reply'd, Though this discovery (Madam) has a transcendent influence over me, yet I am not so happy as to have it increase to that height which you beleive it has reacht; for to lose my senses were a lesse misery, than to have them employ'd as now they are; Yes my Princesse, give me leave to assume that Name, now I have assum'd my Innocence, I had much rather be eternally depriv'd of reason, than have so much, as to finde it a Misery; you will be (Madam) but too-absolutely convinc'd of both these Truths, when I let you know that I am Artavasdes, who in the hopes of manifesting my Innocence, have indur'd as transcendet Torments, as could attend a proportionate guilt. The troubles you resent at this disclosure makes me say this, and I shall doe the like of all my greatest blessings, if they produce such fatall effects; Neither can the Gods bestowe any on me, if they must be built on your sufferings; Those cruell Powers know this Truth too well, not to practice it, and they are so infinitly concearn'd to afflict the vnfortunate Artavasdes, that they make the revealing of Innocence, as great a punishment as the want of it; I said this while I only reflected on the faire Altezeera's Teares; but alas, I had much more cause to say it, than I had when I did, for after I had vtter'd a world of expressions of this quality, lifting up my Eyes to my Princesse, I perceiu'd hir all pale, and mouelesse. This vnexpected and additionall misfortune, cast me into strange perplexities, and feareing least Altezeeras Women were too farre to give hir releife, I endeavour'd it my selfe, by all those wayes I had heard practic'd to recover one from a Swoon'd; but alas, all my attempts were fruitlesse, and shee lay with as litle life, as I therefore desir'd; but the horror thereof had so efficatious an influence over me, that what with my precedent distempers, and this accession to them, I fell into a resembling indisposition, and being upon my Knees on the Princesses Bedd when I went to give hir my assistance, my faintnesse surpriseing me in that posture, I fell downe by hir, one of my Armes also being vnder hir Body to support it, continu'd so dureing my Swoon'd;  & had not the sadd state wee were both in, evinc't the cause of it, I might have bin as worthy of Enuy, as we were of Pitty. I tell you this (continu'd Artavasdes) the more particularly, because of that vnfortunate effect it might, and did produce, for while I lay in this sence lesse but happy posture, Phraates came to visit Altezeera, & no sooner perceiu'd hir in my Armes, than he did also the occasion of it, but that wicked Prince, delighting asmuch to destroy virtue, as he should have done to prepreserve it, having first extinguist all the Lampes but one (for I found them so when I recover'd, and by what he did, I justly conclude he did this too, though I have yet noe other proofe of it but by inference) he went hastily to Labienus Appartment, which was contigious to the Princesse's, & there told him in a counterfeict sadnesse, he had made a fatall discovery of his Brothers dishonor, which he begg'd him to come, & be a Witnesse of, for otherwise the deepe opinion he had contracted of Altezeeras virtue, might, by makeing him suspect his owne Eyes, contribute to the prolonging of hir Crymes, & Pacorus disgrace. Labienus struck to the very Soule with this strange intelligence, askt Phraates what proofe he had of it. Alas (he reply'd) but too too much, for but even now goeing to visit Altezeera, I found hir in Pharasmanes Armes; It seemes the joyes and extacyes they had relisht, had mutually stupified their Sences, so that I surpriz'd them asleepe in the Scene of their lust. Labienus found it a hard thing to beleive Altezeera guilty of such a Crime, especially being accus'd of it by so knowne an Enemy to virtue, as he was resolv'd Phraates was; therefore to silence his malice, or his owne doubts, and feares, he went with him to Altezeeras Appartment, where his Guide conjur'd him to make no noyse, nor continue, least it might waken us; which Labienus having promis'd, Phraates first lookeing into the Chamber to discover whether wee were still in the same Posture, which he did, immediatly brought in Labienus, and so artificially interpos'd himselfe in the light of the Lampe, that it shone not at all on our Faces, which if it had, would have discover'd the Truth, but on our Bodyes, which confirm'd the wicked Phraates's fiction; but yet Labienus (as the Gods would have it) observeing it, askt Phraates why did he so? who reply'd, least the light by shineing in our Eyes, might wake tis whilst they were present; & then immediatly hearing us breath led off Labienus, who was so strangely perplext at that fatall sight, that by the strange operation it had on him, he concluded 'twas not fitt to tell it his Prince, 'till he was more recover'd of his wounds, if it were fitt to tell him, at all. Phraates as absolutely concurr'd with him in the first of his resolutions, as he oppos'd the latter, which he said was in effect to be guilty of Altezeera's and my Crymes; they being also of such a quality, that to conceale, were to participate in them; and that 'twere better Pacorus should know his wrongs, to put a period to, and revenge them, than by so fatall an ignorance, omitt both. Labienus on the other side objected, that if his Princes's Misfortune was of a nature, that to revenge would efface it, there would be two inducements to it; but since that which should revenge it, would not only make it publique, but indelible, & that the highest good, in such an ill, was not to knowe it (since there was no possibility of proveing a Woman Chaste) he esteem'd it handsomer, & better, to tell Altezeera of hir Faults, that shee might banish both me, and them, or by hir doeing neither, render the disclosure of hir offence so necessary, that the necessity of it, might render it a proportionate Iustice. But Labienus durst not use too-many reasons, to prove silence was good, lest that might have prov'd one to Phraates not to keepe it. Whilst they two were disputeing of our Sinne, I came to my selfe againe, & discover'd that which gave a rise to one of them to call it, and to the other to beleive it one; but the restauration to Life, had bin much worse than Death (where at Ieast my greifes had ceas't, aswell as my hopes, which had bin an advantagious bargaine) had not immediatly my Princesse too recover'd, for Nature findeing none come to hir assistance, went to hir owne; oh Gods! how was I surpriz'd to finde my selfe in a posture of felicity, and not in a relish of it? and how confounded was I aswell as Altezeera, to finde, how much more obligeing the effects of my misfortune had bin, than those of my Constancy, and Innocence; but alas I had much more cause to be so, when not only the Princesses Women came runing in to hir assistance, but when they also found hir in a high Feaver, that threatn'd to cast hir into an eternall Death, as soone as shee was restor'd from a temporary one; So many Witnesses hinder'd hir from speaking to me, and they begining to vndresse hir, hinder'd me from continuing longer in the Chamber, which I left, without receiveing any other fruit of my being Innocent, than the knowledge that it had bin more for my quiett, I had never bin so. Ah when I was retir'd to my Appartment, what did I not say against the cruell Destinyes, which had form'd mine so perversly, that transcendent punishments attended aswell my reall fidelity, as my seeming want of it? The next Morning I knew by the publique voyce of the Court (for I durst neither satisfy my apprehensions, or duty, by a personall vsit, or by employing any of my Domesticks to doe it) that the Princesse was in a Feaver, which by giveing so litle hopes in the begining, made the Phisitians with Teares apprehend the conclusion; but it was too- violent to continue long our suspensions, and I was satisfy'd of hir recovery, before any symtomes of it, by knowing the Gods would not give me so certaine a Cure of my Misery, as the Death of my Princesse, and consequently myne. At last hir Feaver left hir, when the Phisitians had done so,  & the generous Pacorus who had ty'd his Fate to Altezeeras, began to cherrish his owne Life, when he was assur'd of hirs, but 'till then, he contributed all he could to accompany hir; and the more certainly to effect it, he had seiz'd on a Ponyard which he lay'd by him, in expectation of the fatall Newes. 'Twas in this I disclos'd (and perhapps Altezeera too) the disproportion of our Passions; for I needeed but the bare knowledge of hir Death, to act my owne; whereas Pacorus to reach his, must have bin necessitated to make use of his Resolution, aswell as Love; It may be this knowledge invited Phraates a while to a silence, which his virtue would not have kept. Pacorus, and I, who were most concern'd in Altezeeras health, as if it had bin by a sympatheticall operation, recover'd our owne, proportionatly as shee did hirs. This was the cause that the first day I went into the Pallace Garden, upon which my Appartment answer'd, Altezeera went thither also ('twas the first tyme I had seene hir since hir sicknesse, or recovery) I will omitt my confusions, and my disorders, whilst I congratulated the latter, which as soone as I had, as if it had bin without designe, by degrees shee separated hir selfe from the company, & after having receiued some fresh convincements that I was Artavasdes; shee acknowledg'd no small joy that I was restored from a Sicknesse, which shee justly consider'd as a tribute to hirs; but being determin'd not to lose so happy an oppertunity to learne my Fate, which the Authres of it too presented me, I told hir. If I consider Madam my recovery with any joy, 'tis only because you seeme to doe so, and out of a hope that that Life which has by twice preserveing Pacorus's, 'twice establisht the felicity of yours, is still continu'd by the Gods, for the same end, though by the same way; Yes Madam, I am readdy not only to employ my Life, but to lay it downe in so glorious an occasion, though it were as full of felicities, as in those happy dayes, wherein my Princesse was asmuch mine by promise, as shee is now my Ryvalls by possession. But Madam, did I not conclude the Gods restor'd my health upon this, or some resembling score, I should esteeme it as transcendent a misery, as I shall a blessing, if they have done it for that end: Neither need I, for the only cure of my miseries be oblig'd to my resolution, but Reason, which convinces me 'twere a lesse misfortune to have Artavasdes in the Armes of Death, than to have him see the faire Altezeera in Pacorus's. The Gods shall be my Witnesses (she reply'd, pulling downe hir vaile to cover hir blushes) that if I yeelded not to my last Sicknesse, 'twas more upon Artavasdes's accompt, than my owne; who had I knowne him still to be what he is, neither the safety or satisfaction of Pacorus, Artabazus, or Armenia should have made me hazard his, or receede in the least degree from those professions, which his Person, & Services, but much more my inclinations, induc'd me to make him; but alas the Gods contributed to my delusion; you cannot doubt Artavasdes, but 'twas one, and not a designe; for 'tis not rationall that I should willingly act, what turn'd most to my owne torment; Yes (Artauasdes) I say my owne torment; judge then what that greife must be, which makes my being the Wife of so generous a Prince as Pacorus, be esteem'd one by me; I have liu'd purposely to tell you this, for perhaps you may resent some satisfaction, by knowing, shee that has divested you of all your felicity, has in that very performance done the like to hir owne. These words, and some Teares which accompany'd them, were so sensible to me, that I could not abstaine from saying in a higher tone than before. Great Gods have not you already render'd Artavasdes sufficiently miserable by the losse of his Princesses affection, but you must make him more so, by the restoration of it? and are you so inveteratly bent to continue me so, that rather than not act it, you will make contraryes produce the same effect? 'Tis now (Madam) I finde, that the endeing of my life, wilbe the most considerable service it can render you; You had never bin vnfortunate, had not the Gods ty'd your Fate, to myne; remoue the cause, and the effect will cease; That which restores your quiet, will settle mine; either of these inducements, especially the former, will give me resolution, and invitation enough to ende it: Those poweres can have noe more any pretence to afflict you, when you are as single in your fortuue, as in your perfections: 'Tis not (Madam) my despaire, but (if it be permitted me to say it) my Love, which makes this Motion; Nor can you give me a greater testimony, that I am in the blessing of your esteeme, than to enjoyne, or permit me, to oblige both of us in one performance. Can you then beleive (Altezeera reply'd, with a Looke which had something of resentment in it) that because I have lost my Title to you, I have lost my concerne for you? or that what will render my sorrow vnconsolable, will suppresse it? cruell Artavasdes, if neither of those are your Thoughts; why by so strange a motion doe you invite me to beleive they are? The Death of the innocent Artavasdes would much more trouble me, than when I esteen'd him the guilty: That was a losse which my then beleife would have render'd none; But that which he now threaten's me with, is of a quality, that if I can receive my consolation in it, it proceedes from the impossibility of my surviveing it. If madam (said I) the miserable Artavasdes's Death, could either prove a misfortune to you, or to him, I am convinc't by many experiments, that the Gods would have long since acted it,  & their having so miraculously kept me from it, proves abundantly 'tis a blessing. But my Princesse, what then will you determine of a Life which you would confine me from ending? doe not you then beleiue, that the horror of contemplating you in the embraces of my Ryvall, will make my Greife act that, which you would tye my resolution from? & having now manifested my innocence (which is not only the highest blessing your condition permits me to aspire unto, but the only, which made me so long languish out my tyme) Permit me (my Princesse) to dye in your esteeme, since I cannot in a nobler Felicity; and since I can extend my hopes no higher, why will you let me any longer extend my Life? he dyes not amisse (Madam) that has nothing to expect, or desire; and your condition, and your virtue, keepes me from both. Ah Artavasdes shee reply'd, you are not what your words would make you, one that considers noe one's felicity, but his owne; have you then nothing to hope, or desire, when I have told you the continuation of your Life, is deare, and considerable to Altezeera; I have almost asmuch cause to have spoke those words as you, and if I declin'd them, 'twas upon the same scoare which I beleiv'd, would have made you doe the like; Wee must Artavasdes attend the leasure of the Gods; if there be no cause to hope in reason, there is yet reason to hope in a Miracle, for they will not give so pregnant an Argument against their Providence (which is themselves) as to let so perfect a Constancy as yours, continue eternally fruitlesse. I was upon replying, when we found our selves at the end of a walke which answer'd another, where wee perceiv'd Pacorus with Phraates comeing towards us; wee therefore went to meete him, where he againe began to taxe me of that in Raillery, which alas too-soone lost that Name; for the next day, that Gayity which proceeded from his humor, & which might have much more from his condition, began to turne into so deepe and obscure a Sadnesse, and so constantly increast, that to let you know how vncapable it was of intermission, it receiu'd none in the faire Altezeera's visits, who so exactly sympathiz'd in his distempers, that shee even assum'd them by deploreing them; and the Gods thereby made me know that the cause of Altezeera's Sicknesse, could prove as transcendent a Misfortune, as the effect. This visible declination of Pacorus's, made what created it as visible to Labienus, but his judgement had bin so infinitly deluded, by his Sight, that what was a production of Altezeera's Love, he imputed to one of hir shame, and in this Faith so long continu'd that error, that his Princes Death had like to have prov'd the punishment of it. But the Gods who were asmuch concern'd in the preserveing the felicity of Pacorus's Life, as the Torment of mine, made the Prinsesse one day send for Labienus, who shee thought knew Pacorus's heart as absolutely, as shee possest it; shee receiv'd him in hir Cabbinett, which having lockt, shee told him. Labienus, That my Lord, and yours, has some stranger distemper, is not more visible to me, than I am certaine the occasion of it is to you, for whome I am resolu'd he has nothing of reserve; My reason would perswade me I am the cause of his disorder, did not my innocence more powerfully doe the contrary, for as often as I have conjur'd him to tell it me, he has only answer'd me in Sighs, and groanes, and thereby increast, insteed of resolveing my doubts; 'tis therefore that I apply my selfe to you for the latter, and to invite you to it, I attest the Gods, I can no longer be thought criminall, than I am ignorant of my Crime; the knowledge of my offence,  & of my innocence wilbe vnseparable, Yes Labienus, you cannot more certainely absolue my guilt, than to let me know it: This I tell you presupposeing I may be the innocent cause of his disorder, which only his silence, & the vastnesse of his greife make me conjecture; but if it has another creation, I shall almost be satisfy'd in knowing he could greive asmuch for something else, as for Altezeera, since in that knowledge, I shalbe convinc't shee is not the occasion of giveing him so much trouble. The Princesse told Labienus much more of this quality, who being therby covinc'd that he attributed hir sorrow to a wrong cause, to obtaine a pardon for that fault, confest it, & having acquainted hir with what I have acquainted you, added, he was confident Phraates had disclos'd all to his Brother, since nothing but a vast distemper of the Minde, could have so proportionate an influence on the Body, and that it was something reflected on hir honor, that he could conceale it from hir, or did from him. To vndertake to decypher Altezeeras astonishment, or greife, were to engage my selfe in impossibilities; but having a litle collected hir Thoughts, and supprest hir resentments, shee told him. I was not then mistaken (Labienus) when I judged such violent effects, could hardly proceed from any other cause but his Love; 'twas his silence told it me, but I had much rather his kindnesse had; that would have relisht of confidence, whereas this may of the contrary: I must too (Labienus) somewhat resent your proceeding, for if you thought me guilty, your silence to your Lord was an offence to him, and if innocent, 'twas one to me; but alas, how was it possible you could see us, and not see us fitter objects for your sorrowes, than suspitions; thereupon shee told him all that had happen'd, only concealeing my true Name, & the reall cause of hir fainting, of which mine was a consequence. This perhaps was not very difficult to be beleiu'd, for all the Court knew the high affection Altezeera honor'd Regeliza with, whose death none immagin'd shee would deplore with lesse effects; & that I had in the weaknesse my sadd condition reduc't me vnto, often fallen into fitts of swoonding, was as publique, & as knowne a Truth; Labienus somewhat convinc't at this information, but much more by that just charracter he had of the princesses virtue, began to suspect this was somthing of designe in Phraates, aswell as of misfortune in us; which he was the more confirm'd in, when after he had told the Princesse that the reason why he had not discover'd our Faces was, that there was but one Lampe in the Chamber, which also Phraates hinder'd from shineing on our Faces, least (as he alleadg'd) it might 'waken vs; shee told him, that there were at least a dozen lighted when hir fainting had seiz'd on hir, and that when all hir Women came running in to hir assistance, they had (finding the Lampes had bin extinguisht, and not gone out of themselves) admir'd at it, which shee too did, after shee had bin inform'd of it. Labienus having a litle reflected on this, confirm'd himselfe more & more in his former beleife, and after a short silence, ask't Altezeera who had given hir Women notice of hir misfortune. The Princesse having 'till then never enquir'd after it, nor had that curiosity, now observeing Labienus was very intent on it, call'd in Arismaze hir Confident, and having vnderstood from hir, 'twas a yong Courtier whose name shee specified, immediatly by Altezeeras order shee withdrew hir selfe againe, and then Labienus told hir; Madam, I am infinitely mistaken, if I doe not render your innocence as cleere as it is, or as evident, as that malice which has clouded it; Alas (said the Princesse) I am more troubl'd to have it suspected, than how to have it cleer'd, and 'tis something too-neere vice, to be thought guilty of it; besides Labienus that Noble virtue Chastity, is like the fundamentalls in our Religio, the highest are not to be prov'd, but beleiu'd. Labienus who burn'd with impatience to satisfy his desires, his duty, and his doubts, immediatly in order thereunto, withdrew himselfe. Altezeera, having a while seriously reflected on the intricacy, & strangenesse of the Adventure, and on Pacorus deportment on it, at last form'd a Resolution, which was to goe, & acquaint him with all shee had discover'd, and either suppresse his Melancholly, or by not being able to performe it, not esteeme it worthy the continuation of hirs. As shee was upon the point of executeing this determination, Pacorus came to hir all pale and trembling, but the Princesse could not be more astonisht to see him abroade, whome shee had so lately left Sick and in Bedd, then shee was when he told hir; (after having first begg'd, and obtain'd hir permission to lock the Doore) Madam the apprehensions I have had least you migh place a wrong construction on my greife, and beleive my jealousie for your honor, migh be one of it, has forc't me to come and tell you, what I have hitherto deny'd unto your Commands; thereupon he inform'd hir of all that Labienus had, and having added that Phraates was his Intelligencer, he thus continu'd. I attest the Gods Madam, if I resented any trouble at this Newes, it was absolutely upon your scoare, and not my owne; I knew you of so nice a virtue, that to be but thought guilty of a Sinne, would afflict you asmuch as any others being really so; that you would despaire of being thought innocent, when your way of Life could not doe you that right; & that you would almost esteeme your chastity a misfortune, since it caus'd as many Sinners as Vnbeleivers of it; This Madam by your virtue which cannot be greater than my beleife of it, only created my apprehensions; you will doe me but right, if you are confident 'tis more facile to invite me to beleive that Vnchastnesse is a virtue, than that you can be guilty of it; neither doe I expect any other recompence from this declaration, but that you will conclude I know the faire Altezeera, and consequently am resolu'd, that hir receding from virtue, is the impossiblest recession, and that noe cryme can equall the beleiveing hir capable of any. This generous, and just declaration, wrought so efficatiously on the Princesse, that shee reply'd, The Gods have in some measure repair'd the misfortune they have impos'd upon me, in makeing it the meanes of discovering a proportionate blessing. Iudge Sir of the vallue I place on the character you have given me of your affection, & confidence, when I can equall in degrees the joyes of it, to the horrors of sinne and guilt. By this generous proceeding you have lay'd on me as strict a Tye for the future, as my virtue has for the past: Yes (my Prince shee continu'd) this obligation is of so particular a quality, that you have render'd your selfe as vncapable to oblige me as highly againe, as I am of being so; For this one act of Faith, makes another as impossible, as needlesse; since 'tis not Faith, but Reason, which will confine you hereafter, to conclude, I cannot be susceptible of any impressions, but of such as may reward and merit the cause of these. Whilst Altezeera was making a Thousand such retributions, they heard some body at the Doore, which being open'd, they found was Labienus, in whose Face they obseru'd some Gayity, Altezeera concluded was not causelesse, and had much more reason to beleive so, when shee heard him tell Pacorus. I have (Sir) made vse of your Name without your knowledge, but I hope it will not be without your approbation, since it has produc'd a discovery, that cannot but restore your health, since it will your confidence of the Princesses innocence. Pacorus at those words became as strangely chang'd, as if Labienus had brought a contrary manifestation, and having furiously consider'd him, he interrupted his discourse by saying. Who is't has told thee my doubts of the Princesses innocence created my disorders? I now finde thou hast ty'd thy Freindship to my Quality, not Me, for thou couldst not have any for one thou esteemd'st capable of a Sinne, which would not only have render'd him vnworthy of it, but of Life; But that thou mayst not only know, but loue me better, I will not so much as listen to thee; there needs noe greater proofe that Phraates has ly'd, than his accuseing Altezeera, and the greatest Sinne next to that, is to beleive shee stands in neede of a justification. Pacorus, who found his Coller had somewhat transported him, begg'd his Princesses pardon for a zeale which perhaps might carry its excuse in its cause. Labienus though he were very much troubl'd at his princes rebuke, yet he was much more the contrary, to obserue what created it; and being more satisfy'd, that Altezeeras virtue needed noe justification, than he was to have found one, continu'd in a joyfull silence; but the Princesse observeing the latter, told Pacorus, I must begg you (Sir) to command Labienus to continue what you interrupted, for I am oblig'd to prove that by demonstration, which you have already by Faith; the latter tyes me to the former,  & the former cannot prejudice the latter, but confirme it: To beleive me innocent, after I had euinc't I was so, could not be more Iust, then to beleive I was so before I prov'd my selfe so, was oblidgeing; had you thought me guilty, I might perhaps have left your Sinne, your punishment, but your concluding me innocent, invites me to reward your beleiving it, by my proveing it. Neither Sir is this upon your score, for the way in which you have coferr'd your obligation, renders me vncapable of retourning it; 'tis therefore to satisfy the World, that I begg Labienus may satisfy us, for those that have not virtue enough, may beleive I have none, and I should be sorry, that my virtue should be the cause of other Mens Sinne; which was one of your feares, that your graunting my desires will extinguish. Pacorus oppos'd this with many pregnant reasons, but they seru'd only the better to illustrate his obedience, for at length he yeelded to Altezeeras Commands, which as soone as Labienus vnderstood, he told his Prince. After (Sir) I had learn'd that the Princesses Women came in throngs to hir assistance, I concluded they had receiu'd an advertisement of hir condition, and knowing as absolutely none knew it but Phraates and I , as that they receiu'd it not from me, I resolu'd it must come from him which, I was more confirm'd in, when I learn'd from Arismaze, that both shee, and hir companions, vnderstood of the Princesses indisposition from the youngest of the Palurus'es, whose eldest Brother (as you know) waites on Phraates in his Chamber,  & is not little in his favour. The Faith I had, that they were too- well instructed in their lessons to make a voluntary acknowledgmet of them, made me send privately for the yonger to my Chamber, from whome, with some threatnings, & promises in your Name, I drew a confession that he had bin employ'd by his elder brother, to give the Princesses Women notice of hir distresse. I therefore immediatly sent for him, and retain'd my Informer with me, whose Brother assoone as he came, and sawe him with me, fell into some disorders, which I determin'd was an opportunity not to be omitted, and which I did so effectually improve, that he confest to me, upon my enguadgement that Phraates should never learne it, that by his orders he had sent his Brother to advertice the Princesses women of hir condition. This (continu'd Labienus) I promist, because in the first place, I resolv'd 'twould be no small punishment to Phraates to perceive you were not mou'd with that which he was confident would produce a contrary effect,  & that 'twould be no small advantage to you to know your Enemy, without his knowing that you did so, which might in tyme furnish you with an opportunity, not only by standing on your Guard to prevent the effects of his future malice, but by surprizeing him in the attempts, make your punishing him for this, & his other offences, a publique Iustice. Labienus having done speaking, Altezeera told him. If this did asmuch evince my Innocence, as Phraates malice, you would then have satisfy'd your Ingagement, but alas, this does not the former, but the latter. Madam (said Pacorus) it is absolutly vnnecessary, the Gods are too-just, to let there be any other proofe of your innocence, than your innocence it selfe, it carryes it's owne justification so purely, that it leaves us noe way to suspect you can sinne, but by our comiting one. Sir (said Labienus) though I am absolutly of your opinion, yet because all have not the virtue of Pacorus, or the knowledge of Altezeera's, it is not therefore Charitable, that missing those blessings, they should be permitted to indure the curse of doubting hir Chastity; 'tis only upon that scoare I am solicitous to evince it, which I am cofident I have in what I have already told you for if Phraates beleiu'd as he told me, that the Princesse,  & Pharasmanes were fallen a sleepe by a stupifaction of their Sences through the excesse of their joyes; what needed he have sent in so many Witnesses not helpers of their condition, which needed none? & if he knew (as both their succeeding, and dangerous Sicknesses manifested) that they were in a mutuall fainting, what needed he so artificially have interpos'd himselfe betweene the light of that one Lampe (he had left vnextinguisht) from shineing on their Faces, which if they had bin asleepe, would have the better proved his allegation, as their not being so, discovers his wickednesse? These Sir (continu'd Labienus) had I no other inducement but my judgemet to cleere the Princesse, would invite me sufficiently to doe it; 'tis now no more Faith, but Reason; and this discovery makes me suspect who 'twas so lately attempted against your Life; for that Crime, & this are so resembling, that perhaps they may not be erroniously attributed to one Father. Truly (said Pacorus) you have made some inferences which I did not, because I was concearn'd not to make them, for 'twas more fitting, and (I am certaine) as secure, to credit Altezeeras innocence without any other proofe but the knowledge of hir Life, which has bin so immaculate, that hir past actions, are the Testimonyes of hir Future, as those wilbe of what are past; like Prophecyes, where things past evidence those to come, & those to come will ascertaine those which are past. I will not (continu'd Artavasdes) deduce by particulars all the passages of this conference, whose event so cleerly settl'd all misvnderstandings, that they all three separated themselves with that satisfaction which their virtues merited. Altezeera had the contentment too, to receive an assureance from Pacorus, that had he thought hir vitious, he could no longer have done so; & they then concluded to keepe the dicovery of Phraates's Cryme from his knowledge, upon those reasons Labienus had alleadg'd, who vndertooke so to husband this silence, as to make it of singular advantage. But alas this Calme created a Storme against the vnfortunate Artavasdes, for Altezeeras's scrupulous virtue by this accident, receiv'd so strong an Allarme, that shee determin'd at whatever rate to secure hirselfe in the future from a resembling one; but this determination was farre more easye to be assum'd than practic'd, & I had that consolation, & infelicity to finde, 'twas with a proportionate trouble to mine, that shee resolv'd on my Banishment. Two dayes shee was in this conflict, where (as shee told me) the Conqueror had nothing of distinction from the vanquisht, but the Title; Yet alas that very Title it selfe produc't as powerfull an effect over the Conquer'd, as perhapps over any which boare that name; And though Altezeera judg'd, that what shee was to performe, might create strange productions in me, yet shee determin'd to moderate their violence, by leting me know my Fate in some such pubilque place, that the helpe of Shame, should be added to that of Fortitude; or if both those were not capable to silence them, yet by the scene on which they were represented, they might relish more of the distemper of Body, than Minde; shee did this too, the better to palliate my design'd remove, which if acted after any private conference, might appeare rather like an agreement, than the contrary. 'Twas therefore one Euening, when shee went to enjoy the fairensse of it in the Palace Gardens, shee commanded me to waite on hir, & though many others of both Sexes did the like, yet shee singl'd me out so artifitially from the rest, that it appear'd not to be so; but though shee tooke much care not to joyne the Company, yet shee tooke at least asmuch to keepe in their sight; I observ'd both, & was not more satisfy'd with the one, than troubl'd at the other; The Princesse having walk'd a while in a deepe silence, at length interrupted it (having first a litle cover'd hir face with hir Vaile, to conceale hir disorders) by saying; But Artavasdes, what end doe you propose to your selfe by this way of Life? you can expect nothing from me, which you may not be confident of at a lesse hazardous distance; and if by your residence here, you should be discover'd, (for though you may disguize your person, you can hardly your Minde) alas I shall contract such jealousies against my selfe, that to beleive me vitious cannot perhaps be more difficult for you, than it wilbe for others to doe the contrary. This abrupt beginning, & the disorders which preceaded it, made my prophetick Soule soone fancy to what end they all inclin'd; and though I more admir'd this misfortune did not sooner arrive me, than that now it did, yet my expectations of it, rather prepar'd my amazement, than contributed to the suppression of it; I shall not scruple (my generous Freinds) to tell you, that I continu'd in as long a silence after my Princesse had spoake to me, as shee had before shee did it; & though (it may be) my persevering in silence had bin my best way of Answere, yet I could not abstaine from telling hir; That (Madam) which I propound to my selfe by this course of Life, is to evince, my Fire is immateriall; that which lives without Nourishment may properly be tearm'd so, & I have no hopes to feede mine with; Your virtue cannot more absolutly suppresse those, than mine does, my desires; The Gods too, by your being Pacorus's, having lest me no greater ambition than to enjoy your sight, & conversation, 'tis no small blessing to possesse all that one is capable of, and that the vnfortunate Artavasdas does, by his residence neere his Princesse; who cannot apprehende his discovery, his now Condition has disguis'd him better than Arte, for whilst the faire Alzeera affords him the honor of hir esteeme, and Civilities, he will be so farre from being knowne unto others, that he will hardly be so to himselfe. Altezeera who found shee would neede all hir Forces to effect hir designe, & who esteem'd Pacorus's late proceedings too generous for a cocealement, told me, all that I have told you, & then continu'd; judge Artavasdes if this merits not a proportionate returne? & if after this performance, I am not oblig'd by gratitude, aswell as duty, to that which I am confident upon either of those scoares, you will not refuse me. That Madam (I reply'd) which Pacorus hath done is fain'd, or reall; if the former, he merits not your care, and if the latter, my continuance here wil not create his; doe not therefore my Princesse, thinke upon a Banishment, which cannot more certainly prove the Death of Artavasdes, than bring no satisfaction to him for whome you intend it. That Pacorus's action (shee reply'd) proceeds entirely from the last, is not more certainly my beleife, than my beleife is true; neither is there a more handsome way to prove I credit his vertue, than to reward it. Ah Madam (said I) can you call that a Reward of his virtue which gives a period to the actings of it? when you remove Pharasmanes, you remove that which presents his it's existence, and so rather kill, than oblidge it; but 'tis not virtue, but Reason to beleive you innocent, & consequently 'tis he is oblidg'd to himselfe, not you to him; neither is there merit to credit, what not to doe so, is a torment. Yet (said Altezeera in recompenceing Pacorus's I doe but imitate the Gods: for though to beleive the Misteries of Faith in Religion, is only to beleive what we cannot doe otherwise without eternall sufferings, yet the Gods have allotted a proportionate Beatitude for duration, as the recompence of it. There are some virtues which to put a period to their manifestation, is to reward them: A Generall does so to a brave Comander of some endanger'd Place, when not to raise the Seidge, may be the ruine of the Defendant: perhaps Pacorus's gallantry is of this quality; at least 'tis an obligation to my selfe, to hinder my being perpetually oblig'd, which your retirement will performe. Though Madam (I reply'd) these Arguments doe not convince the necessity of my remoueall, yet alas, they doe how intent you are upon it: for Reason, and Faith, which are virtues that only have their existence in the Intellect, cannot apprehend a suppression, or neede a releife, as that materiall virtue Courage, may, & does. When any thing is fixt in the Minde, to resolue to maintaine it, is to doe so, since no Enemy can approach it there, without its owne permission: these being spirituall, scape those tryalls, & dangers, which things whose beings are obvious to sence, are subject to. If (said Altezeera) I should allow; that Reason and Faith, once fixt in the Intellect, are not to be remou'd, I should not yet conclude, that you are not to be so, But Chastity is like happines, it must be thought so, to be so; and alas how few are there amongst the Multitude, who have either of those noble Prerogatives, and consequently how fewe will thinke me what I am? Yes Artavasdes, 'tis upon your score, asmuch as mine, that I am jealous of my honor; I know you are asmuch concern'd in it, as I am; and since 'tis from thence I derive your Freindship, doe not repine I am so nice to preserve that, which affoards what I so transcendently value: An ill Name would more remove me from you, than my present condition does, for I should be then as vnfit for your hopes, as now I am for your desires: Wee must Artavasdes, we must parte; I judge what a conflict you have in your selfe at this declaration, by what I had, when I resolu'd to make it, and though in my sufferings I read yours, yet in my Conquest, I doe the like; if my Sexe could overcome this difficulty, yours will much more, for besides the weaknes of it I lose more by your obedience, than you can by acting it. Alas (Madam, I answer'd) all this proves your resolution greater than Mine; But my incapability but one way to obey you, proues my Love is perfecter; Yes (Madam) I say I have but one way to obey you, that is, by Death, my obedience aswell as condition, invites me to it; I shall satisfy you aswell as Artavasdes in it, and shall demonstrate I merited not the command of going from you by so well obeying it. Is Artavasdes then (shee reply'd) so much an Enemy to me, as he will elect no way to save my honor, but by loseing what is almost as deare to me? oh Gods! (shee continu'd) why doe you reduce me to commit a Cryme, to hinder him from acting another? Perhaps Artavasdes, your Death canot be more an offence to the Gods, than what I have now told you; 'tis an acknowledgement, than considering my condition, is a Sinne, which to have thought, nothing can transcend, but to publish; But I hope this assurance will preserve a Life which mine is tyde vnto, which I enjoyne you to keepe, and which if you doe deprive your selfe of, I will not live to lament. Oh Gods! (I cry'd out) I esteem'd You hitherto the greatest Cruelty, but now (alas) I finde Altezeera is: Those that gave me the necessity of Death, are lesse Tyrannicall, than shee that after hinders it; for they but impose on me a torment, yet allow me the cure; but shee inflicts on me the former, and refuses me too the latter: you cannot Madam (I continu'd) condemne this exclamation, for you are not reduced to the necessity of bannishing me, but reduce your selfe to it. Alas! 'tis not much Artavasdes implores; 'tis but your permission to languish away in your sight, an vnfortunate Life, and a life which you have render'd so; my sufferings will evince your Innocence,  & Pacorus can no more doubt I injure him, than I desire to doe it, or you to permit it: will you then my Princesse having denuded your selfe of all power to create my felicity, preserve enough to make me miserable? so miserable too, that 'tis as impossible for the Gods to make any so much as to make me more? Shall the vnknown Pharasmanes have enjoy'd a blessing, which is deny'd the innocent Artavasdes; and the discovery of his being so, must that invite you to punish, what you should reward? the Gods forbidd. These words deliver'd with a tone and action not ill-suted to them, had so violent an influence on hir to whome they were addrest, that for a good while shee continu'd in silence, and I flatter'd my selfe with a hope that it was a consent to my Petition; but alas it proceeded from hir not being capable of granting it; and I kept that hope no longer than shee did hir silence. Since (shee reply'd) that I have divested my selfe of all power to make you happy, whether it were my fault or my misfortune, I am resolv'd to punish it, and it may be your Banishment is asmuch upon that accompt, as on that of my honor; if you have not hitherto judg'd of my resentment by my losse, you cannot now but doe it by my pennance, and you cannot doubt I acknowledge my selfe culpable, when I volutarily submit to such a punishment; should you kill your selfe, you robb me of the noblest parte of my Pennance,  & would render the continuation of it as impossible, as just; If what I have told you formerly does not convince you how pretious I esteeme your Life, this that I have now, will certainly effect it; for I pleade for yours, though in doeing so, I pleade against my owne; neither (Artavasdes) can you justly appropriate to your selfe what you now did of misery, 'tis I only that can; for who makes a Freind miserable, is more so. You for your Banishment have the consolation, that 'tis to preserve what you love, worthy of that honor; and though I receive a resembling one, yet 'tis you conferre the obligatio, whilst I doe but receive it. Beleive me Artavasdes, my sufferings doe at least equall yours, but when I consider for whome I endure them, it gives me the ability to doe it; I cannot expect lesse from, than I doe for you, I have too, a firme beleife, that if the Gods have render'd me vncapable to reward your virtue, it proceeds only from its being of too transcendent a quality for me to doe it, and therefore they reserve it for themselves, since nothing but what is infinite, can satisfie what is so; & if all recompences faile, they will gratifie your desires by an extinction of them: & perhaps, 'tis more fitt for their purenesse to have them supprest by reason, than fruition. Ah Madam (said I, interrupting hir) this is rather an argument to fortifie, than suppresse my desire of dying, 'tis that only, since you are deny'd me, can end my desires, which though they were infinite as that goodnesse that esteemes them so, yet in the possession of my Princesse, they would finde a plenary felicity, for that which creates, is still more great than what it does create, and consequently you are more, than my desires; When the exquisite variety of my miseries makes me so religious as to thinke the Gods all powerfull, their having but one way to make me blessed, confounds that beleife, and at least renders it Reason, if it be Impiety: No Madam, since you assure me 'tis upon my score you suffer, & that you know 'tis upon yours that I doe, which is also accessionatly increast by that assurance, permit me to put a period to both our Miseries, by putting one to that wretched Life which is the cause of them. Since (shee reply'd) you 'tell me, the Gods can only by Altezeera make you happy, why will you seeke a Death which must make hir miserable? but I see (Artavasdes) you will finde Reasons to oppose Mine, and I hope you will finde none to oppose my Commands which positively enjoyne you to live; which to invite you too the more certainly, I protest I shall judge of your Freindship, by your obedience. Madam (I answer'd) there is a vast disproportion betweene being happy, and being no longer miserable; the first is deny'd me by your condition, the last by your commands, which yet I will obey, having given you irrevocably up the absolute dispose of my Life; This is a Truth you cannot question, since after your determining of it, I have as little the will, as the power to recall my graunt; But Madam, if by this cruell sentence, my obedience cannot prove capable of any long duration, be yet so just as to ascribe it to my want of the power, and not the desire of obeying you. The faire Altezeera was so sensibly mou'd by the sadd reflectio on these words, that I esteem'd it not amisse in the operations of hir pitty, to attempt somthing which might give me a rise to lessen it: & therefore with confusions, & tremblings, which made a more efficatious appologie for my confidence than my words could, I told hir; But (Madam) may not I (without Sinn) to so many miseries you have loaden me with, retaine a hope, that if ever the Gods by some strange revolution, give you as absolutly the disposall of your selfe, as they have of my Fate, that then you will setle it in a felicity, whose greatnesse I only now must know, by seeing of it in an other? I forbid you nothing (shee reply'd, with a litle blush) but the becoming your owne Executioner; Yet (shee continu'd) if ever the Gods should cancell the obligations they have now conconfin'd me to, I will never be any ones by Contract, but by Guift. The faire Altezeera who by what I had said, apprehended, that in those dictates the merit of my obedience would inspire hir with, I might seeke the reward of it, & that by yeelding to my request, shee might prejudice hir selfe, or by denying it bring an accession to a Greife which was capable of none, but by becoming vncapable of any thing else; insensibly lead me towards the Company, and entertain'd me all the way with consolations for my Banishment, which though exceeding pregnant in themselues, yet lost their efficacy with me; for alas! I fear'd, shee that could give consolations, litle needed them, but by that tyme wee were come so neere the company, that shee concluded I could addresse hir no new Petitions, suddenly changeing hir discourse, shee told me; If Artavasdes, the meritt of your retirement be susseptible of any addition, it will receive it by your ordering it so, that it may not appeare your obedience. As soone as we had rejoyn'd the Company, Altezeera stay'd not long in the Garden, but by retireing hirselfe to Pacorus's Appartment, gave me the liberty to doe the like to mine. I will not amuze my selfe to tell you all those Complaints I made against the cruelty of my Princesses Commands, which I then began to contriue how I should obey; in prosecution whereof, some fower or five dayes after, I caus'd a Letter to be brought me as out of Armenia from Artavasdes, to Phrasmanes, wherein the former invited me into that Kingdome, as being a fitter Scene to act a reconsiliation betweene Ventidius  & me, who had giuen him some overtures of it, and who was more troubl'd I had left him, than at that which was the cause of it; & that the effecting of this attonement would be very advantagious to my Freinds at Rome, who otherwise would inevitably suffer, for a Cryme, they never had committed. I fill'd this faign'd letter with many things of this quality, and immediatly after it came to my hands, I went and presented it to Pacorus, from whome I could not procure permission of going to Armenia, without an enguadgement (after having settl'd my affaires) that I would returne againe, which the better to perswade him, and the better to secure my selfe from discovery, I left all my Equipage and Servants at Selentia. I cannot omit telling you, that when I tooke my finall leave of him he told me; Pharasmanes, I hope you are very confident of Artavasdes's Freindship, for otherwise, what you have done for me (who I beleive you are not ignorant, have bin his successefull Ryvall) might invite you to suspect he sends for you to act his owne Revenge, and not to secure your Freinds from that of the Romans. I made him only an answer of my confidence in Artavasdes's affection for me, which I knew he would make good, and then tooke my leave of him. But as I was going to doe the like to my Princesse, I inferr'd that Pacorus's so sudden and visible recovery, proceeded from his having his suspitions satisfy'd by evidence, not Faith, for if his distempers had proceeded from what he ascrib'd them to, to hir, the same feares being vnremou'd the same effects had continu'd; but they only ceaseing, as soone as Labienus by pregnant evidences had euinc't the Princesses innocence, my opinion of his amendment appear'd to me to be no irrationall one, I am sure it had bin no vnpleasing one had it appear'd to me, it had bin Altezeeras also, To whose Appartment I was no sooner come, than I learnt, that for the two preceding dayes, shee had not stirr'd out of it, being afflicted with an vnusuall indisposition; I knew not whether to attribute this to an antedated greife for my design'd separation, or to a palliating of that sorrow which shee could not decline when I came to act it; for I was so flattering to my afflictions, as not to impute it to any other production. As soone as I was admitted, to my Greife, if not to my admiration, I found the Chamber full of hir Servants, and thereby saw my selfe depriu'd of all possibility of expressing my sufferings with freedome, or from receiveing any assurances from hir, how sensibly shee did resent them; perhaps I had in the great operations of my disorders, discover'd what I had thitherto so artificially clouded, had I not attributed so many witnesses at my separation to hir designe of restraining the violent emotions it would produce in us both, aswell as to leave no impressions of doubts in Labienus, in Phraates; and it may be in Pacorus too. I shall not trouble you with a repetition of what I said at my departure, since by the so many Spectators and Auditors of it, you may conclude, there past nothing but such Civilities as are vsually practic'd in resembling occasions; only I observ'd, that Altezeera invited me not (as Pacorus did) to continue in Parthia, or to a sudden returne into it; from whence I concluded he had not begg'd it of hir, either out of a beleife it might raise in hir one, that he thought shee had a greater influence over me than he had, by hopeing I might graunt that to hir Commands, which I had deny'd to his; or else concluding shee had really that power over me, he was not very willing to receive so sensible a marke of it, and thereby contribute to the establishment of what perhaps he was not a litle concearn'd to remove. I went afterwards to waite on Arsaces, who not only made me the same request his Sonn had done but also procur'd from me a resembling enguadgement: I found my selfe also oblig'd by the Lawes of Civility, but much more by those of obedience to my Princesse, and of dissimulation, to waite on Phraates, who so admirably counterfeicted a concerne for me, and in my remove, that I concluded from thence, the visible sorrowe he had demonstrated when his Brother was wounded, proceeded from the perfectnesse of his Dissembling not of his Nature; or if it were real it deriu'd its being so, not from the danger he had bin in, but from his having avoyded it. I omitted not to take leave of the generous Labienus, and the next morning after those Dutyes, I left Seleutia, only attended by one Parthian Servant, of whose fidelity I was not a litle confident, having all the time of my residence in Parthia, bin so assiduously observant of my Commands, that I concluded 'twas asmuch upon the score of inclination, as duty, that he was so, And to oblige him by a stricter Tye than either of those, to a continuance of his Fidelity, I trusted him with my true Name and condition as soone as I was upon the confines of Armenia; where I learnt that Ventidius with all his Army lay at Cerinthia in which place, he had past the Winter; which was the time of my residence in Parthia, on which he had made as sharpe a Warre, as a season that was so, could permit. The perfect Freindship I had for that generous Roman, and the proportionate concerne I knew he had for me, made me determine, before I did either waite on Lindesia, or Vdozia, to doe it on him, this I effected in my disguize, only attended by my Parthian Servant. I found Ventidius ready to forsake his Winter Quarters, in which he receiu'd me, with the raptures of a true Freind; and though they were infinite yet they could not transcend his admiration and joy, at his learning the miraculous discovery of my Innocence,  & the strange Artes which had bin practic'd to cloude it. You cannot doubt of his concerne in my Felicity, when it even made him Sinne against the Lawes of honor, and curse his Mercy to Pacorus, which had hinder'd him from removeing the greatest of my obstructions as the Gods had the least; and which by their having perform'd the latter, made him conclude he had asmuch sinn'd against them, as my hopes, in not having acted the former. I had much more difficulty to make him decline these thoughts for the future, than I had had formerly, for now in his beleife that there remain'd no impediment in my Love, but the Death of Pacorus, he told me, that he would now prosecute the Warre asmuch upon that score as upon the score of honor, or Revenge; I shall not lye if I tell you I was not only seemingly solicitous against this resolve, but really so, which I did out of a true dictate of virtue, though it may be the Gods induced me to it to render my sufferings the more sensible, by still making me contributary to them; but to be short, I did not cease importuning Ventidius, 'till I extorted a declaration from him, that he would not have any more particuler aymes against Pacorus, than any of his Partie, and that if he fell, it should not be by the designe but by the chance of Warre. Two dayes I continu'd with my generous Freind, and the Third, beginning his martch, I found my selfe necessitated to leave him, by an vnalterable resolution I had assum'd, not to put it in the power of Fortune, to make me act directly, or obliquely against whatsoever my Princesse honor'd with hir love, though thereby I brought an vnimmaginable prejudice to my owne. I will not trouble you with those expressions Ventidius made me at our separation, nor those vowes he sent by me to Vdozia, to whome I told him I would goe, to qualify a melancholly which I knew would be as transcendent, as impossible for hir to avoyde, by the misfortune of his absence, & of those fresh dangers he was going to involue himselfe in; since to let you know how Passionate they were, I have but to tell you they were made by Ventidius, of whome I tooke a finall leave, he directing his designes for Parthia, and I mine for Sattala, where Vdozia receiu'd me with a satisfaction which nothing could excell, but That Shee would have relisht, had I brought Ventidius with me. 'Twas there I told hir all those admirable adventures had arriv'd me since our separation, and by my sadd example gave hir an indelible instruction to beleive nothing of hir Lovers change, 'till his verball confession was the euincement of it. At Sattala I cast off my disguize, which made my Parthian thinke I had assum'd one, and who thereby knew me to be his Master, only because I assur'd him I was so; but I continu'd not at Sattala, by reason of a violent Warre kindl'd betwixt Aatabazus and Antiochus, King of Commagena, who had not only vsurpt upon the Armenian Territories, but had also entirely cast off that voluntary Subjection he had made vnto the Romans, which former I was apprehensive might induce my King to invite me to the Commands of his Armyes; an honor I could not be more vnworthy of than I detested, as indeede I did all things that suspended my Melancholly; & therefore I left Sattala, but before I did so, because of those fresh distempers I conjur'd the Governour of it to have a particular care of his Souldiers, and of his duty to Vdozia, who having given me a character of it very much to his advantage, as an effect of my beleiving hir, and my being pleas'd with him, I added to his former Commands, that of the superintendency (vnder Vdozia) of all Affaires, Civill and Martiall within the Province of Sattala; which the next day I gott out of, determining to leade so fluxible a Life, that if Artabazus had any Comands for me, by the vncertainty of my residence, he should not know where to make me receive them; Therefore by vnusuall wayes I went to Thospia, and gave Lindesia an exact accompt of all that had arriv'd me since our last separation; That excellent Woman was asmuch perplext, as I was satisfy'd with those adventures, apprehending that the discovery of that Affection which the Princesse Altezeera honor'd me with, after shee had disclos'd my Innocence would create in me new hopes, and that in the expectation of them, I would languish away, and consume a Life, shee was too- much concern'd in, to have it so much misspent. After a thousand disputes upon this subject, the result of all was, my acknowledgement, that the justice of hir Feares could not be greater than the impossibility was to remove them; And that shee might not be by sight convinc'd of those sufferings (to whose vastnesse his Fancy could hardly attaine) I immediatly left Thospia, having extorted the same promise from Lyndesia, that I had from Vdozia, which was, not to enquire of me the places of my intended residences, lest they might be necessitated by Artabazus importunity, to disclose them to him. Some Fower dayes journy from Thospia, there liv'd an old Gentleman, who had had his education with my Father, and who in the progresse of his Life, had so exactly evinc't the indeliblenesse of the impressions of Youth, that to Annexanders very death, his first contracted Freindship had continu'd in one constant height; & the cause why it receiu'd no accession, was, that its first forming was vncapable of any. Neither did Euphranor (for so he was call'd) after my Fathers decease, enjoy any more of Life than what he could not destroy without a Sinne, & what seru'd to punish his wanting the power of having concluded his, with his Freinds. This generous Man had retir'd himselfe into a strong Castle of his owne, though the benefit he expected to derive from its strength, was, not to defend against his Enemyes a life he so much detested, that he esteem'd his having none, a Misfortune; but to keepe out such as might have so lowe an opinion of his sorrowes as to thinke they were either capable, or desirous of consolation. This humor so resembling Mine, the gratitude I ow'd him as Annexanders Freind, and the affection as Falintus's Father, made me addresse my journy thither, where when I was arriu'd, I had much adoe to obtaine admittance; neither did I, 'till I had told my Name, after which the draw-bridge was let downe, and the virtuous Euphranor came with Teares, and embraces to receive me; I return'd him his Civilities in the same payment, and after by many assurances he had made me beleive he could neither thinke Annexander dead, or old, so long as he consider'd me; I enquir'd earnestly after his generous Sonne, who he told me but three dayes before, had bin with him, and was gone in continuance of his search after me. I was not only troubl'd to misse him, but also to doe it in such a way; I therefore begg'd Euphranors permission and obtain'd it, to employ one of his Domesticks to seeke Falintus, and acquaint him, I would waite his returne, where I then was. Euphranor heareing this Message, told me, I had taken the only course to make him wish for his Sonnes absence. After I had answer'd so obligeing a civility, he lead me to a magnificent Appartment, where he conjur'd me to live in the same freedome, as if I were in my Hermitage, and not constraine my selfe for him, since I could not possibly doe him a higher satisfaction, than to act my owne. Never man that was vncapable of contentment, relisht any thing so neere it as I did, whilst I continu'd there, for when my Melancholly began to growe importunate, to suppresse that miracle, I went immediatly to Euphranor, from whose charmeing conversation, I receiv'd a satisfaction, which I thought noe words had the power to act, vnlesse deliver'd from the faire Altezeera. 'Twas aboue two Moones, that I continu'd there in expectatio of some newes from Falintus, but at length my Messengers returning acquainted me, that my inquisition after him, was proportinatly fruitlesse to his after me; but though by his search he had learnt nothing of him for whome he made it, yet he brought me certaine Intelligence, that Ventidius in a great Battell had the second time defeated the Parthians: That Labienus,  & Pharnabates the two Generalls had lost their Lives with their Armyes: That Ventidius's Eagles had past the Euphrates: And that Marke Anthony had sent a vast Army before him into Asia, he himselfe as yet remaineing in Athens, whither the Princesse Octavia (his Wife) had accompany'd him, and joyntly celebrated Ventidius's Victories, where he had not so long continu'd, if some fresh jealousies betwixt Octivius Caesar and him, had not necessitated him to compose them, before his advance towards Parthia: That they were now fully ended by the meditation of Octavia, who (either to continue what shee had effected, or to give the greater liberty to Antony's Amours with Cleopatra) had bin sent back to Rome by him: And that Artabazus by severall Expresses made a scrutinous search after me, to make me Generall of the War against Antiochus. I can truly say (continu'd Artavasdes) I was almost asmuch troubl'd at the Generous Labienus Death, as satisfy'd with that Victory which had caus'd it. I know not whether my vnintermissive sorrowes, the trouble of failing in any thing I was ambitious of, which was, besides in a more sadd evincement, manifested in that fresh one of missing Falintus, or else a concurrence of naturall causes was it, that cast me into a Sicknesse so full of mortall Symptomes, that I began to beleive the Gods would repaire their cruelty during my Life, by the Felicity of a sudden Death; but alas! I found I was more charitable than they, since they only shew'd me the Harbour, to increase the miseries of not attaining it, for I was miraculously sau'd, when I had no more the hopes than desires of Life; but though the danger of my feaver was vanisht, yet my weaknesse still continu'd, which was either an effect of a Sicknesse so violent, or of greife, that it had not prov'd more so. An excellent Phisitian which the officious Euphranor had sent for in the beginning of my indisposition, attributed the continuance of mine to the former of those causes, but so much time as is vsually allotted for the recovery of strength after a sharpe fitt of Sicknesse being effluxt, he plainly told Euphranor, that he suspected mine did not only derive its beginning, but it's continuance from a distemper of the Minde; As soone as Euphranor had by intent observations made this his Faith, he not only came and told it me, but by such pressing conjurations implor'd to learne what created it, that I obey'd him; I cannot tell whether the strange accidents I acquainted him with, made him sympathize in my afflictions, or whether he did it as beleiveing it the best way to make his Councells, and advice more resolutely follow'd; but I can, that after having told me a long Story of a Freinds Amours of his, so much a parallell to Mine, that I receiv'd from it so much consolation, as to know my selfe not the most miserable of Men, he at length assur'd me, he had deriu'd his cure,  & felicity from repairing to the Oracle of Venus at Hidrapolis, whether he advis'd me to addresse my selfe, and then coujur'd me to beleive he was not a litle confident of my successe, since he could as a conducive way unto it, not only be content to lose my Company, but to make that losse an effect of his owne solicitation. The miraculous Adventure which Euphranor told me had there arriu'd his Freind, & the great Fame I had heard of this Temple, made me determine to repaire hither assoone as my health would permitt me, which it did not for above three Moones after. I omitt purposely all those generous Civilities Euphranor made me at our separation, & how pressing he was to have me take some Servants of his in the roome of my Parthian, who one Morning after my recovery & Resolution to Come hither, was gone out of the Castle, & had never return'd thither againe, which misfortune notwithstanding my diligent enquiry I could never learne the cause of. I will conclude all by letting you know that determining to live a Life suitable to my condition, I refus'd Euphranors offers, resolveing, since I could not either at Sattala, or Thospia, light upon the Faithfull Philanax (who I forgott to tell
