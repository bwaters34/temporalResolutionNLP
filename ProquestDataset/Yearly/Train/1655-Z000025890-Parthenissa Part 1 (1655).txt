 to Truth which makes me use this expression, for I cannot write Of Parthenissa so ill, but to write To my Lady Northumberland is worse. But Madam, that you may not conclude me a wilfull offender, which seemingly I may appeare, by a knowledge of the greatest fault, and then by an election of it: I have this to alleadge in my justification, That had not the Theory of Vertue, taught me the noblest operation of it is to pardon offences, your practice had: For I have found you asmuch pleas'd in conferring on me your pardon, as I have bin to receive it, or troubl'd to need it, So that I cannot tearme that a Crime in which you take delight, nor condemne that performance which affoards you any; Neither can you suspect this Truth when for the manifestation of it, I decline not so cryminall a proofe. Thus Madam, you may see I injure you, but to doe you Right, and publish my transgression, but to doe the same of your mercy. But since Parthenissa has us'd mee at a contrary rate, I shall not scruple to immitate her Example, and to render her fault as evident as shee has mine: 'Tis Madam, that shee offer'd me her pardon for this Book, if in it I would draw her Coppy by making you my Originall; But my Respect & my Disability rendred me uncapable of the VVill and Power of effecting it, neither can I better illustrate the greatnesse of the former, than by proportionating it, to that of the latter: You would not be what you are, could I have made her what shee would be, since to render any resembling you, were to injure you in your noblest prerogative, and to act a crime, which Nature has not, or rather could not performe. Besides Madam, could I have represented her such a perfection, I could not have committed that offence for which this reparation was prescrib'd, for I could not have continu'd the Romance, since thereby my Hero's friendships must have yeelded to their Loves, and with much more reason, than their doeing so, could have been condemn'd. There is a necessity in Books of this nature, that the beautyes in them must have some particular charmes the one above the other, but you possesse all those Graces in a more sublime perfection than any one of them, does any one of them; and I have heard Parthenissa professe with asmuch concerne as Truth, that if there be any thing in the Booke which beares her Name that relishes of the Romance, 'tis only because you are not the subject of it: Your beauty would bring credit to more transcendent things than are there related, and make that which would require Faith in any others Case, appeare asmuch Reason in Yours as that which confines me inviolably to the high ambition'd Title of MADAM Your most obliged, most Faithfull, and most obedient humble Servant, seldomer Read, yet I could not herein Confine my selfe vnto the Examples of others, but have rather elected to decline a Generall Practice, to follow my owne Inclination, than observe one, to immitate the inclination of others. Amongst my many Faults, I know none which had a lesse Disputed Assendent over me, then a Detestation to Readeing and Studdy, in which vast vnhappinesse I continued 'till I went to see the VVorld, and makeing some Residence in France, I assotiated my selfe with Persons of my owne Age, where I soone found, that he who was Ignorant of the Romances of those Times, was as fitt an Object for VVonder, as a Phylosopher would be, who had never heard of Aristotle, or a Methematician of Euclyd. This inforc't me to reade, Necessity performing what should have sprunge from a handsomer Principle. In the Perusall of those Bookes, I mett with the names,  & some of the Actions, of those Hero's, whome I had heard off, in the Scoole; This gave me a passionate desire to separate the Truth from the Fixion, in the effecting whereof, I became as much a Freind to readeing, as I had bin an Enemy to it. This experiment I esteem'd an ingratitude to Conceale; & I have cause to beleiue since Romances Acted a Cure upom me, thy cannot fayle of doeing the Like upon any other; & by the knowledge I haue of my selfe & according to a Proportionate Degree of operation, much more upon Any other, then they have done upon me. All the Readers of Parthenissa may wonder at my makeing of Spartacus and Perolla contempories, & that Artabbanes & Spartacus should be the same Person &c. But I hope they will noe Longer doe so, when I Minde them, that I write a Romance, not a History, and that therfore though all I Relate be not the Truth, yet if a Part be, I performe more then what the Title of my Booke does confyne me to. The Latter of these they will finde I doe, in the warre of Spartacus; In the warre betweene Rome and Carthage called the second Punick warre; In the warre betweene the Romans, and the Parthians, and in the warre termed the Metrydatick; In the Relations whereof I have punctualy followed those Authors, who have most celebratedly bestowed the History of those Times to Posterrity, and where I have found any contradictions (as in most Historyes I have found some) I have gon according to the seeming'st Truth. Only in the second Tunick warre, I have followed exactly Polibius, & the Excellent Sir VValter Rawly in who's Generall History of the VVorld, I finde more Harmony then ever I did in any perticuler History, of any Part of it. But to Evidence Chronologie is not essentiall in Romances, Virgill (who writes a Romance in Numbers, & who is as Famous now, as he was in Augustus Time) makes Aineas and Dido Lovers, when according to most Chronologers the Troian Preceaded her, at lest two Centuries and a Halfe of Yeares; The Former Living in the Yeare of the VVorld 2771; and the Latter in the Yeare of the VVorld 3058, or as Alsted an Excellent Modern Chronologer will haue it, in the Yeare 3077. I Instance this for my Iustification, or at least to evidence I Err by a Famous and Authentique Example. Neither doe I thinke but such a Fault may be Pardonable, when by it I Present the Reader with two such signall, and True Historyes, as that of Hanniball, and that of Spartacus, which doe both contayne things worthy the Perusall, especially the Latter, which Past ages cannot Parrallel, neither doe I beleive the Future will. The Reuolt of Matho & Spendius from the Carthaginians in Antient Times, and of Massiniello from the King of Spayne in the Present, though they are Admirable Actions, yet are rather Foyles, then Paralels to Spartacus'es, who from a private Slaue, after the winning of many a Battell brought the Empire of Rome to the Stake in One, in which had he had successe, Pompey might have Lost the Name of The Great, or else have had a better. Title to it, then he Deriu'd from his Afion or Priattike Victories. I shall not here tell you in what Places I have intrench't upon, or borrowed of Truth, since that might silence a Curiossity, the raising wherof is one of my cheefest ends in writeing this Booke. Neither shall I here endeavour to Apologize for Romances, for though I thinke I could say somthing for them, yet I am certaine I can say more against them, & so much, that had I bin of the same Minde when this Romance was first Designed, as I am now of, at the finishing of the Fourth Tome, I had never begun the First; And if I should continue the two remaineing Last Tomes, it shalbe as a Penance for having write the foure First. Yet I may say that this way of writing Romances is lesse ill, than any I have yet seene Originaly in our Language; for all that have bin presented to the VVorld First in English have bin Purely Fabulous; This contayning much of Truth 'tis like Ore in which the Refyner will have Drosse, and Mettle, and indeede almost the best Histtorians, differ herein, not in the Quallity, but the Quantity; at least as to the causes & retayles of VVars, sometimes even in the very events; Though many Historyans, write the same History, yet they write not the same things; now it being impossible that there should be but one Truth, 'tis as impossible that those disagreeing writers should all write that Truth, which cleerely evinces, that Historyes are for the most Part but mixt Romances, and yet the Pure Romance Part, may be as Instructiue as, if not more than, the Historicall; since 'tis not the Truth of a wise Councell, or Ingenious Designe which inuites Men to an immitation thereof, but the Rationallity and Probability of it, whither it be reall or Imaginary, had the Histories of Caesar or Hanniball bin as meere a fable as they are the Contrary we might yet have Deriu'd from thence as much instruction as wee now can, or doe. Besides, Romances tell us what may be, whereas true Historyes tell vs what is, or has bin, now what may be, is more vncircumscrib'd than what is, or has bin, and consequently affoards a Larger Feild for instruction, and inuention. But I feare I doe herein speake against what I have spoken, I shall therefore only add. That though a desperate Cure (for so I account of reading Romances, as an inuitation to Studdy) be not alwaies to be made use of, yet it is not alwaies to be declyn'd; That this Romance is the Idle Fruit of some Idle Time; That I haue euidenc't my weaknesse in Print but to let those Freinds see the Power they have ouer me, which could inuite me to it; And in the Last place I must desire the Reader to mend the faults in the Printing, which I cannot but conclude are too many since they almost equall those in the VVriting. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PARTE THE FIRST BOOKE. when a Stranger richly Arm'd,  & proportionatly blest with all the gifts of nature, and education alighted at the Temple of Hireapolis in Siria where the Queene of Love had settled an Oracle, as famous as the Deity to whom it was consecrated. The stranger having disarm'd himselfe & learn't the unusuall silence of the Goddesse, commanded his servant to enquire out some retired lodging for him, which whilst he was doeing, his master walk't about that sacred place, without so much as considering the beauty, and rarenesse of the structure, and with so languishiug and carelesse a pace, that those which consider'd it, easily judg'd, 'twas chiefely the distempers of his minde, which had so strong an influence over his body. Amongst many that were so employd Callimmachus, the Prince of that holy Society, was so ravisht with those charmes, which in spight of fortunes cruelties, did yet inhabit his face & shape, & so strangely sympathis'd in those crosses, whose effects were not more apparent, than their causes unknowne; that he could not abstaine from interrupting the Strangers melancholly, by going to salute him, where after those civilities which are usually practic'd in such encounters, hee invited him into a lesse frequented walke than that hee had chosen; The stranger inform'd of his quality, and profession, was unwilling to be uncivill to either, and therefore obayde his Invitation, but had far rather employ'd the time of the Oracles silence in the entertainment of his thoughts, though they never permitted him so much as a good expectation, alwayes representing his hopes and feares through a false Opticke, which had so Transendently alter'd him, that if the Gods could have been mistaken in the infliction of their punishments, so strange a change had made them doubt, they had bin so in him. The good Callimmachus, who judged by the reliques what the perfection had bin, lead him purposely alone into a solitary walke to learne his Adventures, & perceiveing the unintermissivenes of his melancholy, he tooke that for the rise, and told him, I have had no small dispute Sir with my selfe, before I resolv'd to begg of you a relation of your life, for I know by experience that the repetition of a misfortune is a new one, but the great Goddesse whose unworthy Priest I am, hath often raisd a curiosity in mee to learne the adventures of many who come to consult her Oracle, and afterwards has inspir'd me with such advice, that from thence they have deriv'd their future happinesse; and I am strongly perswaded you may enjoy an advantage equall unto many others, if you will furnish mee with a resembling meanes. Alas Sir, the Stranger reply'd, though I am confident your Goddesses favours to you are great, and that your judgement is so, yet the higher Powers have so incessantly persecuted me, that my folly would proportionate my misfortunes, did I expect any ease but in the Grave, neither do I know whether then I shall be at quiet, for sleepe being the Image of death, and my Dreames tormenting me as much as my Thoughts, I may with too much reason suspect, that what is the remedy of all afflictions to others, will loose that property where I am concern'd. The vertuous Callimmachus here interrupted him by saying, I shall not much wonder that your miseries are great, since your diffidence of the Gods is so: They are never more offended than when men dispaire of their providence, nor readier to assist, than when there is no visible reliefe and yet a firme relyance on it: the Deity being never more apparent than in doeing things aswell beyond the Expectation as the Desert of Man. Then taking the Stranger by the hand, he begg'd his pardon for so necessary an interruption, beseeching him to believe that great Truth, which both his profession and experience made him utter. The Stranger found this reprehension to be as just as civill, and after haveing assur'd Callimmachus that 'twas his melancholly (not he) that had offended, did offer him as a Penance to relate his Fortunes. Callimmachus being highly satisfied with it, answerd him; you see how much the Gods are pleasd with those which assume their quarrell, for my performing it has not onely produc'd the ambition'd effect of making you perceive your fault, but hath besides procured an engagement: I was almost as impatient of, and would it might please those Powers to give me the meanes as certainly to remedy your misfortunes, as I am confident I shall be a sharer in them. By that time this Civility was answer'd, they were come into a walke so cover'd with Yew and Cypresse, that it appear'd a fit Scene for so sad a Story, where Callimmachus silence made the Stranger begin this ensueing Relation. publish than conceale who I am, since I might finde by divulging my selfe that Cure from my enemyes resentments the Gods have hinder'd my owne from performing, yet because they have commanded me to learne my destiny from this Oracle, I am determin'd not to contribute any thing which probably may hinder it, and if by that answer it gives me I find my Death as necessary as now I believe it I had rather also elect to be oblig'd to my own hands for my Cure, than to those of my enemyes; 'tis upon these considerations onely that before I proceed any further I must beg your secrecy, my actions as you will understand by the sequell of my discourse, having raisd me enemyes whose power is as great as their malice. Calimmachus would here have made him a protestation of that inviolable silence hee desir'd, but the generous Stranger would not permit him, believing himselfe sufficiently certaine of it, by haveing acquainted him how necessary it was: and therefore not to give the holy Priest any time for so needlesse an assurance, he thus continu'd his story. My name is Artabbanes, I was borne in the Reigne of Orodes the present King of Parthia, who is also called Arsaces (which is the name appropriated to all those Kings in honor to Arsaces the first founder of that Monarchy) I had my education with Orodes eldest sonne, the prince Pacorus, whose favour I possest in no unconsiderable degree, while I had the honor to be neere him. My Father whose name is Moneses might now by a just succession weare the Crowne of Media, did not a nobler principle invite him to decline it, he was Vncle to Tygranes the last King of that flourishing Countrey, and only Brother to Tyridates his Father, who by the infusions of evill Councellors had received so great a jealousie of mine, that to vindicate his innocency, and to remove his Brothers suspitions, he retir'd into Parthia, where Orodes entertainment was worthy the great blood of the Arsacides, of which Moneses had the honor to be descended, and in a short time, gave him his onely Sister the Princesse Ebuzara, who haveing presented my Father first with the unfortunate Artabbanes and (three yeares after) with Lindadory, she dyed, but Arsaces affection for her husband did nor, and he multiplyed his favours on my Sister and I so abundantly; that a long while we little found the want of so excellent a Mother, his transcendent care so well supplying that losse. Moneses had his education among the Grecians, whose customes hee so highly valu'd, that I was no sooner fit to learne, than he had by liberall pensions procured many of that Countrey to render my education perfect, in all which exercises, aswell of the minde as of the body, those that flatter'd me would say, I was no ill proficient. One day as I was waiting on the King, there came in a Lady in mourning, who presented a petition to him, But oh Gods, with so much majesty & humility together, that I admir'd how two such distant things could meete in one subject her Eyes had an Antipathy to the libertys of our Sex, distroying all those that beheld them, her shape and motion had peculiar charmes, and she had a certaine vivacity and aire in her countenance, that assur'd me her wit was not inferiour to her beauty, and yet one might easily perceive, that Time, which is the ruine of all other Faces, would but improve hers, shee being not then above fifteen yeares old. I must ingenuously confesse, my heart by some extraordinary motions foretold proportionate events, and the sight of so many perfections, made mee inquisitive of her Name which possest them: A Courtier who stood by, soone satisfyed my curiosity, by acquainting me her name was Parthenissa, that she was the only Heire of the Generous Miraxtorses who had been long Generall of the Parthians, that this young Princesse petitition'd the King for a continuation of that Principallity which had been enjoyed by her Father, who from all his services and victories deriv'd no other advantage, than the honor of acting them, and at his death had left no other wealth behind him, but that of a high Reputation; while the King was reading her petition I tooke the opportunity of saluting her, and after some little civilitys of telling her, Madam, I finde two things since my coming into this Chamber worthy of my wonder, that Miraxtorses deserts should petition for a reward, and that you should present it, or if I am singular in both these causes of admiration, I have a third, in which I shall have as many of my opinion, as beholders of what creates it; If Sir shee replyde (with a little rednesse) I had no better hope of successe in my desires to the first, than I have no pretence to the last cause of your admiration, I should dispaire of my Request, or at least onely expect that from the Kings favour, which I now assure my selfe to receive from his Iustice. Madam (said I) you have so good a Title both to what you petition for, and to all I ascribe unto you, that I shall thinke you doe more wrong the faire Parthenissa by disclayming so great a Truth, than Fortune has, by necessitating you to desire, or Arsaces can, though he declin'd granting it; which least hee should, I humbly begg you not to refuse the duty of my friends or my interceding with him. Then without staying for her consent, least she should reject the first proffer of my service, I went immediatly blushing and trembling to my Father, who then came in, and besought him to imploy his power with Orodes, in a cause so worthy his solliciting, and his Kings concession. Moneses who was alwayes inclin'd to actions of this Quallity, so powerfully perswaded Arsaces to grant the faire Parthenissa's request, that he did it. You may easily imagine I receiv'd no small contentment in this little service, especially when after I had begg'd her to accept it as an earnest of what I was confin'd to pay her, me thought her blushes plac't a true interpretation on my meaning: But after that little disorder was past, whether to disguise it, or out of a true sence of what she was then goeing to say, I cannot tell; but I can, that her answer was, My obligation to you (Sir) is so extreame great, that it makes me almost question the Kings justice or my Fathers merits which needed so powerfull an intercessor. I had no leasure to reply, for Arsaces retir'd into his Cabinet, and she to her own house, whither I desired to waite on her, but she would permit me to doe so, no farther then to her Charriot. I withdrew my selfe immediatly after to my owne Appartment, and passed the rest of the day with some impatience, longing for a Darknesse equall to that which began to Diffuse it selfe over my Thoughts, that I might the more uninterruptedly entertaine them. As soone as I was a-bed, insteed of that rest I usually tooke, I found mine was Disturbed by a Throng of Assailiants. But Parthenissa's beauty had assum'd so transcendent an Empire over my memory, that my reflections on it, almost suppressed all others; which made me begin to imagine it was Love, by my then resenting what I had heard of it. I must confesse this did somewhat surprize me, for my Governour had imbued me with so bad a character of that passion (he being a Stoick) that I fear'd it almost as much as I admir'd Parthenissa; which made me call into my memory all those Antidotes he had given me, As the poorenes of submitting to a Sexe the Gods had given ours the authority over: The vast troubles in purchasing our desires: The smallnes (comonly) of the value, if obtain'd: or the naturall inconstancy of Women, which by depriving us of a known felicity renders the losse the greater. That by the definition of Love, the Chase is a greater happinesse that the Quarry; for love is a desire, and we never desire that which we enjoy, therefore with the fruition the Love ceases, so that since the best of Love, is to be ill, but to be well againe, who would be a Votary to that Passion? Many other arguments my memory would have furnisht me withall, had not the growing Idea of Parthenissa's beauty made them Vanish; and then my reason taking her Defence, furnisht me with these Answers. That the Precedency our Sex had over hers, was rather an Assumption of our owne, then a Concession of the Gods, for amongst those Creatures which purely observe the Dictates of Nature, and can neither Lye, nor Dissemble, the Feminine Sex, is courted by the Masculine, or if the Divine Law gave the last the preheminence over the first, yet the Law of Custome did suspend it. That the consideration of troubles to a minde capable of so high a Designe as the adoring of Parthenissa; should rather inflame, than diminish the courage. In what darknesse had the world liv'd, if difficulty had not rather added too, then supprest the Desires of generous undertakings: As for the smallnesse of the value if obtain'd; that is not the fault of Love, but of Choyce. That Inconstancy, is not hereditary to the Sexe, the examples of Lucretia & many others sufficiently evidencing, that is not their Nature, but their Vice: That it would be a difficult thing to perswade a man who might grow rich, out of that desire, from an apprehension that if he became poore againe his losse would be the more unsupportable. And lastly to Loves being a desire which ceaseth with fruition; we might as justly say, that a Marchant which courts Wealth, and makes his life his trouble to obtaine it, when hee has his end, may as properly be called poore, as an enjoying Lover, by fruition, ceases to be one; for when he once has the possession, so many unfancy'd joyes disclose themselves, that they affoard sufficient nourishment to preserve, if not increase the fire; and the desire of the continuance of that happines does still maintain love, if love were only a desire; For fruition is not like lightning, that vanishes so soone as it appeares, but as the Elizian Ioyes, whose greatnesse consists in the duration; so that Love is better in the Quarry, than in the Chase, yet the latter is happinesse too, onely as the meanes, but Fruition perfect happines as the end. I tell you these little Reasonings, not that I esteeme them worthy your attention, but to acquaint you with Parthenissa's power, since to captivate a heart that had no aversion to love, is as common, as to subdue one so preposest with a prejudicate opinion of it was only fit for Parthenissa's Beauty, in which all vertues were so evident that I needed not the helpe of time, but of sight to disclose them. I will not trouble you any more in telling you how long it was before I did submit, since at last I was necessitated to it; and had no sooner resolv'd there was no Meane betweene my misery, and her favour; but I apply'd my selfe to all wayes I imagin'd might render mee the least unworthy of it: And to shew how much the Gods contributed to the growth of this passion, there fell out after many revolutions, an accident (even when my sufferings must have disclos'd what I had bought my words to Conceale) which did not onely acquaint her with the greatnesse of my Flame, but did also inspire her with one which has since proved so fatall to us both. There was an Ancient custome in Parthia to celebrate the Anniversary of the Kings Coronation, with all the shewes of magnificence, and joy, which the Art, or Affections of the people could invent: and because the Parthians were ever esteem'd the Warlikest nation in the whole world, to continue that just reputation, they declin'd all those effeminacyes which are so predominant in other Courts, and absolutely addicted themselves to such martiall exercises as are nothing lesse pleasing and delightfull than the others, and yet fit and prepare men more for the reall use of Armes and acquisition of Glory,: 'Twas this practice, which made the Youth about the Court, to publish over all Asia a solemne Tilting, where such as had any skill and courage were invited to shew them, by divers Heraulds expressely sent into all the Kingdoms of the East: And though this was more upon Gallantry, than any other score, and that the lawes of it extended only to breaking of Launces; yet there happen'd an Accident which wholly subverted the first intention of so innocent a meeting. The exercises of it were to last three dayes, and Fortune, to evince her blindnes had permitted me the two first to remaine victorious: But as I was coming out of the Lists, attended by the acclamtions, and company of my friends, wee heard a great noyse of Trumpetts and Clairrons, which imposed on us a generall stop, and silence; The King too and all the Court, at soe unexpected Musick, return'd to their seates to learne the cause of it; Their curiosity was soone satisfyd by the appearing of Fower and Twenty Blackamoore Pages, richly cloath'd, and well horst, who carried each of them at the end of an Ebony Stick tip't with gold, the severall picture of some excellent Beauty; These were followed by their Master, who was advantagiously mounted, and whose Helmet being open'd, discouer'd a Face more capable to creat Feare, than any other passion; & yet even in those barbarous features, there was an ample evidence of a resembling courage & magnanimity; As soone as he was come neere the highest Scaffold, he sent one of the six Pages which followed him, to enquire where the King was; who haveing obey'd and satisfied his Lord, he himselfe immediatly advanc't towards Arsaces, and made him a salutation much after the rate of these ensuing words, Sir, (said he) I am of that Arabia which is called the Happy, and am in some degree ally'd to the King of that country, I Ador'd a beauty there, which had no defect but hir cruelty, and though that soone ended with her life, yet my passion insteed of dying with the object of it; did the contrary, for it increast to such a height, that it seemed all those flames with which shee set so many hearts on fier, flew into mine, as the seate of their greatest and perfect'st Empire; & though tyme be the common cure of most misfortunes, yet it prou'd the increase of mine, for the more I reflected on my losse, the greater I always found it, and at last the operation of so just a greife, reduc'd me to so deepe a melancholly, that my King came to visite me, & to cure my passion spoake so many impious things against the perfection that had created it, (which he injuriously said was equald by many) that not daring to expiate his offence, with his life, because of his Caracter; I publiquely vow'd never to continue in his Dominions, and that I would visite all the Courts of Asia, to justify that none but my own King durst say any beauty was comparable to that of the faire Mizalinza's: to effect this I instantly abandon'd the place of my birth, and publisht my designe, and the conditions of the combate, (if any were so vaine as to undertake it) which were, That whosoever should defend the object of his passion by equaling it to hir that created mine, in case I became victorious, he should give me the Picture of his Mistris, which I ever after carried with me, & hung up as a Trophye; These foure & twenty severall Beautyes had the ill fortune to be compar'd to Mizalinza's, and by the Death, or Conquest of those which ador'd them, are now to waite upon hir, whom their deluded Lovers equall'd them to. The fame of this great meeting, has drawn me Sir to your Court, where if any be so presumptuous as to justifie such a folly, I will not with my Lance alone (which I understand is the only armes of this Tilting) but with my Sword maintaine a truth which Mizalinza's eyes, more then the Defeate of the greatest courages in the world, hath abundantly justified. But perhaps (he continu'd) that the sight of this charming beauty, will produce a confession, which may exempt my sword from that trouble; Thereupon with a deepe reverence, he drew out the Coppy of so glorified an Originall, & haveing exposed it to all our views, he further added, that if any durst undertake to lessen hir perfection by a comparison, that the next morning he would appeare on the same place he was then on, to manifest to the offender, that nothing but his blood was capable to wash away his crime; Then without staying for any answer, hee retir'd to his lodgings, and left us in as great an astonishment at his insolence, as at his passion; But Arsaces, who was a Prince that in his youth had bin blest with a high vallour, did so exceedingly resent the impudence of Ambixules (for so this Arabian Prince was called) that he publikely profest, if none in his Court had the courage to fight with him, he would doe it, for the defence of an Immaginary Mistris rather than suffer an affront to be done unto the Parthians, as great, even as the insolency with which it was committed. There is no doubt but that Orodes Court, was then replennisht with men, who apprehended nothing in dangers, but that they were not great enough; Yet at that instant, the loves of the major parte were so unhappy, that they durst not acknowledge the objects of them, and 'twas upon that score only this Arabian had like to have engrost an honor without Drawinge his Sword, greater then ever he had obtaynde by it. The same misfortune had then an influence over me, and I dare truly professe, if I had any uncertaynty in the undertakeing to punish Ambyxules insolence, it proceeded, not from my Apprehension of him but Parthenissa, for whome I durst hardly acknowledge openly I had a passion, till shee in private had approu'd it; But yet I thought the crime of that presumption would not equall that of the tacite confession any beauty transcended hirs, & that I had a lesse Title to hir anger, by discovering my flame to defende hir right, than expose that to any apparent injury, by a concealement of it: Neither was it impossible but I might returne from the combate without receiving any such wounds, whose cure might necessitat my discovery, in which case I was resolu'd to conceale my selfe, & not acknowledge my passion, till shee to whom it was addrest would blesse me with the reception of it, 'Twas with these and many such reasons that I assumed a resolution to become the Protector of an excellency, which had no misfortune, but that it needed one, or that it had one so unworthy that honor as Artabbanes: I kept this determination exceeding private, least if it had bin discover'd my friends might have deny'd my first essay in Armes to have been against so knowne a Conqueror; I had some difficulty too, to fit my selfe with Armor, for that I had made use of the two precedent dayes, was too publiquely knowne to have been used the third: But, I remember'd that the Prince Sillaces, my most particular friend, and who merited abundantly to be so, had an excellent one, which hee had made for that solemnity, but being unfortunatly troubl'd with an Ague, he was necessitated to decline shewing his skill, and gallantry, which indeed I apprehended more than any others; These Armes I sent privatly to borrow of his servant, who knowing his Prince could not possibly use them, sent them to me, and I found that they were very fit, our shapes and heights being as resembling, as our friendships. I will not amuze my selfe to tell you how impatiently I past the night, nor how early I came to the Assignation lest some other should have prevented me; I shall only let you know, that I was there before any that might have had my designe, and before Ambyxules too, whom I did not long expect, and who at his entry into the lists, Mannadg'd his horse with so much Art and grace, that hee attracted all the eyes of the assistants: After hee had ended, I began the same exercise, to shew him I was not ignorant of it; But not to dresse a true story in the cloathes of a Romance, I will passe by the description of our Armes, Devices, Motto's, and all things of so low a nature, to acquaint you, that Ambixules having repayd me the civility of looking on his horse's Mannage, demanded of me the sight of my Mistris picture; to which I told him; That the excellency I Ador'd, would not be what it was, if it lay in the power of art to represent it, but that the Originall being present, I would conduct him to it, where his justice, must be as blinde, as She her selfe is painted, if he did not adore, what he came to injure; Come said Ambixules smiling I will goe see this beauty, to convince you by a demonstration, that he which hath seene Mizalinz's eyes can be conquer'd by no others; but (he continu'd,) though contrary to my practice I am content to begin the combate before I see your Mistris Picture, yet you must oblige your selfe, that some friend for you after your Death will let me have the reward of it. This insolence did not a little offend me, but being resolv'd to repaire the wrong with nobler Armes than those which had committed it, I only told him, I was confident to give him the recompence of the Victory, before he won it, since 'twas impossible to see Parthenissa, without carrying away hir Image. By this tyme wee were come so neere hir, that I went to the Scaffold shee was on, and without lifting up my Helmet (to continue my disguise) I saluted her with a respect equall to my passion, and told hir; Madam, if I have the confidence to begg your permission to vindicate your beauty, 'tis out of a certainty that the successe of so just a dispute, cannot but prove as fortunate, as that it needs not any defence; Neither doe I draw my sword to justify, that you are the perfectest of your Sexe, but to punish Ambixules for not acknowledging it. Whilst I was speaking these few words, she was in some disorder, yet it was so innocent a one, that it rather was a friend than enemy to her beauty, but shee quickly supprest it, to answer me. Whosoever you are, that to give a large proofe of your Courage, give as little a one of your judgement, I shall conjure you not to undertake a defence, where the injustice of the quarrell, may give your enemy an advantage, which I believe he would hardly obtaine on a contrary score. Madam I repli'd I know how to distinguish betwixt your Modesty and your Iustice, and consequently to attribute what you now speake, to the first; but if you have so partiall a character of the faire Parthenissa I will covince her by an experiment, how much she has injur'd herself & my election. Thereupon saluting her with an infinit humility, but without staying for any reply, I desir'd Ambixules to returne to the place of combate, and to hasten a decision of it; but he was so intent, and ravish't in the cosideration of Parthenissa's beauties, that to interrupt his thoughts I was forced to tell him; Ambixules, I feare if you continue longer in the imployment you are in, I shall have but little honor in my victory, haveing to deale with one who will have lost his heart. This Truth made him asham'd of what he should rather have gloried in, so that turning about his horse, he ridd with me where the Iudges attended us, and by the way assur'd me that my Mistris had so much of Mizalinza in her, that haveing vanquisht me, he would desire no other Picture of her, than that which he carryed in his memory. This Antedated Victory I excus'd upon the same score that I had the former, being by this time come where 'twas no more tyme to talke. I will passe by, acquainting you with the joy Arsaces had to perceive this Arabian was not altogether unlike to escape unpunished, the generall wonder of all the Court who I was, and the secret repining of many beautyes to perceive Parthenissa's could finde a Protector when none of theirs had any, to tell you, That the three first courses wee broake our lances with equall advantage, and perceiving they were too civill weapons for our designes, wee both, as if it had been by mutuall consent drew out our swords, and soone made each other feele what temper they were of; but Ambixules haveing given me a furious reverse, which I was endeavouring to repay in the same coyne, his horse unexpectedly rise before, so that what I intended for his Master, fell upon him, and the blow being given with all my strength, and lighting upon his head cleft it in two; I was extreamely troubled at this misfortune, and haveing begg'd Ambixules pardon for an undesign'd wrong, I trotted some twenty paces from him, and lighting off my horse I return'd againe and told him, that to manifest I would take no advantage over him, but what I had by the goodnesse of my quarrell, and that what I had done was unintended, I came to offer him, if hee thought hee had any odds in fighting on horse-back, to send for a fresh one, that then hee should make choice of that or of mine, or if hee esteem'd himselfe in as good a condition on foote, I was ready so to finish what we had begun. The Arabian repli'd, that hee knew his courage gave him sufficient advantage over me in whatsoever posture he was in, and since I had kill'd his horse, he would not so long a time suspend his Revenge, as that which must be spent in sending for another; This rudenesse so insenst me that I repaide it with some dangerous wound, but at the last, finding his fury more than his strength made him continue the combat, I retir'd two or three paces, with intention to preserve a valor I could not but esteeme, though I had receiv'd some dangerous effects of it, and told him. You see Ambixules the power of Iustice which has reduced you to a condition of acknowledgeing, rather then persevering in your error, and that advantage which the goodnesse of my cause has given me, I desire to employ onely to obtaine a confession from your tongue, which your weakenesse has already made. Nor my weaknesse, nor my tongue (said he) shall ever confesse you have any advantage over mee, and whilst I hold my Sword, you shall finde mee a subject fitter to create your Feare than your Pitty. Thereupon hee renew'd the fight with much more strength than I thought I had left him, yet for a while I onely defended my selfe, but when I perceiv'd his blowes were so briske, that my charity might prove my ruine, and that hee had so much vigour, as I might kill him without a staine, I cry'd out to him, since my civility cannot make you acknowledge what your justice should, your death shall. Finishing these words I made him soone feele the punishment of a fault which might have had a milder reparation, if the continuance of his insolence had not render'd him unworthy of it. But to conclude this Tragedy, as soone as he fell told me. Whosoever thou art, I forgive thee that death which by my being worsted is rather my joy than my trouble, and though I scorne to beg my Life, (were it in thy power to save, which I thanke the Gods it is not), yet I doe not, to conjure thee, to assure that Beauty which to have fought against does more afflict me than to be reduc'd to what I am, that 'twas her Eyes which inspir'd thy Arme and weigh'd downe mine, and, that had not shame been more prevalent with me than truth, I had been her Champion, and not her Adversary; Conjure her too, to pardon a Crime which I expiate with my blood, and which my hand should have punisht for her, if thine had not. Hee would have continu'd this recantation by which I perceiv'd I had not only kill'd an enemy but a Rivall, had he not found, that his tongue began to faulter, which made him, though with much difficulty turne himselfe towards the place where Parthenissa was, and not haveing the strength to speake to her, hee lift up his hands to implore that pardon his hasty summons hinder'd him to expresse. As soone as Ambixules was dead, all his Pages came and presented me those Pictures which had been the Rewards of their Princes former Combats, and desir'd mee that they might have his Body to carry into Arabia, which I yeelded unto, and then taking all the consequents of my Victory, I went with them to Parthenissa's Scaffold, where I found her by an excesse of goodnesse weeping the death of her Enemy, which made mee envy what I had deplor'd, and forc't me to thinke my successe a misfortune, since it created the faire Parthenissa's Teares, who judging of my disorder by my silence, wipte them away, and thereby gave mee the confidence to present her with all those faire Captives, and to tell her, That the Originalls of them could no more complaine against their Servants unhappy defence, since thereby they had the honor to be Hers, which was a felicity greater than any could have attended their successe. I then acquainted her with Ambixules last injunction, which I said was a proofe that not onely Hee, but his Reason was vanquisht, and that if hee had earlier confest a truth which he could not but be convinc't of, I would rather have elected to employ my sword against my selfe, than him, so great and just was the respect I pay'd all her Adorers, under which title I implor'd a pardon for haveing brought that to a dispute which needed none, and that Her Iustice would acknowledge, what that of the Gods had, by the event of our Combate. To which Parthenissa reply'de: I am convinc't of nothing by your Victory, but of your Civility and Courage, the last of which you were certainly very confident of, when you durst undertake to employ it in so unjust a quarrell; neither can I doubt but by your electing mee for the subject of your difference, you had an intention to manifest, that your Sword needed no other assistance, but what it receiv'd from your Arme, and the concealing of your self after a performance, which the severest modesty might glory in, confirmes mee that you injure your Courage to avoyd doeing the like unto your Iudgement, and finde more shame in owning the object of your Quarrell, than satisfaction in the effect it has produc't. Ah Madam I replyde, doe not impute the concealing my selfe to any thing but the respect I pay you, which is so great and just, that I had rather decline what you are pleas'd to say I may glory in, than hazard your anger by disclosing who I am, the apprehension of the latter, being farre more prevalent with mee, than any advantage I can derive from the former. But after some discourses of this quality, observing that not only all the Court, but Arsaces himselfe was coming towards Parthenissas Scafford, I thought it high time to retire, and therefore made hast to tell her, that I was resolv'd to a concealement of my name, till by a succession of services, I induced her to pardon the scoare upon which they were perform'd. A little Blush which this declaration caused, gave mee a beliefe that shee understood my meaning, and the apprehension I had of her reply, as well as of being inviron'd by the crow'd, made me take my leave, but on an instant I found a certaine coldnesse like the hand of Death seize on me, and suddenly after I fell pale and speechlesse at Parthenissa's Feete. This unexpected accident had a very powerfull influence on her whilst she knew me not, but after she had discover'd who I was by some peoples pulling off my helmet to give me a little aire, she abandon'd herselfe to such excesse of griefe, that many attributed the effects of her good nature to a more obliging cause, and doubtlesse had I seene how happy I was in my misfortune, I had blest those wounds which were the causes of it. In briefe, as soone as those which stood by knew me, they cry'd out, Artabbanes is dead, which repeated noyse comeing at last to Moneses and Lindadory's heareing, they ran transported with admiration and griefe to the place where I lay, & where they found Parthenissa with one hand stopping a spring of blood which issued from a large wound Ambixules had given me, and with the other endeavouring to wipe away two springs of teares which ran from her faire Eyes. That charity gave them as high a subject of acknowledgement, as the occasion of it did of griefe; But at last a Litter being brought, and my blood stanch't, I was carryed to Moneses Pallace accompanyed by the Teares of those, whose Acclamations I so lately had. Arsaces did mee the honor to walke a foote by my Litter, and to see the first dressing of my wounds, where hee receiv'd an assurance from the Chyurgions, that I had none which were dangerous, that the losse of blood was the greatest harme I had sustained, and that rest was one of the best remedies they could prescribe; Wherefore my Chamber was immediately emptied of all but my faithfull Symander; But this deepe silence was so farre from producing the effect which those that enjon'd it expected, that it did a contrary one, for then all my thoughts began to assault me. What? said I to my selfe, can Parthenissa have a greater assurance of the vastnes of my passion than Her knowledge of those Beauties which created it, and the services I have this day render'd them? Shee were as unjust as shee is Faire, should shee desire any stronger proofe of my Affection? But suddenly my opinion changing, mee thought I heard Parthenissa say: Presumptuous Artabbanes, dost thou esteeme me at so lowe a rate as to thinke that, that nothing whith thou hast done to day deserves me? Thou hast lov'd me because I was lovely, the greatnes of thy passion renders thy service the lesse, & thou hast more injur'd me by thinking my beauty needed that defence, than obliged me, by assuming it. This reproofe which my distemper made me fancy came from the Oracle of my Fate had so powerfull an operation, that I cryed out, Yes Madam, I acknowledge your reprehension to be as just as my presumption is great, & I am now so sensible of my Crime, that if you do not speedily pardon it, I will revenge you upon the miserable Artabbanes, 'tis but letting these wounds weepe blood untill their source be dry, so Death more pittifull than you, will make my punishment the way unto my quiet. These words spoake in a high tone, made Symander almost as frantick as my Distempers had me, for being ignorant of the cause, hee concluded the height of my Feaver made mee rave, and fearing lest I should put my words in practice, he ran to the Bedds side, and flinging open the Courtens, besought mee in teares, not to make my selfe the meanes to increase a danger, which of it selfe was but too desperat: This action of his put mee out of that deepe melancholly my Love and disorder had lead me into, and turning from him with a great sigh, I replyde. Alas Symander, thou wouldst indeed thinke my condition desperat if I assur'd thee my wounds are the least torment that I suffer. Sir said the faithfull Servant, if I thought so, let your torment be never so high mine would be equall to it. I will then conceale it from thee I replyde, for I love thee too well to load thee with an unnecessary griefe, the weight whereof is such, that I should thinke it a Cryme to wish it on my greatest Enemy. Ah Sir (he answer'd) give not my affection for you so ill a returne as to make it render me uncapable of serving you: it may be when I know the cause of your griefe, I may finde out a remedy, at least an ease for it, my riper yeares may know what yours have not yet attain'd unto, and if the sacrificeing of so poore a thing as my Life can any way contribute to your quiet, I shall thinke it gloriously bestow'd. His discretion, and fidelity, made mee disclose my passion, having first confin'd him to an inviolable secrecy by all those protestations which might most possitively doe it: As soone as I had acquainted him with this Secret, I perceiv'd a visible alteration in his Countenance, as if the knowledge of the Disease gave him an assurance of the Cure; And that his words might doe what his looks had, he immediatly told me; If your recovery Sir of the wound you receiv'd from Ambixules, were as certaine as of that Love has given you, my joy would be then as great, as now my apprehension is: for, I am confident your Vertue, and Merit, will obtaine her Affection, or your Iudgement, and Resentment will prove your Cure. Dost thou thinke said I my passion has already so dethron'd my Reason as to credit what without any thou assurest me of? but allow I were blest with perfections as great as thou canst fancy, yet compar'd to hers, they would only serve but as their foyle, and consequently the more her Perfections are disclos'd, the more it would bring an accession to my now Cause of adoring them, were that capable of any: Other Lovers may hope by a resemblance in merit, to create one in love, but the object of mine is so peculiar in her Prerogative, that what others derive from Sympathy, I must from Mercy: and to expect, my Iudgement should recover me, were the same as to expect what gives the wound should cure it too, since Iudgement acts in me, what Fancy doth in others, and findes more reason for my slavery, than I can finde to decline it: to hope too for liberty by resentment, were a folly only fit for her pitty, the Mariner that is going to be Shipwrack't, may as justly hope by quarrelling with the Windes to free himselfe, as I by electing the same course, may expect a resembling event: Alas her Eyes are my destinie, and 'tis not my Will, but They that governe me, yet were I at my owne dispose, I would not alter my condition, for the contemplation of her Beauty though shee prove cruell, is a more Transcendent felicity than others derive from fruition; so that thy advice must not be how to flye, but how to Conquer. To which he answer'd, Is there than no Meane to be expected in your Fortune? None (said I) 'twere in vaine for to perswade me otherwise. Then Sir (he reply'd) you take away which looks, as if you shun'd your end, for can you thinke while you contribute to your sicknesse you advance your Love? No, but the contrary, for this disorder not only deprives you of your good Meene but of time to court the faire Parthenissa in, and if you have Rivalls (as sure such Beauty cannot but create you some) what happy opportunity do you present them: Besides if you are so negligent of your health, the want of that, will make you uncapable of what you neede not apprehend on any other score, Ah Symander (I cry'd out) thou speakest of a felicity fitter for my desires than expectation, but why dost thou flatter my hopes with Ioyes that will ever be notionall, and dost like Dreames which making me beleeve an ayery happynes, pleasest me for a moment, but when I wake againe, I pay with reall Torments an Imaginary Heaven, Truly Sir (reply'd Symander) I have alwayes esteem'd Dispaire as great a Crime as Presumption, and must therefore begg you, as Parthenissa's perfections keepes you from being guilty of the last of these, so let your owne secure you from the first. After he had spoaken this he was silent a while, and then he thus proceeded. I have Sir alwayes observ'd that interressed partyes, what ever the busines is, are the unfittest to conclude it, especially in affaires of Love, where Modesty has so much dominion, and therefore if a third person were employ'd, whose secrecy and Iudgement were equally unquestionable, I thinke it would much contribute to your designe, especially if it were one of the same Sexe, and therefore (Sir) your Sister the Princesse Lindadory, if she could be engaged, 'twould turne my hopes of your successe into a certainty, the opportunities shee may obtaine may be deny'd to you, and she may suddenly procure from Parthenissa a Declaration, which nothing but sufferings and time can obtaine by you. This advice I so well approved of, that I comanded him immediatly to put it in practice, and though he perswaded mee by many motives to deferre it till the morning, yet my impatience was more prevalent with him, than his reasons were with me. As soone as he had brought Lindadory to me, and that she was set on the Bed-side, I tooke her by the hand, and haveing prest it betweene mine, I looked upon her stedfastly, and with a deepe sigh ask'd her. Doe you love me Sister? Is the poore Artabbanes life of any concernement to you? To which she answer'd, If I thought Brother you askt this Question as doubting it, my trouble would be as great as my affection: Deere Sister (I replyde) this proceeds not from my doubte, but to heare my joy repeated, for the state I am now in is so sadd, that I am forc't to summon all my felicities to keepe mee from dispaire, the cause of it is, that I am in Love, and the object of mine is Parthenissa, who to see, and not to have a passion for, were as high a miracle as is her Beauty; and though shee should prove cruell, yet her hatred could not be a Torment greater than my Folly, should I for that decline adoreing her. Thus you see cleerely your Artabbanes condition, and now do not so much wrong it, as to thinke I make it worse than 'tis, for if I could, it would not be so great a torment. I will not so much abuse your patience (said Artabbanes to Callimmachus) as to relate every particuler circumstance of this Story, it shall suffice I tell you, Lindadory who lov'd me perfectly, & knew my disposition so, did not oppose that which was my desire, especially being grounded, as shee confest, on so much reason and justice; and therefore wee then resolv'd that she should be my Agent, and Confident, and that the next day shee should visit Parthenissa (as sometimes shee us'd to doe) and carry a letter to her which I then writ, but with much difficulty, both in respect of the paine my wounds gave me, & in procuring Lyndadorys, and Symanders permission, who were apprehensive that sitting up (tho in my Bed) would prove prejudiciall to me, but having vowed to them not to do it, would prove much more so, I had the liberty to write these words,  Passion, which offend's the faire Parthenissa, I am ready to shed the residue of it to appease her; but before I obey a sentence I cannot more apprehend, than I will readily execute, I must begg her to believe that the wounds I have receiv'd From her Beauty, are farre more dangerous than those I have receiv'd For it; 'Tis Madam at the last extremity, that I make my Pen assure you of a Truth which my fainting forc't me to disclose, and which I confesse, should rather be employ'd to implore your Pardon, than repeate my Crime, but I am necessitated to extreames, and by so resolute a confession induce you to pardon a Passion whose greatnesse you cannot doubt since I cannot conceale it: or else condemne the Possessor of it: If you chuse to put your Iustice in practice, I am resolv'd to become its Executioner by declining a Recovery of these wounds Ambixules has given me, that the world may believe I dy'de For the faire Parthenissa, and not By her, But if she elect to make use of her Mercy; shee will preserve a Flame which has no fault, but the ambition of aspiring so high.  The successe which my Sister assur'd me of, whether to create my beliefe, or to acquaint mee with hers, made mee after her departure take some rest, though mine was often interrupted through different Dreames; but no sooner the day appear'd which I did so long for, than I did as much so, that it had been ended. I could never imagine till then, that Impatience was so great a deluder, for mine forc'd mee to thinke it the longest day that ever I had seene, though it were but the first of the Spring: but the occasion which made it seeme so tedious, was, that at Night Lindadory had promis'd to bring me my diffinitive sentence. At last the so much desired houre arriv'd, and immediatly after, my Sister, who was no sooner come into my Chamber, than I endeavour'd to learne in her Countenance her Successe: But Sillaces who could not contribute to his health, by not seeing the condition of mine, came then to give me a visit, whose company before, was ever as pleasing, as at that instant it was the contrary: Love having so much of meanenesse in it as to make us preferre our owne interest, before our friends. But least the impatience I was then in, should yet seeme to transporte me, I must tell you something of the Generous Sillaces, who has been so great an Actor in the ensueing Story: Hee is Prince of Tabiena, and of an Extraction as famous for Antiquity as Vertue, If Fortune had been as prodigall towards him as Nature, hee had long since been Possessor of Landadory, and enjoyed a perfect happinesse; But his chiefest Riches consisting in that which the Old thinke to be onely the Ornament, though it be in effect the Essentiall parte of men, and my Father who esteemed a vertuous person without Riches, fitter for his Acquaintance than Alliance, deny'd Sillaces my Sister. His passion for Lindadory was till then unknown to me, and that which gave me the first suspition of it, was, the alteration I perceiv'd in both their Countenances that Night, when hee so unhappily came in to disturbe us. I believe hee easily found by our silence, that his company was not so pleasing as it us'd to be, which he since told me he attributed to some light I had discover'd of his Passion, not that he fear'd I would oppose it, but that I was offended to learne it from any but himselfe. As soone as he had taken up this opinion, he concluded himselfe fit company for nothing but his Thoughts, and therefore immediatly withdrew to entertaine them, leaving me at liberty to doe the same with Lindadory: To whom I abruptly said with all the impatiencies of Love, Feare,  & Hope, Deere Sister, what must your Artabbanes expect? have you receiv'd any returne, which may build my hope on Iustice? If you have not, I should be as cruell to my selfe as Parthenissa is to me, if I endeavour'd to preserve a Life she is so intent to destroy: but if you bring me comfort, you will raise joy unto a height it never untill now attain'd unto. Brother, shee replide, I finde by my waiting on Parthenissa, that her reserv'dnesse is proportionate to all her other perfections, and consequently the procuring so much as I have done, assures me, if all your Felicity consists in the obtayning her Favour, you are not far from your desirs. This I speak to stay your longing, for now I must tell you, I never (till your interest ingadg'd mee) so narrowly observ'd your Mistris: but in this short while I have discover'd so many fresh Graces in her, and those shine so cleerely, that not onely I doe extoll your choyce, but wish my Sexe were chang'd, that I might be your Rivall: For the beauty of her Minde equalls, if not transcends that of her Body, and what my complyance yesterday approv'd in you, this day my Reason does. Deere Sister (said I interrupting her) though I am ravisht with this description of Parthenissa, how imperfect soever it be; yet I must deprive my selfe a while of the lesser happinesse, and begg to learne the Greater, which is, to know, if for this pleasing joy you put me in, I am not more indebted to your kindnesse than hers? this you must tell mee truly, for you cannot long deceive mee, and if I once finde you doe; by all that's holy, I'le take so severe a revenge upon my selfe, you cannot but repent you were the cause of it, for deprivation of hope is the highest misery but deprivation of possession: Therfore deere Lindadory, I conjure you by our Affections, tell me really what interrest I have in the Felicity before you tell me what the Felicity is, for if I have none, the knowledge how great the Blessing is, will but proportionatly increase the Torment of being denide it, and if I have any, you are too cruell thus long to keepe me in suspence. My indiscretion (said she) would equall your impatience should I prayse a happinesse you so justly ambition if I knew you should ne're possesse it, but since you enjoyne me so powerfully to tell you what I have done, you shall first learne, I have acquainted Parthenissa that you Love her, but with a Passion as farre above all others, as the beauty is which creates it; And to confirme her in that beliefe, I presented her with your letter which she made some scruples to receive, but my importunities so supprest them, that at last shee read it, and then told me. I have so little Title both to the Perfections and the Power your Brother ascribes unto mee, that I receive them rather for Civilities than Truths. O Gods! (I cryed out interrupting her) can shee be ignorant, of that which is so visible? or Can so high a vertue be capable of as high a dissimulation? Brother (said Lindadory) your Impatience makes you practice in your selfe what you but now condemn'd in mee: Can you blame (I repli'd) so necessary an interruption? shall Modesty be esteem'd a greater vertue than Iustice? or are they inconsistent together? But I beseech you proceed, and grant mee now your pardon, for which, I will engage my selfe not a second time to need it. I had no small trouble, said Lindadory, to make her confesse shee believ'd your affection was such as you describ'd it, but the labour was farre more difficult to procure from her any thing to you, that might give you that assurance. But (shee continu'd) to obey your Injunction, I will not give you all the particulers by retayle, knowing that to relate the meanes, is onely pleasing but as it conduces to the end, which is, that I have brought you a letter from Parthenissa. Ah Sister! (said I starting up): how many obligations have you contracted in this one? then calling for a Lampe after haveing a thousand times kist & Idollatriz'd the faire Characters, I read these ensueing words.  that which was an offence, you have discoverd too, that which is partly the reparation: since what acquainted me with the Fault, acquainted me with the Punishment of it: and if I have now any Resentments they will sooner be satisfied by your preserveing, than by your shedding that which is left.  Alas (said I, haveing ended reading) I may with much greater justice say of this Letter, that it has more of Civility than Affection, than shee of mine, that it had more of Civility than Truth. Then letting my selfe fall into my Bedd againe, I continued. Vnfortunate Artabbanes, thou art yet as miserable as ever: for here is not enough Kindnes to make thee live, nor Cruelty to make thee dye: I now perceive there may be Cruelty in not being Cruell enough, that a little Kindnesse may be a great Cruelty, and that suspension may be so order'd, that it may prove as great a misery as deprivation. If your Complaint were just (said Lindadory) I should be so farre from condemning, that I should participate with you in it: Take heed Artabbanes lest you offend the Gods,  & that by not valuing this high favour, you thereby provoke them to recall it, If every day you make an equall progresse to this, beleeve me, the wound of your Minde will be sooner cur'd than that of your Body, Remember, if shee were as soone obtain'd as askt, that might in the future trouble you as much, as the feare of the contrary does at the present: since 'tis in Love, as in Warr, where the greater the difficulty is in the Succes, the greater is both the Satisfaction & Glory of it. If (said I) Parthenissa's Perfections needed a Foyle to set them off, there might be Some reason in what you think, has so much, But in the possession of Parthenissa, all Ioyes are included, and not One without it, so that nothing but the end here can be term'd Felicity. I must confesse, that in meaner Affections so much Nourishment as this, would preserve Hope from Death, but where the cause of the Love, and the Love it selfe, is so Infinite, if all things else be not resemblnge, my sufferings must: The wanting of never so little lesse than what will of necessity suffice, is as bad as if all were wanting: as well in the Food of the Minde as on the Body: therefore to be kinde, and not kinde enough, does too deservedly loose that Name, and Operation; You must not therefore measure my condition at the same rate with other Lovers, but proportionatly to the Beauty I adore, and then you will conclude as right, as now you doe the contrary. All the arguments Lindadory could use, were not of sufficient force to moderate my Despaire, me thought Parthenissa's Letter had so much of Indifferency in it, that I could not have too-much of Sorrow for it, and that which prov'd no small accession to mine, was my Sisters confession how difficult it was to obtaine so little, which too I receiv'd rather from her Importunity, than Parthenissa's Favour. These and many such reasons, which my dispaire furnisht me withall, created in me a Beliefe, that it were to be cruell to my selfe not to dye of those Wounds, which were such, that they made the way to Death farre easier than to Recovery, and consequently it had been a weakenesse equall to the punishment would have attended it, if when the meanes to end all miseries was easy, and the way to begin miseries was as difficult as to persevere in them, I should have declin'd the first to embrace the last; in which Resolve my Body so well seconded my Minde, that my Feaver so increast all that Night as the next Day when my Sister came to visit me, I was so neere loosing my Life that it had almost cost her her Owne, for shee fell into divers fitts of swonding, & the last was of so long a duration that Symander who stood by imagin'd shee had lead me the way to death, but when shee was recover'd from her seeming one, shee begg'd me with a Throng of Sighs and Tears, not to cast my selfe away, out of an imagination I was miserable when really I was otherwise, which if I would give her a little time to evince, I should be assur'd it from Parthenissa: Ah Sister (I replyde) if you could performe what you say; my Recovery would be as certain & speedy, as my Death will be without it. Deere Brother (said Lindadory) give me but one dayes respit, and if I doe not satisfy my Engagement inflict on me what Punishment you please, and I will willingly endure it. All the penance (I replide,) which I will impose on you, if you prevayle not is, that you will give me leave to dye, for then you cannot more oppose my doeing so than my condition will require it. While we were in this discourse, one of my Sisters servants came and acquainted her, that Parthenissa was come to give her a visit: Lindadory turning towards mee, told me softly, receive this as an Earnest from the Gods of their future blessing who have doubtlesse sent her hither purposely to contract the time of your suspension: Immediatly after she went to her Chamber where Parthenissa was, who perceiveing by my Sisters Eyes, as well as Countenance, that some Grief sat upon her Heart, shee told her. Madam, the place from whence you now came, and the effect of some great Sorrow which is too-visible in your Face, makes me apprehend something of danger in your Brother. Would it might please the Gods (replide Lindadory) that you would as soone apply the Remedy to my Grief, as you have found, out the Occasion of it, which if your Will be but resembling to your Power, you may performe as easily as desire, for my Brothers danger is the cause of that effect you seeme somewhat concern'd in, for though those wounds Ambixules gave him are very dangerous, yet those you have given him are much more so, & creates His and My greatest apprehension, therefore Madam, consider the ruinous estate he's in without the Felicity of your Favor, and receive this as a certaine Truth, that unlesse you assure him of it now, it will be too late to doe it hereafter: give I beseech you to my Prayers and his Condition, what I am confident you would hereafter to his Services if he could live to pay you them, and then Gratitude will act in him what Hope would. Lindadory's Reason and the sad extremity I was in, furnisht her with so many Arguments, both to move Parthenissa's Iudgement and Pitty, that at last with much difficulty shee acknowledg'd never to have had a higher Esteeme for any than for Me, and her inclinations were of such a quallity that by my Services, and Fidelity I might in time procure no unfruitfull returne of them. This Declaration was as pleasing to Lindadory as my Recovery, for indeed it was in effect the same thing; shee begg'd her therefore to give me a visit, and assure mee of what shee had then said. Parthenissa would have left that employment to Lindadary, but shee excus'd her selfe, by alledging it wonld be too-good Newes to be credited from any but her Selfe, adding further that shee might performe a visit of that high concernment, with so much secrecy, that none could ever discover it, there being a Back-stayres which went out of her Chamber into Mine, where no Company then was (least it might interrupt my rest) and I am the more pressing in it (continu'd Lindadory) not only as it will be the efficient cause of his preservation, but that seeing him in the forelorne condition he is in, you may never hereafter quarrell with your Modesty for condescending to that now, which if any longer delay'd would prove ineffectuall; Then without so much as seeming to suspect a refusall, shee tooke her by the Hand, and haveing lead her into my Chamber, shee open'd the Courten and told me, Brother, I here present you with the rarest Physician in all Asia, whose Skill I believe your very Sight will convince you of; I could not fancy that this rare Physician was Parthenissa, and knowing all others disability in my Sicknesse, I did not so much as turne my Eyes that way, but being somewhat offended, that She who knew so well the nature of my Disease, should be so mistaken in the means of my Cure, I reply'd: Sister I perceive, that Parthenissa has rejected your Prayers, and that you have as a last Essay brought this Physician to practice on mee as on a lost Patient, but 'tis in vaine, I that feele the Power of her Beauty will never so much wrong the Effects of it, as to believe any can cure my wounds but She that made them: let mee therefore desire you to implore this last Favour from her, that before I dye, shee would looke upon the miserable Artabbanes, and give me leave to see once againe that Beauty, the cruell (but faire) Cause of my Martyrdome, which I have so much reason to hate, and yet have more not to doe it, that shee may heare how zealously I'le pray for the preservation of my Murderer, and that shee may live in Ioyes as Great as she has the Power to confer on me. These sad words, had a powerfull influence on Lindadory, who fancying it a Sinne to jest so cruelly, begg'd me to turne about with such earnestnesse, that at last I did: but great Gods! how was I surpriz'd? My Amazement was such, that Ioy had like to have perform'd what Griefe had but begun. Lindadory's Raillery, and this Surprize was of very much use to Parthenissa, who was so confus'd when she consider'd the action shee had undertaken, that though the time of her silence was long, yet (as she told me often since) shee was as long before shee was able to speak to me, but perceiveing I was at least in an equall perplexity; that did somwhat assure her, and then approaching to my Bedds- side, shee told mee, I am come to know (Artabbanes) whether the Power you said I had over you was a Civility or a Truth? but I too visibly perceive it is onely the first, or else your Recovery before now had assured mee the contrary. Ah Madam (said I) reproach mee not the Crime you your Selfe make mee commit, for, 'twas not your Commands alone could make mee live, but something added to them, which I thought fitter, and easier for you to imagine than I to name: but your not taking notice of it, alas did it too-too much, and being depriv'd of my Hopes, I resolv'd under an appearance of Cruelty to be mercifull unto my selfe, and by yeelding to One Death to free my selfe from a Thousand: neither Madam, can I think you will be offended at that Election, since by disobeying of you once, I render my selfe for ever uncapable of doing so againe, but by my Obedience, either your Cruelty must have been as great as your Beauty, or my Sufferings would have farre more troubl'd you, than this one breach of your Commands. I perceive (reply'd Parthenissa) that you counterfeit an Ignorance, only to extort a Knowledge, which is fitter for my Blushes to assure you than my Words, but to evidence how great a Power the Princesse Lindadory has over me, I doe not onely command you to live, but shall judge of your Passion by your Obedience, and reward it so too. Alas Madam (I replyde) must I then derive my Felicity from a Third person? and must the Means, lessen the End? To which Parthenissa presently answer'd, your scruples are much greater then their cause which intirely to remoove I conjure you endeavour your Recovery, which effected, I am confident I shall soone give That to your Merit which I now say I doe to your Sisters Commands. If (I repli'd) I must expect that Blessing by that Title only, from this moment I renounce all hope of it, and therefore if you are not resolv'd of your selfe to conferre it on me, I beseech you let mee dye, otherwise you may be cruell in thinking not to be so. Madam (said Lindadory) I begg you to receive these importunate effects as coming from a noble cause, a Love so perfect; that nothing but a retribution which is so, can confer on it any quiet: and since you have thus farre proceeded, let not Words divert you when the Action does not, but by assureing him you will be favourable, preserve a life which I dare justify is wholly yours, and as wholly depends upon what you shall now speake. I know not (repli'd Parthenissa, pulling downe her Vayle to conceale her Blushes) what to say, but if what I have already spoaken doe not satisfy, what you are pleas'd to undertake I will confirme. Divine Parthenissa (said I, printing my burning Lipps upon her Hand) I desire no more, and may Torments equall to your Hate (if such could be found out) fall on me, if ever Passion was so pure as mine, or shall prove so constant. After a Thousand assurances of my Ioy, and Fidelity, wee heard Moneses knock at the doore, which occasion'd Parthenissa and Lindadory to retire softly the same way they came, for we thought it not fit hee should then know any thing of our Affaires. As soone as they were gone, he came in, and having enquired of my Health (which he found to be somewhat better'd) he went away againe. In briefe, my speedy recovery being enjoyn'd me as an evincement of the greatnesse of my Flame, I was so willing to embrace any thing might advance it, that in a short time my Wounds were fully heal'd, and then every day I gave the faire Parthenissa so many new confirmations of my Passion, that at last shee assur'd me of Hers. I can truly affirme, never two Hearts were more perfectly united than Ours: and if at any time so many perfections made my Desirs rebell against my Reason, shee immediatly supprest them with Reason: which was not only an argument of the vastnesse of her Wit, but of the proportionate Power shee had over me. But why doe I name the Felicities wee possest in those glorious dayes, when they were so short; that the time I have been telling you of them, seemes to me, to be longer than they themselves were, and when they doe but serve to add unto Miseries, which are but too great already, and are any other way uncapable of accession. Fortune which has been alwayes ingenuous to persecute mee, no sooner acquainted mee with the Blessing of Parthenissa's Conversation than shee sever'd mee from it: For there happened a difference betwixt Arsaces, and Artabazus the King of Armenia, concerning the Bounds of their Kingdomes, and as it is ordinary amongst Monarch's which are above the Lawes, to have immediate recourse to their Swords, and make them both plead and determine their dispute, so did they, and by it engag'd all the Gallantry of both their Kingdomes. I was ambitious to doe something that might give me an Interest in Parthenissa by my Actions, and therefore resolved to undertake the voyage, I waited on her to acquaint her with my designe, and found her alone in her Cabinet (as shee confest to mee afterwards) preparing Arguments to divert me from that Warr, which shee apprehended my Honor would engage me in, But I interrupted her thoughts by telling her, Madam, the joy of your Affection makes these Warres (the way to Glory) troublesome, for Love delights in none but what it selfe creates. Truely Artabbanes (she said) you can shew me no greater, nor pleasanter effects of your Flame than in observing what you now speak, since in this one Action wee give and receive assurances of each others Passion, for I have sufficient proofes of yours, when your Honor cannot vanquish your Love, and when you care not to satisfie the World so I be pleas'd: And you of Mine, when the highest condition (that of your Glory) cannot be of sufficient force to make your absence tollerable. Alas Madam (I replyde) how miserable am I then? that must plead against your Commands, and make use of Arguments, which if they prevaile, bannish me from my Felicity, and if they doe not, make me unworthy of it: but since inevitably I must fall into one of these Misfortunes, I had rather embrace the first, which though it make me perfectly wretched; yet 'twill extenuate your Choyce unto the world by evincing that the Man you elected to honor with your Affection, valued not the hazarding of his Life to merit it, and since to the further manifestation of that truth he dare expose himselfe to the Miseries of Absence, who can suspect hee will decline any other Proofe of it. I now perceive (said shee) Artabbanes, that you onely hitherto pretended a perfect Love, for one that is so, confines it selfe to the Object loved, and makes the satisfying of it, it's onely end: Alas, had I stood upon these Nicities, and not more consider'd You than the World, you had never taken my Heart by Assault, but by Seidge. To which I reply'd: 'Tis not onely Madam to please the World, but to establish my Felicity in the future, for this warre will every day create new occasions for my Rivalls to purchase Glory, and knowing your Iustice to be equall to your other Perfections, I would not by my Idlenesse provoke yours so much to make mee miserable, But then it may be you will answer, your Inclination leades you to honour mee with your Esteeme more than any other; but I beseech you Madam, consider how weake a Title that will appeere, when manifested Vertue shall come in competition with it? No, Faire Parthenissa, give me leave to act upon this Stage, where I will doe such Things, that if Merit could claime an Interest in you, you should be Mine by Right, and I will no longer owne the great Opinion you have of me to your Goodnesse but your Iustice. Cruell Artabbanes (said Parthenissa) have all the Vowes of Love, wrought so little on your Beliefe, as to thinke it's possible I can be any Mans but Yours? And that which you even now stil'd Iustice in Mee, would be Inconstancy and Perjury: besides, these high Things which you propound unto your selfe, cannot be attain'd without resembling Dangers, and should you miscarry in them (as the events of Warre are blind and uncertaine) how miserable would my Condition be? when the universall knowledge of your Vertue will so drowne all men in Griefe; that those which should afford mee any Consolation, will need it themselves: and every man will be a fresh Object to renew my Sorrow: Besides, what you would so hazardously court and solicit, is of so speculative and ayery a quality, that neither the simplest nor the wisest Souldier in the Army would now exchange Conditions with the Famous Alexander, the great Ingrosser of it. That, Madam I reply'd, would rather evince a want of Vertue in the Living than the Dead: so perhaps many Women now would not change condition with the excellent Lucretia, and yet that does not prove but hers is more to be ambition'd. To contract my Relation, I made use of so many Arguments, that at last shee resign'd the Field, but I perceiv'd it was with much reluctancy, for shee said, How just a cause have I to complaine, that either my affection is not lesse, which might render your departure supportable, or that being so Great, I cannot have proportion are Arguments to divert your Designe, But beleive me, though my Iudgement be convinc'd it is fit for you to undertake; yet my Love will never be so. Ah Madam (said I) how kinde, and how cruell are those words, for your Love transcending your Iudgment; how Vast an evincement is that of its being so, & on the other side, how cruell is the purchase of that Felicity by rendring your Love (the greatest of my Blessinges) now, the greatest of my Troubles. After I had done speakeing, shee lean'd her Cheeke upon her hand, and having thought a while shee look't on me stedfastly, with Teares running from her faire Eyes, and told me with a languishing Voyce, Artabbanes, since you are resolv'd to goe, I conjure you by your Passion, remember that we have exchang'd our hearts, and that loveing Parthenissa as you say more than your selfe; evince it by haveing more care of her Heart than if it were your Owne. And since you will allow nothing to surpasse your Affection; yet at least allow Mine to be equall to it, and then consider those Torments my Death would be to you, and be not too-prodigall of that Life, which if lost; must involve me in resembling ones. These words and Teares were so moveing, that I held it rather a Duty than a VVeaknesse to accompany her in the latter, which shee perceiving, began to aske me forgivenesse for having made me erre by her Example, and then went to a little Cabinet in her Closet, where shee tooke out her Picture which she presented mee, and I vow'd to weare, as long as that other I could not but carry about me whilst I did my Heart. If you have ever resented the pleasing flame of Love; you may then partly guesse how cruell this Separation was, otherwise, your Imagination will be as farre short of apprehending as I am of expressing it. But this being nothing essentiall to our Story, I will passe it over by telling you, that Pacorus, eldest Sonn to the King, was Generall of the Army, but my Father had the Superintendency of all: his deepe experience giveing him that Honor with as little Dispute as Envy. The Prince was accompany'd by his Brother Phraates, and all the other Great Men of the Empire, amongst whom Surena was the Chiefest, either for Person, Wit, Estate or Power, but of an Humor so uncontrolable that it clouded all his other Vertues. These Troopes were generally the Gallantest and best fitted of any I ever yet beheld, and in my Opinion the Roman Legions were as farre short of Them as they excell all others. After the Army was in a mooving Posture, Moneses lead the Body of it by easy marches towards Miramnes, a strong Town, which the Armenians had newly besieg'd with 50000. Foote and 10000. Horse, the King being there in person. Pacorus remain'd at Court ten dayes after, to receive his Instructions, and, by that time Moneses was within three dayes martch of the Enemy, the Prince and all his Court overtooke him, where a Messenger from the Governor of Miramnes, assur'd Pacorus, that if in three weeks hee had no Reliefe, it would be too-late to send him any. The next morning therefore hee tooke a view of his whole Army, which consisted of neere 40000. Foote and 15000. Horse, but so much of Resolution appear'd in the Officers and Souldiers Lookes; that hee thought every Houre of Delay so much time stolne from the Glory of his Triumph. The consequence of this Place was such, that immediatly a Councel of Warre was summon'd, where after a long Debate the Result of it was, That the Prince sent a Herauld with a Letter to the King of Armenia, to invite him on the large and adjoyning Playnes of Arontes, to decide their difference by a Battell, which would end the Warre and the Miseries that inevitably would be a Consequence of it. Artabbazus having consulted with the Chiefe Officers of his Army return'd this Answer.  Battell, moves me to accept it, and since the Gods are our Iudges, wee neede not feare Partiallity, the justest Sword wilbe the sharpest, and therefore the Conquerd shalbe esteemed Guilty, by ARTABAZVS.  This Answer was no sooner read, but orders were given to every Chiefe Officer to repaire to his Charge, and to exhort the Souldiers to performe their Dutyes with Curage and Vigilancy. The next Day wee discamped and pitched our Tents in the plaines of Arontes, the Scene of the intended Tragedy. As soone as we were quarter'd, we might perceive the Armenian Army marching downe the Hills of Fenistia in exact Order, and camped so, some forty Furlongs from us. By mutuall agreement both Armyes rested themselves two Dayes, that they might come the third unharrast to the Battell. In the meane tyme Moneses appoynted to every one his Command. The Prince honor'd me with the Leading of 2000. Horse, all Voluntiers, and composed of the Youth and Gallantry of Parthia, with whome I resolv'd to act something worthy the high Title of Parthenissa's Servant. At last the long desired Day appear'd, but so black and Cloudy; that it hardly deserv'd that Name, as if the Heavens had put on anticipated Mourning for so many succeeding Funeralls. Presently those vaste Playnes were cover'd with Armed troopes, And the Generalls having taken all the Advantages the Ground would permit; gave the Signall of the Battell: At the first Shock, the Field was strew'd with dead body's, and such a Shower of Arrowes were shot into the Ayre, that the Gods were hinder'd from seeing or relieving either Party. There were a thousand things perform'd which did better merit the Sunne for Spectator in all his Glory; than those sad and gloomy Clouds. But the Victory which was a long time in suspence, at last seem'd to declare it selfe on the Armenians side, by the Valour of a young Gentleman, who with neere 3000. Horse, carryed Death to his Enemies and Victory to his Friends wheresoever hee appear'd. So much Gallantry, I thought, was a fit Object for our Swords, and turning to my Friends I told them so, with this little addition, 'Tis too-low to imitate those that have done well: Let us be Examples to them to doe better, for you see the Day is lost, unlesse recover'd by our Valors, and Victory will now be so pretious; it cannot be too-deerely Courted, They all unanimously approv'd my Resolution, and presently I lead them where Artavasdes was (for so was this young Conqueror call'd) who perceiving our Designe, and guessing by our Countenance wee were not men to be slighted, presently rallyed all his Souldiers, who were eagerly pursueing the Parthians. By that time hee had drawne them up, I Charg'd him, telling my Companions, I would not inuite them to that which I would not be a Sharer in: I was so well seconded by those which followed me, that after a generous Resistance; wee broake those victorious Troopes, and had the Execution of them as long, as they had had it of ours, and I was so farre engag'd in the pursuite of this Route; that at last I perceiv'd the Standard Royall, which was guarded by at least 8000. select Men, which was to Me rather an Inuitation to attempt it, then the contrary, but least many might have beene of a Different principle, I told my Troope Companions, 'tis true, their Number surpasses ours, but you have just now learn'd, that Victory is woone by Vertue not by Multitudes, you have done things which will not be beleiv'd but by some such powerfull Witnesse, for to our owne Glory (but to our Countryes Shame) wee are not only the Actors, but almost the only Spectators, and as your Valors have no Limits, let your Successe be resembling. By one generall Acclamation, they protested they would follow me to Death or Victory, I gave them no time to coole, but by a succesfull Charge I made a Breach for them to enter, they lost not the Occasion, but with Vigour & Resolution improv'd it. As we had almost effected our designe, the same Artavasdes who had done such noble Actions in the beginning of the Battell, & was beaten by his mens Feares, not his owne (for they had carried him away in the Throng) rallyed againe some of his resolutest Troopes, & was come with them to relieve the King, which he did with so great Fury; that my Men lost all the Glory of their former Actions by an ignominious Flight, I could not believe it at the first, but seeing it was in earnest I cryed out, 'Tis your Swords not your Feete must save you, which you may effect by almost your desiring it, for the Enemy are not oblig'd to their Valours for this Disorder, but your Feares: If you doubt this Truth, doe but turne your Faces, and their Flight will assure you it. But when I perceiv'd they were as deafe to Me as to their Honors, I told some which were running by me: Is it thus then that you performe your engagement of following me to Death or Victory? I will never live to see your shame, nor to participate with you in it: Assure the Prince and my Father, I will sell my Life so handsomely; that it shall neither disgrace my Countrey nor my Blood. Having so said I thrust my selfe into the middst of the Enemy with a Resolution to dye, and invoking the faire Name of Parthenissa, my Rage made me doe things which my Courage only could not have perform'd, for I made a Lane through the thickest Troopes, and my Blowes were so happily directed, that wheresoever they did light once; they needed not to doe so a second time, Many of those which fledd, hearing my last words, turn'd about to know what I would doe, but when they sawe my resolution, and the unexpected successe which attended it, many who were gallant found my designe so much so, that they returned to share in it, and others who perceiv'd that those which thought to preserve their Lives did lose them, and that he which indeavour'd to lose his, did preserve it: the same cause which made them decline the Fight, made them returne to it. I must confesse, I was as much surpriz'd as pleas'd when I found my selfe so well followed, I imputed it to the invocation of Parthenissa, and was assur'd, that the same Power which hath occasion'd the greater Change, which was, to make those that fledd, to fight againe; would also performe the lesser, which was, to make those that return'd to fight overcome an Enemy they had so lately worsted. Whilst this heate lasted, we engag'd our selves so farre, that Feare produced the Effect of Courage, there being no Safety but in Victory: so that I had much adoe to credit my eyes, the last Testimony of my Companions valour, having quite defaced the former of their want of it: At last I perceiv'd one, who by the care they all shew'd of his preservation, I resolv'd was the King, which made me crye out, There fellow Souldiers, there is that which will make the conclusion of the Day more glorious than the progresse, and will both finish our Dangers and reward them too. They were so sensible of what I said, that their Valours gave an undeniable proofe of their being so; and the greedy desires I had to merit the Title of Parthenissa's Servant, made mee adresse my Designes onely at the King: concluding all consisted in the taking of Him, and though nature had deny'd mee a Crown yet by my Courage to present one to Parthenissa, I knew would be more pleasing to her generous disposition, which much more esteem'd the effects of Vertue, than those of Fortune, or Birth: To be short, after I had receiv'd some Wounds which were rather marks of Honour, than Danger, and after Revolutions and Confusions, which were deriv'd from the mingling amongst us of an other King of Armenia, at least one exceeding like the first, in his Armour and Furniture, as well as by the Horse he rid on, and disresembling him in nothing but what more pregnantly confirm'd Me he was the reall Artabazus, since the highest Vallor was fittest for the highest Title. I dismounted this Second Commer, whereby the First found and made use of the oportunity of escaping, which the Last no sooner observed, then he told mee, Generous Enemy, though my Body is at your Mercy, my Liberty is not, this Sword more kinde than Fortune, will soone ease mee of all the Miseries this Day has involv'd mee in, unlesse you will grant me one Condition, which if you doe not, I will deprive you of all those advantages you doe pretend unto by my Captivity; It is, that being a Prince, I may not be disarm'd, nor yeeld my selfe a Prisoner to any but your Prince. I thought it unjust to destroy a Valour as high as the Title of Him that possest it, and when my Enemy was too much in my power to remember he had been my Enemy, and yet I esteem'd it reasonable, that those who had been my Companions in Action, should be the like in Advice. I found all their Opinions proportionate to my own, which I inform'd him of, in such submissive tearmes, that hee assur'd us, Fate had in some sort repayred his Misfortunes, that being destin'd by his, to be a prisoner, he had fallen into hands which knew the respects due unto his quallity. 'Twas observable that in the taking of this Prisoner it seem'd wee had taken the Hopes of all his Party, at least depriv'd them of any but by Flight, which they so universally began and continu'd, that they gave us more trouble to kill then to breake them. At the end of the Execution I found Pacorus with a Ioy in his Countenance as great as his Successe, He imediatly rann to me, and after a Thousand Embraces assur'd me, that the King owed his Crowne and he himselfe his Life and Honor to Me, and that the Obligations were such, that it would be a Crime as great to hope the requiting them, as the Misfortune of the incapacity of doeing it: many other expressions of his Favour he honor'd me with, which I have now as absolutly forgotten; as I was then unworthy of them, But I remember I besought him to place those high Civilities rather upon my Companions than Me, as being an act of greater Iustice, & consquently more proportionat to his Inclination: But Sir (I continu'd) the Gods have not only fauour'd your Armes by an entire Defeate of your Enemyes, but by furnishing us with the Power of presenting you with the most considerable of them, as well for Title as Vertue. I then presented him with our Prisoner, at which, though his Ioy were very great, yet it was farre short of my amzement suddenly after, when the imagin'd King, pulling off his Helmet, discover'd a Face so full of Beauty and Courage equally mingled, that it produc'd in all of us the same effect it had in me, and a silence too as generall; which he begg'd a continuance of, and which the Prince having enjoyn'd, he addressd himselfe unto him in these termes. Sir, there is not one of the Armenians this day but I, that hath not just occasion to complaine against Forune, since in so publique a Calamity shee has yet furnisht me with meanes to serve my King, for I am not what I feign'd I was, but by seeming to be a King I preserv'd one. I know this declaration does surprize and insence many, but the Action is too- glorious to be conceal'd: I serv'd Artabazus in the beginning of the Battell by Force, but when Artabbanes Sword prov'd too powerfull to be resisted (for those were his very words) I then by Policy endeavour'd to performe, that which was deny'd mee by the other; My Ioy had been more perfect had my first designe succeeded, but yet I am not divested of all, since the last did: the end being still the same though the way be not: Some for this (Sir) might begg your Pardon, but I will not, for that were to confesse a Fault where there is none, neither will I so much as expect my Life at your hands, since that were to act with the Hope of something besides serving my King, which was what I only ambition'd. No generous Pacorus; consider that I, deprived you of a King to grace your Triumph, and put in practice what the consideration of that Losse inspires you with, so you will oblige your selfe by sacrificing to your Resentments One that has so highly injur'd you, and yet as highly gloryes therein, and you will oblige Me by making me a Martyr to my Duty and my Honor. The apprehension I had, least this confident (though generous) Speech of Artavasdes (for that was his Name) might invite Pacorus to conferre on him his Desires made mee tell him, Sir, I doe not finde that you have occasion to be offended at this Change, for 'tis not the Name of King, that can make us ever apprehend a contrary successe to that the Gods have given you this Day, but Vertue and Gallantry, and we have found so much of both, in this same Gentleman, that I believe the Armenians have suffer'd a greater losse, then if wee had taken their King, for his Perfections transcends that Title, and 'tis more worthy of your Armes to take the Gallantest, than the Greatest of your Enemyes: and Sir, to evince I doe not speake this to raise the value of the Present my Friends and I have offer'd you, I humbly beg Artavasdes Life, which wee shall not only receive as a Reward above the Services wee doe this day pay you; but above all wee can ever; for besides the preserving of so generous an Example for all Men to imitate, 'twould be an ill president to see a Prince punish a Subject, for being faithfull to his King. Pacorus who truly was generous, told me. If any thing could mak me offended with Artabbanes, 'twould be this unnecessary interceding: for the Services you have render'd mee, will drowne under the name of Gratitud to You, that good usage my Inclination leads me to conferr on the generous Artavasdes: But I here publiquely professe, that the Life I give him proceeds from a true sence of his Virtues, which I doe not only value, but admire, and if I may obtaine his Friendship, I shall esteeme it a happier purchase than that of his Person, or that of his Kings. Then addressing himselfe to Artavasdes he told him. If I were absolute Master of my Actions, I would from this instant restore you to that Liberty you have so meritoriously lost, but being accomptable to Arsaces, I shall beseech you to accompany mee to him, whether I shall suddenly goe, and I am so confident to obtaine your freedome, that I dare almost assure you it: besides, this small time may procure mee the happines of your acquaintance, which I so much value, that if I doe obtaine it, I shall justly believe tis the greatest advantage I derive from this dayes successe. To this high Civility Artavasdes repli'd, Sir, never till now was I perfectly vanquished, the fortune of Warre could give you but power over my Body, my Minde being free, retrench't you from the noblest Parte of your Victory, now 'tis entire, and you have made me as enamour'd of Life, as I was of Death, since by enjoying the former, I hope to finde an occasion to evince my Gratitude to him which gave it me. Many civilities past betweene them, and afterwards betweene Artavasdes and Me, whose friendship though I ambition'd with an infinit concerne, Yet as he afterwards assur'd me, it could not transcend that with which he desired mine. At the conclusion of these Civilities, Moneses came towards us: the Care he had of the Army, and of some wounds hee receiv'd in the Fight hindering him from being a Witnesse of their beginning, But the Prince seeing him comeing, went to meete him, and told him so many handsome Things of me, that I could not have beene more pleas'd to have deserv'd than I was asham'd to heare them. The next Day the Funeralls of the Dead were celebrated, and in one generall Fire the Parthian and Armenian Bodyes were reduced to Ashes. The season being very ill to prosecute the Warre, and the Numbers wee had lost rendring us unable to doe it, Pacorus resolv'd to returne to Ninive, whither he commanded me to attend him, that the people (as he said) might see their Deliverer. Artavasdes also waited on him. When wee came within Twenty Furlongs of that great City, Arsaces and all the Court came to meete the Prince, and congratulate his Successe. Pacorus would needs present Me to the King, and expressed so much Affection to mee in the Relation of that late Battell, that my Blushes will not permit mee to repeate it, nor the Civility Arsaces honor'd mee with. But all these Favours were as so many Obstacles to hinder me from waiting on the Faire Parthenissa, which after a Thousand importunate Ceremonyes I did. Who can expresse the vaste Felicity this favorable interview did blesse mee with? the many Comendations coming from that faire Mouth: those Raptures of Ioy for my safe returne, or those holy vowes of Constancy. But why doe I dwell so long upon this Subject, since it was but momentany, and serv'd but as a Prologue to those Miseries, which are as endlesse, as they are great. Artabbanes would have continu'd his Relation, but that Callimmachus being acquainted by his Servants that Supper was ready, besought him to deferre it till the Day following, which Artabbanes obeyed: and having only taken as much nourishment as would suffice Nature, hee retir'd into those magnificent Lodgings Callimmachus had prepared for him, where he past the Night as hee was accustomed to doe, which was, in the contemplation of his sadd Condition, that furnish'd him alwayes with so many Arguments for the impossibility of its alteration; that it made Dispaire to appeare Reason. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PARTE THE SECOND BOOKE. the impatient Callimmachus went to Artabbanes Chamber, to begg a continuance of that Story whose beginning had so satisfied him; But Symander assur'd him that his Prince was gone an houre before into the Grove of Cipresse to entertaine his Melancholly. Callimmachus (whose curiosity was so great that it was uncapable of delay, went presently to find him out, which after a diligent search he did, in one of the most retir'd and obscure Corners of it, and in a posture better expressing Sadnesse than Eloquence could; his back was lean'd against a withered Tree, his Eyes erected towards Heaven, his Armes folded one within the other, and so many Teares running down his Cheeks, that if moysture could have reviv'd that dead Trunck, it had needed no other raine for it's recovery. And that his words might expresse what his gestures did, Callimmachus heard him cry out. Yee Gods! must I never be acquainted with your Power but only through those Miseries you cast upon me by it? alas! why do you furnish me with so much Frailty, and yet provoke me so much to Dispaire? or why doe our Priests teach us there is a Providence; when you are so carefull by your Actions to evince the contrary? Then hanging downe his Head, hee continu'd in a perfect silence, 'till he himselfe broke it by a second Deluge of Dispaire, which drowning both his Devotion and Reason, necessitated him to expostulate thus with those with whom it was a Crime to doe it. But what Sinnes have I committed to deserve so deepe a suffering? yet allow my Guilt had been too-great for your Mercy, your Iustice might have inflicted a Punishment on my Person which might have equall'd my Offences; for you are no Gods if you are not infinit in all your Attributes, but being so; why did the faire Parthenissa suffer for my Fault? or else was it a more sensible way of persecuting Me, to doe it through Her? If this were your Designe  o Gods! I have more reason in exclayming against you, than you had, for imposing on me That which provokes me to it, and to afflict the Innocent to torment the Guilty, does rather argue Malice than Iustice. This impious reasoning frighted the good Callimmachus, who fearing least it should continue, discover'd himselfe, and by a sharpe and eloquent Reprehension disclos'd his Anger and the justice of it. To which Artabbanes reply'd, That if he were acquainted with his Miseries he would impute what he had then utter'd to his Sufferings and not to his Irreligion. Alas Artabbanes (said Callimmachus) how does your Passion blinde you? for you doe not consider that Sinne is as odious to the Deities as inseparable from Humanity, that 'tis an unexpressible Mercy they doe not involve us in all those Miseries their Power and Iustice is capable of: and whilst there is any Curse not yet inflicted on us, wee have more reason to esteeme them unjust for their Clemency, than for the contrary. 'Twas with such Truths as these that at last Callimachus disperst those Clouds of Dispaire which so darkned our unfortunate Lovers Piety, and then Conjured him to finish that Relation he had the Day before begun. To which Artabbanes reply'd: I entertain'd you the last night with the beginning of my own Story, but now I must in order to it, acquaint you with that of my Friends, the generous Artavasdes, who was taken Prisoner (as you heard) in the Battell of Arontes, and whose Gallantry had receiv'd a Punishment almost as great as it merited the contrary had not I had the happines to prevent it. The King of Armenia with the Reliques of his broken Army retreating into his own Kingdome, attempted a small Towne of the Parthians call'd Offala, immagining by the taking of so little, to disguise a losse which had been so great. The Garrison being inconsiderable as well for their Numbers as resolutions, at first summons condescended to a Treaty, and then to a Surrender, but had foure and twenty houres given them for the packing up their Baggage, during which, the Armenians had free accesse at their pleasure, which proved fatall to the Parthians, For Artabazus Souldiers, whether to revenge their Companions deaths at the precedent Battell, or out of some dispute which happen'd betwixt those of the Army and the Garrison (as the Armenians gave it out) put all that were in Offala as well Citizens as Souldiers most barbarously to the Sword: which Newes, as soone as it came to Arsaces knowledge, so infinitly transported him, that hee vow'd, the Generous Artavasdes Blood should expiate his Kings Crimes, and be a Sacrifice to the Manes of his murder'd Subjects. And though Pacorus represented how unjust a Revenge this was, being a violation of that Quarter of his Life which hee had too-generously hazarded, to loose it in a way which was so much the contrary, yet the King vowed by his Fathers Ashes (an oath that he never mention'd but afterwards he was unalterable) that Artavasdes should dye. I was present when this sadd determination was taken up, & finding how unlike my Perswasions were to deserve that name; I resolv'd to prevent my freinds Ruine, and hinder my Prince from acting it, in a way too as unfitting for him, as the Punishment was unworthy the Person for whom it was intended. To effect this I went instantly to looke Artavasdes out, for (though a Prisoner) without any engagement he had what liberty he desired. After a diligent search I found him in a wildernes of one of the Pallace Gardens, where having acquainted him with what had happen'd, and what was resolv'd, I begg'd him to retire a private way that lead to my Lodgeings, where he might remaine secure 'till his escape were beleiv'd so certaine that that it self might contribute to it: But his Generosity was so great (knowing the Danger would be so in which I should fall were he discover'd) that his Care of Me had like to have render'd Mine fruitles for Him, for it was so long before I could prevaile with him to accept of his Safety by a hazard of mine, that the Kings Guards were already abroade for his Committall and had not the way beene very priuate to my Chamber wee had (doubtlesse) beene discover'd before we had reach't it: but we came at last safe thither, where I commanded Symander to waite on him, and permit no other of my Servents that honor, nor to know of his being there, From thence I went to learne what course was taken for his Discovery, and how fayling in it was relisht; I was soone acquainted, that all the Gates of Ninive were shut, and that one Rysolis a friend of Mine was that Night with some of the Guarde to follow Artavasdes (in case he were not found out before his departure) and that his beleived escape had so much exasperated the King, that he gave strict order none should passe the Gates without his owne Lycense 'till Rysolis retourne, who by chance I found as he was preparing himselfe for his Iourny, and by his expressions quickly observ'd how much the office displeas'd him; His affection to vertue & to Me, made me discover to him where Artavasdes was concealed, and conjur'd him to let him pass as one of his Troope & therby render what was intended for his Ruin, the meanes of preventing it. This Request found a readdy retourne, for he was as joyfull to serue Me, as unwilling to obey his King in so vnjust a Commande; Then having promis'd me that within two or three howers he would call at my Lodgings and undertake my Desires, wee separated our selves, he to prepare himselfe, and I to acquaint Artavasdes with his Civility, who embrac't it with moderation, and then told me. If I thought it would not be too-great a trouble to you I would employ the tyme I have left, in telling you the perticulers of a Life you are so earnest to preserve. To which I replyde, that it was a favour I should have passionatly begg'd of him had not the apprehension of being thought too-curious, been more prevalent with me than my owne Satisfaction, but since he was pleas'd to make that Overture which nothing else had hinderd me from making, I would listen to his Adventures with an attention which should speake how highly I was concern'd in them. Artavasdes having told me; I could not be concern'd in any thing that was more mine, than himselfe, began this ensueing Sory. time admitted with a Ioy that was so, it is over myne, but then I speak as great a Truth when I assure you that this Extraordinary effect had a Proportionat cause, and that the Beauty, which Prints her Image in me, does it with a stampe as pleasing as indelible, and to know this the more perfectly you must first understand that my Father whose name is Annexander, is a Prince that possesses the highest power in all Armenia, and derives his Pedegree from Auncestors whose antiquity and vertue have made them equally famous, And though they never had the Glittering trouble of a Crowne (which Succession and not Vertue commonly casts on Men) yet they never wanted one of Lawrell; it seemes too, that the Fates distin'd our Family to furnish a General to the Armenians, for in Nyne descents successively, one of it had alwayes that Honor, and possest vertues, of so Peculiar a Quallity that with Truth I may say they have been as glorious in their Actions, as our Kings in their Titles. My Father, who has nothing degenerated from his Predecessors, is so intirely Master of all those reallities and ornaments which renders a Gentleman worthy that Name, that Artabazus our present King as a reward of his services (which were the placeing of his Father and him in the Throne of Armenia) gave his Aunt the faire Lindesia to him for his Wife, from which marriage I had the honor to Proceed, But before I doe so in my Discours I must make a litle digression to give you a Caracter of those persons I shalbe necessitated to mention in it. Our King had another Aunt married unto Celindus, who was a Prince inrich't with many good qualities, but his naturall ambition (which received so great an accession from this allyance) made him employ them in such Cryminall Desines, that they prov'd more distructive to his perticular and to his friends, than if they had been vices. Artabazus has but one Sister, much about the age of his only legittimate Sonn the Prince Tygranes (which is a name asmuch effected by the royall blood of Armenia, as Arsaces is by that of Parthia,) these two have abundantly evinc't that the Body is the Molde of the Soule, for Tygranes shape is so horrid that nothing can transcend it but his conditions, and truely the first is only tollerable but because it manifest's what the second is. But the Princesse Altezeera has all the guifts of Nature in so unaccessionatll a Degree, that nothing can excell the perfectnesse of her body but that of her Minde, whose Morning though adorned with all that so tender a youh was capable of, gave but an imperfect earnest of what her Noone did produce. I must confesse I was not so much Master of my own Affections as not to burne at so pleasing a Fire, but resented a paine which 'till then I never was acquainted with, for shee had so equall a proportion of Divinity and Beauty, that my Flame participated so equally of desire,  & adoration, that neither could supresse the other. oh Gods, could I but tell you Artabbanes what shee is, I should have your exquse for what I did, which was that I resign'd my Liberty with more Ioy then any other could have recover'd his. But yet my Flame was as invisible as great, for I concluded the Beauty being extraordinary, the way ought to be so, in which I disclos'd that I Adored Her. After an Admiration and silence of a yeare, according to the Common Computation, but an age according to mine, such Torments are ther in a concealed fire. My Father, (who admired the high vertue of the Romans, alwaies held a proportionat correspondency with them, partly out of a sence of their Gallantry as also to make use of their Power and Iustice in case Celindus should Rebell, who wanted not the will but the opportunity to doe it) To acquire himselfe more intimatly their Freindship, & to instruct me in their civill & Military discipline, sent me to Rome whither I willingly went, hoping that successe in Glory, might be the way to Successe in Love. After I had observ'd the most beneficiall things there, I came to the Army of Lucullus who was by the Senates orders makeing then a Bloody Warre against Mithridates, in which expedition I gave some such proofes of my Courage that he offer'd me any Commad which a stranger might pretend unto. I declin'd this great Civility by alleaging that my unexperience aswell as yeares, made me fitter to obey, than Command, that my Cheifest desire was to have the honor to be neere his person, and that any office which should deprive me of that ende, would be rather a punishment than a preferment; Not to trouble you with too-many perticulers, though I would not take upon me any Charge, yet I so fully satisfyed Lucullus with my refusall, that he never declin'd, nay, rather augmented his Affection for me, and sent Ltetters, in my fauour to the Sennate: but that I was more lustly Proude of than all this, was a perfect friendship I then Contracted with the Generous Ventidius, a Roman Patrician, who was even to wonder blest with all the Graces of Nature and Education. About this tyme my Father, to make the Romans Place a higher value on me, sent Two Hundred young Gentlemen, of the chiefest Families in Armenia to serve under me, which the Roman Generall much approv'd, & with whome I dare without vanity say, I did so many services that he (thought of an extra-ordinary ambitious nature) was yet so just as often to attribute much of the Glory of his Successe to our Valours. I will not tell you the events of that Warre whilst I was in it, since the miseries of Mithridates & the Fame of Lucullus are yet so recent. But Annexander who began to suspect that Artabazus who absolutly declin'd Mithridates in the beginning, would now assist him, the Roman successe rendring him Iellous of it, commanded me to retourne into my owne Country, after two yeares absence, which summons I obey'd, and went home with Letters to my King and my Father, more fill'd with Lucullus Prayses, than Truth, All those young Gentlemen which had 'scaped the fury and uncertainty of Warre retourn'd with me. The desire we had to see our Freinds, and I perticularly to behold the faire object of my Passion, which was much increast by absence (for Love has that property, that as long as it has an existence, it will have a growth) made us so to hasten, that in fifteene Dayes wee arriv'd upon the confines of Armenia, & having a desire not to give any warning of our arrivall, that wee might the more agreeably surprize all those who were concern'd in it, wee marched with our Helmets on, and with as litle rest as the necessity of our Trauell would permitt. The sixth day after our coming into Armenia just as the Sunn began to enlighten the World, wee might perceive from the topp of the Hill wee then were on, the Citty of Artaxata, The sight of that place, the then Residence of Altezeera so transported me with Ioy, that in the contemplating of being so neere Her I discontinv'd travelling, & having stopt my horse, offer'd some vowes to the God of Love that he would inspire the Excellency I ador'd with a trve knowledg of the greatnesse of my Flame, and incline her to recompence it, but only according to the vastnesse & vertue of it. Observe I beseech you in this accident how the Gods favour the Innocent, and by how strange meanes they worke out their deliverance. That litle Rapture I was fallen into, had caus'd all the Company to stand, and as I tould you, it was in the place from whence wee might see Artaxata, and those in it, and in the adjacent plaine betwixt the Citty and the Hill, might discover us; by that tyme I was beginning to descend the Hill, we discry'd a Horsman that came out of a wood some Thirty furlongs from the Towne, gallopping towards us, and I by chance being a good way before my Company, he no sooner came within call then he Comanded me to tell Palisdes from Celindus, that the King & Altezeera were but newly come out that wee should retourne to our station, and not appeare 'till Tuminius were engaged This unexpected Message much amaz'd me, yet as soone as I heard those names I began to suspect some treachery, for by my Fathers frequent Letters, when I was in the Roman Campe, he acquainted me, that he had too-well-grounded jealousies of Celindus ill inclinations to usurpe the Crowne, and therfore turning about, I comanded my Company to doe the like, and as soone as we were out of the sight of Artaxata I left Celindus'es Souldier in charge with one of myne, commanding him not to discover himselfe or us, and to have a care of what was Committed to his. Then I went and order'd my faithfullest Servant Philanax to light off his Horse, to hide himselfe amongst some Trees on the topp of the Hill, and never to have his Eye off the plaine, but as soone as he should see any fighting, immediatly to give me warning of it; I then placed Scouts upon all the adjacent heights, whom I Comanded to give me advertisement of what they should discover: Having thus disposed of things, I retourn'd to my Troope, assembled the chiefest of it, and acquainted them of the Iealousies I had that Celindus intended some Treachery to the King and Altezeera, how that many things concurr'd to change that suspition into certainty, as that of the Souldiers takeing us for a Troope that were to execute something by Celindus his orders, that apparently the dsigne was upon Artabazus & Altezeera by his saying they were but just then come out, That his nameing Tuminius, and takeing us for Palisdes Troope, argued there were many in the enterprize; in a word, all those circumstances concuring they were confirm'd in my beliefe, & after a small consultation we resolv'd (the tyme being so short) to make Celindu's Souldier confesse the whole Conspiracy, either by faire meanes or by torment; In order to which wee went, & told him we were not Palisdes his Troope, but Strangers comeing from the Warrs, and retourning to our Country, that wee had heard much of Celindus Gallantry, that wee concluded his designe was vertuous, and that if it weare communicated to us, we might doe him service, The Souldier who had a quick apprehension finding all was lost, unlesse by some subtlety he remedy'd it, answer'd us, I guesse the designe is noble by the undertakers of it, but my quality is so lowe, that I only act in the obedience of my Officers Commands, and not being able to informe you of the enterprize, I shall advise you to send with me some of your Party to Celindus who is not above twenty furlongs hence, & I make no doubt, if Vertue or Reward will engage you in his attempts, you shall want neither. We quickly found by his way of speaking, that his condition was not so meane as he would have perswaded us, & therfore concluding he had some designe by so plausible a pretence to free himselfe out of our hands, & that no faire wayes would prevaile, pulling off my Helmet, I made my selfe knowne unto him, and drawing out a Punnyard which I wore constantly, I vow'd by all those oathes which Men have most reason not to violat, That if he disclos'd not the whole designe, I would instantly kill him, but if he would I'de not only engage my selfe for his pardon, but to give him as high Rewards for his tourning honest, as he could pretend unto, if his wickednesse had it's wisht successe. I added to those Threatnings and promises all the Arguments my Iudgement could furnish me with to lay upon the deformity of His hopes. The certainty of so sudden a Death, and the horror of Conscience, made him by many sighes acquaint us with his repentance, and that he desir'd no greater reward, than to have beene keept from doeing ill. He then inform'd me that his name was Evaxes, That he was one of the Chiefest in this conspiracie, and that all those who were engag'd in it, put on Common-Souldiers habitts, that in case the designe succeeded not, they might remaine undiscover'd: That he had beene drawne in by Celindus charming eloquence, who having had some vent of Anexanders suspition of him, had with-drawn himselfe into the Province of Saccasene where he was Prince and Governor as well by Interest as Commission or Birth, That Celindus was resolv'd to kill the King, and to marry Altezeera to Tuminius, his eldest Sonne: That the Prince Tygranes was privy to the plott, but would not appeare openly, 'till he sawe what Successe it had, but that Celindus had only engag'd him in it, to make his party the Stronger, and for an invitation thereunto he was promis'd to be continued in the Throne after Artabazus Death, he haveing in retourne engaged himselfe to give the Princesse Altezeera to Tuminius, which should be no sooner effected, than Celindus was resolved to make Tygranes away too, and thereby settle the Crowne upon his owne Posterity, the Lawes of the Armenians not excluding the female Sexe: That to effect this he had sent divers Troops out of his Government to lye in the places adjacent, and that they might not be suspected, the Troopers came by two and three in a Company, disguis'd in the habitts of Peasants, and carryed their Armes so privatly, that it was impossible to discover them, That haveing learned by his Intelligences the King & Altezeera were to hunt that Day, he had sent Tuminius with 200. Horse, which lay in Appollo's Grove, who was to kill the King and those that follow'd him, and to carry Altezeera to the ruin's of an old Chappell, where & in a small Bottom Celindus & some 300. Horse lay to secure his retreate to Artemita, whis is the first Towne in his Government, and is but an hundred furlongs from hence: that Palisdes (Celindus other Sonne) was appointed with 500. Horse more to continue upon the Hill wee then were on, least Anexander (who to prevent any ill accidents had drawne 500. Horse into Artaxata) should releive the King and the Princesse before they came to Artemita, where there was a considerable body of Foote, and the rest of the Army (with which he design'd to reduce all forces or places that should oppose him) were quarter'd not above 20. furlongs off. This Relation (my Deere Artabbanes continv'd Artavasdes) gave me as much Horror as Amazement, and while I was enquiring what might be the cause that Palisdes was not come, one of my Scouts came gallopping in and told me, he discover'd a body of about 500. Horse, not eight furlongs off, that came on a round trott almost the same way wee had martched. This Troope wee easily immagin'd was Palisdes, whome I resolv'd to charge, But first of all dispatch't away an Expresse to my Father to acquaint him with what I had learn'd, and to conjure him to send out as many Horse as possibly he could spare under some good Commander, but not lead them himselfe, lest the Towne might be betray'd in his absence. Evaxes assur'd me thereupon, that Artaxata would be lost if he were once out of the Walls, for Celindus had many Partisans there that waited only such an opertunity to betray it. This being done, I began to order my Troope which consisted of 150. But of so cleere Valours and resolutions, that those vertues supply'd the defects of their Numbers. But Evaxes who perceiv'd my designe begg'd me not to put all to the hazard, haveing so few Men, & having to deale with those whose resolutions were as great as their Crymes, that he had thought upon a Stratagem, which might effect my designe without the hazarding it, which was, that he would goe acquaint Palisdes that Celindus had sent him purposely to assure him that Artabazus and Altezeera were upon some intelligence retourn'd, and that therefore he should immediatly disperse those 500. Horse into their severall Quarters with Orders to be in the same place the next morning, if they receiv'd no fresh ones to the contrary: That he with the chiefest of his friends, should come into the little valley neer the Ruines of that olde Chappell, where they would cousult what was most expedient to be done, upon the intelligence they had and could learne. This said Evaxes, you neede not be diffident wee'l have a wish't successe, for Palisdes knowing the power I have with Celindus will obey any Orders I shall bring him in his name. But he continu'd you may suspect I will betray you and lay this designe for the obtaineing of my Liberty, which I would have you beleeve is for the securing of the Kings: I must confesse my former undertaking has beene such; that all the civill Man is capable of, may be believed in me, with some appearance of Iustice: but I invoke the Gods to be my witnesse and begg them to be my Punnishers, if my Heart and my words are not the same: but I will not desire that obligation of you, as to credit me, send a couple of these Gentlemen along, One at my right hand, and the other on my left, and if I faile in my engagement let them peirce me with their lavelins, and let that be my Reward. This discourse of Evaxes had something of probability in it, and knowing it was but fighting, (which I was determin'd to doe) in case he should betray me; I resolv'd rather to trust absolutly to him, (which if he had any Principle of vertue) would binde him then to evidence it, than by sending two Gentlemen with him expose them to an unavoydable losse, as likewise by trusting of him but in parte, invite him thereby to be false in the whole. Having made this my Election I told him, Goe Evaxes, & by so handsome an action eface the guilt of all your precedent Crimes, you shall be accompany'd by nothing but your goodnesse, which I know wilbe a greatar, confinement to you to doe well, than if all our swords were at your Brest to punish you, should you doe otherwise. To which Evaxes reply'd, that if he had beene still in the darknesse of his former Principles so perfect a Truth would have lighted him into the way of vertue: having so said, he advis'd me to withdrawe my selfe into a small Bottome nighe the high-way, that I might remaine undiscover'd 'till the Enemy were in the Toyle, and that I would send one along with him to the topp of the next Hill, to give me warning when Palisdes and his Friends should aduance, and to advertice me, if I were betray'd. These last words he said smyling, and I haveing told him that I would send one for the first reason, but not for the last, Evaxes gallop't away, accompany'd with a Gentleman, whome he placed upon a riseing ground, where he might easily discover the effect of his Embassy; To be breife, Evaxes so orderd his Affaires with Phlisdes, that he sent back his Troopes, and came along accompany'd with twenty of his Freinds, that were the chief of the Conspiracy, who carelesly Rideing fell into our hands, and though surpriz'd, made so gallant a resistance, that Tenn of them were kill'd before wee could reduce the rest; Those that remain'd alive (in which number was Palisdes, though somewhat wounded) wee resolv'd to present unto the King, that Iustice not force, might be their Executioner: Having thus happily begunn our first enterprize, Evaxes offer'd to endeavour the delivery of Celindus into our hands by the like stratagem, but we were interrupted by Philanax, who came all out of breath, and told me that he saw many Souldiers in the Playne, who fought so furiously that it was easy to be immagin'd the gaineing of the victory was very considerable to them, but that the Number was as unequall, and that those which were the lesser seemed to have nothing but their resolutions to keepe them from being uanquished. The great apprehension I had least my reliefe might not come tyme enough, gave me wings, so that though I came not so soone as I desir'd, yet I had this consolation, that I omitted nothing which was in my Power. When I was within some fewe paces of the Scene where this bloody Tragedy was acting, I might perceive a small company of Gentlemen, that had cast themselves into a Ring, and in the hollow of the circle had placed one who I immagin'd was the King, and defended him with courages fiitter to be admir'd than describ'd; but their vertue was yeelding to their Enemyes Numbers, had not Wee then come to their Rescue, and the sight of so much barbarousnesse haveing inspir'd me and mine with as much fury, wee fell upon them with such violence that wee reduced them to that condition which their Rebellion deserv'd. Artabazus (for it was he) findeing himselfe so miraculously preserved came to me (for he found by the respect all those of my Troope pay'd me, that I was their cheife) and told me; That he must attribute so miraculous a deliverance to the Tutelary Gods of Armenia, whose Alters should speake hin gratefull, and whose Instruments in his preservation should finde Him so if any thing in his power could doe it, and therfore he desir'd to know those to whom he owed his Life. Wee told him, that as soone as all was ended wee should satisfie his Commands and in the meane tyme we assur'd him, that we had the Honor to have so neere a dependance on him, that all our actions were so farr from meritting, that they were lesse than our dutyes: But Sir (I continnude blushing and trembling) I beseech you what is become of the Princesse. Alas (said the King) in the beginning of the Fight, I sent her away under the conduct of Nearchus with twenty Gentlemen more, whom I soone observ'd were follow'd by nere thrice as many of the Rebells, what successe Nearchus and his Companions have had I know not, but I am fearfull by the Sacrifising of their Lives, they have only therby assur'd their fidelity, and the conquest of their Enemyes; As the King was speakeing, there came towards us one of the Princesse Pages who seeing the number of the Dead, immagin'd that it was the Kings party defeated, and turning about sought his preservation in the swiftnesse of his Horse; But the Livery being knowne, & guessing at his mistake, I follow'd and cry'd out to him, that wee were the Kings Servants, and desir'd to know where the Princesse was; but his feare made him suspect every one that had but a Sword in his hand, and certainly wee had not overtaken him, had not his too-much haste been the cause of it, For his horse being runn off his Leggs, fell so heavily, that I had leasure to come upp to him, and haveing inquir'd where the Princesse was, I could gett no other answer from him but Quarter, Quarter, and indeed he was so really possest that I was one of Tuminius his party, that nothing I could say for a long tyme could make him beleeve the contrary; but at last some of the Kings Servants being come, he perceiv'd his Error, and then told us. That Nearchus with those twenty Gentlemen he had taken with him, were, when he came away for reliefe, generously disputing the Princesse safety in so advantageovs a place, that none could come behinde, and but five a brest before, but that most of them were dangerously wounded, and if they had not a sudden Releif, they would be uncapable of any. I commanded the Page immediatly to shew me where they were, and haveing gotten some twenty of my Freinds with me, I left the rest to guarde the King, and flew with them to the place where the Princesse was. Gods! what fury was I possest with when I sawe the poore Nearchus with fower more disputing Altezeera's safety, I fell upon them with all the Rage her Danger could Inspire me with, and cry'd out, currage brave Nearchus, the Gods who are concern'd in Altezera's innocency, and your valour have sent them both this Reliefe. My generous Companions who were equally animated with me, did actions almost worthy the cause they fought for, and Nearchus finding so unexpected a succours, gave proofes of an exceeding high Courage; but we found Tuminius his Numbers might in tyme have made our successe dobtfull, and knowing the influence a Commander has over his Men, I calld out to him: 'Tis I Tuminius, that am come to take from thee Altezeera, if thy valour flye as high as thy desires, thou should'st by killing the Ravisher of them, manifest to that faire Princesse thou hast a Resolution able to overcome all obstacles that dare oppose it. Tuminius who wanted not courage answer'd me: If there needs but the killing of Thee, to assure her that Truth, shee shall not long doubt it; and would to the Gods I could as easily vanquish her disdaine as all my other Enemyes: He had no sooner done speakeing than he made himselfe a lane thorough the Throng, and I haveing separated my selfe from my Companions, Commanded them to lett us alone 'till Death or Victory decided the quarrell. Tuminius having order'd his Men the like, wee begann to fight, but with so much earnestnesse, as if the Conqueror had expected Altezeera for his Reward; I must confesse, I was so asham'd that one guilty Man, in the presence of my Princesse and for her safety too, should dispute so long the victory, that I prest him so vigorously, and so unfortunatly for him, that my Sword at last having found the defect of his Armor, peirc'd him through and through, at which thrust he fell, and with that streame which issu'd from his wound, he Breath'd out his Life. All my frends made a great shoute at my successe, and fell so briskly on Tuminius Souldiers, that by their fury, and by the losse of their Commander, wee had a Victory so cheape that it hardly deserved that name. The field being wholly ours I lighted off my Horse, and with an infinite humility went to Altezeera, and told her. Madam, The Gods of whome you are so Perfect a Coppy, have sent me hither, to serve you against your Enemyes, and have given you an entire victory, least their Iustice or Power by your losse or want of Revenge might have beene call'd in question. I must confesse said shee the actions I have seene you doe for my deliverance assure me, 'tis more than a humaine power which has effected it, but the Gods whose delight is to releeve the Innocent made me not dispaire of their helpe, though the meanes ('till your arrivall) was unseene: But Sir shall I desire you to add two favours unto this I have already receiv'd? that I may know to whome I owe the preservation of my Life, and perhaps my Honor, and that if there be any hope of rescveing my Brother you would employ your Sworde in so just a Quarrell. Madam (I reply'd) my Name has beene so little beholding to my Actions, that by them it is not considerable, but for the King, I have already had the happinesse to serve him, and if I be not mistaken, that Troope which you see marching this way attends him by my orders; How? (said Altezeera;) does Artabazus as well as I, owe his safety to your Sword? sure then your Name cannot be so unconsiderable as you would make me beleeve it is, or if it has beene, it is so no longer; but I am confident you will not discover it, to hinder us from being ungratefull, which unavoydable wee muste be, if once we learne to whome we are indebted. Madam (I reply'd) to take you out of that Error I will acquaint you who I am, that you may knowe I have only hazarded a Life in your service, which I am resolv'd to spend in the same employment: Then pulling off my Hellmet, shee no sooner sawe my Face but shee cry'd out 'tis Artavasdes! and ther wanted nothing to make my Ioy as perfect as my safety, but to owe the latter to his Gallantry; just as I was goeing to reply, the King (who had learn'd by some of my Troope who I was) & by one of those who escaped Tuminius sword, what I had done, came running to me, and having embraced me a thousand tymes, told me, I see Artavasdes that vertue is borne with us, not infused into us by Education, otherwise you could not be possessor of so great a quantity in so tender an Age. Sir (said I) your goodnesse being too great, makes you place a resembling value upon my services, & I should be guilty of an equall presumption if I did not attribute your expressions to any thing sooner than your Iustice, But Sir let not the Ioy of your safety hinder us from receaveing the benefit of it, nor me from bringing this Gentleman to kisse your hands who has washt away his cryminall intensions by his gallant performance. Thereupon I presented Evaxes to the King, who acquainted him with all Celindus and Tygranes desines, and that wee had taken Palisdes, who being shew'd to the King discover'd asmuch guilt in his Face, as he had in his Heart: Artabazus comanded he should be safely keept, & ratifyed all I had promis'd to Evaxes; then learning that Celindus had yet 300. Horse betwixt us and the Towne, wee thought it not fitt to loose any tyme, & therefore having by Artabazus comand & her permission taken the faire Altezeera behind me, & orderd our men, we began to retire towards Artaxata, when our Scouts came immediatly and brought us word that Celindus with above 400. Horse (for feare multiplyes) was marching directly towards us, and was but six furlongs off. As soone as I heard it, I turn'd aboute to the Princesse, & told her, Madam, I am in a greater conflict with my selfe, then I can have with the Enemy, whither I should comitt you to the charge of some Gentleman swiftly Horst, & indeavor to secure your Retreate, or else by dying at your Feete, take the oppertunity to acquaint you, with that which I shall not have the confidence to doe, whilst I am sure to outlive the discovery, To which shee answer'd, I have so good an opinion of Artavasdes that I shall esteeme my selfe as safe under his Sword as in Artaxata, & I cannot conceave, that his Heart is capable of any thing, which his words dare not reveale. Madam (I reply'd) I must confesse I am guilty of a Cryme but the cause of it is so glorious, that if it were not comitted against you, I should not call any effect that proceeded from it by such a name, But Madam, the Enemy approaches, and I must put you in some place of safety, that I may by the hazarding of my Life secure yours, & would to the Gods, the losse of myne could give you as perfect a security, as the ending of it in your service would give me a Satifaction. The King by this tyme, was come so neere us, that I could not receive any answer from my Princesse, and askt me what order I would settle for the receiving of so bold a Gest, for he was determin'd to derive his preservation wholly from my Sword: I answer'd, so Large a favour with a resembling humility, and having conjur'd Nearchus to have a care of the Princesse, I lighted from my Horse, tooke downe Altezeera, and set her up behinde him, then kissing her hand, I told her softly Madam, inspire me by your command, that I may performe things worthy your looking onn, and remember if I dye in the acting of them, you loose the faithfullest Servant that ever your perfections did acquire you: But shee was so perplext (whither through apprehension or any other cause) that shee only answerd me in Teares, which neverthelesse, comeing from her faire Eyes, enflam'd me with as high a fire, as ever they shott into any Lovers Heart: Celindus by this tyme was come so neere, that I had only leasure to conjure the King, that he and the Princesse would flye to Artaxata, whilst I amuz'd the Enemy, and having left 50. Horse for their Guard, I devided those that remain'd into two bodyes, as the Enemy had done theirs, and having in few Words told my Companions how highly they were oblig'd to their fortunes that had furnisht them with an occasion to shew their valours before, & for the greatest Monarch of the East, & the fairest Princesse of the World, and how the Victory which was the onely way to preserve them was as certaine as their Cause was just; I began the Charge and fighting under the conduct of Iustice, Honor, & Love, I soone made a Breach for my valient friends who being carryed onn with a generous desire, Rowted that wing wee attempted, and thereby made a passage for Nnearchus, who lost no opportunity, but got bye with the King & Princesse. But Sratolis, who commanded the left wing of our Horse, had not so good successe, for though he disputed the businesse with sufficient Courage; yet he was overpower'd, & at last worsted, so that in effect wee were but as wee begunn, for what I had gain'd he had lost, only the King & Altezeera by my good fortune gott that other of passing by. Wee instantly rallyed againe, & determin'd only by skirmishinge to make good our Retreate, and not to hazard all at one Charge, least if foyld, the King & the Princesse might not recover Artaxata. Our Resolutions had such good successe, that I held the Enemy in play longe enough for Nearchus designe had not the subtile Celindus immagin'd, that I would fend the King and the Princesse away with a small Guard, and with the rest Iustifye the Retreate, which caus'd him to lay a hundred Horse in Ambush betwixt us & the Towne, who falling suddenly upon Nearchus so terrified his Men, that most of them were cutt-off, before they put themselves in a posture of resistance. One of the Runn-awayes fled to me, and with a Countenance which acquainted me with his feare, told me, all was lost, if I did not instantly remedy it, I left most part of my Horse with Stratolis, who I commanded to amuze the Enemy, and with some Thirty of my friends, rann to the place where my helpe was so needfull, But alas, the first thing I sawe was a rude Souldier, who had unmounted Artabazus, and was goeing to plant his Punyard in his Brest. This impious Action gave me so just a resentment that I clove with one stroake the offendors head in two, and leaping off my Horse, mounted the King upon him, & seised on another that ran about the field without a Master. But Gods! to how unparalell'd a height was my Anger rais'd when the peirceing shreekes of the faire Altezeera reacht my Eares. For Nearchus being kill'd, one of Celindus Officers had seiz'd on her and was carrying her away: I professe Ingeniously my deare Artabbanes, that sight did so transport me, that I thinke a Leagion could not have hinder'd me from releving her danger or killing the Causer of it. So that having made a passage through the throng, I soone made another through him, & by that thrust, depriv'd him both of his Life, and Hopes. Then takeing the overjoy'd Altezeera behinde me, I went to the King, whome we overtooke retreating towards Artaxata, but when we were come within some Tenn Furlongs of it, wee discover'd a Body of neere 500. Horse comeing towards us in a cloud of dust, as fast as they could gallopp. Altezeera who had generously oppos'd all perills, now began to faint, but I told her Madam, the Gods who have hitherto protected you, have thereby taught you not to despaire, and I am confident you are so highly cherisht by them, that if nothing but a Miracle can effect your preservation yet you shall not be denide it, or fall into your Enemyes hands, at least that Fate shall not be yours, whilst I have a Sword or Life to oppose it, my duty and a higher consideration exacting it from me; I begg'd her therfore not to contribute to the danger, by being astonnisht at it, nor to let goe her hold for I was confident fighting for so transcendent a Perfection, my courage would proportion my Cause: having thus said shee embrac'd me, with so greate a satisfaction for the transported Artavasdes, that had it proceeded from Love, as it did from Feare, I had wanted little of a perfect happinesse; but though the effect came from a wrong cause, yet I blest the danger that gave me so high a contentment: but alas her apprehension soone ended, and my Ioy with it, for we found it was the yong Amidor my Brother, who by my Fathers command was come out to rescue us, having receaved that advertisement I had sent him. In this generall satisfaction I alone was extreamly perplext, having bought the publique security at too-deere a rate for my perticular, yet the consideration that by it Altezeera was out of danger, whose contentment I still preferr'd before my owne, did soone banish all those sadd thoughts, and having sent 200. of those Horse under my Brother to helpe Stratolis, with the rest wee martched to Artaxata, where Anexander, and all the Citty, reciv'd us with Faces that spoake their contentments. It were supperfluous to tell you what Artabazus said to my Father, and all those with him in my favour, I will therefore only acquaint you, that Altezeera, (whose Beauty was growne to such perfection, that it made me almost irreligious, by desireing to see noe other happinesse) having lead me aside told me, Artavasdes, I should too-much wrong my resentments if I could hope to discribe them, To save me from Tuminius Insolency, and his Passion, are obligations of so high a Nature, that they resemble his vertues which conferr'd them on me. Madam (I reply'd) in serveing you I have perform'd my Duty, and receiv'd my Reward, But Madam had Tuminius the conconfidence to make his addresses to you? He had (said shee) and would have perswaded me, that this enterprize was only the effect of his Love, not his Fathers Ambition. Alas Madam (I answer'd) then he was pardonable, if at least he is so, that cannot avoyde committing of His fault. How? (said Altezeera:) now you know the Cause of his Crime, you seeme to approve it. No Madam (I reply'd) but pitty his inevitable fate; I say inevitable, because experimentaly I finde it so; This I spoake in disorder and trembling, but Alas I had immediatly much more cause for both when I heard her say, Ah Artavasdes, I have beene too- patient, and by my not suppressing your first inconsideratnesse, have thereby authoriz'd what you have since committed, yet I give this Presumption to your services, but lett me have no Repeticions of it, least you force me against my inclination to become your Enemy; shee was goeing away with that reply, but I Conjur'd her before shee went only to beare Myne, which shee said shee graunted not to me but the Company, who otherwise might suspect in her disorder the cause of it. Madam (said I) the same consideration hinders me from flinging my selfe at your Feete, and begging your forgivenesse, and though I thought Tuminius excusable in dareing to adore you, knowing by my selfe how impossible it was to doe otherwise; yet I held him withall so worthy of Revenge, that to be sure he should not avoyde it, I inflicted it on him with my owne hands, and before you see me next, you shalbe convinc't, I will not practice what I Condemne, and that I can Punnish as well as commit a fault. These words I deliver'd with a Countenance and accent as sad as themselves, which the faire Altezeera was so sensibly moov'd with, that shee told me. Though your Cryme be great yet I desire no other Reparation, but that you will not Repeate it: And since you assure me I have an Empire over you larger then I thought, evince that truth I conjure you by attempting nothing against your Life. I shall obey you Madam (I reply'd) but I beseech you, receive this obedience as the highest demonstration of it that I am capable of, for my Torments are as farre from being describ'd, as (I feare) they are from being cur'd: which I must not expect from Time, but Death, which is a Truth if all things fayle of evidensing to you, my Death will not. Though shee were goeing from me yet I am confident shee heard my last words, but her disdaine (though I had armed my selfe against it) wrought so powerfull upon me, that Anexander perceiveing the disorder I was in, came to me, and attributing it to a slight wound I had receiu'd in the fight told me, that I should doe well to retire to his Lodgeings, (which were in the Palace.) I obey'd his Commands, and having tooke my leave of the King I did the like of Altezeera, but with a Countenance so appropriated to my condition, that shee being moved with it, bad me have a care of my health, which words made a great impression in me, for I could not beleeve shee was so kinde out of a desyne to Crowne my Affection with a reciprocall one, nor so cruell as to preserve me only to torment me. In this suspence I arriv'd with my Father at his Chamber, where Lindesia solemniz'd her joy for my safe returne, and after I had pay'd her that which my duty and inclination exacted from me; I begg'd leave of Anexander that I might with some Horse goe see what successe my Brother & my Friends had; as I was receaveing his Answer, Amidor, Stratolis, Evaxes, and the rest came into the Chamber, and told us, they had defeated all Celindus's Troopes, but that he himselfe had fledd, when he sawe that releife comeing to the King. My designe being so stopt, after I had receiv'd all my friends Civilities, and an order next morning to waite upon the King, to consult what was to be done for the supressing of Celindus; I retir'd into my Chamber, under pretence that a slight hurt requir'd some rest, as the best remedy; Having thus freed my selfe from all but my owne Thoughts, I went to bedd, where thinking to be alone, I found my selfe most accompany'd: There the Perfections of the faire Altezeera did so manifest themselves, that I was wholly taken up in the contemplation of them; but when I began to consider, that all those distinct Beautyes were as so many Enemyes that had desyn'd my destruction; I could not abstaine from saying, Vnfortunate Artavasdes! what envious power is it, that has made thee love so high an Excellenc that it is as great a sinn to expect the obtaining of her by Meritt, as a weaknesse to beleeve shee will be wonne without it. Dye then Artavasdes, & by one resolute action, declare the greatnesse of thy respect, and that of thy sufferings which necessitated thee to such a Cute. But alas I continv'd, that remedy is deny'd me too, so that I cannot live but in torment, nor dye but by disobedience, the first is inconsistent with my Nature & the last with my Duty. Yes thou must'st Live I continued after a short silence since Altezeera has comanded it, & who knowes but thy sufferings may raise her Compassion, & the Vastnesse of thy future Services convert it unto Love: but suddenly those pleasing thoughts vanisht, having no other Fundation, but a hope so ill grounded, that it was asmuch weaknesse to expect her affection, as it had beene a happinesse to possesse it. Whilst I was in this manner entertaining my sadd Thoughts, the day appear'd, & the Sunn found me as full of misery as it had left me in. But Anexander having receiv'd advertisement, that Celindus was drawing his Army together, to gaine that by a great force which a small one & fortune had deny'd him, came into my Chamber to give me advice of it, and to acquaint me, that Tygranes was fallen sick after Artabazus had acquainted him that he knew all his designes & severely reprov'd him for them, but that the King suspecting he counterfeicted one suffering the better to escape another, had plac't such strict and vigilant Guards about him that his desire of flying to Celindus could not be greater than the impossibility was. I seem'd to be extreamly asham'd when he came in, to be found so lazie in a Season when our Affaires made it a vice rather than a fault, though indeed I needed rest more than to have beene condemn'd for taking too-much. But lest my Father might discover somthing by my sadnesse, I conceal'd it asmuch as I could, and by talking of Tygranes condition indeavour'd to take him off from being too-intent in considering myne. As soone as I was readdy wee went to the King, who vsed me with transcendent favour and having assembled the Councell, some advis'd, considering Artabazus weakenesse and Celindus power, that it were fitt to vse him with all Civility, to graunt him his desires, and indeavour by protraction to reduce him to his duty; others were of opinion that when Princes capitulate with Rebells, they doe thereby discover their owne weakenesse, & declare that to be Feare they would have to be thought Mercy, which is a vertue that loses its value when imploy'd on those that dispute with Swords: Some said too, that if it were requisite to graunt Celindus any Conditions, 'twere fitt that it should be when he implor'd, and not when he attempted to force them: others beleiv'd, that to intend to graunt them then was to be resolv'd never to doe it, since his Army and Faction was so numerous, 'twas improbable he would be ever reduc'd to so lowe a posture, & that Armenia would be destroy'd for a Ceremony of State, by deferring to act that but a short while, which necessity would enforce us to at last: But the result of all was, That the chiefest of the Nobility and Gentry which were with the King, should immediatly goe into their owne Countryes, and with all expedition raise what Forces they could, & bring them to Thospia, a Towne of great importance, both for the bignesse, strength & Loyalty thereof; That Celindus thereby might be either persuaded or forc't to his obedience. In persuance of which Anexander was sent with all the considerablest Men in the Kingdome to raise an Army, and the Care of the Towne & the Forces of it the King committed to my Charge, which Employment I willingly attended as the meanes to be neere & serve the faire Altezeera. Anexander being dispatchd and Artabazus having sent me my Commission, I presently repaired those Fortifications that were defective, made new ones where they were needfull, sent out Parties to fetch in Provisions and Forrage, and to distroy what they could not bring away, slighted all grounds that were favourable for Approaches, & in a word forgot nothing that I thought requisite for a Seidge. I found the Number I had within were (Inhabitants and all) 14000. Foote, and 1400. Horse, which I devided into severall Troopes and Companyes, and to avoyde all Treachery, made them still drawe lotts for their Guards. But in all this Noise of Warre, the silent Fire of Love did still possesse me, & what with incessant toylings, and distemper of Minde, I so fell away, that a slowe Feaver seized on me, and doubtlesse I had yeelded to it, had not the care of preserving my Princesse given me supernaturall forces. This declination was so apparent; that Altezeera was not ignorant of it, and (as shee assur'd me afterwards) sympathiz'd with me in it, But her Spirit was greater then her Inclination, & consequently my Paine than either. But whilst things were thus in Artaxata, Celindus was not idle, and having gott advertisement that Anexander was gone to raise an Army; he resolv'd to employ His for the taking of that Towne before Anexanander was able to releive it, and in pursuance of that determination, the Tenth day after our Fight, he presented himselfe before the Walls of Artaxata with an Army of about 50000. Foote, and 10000. Horse, well fitted with all things that he wanted, only a good Quarrell. The order in which they martcht, made them as formidable as their very Numbers, and having drawne up in a Playne on the East side of Artaxata, they advaunc'd the two Wings of their Army by degrees, and environ'd the Towne, having east a Bridge of Boates over the River Araxis, which separates Artaxata by the midle, and begann by flinging up of Earth to secure themselves from our Sallyes. The King from a high Tower of the Palace perceiv'd all the motion of that great Body with a resembling Feare, which truely was one of Artabazus most predominant defects, for he was timorous to such a height; that it made his Subjects bold, But Altezeera, (who then was with him, & whose spirit was hardly capable of apprehension,) consider'd those with Indignation which her Brother look't upon with Terror, In the meane tyme I had orderd all the Souldiers to their severall Posts, and being not able to endure Celindus so neere without tasting of what composition his Army was made; I gott 1000. Horse and as many Foote in Armes, and by a furious and unexpected Sally, forc'd the next Guards to a hasty retreate, and in the disorder thereof routed some Reserve Troopes which came to oppose us; The Campe at this hot Alarum, was presently all in Armes, and sent out three Bodies of Horse, who added to our successe in steed of finishing it, & some of them that scap't our Swords told such Miracles of our Courages, to appologize for the poorenesse of their owne, that Celindus in Person at the Head of 4000. Horse, came to know and redresse his Condition. This made me thinke of retreating, not being so perfectly acquainted with my Souldiers Vallors as to beleive they might not be vanquish'd without being kill'd, and having such good successe I was loath to adventure all the Gallantry of the Garrison at one push, where the advantage if wee had successe could not be so great as the prejudice if wee had beene deni'd it. Therefore I sounded a Retreate, and as I was making it leasurly, Celindus sent 500. Horse a full gallop to ingage us, which they did, & thereby too so farre ingaged themselves, that not Fifty ever got off, but yet truely they defended themselves so well, and rallyed so often, that I was much troubl'd such gallant Men should be so ill employ'd: but their obstinacy in refusing Quarter, made us think it a Iustice to give them none. The Execution indeed was bloody, for by those that reckon'd most moderatly, in all this fight there were esteem'd neere 4000. to be kill'd, and wee lost about 300. This was our first Essay, and with this successe wee retourn'd into Artaxata before Celindus could come to the place of revenging those Deaths he had bin a sad Spectator off. Having by a short speech thanked the Souldiers and Officers & commended their Vallors, I tooke one and twenty Colours, which were the marks of our that dayes Successe, and went to the Pallace to present them to Artabazus, who having seene what we had done, (to honor us the more) came with Altezeera to the Gate, where laying them at his Feete, I told him. Sir, my fellow Souldiers & I humbly present you these markes of the goodnesse of your Quarrell, & beseech you to receive them as friuts of our Fidelity, and as an earnest of what we will hereafter pay you. To which (having first embrac'd me) he reply'd, Let not your Civility under the name of the goodnesse of my Quarrell robbe you of that Glory your Gallantry deserves, 'Tis that which presents me with these effects of it & which indeed is so great, that I know not whither I should sooner elect, to have Artavasdes or Iustice in my side, but having both I am as secure as the Gods can make me. After some Civilities the King retir'd into the Pallace, & the Princesse to her Appartment, where observeing my deepe Melancholly shee told me smyling, If I knew not perfectly your zeale to my Brothers service, I might by your sadnesse, (after having pay'd him so signall a one) suspect, your Victory was rather your Misfortune than Designe, Madam (I reply'd) if it were so, I should therein be guilty of noe Cryme, at least if it be none to immitate you, for what in raillery you say of me, I feare I may with too too much Truth say of you in a Victory which though you knew but lately, you have long since acted. The faire Altezeera blusht at what I had spoaken, which made me (apprehending her reply) not give her the leasure of making it & therefore I hastily continu'd, But Madam, if I have cause to be satisfy'd with my Fortune I am certaine I have not to be so with my Condition for though the first gave me those Ensignes, yet the Iast necessitated me to present them to another when You stood by, at whose Feete I should have prostrated them with much more Ioy then I tooke them, but alas my Condition forces me to performances against my Inclination, which yet would be somthing extenuated, if as you are convinc'd of that Truth in this Particular, you would Pardon it in an other. Altezeera by not taking notice of what I desired & feared shee would, did it in my opinion sufficiently and obligingly; But that I might make noe sinister or advantagious construction of her silence shee told me, The Victory you have so recently obtayn'd could not be more Iust, then you have beene in so bestoweing those signes of it, so that I am more oblig'd to your intention then I should have bin by your Performance, and yet in the first I discover how concern'd you are to oblige me, since rather then not doe it, you would commit an Iniustice. Would to the Gods Madam I hastily reply'd with a deepe sigh, you had the same Indulgence for me, but Madam I continu'd will you permit me some times to beleeve you speake what you doe not intend, by being now convinc'd you doe so; for you cannot be so ignorant of your owne Power & the duty I owe it, as to immagin I can owe more, or so much to any other Creature. The faire Altezeera who apprehended the continuance of this dispute might proove a Continuance of her trouble, to put a Period to it told me coldely, I see Artavasdes you must be Victorious in all you undertake, and to be conquer'd by your Civility is as unavoydable for your freinds, as to be so by your Sword is for your Enemyes. Ah Madam (I reply'd) if you see me not what you say you doe, you may when you please, and by permitting me to be Victorious over your Disdayne, you may make me Triumph over the Enemy I most apprehend, and thereby render me as uncapable of loosing, as of needing any other Victory. Whilst I was thus speaking, the faire Altezeera assum'd a Countenance so full of Severity and Majesty together, that I understood her answer before shee spoke it, though it contayn'd these cruell Words. Since Artavasdes you will force me to understand you, unlesse I would acknowledg my selfe-as insensible as I feare (by your thus Proceeding) you beleeve me, I must tell you with a playnenesse as great as yours, that the first time you speake to me of your Passion, it shalbe the last, & if you desire the Continuance of my Esteeme, you must neither sollicite my Love nor acquaint me with yours, since if you doe I shall not only revoke that, but trye if my Brother will be more succesful then I have bin, in teaching you the respect you owe, and ought to pay me. Shee had no sooner done speaking, then shee retir'd into her Closet in which shee lok't her selfe up, and left me in Confusions as great as their Cause. O Gods! what did not I say or think against my Princesse cruelty, since it even Proportion'd the vastnesse of that Passion, which was the object of it; I had longer continu'd in that fatall intertainment had not some of her women come into the Chamber, and lest they might guesse at the occasion of my sadnesse, by the visibillity of it, I forthwith went to my owne Appartment, where I spent the residue of the Day and the succeeding Night in all the Agonies and Tortures of a great and fruitlesse Passion. Many dayes I struggel'd under that Burthen to which doubtlesse I had yeelded, if Altezera's safety, and the honor of having it committed to my Sword, had not beene the most Predomminant. Celindus in the meane time assum'd a Resolution of storming Artaxata in the open Day, in a Confidence by so brauing an attempt to eface his late affront, Knowing that in all Warrs, especialy Domestick ones, the people Iudge of the Progresse by the begining, and that who ever does loose his Reputation, will soone after that loose his hopes and Army. This Intelligence was brought me by a faithfull and Intelligent Spy who came from Celindus Campe, and who had seene the Scalling-ladders, the Faggotts and the rolling-Bridges all fitted. This advertisment I instantly communicated to Artabazus, and the Councell, who were all astonisht at Celindus resolution, and beleev'd he durst not have assum'd it, were he not favour'd by some of the Garrison; the probability of which opinion made me have a care of securing all within, aswell as opposeing those without. The night before this Intended assault, not knowing whither I should out-live it, and to render my Death pleasing or necessary, I went to Altezeera's Appartment, where having begg'd, and obtain'd the honor of a Private Conference with her, after a small silence, and great Disorder I told her. I should not Madam have presum'd to appeere againe before you, to discover my repeated Disobedience, had not I faithfully indeavord to the vttermost to have avoyded it, but having found, that the Passion your Beautyes doe inspire, are not to be Cur'd but by you or Death, & that that Truth cannot be a greater one than that is, that you are resolv'd to declyne being my Restorer, I am come Madam, to Conjure you by your owne Quiett and mine, to permit me in this folowing occasion, to seeke out and imbrace a Cure your Iustice or cruelty Denies me: Did not I conclude that the Ending of my Life now would be more advantagious to you, than the Continuance of it could Proove, during the seidge and Danger, I would rather grone under my Miseries, then Ambition for them such a Period, 'Tis not much faire Altezeera, that the miserable Artavasdes Implor's, for he begg's not that you would make him happy, but that you would permitt him to be no longer Miserable, which will not only act his Cure, but your reveng also for having needed it; on which latter he is as Intent as on the former, and desires it asmuch on your score as his owne. These Words deliver'd with a looke & accent, that were very mooveing, Prov'd so with her to whom they were adrest, who with a Countenance that Told me so, Reply'd. Though I confesse your perseverance in your Passion & Disobedience does much trouble me yet I know not whither your Death would not doe it more, and till I have resolv'd that Doubt, I desire You not to doe it, & if that be not sufficient I command you it, & shall Iudge of what you would perswade me, by observing whither what I say can perswade you. If Madam (I reply'd) my sufferings were with hope, I might by my Reason raise my Fortitude to the requisite height, and therefore I doe now in some sort rejoyce at the unpromisingnesse of my Condition, that as my Flame excells all others, so the Beauty which inspires it, may abundantly finde by my Obedience, the visibility of that distinction to be as great in the effect, as in the cause. But Madam I humbly conjure you if in the Duty of preserving you, I fayle in that other of obaying you, ascribe it to the reall Cause, and give my Death that sensibility which you have deny'd my Life This is a Mercy which Compassion may obtaine if not Cloake, and though I should ambition the last, yet I dare not hope it, and implore your pardon for presuming to name it. I shall know said Altezeera hastily how to Distinguish betweene what seeks you, and what you seeke, And therfore beleeve me if I finde you guilty of the Last, I shall deny your Death not only the first of those two things you mentioned, but both. These last words shee deliver'd goeing away into her Closet, & her Eyes were so cover'd with Teares, and her Cheeks with blushes, that I knew not whither, compassion or a more obliging cause, carried her so Hastily away. As soone as I found I was alone (which I did not for a good while, so much my Doubts, my Feares, and my Hopes were Predomminant) I went to give the necessary orders for the reception of Celindus, the Certaynty of whose intended assault next morning, I had that night Confirm'd unto me by repeated Intelligences. Aurora did but begin to give the World notice of the dayes approach, when the shrill Trumpetts and other warlike Instruments, invited the Souldiers to drawe out of their Campe, and to march to the storming of Artaxata, which, if taken would end the Warre, and satisfie both their avarice and ambition Celindus to annimate his Army, made them a short speech, and therein acquainted them, That their Interests aswell as courages, invited them by one gallant Action to conclude that Warre, which tyme would render more difficult, and perhaps unfeasible. That his happinesse or misery depended upon their Swords, as well as their Reward and honor did upon his Fortune; That since the Tyes were mutuall, the hazard should be so likewise, That therefore he would be aswell a Companion with them, as a Commander over them: and would have as great a shape in the danger as the Glory, which he doubted not was as certaine as it would be great, having those whose Courages would Court Victory so handsomly, that her Injustice must be as high as their vallors, if shee did not fling her selfe into their Armes. The Souldiers encouraged by so obliging words, testified their Resolutions by a showte (which was almost as lowde as their guilt) and Celindus with the Generous Phanasder (his Lieutenant Generall) having order'd the manner of their storme. The First Troopes advanc't & discharg'd a shower of Darts upon those which I had appointed to mann the Walls, and playing without intermission upon the Batlements, they did (under favour of their shott) advance their Battering- Rams, their Rolling-bridges, and their Scaleing-ladders, which were all order'd with so much advantage, that the Rams having made a Breach, Celindus in person at the head of 4000 men presented himselfe at the Mouth of it with so assur'd a Countenance, that the dull Inhabitants and some Souldiers which had the Guard of that Quarter, fledd & left him the Passage cleere. Whilst these things were acting on the North side of Artaxata, I was disputing against Phanasder the weakest place of it, which he had assaulted with so much fury, that I attributed our Victory to the justice of the Gods, rather than to any humane meanes, and I had but newly beaten him off, when a Souldier that fledd from the Breach which the Enemy had enter'd, came running to Me and told me, That Celindus with neere halfe his Army was within our Wals. This Newes (as you may easily immagin) did not a litle surprize me, and having no leasure to exclaime against Fate that thus endanger'd Altezeera, I tooke most of those Men with whom I had defeated Phanasder, and rann with them to the place the Souldier guided me unto, where I found that Celindus had possest himselfe of that streete which lead directly from the breach unto the Palace, and was already beginning to force open the Gates of it, when I cry'd out, Hold Celindus, doe not thinke the Gods have so much abandon'd the Innocent as to permitt the King and Altezeera to fall into thy Power, the ill successe of Phanasders Forces shewes that they are under the protection of Divinity, and if that Argument will not make thee credit it, thy owne defeate shall. Finishing those words, wee thurust our selves into the thickest Squadrons, where my valiant Friends so well acted their parts, that wee soone cloathed them with our own Livery (despaire.) But I must give Celindus that due, that what Troops our Resolution disorder'd, his rally'd againe. To be breife, wee were so tir'd with our former action and this too, that wee had bin absolutely vanquish't had not Amidor come unto our Rescue, who having defeated those Assaylants that had storm'd his Quarter, & learn'd the danger I was in, came with 1000 men to my reliefe so seasonably, that it was when we fought not in hopes to avoyde being Defeated, but to avoyde deserving to be so. This supply so dishartned Celindus, that he begann to thinke of a retreate, which almost as soone was put in practice, but the Enemy were much astonish't when they heard a hideous Crye behinde them, which was occasion'd by some 500 men that Amidor had sent secretly out of a Sallyporte, who vnexpectedly falling upon those that guarded the Breach, made them flye to Celindus for safety. Wee so husbanded this disorder, that we absolutely rowted the Rebells, and the slaughter had bin much blood-dyer had not I bin the occasion of hind'ring it, for during the Fight I receiv'd some wouds, out of which rann such abundance of blood, that in following the execution, I fell downe pale & speechlesse, & suddenly the Rumor being dispers'd that I was kill'd, Amidor & all the rest were so much concern'd in my losse, that they neglected increasing Celindus'es, who in our disorder found his safety. When Amidor and the rest of my Freinds came to me, they saw me inviron'd with dead bodyes, and with as litle signe of Life as those I was amongst, yet they carry'd me to my Chamber, and lay'd me on a Bedd. The Newes of Celindus defeate, and my death, came at the same tyme to the Pallace, and as two contraries of equall strength the one destroy'd what the other rais'd, only the King & Altezeera (especially the later) seem'd to be more concern'd in my losse than in their owne safetyes. The former consider'd me as one, whose past service had render'd me considerable, and whose present condition made him thinke my helpe would have proov'd so, which were the grounds whereon he built his greife: But the latter, besides those considerations, added that of her Freindship (and perhaps affection) which drowned all the lesser ones, as the Starrs are not seene when the Sunn appeares. The first thing shee immagin'd (as shee afterwards told me) was, that the Gods had resolv'd the ruine of her Family, and as an earnest therof had taken away the cheife Supporter of it, (for that was the Title her goodnesse gave me) To the End shee submitted with much lesse reluctancy then to the Meanes, But (as her Minde was never at rest) she beleiv'd on the other side, that my death was the effect of her Cruelty & my Despaire, and then shee abjur'd all those severe Lawes, which under the name of a great distance in Blood, confines us to a much greater from Felicity. The horror which invaded all her facultyes was very great whilst shee look't upon her selfe as the Cause of my death, but it was suddenly rais'd to a higher pitch, For when shee was considering the sadnesse of her condition, she had withdrawne herselfe to a Windowe that look't into the Court, where shee had not bin long, when shee might perceive Amidor and the rest of my Freinds carrying me all pale and bloody towards my Chamber; That object having rais'd her greif to an incapassity of being rais'd higher, shee suddenly accompany'd my losse with a flood of Teares, and having fetch't two or three deepe Sighes fell into a swoond. Happy Artavasdes, that by a supposed death discover'dst that Truth, which to have bin certaine of thou would'st have purchas'd with a reall one: But rather wretched Artavasdes that thy Fate should be so different from thy desires, that whether liveing or dead, thou should'st allwayes torment the Faire Altezeera.) But the noyse which the Princesse made by her fall was the cause that some of her Servants rann to her helpe, who having employ'd all the Arts they knewe (after an hower) Recover'd her againe. In the meane tyme, whether by the motion whilst I was carrying to my Chamber, or what other Cause to ascribe it to I know not, but I was no sooner layde upon my Bedd, than I began to give some signes of Life, which Lindesia (who sate weeping by me) perceiving, began with raptures of joy to raise her hopes, and to immagin, that by the helpe of some able Chyrurgions I might be recover'd, which being sent for & come, and having search't my wounds and drest them, found they were very dangerous, yet to console my Mother, told her they were curable, & having given me some Cordialls which brought me to my selfe againe, they withdrew themselves. The first thing I ask't was, whether Altezeera was in the possession of Celindus? To which Amidor (who had not stir'd from my Bed-side answer'd me shee was not, and that wee had) obtained so entire a victory, that nothing could Cloud it but the condition I was in. I lifted up my Eyes and hands as my retribution to the Gods, & conjur'd Amidor, that his Affection to me might not endanger the Towne, the preservation of which I now wholly left to his Care, and that he would goe to Artabazus and receive his orders, & assure Altezeera that nothing but the impossibility of not waiting upon her should have diverted me from that Duty & happinesse. Amidor to satisfy me went unto the King, & told him how miraculously the Gods had restor'd me to Life, and that I had sent him to acquaint him with it, & to receive his Commands whilst my weaknesse renderd me vncapable of that Honor. Artabazus seem'd to be as much Pleas'd as Surpriz'd with this Newes, & would needs have gone & visited me, but Amidor told him, that I was but newly come to my Selfe, & that the alteration which so great an honor would necessarily produce might be prejudiciall to my health, therefore he humbly besought him to delay that high Favour 'till I were in a condition fitter to receive it. The King at last yeelded to Amidors request, & committed the charge of Artaxata to him, who immediatly, went to Altezeera's Chamber, & sent in to desire the honor of speaking to her. This Message exceedingly perplext her, for shee immagin'd he came to accuse her of being my Murtherer (for shee had not yet heard I was alive) & in a manner acknowledging her selfe guilty of it, shee knew not with what Face to entertaine him; yet at last shee sent him an admittance, knowing that the sight of her Greife, would rather make him pitty than condemn her. (But you may wonder (generous Artabbanes) continu'd Artavasdes) that Altezeera should beleive my Brother knew my Passion: to which I answer, That Amidor & I had so perfect a Freindship, that shee beleev'd I had nothing of Reserve for him, neither indeed had I. Altezeera who lay upon her Bedd, (& who had sent all her Servants out that none might be witnesse of that Freedome shee resolv'd to give her Sorrowes, & entertaine Amidor with) no sooner sawe him come, but with Eyes full of Teares shee told him, Are the Gods then Amidor so much declar'd our Enemyes, as to robb us of Artavasdes? I say our Enemyes, for the Tyes of freindship are as great as those of Blood, and as you had the honor to be ally'd unto him by the latter quality, so I had the satisfaction to possesse him in the former: alas how deere have we bought our instant safety? 'tis by a losse that nothing could augment but our outliveing it. Shee would have proceeded in this sadd and pleasing language, had not her sighes & Teares hinder'd its continuance, which speechlesse Orators so well acted their parts, that tho Amidor knew their Cause was groundlesse, yet it was impossible for him to abstaine from keeping her company; which shee perceiving forced her selfe to tell him. No no Amidor: it is I that am only guilty, and should only beare the punishment, my cruelty is the source of all our miseries, but I will take so severe a revenge upon my selfe for it, that you shall say, though I knew not how to recompence love, yet I knew how to punnish ingratitude. But Amidor who was confident that this discovery of Altezeera's affection, would be more powerfull towards my cure, than all other remedyes, thought it high tyme to disabuse her, and therefore told her, Madam, Artavasdes is too-much your Servant to leave this world without your permission, your Commands exacted that at his hands, and the Gods who knew how just it was for him not to disobey you, have restor'd him to life, but it will only last long enough to begg your leave to dye, if you are resolv'd to neglect and scorne his Passien. How! (said the Princesse starting up) does Artavasdes live? this delusion Amidor this delusion cannot last, doe not flatter me into a joy, which if not reall, will make my misery the greater, it cannot be, I sawe him dead. Madam (Amidor reply'd) would he were as certaine you would not scorne his Adoration as I am that he lives to pay you it, his happinesse would be then greater than your doubts. My happinesse said Altezeera would be as great as my Torment could I but credit what you say. Madam (said Amidor) if you suspect this Truth, your Eyes may give you that satisfaction which my words cannot, by my waiting on you to his Chamber, where your suspitions will soone vanish. I accept your offer said the Princesse abandoning her Bedd and giveing Amidor her hand to lead her thither) for I can have no quiett whilst I have any doubts. But Madam said my Brother lett me begg you, to leave all your disdaine behinde you, for the least quantity of that poyson kills all his hopes, & consequently himselfe; 'tis not now with him as at other tymes, where Rigour did appeare Iustice, his sufferings and services now stile it Ingratitude, though he gives it still the Former Name, and only expects his felicity from your goodnesse not his Condition. So high a modesty (said Altezeera) Merits an equall Reward, and I should be too-unjust should I deny it him. By this tyme they were come to my Chamber, and finding none in it but one of my Pages, Amidor Commanded him out, & opening the Courtens told me, the Princesse was come to visite me. The sight of so high a Beauty produc'd a proportion at effect, for before shee was come in, I could not turne in my Bedd, but now I did towards her, & with a firme voyce told her; at last (Madam) at last the Gods have heard my Prayers, & commiserating my condition have made my Enemyes swords more pittifull than you, they give me that Death you were pleas'd to deny me, and in so blest a way that 'tis in defending and not disobaying you, so that nothing could add unto this felicity, but that I had deser'd receiving of these Charritable wounds, till the last day of the Warre, that you might have had no further vse of my services, and that your security and my Quiet might have beene establisht at one tyme; But Madam since the Gods doe call me from you sooner, I conjure you to remember I dy'd serving you, and let that extinguish your resentments against an ambition which cannot be greater than was the impossibility of avoyding it. Alas Artavasdes (said Altezeera) thinke not of dying, the Gods who have already rais'd you from Death to Life will perfect that good worke: they are too-just to robb us of you. They would be too-cruell (Madam said I) did they restore me to my health, Your disdaine prepares me Torments so great, that Death is a comparrative happinesse unto them. But Madam, I doe begg your pardon, you commanded me not to trouble you any more with my Passion, and Ile obey you, only lett me beseech you to receave these immportunities as my last crimes, and upon that score to forgive them, for I vowe never to offend you more. Nor I (said the faire Altezeera) to receave your addresses as an offence; No, (Artavasdes) your vertue has obtai'd the victory, and I command you now to live, that I may shew you by my affection I know how to value & recompence yours. Alas Madam (I reply'd) what doe you doe? you may indeed by this Arte hinder my Death a while; but as soone as I discover I am deluded, by all that is most Sacred, I will not live a Minute: take heed faire Princesse, you may doe like a mercifull Iudge, who when the Delinquent's ripe for death, and made his Peace with heaven, by giveing him a pardon, his future Courses may be more Cryminall than his Precedent ones, & thereby make that which was intended for his good, the occasion of his greater ill. Banish those groundlesse feares (said Altezeera) for my intentions are as cleere as you perswade me your Flame is, and as a confirmation of it, I engage my selfe before Amidor, never to decline what I have promis'd. Ah Madam (I reply'd) why am not I in a condition to fling my selfe at your Feete as some expression of Ioy, which certainly cannot kill, since I am yet alive: But my Princesse, give me leave not only to call Amidor, but the Gods to witnesse, that I will never decline the Passion that I pay you, but will maintaine my Flame alive even in the Grave, for having vanquish't your disdaine, it cannot be overcome, and if ever I alter this profession make my future Punnishment equall to my present Felicity. As I had done speaking Lindesia came into the Roome, & my Princesse having commanded my love to be as silent as constant, withdrew her selfe, and left me in such Extasies of Ioy, that they had like to have made me ever vncapable of any; for all my wounds fell fresh a bleeding, and I was so taken up with my present Raptures, that had not Lindesia bin more carefull of me than I was of my selfe, I had dyed in and by them: but having discover'd that my Sheetes were all bloody, shee came running to me, and so tymely, that the least delay had render'd her care fruitlesse: but my wounds being againe bound up, they injoyned me to take my rest, as the best and easiest cure. Thus my deere Freind, you see how at last my desires were Crown'd, and little obstacle remayn'd to the perfection of my happinesse but my health, which by degree's I recover'd, and that which contributed most unto it was, the dalay visits of the faire Altezeera, whose conversation charm'd my Eares as much as her Beauty did my Eyes, and every hower discovering new perfections, I blest that suffering which had given me so high an Interest in them. My wounds which admitted of Forty dayes for their Cure did little Aflict me, because the Enemy never attempted any thing during that space against Artaxata, which was occasion'd by those wounds Celindus had receav'd in the assault; in which also he had lost so many men and so many others were render'd uselesse that whilst he was recovering, he sent Phanasder for a Recruite, & had drawne his Army some Twenty Furlongs from the Towne, contenting himselfe to block it up at so Civill a distance. But as if fortune beleiv'd it necessary that nothing should be don whilst the chiefe Actor in either side was unable to appeare, shee so order'd all things, that at the same tyme I was perfectly cur'd, Celindus was so too, & Phanasder came to the Campe with a supply of neere 10000 Horse and Foote: so considerable an addition rais'd Celindus his hopes, and being Ambitious to recover his Losses, & to imploy the fury of those new Men on some designe where the disadvantage of being repulst could not be so prejuditiall as the honor of successe would be glorious, Elected the storming againe of Artaxata, as most proportionat to his Revenge & Ambition, and having made his Cheife Officers approve of his designe, he gave order that all things should be in a readdinesse for so bold a one. But whilst Celindus was troubling himself to be Conqueror of a Towne, I was so in my Affections, and was more satisfyed in my victory, than he could have bin in his, had his Pride & designes arriv'd at their ambition'd period. O Gods! what vnimmaginable Ioy's does mutuall fires create in Love; at lest myne were so great, that whereas in other affaires the ignorace of things hinders us from describeing them, here the knowledge of them produced the same effect: in breife our passions so increase't, that we thought all conversation but our owne as troublesom as that was pleasing, & therefore studdyed how to be private without discovering that Flame which wee at least as much endeavour'd to preserve so, till a fitt opportunity were offer'd to move Artabazus to vnite our Hearts by an Hymenaeall Tye as firmely, as they were alreaddy joyn'd by Sympathy and inclination. One morning whilst the Sunn was yet but rising, I waited upon my Princesse into a Garden of pleasure, contiguous to the Pallace & adorn'd with all that Nature and Art was capable off; there the Company separating themselves to take that divertisement which was most agreeable to their Fancys, Altezeera and I by degrees left those that waited on us, and entring into an earnest discourse, wee engag'd our selves vnawares into a little Wildernesse, in the center whereof was a Spring, whose water was receav'd into a great Cisterne of Alabaster, which was held by the statue of a Nymph cutt in white Marble; There wee might perceive a Gentleman whose posture aswell as actions exprest his troubles, and though wee could not discover his Face, yet we might his Teares running downe it into the Cisterne, & in such abundance, as if the Fountaine and his Eyes strove, which should most loade the faire Nymphs Armes. Such an vnexpected accident made us desire to learne the Cause of it, and fetching a small compasse by the helpe of some Orange-Trees, wee came so neere, that without being seene wee might see and heere him; and as his Minde was exceedingly agitated, so we were not long in expectation, till we heard him fetch a deepe sigh, and then casting up his Eyes to Heaven he cry'd out. Miserable Amidor (for 'twas he indeed) shall not the Divinity which dwels upon her Face, thy Freindship, nor his engagement suppresse thy Passion? shall the highest Beauty make thee comitt a Resembing Crime? o noe: rather then interrupt so pure a Love deprive thy selfe of Life: and by a glorious Death settle their quiett, and conferr on thy selfe thyne owne. Then he paus'd a while, & suddenly strikeing his hand upon his Brest; he sigh'd, & said: o\---it cannot be---her Eyes inspire no flames which reason can extinguish: he knowes their Power is not to be resisted, and being instructed with the Cause, if he be reasonable, he cannot blame th'effect: & if he be not, he is not worthy thy feindship: but alas, thou talk'st as if he were the only obstacle, when thy owne defects will perhaps more fight against thee, than thy Fidelity unto thy Freind, or thy Mistrisse's to him. Then, weepeing a while he continued; what? shall the apprehension of ill, make thee as miserable as the reall ill? Fye (Amidor:) can a courage capable of loveing her, be capable of feare? Noe: 'tis not in thy Nature nor thy custome to apprehende, but this timorosnesse is the effect of thy treachery to thy freind, and since the Gods so punnish the thoughts of wickednesse, how much more will they the wickednesse it selfe? cast away then so criminall a Passion, or if that be impossible, at least by concealing of it, so torment thy selfe, that if before, or after thy Death they discover it, they may rather pitty than condemne thee. Having so said, he borrowed some of that water he had given the Nymph, & having washt his Eyes, that they might not betray what he resolv'd to keepe secrett, he went away, but not in a greater Trouble than he left Altezeera & I in, for wee found by his discourse, that the object of his Love was too the object of his freinds, and that his Freindship and Affection were the causes of so noble and sadd a conflict; But we could not sufficiently admire his Resolution, which wee esteem'd so generous, that wee assur'd our selves, a Reward equall to his vertue would Crowne it: and being both much concearn'd in him, wee determin'd by a Curious inspection into all his Actions to discover who they were that caus'd his disorder, but if that course did not succeed, then by acquainting him with what we knew, engage him to tell us what we were ignorant off, that we might employ our selves the better to serve him. In this designe, wee retourn'd to the Palace where we found, that many of the Inhabitants of Artaxata had petition'd Artabazus to comiserate their condition, since by their wants thy were reduced to so much misery, that if by some meanes, a Peace were not concluded with Celindus, or the Seidge rais'd, thy must yeeld to Him rather then to Famine. The perusall of this Paper, much perplex't the King, as well from the consideration of his Subjects wants, as the knowledg of their impudence, and the Feare of their Treachery: But before he made them any retourne he consulted with those about him, who were all (except Crasolis) of opinion that a mild answer should be given them, and by kind usage and assurances of a speedy remedy to all their greivances, indevour to keepe them within the limitts of their duty; But Crasolis whom wee too-apparently suspected was a freind to Celindus, represented, that under the formall humility of a petition there might be Treachery conceal'd; that the not suppressing of such insolent demands in their very birth, would authorize their groth, that lenity in such a case would appeare feare, & That would introduce Ruine: That if (on the other side) a vigorus Remedy were apply'd, it would not only extinguish the first sedition, but deterre the People from a second: & therefore he was of opinion, that some of the cheifest Contrivers of the Peticion should be instantly executed in the Court of the Palace. Thus Crasolis would have rais'd the King Enemyes within the Walls, aswell as without, that Celindus might make use of the disorder; yet he would have that passe for his courage and honesty, which indeed was his Treachery. But the moderate advice tooke place, and the people upon the Kings engagement of soone remedying their miseries, retourn'd with blessings for him, whose ruine was design'd by Crasolis in their peticioning. The Night which succeeded this day was not halfe spent, when the advanceing of Celindus his Army to Storme Artaxata the second tyme, gave us a hott Allarme, but being advertis'd of his designe, he found us prepar'd to oppose it. Perhapps he thought that darknesse would be more favourable to his Armes than Light, that his Men not seeing the danger would goe more resolutely on it, or that the enterprize would be more formidable unto us, when obscurity (the ingenderer of confusion) was ioyn'd to the horror of an Assault. But my deere Artabbanes I will not so much trespasse on your Civility as to particularize all the accidents which hapn'd in that blooddy Night; it shall suffice to tell you, that after the towne was wonn and lost three times, we at least remain'd the Possessors of it, (though it cost us much blood, & the Enemy more) but that which brought us so often into hazard, was, that Artaxata was twice sett on fire, by the treachery of those within, which requiring many hands to quench it, robb'd us of so many hands for our defence. Some Prisoners that wee tooke, acquainted us who were the Traytors, which being seiz'd upon, confest their Crime, and receiv'd the punnishment it deserv'd: there was also one of the prisoners that being upon the point of Death, and repenting his Rebellion sent to me, and to discharge his conscience assur'd me that Celindus had a friend in the Kings Councell, who gave him constant Intelligence of our proceedings, but he could not informe me of his name, yet by some circumstances I was fully satisfy'd that it was Crasolis: but the King beleiv'd him both so honest and so able, that if he had merited as well the first of those Attributes as the last, Artabazus had bin as happy as he was deceiv'd in him; But he possest the King so absolutely, that he only look't through his Eyes, and heard but with his Eares, which excesse of Favour that perfidious man husbanded to his owne not his Kings advantage. Celindus who perceiv'd that force was unsuccessfull, & that two assaults had cost him neere 7000 men, lost all hopes of takeing Artaxata by storme, and therefore began to make his Approaches, and endeavour to possesse himselfe of that by industry & Tyme which valour had deny'd him; but not wholly to rely upon the blinde Events of Warre, he design'd to attempt somthing by Treaty, and least that moderate way might appeare to his Army the effects of Feare and Despaire, he cloth'd it with a pretence of rendring us thereby the more secure, and consequently the more surprizable, or if his overtures were yeelded unto, they should bring asmuch advantage to his Party as a conquest could. This opinion carried so good an appearance with it, that he obtain'd his Armyes concurrence. But the great hazard Artaxata was in, in the two precedent assaults, & the scarcity of victualls, which now began somwhat to afflict the Inhabitants, (though not in so high a degree by much as was represented to Artabazus) gave Celindus's Partizans too-plausible a rise to renew their former requests, and to put the King in minde of his engagement of soone ending their miseries by Treaty or Force. The multitude much discontented by the length of the seidge, greedily lay'd hold of the exhortation, and came farr more numerous to the Pallace than the first tyme; the King having receiv'd their Peticion (as his custome was) assembled his Councell to give them an answer, And the faire altezeera, whose verue and birth gave her an equall Interest in the publique, was by the Kings Command at that consultation, where whilst wee were debateing of an Answer for the Peticioners, an Officer came to give me notice that a Trumpett, with a Gentleman sent from Celindus desir'd admittance, having some things of high concearnment to offer, touching a happy Peace. The King thought this a fitt occasion to deferr giveing the people an answer, and commanded them to retire, which they did, but with bitter execrations, that if they had not a speedy retourne and proportionate to their demands, they would act that which they only mention'd in their former Peticion. Crasolis omitted not to take notice of that insolent expression, but the People being gone, there arose a dispute, whether the Gentleman employ'd from Celindus should be admitted. Those that were of that opinion fortified it by representing, That the Lawes of Custome and of Nations, alow'd Princes to heare the desires of their rebellious Subjects, otherwise the Warre would never determine, but by the absolute extirpating of the offendors, where the expence of Treasure, the hazard, and the Tyme, would not be repay'd, were the victory never so perfect. That it might be Celindus would propound some conditions which would suite with his owne Interest, and the Kings too, That if his motions were not heard, the people might be possest they owed their ruine to the Kings wilfullnesse, and that they were much more humble and reasonable than perhapps they really were; that his Affirmative being not to be confuted by any apparent proofe, might passe for currant, and the Armenians thereby enraged, might runn to the last extreames, That the Propositions must be reasonable or unreasonable, if the first, then to be embrac't, if the latter, to be Iustly rejected, and by a declaration conuince the world that they were so, and finally by demonstrating the insolency of his demands, confirme Subjects in their Loyalty, and satisfie strangers with the equality of the proceeding. Those that were of a contrary Iudgment, alleadged, That the lawe of Custome in admitting Rebbells to capitulate with their Princes, was not binding in it selfe, but only as farre as aduantages might be derived from it, That Celindus his Craft and wickednesse were so great; that the first gave as litle hope of obtaineing any advantage by Treaty, as the latter of enjoying it if obtayn'd. That no miseries which could befall a King by being overcome by his Subjects, could equall the infamy of yeelding to them, since the first is an act that the Gods forces him unto, but the other a misery he throwes himselfe upon, and he is more justly to be condemn'd that makes himselfe the instrument of his owne ruine, than he who is found to be made so by a power he cannot resist, That by rejecting his demands the people will probably assure themselves that Artabazus is in a good condition, and that he has some certaineties of a speedy and sure releife, since otherwise he would not decline any overture of Agreement; That this will inuite their patience and continue their Loyalty, That the state of Affaires were not so lowe as to act those those things which necessity only can render legitimate, That to diuulge his overtures might prove ruinous, how insolent soever they were, for if they offer'd Peace upon any Termes, the people who judge of the goodnesse of the offer by the benefitt which they derive from it, will thinke their ease cannot be too-deerely purchast, & thereby make that which is design'd to engage them more vigorously in the Kings service, the way to make them all embrace Celindus's But notwithstanding these Arguments, the King inclin'd to the first opinion, and the Gentleman being admitted, he presented the King upon his knees a Letter from Celindus, and being order'd to withdraw, Artabazus open'd it, and commanding it to be read, found in it these ensueing words.  the Armenia's. the goodnesse of your disposition, so highly misledd and abused by the subtilty and wickednesse of Anexander, and with what reluctancy (having fruitlessly attempted all other meanes to free you from so lowe a subjection) I have bin necessitated to make vse of force: I conjure also the same Gods to make me the object of their fury if having your engagement for the bannishing of Anexander, and all those whome he has infested with his Principles,  & the giveing the Princesse Altezeera to Palisdes, I doe not instantly lay downe Armes & count it more glorious to returne to my first Quiett and Condition, than to possesse as many Crownes as you have Subjects; And as the former of these, is the only way to putt the affaires of this Kingdome in a right temper, so the latter is the only meanes to confirme and settle them in it, I shall therefore humbly begg you so to consider of this request, as that it may not produce a denyall; but by graunting it, remoue all the distractions of your Subjects, whose misery by the Continuance of a VVarre, must be cast upon your doore, & whose redresse shalbe the intent endeauours of CELINDVS.  King, That the requests were as unpardonable as he that made them, and that though they had not bin so, yet they might have bin more aptly offer'd before he had attempted any violence against him or Artaxata, That being made after, they were to be look't upon as the effects of his dispaire, not to that pretext he seem'd to Cloake them withall, That Anexander was the cheifest Piller that sustain'd his greatnesse, which made Celindus so earnest to remove him, thereby more securely to Ruine it, and that to sacrefice so faithfull a Servant to Celindus's ambition, was under the appearance of banishing but one man, effectually to seduce most men; who seeing vertue was ruinous, would finde sufficient motives in their nature aswell as Interest to make them declyne it; That to deterr Celindus from storming any more Artaxata, 'twould be fitt to give him advertisement that Palisdes should be exposed to all the Darts  &c Arrowes that were flung or shott at those defended it; To which last motion Amidor reply'd, That it were not only to wrong our courages, but to make Celindus beleive our condition was very lowe, when we elected for our preservation Courses that were so much so; that of he were repulst, he might perswade his men, he ow'd the Affront not to our vallours but his feares of destroying Palisdes, whereas 'twere wiser (aswell as more Generous) to purchas our security by our vertue, which would in his first attempt cutt off all his hopes of a second. This was much contraverted, but at last Crasolis made this ensueing speech. Sir, As I cannot looke upon your present condition without great horror, so I cannot without a resembling Ioy consider, that there is yet some overtures made, by which you may be preserved from ruine; for indeede 'tis a signall mercy of the Gods, that Celindus who has had so much wickednesse as to acte what he has done, should not carry on his to the vttermost, but that his Power being boundlesse, his Ambition should yet putt limmitts to it's selfe, & offer to be contented with a parte from you, when by himselfe he might possesse the whole: But Sir, as those Gentlemen which have spoaken alreddy doe well observe, wee shall pay Deere for this Peace; 'tis true, but yet, if we accept not of it, wee are like to pay deerer for a Warre. I must confesse to banish Anexander goes asmuch against my Reason as inclination, and to sacrefice so Generous a Subject to a Rebbell, is to make us hereafter embrace vice for our Interest. To give the Princesse too, unto Palisdes, is that which will render our sorrowe as great as is Celindus Ambition in demanding her, or Palisdes happinesse would be in possessing her. These Sir are the effects that will proceede from graunting his requsts, But alas what will be the Miseries that attend a refusall of them? Anexander insteed of banishment to be murther'd before your Eyes, Altezeera forc'd to be Palisdes Wife, your owne Life made an oblation for the assurance of Celindus's, your faithfull Servants expos'd to torments as great, as their Fidelity merits Recompence, and in a word, your Kingdome suffers Miseries sufficient (if rightly plac't) to punish the Crimes of those that are the Causers of them, But (Sir) as wee have seene the inconveniency's of granting his demands, through the opticke of our aversnesse to the action, so let us consider them, in their least formidable dresse. To consent then to Anexanders Banishment, if you looke upon it as in relation to your selfe, is, by being depriv'd of his conversation (it may be too but for a short while) to settle the quiet of your people, and free your selfe from an apparent ruine, If in respect of him, I knowe his generous disposition so well, that he will embrace his Retirement as his happinesse, being your Majesty and your Kingdome will derive Theirs from it. To give Altezeera to Palisdes, me thinks has nothing in it besides of so much ill, as the being forced unto it, For Palisdes person and birth are eminent, and all his Actions and Inclinations generous except this last, where his Fathers Comands and not his owne desires have made him faulty, and when Crimes doe beare the name of Duty, they are fitter to be pardon'd than condemn'd, being the effects of a noble cause, and if his highest vice be his obedience to his Father, what will then his vertues prove. The Princesse to, not being engag'd to any, may with lesse reluctancy give her Selfe to Palisdes, whose Youth is so promising, that 'tis probable shee may establish her owne Felicity by restoring that of the Armenians, & insteed of the giveing a Portion with her, you may receive a Kingdome by giveing of her, (For so I looke upon it as the state of your Affaires now stand) In a word, when I consider that wee heare not so much as hopes from Anexander: when I see Celindus with a powerfull Army under your Walls, & when I came but even now from hearing those within them (whome too you rely upon for your preservation) threaten nay sweare to deliver you up unto your Enemy's, with execrations which give me asmuch horror to relate as if they executed them, I cannot though with a saddnesse above discription but give my humble opinion that Celindus should have his request granted. Many of those that were guilty of Crasolis Crimes, & of Feare, so fortified his opinion by divers other Arguments, & by their concurrence, that I found Artabazus yeelding. Great Gods! who could then relate the severall disorders I was in? but alas they were nothing then to what they did increase unto when I read upon my Princess's Face the indignation which such Councells had raised in her; the sight of which made me addresse my selfe to the King, in a posture that did somthing speake my resentment, & tell him. Sir, That Celindus, who has had the impudence to take up Armes against you should demand the Princesse for Palisdes is not strange, but that any loyall Armenian should advise you to graunt it, is that I cannot sufficiently wonder at: the best construction I can make of those who are of that opinion is, that their Feares exceed their Iudgements (may be their honesty) Shall his Defeates be the steps to his Ambition? and shall our having given them drowne our Courages? the Gods forbidd: But Sir, allow we were as lowe as these Mens Spirits are which gave that Councell, what heavyer yoake can we groane under than that which now we would submitt unto: Shall our Feares give that to Celindus which his Courage ne're will purchase? and shall we by a preposterous apprehension, count all those Deliverances the Gods have hitherto sent us, as so many Omens of our Ruine? or else Sir, have these men seene any coldnesse in our Courages on which they build their despaire? if not; why doe they so much wrong them? What, shall Altezeera, who is a Recompence too high for Vertue, be a Sacrafice unto Rebellion? o Sir! doe not by such a recompence inuite your Subject in the future to revolt: what guilt can be so vgly that such a reward will not inuite us to embrace? let us not then by contributing unto the Crime, make our selves worthy of the Punishment; Nor let these Mens timerousnes perswade you to that, which if once acted, the Gods must never afterwards protect you, unlesse they have design'd to appeare as vniust as these would have you be to your Selfe and the Princesse, who are more thretn'd by their Feares, then our Condition. But as I was going to continue my discourse upon those subjects that related to the suppressing of the mutinous People, and my Fathers particuler, a Gentleman came in and told Artabazus, there was one which wore Celindus's Colours being well mounted, was scap't from the Campe, & though follow'd by five or six of the Enemy had recover'd the Port and begg'd earnestly to be presented to the King, alleageing that it was about affaires of high concernment, and which could admit of noe delay. Artabazus comanded forthwith that he should be brought in. The man noe sooner heard the permission (for he waited at the Dore) than he flung himselfe at the Kings Feete & told him, Sir, Anexander, after a Thousand Difficulties, which nothing could render supportable but the consideration of Him for whose sake he indured him, ha's brought an Army of 30000 men into Thospia, where a violent Feavour (enuious of his glory) has flung him into his Bedd, and though his Torments are very great, yet he resents none so fully as those which proceede from the impossibility of his serving you in person: But since his fatall sicknesse (as if all things had contributed to increase that Misfortune) there has happ'n'd so high a dispute betwixt Stratolis and Falintus, who should have the happinesse to command the Army for your Releife; that some sadd events are thereby alreddy fallen out, & howerly will be augmented unlesse Artavasdes (who they all begg for their Generall during Anexanders indisposition) be instantly sent to take the charge of the Warre, and lest your Majesty should doubt the Truth of what I now deliver, I shall humbly desire you to peruse this Ticquett, which being presented wee found 'twas sign'd and written by Anexander, and only begg'd the King to credit whatsoever he should relate. The joy wee all receiv'd at the assurance of so powerfull an Army's being readdy to releive us, did mittigate our sorrow at the hearing of Anexanders not being able to Head it. But Artabazus & the Councell (to lose no tyme) thought best to dispatch Celindus's Messenger without the honor of an Answer, which they concluded was the fittest they could returne his Ambitious Desires, & to send Me that Night away, though the wicked Crasolis oppos'd the latter, alleageing That the Towne would doubtlesly be lost, if I were once out of the Walls, that probably I might be taken or kill'd endeavouring to passe the Enemyes Guards, That then not only Artaxata but the Army would lose it's Head and cheife Defender, and therefore he was of opinion 'twere beter to send a Commission joyntly to Sratolis and Falintus to command the Army, than to expose all to so great a hazard. This advice was not given out of any affection to the publique or my prrticuler, but that he beleiv'd, by joyneing of Sratolis and Falintus, there would arise such distractions as Celindus might inioy the aduantages of them, But (as I told you) this Councell at that present tooke not place, and to omitt noe opportunity, I went to take leave of the King, & assur'd him that within fowerteene dayes I would either make him absolute Monarch againe, or by my Death evince 'twould not be the defect of my Desire but of my Power, & since the time was so short, I begg'd him to give me an assurance that he would not (before those Dayes were efflux't) admit of any Treaty with Celindus. The King having satisfy'd my request, embrac'd me very affectionatly, and conjur'd me not to faile at the tyme appointed, lest the People should force him to accept of those conditions his Reason and Inclination made him equally detest, which having faithfully promis'd, I went to my Princess's Chamber, who not being able to conceale her Greife had commanded all her Servants out of the Roome, and lay upon a Bedd, abandoning her selfe so excessiuely to Sorrow, that I surpriz'd her in the greatest hight of hers and told her. Madam, if I could admit any doubts of an ill Successe where your Safety is concern'd; so badd an Omen as your Sadnesse is would infuse them into me. To which shee answer'd, I must confesse Artavasdes, that when I consider the many Dangers you must expose your selfe unto, and the many more that you will, I find my Teares so just, that I esteeme it a Sinne to retaine them, neither can you beleive the assurances I have given you of my Affection to be as reall as indeede they are, without considering my Greife as a necessary Tribute of my Love, and not an Omen of your ill Successe. My Princesse (I reply'd) your Sadnesse could not but kill me did I not looke upon it as the Effect of so happy a Cause, but pardon me if my zeale to you be so great, that I euen condemne the demonstrations of my owne felicity, when they prove troublesome to you. Alas (said Altezeera) what would you have me doe? not to Deplore your absence, is inconsistent with my Affection, and to doe it, is prejuditiall to your contentment, but since 'tis impossible to suppresse the first, at least by a quick returne make the last cease, which can admitt of noe ease during your absence. Madam (I reply'd) the Gods shalbe my witnesse, that I will neglect noe tyme, nor shall any thing but Death hinder me above Fowerteene Dayes from comeing to Adore you at your Feete: Celindus and his Army shall feele what fury possesses me at this separation, & by their sufferings, know how dangerous it is to oppose Artavasdes, when Altezeera's safety is the quarell. But said the Princesse (interrupting me) take heede you doe not so much trust your Courage, as not to consult your Iudgement, and to mittigate that heate which may prove so fatall to us both, remember that what Artavasdes suffers Altezeera does, and as you love her Life, preserve your owne. I should be too prolix my deare Artabbanes, should I tell you all the words that sadd Farewell furnisht me with, I will therfore (to hasten a conclusion) only lett you knowe, that having Kis't my faire Princesse Hand; I tooke leave of her, and then of Amidor, to whome I left the care of Artaxata, and what I vallu'd infinitely above it, and having given a hott Alarumm to every Quarter of the Campe but that through which I past; I arriv'd in two dayes after at Thospia, where I found Anexander in much danger by the violence of his Feaver, who having commanded me to leave the care of him unto the Gods, and to imploy all mine for the Kings deliverance, I forthwith acquainted the Army with my Commission, who joyfully receiv'd me, and lest delayes might prove prejuditiall wee martched with what expedition possibly could be made towards Artaxata, and the Tenth day after my departure from thence I camped Thirty Furlongs off Celindus, upon a Hill within sight of the Beseidged, where having call'd a Councell of Warre, by their consents, I sent a Trumpett to him with this ensueing Challenge.  beleiue there are no Gods to punish wickednesse; I should dispaire of your accepting a pitch'd Battell for the ending of the VVarre, lest terrified by the divine Iustice, your guilt should weigh downe your Sword; But your Rebellion demonstrates, that you beleive noe Deity but Power, and since your Courage is the best of your Qualities, I should gladly receiue an assurance, that to saue many a Thousand Life, you would venture your owne against me in a single Combat, But whether by Battell or Duell, I leaue it to your choyce, either of which shalbe highly acceptable as an assured way to punish Celindus, by the hand of ARTAVASDES.  knowing that his Army could have noe Provisions but what they fought for, and that Artaxata had so good a Garrison, and my Forces were so numerous; that if he defeated not the one or tooke the other, he must in a short while be block't up, and then his partye which follow'd his Fortune not Him would desert him; therefore thinking my defeate would be more facile than takeing the Towne by storme, he sent me this Answere.  are as Iust, as you thinke me the Contrary. To morrow by the Sunns riseing, I shall be in the adjoyning Plaine, at the head of 50000 men, who are too-greedy of honor to suffer me by a single Combat to robb them of their share in the Glory of an entire Victory, which wilbe as certainly ours, as that you haue an Enemy of CELINDVS.  nothing but the gaining of a Battell could more satisfie my Army than the assurance of one; which being so suddenly to ensue, every one was employ'd in performing what was fitt for so considerable a day, which no sooner appear'd but both Armyes march'd out of their severall Campes, and being drawne up expected only the sign all to begin the Fight. Celindus who knew that his Fortune depended upon the gaineing or looseing of that Feild, had left noe forces to justifie the ground he had wone by Approaches, being assur'd, that if he were Conqueror, Artaxata, without the formalities of a seidg, would be one of the first fruits of his Victory; yet to delude those of the Towne, and to keepe them from sallying, he left as many Colours flying as were usually upon the Guards, with certaine Men well mounted, who had order (in case of a Sally) to runn away with them, unto their Army. A little before the Battell, Celindus made a speech to his Souldiers, and I to annimate myne told them these few words. Freinds and Companions in Armes, I speake unto you, more out of custome than neede, If I thought any thing could raise your courages above that which nature ha's, I might represent unto you the justice of the Warre, the glorious objects for whome you are now to Deside it, Your Wives, your Families, and your Liberties who all expect their settlement from your Sworde: There is somthing too, above all this which I might mention (for these must dye with you somtimes before you) 'tis Honor; which is eternall, and will make your memories pretious to Posterity, when other things wilbe forgotten and turn'd into dust. But (my Generous Freinds) I see so noble a Resolution in every one, that I will no longer detaine you from that Victory, which your Cause and Lookes assure me of. These words being finisht I advanc't with the right wing of my Horse,  & so vigourously charged the Enemyes left, that we instantly routed them, and had an Execution as bloody as their Crimes deserv'd: but Celindus who led the right Wing of his Army, wherein he had plac'd the gallantest of his Cavalrie, fell so vigorously upon Stratolis who Commanded my left, that after a small resistance (Stratolis being kill'd) Celindus made many others follow his fate, to redresse which disorder I left some few Troopes to chase the scatter'd Rebbells, & rallying the rest, rann to the rescue of my Freinds, whom Celindus on my approach forsooke, & having drawne up a second tyme, and learn't that it was I that came to fight with him; He advanced some hundre'd Paces from his Boddy, and calling me out by name told me, 'Tis now Artavasdes, that I shall satisfie both your desires, I have yeelded to a Battell at the requests of my Freinds, who would not permitt me to engrosse that Honor to my selfe, which by their vallors they were confident would be largely distributed amongst them; And now I seeke a single Combat to please my owne inclination, to demand satisfaction for Tuminius his blood, and your insolent Challenge. Wee were both so earnest to lose noe tyme, that wee spent no more in words, but began a Duell in which the Gods so favour'd the justice of my Sword, that Celindus fell by it; but those Horse which were Spectators of his Death, so resolutely endevor'd to revenge it, that it cost us deare before wee could reduce them to what their Vallors merrited, but not the Quarrell in which they employ'd them. Whilst these things were thus acting Phanasder & Falintus who commanded the Foote of both Armys had not bin idle; But Falintus who was overpower'd, after a vertuous resistance, was taken by Phanasder, who to shelter him from the fury of his Souldeirs had cover'd him with his owne Body, and receiv'd some wounds that were dissign'd for his Prisoner. Evaxes after Falintus misfortune still disputed the Victory, though his resistance proceeded more from his resolution than his numbers, which were so diminish'd, that he was just upon the point of being conquer'd, when a Body of aboute 1400 Horse and 4000 Foote Sallyed out of Artaxata, and fell so opportunely on the Enemy, that it restor'd the Courage of our fainting Freinds. Gods! what prodigies of Vallor did I see their Leader act, He peirc't the thickest Squadrons like Lightning, and in a word so chang'd the face of affaires, that Phanasder, from conquering, began to defende himselfe; to effect which, he had gotten neere 8000 of those who had most resolution, & having cast them into a square Boddy, resolv'd to sell his Life so dearely, that the Purchasers should repent the bargaine. In this posture stood Affaires when I came from defeating Celindus with 9000 Horse, and all the Foote I could possibly rally: I confesse, it pittied me to see soe many Armenians expos'd to Death whose courages deserv'd a Fortune as good, as the condition they were then in was the contrary. I therefore Commanded all the souldiers of my Army to drawe off, that I might endeavour to save their Countrymen. So pleaseing an Injunction obtaindd a reddy obedience, and advaunceing neere enough to be heard, I represented to them, that the care I had to make my victory as little stain'd with blood, as the necessity of it would permit, made me offer them in Artabazus name a generall Pardon, so they would lay downe Armes and Ingage by their future loyalty to efface their present want of it. They all answer'd me that they had vowed their Lives and Fortunes to Phanasder, and what he thought good, they would submitt unto, I then desir'd to speake with him, which he no sooner vnderstood, than he came out unto me, all hiddeous with blood and ask't me what it was I would have. I told him 'twas his & the safety of those few the sword had spar'd, That he had peactice't so much Gallantry to Falintus that it mademe earnest to preserve the Possessor of it, & That the condition he was in was so unfit for resistance, that the acting of his distruction was easyer than the desire of it. I am said Phanasder (interrupting me) as much above your Power as your Threatning, for the Gods which have bin so cruell, have yet left me a heart to desire Death, & a sword to act it: for that which I have done to Falintus, 'twas the selfe same honor guided me unto it, which makes me hate to owe my Life unto my Enemy. How willingly (said I) would I change that name and be esteem'd your freind, to purchase it I will confesse Fortune & your want of it reduc'd you to what you are, I will engage my selfe to obtaine for you, and those under you an act of oblivion from the King, and I will only begg that you'l conferr your Frendship on me, which I will value at a higher rate than all the other Glory I shall derive from this dayes successe. 'Tis a strange thing, how much Civility workes on a generous Minde; what the advantage I had over him, nor the feare of Death could act my Kindenesse did, which prov'd so prevalent that flinging away his Sword, he came to me, and embraceing me said, 'Tis now indeede Artavasdes, that I am vanquisht, Your goodnesse makes me confesse, that which your Sword nor all the World desides could have perswaded me to. I should be now as vnjust as you are Generous, did I not with joy embrace a Freindship, which I will ever valve above all things, but my honor. After a Thowsand embraces & assurances of an eternall Freindship, Phanasder ledd me to the reliques of his Army, & commanded them to fling their Armes downe at my Feete to whome he said they owed their Lives, and many other expressions of a quallity too-tedious to be related. Things being brought to this happy period, I left my Army in the Feild in which they had gained so much glory, and takeing Phanasder & some Twenty of my intimatest Freinds, I gallop't to Artaxata, to give Altezeera & the King an accomp't of our successe, & to receive their Orders; when wee came to the Gates I found them shutt, & having told the Guards who I was, they instantly admitted Me, & inform'd me, the King and the Princesse were Sacrificeing for the Armyes successe: I went directly thither, & lighting at the Dore, all Arm'd & sprinkl'd with blood, gave so hot an Allarumm to the People, that they began with hideous cryes to flye out of the Temple, immagining we were Celindus Souldiers, who having gott the Battell were come to seize upon the King, & that which more confirm'd them in their feares, was the sight of Phanasder, whose Face (by the losse of his Helmet) was vncouer'd, & the great shoutes those of the Garrison made, when they were inform'd by some that came along with me of our victory. Artabazus all the while I was comeing towards him was mouelesteas a Statue, but the faire Altezeera no sooner sawe me tread upon the first stepps of the Alter, but drawing forth a Ponyard, which shee had conceal'd for a last remedy was lifting up her hand to have plung'd it into her Brest: but observing her designe, I prevented it by seizing that cruell weapon, & pulling off my Helmet; Gods! what a sudden alteration did that action cause? it was so great, that the King, Altezeera &, all the Company, hearing at the same time of Celindus his defeate, and Death, did not then relish that happinesse with so high a contentment, as they said it deserv'd. But at last their joy having dissipated those Clouds which Feare had ingender'd, their contentment was proportionat to the Change. Artabazus gave me all the Testimonies of his favor he was capable of, but Altezeera, did in such obliging tearmes expresse her contentmen & Affection, thar I was ravisht in the contemplation of both. But after I had given the King and my Faire Princesse an Accompt of our successe, I presented Phanasder unto Artabazus, and having acquainted him with my engagements, and magnified his Gallantry, I not only obtained what I had promis'd to him and his, but also Celindus his government for him. That which made me so intent on Phanasder's advantage, was the high opinion I had conceived of him, & the confidence I had that it was grounded on a proportionat Iustice. But amongst all those Freinds which came to congratulate my Victory, I mist my deare Amidor, and inquiring the cause of it, I learn'd that the Forces which had Sallyed out of the Towne were under his Commande, that 'twas he had done such miracles, and that probably having follow'd the execution somewhat vigorously, he was not retourn'd to the Campe before my departure from it. I rested satisfyed therewith and receiv'd the Kings orders to quarter about Artxaata, 'till he sawe whether those Townes which had declared for Celindus, would returne to their Loyalty without being forced unto it: And least any disorder might hapen in the Army by my absence, I was goeing thither, when (alas) I mett my poore Brother mortally wounded, carying unto his Lodging: so sad an object soone clouded all my Ioy, and made me retourne with him to knowe what I might expect of his fate. The ablest Chirurgeons being sent for, searched his wounds and found they were incurable for their Art. But the Generous Amidor perceiving by their Lookes our Feares, seem'd to be as full of satisfaction, as we were really the contrary, & havinge conjur'd the Chirurgeons to deale cleerely with him, whither there were any likelyhood of recovery, he receiu'd from them a sadd negative. Then turning towards Lindesia, (who abandon'd her selfe to an excessive Greife) he begg'd her not to be more afflicted for his Death, than he was for to dye, That it being a Tribute human nature was to pay, he was happy that it was in so good and glorious a Cause. Then desiring all those that were in the Roome to leave it, except Altezeera (who was come to visit him) and I, he adrest himselfe to us with an Accent capable to inspire pitty into a Fury & told us. Since my owne weakenesse aswell as the Chyrurgions Iudgements assure me I must dye, I have beggd this opportunity to reveale a secrett to you both, which no Torment should have made me disclose, & which I am confident my Actions never did. Know then, to silence your sorrow, that these mortall wounds are the effects of my desire, & not of my ill Fortune, for it was necessary for your quiett aswell as myne, that I should receive them, since I could not resist the inevitable charmes of Altezeeras Beauty: start not Artavasdes, for by that tyme I have finish't my discourse you shall have more cause to pitty than condemn me: The highest Powers shall beare me witnesse how much I did resist this criminall passion, how it forc'd not found an admittance and when 'twas gotten in, how I purchast it's silence by my Torments; yet at last finding it would be conqueror, I resolv'd to end my payne by Death, which I sought so many severall wayes that it must have bin vnjust, had I not found it out. You Weepe faire Princesse, is it for sorrow, that by dying I shall be so soone freed from those sufferings my Crime deserves? The compassionat Altezeera, who all this while did melt away in Teares preceiveing he was silent in expectation of her Answer told him, Alas Amidor, what actions have I ever committed that you should Iudge me guilty of so high a Cruelty? 'Twere more charitable aswell as just to attribute these demonstrations of my Greife unto my Pitty for your condition which so abundantly deserves it. Why them Madam (reply'd Amidor) you can pitty me, after the knowledg of my fault? Great Gods! to what misery doe you reduce me, thus to conuert that which should be my greatest joy into my gratest Toment, and thereby render any Satisfaction at my Death as impossible, as I doe ill deserve it; since not to receive her Pardon, makes my Death as full of horrors as the Cause of it is of Beautyes; and to obtaine it, makes my Crime as great, as the perfection against which I have committed it. Ah Madam drye up those pretious dropps, or else shedd them to wash away my guilt, for certainly they are powerfull enough to performe whatsoever you employ them for; And you my deare Brother, (addressing himselfe to me) can you have so much goodnesse to forgive your Ryvall, when 'twas not in his power to avoyde that fatall Name? Looke upon those bright Eyes which certainly will at the same tyme that they acquaint you with my Fault, acquaint you with the necessity of it, and obtaine your Pardon for it. You that know so well their influence must withall, rather pitty than condemne my submission to it. But I finde Death seizing on me, Farewell happy Lovers, may Ioyes, such as Raptures never reach't, waite on your Flames, may every thing contribute to make you as contentted as I shall dye having obtained your forgivenesse, which I begg with Teares, and if they finde you inexorable, I will with blood--- Alas Amidor (I cry'd out) would it were as absolutely in my power to recover as 'tis in my will to forgive thee. Ah (said amidor) talke not of recovery, I would rather be my owne Executioner, than by liveing interrupt so pure a Passion; once againe farewell, my summons is so short I shall have only tyme to begg you never to thinke upon Amidor cloath'd in his ambitous desires of possessing so divine a Beauty, nor with his vnauoydable infidellity to his Frend & Brother, But when you consider him, let it be in his pennance for his Crymes, and let that voluntary Death he ha's so resolutely expos'd himselfe unto, obtaine that mercy for him which he implores with his last Breath; and so indeed it was, for having with one hand taken the Princesses and Kisst it, and with the other embrac'd me, his faire soule fledd away, and left its noble Dwelling in our Armes. Who can repeate the sadd words so great a Losse extorted from us, which really we found of such a quallity that we dispair'd to finde a Cure even from Time. The King, and all those that were not Enemyes to vertue, did manifest a resembling sorrow, for his Youth was as promising as it was vnfortunate. (Here (said Artabbanes to Callimmachus) Artavasdes could not refraine shedding some Teares, and perceiveing I tooke notice of it; he begg'd my Pardon for so just an effeminacy, & then hasten'd to a coclusion in these words. Phanasder who did now without reserve embrace the Kings Interest, was so prevalent with the revolted Townes, that Armauria, Artemita, and Tygranocerta it selfe, came upon their Knees, and yeelded up their Keyes & Lives to the Kings Mercy, and in a word all the upper Armenia from Niphates did the like. But in the lower Armenia, Zenaxtus (a Brother of Celindus's) kept entire the Provinces of Ærethica and Horzen, and the Townes of Satala, & Nicapolis, who for all Artabazus threatnings and promises, would not lay downe Armes, but was preparing a vaste Army to revenge his Brothers Death, and to act his Brothers Ambition: which to effect he sent to Arsaces to inuade the higher Armenia, and assur'd him of a considerable parties appearing for him as soone as he should passe the Ryuer Tygris, and offer'd him all the upper Armenia for his share, so that he might have the lower for his owne, which neverthelesse he would doe homage for. You know my deare Frend, that this overture was so listned unto By your King, that instantly he rais'd that great Army which defeated ours, more by your valour than by those that follow'd you. Artabazus had some intelligence of Arsaces intentions, and to prevent them thought fitt to raise an Army, and carry the Warre into your Country to keepe his owne quiett, at least the upper parte of Armenia, & having given the Comande of a numerous one to Anexander, who was perfectly recover'd, & order'd him to suppresse Zenaxtus, he lay'd feidge to Myramnes, where you came to raise it, and where I had the Honor to become your Prisoner, which should be as pleasing to me as my liberty, did not my Passion for Altezeera, make all things that banisht me from her insupportable. Thus the Gallant Artavasdes finisht his story & gave me by it asmuch reason as I had formerly inclination to love him. After some few expressions of my esteeme both of his Passion and Vertue, I tolde him, 'Tis with much difficulty, (generous Prince) that I condemne the cruelty of my King, being it furnishe's me with an occasion to serve you, Neither cann you doubt, but I am more a freind to your satisfaction that my owne, when I deprive my selfe of so great a blessing as your company, to restore you to the faire Altezeera's. Your Civility (reply'd Artavasdes) is so obligeing, that I must thinke any thing a misery that forces me from being neere the Possessor of it: and doe therfore as much resent Arsaces injustice out of that consideration, as comend my good Fortune for makeing it the meanes of sending me to my Princesse. After a Million of inviolable Vowes of Frendshipp, Rysolis came in, to whose immediate care I recommended Artavasdes, who I will now leave returning to his happinesse, and continue the relation of what Divested me of mine. The good Callimmachus, was so earnest in his attention, that he would not so much as by one word give him the least interruption: which Artabbanes perceveing, he proceeded in the history of his owne Life in these tearmes. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PARTE THE THIRD BOOKE. capable of accession but by being incapable of Diminution; but alas all those Morning glories, were soone Clouded. For Parthenissa was so perfect, that whereas in other Women Fancy is the rule for Beauty, in her Iudgement was;  & where there was Eyes to see her, there was a Heart to adore her. In the beginning of my Fortunes I acquainted you with a Prince of the Parthians called Surena, whose Person, extraction, and Parts render'd him very considerable. This Gentleman one day sawe the faire Parthenissa, and consequently fell in loue with her (for that was an vnsever'd effect of seeing her) and as all things naturally desire their satisfaction, and preservation, so the wound which those faire Eyes had made (though vnuoluntarily) was too-dangerous to delay the Cure; he found after a long debate that the fire was too-pleasing to be quench't, that the end was so inuiting, the way could not be the contrary, although none could heale the wound, but shee that made it; & to say Truth, my Ryvall had too-violent a flame to conceale it longe, and thought it was to be vnjust unto himselfe to languish without acquainting the Author of his Torments with them, who perhapps might be as willing to ease him, as he was apprehensive of the contrary. This Resolution once assum'd he conueyes a Letter one Euening into Parthenissa's Night cloathes (but by what Art I could not the immagin) presuposing shee would perceive it there, and so out of curiosity read it. That which made Surena hasten this essay, was, that the next Morning Lindadory being to Hunt a wild Bore to sacrifice it to Ceres as an Annuall Duty, and having learn'd Parthenissa would accompany her, he immagin'd, that during the Chase he might discover what effect his Letter had produc'd; for not having the happinesse to be knowne to her, he could take no just pretence to be inform'd of it at her owne House. The morning destin'd for hunting being come, & shee intending to honor my Sister with her Company, I went to waite upon her to Court, and comeing something early, I found her not Drest; it happen'd too, that when I came in, Zianthe that waited on Parthenissa, and who was the only confident in our Amours, was gone out about some occasion, and my Princesse vncouering her Night Linnen, I perceiv'd Surena's Letter, but not knowing what it was, I told her (laughing), I see Madam, you have a Servant besides Artabbanes that dare declare he adores you, for by the place you thinke fitt to give that Paper, I cannot but immagin 'tis sent from some body that has a Passion for you. Parthenisia, who thought it had bin some Verses I had made, and hidden there purposely, told me, smyling, I renounce all Servants but Artabbanes, and to show you I am reall in what I say, I give you leave to vnseale the letter, and conjure you to reade it alowde. And I, conceiving it had bin somwhat of Raillery, open'd it, and read these ensueing words.  tooke this confidence of declaring them, you would rather admire at so long a silence, that condemne me now for breaking it: neither would I have euer disclos'd my Flame, but have dy'd silently admiring you; had I not thought this Letter a lesser Crime, than by an vnlicenc't Death to haue depriu'd you of your passionatest Seruant. But Madam, my repriue is but short, for if you now reiect the faithfullest heart that ever Loue did yet inspire, I shall receiue it as your Commands to decline adoreing you, which since I cannot whilst I liue, I am resolu'd by Death to obey you, which I shall embrace with Ioy, if it can produce any in the Faire Parthenissa.  O Gods! if Thunder had fallen at my Feete my amazement had bin farre short of what it was at the ending of this Letter, and if silence had bin a signe of guilt, I might have thought Parthenissa capable of it: For my parte I knew not what to say, to suspect her constancy was a Crime too-great to enter into my Thoughts, and how that Letter was brought in the place I found it, I could as little immagine, but least my silence might breed in her a sinister opinion of my beleife, I told her, Madam I hope this experiment will Make you acknowledge, that my saying I had as many Ryvalls as beholders of you, was rather a Truth than any thing else. I must confesse shee answer'd I had rather beleev'd you, than have had this witnesse brought to conuince me; but that Truth cannot be greater than my admiration how this Letter came hither, vnlesse for your divertion you write it your selfe, and fix't a Name to it which I beleeve as little dreames of Love for me, as I doe to conferr mine on him:  & therfore I beseech you Artabbanes, ridd me of the trouble I am in, by telling me the Truth: Madam, (I reply'd) By the respect I owe you, I neither writt the letter nor ever sawe it 'till now, but I doe knowe the hand to be Surena's. Vpon this assurance, I saw her putt on a more serious Countenance, and having continu'd silent a while, shee told me, I was 'till now confident Artabbanes that you should neede noe other way to reade my heart, than by my actions: but now I feare, to continue me in your good opinion, I must make vse of Vowes, and consequently owe that to your goodnesse, which I assur'd my selfe alwayes to obtaine from your Iustice. Therfore I sweare, by all that is most holy, and by our endlesse Passions, I never knew that Surena Lov'd me, nor can fancy how this Letter came to my hands; besides these protestations, you may immagin, if I had had the perfidious designe of receiving any addresses but yours, I would never have disclos'd it my selfe. I had not the patience to heare her further, and begging her pardon for it, I reply'd, Ah Madam, what doe you meane, you could not vse me thus, but by esteemeing me guilty of beleeveing you Inconstant, for the punishmt you now impose on me, is too-great for any other Cryme; when you would raise my Faith to credit any thing you speake, if you make vse of Vowes, or immagin there can be a higher reason to induce my beleife than your commanding it, you doe me as great an injury as I should doe your vertue, or my owne felicity, could I thinke you capable of change; neither can I be more certaine that your Eyes conquer whosoever they looke upon, then I am that your generous Minde despises every victory, but that over the too too happy Artabbanes. Truely (said shee) if there be an obligation in doeing justice, I have now receiv'd one from you, & must increase the score by beseeching your advice how to suppresse this groweing flame, with such secrecy that none may know it liv'd, but wee that know 'tis dead; for if I doe not answer him he may feede himselfe with hope; and if I doe, I then acquaint him that I know his Passion, & though my returne be never so cold, he may impute it to a wronge cause, and so that which wee elect for the Extinction of his Passion may prove the nouriture. As I was about to answer her Zianthe came in, of whome Parthenissa ask'd very strickly how that letter came where 'twas found, who seem'd to wonder at the accident, asmuch as we, and upon hir assurance of endeavouring to discover the Actor, wee gave over any further enquiry of it, & apply'd our selves how to remedy the business; & to ease the faire Parthenissa of it; I undertooke so to Mannage this new love as I would free her from any future trouble by it. Zianthe who Immagin'd I would elect that course which all Ryvalls use, to ridd themselves of their competitors, presently told her softly, that shee foresawe I would decide this difference by a Duell; which could not but be fatall to her, which soever way Fortune inclin'd; For if Artabbanes prov'd victorious, the strict inhibitions the King had so often reitterated against Duells (though it were his owne sonn that fought them) & the powerfull prosecution of Surenas Frends, will if he escape not the hands of Iustice, assuredly bring his head upon the scaffold, or if he doe, then a perpetuall Banishment will inevitably follow, & you must not expect, that his being the first Prince of the Blood, will be any Title to hope for a sparing of his; on the other side, if Surena's Sworde proove victorious, you cannot any way fancy the greatnesse of your greife, but by comparing it to that of your Losse, & which soever way the chance does fall, you must come uppon the stage, and then you are at the mercy of any that will blemish your Reputation, which though vnjustly taxed, is of so pure a Tincture, the staine will never be eface't. These Reason of Zianthe's & many others of the like quallity were so prevalent with Parthenissa, that shee came to me, and conjur'd me, by the strictest Tyes shee could inuent, not to take any notice to Surena of his Letter, which if I did, shee would esteeme it as an Argument I suspected her constancy needed my helpe, and shee ambition'd I should Derive the entire possession of her Affection only from her, and not from my Sword. Besides shee continued what greater punishment can you inflict upon your Ryvall, than to see him denied what you so absolutely possesse; and if his perseverance be greate, my Rygour shall not be inferior to it, which will render him an object fitter for your pitty than your hatred. Many other Reasons shee alleag'd, & after all shee would not quitt her Chamber, 'till I had faithfully promis'd to obey her. Immediatly after we went to prosecute our intended sport. That Day Surena seem'd to accompany the Prince Phraates, but it was indeede to waite an occasion to knowe what effect his Letter had produc'd. The assurance I had in Parthenissa's vertue and Affection, made me further all I could my Ryvalls designe, that shee might finde my confidence was more in her than in myselfe. But I easily sawe, that Surena did not more endeavour to meete her, than shee to avoyde him, yet at last in a narrow Lane, where 'twas impossible to doe so any longer, I sawe him fall into discourse with her, but being at too-great a distance, I could not heare it, yet I perceiv'd by some Passionate gestures, he was very earnest in what he said, but after a quarter of an howers tyme, the Company parted them, and I easily read in his lookes his successe: The Sunn by his declining warn'd the hunters to retire, and Parthenissa accompanying my Sister to her Lodgings begg'd her that wee might be private, & then having acquainted her with my Ryvalls Letter, shee told me, You remember Artabbanes the long narrow Lane wee ridd through, it was there where Surena overtooke me, and if he deriv'd any pleasure from his entertainment, he owed it not to my inclination but my necessity. After a few indifferent discourses he told me with some disorder, I perceive Madam, by your shunning me, that my Letter which declar'd my Passion is fallen into your handes, and I now finde my apprehensions were not vnjustly grounded Sir, (said I) I must confesse this morning I found a Letter in my Chamber which I burnt if it were as you say a declaration of your Passion I would that were also reduc'd to that nothing the paper is. Ah, Madam (he reply'd) can you be so resembling to the Gods in Beauty, and not in disposition? for they are never offended with a Heart which does adore them with that Devotion which myne does you: if it be a Cryme for me to Love you, then it is sinn for you to be so lovely: and if my Flame be an offence, you must quarrell with your perfections which ore the causes of it. If your Passion (I reply'd) be so great as you say it is, I must then beleeue your immagination, not your Iudgment attributes those perfections to me which ha's rais'd it, for Beauty being but Fancy, you may persuade those which otherwise will take your choyce that you perceive as many perfections in me as I know I want, but least your affection may prove a deceiptfull opticke, my Charity shall putt you in the right way, which is to decline your addresses to me for besides my great want of Meritt, I am as rigid as the perfectest of my Sexe, therefore I beseech you, owe this Cure to your Reason and not to Tyme. Madam (he answer'd) 'tis Reason gave the wound, and neither Tyme nor your Disdaine shall ever make me alter the resolution I have so justly assum'd, you may as easily hope to separate Light from the Sunn, as my heart from that Passion which possesses it, no faire Parthenissa, I am resolv'd, if I cannot be Loves favourite I will be his Martyr, and if your scorne cannot extinguish my desires, the coldnesse of the Grave shall never tryumph over them, but the Gods will preserve so pure a flame alive, to be a patterne for future Lovers to immitate. Sir (said I) so much Affection deserues all that I cann returne, which is my Freindship, and That againe conjures you not to cast away so noble a Passion on one that must be necessarily ungratefull, for that which you desire I have given to another, & were it in my power to recall it, it is not in my will. I hope this will shew you with how much justice I intreate you not to engage your selfe in so ruinous a designe, for should I now conferr on you my Love, & you receive it, your in discretion will be as great as you would perswade me your Passion is, for my inconstancy (the cause of your contentment) would be alwayes the occasion of your Feare. Ah Madam (he reply'd) would to the Gods you were but yet pleas'd to blesse me with your Affection, for then the joy would be so absolute, that I should only have the power to contemplat it, and not how I came to the fruition of it, But Madam, I am too-bold to hope for any pleaseing answer 'till my services assure the vastnesse of my Passion, I blesse this hower which gave me opportunity tell to you of it, and that your Rigour cannot be greater than my perseverance. Thereupon (without staying for an answer) he went away, But I impute those words (shee continv'd) to the first flame of Love, which comonly is the most violent: For my parte, I am resolv'd to were so much coldnesse on those actions which relate to him, that if he has that spirit men beleeve, I am confident 'twill change his Love into resentment. Madam (my Sister reply'd) I foresee many sadd accidents will oppose your Loves if by a speedy overture unto your freinds you doe not consumate a Nuptiall: what should divert you from that election? your Flames are too-vertuous & too-just not to be owned, & being so, who will oppose them; this delaration will silence all Ryvalls growing Loves, & make your happinesse as sure as 'twilbe great. Ah Sister (I answer'd) 'tis true, our Passions are so pure they know not a comparison But yet my Father (whose commands I receiv'd last Night) will, I am fearfull, resist this vast felicity, for as soone as I had left you, he sent for me to waite on him, which I did, and after he had walk'd two or three turnes without speaking one word, he at last told me: Artabbanes, The Gods having given me the blessing of a Sonn, I have found so high a one in it, that I shall enjoyne you to endeavour to partake of the like contentment; I should thinke my Death as full of contentment as my Life has bin of honor, could I see you match't in a Family that might assure me you should have a successor worthy of ours: To effect this ha's bin long my care, and never till now could I accomplish it: it is but lately I had a motion made me which I much approve, 'tis the Princesse Zephalinda (Surenas Sister) whose vertues, Beauty, Person and Blood, asures me you will thinke your selfe highly Satisfy'd with such a Marriadge at least I shalbe. I must confesse this declaration did infinitly surprize me, but lest he should gesse the true cause of my astonishment, I told him: In the first place Sir, as I cannot but retourne my humble Thankes for your care, so I must not but acquaint you, that I am not ignorant of how high a concernment Marriage is, being happinesse or Misery 'till Death dissolues the knott, and since felicity is only oppinion, there is none can prescribe positive Rules for the making it, but every man must be his owne Iudge, contentment something resembling Mens taste's that which is pleasing unto one, to another may be poyson, The consequence being so great, and the choyce not to be made by a Proxie, I shall beseech you give me leave to learne whether that Princesse be Possessor of such Perfectios as may assure me of my happinesse: this nothing but Tyme can doe, & if shee appeares not such to me as shee does to you I will then acquaint you with it, and hope you will not compell me to make her & my selfe miserable. As I am (said he Artabbanes) indulgent to you, soe I expect that you be obedient to me, And then he withdrew himselfe into his Closet. This was the substance of his proposall & my returne to it, for I did not hold it fitt to acquaint him with my Passion 'till first we had aduis'd together: for I perceiv'd by his last words how his inclination stood, and I too-well know how difficult he is to be remov'd when he has once taken up a resolution not to be so. Then I besought Parthenissa to honor me with her advice, since I had put all that was deere unto me, to her ordering. To which shee told me, Moneses humour (which I am absolutely ignorant of) being the Cheife thing in this Affaire by which wee are to be guided, makes me as unfitt to advise, as your knowledge of it renders you most capable. Madam, (I reply'd) That my Father is resolved to be obey'd is not more certaine, than that I am determin'd the contrary, for in this case obedience is a Crime, so that the End being now resolv'd, we have nothing to advise upon but the Meanes that may best conduce unto it. Which in my opinion Madam (said Lindadory) is, that Artabbanes make some seemeing addresses to Zephalinda (for Moneses is sooner vanquish'd by yeelding than resistance) and doubtlesse shee cannot be so perfect (especially being copar'd with the faire Parthenissa) but he may finde some defect in her person or humour, which may make his declineing her appeare an effect of his Iudgement not disobedience: for if my Father findes his refusall of serveing her, proceeds from his being possest whith a Passion for another, he will impute my Brothers deserting Zephalinda to his Preingagement, and then I am so well acquainted with his disposition, that it will be impossible to alter it. Thus by concealeing your Flames a little longer, you may attaine that happinesse which by a speedy declareing of them, may receive many obstructions if not an absolute ruine. Madam (said Parthenissa to Lindadory) I much apprehend if Artabbanes can have noe other inducements to obtaine Moneses permission of declineing Zephalinda and makeing his addresses to me, than her imperfections and my having none; that the Argument may justly be reverted by your Father, who may more aptly apply that to Zephalinda, which your goodnesse conferrs on me. My Princesse (I reply'd) there could no greater joy befall me than that Moneses were to consider both with the Eyes of Iustice, & that I were to possesse his election, you would then quickly finde how injurious to your selfe your modesty has bin, and how vast a felicity his judgement would conferr on me. I have (said, Parthenissa) so good an opinion of yours that I will bannish those apprehensions the knowledge of my owne defects doe raise in me, and they being supprest I have nothing to say against the faire Lindadoryes advice. 'Tis not enough (I reply'd) that you have nothing to say against it, But if you will have it observ'd (Madam) you must strictly enjoyne it me, for I have so great a reluctancy to the action, that it must be some such powerfull charme as your Commands which can make me undertake it. Since (reply'd Parthenissa) the performance is so necessary, and that you assure me the only meanes that must enable you to doe it, is my Commands, I doe enjoyne you it, but my Affection makes me (I feare) vncharitable to Zephalinda, by wishing, you may quickly finde as many defects in her, as I desire perfections to merit your esteeme. Madam (I reply'd) the first of your Wishes is as vnnecessary as the last, for when Zephalinda is to be paralel'd to you it wilbe as Difficult to finde no Imperfections in her, as to finde any in you. Having taken this resolution, I began to apply my selfe to put it in practice, & that which gave me some probability of its successe was, that Zephalinda had asmuch aversion to Love, as Beauty to create it. The first addresses I made her, were receiv'd with a coldnesse proportionat to her practice and my desires, But I must confesse I contributed as much as I could to it, and apprehended nothing so much, as that which most men in Parthia would have esteem'd their highest felicity. I know not whether that which I intended as the meanes to want her Affection procur'd it, for I have bin told, that some women, where they finde but an indifferency make it their designe to bring it to an extreame, and so mens coldnesse does often ingender their Flame: But whatsoever was the cause, I begann too soone to perceive that which I so much fear'd: & knowing now shee once honor'd me with her Affection, it would be difficult if not impossible any longer to conceale mine. I resolv'd forthwith to acquaint Parthenissa with it, who I found exceedingly satisfyed with the ingenuity of my proceeding, and by the greatnesse of her contentment for an action shee could but in justice expect, I somewhat beleev'd shee had a diffidence, whether that which was begunn as a pretence were not turn'd into a reallity; having once taken up this oppinion, I cast out some words which might give her a rise to conceive it, and shee who had as peirceing an inspection as any Creature was capable of, soone conceiv'd my suspitions, and as readily acknowleg'd the justice of them, but with words so aptly appropriated to her designe, that shee made that litle jealousie the highest obligation shee could place on me, as proceeding from a proportion at Passion: and to say truth Zephalinda was capable of shakeing a Constancy lesse firme than mine, for besides her Beauty, which was fitter for wonder than description, shee had a freenesse and a grace in all her actions, peculiar to her selfe, and surpast by none but Parthenissa, her Witt and Vertue were resembling unto all her other qualities, & (in a word) shee enjoy'd so many perfections, that had not I bin prepossest with a former Passion, I had esteem'd hers as great a happinesse as I then thought it a misfortune. But perceiveing by Parthenissa's words, that shee had contracted some litle diffidence of me, and knowing that where there is once a jealousy every thing contributes to the growth of it; I told her Madam, since I finde, that there may be an ill construction made of that which I undertooke but by your commands; I am resolv'd with your permission (which I humbly begg) to take away all occasion of such a misfortune, for being innocent I would not looke Like guilty. The way Madam which I would propound, is, freely to acquaint Zephalinda with our Passions, and truely I have discover'd so much Vertue & discretion in her since my feign'd addresses, that my Duty to them if not to you would confine me to this, which proceeding will not only take off her resentment for what is past, but inuite her assistance in the future, & that in my opinion, can be no way so effectualy done, as by obtaineing from her to use me with a disdaine so unsufferable that my declineing her may appeare as just to my Father, as it wilbe necessary to me. Parthenissa would not graunt my desire, 'till first shee had receiv'd reitterated assurances from me that I made it, not to satisfy her suspition, which my expressions had done sufficiently, but as I held it a Iustice to Zephalinda and the best way in order to our affaires. This was no sooner fix't upon, then I apply'd my selfe to finde out an oppertunity to act it: and not many dayes after, I lighted upon one, such as I desir'd, for goeing to waite upon Zephalinda, I found her alone in her Closet, where (having shut the dore) I flung my selfe at her Feete, and told her Madam, I know not with what Face I shall disclose a secret to you, neither doe I well know how I can longer conceale it: Your goodnesse makes me desire to tell it, and the same godnesse makes me asham'd to doe soe, but since persevering in my Crime, will make the mercy I begg of you an injustice, I will no longer conceale it. 'Tis Madam, though I have made my addresses unto you, I have given my heart & liberty to Parthenissa, I was forced to this Crime to obey Moneses, and disguise a Passion as great as the offence by which I did so, But that which somewhat extenuates my Sinn is, that as soone as I had the honor to know you, I make my selfe knowne unto you, and as a testimony of the high and just opinion I have of your vertue, the same instant in which I declare I have injur'd you, I trust you with the power to punnish it; My ignorance of you made me committ my Crime, and my knowledg of you makes my Pennance, which I am confident is more severe than your justice can be. The Gods shall beare me witnesse, had I not bin preingag'd, I should have implor'd the joy of your Affection with Raptures as worthy the felicity, and I doe ill deserue it; but since it was otherwise destin'd, give me leave to conjure you to convert your Affection into freindship, I am capable of that though not worthy of it, and since I cannot give you the first place in my heart, permit me to give you an equall one in my esteeme. This Madam is the condition, and this is the request of the crimminall Artabbanes, who can hardly have the confidence to begg your pardon, because he knowes himselfe unworthy of it, & having so highly wrong'd your goodnesse, must not expect that for his satisfaction you will wrong your Iustice. Though I knew this discourse did trouble her, yet shee conceal'd hers with so much Art, that I almost doubted what I was certaine of; but judgeing by my silence, that I expected an answer, shee assur'd me, shee would not give it 'till I were risen in which I obey'd her, and then shee told me. That you have obtained a Mistris Artabbanes more worthy of you than I am, shall be alwayes my satisfaction, and not my trouble; if I receiv'd your counterfit flame, 'twas because you assur'd me 'twould create your felicity, and if I pay'd you a reall one, 'twas a duty to your Meritt; but since I loved you more than my selfe, and that the declineing of my Affection will be more pleaseing than the continuance; the same consideration that made me give it you, will induce me to recall it, yet I could wish you had never rais'd it on that you had apply'd some other cure for its suppresion: but I hope I shall be so much Mistris of my inclinations, as if they have an existence, yet they shalbe invisible, and if they must trouble any, it shalbe Zephalinda onely, who beleiveing your professions before her no Title to them, too soone entertaine'd a hope of of that, which 'twere an injustice to conferre upon her: For that freindship which you begg, it shallbe pay'd you, with a constancy and zeale worthy the object, and I will value yours at so high a rate, that I shall esteeme it almost a sufficient reparation for that pleaseing happinesse you have rob'd me of. Ah Madam (I reply'd) can you so soone pardon, and so soone oblidge? will you then allow noe Interuall betweene my fault and your Reward? if any thing could make me thinke my being Parthenissa's a misfortune, this would; But my condition is such, that the breath I should spend in the expressions of my gratitude, I must employ in begging you to increase the causes of it, 'tis Madam, that you would henceforth use; me in publique with your highest scorne; This my unworthynesse and your resentment may quickly lead you to, and upon this depends my future joy, but if you should entertaine me so in private 'twould blast all my happinesse, and destroy what it should build, for by the knowledge of your vertues I finde your freindship is as necessary to my contentment as Parthenissa's Love. I know not (said Zephalinda) to what intent you meane this, but if it be to delude the world, the action will be so opposite to my inclination, that my ill counterfiting will reveale what you would striue to hinder. Then (I reply'd) I am undone, and to make my ruine the more sensible, 'tis by the greatest vertue that ever was possest: but even now I suspected your resentment would ruine me, now I finde your goodnesse will: For Iustice to condemne is common, but for freindshipp to destroy, is a Fate only fitt for the Crime of Artabbanes, who is so unfortunate, that vertue looses its nature where he is concern'd. Zephalinda extreamly perplext to see me in so great a trouble, told me; If by any action of myne I may convert your disorder into as great a joy; assure your selfe Artabbanes, I will force my inclination to an obaying of you, aud nothing but an impossibility shall hinder me from it; therefore I conjure you acquaint me, for what great advantage you would employ my freindshipp, in a thing so inconsistent with it. Madam (said I) my Father, who knowes your merit has so strictly enjoyn'd me to serve you, that if by any fault of myne I should decline adoreing you, I must expect all that his indignation can inflict on me, and lose the hopes of possessing Parthenissa by his consent: your scorne may make the discontinuance of my addresses to you appeare a kinde of justice to him, & so incline him to listen to my makeing them to Parthenissa. You see by this how much I am therein concern'd, and by it too, how much I doe respect you, for sooner than the world should say I forsake the faire Zephalinda, I had rather give it so strong a testimony of my vnworthynesse, as her neglect. Alas Artabbanes (shee answer'd) I had rather the world should thinke you just by deserting me, than give it so infallible an argument of my want of judgement as to decline your Passion, but since your happinesse so much depends upon my counterfiting a scorne, I will endeauor to build your joy, by the ruine of my owne, and care not what men doe thinke of me, so you thereby obtaine the happy Parthenissa. Iudge Sir! if ever there were a higher generosity than this of Zephalinda's: insteed of revengeing an injury, shee pardons it; insteed of punnishing an offender, shee obliges him, and so much too to her owne prejudice, that to establish her Rivalls Contentment shee ruins (by her confession) her owne. I must confesse her vertue had so great an Ascendent over me, that I almost deplor'd the hopes of my owne felicity since they were so likely to ruin those of Hers. You may easily guesse, I left her with as high a satisfaction of her vertue, as I was troubled at the necessity of my being ungratefull to it. As soone as I came to Parthenissa I gave her by my Relation so just a cause of Affection for Zephalinda, that from that hower shee vow'd her the second place in hers, and in processe of tyme, they contracted so firme a freindshipp, that though her Brother were highly concern'd in the breakeing of Parthenissa's Affection & Mine, yet shee was not only ouer Confident but our Councellor, and discharg'd both with such secrecy and judgement, that wee knew not which was most meritorious. But this freindship could hardly be greater, than that which Arsaces had for Surena, which did every day so cleerely manifest it selfe, that the Courtiers ador'd him as the riseing Sunn, and found the only way to obtaine any thing from the King, was to be promis'd it by his favourite, who truely (setting the imperiousnesse of her hummor aside) which doubtlesse he did whilst he courted the Kings favour, he had charmes that were hardly to be resisted: Neither could Arsaces Affection to the Brother be greater, than the scornes I receiv'd in publique were from the Sister, which at first shee personated so well, that I was constrain'd often to waite upon her in private to learne whether that which we design'd for a fiction were not metamorphos'd into its contrary; but at last shee acted them as a taske, & so constrayn'd that her behaviour seem'd to condemne me of that vnkindness which her modesty would not permit her words to doe. But one Euening I receiv'd a Testimony of her Freindship proportionat to that Caracter shee had given me of it, 'Twas a litle note which shee convey'd into my hand, & though many were present, yet it was so Arteficialy, that 'twas impossible any could take notice of it. The words were these.  againe, he is resolu'd whilst you seemeingly make your addresses to me, to make his reall ones to Parthenissa, and gaine the King of his party. This you cannot resent as an iniury from either, hauing publikely declar'd a Passion to one for whome you haue none. You had best therefore suddenly breake off the false, and manifest the true flame, before Arsaces appeare too openly for your Riuall, who then may looke on your Affection as a contempt to his Authority. Tell me Artabbanes, does not the betrayeing of a Brother, the aduanceing of my Ryualls, and the ruining of my owne hopes, at least deserue your freindship, and yet that is all I demaund, since the impobissility of expecting more would be as great as the sinne of doeing so.  Princesse, who did not only much approve of the advice, but more of the gallantry of her that gave it. The same Night I waited upon Zephalinda and takeing an oportunity, I made her Parthenissa's and my owne retributions for so vnimmitable a freindship; but tyme being exceeding pretious and there being then with Zephalinda Surena, Sillaces, Lindadory, Parthenissa, and many others the Cheifest of the Court, I resolv'd no longer to delay that which was design'd betweene us,  & having privatly advertiz'd Zephalinda of my intention, I begann a discourse of the importunity of Lovers, as a Rise to effect it, The subject was so copious, that there wanted no matter of entertainment, but that we insisted upon most was, occasion'd by Zephalinda's saying, that shee admir'd at those, who when their Mistrisses declar'd they could not Love them, would yet continve their Loves: as if importunity could ingender Affection. To which Surena, as beleiveing himselfe most concern'd, reply'd: I should (Sister) have an ill opinion of that Generall, who designeing to take a Towne, would, upon it's refusall to yeeld at the Summoning, raise his Campe and martch away: 'tis just so in this case, what our desires cannot performe perseverance must, and since modesty and practice does allow women at first to deny their Servants, 'twould be a great want of discretion to take that for their disdaine which is but their fashion. Madam (said I) there may be somthing more added in this perticuler, for since by dayly experiece we finde, that a high Passion ingenders a proportionat scorne, the first giveing the Power if not the Cause unto the last, why may not we aswell expect that an importunity may begett an Affection, the difference being but equally great? That which you say (answear'd Zephalinda) is a cleere mistake, for certainly never any Woman hated a Man for Loveing her, but shee haveing some aversion to the person, he imputes it to his Flame: But to that which my Brother sayes, I must confesse, I thinke it a maddnesse, where there is an Affection to abandon it upon the first refusall, but sometimes Men are apt to give our bashfulnesse a longer being than indeed it has, and have so good an opinion of themselves, that they often call that which is our aversion our modesty, and by makeing us better natur'd than wee are, trouble themselves more than they should: for my parte, I would deale ingenuously with my Lovers (if I had any) and tell them what is modesty & what is aversion, that they may owe their sufferinge to themselves and not to me, for I thinke it a Tyranny to make mens Torments the witnesses of my Beauty. I must confesse madam (I reply'd) if all your Sex would practice what you declare, wee should have asmuch cause to Admire their goodnesse, as their Beautyes, but that which deludes many is, that some Women have hated two or three yeares, somtimes more, and then at last have loved those whome they so long slighted; and though examples of this quality be very rare, yet some proveing the possibility of it, every one flatters himselfe with a beleife it may be his Fate; just as in Warre, where though but one amongst a hundred thowsand raises himselfe from a Comon Souldier to a Generall, yet the successe of that one does raise more expectations than the miscarriages of so many others does deject. Besides Madam (said Sillaces) other Women whose Beautyes have not charmes so strong, but their Rigour may prove their Lovers cure, doe often hold onn their Servants by expectation, and so by Arte supply the vnkindnesse of Nature, but where so many perfectios reigne as you are Mistris of, that declaration which you would have passe as an excesse of goodnesse (& perhaps meane it so) may appeare as high a marke of your Power, for knowing your Servants to be surely Charm'd you may well advise them to assume their liberty, & they be no more oblig'd to you for it, than when a Gally slave is bidd by his keeper to gett free, & yett is still kep't fast in chaines. I should too much trespasse on your patience did I tell you all the perticulars of that entertainement, I will therefore only acquaint you, that some words were spoaken which gave me a fitt opportunity to begg Zephalinda, that since shee had made a declaration of dealing cleerely with her Servants in what related to her resolutions concerning them, that shee would give me my sentence, by acquainting me what returne that passion, I so justly pay'd her, might expect? Truely Artabbanes (shee Answer'd) with a gesture as full of disdaine in appearance, as it was obligeing in effect; I thought my actions would have exempted my Words from that trouble, but since you will have it in asmuch plainenesse as reallity, you must knowe, I cannot receive your passion, but if my saying wilbe a diminution of your greife, that it proceeds not from any defect in you, or from any aversion to you in perticuler, but out of a generall Aversion to Love, I may very trvely professe it. Ah Madam (I reply'd) you are cruell in thinking to be mercifull, & at once loade me with so much misery, that I must strike under the burthen: You should have prepar'd me by degrees for my Ruine & thereby have lessen'd it at least of one misery, which is the suddennesse and unexpectednesse of it: but Madam, doe not thinke that my discontent is of soe meane a nature, that the consideration of the cause can lessen the effect: noe faire Zephalinda, that with which you would console me, does but augment my Torments, for had you bin capable of Love; I should by zeale and sufferings have had some expectation to have created yours, but this generall hatred to the sweetest Passion, cutts off all expectation, & leaves me as full of misery, as my ambition for so high a Flame can merit: but madam, may not I feare some conceal'd Love is the cause of this cruelty, or that some happier, or more deserving man, may make you alter this ruinous resolution? Neither of both (said Zephalinda) I attest the higher Powers that were I to have any Man, it should be Artabbanes, but not having him, I vow by the domesticke Gods that listen to my oath, never to marry any other, and I conjure you by your owne quiett aswell as mine, to speake to me noe more of Love, nor conceale for me any, least you force me to that aversion for you, which nothing but your perseverance can render legitimate; Carry that noble Flame unto some other obiect, whose antipathy to Love may not so blinde her Iudgement, as to refuse your Passion, which I shall pray may be successfull, and that your felicity may be equall to your merit; But if in steed of my Affection you will receive my freindship, I doe engage my selfe to pay it you, and shall endeavour by the perfectnesse of That, to repaire the deficiency of the other. Ah Madam (I reply'd) all the consolation you then give me is that every one that dares offer you his heart, shalbe cloath'd in my Livery: but to make my torment perfect, my sufferings proceede from one, that at the same instant in which shee professe's her selfe my freind, ruines me: yet I shall strive by my obedience to manifest how ill I did deserve my misfortune, & since makeing my selfe perfectly wretched must be an argument of that Truth; I attest the selfesame Powers which even now you inuoak'd never to importune you any more with my Passion, but by silensing or transporting it unto some other obiect, take from us both the trouble the continuance of it would create: but the high honor of your freindship, I embrace with a joy Proportionate to the vastnesse of the benefitt, and will Pay you mine, with a constancy, as greate as you assure me your aversion is to Love. Who could expresse, the astonishment of Surena, at this Profession: his endeavours truely were so pressing to alter his Sisters resolution, that it sufficiently revealed his concearn in it, but all was in vaine; for after those protestations wee remain'd vnchangeable. This busines thus handled, was for a good while the entertainment of the Court, and made Surena so to hasten Arsaces to appeare for him, that though an vnexpected accident fell out, which much contributed to the publique declareing my selfe a Servant to Parthenissa, yet before I could effect it, Surena obtain'd from the King a visite to her in his favour, which did exceedingly perplex our Affaires, and forc'd me to mannage my Flame with a secresie as troublesome as greate; but that which I told you did so much advance my being at liberty to professe my Passion to my Princesse, was that my Father, either out of the knowledg of the World, and consequently of the emptinesse of it, or else not being able to see Surena in higher Power than himselfe, forsooke the Court, & resigneing up his Estate and Offices to me, retir'd into a Solitude, where under a seemeing banishment from all Earthly fruitions, he more perfectly enjoyed them, and either out of a disaffection to Surena, or out of his indulgence to me, he gave me the free election of my Mistris, and then (as I told you) withdrew himselfe from those cares, which take away the rellish of all our enjoyments. But Moneses could not more contemne the vanitys of the Court, than Surena was in Love with them, he had nothing but succeeded as he desir'd vnlesse it were his Passion, in which (though he neglected noe opportunity nor omitted to make use of his Masters power) his progresse was so slowe, that it clouded all his other pleasures, and by his dayly frequentation of Parthenissa discovering new charmes, it made his misfortune the more unsupportable; For my part, though I had not those publique advantages of entertaining her freely, and the Kings Power and countenance to second my addresses, yet in those happy dayes I receiv'd in private so many fresh assurances of my Princesse's Affection and constancy, that I could hardly wish my Ryvall a greater misery than the continuance of his. In this condition I was when Fortune begann to declare an irreconsilable hatred to me, in which shee ha's bin so firme, that I admire from whence shee ha's merited the Name of inconstant. The Province of Tabiena, one of the most considerable ones of Parthia generally revolted, and the Rebells having in a pitcht Battell defeated the Kings Leiutenant, and kill'd 10000 upon the place, so exasperated Arsaces that he rais'd an Army of 80000 men to vindicate this disgrace, and 'till it was upon it's martch never would declare who should be Generall; but then with a high obligingnesse, he tould me, that he had made choyce of me aswell to follow his inclination as Iudgement, that I must performe Miracles only to justifie the opinion he had of me, and that the next morning by the dawne of Day, as I value'd his service, I was to repaire unto my Command. I must confesse, I was surpriz'd, both at the thing, and at the suddennesse of it, but since 'twas the way to serve my Prince and to Glory, I supprest all those troubles which my separation from Parthenissa begann to create, and having with an humility suitable to the obligation, accepted the Kings Commission, I went that Evening to kisse the Faire Parthenissa's hands, and to offer up those sighes which that sadd departure so justly exacted; but not finding her within, I expected her returne and 'till then I entertain'd Zianthe, my Princesses favourite, who after some discourse drawing her handkerchiffe, let fall a Letter out of her pockett, & perceiveing it seal'd I snatcht it up, more out of curiosity, than any other designe; assoone as shee sawe I had it shee begg'd me with so much earnestnesse & in such pressing tearmes to restore it, that I begann to suspect it was somthing of concearnment, and findeing the superscription a Cypher only, I broake open the Leter thinkeing it had bin some private Amours of hers; but Alas I soone found it was Surenas hand, which Zianthe immagining by my amazement, shee gave a great screeke, and flinging herselfe at my Feete, with her hands held up conjur'd me to restore, and not reade it; but being thrust onn by my ill Fate, I kept her off, and read these words.  discouer the change you haue made in my fauour, his reuenge would be equall to the greatnesse of his Losse: I therefore highly approue of your opinion in employing him to Commaund the Army now design'd for the suppression of the rebellious Tabienians, and in obseruance of it haue gott the King to signe his Commission,  & strictly to enioyne him to repaire to his Charge by the breake of Day. His absence will giue us that liberty which his being here will depriue us of, and consequently render vnfortunate SVRENA.  Oh Gods! how many thousand distractions did the readeing of this Letter Involue me in. I that resented the torments cannot describe them; at first I was pale as guilt, and an universall trembling seiz'd upon all my body, yet presently, the consideration of all my wrongs inflam'd me with so much Fury, that had Parthenissa then come in, I had sacrific'd her to it, But at length I cry'd out, Great Gods! where shall vertue inhabite, if Parthenissa be not a fitt Mansion for it? and who shall ever expect a recompence for his Fidelity when mine is thus rewarded? then lookeing upon that cruell Instrument of my undoeing; I told her. Ha! Zianthe: how could you thus long conceale this Treachery? Sure Parthenissas wrekednesse is contagious, else your pitty (if all other motives had fail'd) would have made you Disclose what the just Gods could no longer conceale. The wretched Mayde findeing my Choller rais'd to the highest pitch; flung her selfe againe at my Feete and with a flood of Teares told me, The concealement (Sir) of your being so long betray'd, was as greate a greife to me, as the knowledge of it is to you, but I could not reveale that Treachery without being guilty of one to Parthenissa, and drawing by it a ruine on her as certaine as just. My Innocence shall beare me witnesse, how I labour'd to divert her from an action so perfideous, but when I found all was in vaine, I was forced to submitt to what I could not oppose, yet with a greife which equald the greatnesse of her Cryme; but since the Gods have so evidently declar'd themselves in revealeing a Treachery so secretly carryed, I thinke it rather a charity than a sinn to acquaint you with that which I hope will prove your Cure. After that Surena begann to possesse the Kings esteeme, I found a begining of a coldnesse in Parthenissa for you, and somthing of inclination for your Ryvall, which increast proportionably as Arsaces favour did, & that being come unto the highest degree this resembl'd it; in a word, I cannot compare the greatnesse of her passion to him more fittly, than to that shee formerly pay'd you: But perhapps you may wonder why they should write to one another having the opportunity & fredome of conversation. To which I answer, Surena was suspitious that all Parthenissa did professe in his favour was but meerely to gaine Tyme, and to free her selfe from the Kings importunities, who never left soliciting for his favourite; Now he knew, Letters were a proofe that shee could not deny, when shee might her words, therefore he putt her to that Tryall, and besides, he shewed them to the King as an evincement of his victory, which as he said Arsaces would not creditt but by some such undeniable Testimony. Things being come to this height, all their designes were how to delude you, which truely they were so industrious in, that I have as often admir'd at Parthenissa's art in dissembling, as at her Treachery it selfe. Amongst all those Presents which Surena sent her, shee places on none so much value, as on a little Pockett-lookeing-Glasse which of late you have seene her weare, and though the excellency of the workemanship might induce her to vallue it, yet the esteeme shee places on it, proceedes from another Cause, for betweene the Glasse and the Case, in a little drawer which is arteficially shutt with a screwe, there is her Lovers Picture; and as if all things had contributed to undelude you, yesternight somthing being amisse in it, shee left it off to be mended. Zianthe without staying to knowe whether I had a minde to see it, went and fetch't it, to shew the truth of what shee had alleag'd. The Glasse I very well remember'd having seene Parthenissa lately were it and sett euen a doting vallue on it, but the rage of being so egregiously deluded stifl'd those resentments my Fury inspir'd, which silence Zianthe attributing to my attention, shee thus continu'd her discourse. I have Sir given you a cleere narrative, of my Mistrisses infidelity, which indeede is so excessive greate, that I hope you will thinke it a sufficient happinesse to have mist her, and your Ryvall sufficiently punnish't in obtayning her; In my opinion the Crime is so odious, that with the first opportunity I will abandon her service, & thinke it more contentment to have but a bare subsistance where innocence is cherish't than to possesse all the plenties of the Court, where vice has so much Dominion: all that I have to begg of you is that you will make the best profitt of this discovery, without revealeing the Author of it, for it can be no advantage to you, & wilbe an vnauoydable ruine unto me. Zianthe thus ended her discourse, & fil'd me with so much Fury, that without saying one word, I left her, but as I was goeing out, I mett a Servant of Surena's who mistakeing me for one of Parthenissa's meniall ones desir'd me to tell Zianthe, that her Princesse lay that Night at Surena's with Zephalinda, and that he was come to waite on her thither. This additionall proofe of her inconstancy made me say to my selfe: Is shee then not only contented to be wicked, but to glory in't? and has shee no sooner lead me into misery, than shee forsakes and insults over me? but yet (I continu'd) why doe I blame this action, for since shee has stayn'd her Beauty with infidelity, 'tis an obligation to me not to hide it. Then without so much as answering Surena's Servant, I went to my Lodging, but in such a posture, that had I mett with any betwixt that place where I receiv'd so fatall a Poyson and my Chamber, my actions had discover'd my condition: being come home, I flung my selfe into my Bedd and by a thousand extravagancyes exprest the Miseries I groan'd under; at first I resolv'd to kill my selfe having so much out-liv'd my hopes, but the horror of so barbarous a Cryme, and to leave the world without revenge retain'd me. Then casting up my Eyes to Heaven, my Teares invoak'd that justice my Rage hinder'd my words from demanding. At lenght I cry'd out, Great Gods! why doe you tempt fraile man so justly to destroy himselfe, and yet make it a sinn to doe soe, or why is life esteem'd a blessing, when without it we could not suffer misery. Then pauseing a while, & after starting up; I continu'd, Ah! noe, were to destroy my selfe no sinn, I would not doe it: First those that have injur'd me shall dye, & then the Tryumph of my Revenge wilbe pleaseing: yet Parthenissa must not fall, her Sex presevres her; but to kill her Lover, wilbe a more sensible greife to her and consequently a more pleaseing joy to me. But couldst thou (I continu'd) Artabbanes, looke upon her with any satisfaction were her miseries proportionate to her crymes? o no, those charmes would melt thy anger into pitty, rather kill thy Ryvall nobly, and shew by his destruction how much shee has mischosen, then flye into some Desart, where thou shalt never heare againe th'enchaunting name of Parthenissa, and in the horror of some silent Grove, pine away thy life as a pennance for haveing beleev'd any of her Sex could prove constant. My distractions were so high, that it was day ere I could elect any resolution, yet in the end I assum'd this last as findeing it fittest for my resentment and despaire, and immediately calling Symander, I Commanded him with secresy and without dispute to carry a Paper I gave him to Surena, and tell him I expected him in the Easterne Meddow neere the sacred Grove. The Challenge contain'd these words.  you, bnt you must dispute the Conquest with your Sword, and by that Tryall proue whether the Gods wilbe as fauourable to you, as her infidelity. In a word My Death must secure your Affections, and yours must revenge me on your perfidious Mistris; and though her inconstancy render her unworthy my resentments, yet your addresses to her after you knew of myne, renders you worthy of my Revenge.  Symander immediatly suspected what it was, but not immagining the cause, began to make some questios for which I tooke him up fo short, that I putt a silence to all his doubts, and sent him away to performe what I had commanded; then dressing my selfe, I tooke one of my best Horses (for 'tis the custome in Parthia for all men of quallity to fight on horseback) and went to the place appointed, where I had not long bin, but Symander came, and acquainted me that Surena would be with me instantly. These words were hardly deliver'd when I might perceive him that sent them, only attended by one of his Servants. I had not the patience to delay my Revenge by any expostulation, but drawing my Sword, and gallopping up to him, bade him defende himselfe. The first encounter he gave me a slight hurt upon the bridle-hand, and I him in his right-Arme, and after a few Passades for the gaineing of the Crupper, I wonne his, and ranne my Sword through him up to the hilte, with which he fell, and goeing to repeate my thrust, the remembrance of his excellent Sister, stopt my hand, and made me tell him, That which I have done though it be too little for my resentments yet it is too-much for Zephalindas Brother, for which relation I give thee thy Life. If (reply'd Surena) thou payst Zephalinda any Affection evince it in takeing that litle I have left, shee is so generous, shee had rather heare I am dead, than live by my Enemyes Mercy, therefore I conjure thee by those wrongs thou sayst I have done thee,  & by thy affection to my Sister, finish what thy good Fortune has so farr advanc't, & by one wound more end those Torments my being vanquisht, will throwe upon me, & secure thy Love to Parthenissa, which whilst I live wilbe unsafe. Why (said I) dost thou by that name tempt my Fury, and reviue an anger whose justice is declar'd in thy defeate, farewell for I dare not trust my selfe with my resentments. Ending these words, I turn'd to Surena's Servant and bad him have a care of his Master. Then goeing to my owne, I told him, come Symander, since death refuses to ease my misery, I will seeke some other Cure, and commanding him to follow, I gallopt away whether my Fortune would conduct me, and continu'd moveing 'till towards Night, when comeing into a Grove, whose unfrequentednesse was fitt for my melancholly aswell as safety (for I was loath Parthenissa should satisfy her Eyes with my execution) I lighted off my Horse, and giveing him to Symander I flung my selfe upon the Grasse, and there began to consider the sadd condition I was in, which was so much the more so, by how much my happinesse had bin so lately great. Parthenissa's inconstancy appear'd so odious, that I could not have the patience to thinke on her nor it: But that which caus'd indeed my reall greife, was, the unworthy retourne my sadd condition forc't me to make the faire Zephalinda, who for all her gallantry and freindshipp, had no other payment but the neglect of her Affection, and the Murther of her Brother. These thoughts were more insupportable than my owne misfortunes, & that which brought an accession to mine was that my Actions of ingratitude would be as apparent, as my sorrowes for them would be the contrary. After a thousand reflections of this quality, I resolv'd at last to write to her, & findeing no lncke more proper for the ocasion than some Blood which rann from a slight hurt I made use of it, and writ these fewe words.  your pardon is begg'd by the miserable Artabbanes, whose Love and hatred to Parthenissa were ordain'd to make him equally injurious to your quiet, I must confesse, it had bin more suitable to my despaire aswell as freindship, to have fallen by Surena's Sword,  & so have merited your pitty, rather than to have bin necessitated to implore your Mercy. But Great Gods! to what a straight did you reduce me? To dye had bin the Tryumph of my Enemy, and to kill makes the trouble of my Freind, the first rendring me unfortunate, the latter guilty: but since those Powers which create our destinyes has made the last of these mine; I am resolu'd to take some such forlorne course that though you cannot commend the past Actions, yet you shall the future sufferings I will inflict upon the crimminall Artabbanes.  I writ another Letter to Arsaces, wherein I told him, that I was almost asmuch troubl'd to drawe my Sword against his Favourite, as at the Cause of it; that I had injur'd his Lawes, to avoyde doeing the like unto his judgement, which might have receiv'd some blemish by his electing one to revenge a publique affront that wanted Courrage to resent a private one of the highest nature; that though by this action I had render'd my selfe vncapable of serveing him, yet by declineing it I had made my selfe unworthy of that honor, so that of two crimes I elected but the least, and since the Gods by Surenas defeate, declar'd him guilty, I could not beleeve that he which boare their Image, would be of a different opinion. I foulded these two letters in a third to my generous freind the Prince Sillaces to whose care I commended Lindadory, and all things else I had any concerne for, and from whome I begg'd a thousand pardons, for not having acquainted him at first with the cause of those miseryes which forc'd me to a voluntary & eternall banishment. Whilst our Horses were takeing that refreshment, which their hard travell requir'd I was disputeing what course to elect, and after many proposalls, I resolv'd to passe thorough Mesopotamia, & Syria, and so thence by Sea for Italy, and in the darkest horrors of those Mountaines which separates that Country from the Gauls spend those sadd dayes alotted to my miserable Life. That which made me fixe upon this place above any other, was, that the horridnesse of the Alpes would be more suitable to my Melancholly than any other, and by being in the heart of the Roman Empire, I knew the innate hatred of the Parthians to that People would never permit those which should search after me to doubt of my residence, or if they did, the danger of comeing into an Enemyes Country, might deterr them from following me. Heare Artabbanes putting a stopp to his narration addrest himselfe to Callimmachus, and told him, I have Sir, to obey your Commands forc't my inclination to relate unto you a parte of my vnfortunate Life, lest you might have fail'd in the knowledg of those perticulers which perhaps Symander was not perfectly acquainted with, But now, what is remaining he has bin an Actor or a sufferer in & consequently will omit nothing that is worthy your knowledg, I shall therefore begg you (if you are not already tir'd with the hearing my misfortunes) permit Symander to put an ende unto their Story, and give me leave to absent my selfe from a relation that will waken a despaire, which of it selfe is but too-apt to torment me. The good Callimmachus haveing by a Thousand expressions excus'd the rudenesse of his curiosity told him, Generous Artabbanes, I have alreaddy (I feare) so farre transgrest that I cannot expect a pardon from a lesse goodnesse than yours, and therefore will not persevere in a Crime which may make you as justly my Enemy, as Fortune is vnjustly yours. Artabbanes having made Callimmachus a retourne suitable to his Civility, commanded his faithfull Symander (who) was present at the latter parte of his relation to satisfy his engagement, and then retir'd into a solitude, to entertaine his Melancholly, which was too just not to be greate. Artabbanes was noe sooner gone then Callimmachus invited the faithfull Symander to obey his generous Prince which he did by continuing his Adventures in these Words. despaire,  & that all those reasons my Affection furnisht me with, could noe way alter it, I thought it my duty asmuch as 'twas my Inclination, to beare a share with him in all his miseries, and justify by my sufferings how ambitious I was to deserve a favour which I had noe title to but his haveing conferr'd it on me; & though by many perswasions and commands he diswaded me from tying my Fortunes upon one to whome (he said) the Gods had so much declar'd themselves Enemyes, yet I was as firme in my resolution of waiteing on him, as he was in his of abandoning the world. By this tyme our Horses haveing taken that rest which we thought fiting, wee began to continue our Iourny the Moone affording us hir Light, and the first Village wee came unto we waken'd some Peasants, where my Prince having seald his Packet enguag'd one of them (by giveing him a good reward) to carry it the next day to the Court and present it to the generous Sillaces. This being done wee continued our voyadge, but because I have so many essentiall things to relate, I will not loade your patience by repeating all those accidents which happen'd in our crossing of Siria and Mesopotamia, nor till our comeing to Antioch since without any considerable adventures we at last safely arrived there, only I may not omitt to informe you, that in Twenty dayes travell I never heard Artabbanes repine at Parthenissia's cruelty, either that his wrongs had extinguisht his Love, or the greatnesse of his resentments hinder'd the expressions of them, but I am the more inclin'd to beleive the latter, since his sighes & Teares (his inseperable Companions) acknowledged some internall greife produc'd them, & truely he was thereby so chang'd, that had not his greifes bin an undeniable proofe of him that vtter'd them, I should have suspected I had chang'd my Master. But as if all things had contributed to hasten my Prince unto his solitude, wee mett a Shipp at Antioch, ready to weigh Anchor for Cyprus, where shee was to vnloade hir Marchandize in a Man-of-Warre that was directly bound for Ostia, which is a small Harbour the Tyber makes when it falls into the Mediterranean-Sea. This conveniency wee joyfully embrac'd, and the Winde blowing faire at East wee were full of expectation in few Dayes to arrive safely in that famous Iland, where the Queene of Love had chosen her earthly Residence. Wee were not many leagues from our desired harbour when those upon the maine- Topp that were lookeing for Land, cry'd out a Sayle, a Sayle, The Master of our shipp went instantly upp to discover the Truth of this Alarum, and had not bin long there but clapping his hand upon his Brest he said with great Passion we are all undone 'tis Menas. This was that Menas Pompey the greate tooke at Sea, when he commanded the Roman Fleete, and askeing him how he durst commit so high Sinns, as to kill those and take away their goods which never did him wrong, was thus answear'd: If (said he) my actions are Crimes, why then dost thou practice them? but because thou robb'st securely with a whole Fleete, thou givest thy selfe the name of a Conqueror, and because I robb with more hazzard, and but with one single Gally, thou callst me a Pyrate, when there is no difference betweene our Performances but that which Force and Numbers create. This bold (and perhaps true) reply so operated on the generous Pompey, that he gave Menas his life, for which he did him such signall services, that at last he gave him too his liberty, But being accustomed from his Youth to that barbarous profession, he could not decline it, & in a short while after fell to a Relaps. He was indeede so famous in all those Sea's, that often-tymes his Name Presented him with Victory: and truely I beleeve wee should have felt as well as heard that Truth, had not Artabbanes (perceiveing our Feares) by a generous Exhortation invited us to a defence, For, if (said he) your Enemyes are Generous, your Gallantry, if you be vanquisht, wil make your usage so: if they are not, your resistance may purchase your safety, at least 'tis more like Men to owe our sufferings to our misfortunes than our Selves. To be breife, his ravishing eloquence furnisht him with such powerfull arguments, that those timerous spirits which even now were readdy to yeeld without disputeing the Victory, were now so alter'd, that they breath'd nothing but the Combate. Wee were in all (Passengers and Sea- men) about an hunderd, and my Prince takeing upon himselfe the whole charge, divided his Men into two Squadrons, the one he tooke to himselfe, and the other he gave me the honor to command. Then least those new raisd Courages should coole, he Commanded the Pilot to tack about and resolv'd to save Menas the labour of overtakeing him, who was chaseing us with Oares and Sayles. 'Twas then I perceiv'd in my generous Prince's Face a dissipation of those Clowdes his Miseries had there created, and in their place a Countenance so martiall & so charming, that 'twas as impossible for his Enemyes not to feare, as for his Freinds not to admire him. By this tyme the Pyrates were so close come up, that Artabbanes commanded the Sea-men to grapple with Menas's Gally, & not giveing him leave to assault us, he leap't into the thickest of the Enemy's, and with his Sword made the Passe easy for those that follow'd him. Our Adversaries who were not accustomed to resistance found this Action as strange as we knew it to be Generous, And I beleeve their amazement something contributed to our seemeing victory, but when those that fledd the fury of my Prince's Armes, had acquainted Menas that vnlesse he appear'd and acted all would be lost, that old Pyrate who at first thinkeing us unworthy his Sword, had commanded one of his Leiutenants to take us, finding our resistance needed all his Power, instantly arm'd himselfe, and with a select Number of Souldiers which he alwayes reserv'd for some such desperate exigency, came out upon the Decks, where, by the greatnesse of his Losse judgeing at the greatnesse of his danger, he call'd up that Courage which had made him so justly famous, & there with renew'd the Fight with such resolution, that many of our men being terrified by the fury of his blowes, began to shrinke, and at last to retire unto their owne Shipp, This Cowardice heightned our Enemyes, which Artabbanes easily perceiv'd, and observeing the turne proceeded only from the vallour of Menas, he made a lane through all those that oppos'd his doeing so, and at last joyneing the old Pyrate, with one blow, he strooke him at his Feete, and findeing by the rare temper of his Helmet, that his fall proceeded from being stunn'd not kil'd, he was searching the defects of his Armour to finish his victory, which whilst he was doeing, one of the Pyrates comeing behinde him, had lift up his Sworde to kill my generous Prince, but as the Gods would have it, I came to his rescue, and with one blowe cutt that sacralegious Arme off, & with a thrust ended his Life. The noyse which the Pyrate I had kill'd made in falling, saved Menas's Life, for my Prince turning about to learne from whence that Death proceeded, some of the Enemyes (takeing the opertunity) dragg'd their Captaine into the Sterne- Cabbin. but to be breife, our Companions whose Courages (by the sight of so much blood) were quite drown'd, abandon'd the generous Artabbanes, who being too-weake of himselfe having only so unworthy a second as Symander to resist such Numbers as came fresh upon him, receiv'd so many wounds, that his strength began to faile him, but yet upon his knees he so generously disputed the victory, that Fortune by it appear'd sufficiently blinde, for could shee have seene his vertue shee could not but have rewarded it, but at length he lost such a Sea of blood, that he could make no more resistance, and crying out, Ah Death! thou art mercifull and curest the wounds which Parthenissa gave he fell (as I then thought) eternally. Oh Gods! what did not my rage then make me vtter? I found my Greife so just; that bestrideing my generous Princes Body I cry'd out, finish, finish yee barbarous Tyrants your Cruelty, and bend all your Swords against my Brest, for since you have by Numbers not vallour destroyed the perfectest of Men, I will noe longer surviue that Losse, & indeede their desire of blood so well seconded my desire of loosing all mine that haveing received as many wounds as I was confident would not give me the misfortune of out-liveiug my Prince, I flung my selfe on his pale body, and haveing a Thousand tymes embraced him and kist his Hands and Feete I there fainted, acting those last expressions of my fidelity. In the meane while Menas by the care of his Souldiers being come againe to himselfe demanded what was the issue of the Fgiht, & what was become of him whose vallour he had so much to his prejudice resented? they answer'd him, that all but the valiant Enemy he enquir'd after, & one more had long since yeelded themselves to mercy, but he as if his Forces had bin increased by his Companions Feares, was yet nobly disputeing his Life which was so weakn'd by many wounds that if he were not yet dead the tyme of his fall could not be long. Menas whose nature had some light of generossity though clouded by his professiion and the dayly examples of Cruelty, was so taken with Artabbanes Courage, that causeing himselfe to be carryed upon the Deck, did there intend to preserve him if it were in his power. I knew not whether the beleife of our being kill'd hinder'd our Conquerors from doeing us any further harme, or whether my expressions and actions to my Prince did suspend for a while the cruelty of those Monsters, but whatsoever was the cause, they wounded us noe more after we were fallen, & Menas comeing when the Pyrates were begining to stripp us, forbadd it, and commanded his Chyrurgions to employ all their skill in our recovery, or if it were past their Arte, then he order'd Gallippus his Leiutenant to give us buriall as if himselfe had bin in our condition, and because his care should equall our neede of it, he caus'd us to be brought into his owne Cabbin, where our wounds being search't the Chyrurgions assur'd him, my Master had none that were mortall, and that only the losse of blood had reduc'd him to that extremity, For what concern'd me they told him, I was in much more danger, but if they could drawe out the head of a iavelin that stuck in my back, there might be some hope of my recovery, in the meane tyme by strong Cordialls wee came to our selves, but my Prince long before me, & to my great glory (as those that waited on us told me) the first thing he said was, ah poore Symander, For my parte, as soone as I found my wounds drest & remember'd with what designe I receiv'd them, I toare off all my Playsters, and calling those that were by me a Thousand-Names for their care, I vow'd by all the Gods I would no longer Live, then I begg'd them with Teares to bring me to my Masters body, and permit me to expire upon it. They seem'd to be very gladd, that my despaire proceeded from a Cause they could so easily remove, and therefore to console me, they vow'd my Master was alive and in the same Cabbin, but I could not credit so great a happinesse 'till some of them acquainted him with my diffidence, which made him force himselfe to say Yes Symander I live, Fortune is yet too-much my Enemy to end my miseries. Ah Sir, (I reply'd with excessive raptures of joy) your vertue will at last Conquer her. 'Tis a strange thing how after the knowledg of my Princes being alive I willingly endur'd all those hideous Paines which conduc'd to my recovery, courting my Chyrurgions to hasten my cure though by the increase of my torment, that I might be quickly well, to be neere my Prince, and to pay him that Service I had ever vow'd him. During the space of a quarter of a yeare whilst our wounds were healing, wee receiv'd as many Civilities from Menas as wee could possibly have expected from our best Freinds, but wee were noe sooner perfectly recover'd than he commanded my Prince to be brought unto him, and with a Countenance (as barbarous as his profession) told him, I have sent for thee to know what madnesse 'twas invited thee to make a resistance where hope (as flattering as 'tis) could not affoard thee a probability of successe? To which my Prince reply'd with an assurednesse more suitable to his Mind than his condition, I know not why thou shouldst thinke it strange, that the desire of preserving my liberty should not be as powerfull with me, as that of depriving me of it or of a litle gaine was with thee, but when my Life was as great a blessing to me as now it is the contrary, I never knew why Death was not a beter election than Chaines. Yet me thinkes (said Menas) thou shouldst not preferr Death before Captivity, since the former cutts off all expectation and the latter allowes thee some. The first (reply'd Artabbanes) as it cutts off all hope, so it cutts off all shame & suffering, and the latter, whilst it leaves us only expectations of good, makes us resent reall evills: but if there be any Spirits so lowe as to make such a choyce, I wish it may be their Fortune. How dar'st thou (said the old Pyrate) so farre provoke me, when thou know'st thy Life is in my hands? Because (reply'd Artabbanes) 'tis in thy hands. But why (continu'd Menas didst thou tye thy selfe so obstinately to me, rather than any other, when thou knewest that by it thou gaue'st him the Will that had the Power to punish thee? I found thee (said my Prince) the worthyest of my Sword, and where an action is gallant 'tis not my custome to consult with feare. Artabbanes had no sooner spoake those words than Menas embrac't him & cry'd out, o the most generous amongst Men if Pompey the Great were not liveing, thou deservest thy liberty, but to be his is more glorious than freedome, and 'tis to that honor I designe thee After a million of barbarous expressions of the high esteeme he had of my Masters generosity, he declar'd he should be his companion 'till his arrivall at Ostia (which was the place wee had at first design'd though for a different intention) where in few dayes after wee came, and there Menas elected Fourscore of his best Slaves (the most of them Gentlemen) amongst which my Prince and I were Two) and having tyed to every of them a little Chaine of Gold as an evincement of servitude, he sent us a shore under the conduct of Gallippus a Cilisian, in whome he put his greatest confidence and who was order'd to present us to Pompey. The next day after our landing, wee came to Rome, and sawe that glorious Towne proud with the spoyles of all the World, & some of those great Men who from private Cittizens rais'd themselves by their vertue to give Lawes to mighty Kings, & have in tyme added more Crownes to the Empire of Rome than there are almost Inhabitants within hir walls, But wee soone learn't that Pompey the Great had but lately undertaken the voyage of Asia, to receive Lucullus's Command and Army, who was sent for back by the Senate, being, after all his victories become a Triumph to his Souldiers. Yet though Pompey had left Rome he was not gone out of Italy, but was necessitated to remaine at Capua for some dispatches which were not perfected. This made Gallippus send a Messenger to Menas for his orders, & us continue for some tyme longer in Rome than otherwise we should have done. I cannot here omit a very remarkeable accident that befell my Prince, who as he slept had a Snake which came and inuiron'd his Temples in the forme of a Lawrell, which a Slave possest with Bacchvs spirit of divination observeing cry'd but, that it was an infallible signe of his being victorious and successefull in the Warres. By this Menas had sent directions for us to goe by Land to Capua where Pompey then was, and where at last wee arriv'd, and were by Gallippus presented to him just as he was goeing to take Sipp for Asia. This great Man (when he sawe Artabbanes) fix't his Eyes on him, and calling some of his familiar Freinds told them, either all the Rules of Phisiognomy are false; or that Slave (pointing at my Prince) is not what his present habit speakes him, but possesses a Minde that deserves as good a Fortune as that he is now in is ill. Sir (reply'd Gallippus) his lookes cannot promise more Gallantry than his Actions will make good, and had not Menas esteem'd it a higher happinesse for him to be your Slave than to be free, he had long since restor'd him to that liberty his misfortune not his want of Courage made him loose: Thereupon Gallippus told him all the Story how my generous Master was taken Prisoner, which when Pompey had heard he reply'd. The Gods forbidd, that because your Captaine ha's a better opinion of me than I merit, that therefore this Prisoner should vndergoe a misery which by your owne confession he does not but upon that score. Thereupon he commanded Gallippus to set my Prince free, and to tell Menas, That furnishing him with an occasion to oblige a gallant-Man, was a greater Present than all those other Slaves he bestow'd on him. Gallippus, who had contracted a high opinion for my Masters vertue, was goeing with great satisfaction to observe Pompey's directions, when Artabbanes ill Fate (which has never bin tyr'd with aflicting him) made Lentulus Batiatus (who was extreamly taken with my Prince) so earnestly to begg him of Pompey, that at last (though with much reluctancy) he revoak'd his promise, and not only graunted Batiatus his request, but also gave him all those other Slaves which Menas had presented him. This Batiatus was the cheifest Cittizen in Capua, and one who Pompey durst not disoblige, being of his Councell in that great designe of makeing himselfe Emperor of all the world, whose foundation was then lay'd, but after was destroy'd by the happier Fortune of Iulivs Caesar, who possest what this did but immagin. Batiatus having waited upon Pompey out of Capua, was no sooner return'd, than calling for my Prince he ask'd him his Name and Country. Artabbanes, whose hatred for him was as great as just, told him with an accent which exprest his resentment, That being a Slave he had nither Name nor Country. Which reply so insenc't the Barbarous Batiatus, that he commanded him instantly to be putt into Chaynes and kept with his other common slaves. Great Gods! when I sawe those hands loaden with Irons, which if vertue had bin a title to Empire should have swayed the Scepters of the World, what did not my fury suggest in me? I curst a Milion of tymes Parthenissa's inconstancy that had cast my deare Master into miseries almost as great as his vertve, and condemn'd with many imprecations the weaknesse of Pompeys, which the desire of an vnworthy Cittizen could so soone destroy, at last I was resolv'd to acquaint our Tyrant with my Princes quality & birth, and by the assurance of an excessive ransome, free him from that Ceptivity his vnjust Fate had flung him into, But then the consideratio of those sacred oathes Artabbanes had extorted from me never to reveale that secret but by his consent supprest my resolution, and made me take up that of endeavoring to perswade him to it himselfe or else to give me his permission for it. Therefore takeing my opportunity I begg'd him with a streame of Teares, that he would not by an obstinate silence vndergoe so lowe a destiny, but by acquainting Batiatus with his quality, procure a civill usage 'till his Ransome came, That then he would retourne into Parthia, there having obtain'd a Pardon for Surenas death, evince to Parthenissa, by a carriadge voyde of all trouble, how easily he could divest himselfe of his Passion, when shee could throwe off her Constancy, that 'twas her vertue not her Beauty only he ador'd, and since shee could decline the first he could as easily the latter. Hold thy peace Symander (said my Prince interrupting me) doe not add unto my miseries by thy impious discourse of Parthenissa, shee is yet the higest thing in my esteeme, for I am upon better consideration apter to beleive, 'twas some defects shee found in me than any which were in her that made her recall the blessed joy of her Affection, and so that which thou tearm'st inconstancy may be her Iustice, No, no, Symander (he continu'd) since the Gods have profest themselves so much my Adversaries, tye not thy Fortune unto the most wretched of Men: I have some Iewells that 'scap't the Pyrates, take them & buy thy freedome, then retourne into thy Country, where I shall pray thou may'st enjoy a felicity equall to thy vertue, & let me alone to wrestle with my misfortunes, for I had farre rather perish in this miserable Prison & under the weight of these Chaines, than see Parthenissa scorne my Flame, or by her embraces recompence any others, By this thou mayst in some sorte gesse at the greatnesse of my Torments, when Slaverie is a comparative happinesse. My Prince had noe sooner done speakeing, than flinging my selfe at his feete, I told him, oh Sir! have all my services not yet obtain'd your leave to beare a share in your misfortunes? can you speake to me of felicity when you are loaden with Irons? alas! what fault have I comirted, that you should esteeme me worthy the misery of liberty? I attest the Gods, that the sence of your Torments, create the greatest I endure, and that I can drowne my owne by the consideration of yours whose liberty I would joyfully purchase by the losse of my owne Eternally: therefore Sir (I continu'd embraceing of his knees) I conjure you by your vertue, and those services which I hope I shall live to pay you, & by that Parthenissa, whome you doe yet so highly reverence, doe not banish me from the glory of suffering with you, nor have so lowe an opinion of my fidelity as to think any thing but Death shall separate me from you. To which Artabbanes reply'd, That his knowledge of my Affection for him, and not my diffidence of it made him presse me to returne into Parthia, but since I assur'd him, to be neere his person was a higher satisfaction he graunted my request though it were to the augmentation of his misery, which he profest to me was much increast by the share I had in it. I had scarce kist his hands as an acknowledgement of his favour and my Ioy but Batiatus came in, who commanded his Chaines to be taken off, that he might be the fitter for that employment to which next morning he design'd him, then he selected some Twenty of the ablest Slaves, who together with Artabbanes were sett a Parte for Gladiators, and then went away. These Gladiators (as the Romans call them) are certaine Captives who are kept to fight at Sharpe one against another in Amphitheaters, for their Masters or the Peoples pastime, which sorte of Combates alwayes ends at least with the losse of much blood, & often tymes with the Lives of the Actors. As soone as my Prince learn'd by some of the other Slaves what he was destin'd to, he curst a hunder'd tymes his ignorance of the Roman Customes that had say'd Batiatus Life, for certainely had he knowne the cause why his Chaines were taken off, he had employ'd them to kill the Commander of it. But after haveing walked two or three turnes, with lookes and actions expressing his just resentments, he at last desir'd his fellow Prisoners silence and attention, which being easily obtain'd he spoake to them much to this purpose. Freinds and Companions in misery, That Fortune has made us Slaves is her Fault, that wee should continue so wilbe ours, since a quiet submission to her Cruelty tacitly acknowledges we deserve it, and makes that which is an effect of her blindnesse appeare a confession of her Iustice, You have assur'd me offten that y'are all Gentlemen, That Title obliges you sooner to weare Deaths livery than Batiatus's, let us therefore by some gallant attempt, show how worthy we were of liberty, or by dying handsomly how unworthy we are of Chaines, Death is the worst can befall us, yet it is a comparative happinesse to our present condition: If the Gods doe not favour our endeavours but take from us all those wayes that leade to freedome, they doe thereby invite us to kill our selves, which to performe is not to sinn, but to obey them. To move us to this, you see to what the cruell Batiatus designes us, let us therefore resolue, tomorrow, when wee are upon the Theater arm'd, to make use of our Swords to a contrary action to that for which they were given us, and since they delight in blood, let us make them surfett of it by employing our lives which they destin'd for their pleasure unto their punishment, This is the way, if we cannot reach our liberty yet at least to reach Revenge, which wilbe as pleasing as the Irons we now weare are insupportable. My Prince had no sooner done speaking than Canitius (one of the cheifest amongst the Slaves reply'd) That he was sorry such powerfull inducements were lay'd downe to invite them to that action since their vndertakeing of it now would rather appeare to proceed from their Iudgements than their Inclinations, That he so well vnderstood the hearts of his companions, he durst enguage himselfe they would every one of them elect Death before Slavery, but that he was of opinion they might obtaine their liberty by a lesse hazardous way then what was then propounded, for Every day (said he) the Gladiators are to fight 'tis the custome to feede them very early that they may digest their meate before the combatt, & be the better able to performe it, This being most certaine, my advice is, when our Keepers tomorrow come in to feede us, wee seize upon their Swords and kill them, least they should make any noyse, then with their Keyes we may open the Dores to our liberty, and perhaps (being early) the Streetes may be so empty of people that with little resistance wee may gett out of the Towne and recover the Mountaines of Pettely where 'twill be difficult if not impossible to take us. This motion was highly relisht by all the company, and the onely thing my Prince dislik't in it, was, that Batiatus would 'scape vnpunish't, but the rest consenting, he sawe 'twas in vaine to oppose it. You may easily immagin wee were not a litle impatient 'till the breake of day, which noe sooner appear'd than our keepers (which were Fower in Number) came into our Prison, where whilst they were distributing of victualls and blowes together (for Cruelty is a badge inseparable from their office) Artabbanes, Canitius, one Castus and I, drew out their Swords and sheath'd them in their owne bodyes with such expeditio, that they had their Fate before they could feare it, Then takeing their Keyes wee open'd the Dores of the Prison, & comeing into the great Court of Batiatus house (which wee were necessitated to passe thorough to get into the streete) wee might perceive him (as the Gods would have it who allwayes punish cruelty) attended only by a couple of his meniall Servants, and (as wee conjectur'd) comeing to visite us; his amazement was so great when he sawe us all at liberty, that he had not the power to fly, which gave Castus sufficient tyme to take away his Life, but his Servants scap't, and by their Cryes drew many people into the streets, most of them in their shirts, for it was very early; Those of the Capuans that had Armes perceiveing wee had but fower Swords fell upon us very resolutely, and (doubtlesse) had cut us off had we not recover'd a narrow lane, where my Prince, Canitius, Castus and I (who were those only that had Armes) makeing good the entrance of it gave our Companions tyme to breake into a Cookes shopp that was behinde us, where having fitted themselves, some with spitts, others with long knives and such kinde of Weapons, observeing how our Enemyes increast, and that delay would bring a certaine ruine, wee charg'd them so furiously, that wee made way through all those that opos'd us, and by the death of some Thirty or Forty, recover'd that Gate of the Towne which leades to the Mountaines of Pettely just as some of the Inhabitants were goeing to shut it, who as soone as they perceiv'd us, fledd, & left us a free passage, the Capuans not dareing then to pursue us any farther. In this retreate my Prince and Canitius brought up the Reare, Castus and I lead our Companions, and though wee foure were wounded, yet 'twas so favourably, that it hinder'd not our martch. Wee were not sixteene furlongs out of Capua (which according to the Roman accompt makes two Miles) when we overtooke some Horses loaden with Weapons for Fencers goeing to Salapia, those horse and Armes wee seiz'd on (but did their Owners no harme) and had scarcely fitted our selves with them, when we might perceive 300. Capuans that follow'd us with an eagernesse that spoake their intentions. The inequality of our Numbers did something startle our Companions at the first, but my generous Prince so animated them, that he made them not only resolve to fight, but save the Capuans the labour of halfe their martch, The Enemy perceiving our intentions receiv'd our charge with much resolution, but Artabbanes gave it with more, and did act in that occasion things so worthy himselfe, that at last the Capuans were routed, and most of them kill'd, for wee follow'd the Execution to their very Gates, which wee found so ill guarded (an vniuersall feare having seiz'd upon all the Inhabitants) that had our Numbers bin proportionable to our advantage, we might have possest that great Citty. But wee were satisfied with our successe, and at Night retir'd our selves to a place of a very strong scituation which Castus shew'd us, who by good fortune was perfectly acqvainted with that Countrey. This place I speake of was a Hill of a great height in the Middle of a Plaine about Eight Furlongs circumference, and inaccessible every way but one, by which also there could not come above five a brest, The next morning wee met together to choose our selves a Captaine, knowing that a Body how litle soever without a Head is a monster. My Prince was elected, whose vallour and conduct in the late fight gave him that place without either opposition or enuy, to whome we all swoare obedience 'till we might gett out of Italy & so returne to our owne Countryes, for wee were of severall Nations though the most of any one were Thracians. Then our new Souldiers desiring to knowe their Captaines Country and Name, came and begg'd of him the knowledge of both, but my Prince who would not acquaint them with eitheir, least it might in tyme discover him, desir'd their excuse, telling them he was ty'd to a concealement of both by some high considerations, The Thracians then who I told you were the most in number of any one Countrey cryed out, that they would thence-forwards call him Spartacus, which in their Language signifies Captaine or generall, and all the rest willingly consented to it, which I shall begg you (said Symander to Callimachus to take notice of, for I shall for a while call my generous Master no more but by that Name, since 'twas under it he purchas'd so great a proportion of Glory that it cannot have an ende till the World has. O Gods! (said Callimachus to Symander) Is it then Artabbanes, that under the name of Spartacus, did from so weake a begining shake the Roman Empire worse than ever Hanniball did? and who so fill'd the World with his generous Actions, that not to have heard of him is as great a wonder as any he perform'd? This (reply'd Symander) is that same Spartacus who corneing into Italy a Slave loaden with Chaines and miseries, by his vertue and Courage had certainely subjected the greatest Empire of the World, if at least his Souldiers had bin of that Temper which Hanniballs were, For Spartacus knew as well how to make use of a victory, as to winne it, if that great Generall had done the like and had followed successe asmuch as successe did him, he had made the Carthaginians, Lords of all the World. One great advantage Hanniball had, which was though his Army were compos'd of severall Nations, yet they never mutin'd, but with asmuch satisfaction as Duty observed his orders. If my generous Master had enjoy'd that blessing, the Parthians had now held that Empire in possession, which the Carthaginians only had in expectation, as you shall heare by the sequell of my discourse. Which said Callimmachus, I must interrupt, to begg you to resolve me two doubts, the First is, why the Romans gave out that Spartacus was a Thracian? and the second, Why they said he was kill'd in that famous Battell of the Trenches, which he fought against Marcus Crassus? To satisfy your first doubt (reply'd Symander) I must acquaint you that those Thracians which gave him the Name of Spartacus, when they sawe his glorious victories, and that he would not then discover where he was borne, resolv'd since he tooke his Name out of their Language to give him his originall from their Country, which my Prince did not contradict for those Reasons I formerly specifi'd, so that the Romans when they said he was a Thracian, gave cut but that which they credditted themselvs. To your second doubt, which concearnes his supposed Death, I shall begg your patience but a litle that I may tell it you in its due order for I perceive by your Questions you are already acquainted with so much of my Princes adventures, that it will very much shorten the Relation of them. I must confesse (reply'd Callimmachus) though my profession and inclination have made me these fewe yeares live a recluse life & give me no great curiosity to enqvire after Newes, yet your generous Princes actions have reach'd my Eares but in so confus'd a way, that you will doe me a singuler fauour to acquaint me with all the perticulers, being so enamour'd of his vertue that I cannot but be highly interessed in any thing that relates unto a further knowledg of it; then begging Symanders excuse for having desir'd to anticipate his Relation, which he besought him to receive as an Argument of his great concernment in Artabbanes safety, by his silence invited him to continue his discourse, which Symander did in these words. I left off where Artabbanes vnder the name of Spartacus was chosen Captaine by his companions, which Title oblig'd him to provide for all their safetyes: His first cares were, to fortify our Forte, (which he did by makeing many Traverses upon the Advenues) and to procure a Magazine of Victualls which at last he accomplisht, but with much difficulty, being constrayned to fight for every thing he brought in; The Capuans too, were takeing order for their safetyes, and having found by their first essay, that 'twas not an easy thing to conquer us in the feild, but farre more hardly to be effected in the strong Forte wee were in, having furnisht it with all necessaries for three Months, dispatcht away some of their Cittizens to Rome to acquaint the Senate with what was past, and to implore their ayde for the suppressing of their Bondmen (for so they alwayes termed us). The Senate takeing their motion into debate, and findeing how great prejudice all Italy had receiv'd by the Slaves that were risen in Sicily (which were not then quite supprest) how that from a weake beginning, they had made a dangerous progresse, & that it would bring their Fame and their Empire into contempt, when that their very Slaves could endanger both, resolv'd for this expedition to employ Clodius the Pretor, with 3000 men, who having receiv'd his Commission (which was to put us all to the Sword) left Rome, and by great Marches advanc'd towards us, wee were not ignorant of these preparations by the industry of Casttus (who knoweing the Country, was employ'd as a spye, and 'till wee were beseidg'd, brought us frequent and true Intelligences; but at last the Pretor and his Army (which was recruited by some additionall forces out of Capua) were come so neere us that they drew up in Battalia, and faced our Forte. Spartacus who was resolv'd to make them dispute every foote of ground, made some such vigorous sallyes that the Romans were hinder'd from Campeing above 24. howers, and had our Numbers bin equall to our Resolutions, wee had made our Enemyes knowe, that those they had to deale with, had nothing of Slaves but the Name. My Prince having acquainted Clodius by the losse of 200 of his souldiers of what temper we were made, gave him leave to settle his Campe, least he might harrasse his owne Men more then the Enemyes. The Pretor who understood the Arte of Warre, & knew the Truth of this Maxime, That a place strong by scituation is easily blockt up, elected that way of conquering us; But since I have so many things of Souldiery to acquaint you with, I must runn them over breifely, by telling you, That though the season of the Yeare were very incommodious to lodge in the open Ayre, yet the Romans having endur'd a world of Miseries by the fury of the weather, would not (for all) decline their seidge, but by the continuance of it reduced us to that extreamity for want of Victualls, that we resolv'd, rather than suffer the torments of Famine, to fall upon all the Army, and with our Swords in our hands, dye acting our Revenge, which determination wee had the next morning put in practice, had not I found out a strange way for our deliverance, for the Euening preceding that day, in which we resolv'd to performe our desperate enterprize, as I was lookeing over our Forte, I tooke notice of certaine wilde Vines, that grewe upon the side of the Rocks, so thick, and in such abundance, that I begann to fancy it noe very difficult thing, by their helpe, & our owne industry to gett downe into the Plaine. This Immagination I instantly communicated to Spartacus & to the rest, who haveing viewed the place were all of my opinion, wee therefore begann to make ladders, like those in Shipps, for the Vines being supple, of a great length, and Strong, were almost as usefull as Ropes, and the Rocks not makeing one continued precipice, but in some places resembling scaffolds and Stages, did so facilitate our attempt, that two howers before Day, we all safely descended on the Playne, my Generous Master having leadd us the way, which was alwayes his practice, where there was any danger. Then as we were goeing to advise with Castus what way to take to recover the Mountaine, My Prince over-heareing it came, and begg'd us to make use of no other Guide but him, and to take no other way but that which lead to the Roman Campe, where a Victory as certaine as it would be glorious did attend us: In a word, he told us so many Arguments for embraceing so happy an opportunity, that they preferr'd the honor of the attempt before their owne safety, and obeyed Spartacus, who leadeing them some Tenn furlongs about, fell into Clodius Campe, & found them so vuprepar'd (for thy kept noe Centryes but towards the Advenues of our Forte having all Italy to freind besides) that wee kill'd above 500 of them in their hutts before they tooke the Allarum, which at last was so hott (not knowing from whence so great an execution proceeded) that Clodius, and all those-that scap't the fury of our Swords, were oblig'd to their feete for their safetyes & left us the quiet possession of their Campe, with all the Riches, Victualls, and Armes in it. The reporte of this great successe was so suddenly dispers'd, that in lesse than Tenn dayes aboue 1000. aswell Slaves as discontented and poore Men, came to offer their service to my Prince, who willingly receiv'd them, and gave Armes to such as wanted any out of those he had taken from the Pretor, But Spartacus having no banck of Treasure to maintaine such a confluence of People as every day came thronging under his Ensign's, and knowing that to live upon the spoyle was as dishonest as vnpolitick, and would so scatter his Army, that the Romans could not misse an occasion of destroying it, publish't that if the Country would send him in a competent proportion of Victualls and mony, they should receive noe prejudice, but if they neglected so favourable an offer, whatsoever Miseries they suffer'd by it, must be cast upon the scoare of their obstinacy. This in some places prevail'd, but in others it did not, those enjoyed the effects of his clemency and these resented the reward of their wilfullnes. But to confine my selfe to my engagement of running over breifly all my Princes generous Actions in this Warre, I will acquaint you, that the Romans after the defeate of Clodius, sent Varinus the Pretor with 8000 men against Spartacus, and because his Army was to be formed out of severall Garrisons, which of necessity would take up some Tyme, he sent Furius, his Leiutenant with 2000 Souldiers before him to preserue the Country from our Incursions, which my Prince having intelligence of, drew out 1000. of his select Men, & martch't all Night with them towards a Valley which Furius was to passe thorough next morning, and their an hower before day, in two small Groues about a Furlong assunder, he lodg'd his party. Wee had not long continu'd in expectation of our Enemyes but wee sawe Furius in the head of his Army marching in very good order which Spartacus soone broke, for discovering himselfe with 600. of his Souldiers he gave the Romans so resolute and vnexpected a charge, that at first he discompos'd them, But Furius who perceiv'd how vnconsiderable our numbers were, soone rallyed his men, and then gave us so vigorous a repayment that wee found it high tyme to give the the signall for Canitius and Castus with those 400 men that were yet in oae of the Groves for our Reserue, which no sooner appear'd than the Enemy fledd, not knowing but every wood might be so furnisht. The Country being very fitt to follow the execution there escaped not above 100 in all, of which number Furius was none who scorning to owe his safety to his flight thrust himselfe into the midst of us, and there found that Fate which Spartacus endeavour'd to prevent, but the eagernesse of his Souldiers was such that he could only oblige him in designe and not in Action, yet after his Death, he gave him a Buriall suitable to the esteeme he had conceiv'd of his Courage. This defeate increast our Army much more than the Romans lost in it, & the Senate no sooner heard of it but they resolv'd by a powerfull Force to pluck upp this Warre by the Rootes and not to send inconsiderable Numbers against us which did but serve to increase our Reputation & eclipse their owne. In order to which they gave Cossinius the Command of 10000 men, and joyn'd him in Commission with Varinus, who by this was recruited with more than Furius had lost. Spartacus quickly found that if these two Armyes should joyne, 'twould be difficult if not impossible any longer to maintaine a Warre, and therefore was projecting some way to avoyde this storme, but fancy'd none so probable as by taking the feild which might furnish him with an occasion to fight with them assunder. His Army then consisting of 8000. he marcht directly towards Varinus, who lay encamp't threescore Furlongs from our Forte in expectation of his Colleagve who had then newly left Rome. My Prince having faced his Campe invited him out of it, and by many other wayes endeavour'd to provoke him to Battell, but when he perceiv'd all was fruitlesse, he intrencht himselfe eight Furlongs from the Pretor, gave out that his men rann away dayly, and for foure Nights successively kept great Fires in his Campe, and permitted none of his Souldiers to appeare without nor within his Trenches. The first Night having advertisement that Cossinius was within a litle dayes march of Varinus, with asmuch silence as an Army could rise he quitt his Campe, leaveing some fewe to continue those accustomed Fires in it, and march't all Night towards Cossinius, whose Scouts being taken by some of ours, after a few threatnings confest that their Generall was not then in his Campe but lay at a small Village not farre distant from it to make use of certaine Bath's which were there. Spartacus immediately sent Castus with a commanded party of select Horse to surprize him, and continu'd his martch towards the Enemy, but Cossinius gott the Allarme tyme-enough to recover to his Campe, which he was no sooner come into than our Army stormed it and after a bloody resistance entred, There Cossinius obserueing how my Prince peirc'd & broke his resolutest Troopes had the cofidence to fight with him which cost him his Life, His fall was noe sooner divulg'd but all his Army sought their security in their Feete haveing found their Swords were vnable to give it them, some 2000. escap't, the rest were kill'd, and a fewe taken. The day by this tyme appear'd and shew'd our Souldiers, that the Riches they had purchast by the Victory was as greate as the honor. Haveing rested & refreshed themselves a while, the next Night wee return'd to our owne Campe, where we found how well Varinus had bin deluded by our Fires and our Souldiers not shewing themselves the Five precedent Dayes. This Sir (continued Symander) is so strange, that were it not as generall a knowne Truth I should not have the confidence to tell it you. The next morning after our returne, Spartacus sent 500. Prisoners (taken at Cossinius defeate) unto Varinus and bidd them tell him, though the Romans usage to him and their barbarous Commissions they gave their Generalls of shewing noe mercy deserved in Iustice a proportionate returne, yet he esteem'd an ill action fitter to be avoyded than immitated, therefore presented him those Captives, having only exacted an oath from them, of not bearing Armes against him for a yeare. 'Twere hard to tell the severall conjecturs our Enemyes had in their Campe when they perceiv'd those 500. unarmed Men march up to them, but 'twere farre more difficult to describe their greife when they knew the Cause of it. The rage of this defeate and the confidence Varinus had of not being releiv'd, made him alter that cold Resolution of protracting the Warre & by erecting a scarlett Coate-Armour over his Tent (which is the Romans signall of Battell) gave us asmuch joy as our successe did afterwards afford him discontent. But his fury not haveing absolutely blinded his Iudgement he drew up his Army in so advantagious a place that he might retire safely into his Campe if he found the Victory inclin'd to our side, which precaution he soone made use of, and by it deferr'd his ruine for a fewe dayes which afterwards happen'd neere Salapia a considerable Towne in the East parte of Italy, where the successe was so entire that not above 1500. escaped, in which number Varinus was, haveing lost his Axes & Rodds the Badges of his Pretorship with the officers that carryed them, to whome Spartacus soone restor'd them and them to their liberty, but our Army commanded them to tell the Senate That their Generall would not make use of the Regalia's 'till he had the Empire too. Amongst those Prisoners then taken, there was some young Men of Salapia, who thinking to have a share in Varinus Victory were (the day before his defeate) come into his Army, and findeing so different a Fortune to that which they expected desir'd to speake with Spartacus, where they tould him, that Salapia was without any Garrison, that the cheifest Cittizens in it were their Freinds and Kindred, & such with whome thy had much power, which they would employ for the reduceing of it into his hands if he would restore them their Freedome and engage his Faith that their Towne & Townsmen should enjoy the same immunities and priviledges under him that they did under the Romans, in a word they so represented the Terror the Salapians were in, and the Interest they had in them, that Spartacus graunted unto them whatsoever they desir'd and immediatly martch't directly thither. That which induc'd those Prisoners to make that overture was, that some of our Officers in their discourse had not only assur'd them that the first designe wee should goe upon was to take in their Citty, but that they themselves must expect the Last rigour of Warre if they did not contribute their assistance in the reduceing of it, which if they would vndertake and performe might not only be a singuler advantage to Salapia, but preserve their owne Lives which were so justly forfeicted to the Law of Armes. These Men through such like infusions were so terrifyed, that partly out of relation to themselves, and partly out of care of their Towne which (without yeelding) by the greatnesse of our Army (then indeed growne very considerable) must become in fewe dayes a prey to the insolent Souldier) inclin'd them to that motion, which was the cause of furnishing my Prince with an occasion to serve two of the most vertuous Lovers That Tyme did produce, and in obligeing them, he received a farre higher satisfaction, than by takeing of so important a place. By this our Army haveing fac'd Salapia, halfe those young men, were permited to trye their power, the other halfe remaineing as hostages for them, and truely they were so successefull in the attempt, haveing terrified the Salapians with the vastnesse of our Forces (which impressions they were apt enough to receive by the blooddy defeate of Varinus the Pretor) that immediatly they deputed some of the cheifest Cittizens to treate with my Prince for the conditions of their surrender, and had so farre advanc'd the worke that every thing was on the point of conclusion when a Messenger from the Towne, desireing and being admitted to speake with the Deputyes, whisper'd them something in the Eare, after which they all begg'd leave of Spartacus to returne for a while, there being in their absence some Tumults happen'd amongst their Salapians which nothing but their presence could appease, which being graunted, and they not a Quarter of an houer return'd, but those young Men that were employ'd into Salapia were sent back into the Campe, all the Walls Mann'd, and a blooddy Colours hung out, of which so sudden an alteration we could not immagin the Cause 'till those Prisoners told us, that during the Treaty a young Gentleman called Perolla, who under the Romas had purchast much Glory, had by an oration so perswaded the Salapians, that they were resolv'd rather to hazard their ruine by resistance than purchase the avoyding of it by a submission, that the Cittizens haveing taken up that determination would have detain'd them, least Spartacus insenced by their inconstancy, might inflict the Punishment of it on them: against which they represented the injustice of the action, the certaine Death of their Companions, and how 'twould give one that had the power, the will to destroy Salapia, but finding all their reasons rejected, they went to Perrolla, whose Gallantry they said was as great as his Courage, & having acquainted him with the conditions on which they were sent into Salapia & their desires, he not only highly commended their honesty, but gave strict order they should returne to the Campe, which no one durst oppose, all of them haveing trusted him for the tyme being with the absolute Command. Wee soone found by this Relation the occasion of so sudden a change, and that Salapia must be purchast with asmuch difficulty as a litle before wee were perswaded to have obtained it with ease. But Spartacus haveing fac't it found himselfe bound in honor to make them repent the contemning of his Mercy, & therefore instantly secureing all the Advenues, he gave directions for many scalling Ladders Rowleing Bridges and Faggotts to be forthwith provided, Then calling for all the Salapians who were 50. in Number he told them, That he was sorry their Cittizens had deluded him, but 'twas only in relation to themselves, since it would render their destruction as just as it was inevitable, That to Conquer so considerable a Place was more for his honor than to have it given him, That he had endeavour'd to make them yeeld by faire meanes because he preferr'd the saveing of blood before the Glory of his Army, That for their owne perticulers, their declineing the Temptations of their freinds and returneing to his Campe when they could not but doubt his resentment, was a strong proofe of their Gallantry or of the high opinion they had of his, either of which causes were equally obligeing, That by the caracter they had given him of Perolla, he was more ambitious to have him for a Freind than an Enemy, but would not desire that happinesse then, least it might deprive him of a certaine Victory: That he so much valued vertue (though in his Enemyes) that least Perolla's might not be well seconded, he gave them all (aswell for his sake as for their owne) their liberty, and leave to employ it in his service for the defence of Salapia, which he assur'd them would be all litle enough against an Army on whome victory did as constantly as justly attend. The Salapians who expected a quite contrary entertainment, after many expressions of their Ioy and gratitude reply'd, That if upon their returne they could not perswade their Cittizens to yeeld unto so generous a Conqueror; that yet at least upon their Ramparts they would confirme the good opinion he had of their Courages, and either make his Victory worthy that Name, or his defeate the more excusable by their resistance. Spartacus extreamly pleas'd with this answer assur'd them, that he would in very fewe dayes summon them of their promise, & observe if they would satisfy this last enguagement as punctually as they had their first, which if they did, he would confesse in giveing them their freedome he had more oblig'd himselfe than them. These young Men being come to Salapia, so magnifi'd my Prince unto Perolla, that he knew not whither the misfortune was greater in haveing so much vertue to his Enemy, or the happinesse in haveing so ample an occasion of Glory. Two dayes were past in light skirmishes whilst our preparations for an assault were perfected, The Third, an hower before 'twas light our Army advanc't, & every division haveing receiv'd their orders began a furious storme, which was receiv'd with an equall resolution, sixe houers together the businesse was disputed without any apparent advantage on either side, and every place fill'd with horror and blood, death being given and receiv'd in a thousand severall wayes: at last Canitius who had the command of all the Germans in the Army, planted one of our Ensignes upon the Walls, but was so suddenly repulst, that before my Prince could have tyme to commend his Courage he had cause to pitty the misfortune of it: Nyne of our severall Commanders had the same Fate that day aswell in their resolutions as misfortunes, And Spartacus perceiveing that they at last fought rather by duty than inclination, sounded a retreate, which was so redily obey'd, that the Enemy found it rather proceeded from apprehension than discipline, and therefore fell so briskly in our Reare, that it had endanger'd all the Army had not my Prince in person with 500. of the resolutest Men made head against them, and though he stopt the execution and at last made them retire, yet it was so leasurely and in such good order, that their retreate appear'd rather their election than their necessity. Spartacus haveing doubl'd his Guards, and taken strict order for the rendring ineffectuall of all Sallyes, return'd to his Tent more vnsatisfied with the repulse than with the losse, where all those Officers whose wounds permitted them, and who had that fatall day scap't Perolla's Sword came to justifie themselves, professeing that they were not more troubl'd at their disgrace than desirous the next morning to repaire it, and manifest by their Victory that the suspension of it proceeded from their want of Fortune not of Courage, or by their Death shewe whose Souldiers they were, That their affront (by a joynt concurence of all their observations) proceeded from Perolla, who was vbiquitary and knew noe certaine Post but where there was the certain'st danger which he courted with an eagernesse as great as his successe. Many other expressions they made to vindicate the affront, and to shew how willing they were to repaire it, which would be too- tedious to relate, and to which my Prince reply'd, That he was as much satisfied with the sence they had of their misfortune as troubled at the occasion of it, that according to their desires the next morning he would againe storme the Towne, and helpe them to vindicate their credits or beare a share with them in their fayler: And in pursuance of that resolution commanded them back to their severall charges, with orders as soone as the day dawn'd, that they should in the same order begin againe the storme, that the Enemy (if overcome) might acknowledge by the not altering the Assailants nor the order of the Assault that it was their Fortune only had suspended their destructions. The Officers by many expressions haveing thank't Spartacus for so high a complement plac't upon their Courages, were retireing when there came in News, that Granicus with most of those others which we thought had bin kill'd by the Salapians were comeing to my Prince, who extreamly surpriz'd at the accident, sent for them in, Granicus therefore (with six score of his Companions) immediatly presented himselfe & told him, After the Assault Sir was ended, Perolla commanded all the Prisoners to be brought unto him, and haveing learn't that I was of the most considerable quallity amongst them, addrest himselfe vnto me and spoke to this effect. That liberty which both you and your Companions have lost by my better fortune, I here againe restore you, and for your ransome I shall only desire you to tell the Generous Spartacus, I am exceedingly troubl'd that he has so much cause to looke upon this action, as an expression of gratitude and not of that Affection his Gallantry has created in me; & though his usage to the Salapians he sent me expects this as a just retribution, yet the high opinion I have of his vertue, was no way an inferiour motive: tell him besides, that those whose wounds will not permit them to goe off with you, shall receive an entertainment which shall speake the opinion I have of their Generall, that their healths and libertyes shalbe the same thing, & that I almost thinke it a misfortune to defend my Country since by it I am necessitated to be his Enemy. This high Generosity had so powerfull an influence on my Prince, that had not his honor bin so deeply engag'd, he had rais'd the Seidge, and would have thought it more glorious to decline fighting against so gallant and civill an Enemy than to have conquer'd him; but that Tyrant which binds us to follow other mens opinions more than our owne, forc't him to continue his former designe of stormeing Salapia next morning, & I dare truely affirme, the desire he had of takeing so considerable a place was more prevalent with him out of an expectation that thereby he might evince himselfe worthy Perolla's frendship and finde an occasion to oblige him, than any other cosideration whatsoever; which least the fury of his Souldiers might prevent, he assur'd those that could save the Generous Perolla's Life should have a more considerable reward then his Ransome. The day no sooner appear'd but Castus began the Assault on the East side of the Citty, & Canitius with his German son the West where Spartacus himselfe was, who perceiving many of his Men kill'd and the rest extremely shaken, to avoyd the precedent Dayes Fate, tooke up his owne Collours and cryed out, Those that love their honor or their Generall let them follow me, then marching a round pace thorough Canitius men that were flying, he came against a Clowde of Arrowes to the Foote of the Wall, where erecting some scalling-Ladders he resolutely & successfully clymb'd up, and after a blooddy dispute beate off the Defendants and planted that Colours he had in his hand upon the Rampire; I had the honor to be the neerest to him in this action, where he did so many noble exployts that Fortune must have bin as vnjust as they say shee is inconstant, had shee refus'd him this Victory. No sooner had our Army perceiu'd how easy a passage my Prince had made, then above 6000. of them enter'd by that way, and without shedding any more blood renderd themselves absolute Masters of the Citty, but whilst Spartacus was takeing order to preserve the Salapians asmuch as in such an occasion was possible, and that he had dispers'd many of his Officers, and I with them to doe the like, as I was goeing thorough one of the fairest streetes, I sawe a greate confluence of Souldiers about a house whose structure sufficiently spoake the magnifficence of the Owner, and being come thither, I enquir'd what was the cause of it, one of the Officers soone inform'd me, that a Company of young Gentlemen only considerable for their Resolutions, had made so generous a defence, and so slighted all Quarter, that they were necessitated to make use of Numbers to suppresse them, and that now at last they had kill'd all the Defendants but one, who haveing gain'd a narrow staire-case, was yet makeing of it good with so much Courage, that he deplor'd the destroying asmuch as the effects of it, and that he vnderstood this generous Mans name was Perolla: You may easily immagin, the hearing of that Name gave me an vnexpressible desire to save the Master of it, & having conjur'd the Officer to runn and acquaint Spartacus with it I thrust my selfe into the crowde, and by many actions which shew'd my concernement and haste, commanded them in Spartacus's Name to forbeare any further attempt against so generous an Enemy, This order found a reddy obedience, aswell out of the knowledge they had of the Affection my deere Master honor'd me with, as out of a desire to preserve Perolla, who they now fought against rather to shew that an Army might kill him than out of any designe they had to doe so. At last by the helpe of our Officers I came to the place where the gallant Perolla stood, who appear'd to me to be lesse weary with conquering than our Souldiers were with assaulting him, and 'spight of that blood which endeavour'd to disfigure his Face, I perceiv'd a Countenance so spirituall and so lovely together, that I knew not which most to admire, but my wonder was quickly raisd to a higher pitch by the sight of a Lady, who possest the severall bautyes of shape stature complexion & Features in so inaccessionall a degree, that an Affection for her could not so properly be called Passion as Reason. The contemplation of so many perfections had almost made me forget the designe I was come for, which fault I soone repair'd by addressing my selfe to the Generous Perolla and telling him. The great Spartacus (Sir) who cherrishes vertue where ever it is plac't, has sent me hither to preserve so great a possessor of it as you are, for he beleives your Gallantry is a stronger obligation on him to serve you, than your employing of it against him is to make him your Enemy. Since (reply'd Perolla) that is your Generalls principle, the faire Izadora here is a worthy object to employ that generosity on, which I beleive you cannot doubt when I assure you, that her exteriour parts are as farre short of the beautyes of her Mind as the passion I pay hir is vnworthy the object: for her sake I can begg though not for my owne, and will acknowldg your civillity as great as your courages if you will promise me shee shall receive an vsage as proportionate to her Meritt as you can possibly pay her: this enguagment wilbe more obligeing farre than my owne safety, & make that Death which my sadd Fate now renders necessary as full of happinesse as such a deprivation is capable off. As I was about to answer him I was hinder'd by a great noyse, which turning about to discover the cause of, I perceiv'd it was my Prince, who with incredible haste was breaking through the Croude, and came tym-enough to see the perfect Izadora fling her selfe at her Lovers Feete, and tell him, Alas Perolla! cann you talke of happinesse in Death and yet thinke of leaving me behinde you? did you ever finde any felicity in separation, that you begg it even of your very Enemyes? or have you so lowe an opinion of my Passion, as to thinke I can survive you? Ah Madam (said Perolla interrupting and puting himselfe in her Posture) if you will lessen my trouble, give me rather markes of your disdaine than of your Love? since the Vastnesse of that score now creates my sufferings, which are so great they cannot be increast but by new additions of your favour: judge then if it be not tyme to dye when my highest blessing, that of your Affection, proves my Torment. Then (reply'd Izadora) my condition will asmuch require Death as yours, for 'tis as impossible for me not to augment your sufferings whilst I live as 'tis for to survive you, which since my sorrow will not permitt, let my Love anticipate the effects of it: this wilbe more proportionate to my vowes, and cut off the tortures of a lingring Life, so Death the enemy to other Passions may prove the freind of ours, and conferr that vnion on us in the other Life which our Fates and cruell Parents have deny'd us in this. Izadora (said Perolla) flatter not my hopes with an vnion in the other World, the Gods which hel'd me vnworthy of you here, will have much more cause to continue that beleife, when insteed of your mortality they shall cloath you with the reward of vertue, alas, then you wilbe fitter for their adoration then myne. Can there be (shee reply'd) a felicity in the other World for Izadora if shee be divided from Perolla? doe not by such suggestions fright me into a hatred of Elizium, which, if what you say be true will lose its quality, and fancy not the Gods vnjust only to make us miserable, no Perolla, wee have walk't too exactly in the Path's of vertue to feare Death, and as an argument of this truth, that minute which separates your Soule from the faire Mansion it now inhabits, shall give mine freedome: for, to dye is a blessing or a curse, if the first, I will not be deny'd it too, if the latter I hope 'twill hinder your despaire when you know I will involue my selfe in it. This noble dispute had continu'd longer had I not told Perolla that Spartacus was come, who indeed was so ravisht with the vertue of these Lovers that his admiration made many who knew him not, suspect that his suspence proceeded from his being as absolutly vanquisht by the Eyes of one of his Enemyes as his Sword had bin victorious over all the rest; But Parthenissa was too-deeply fixt to be defac't, & her Beauty had gott so absolute an Empire over Artabbanes heart, that since her inconstancy could not destroy it, nothing else could have that power, But the Lookers-onn, who tooke his affection to vertue to be a Passion of another quallity, were not long in that error, for Izadora who perceiv'd Perolla's great heart could not make any desires to my Prince, esteem'd it an action fitter for her Sexe to vndertake, and addressing herselfe to him, put him out of those raptures their gallantry only had created, by saying, Generous Spartacus, did not that Title assure me you will receive a greater contentment in giving Perolla his Life than he can resent by receiving it, and that I furnish you with an occasion to oblige yourselfe more than him, I should now have bin silent, and joyfully participate in his Fate rather than be indebted for his preservation to a lesse noble Enemy, but your Gallantry is such, that the cause of his being conquer'd takes away all resentment from the effect. Izadora had continv'd speaking but that her gallant Lover interrupted her by crying out, oh Madam! can you thinke Perolla will live after he ha's bin so vnworthy and miserable as to obtaine your safety by his Prayers whilst he had a Sword to purchase it? add not so much to my misfortunes, as to make your Affection the cause of all those Torments I must hereafter suffer should I now live; No Izadora my death shall shew that nothing but the desire of your safety could have induc'd me so long to survive my honor. Finishing those words, he had flung himselfe upon the point of his Sword, had not my Prince (gessing at what he meant) rann to him, and though it were tyme enough to hinder his fatall determination, yet it could not prevent a slight wound which manifested his sadd intention. Izadora on the other side thinkeing Perolla had bin his owne Executioner, resolv'd to beare him company, and with a Courage which disdain'd exclaimeing against Fate, drew out a Ponyard which shee had conceal'd for some such desperate exigency, and cry'd out, this stroake Perolla shall prove more kind than you, and give us that vnion you would so cruelly deprive me off: then lifting up that fatall weapon, shee had (doubtlesse) perform'd what shee spoake, but that by thrusting away her hand I made that wound light upon her Arme which shee intended for her Heart, but having mist her aime shee was goeing to double her stroake had not I forced the Ponyard from her. Whilst I was thus employ'd Spartacus obtayn'd an easy conquest over Perolla, who no sooner heard his faire Mistrisses cruell determination, than the bare sound of her death banisht all thoughts of his owne, and having perceiv'd the service I had render'd him, he flung himselfe at her Feete and told her, I will Live Madam since this wretched life is so deare unto you, and on that score I shall cherrish it as much as I should detest it upon any other: judge Izadora then how pretious your Life is to me, since to continue it I can be content to live in infamy. Live generous Perolla (said my Prince) and since the beleife of your being vanquisht is the cause of your despaire, banish that groundlesse doubt, for you are so farre from that condition, that You are the Conqueror, your vertue has made you invincible, nor was it fitt the faire Izadora should derive her safety from a lesse noble cause; I renounce all right to her preservation, and the wonders which your Sword has hitherto acted shallbe increast by this addition of remaining victorious in a Triumphant Army. Ah Sir, (reply'd Perolla) whilst you endeavour to make me a Conqueror you are doublly so, your civility acts now what your courage did before, both which are so vnresistable, that when I consider who you are I shall excuse my selfe in my misfortune, and since you attribute Miracles to my Sword, I will make it performe one, which is to yeeld it selfe up. Perolla had satisfy'd this ceremony had not Spartacus so absolutely declin'd it that all those which were present easily perceiv'd his denyall proceeded asmuch from his justice as his Civility. Whilst these two great persons were by a thousand embraces confirming that freindship which they vow'd to each other, Perolla vnfortunatly 'spy'd some blood running out of the faire Izadora's Arme, alas how fatall was that object like to prove, his passion made him act many extravagancyes, which nothing except Love could render legittimate, but when he remember'd the cause of her wound how soone was that new-created harmony desolv'd? and having againe found, that all his attempts against his life were fruitlesse, he prostrated himselfe at his faire Mistris's Feete and told her, Must I then Madam, must I then see that pretious blood shed for my sake, and at the same tyme be renderd vncapable of emptying all my veynes to beare it company and expiate my Crime? must you spill your blood to preserve my Life, whilst I make use only of Prayers to preserve yours? ah Izadora! be mercifull and permitt me by one stroake to end the Miseries which these thoughts will still create. Alas (said Izadora) ha's your rage so much blinded your iudgement, as to thinke, that what is the cause of this slight hurt if continu'd will prove its reparation; rise, rise Perolla, and beleive me, if these fewe dropps have either manifested my passion, or sau'd your Life; they are too gloriously spilt to be deplor'd, and if they create any resentments in you, they should be of a contrary nature to those which now appeare. I must confesse (continued Symander) that my memory does not retaine all the perticuler passages of so rare an entertainment, and therefore I will not so much wrong such vertuous persons as to cloath their conceptions and expressions in any other language than their owne; I will therefore in expectation of your pardon for so high an omission continue my discourse, by acquainting you, that after a freindship was contracted, which was as perfect as the freinds themselves were, that Perolla's despaire was absolutely conquer'd, & that his and his Izdora's wounds were drest, my Prince inuited them to his Quarters out of that Massacre and deludge of blood which his new freind had made, and though his many wounds render'd the least motion both dangerous and painfull, yet he thought the greatest Torments would be found in his separation from the faire Izadora, and therefore having made his paine appeare the lesse to make his happinesse really the greater, he assur'd my Prince, that without any inconveniency he could waite upon her and him to those lodgeings he had assign'd her, whither as they were goeing, they might perceive some barbarous Souldiers driveing before them two Gentlemen, whose Age and countenace meritted a different usage (though their past actions did not) and I dare avowe, though their sufferings were great, and that the manner in which they were inflicted was as sensible as the paine; yet they did beare them with much joy, for each of them by the knowledg of his owne usage guessing at that of his Enemyes, found his satisfaction in his very torment. But they were no sooner perceiv'd by Izadora and Perolla than both of them with many Teares and passionate actions begg'd my Prince that their Irons might be taken off, which was no sooner motion'd than graunted, though those which kept them alleadg'd that they were the Men which had spilt most of their Companions blood at the Assault: Then my deere Master desir'd Perolla to acquaint him what high relation could produce such rare demonstrations of affection as he exprest at their Captivity? to which he reply'd, Sir I must acknowledge, that Gentleman (shewing Blacius) to be the faire Izadora's Father, and the other (shewing Pacuvius) to be mine, though truely they have retain'd nothing but the name and the power of Parents, they are those which we have reason to hate and yet cannot, and though they have stifl'd all the dictats of Nature, & oppos'd the purest Flame that ever burn'd; yet we preserve our dutyes to them so entire, that wee resent any affliction which befalls them, with a greife proportionable to their joy if the selfesame accidents had ariu'd to us. Spartacus being inform'd of their qualityes saluted them with much respect; but he perceiv'd, as soone as they had learn'd to whose intercession they owed that favour, that the meanes of their deliverance supprest the contentment of it. This action made him extreamely admire, what strange causes they were which could have so vnusuall an operation, and haveing found at last that each of them rely'd upon the justice of his cause, he desir'd to heare their difference, to which the Fathers willingly consented, as being confident in their right, and haveing heard a true caracter of my Prince's justice, as on the other side Izadora & Perolla willingly submitted to it on the same grounds; The next morning then being appointed for this audience, my Prince having conducted our vertuous Lovers to his owne Quarters, which when he had surrender'd them, & there (as a marke of his confidence and freindship) acquainted Perolla with the Word, he withdrew himselfe to settle & secure his new Conquest, leaving them in as high an admiration of his Gallantry, as he had conceiv'd of theirs. The next Day was not many houres old but he was inform'd by the Messenger he had sent to Complement the generous Lovers, that they expected with much impatiency the Iudge of their felicity or Misery, to satisfye their longing he waited immediatly on them, bringing with him their Fathers, where findeing by the Chirurgions that so long a discourse as their Fortunes must amount unto might prejudice Perolla's health, they pevail'd with Izadora to undertake the Relation, which a generall silence inviting her to performe, shee begann it in these words. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PARTE THE FOVRTH BOOKE. that their Hatred is not a purchast but an hereditary one, and beares so auncient a date that the originall cause of it is as absolutely forgotten as the sadd effects it ha's produced are recent, that what was but passion or resentment in the Beginners of this Fatall differece, has turn'd to nature in their Children, that our Parents have inherited their Predecessors malice aswell as their Estates, and as if Fortune had hitherto afforded instruments to nourish this sadd difference, in seaven descents successively our Auncestors have allwayes left Heires males to perpetuate this quarrell, whereby many of our Familyes have sacrific'd their Lives to the blinde rage of the Authors of them: but at last the Gods having given Pacuvius no other Heire then the generous Perolla, and Blacius than the vnfortunate Izadora, all those which were concern'd in these domestick differences began to make it their hopes aswell as 'twas their prayers, that by an vnion of us Two, this auncient Animossity might be extinguish't, but alas the higher Powers it seemes had othewise decreed, For Blacius more troubl'd that he wanted a Sonne to inherit his batred than his Estate, immagin'd (since my Sexe exempted me from those violent resentments which he held so necessary to his blood) he ought to collect in himselfe all the resentments of those which should have succeeded him, and act some designe suitable to his hatred  & despaire, that the effects of it might be alwayes recent enough in Perolla's Family to supply the expiration of his owne. (Pardon me Sir, said Izadora addressing herselfe to her Father, if I speak those words which you have your selfe so often reitterated) And on the other side Pacuvius seeing but one man of his Enemyes alive, resolv'd to be reveng'd on Him in such a way, that the manner of his death should be as deplorable to his Freinds as the very extinction of his Family. (I must begg your Pardon too Sir, said Izadora addressing herselfe to Pacuvius) because you are the Father of my Perolla, though what I say your professions aswell as actions have endeavourd aboundantly to justifie. These Sir (continu'd Izadora speaking to Spartacus) were the reasonings & resolutions of our Parents when Perolla and I were in an Age as innocent as that wee now are in is miserable, & as a further evincement of their hatred I have bin often told, that Blacius was angry with Nature for haveing giuen me this litle Beauty least it might tempt Perolla, and Pacuvius was the like at the inevitable charmes of his vertuous Sonne, least they should raise in me a Passion which might create that vnion they so abundantly fear'd, therefore what education they thought fitt to give us was in private, in which if we made any Progresse, Pacuvius and Blacius thought it as great an injury to have it publisht as others Parents would to have had it conceal'd. Iudge (Sir) on the one side, if ever there could be a higher hatred than that which subverted the dictat's of blood and nature, & (on the other) if there could be a greater Affection than what converted antipathy into sympathy. I must (before I proceede any further) acquaint you, That though Salapia & Capua be neere 30. Miles distant, yet Pacuvius has a vast Estate there aswell as here, and as if all things had contributed to nourish the distraction of our Familyes, Blacius has the like there too, least (as I beleive) by being separated their rage might want that Flame which the sight of each did inspire. To hinder me therefore from the knowledge of Perolla's increaceing excellencies, Pacuvius sent him to Capua and remou'd thither himselfe shortly after, where whilst his gallant Sonne was making a large proficiency in all those reallityes and ornaments which have since made him the greatest glory of our Tymes, Hanniball, that victorious Captaine who had made Spaine his first Conquest for the Carthaginians, vndertooke Italy should be the next, and haveing past such dangers which to beleive is almost as hard as to have overcome them, and suffer'd miseries to invade the Romans which no nation else would have vndergon but to have avoyded them, he at last scal'd the Walls of Italy (the Alpes) which was indeed a very strange thing, most men beleiving it as difficult a taske to enter this Country that way as to subdue it when gotten in, and haveing with Fire and vinegar made wayes where Natures selfe had deny'd them, in fower severall Battells at Tisinum, Trebia, Thrasimene and Cannes, vanquisht the Consulls Publius Cornelius Scipio, Sempronius Longus, Caius Flamminius, Terentius Varro, & Paulus Æmilus, whose defeates invited the Attelanians, the Calatinians, the Samnites, the Brutians, the Lucanians, and divers other people of Italy to submit to that Yoake they esteem'd it impossible to resist, & had that great Captaine followed Maharball's (the Generall of his Horse) advice, & marched directly to Rome, he had without all dispute possest himselfe of that tryumphant Citty which since ha's given Lawes to those that might have impos'd theirs on her, But haveing mist his oportunity, and thereby the Romans having chang'd their feares into nobler Passions, he apply'd himselfe wholly to the Conquest of Capua (the second Rome) where Pacuvius hatred to Blacius soone furnisht Hanniball with an oportunity proportionable to his desires: for my Father has bin alwayes so inviolable a Freind to the Romans, that he almost rejoyc'd at their Defeates, since they furnisht him with an occasion to justifie he was ty'd to Them not to their prosperity, and though Pacuvius were very much their Freind, yet he was much more his Revenge's, which Passion was so predominant, that it made him act things both his reason and interest condemn'd, and which no other consideration could have seduced him to. To confirme this Truth when he found that Blacius was vnalterable to this Empire, and that their probable ruine did rather confirme than shake him, he resolv'd under an appearance of securing himselfe and Capua to ruine my Father, to which action he was the apter to incline by Hanniballs Letters, which assur'd him, if by his power Capua were deliver'd into his, the Cittizens should finde no alterations but the difference of their Protectors, which small change should be recompenc'd sufficiently with many Immunityes the Romans had deny'd them, & that for his owne perticular, he would make him no positive offers, since that were to confine to certaine Articles the Recompence of his merit, and put limmits to those Rewards which he resolv'd should have none. I must doe Pacuvius that right as to professe I beleive, though these glittering promises advanc'd the putting his designe in execution, yet his Revenge was the only cause of it, which made him determine rather to ruine his Country and Enemy together than preserve both. Alas, what miserable events ha's that blinde fury produc'd? & how has it darken'd those many other vertues which would else so cleerely shine in our Fathers. The faire Izadora could not speake these words without shedding some Teares, which did not only abundantly manifest the goodnesse of her disposition, but asmuch prov'd that Greife it selfe when it dwelt in her Face could not but relish of the place in which it resided: but this disorder being vanquisht shee thus continu'd. Pacuvius had no sooner receiv'd Hanniballs Letters than he assembl'd the cheifest of Capua (where Blacius then was) and by too-great an eloquence for so ill a subject, so represented the forlorne condition of the Romans: the tryumphant one of the Carthaginians: the advantages of accepting the Conquerors offers: and the Miseries of declineing them: that at last the Capuans feares & Hanniballs Armyes advanceing to beseidge them helping his distructive Oratory, all the Cittizens resolv'd to buy their safety by the losse of their Faiths, and to present their new Master with their Keyes and liberty: and though Blacius by a world of Arguments endeavour'd to divert so fatall a determination, yet all the advantage he deriv'd from it was, to manifest his Affection to the Romans, and to make it evident that the Capuans submiting to the Carthaginians was an action as opposite to reason as honesty Magius also my Fathers Brother (betwixt whome there was alwayes as great a difference in humours as neerenesse in blood) in this designe joyn'd with Blacius but to noe effect, the Capuans having shutt their Eares to all motions but those of becomeing Slaves to Hannibal, who being informed by Pacuvius that Capua was at his devotion made into it a triumphant entry, many Thousands of people resorting thither to behold that Man in whome such vertue dwelt, & upon whome Fortune so constantly attended, that whilst his Courage was subdueing his Enemyes in one place his Fame effected the like in another. But whist these Solemnityes were performeing Blacius withdrew himselfe into this Citty, more out of apprehensio that his death would be pleasing to Pacuvius than to decline sacrificeing himselfe for the Roman Eempire: but Magius Continu'd still at Capua, and his Councells being told to Hanniball by Perola's Father, so exasperated him, that as a testimony of his fury and power he demanded Magius of the Senate, whose feare clouding their Iustice deliver'd him up, and who immediatly he caus'd to be executed in the Market-place. For this Death Hanniballs Cruelty was not so much condemn'd as Pacuvius, whose hatred to our blood was so exorbitant, that though Magius did ever oppose Blacius, and was alwayes oppos'd by him, yet the being my Fathers Enemy was not so prevalent with Pacuvius to save him, as being his Brother was to condemne him: Thus by this sadd Tragedy the Capuans found sufficient Cause to repent, though not to repayre their inconstancy. But now (Sir) I shall tell you a passage which perhaps wilbe asmuch admir'd for the Gallantry as for the rarenesse of it: Hanniball, who had indeed contracted a reall Freindship with Pacuvius, either as esteemeing his interest in the Capuans necessary to confirme and augment his Conquests, or his vertues worthy that honor, or both, but as a marke of his esteeme and trust, he lodg'd in his House without the ordinary Guards which attended his Person: In the meane tyme Perolla, who allwayes had a high inclination to the people of Rome, and consequently detested his Fathers actions, began to project the death of Hanniball, in which nothing made him irresolute but the violating the Lawes of Hospitallity, & since the consequence was great of so generous a designe, it will not be amisse to acquaint you with some of his reasonings, before he elected it. What (said he to himselfe) shall I kill the upholder and Revenger of our Blood? shall his freindship to my Father be the cause of his ruiue? and shall he receive his Death from those with whome he trusts his Life? shall I to revenge the Romans, staine my owne reputation with a Murther, and Ruine my owne Family? who cannot 'scape being sacrifis'd to the Carthaginians Fury: Shall Rome owe her safety to a cause which if shee approv'd, render'd her vnworthy of it? shalt thou Kill a Conqueror whome the Gods have free'd from their owne immediate punishment (Thunder) by covering him with Lawrell: shalt thou make away an Enemy who in thus giveing thee the Power to destroy him, makes it a Crime to doe it? besides he is one who owes his Conquests only to his Courage and conduct, and if the Roman Empire be vanquisht with those Armes, shee deserues that Fate, which to oppose were to contradicte the justice of the Gods and vertue it selfe: Ah no Perolla, leave off the thoughts of such a designe, than which nothing can be a greater Crime but the performeing it. He had certainely gone away alter'd though not pleas'd with these reasons had not his good Genius inspir'd him with what you shall now heare. 'Tis true said he Hanniball is the upholder and Revenger of our Family, & therefore the performance wilbe the more glorious: what greater obligation can I put on the Romans than to ruine our Family to maintaine their Empire? had Magius bin asmuch a Freind as he was an Enemy to our blood, my designe might weare the name of Revenge, and an action of publique concernement might be stil'd the effect of a perticular hatred, so that all his favours should rather invite than diswade the attempt, which these circumstances will prove rather an impartiall justice than ingratitude. But remember Perolla how thy Countrymen branded with infamy Perpenna for having murther'd Sertorius though a Rebell to the Comonwealth, how much more will they detest thee for distroying one whose toomuch vertue and successe are his only Crimes. But then (he continu'd) why may not I suppose they did but counterfeict, since States have the same Artes, as perticuler persons, and it had bin an vnwise justice to commend that which they could not sufficiently reward: This part of Perpenna's Fate I hope will attende my attempt, which is one invitation more, for to performe what any but the Gods can reward is to sell Gallantry, besides my case wilbe nobler than his, for I cannot doubt the higher Powers so much as to deny him the freedome of his Sword to defend his Life, that if he fall, he may owe it to my Courage not my Treachery, and then I'le expose my selfe unto his Army, since to flye were to shunn Martyredome, and to out-live the fact, would shew as if I desir'd to enjoy that security, I purchace only for my Country. These and many other Arguments so fully confirm'd Perolla that he only attended an opportunity to put his resolution in practice, and though his greeene Age (being then but 18. yeares old) might have made his change from this determination appeare rather a thing incident to Youth than a want of Valour, yet he so much ador'd vertue, that he could not be vnconstant to whatsoever bore her Character. After he had with incredible impatience expected an occasion, Fortune seem'd one Night to furnish him with one, for having learn'd that Hanniball had withdrawne himselfe into his Chamber for a fewe houres to make a dispatch to his Freinds at Carthage, and that all his followers were upon the like employment to theirs; Perolla (who had alwayes free accesse unto him) was goeing to execute his designe, but it seemes the Fates would not let him by one generous action hinder himselfe from performeing many, for Pacuvius who had some intelligence then brought him of a designe the Capuans had to revenge Magius death, & to recover the freedome which that execution sufficiently shew'd they had lost, was then comeing to acquaint Hanniball with it, and in such a conjuncture of tyme that the Father & the generous Sonn mett each other at his Chamber-Dore, where Pacuvius seeing Perolla arm'd, was struck with so great an astonishment, that nothing could increase it but the knowledg of the cause, which Perolla acquainted him with, in such ravishing tearmes that his reason though not his inclination was converted, and findeing the happy operation which his Arguments produc'd, he begann to conjure his Father by all those motives he esteem'd most prevalent, that he would by some high performance regaine the Romans good opinion, which it seem'd the Gods invited him to performe by offering so favourable an opertunity to kill Hanniball, for (said he) the action is good or ill, if the first it has invitation enough in it selfe, if the latter, the people of Rome cannot doubt your conversion, since to assure them of it, you performe what is as contrary to your nature and practice, as your former Crime in delivering up Capua was repugnant to their Interest. I will not (said Izadora) trouble your patience by telling you how Perolla offer'd to relinquish to his Father the glory of the attempt, nor all those other things which you may immagin so rare a subject could furnish a judgement with that was so, since this designe by a seemeing delay receiv'd an absolute suppression, for Pacuvius who found that his generous Sonnes reasons and resolutions were not to be vanquish'd, counterfeicted to be so himselfe, and promis'd him as soone as that great Conqueror was out of his protection, he would joyne in the enterprize; in the meane while he begg'd Perolla with Teares & sighes to delay the execution of his attempt, and not to violate the lawes of hospitallity, which would be as great an offence unto the Gods, as the performeing it might be an obligation to the Romans. These and many such pressing motives vanquish'd my deare freind, especialy since the designe was not supprest but suspended, and that a small deferring would take away the seemeing aspertion of breach of trust, and so involve his Father in the execution, that he might thereby eface his former iniuries to the Romans. But Perolla was no sooner retir'd, than Pacuvius went in to Hanniball, and inform'd him that the Capuans were so highly inscenc'd at the Death of Magius, that he besought his permission to leave him his whole House, and that he would fill it with his Guards, lest the World might loose its greatst Glory, and he his best Freind. At last Hanniball consented to Pacuvius request, who the next morning remov'd, and whose house was immediatly so throng'd with Souldiers, that th'impossibility of attempting against that famous Captaines Life, was as great as the distroying it had bin pleasing to Perolla, who findeing how much his Father had abus'd him, resolv'd in himselfe to goe to the Romans, and by the gallantry of his Actions manifest that 'twas Pacuvius, and not Pacuvius blood which was an Enemy to their Empire, with this further hope, that his Fortune in the many accidents of Warre might furnish him an opportunity to assault and destroy that Life in the sight of both Armyes, which had bin thitherto preserv'd by his Fathers Teares & dissimulation. And the Fates who have bin asmuch his Freinds in actions of glory, as his Enemyes in those of Love, knoweing what he was destin'd to performe, was too-great to delay any tyme, caus'd Pacuvius (who still apprehended the discovery of his fiction and the sadd events it would inevitably produce) to Command his generous Sonne, to goe unto this Towne, which then had bin freshly yeelded to Hanniball by Pacuvius power, there to countenance his Freinds; which injunction you may well conjecture was as pleaseing to Perolla as his removeall from Capua was to his Father. This journy thus resolv'd Pacuvius furnisht his Sonne with a Traine fitt for one of the blood of Diomedes the Argian who founded the Citty of Agrippa in the Brutians from whome he was Lynealy descended. The next Night after he left Capua he lay in a Towne call'd Pettely, and the morning following was 'waken'd with an Allarme, that the considerablest parte of Hanniballs Army under Himilco's command had surrounded the Towne, which had struck so great a terror in the Pettelins, that they had deputed some of the Inhabitants to treate on conditions for a surrender, The timorousnesse of those People did not so much perplexe him as he was pleas'd at so large an occasion of glory, He could not fancy that the designe of yeelding proceeded from Feare, but for want of a Cheife which might employ their Courages to the best advantage, and though his greene youth had 'till then exempted him from the harras and noyse of Armes, yet his Genius had ever so great a propensity to warre, that he then understood asmuch of the Theory as since he has of the Practicque, and thought too that his Courage & aversion to Hanniball would supply the deffect of his vnexperience. Whilst he was hastily putting onn his Cloaths he entertain'd himselfe with such thoughts, and was hardly ready when he went towards that Gate through which he was told the Deputyes of the Citty were to passe, where he was no sooner come than he perceiv'd them, accompany'd by many of their Freinds, That sight (as he often told me) inspir'd him with so high a fury, that he Commanded all those of his Retinue (which were above Twenty) to draw their Swords, & let none passe through that Port without his expresse orders, then advanceing himselfe towards the Croud which accompany'd their Commissioners, he cry'd out to them, Whither runne you o degenerate Pettelins? can you thinke that Slaves to the Carthaginians is a more glorious tytle than Freinds to the Romans? can you so much despaire of the Gods protection as to act that your selues than which their power cannot inflict a greater misery? is a wretched life so pleasing that to purchase it you will out-live the ruine of your Country, & which is worse, make your feares hasten it? if gallantry and reason will not move you, let the example of Magius's blood doe it, which was shedd a sacrifice to appease Hanniball, and since his rage must be quench't by such oblations, 'tis more nobler to let our veines be empty'd to defend our liberty than to be a Testimony of our haveing lost it, which is a fate wee shall too justly merit if we doe not oppose it. Many other motives he lay'd open to them, with such a charming eloquence & action, that the Pettelins resolv'd to stop their Commissioners, and to owne their sufferings to their misfortunes rather than their Feares. You will pardon me (Sir) said the faire Izadora if I doe but breifly passe over the Affaires of this memorable Seidge (though by it the Towne became more famous for the Governor than the Founder, who was Philoctetes the Sonne of Pean that kept the Arrowes of Hercules, without which the Prophet Calchus declar'd Troy could not be taken) since my sexe dispences me from any knowledge in things of this nature, & because it serves but to acquaint you with that Gallantry of which already you have (with all the World) so just an opinion. I will therefore with your permission only tell you, that after Himilco had receiv'd an absolute denyall of Pettely from Perolla: a thousand affronts by bloody sallyes: and that he had continu'd foure Monthes of a difficult Seidge: he at last plainely sent Hanniball word (then beleaguering of Cassilinum) that vnlesse he and all his Army came to his releife, the Pettelins were like to carry away too-much glory for those which were Enemyes to Carthage. This message made him observe the desire of him that sent it, asmuch for the respect he pay'd so great a Souldier, as out of an opinion it would be no small accession to his Glory if he could take a Citty which Himilco (by his owne confession) esteem'd too difficult an enterprize for him alone. Hanniball therefore left Forces to block up Cassilinum, and came with the rest to Pettely, where haveing view'd the place and the resolute Countenance and Posture of the Defendants (maugre his high Heart) he resolv'd before he came to extreames, to practice milde wayes, which if they tooke would not only free him from those just feares the Gallantry of his Enemyes had created, but augment his reputation by his Presence reduceing That which a great Army and a greater Commander could not effect. In order to this resolve he sent a Trumpet unto Pettely, who after the due ceremonyes of Warre was admitted, & deliver'd Perolla a sumons which cotain'd these words.  destroy the Sonne, but his speedy submission must giue the rise to effect it. You shall have honourable tearmes Perolla, to inuite you from that ruine your resistance will cast upon you, and my mercy shall giue you better conditions than your Sword can, Doe not therefore by your obstinacy force me to reuenge that blood you have already spilt, which I am willing to pardon upon the same score that has made me rather elect to make use of my Penn than of my Victorious Armes.  This Letter by the joynt consent of all the Pettelins had this retourne.  his blood deliuer up a place by Intreaty which the Courages of the Defendants will render inuincible: No generous Hanniball, I sett so high a rate on your esteeme, that I will not deriue it from another but my selfe, and therefore will owe it to my Courage not extraction. Thus much I acquaint you from my selfe, but now I am commanded to tell you from my Companions, that Roman Hearts and Swords are a better security than any Affricans Mercy.  it had more of resolution, But Hanniball (the haughtiest of Men) was so accustom'd to conquer, that he esteem'd a refusall as badd as a defeate, and being inspir'd with a high rage at this denyall, he gave so furious an assault to Pettely, that almost all Courages but that of Perolla's might without shame have yeelded to it, but His in That defence did things so farre transcending beleife, that to raise your Faith to credit them I must lessen their greatnesse, and injure his Vallor lest you might beleive I doe the like to Truth: In a word, never more Lybian blood in this Empire was so vnsuccessefully spent as there, and never Glory was more nobly purchas'd than in that fatall day (to the Carthaginians) who lost besides the hopes of Conquest 2000. of their best men, and twice as many by their wounds were render'd vnserviceable. Whilst these things were acting, the Pettelins had sent two of their cheifest Cittizens to begg the Senats ayde, whome they found (aswell by that they observ'd as by their owne declaration) in a posture fitter to desire than send releife. This proceeding of the Senats as it was a great proofe of their ingenuity, so it was of their necessity, and therefore forced these Deputyes to fling themselves at their Feete, and conjure them with all expressions of a reall greife, to make them messengers of more comfort or else permit them to sacrifice their lives in their sights, as being a more pleasing destiny than to be Testimonyes of the ruine of their Citty, which so fatall an answer would render vnavoydable. This gallantry was so prevalent with the Senate, that after (through a generous sympathy) they had pay'd them back their Teares, they commanded the Deputyes to retourne to their Cittizens and tell them, that what they had done already had bin so much obligeing that nothing could increase the score but to save themselves by a tymely submission to the Conqueror, and thereby preserve those who had shew'd so great a proportion of constancy and Courage that they were more concern'd in their safety's than in their owne. The two Comissioners at last to obey their Masters came home through a world of danger with that retourne, and truely this was a tendernesse of the Romans which they had manifested to none of their Subjects, for in all other cases they chose rather to loose their Freinds than the reputation of their Armes, but in this they preferr'd the former before the latter. But this was so farre from induceing them to yeeld that by Perolla's perswasion they determin'd by a generous resistance or glorious ruine to merit so high a Care, and that which made them the more intent on this, was, the Senats having acquainted them of their duty, which render'd their further actions an obligation to the Roman Empire. But Hanniball who by Three bloody Assaults had learn'd that Famine only could make him Lord of Pettely, had given over all hopes of obtaining it by storme,  & lay a while blocking of it up with asmuch quiet as his disgraces would permit, and at last weary'd with the tediousnesse of the Seidge left Himilco to Starve them out, and brought the best parte of his Army to renew the Seidge of Cassilinium where Manitius a gallant Roman Comanded. Himilco to obey his Generalls orders, had in fewe weekes so straightn'd Pettely, that those in it did more justly feare their ruine from within than without, but by the generous example of Perolla they suffer'd with asmuch patience as they acted with resolution, and to say truth, I know not which was more meritorious, their active or their passive partes. In this generall Calamity there happn'd so rare an accident, that though I exceedingly long to runn through these blooddy relations, yet I cannot passe by this memorable adventure without being as vnjust as the performers of it were gallant. The Famine in Pettely was so increas'd, that the place was inevitably to fall into the Enemyes hands were not the want of Victualls immediatly redress'd, & though (in the begining of the Seidge) they had sent away all their old People and Children, yet they had reteyn'd so many women, that the feeding of them must of necessity hasten their ruine. This inconvenience was never mention'd by Perolla who bare too-high a respect to our Sexe to preserve those of his owne by exposeing ours to the least hazard or suffering. But a certaine Lady (whose vertue, beauty, extraction and wealth, render'd her the most considerable amongst the Pettelins) plainely perceiv'd how great an inconveniency Perolla's Civility was like to produce. Amazora therefore (for so shee was call'd) having gotten a high and just value in that Citty, resolv'd to employ it to some ende which might make her as famous to posterity as her perfections merited. To effect this shee assembl'd the cheifest Women of Pettely. To those which shee thought glory was more pleasing to than life, shee acquainted with her resolution of stealing out of the Towne and exposeing her selfe to the Swords of Hanniballs Souldiers, and thereby free the Citty from the misery of Famine, or at least from their hastening it. To others which shee beleiv'd preferr'd their safty above all other considerations, shee represented the certaine languishing death they must vnavoydably suffer by their residence in Pettely, and the probability of avoyding that Fate by submiting to the Carthaginians, who could not be so mercilesse to a Sexe which the vnreasonable Creatures even by the lawe of Nature reverence and preserve. In a word, shee so fitted her perswasions to the severall humors of those shee courted, and at last so fully vanquish'd their feares and confirm'd their resolutions, that two Nights after (having corrupted a Centinell which was a meniall Servant of hirs, for there being noe Garrison the Inhabitants did the duty) and by his helpe (her house standing upon the Walls of the Towne) about 2000. Women (with Ropes and Baskets) got out of Pettely. The next morning before Day a Servant of Amazora's brought this Letter to Perolla, who having open'd it, found it contain'd words to this purpose.  valiant Companions. dayly demonstrations of your Gallantryes created some in us, and though the too rigid Lawes of our Sexe forbids us to employ our Resolutions in an actiue, yet it exempts us not from a passiue vertue. VVee are therefore gone to expose our selues to the Carthaginians Swords, and had rather they should be employ'd for our destructions than be indebted for our Liues to those which are Enemyes to your and our Liberties. If contrary to our hopes and desires they saue us, we haue eas'd you of a burthen your Ciuilities did not mention, and which consequently bad had an vnfitting retourne any way but this, But if we are sacrific'd to their fury, let your Courages (if they are capable of any accession) be thereby so heightn'd, that whilst you celebrate our deaths in Teares you necessitate your Enemyes to doe the like in Blood.  and it is as difficult to describe the sorrow which suddenly ensu'd as the cruelty which was the cause of it, for assoone as the Sunn had render'd visible all objects within the reach of sight, Perolla and his Companions perceiv'd the Feilds strew'd with the dead Boddyes of those Gallant Women which the barbarous Affricans had cruelly murther'd Iudge (generous Spartacus) what a just fury this vnequald impiety inspir'd Perolla & the Pettelius with, But their actions will better acquaint you with their resentments than my expressions can, For in that Sally (where they now were lead on by revenge aswell as honor, they kill'd above 1500. Lybians, and the Execution had bin farre blouddyer had not they spent the best parte of their tyme in fetching off the bodyes of Amazora & those of best quality, whose Manes had no cause to wander if the destruction of their murtherers could hinder it. Never Victory had lesse joy in it than this, and never funerall was solemniz'd with more Teares than that of those admirable Women: & indeede the beseidged's greifes appear'd so just, that their Reason rather continu'd than supprest them. But it is high tyme to leade you out of so forlorne an entertainment, which I will doe by acquainting you, that though Perolla now perswades me I possesse his heart entirely, yet he cannot deny, but that I have only the reversion of it, neither would I passe by (though the Truth of my story oblig'd me not to it) the virtues of my Ryvall, which indeede merit a perticular Elogium, and were I capable of describeing them as they deserve, I know none that would have declin'd her Fate to have had her Glory. Her Fire was of so peculiar a quallity that when it had reduc'd her to Ashes, those very relliques retain'd heate enough to inflame him, & perhaps there has bin seldome heard of a Love so strange in the birth, in the life, and in the death, For it was created by an object that was dead, the effect remained when the cause was taken away, and having no materiall sustenance to preserve it selfe alive, it liv'd upon speculation, and to perfect the wonder 'twas Izadora destroy'd it. But I tell you too much of the end before I acquaint you with the begining which tell out thus. Perolla returning from that famous buriall, One of those Men which had bin order'd to take an Inventory of Amazora's goods and preserve them, presented him with a Letter he had found in her Closset, and because the superscription was, he opend it, & found it contain'd these words.  shee liu'd, th'impossibility of disclosing it had bin as great as perhaps the obtaining of a reciprocall one: Doe not then condemne a confidence I wash away with my Blood, nor slight an Affection which is as perfect as the object that created it, neither am I only a Freind to your Passion but your Glory, which I am resolu'd to raise upon my owne Ruine and the Ruine of all those of my Sexe within this Citty: our Death's shall delay (if not hinder) yours, and giue you tyme enough to act such additionall generous things, that those which are acquainted with them and with my Flame shall excuse the latter by the knowledge of the former. If all this can procure your esteeme I shall thinke my destiny too noble to be deplor'd, and if for the Life I loose I may Liue in your Memory, I shall esteeme it a more happy being than that which the Gods have promis'd in the other world to those which have bin vertuous in this.  will preserve you still in my memory, and were it not to obey your Commands the World should know that your death is so farre from delaying mine, that it has but hasten'd it. Then folding his Armes one within the other, he stood movelesse as a Statue for a while, raining from his Eyes whole showers of Teares, but after a world of confus'd thoughts had past through his Fancy, he cry'd out againe, Would it had plea'd the Gods (faire Amazora) to have made you but as concern'd in my happinesse as in my Glory: Cruell Honor! was there no expedient to build thy Trophies but by the ruine of my Felicity? must the way to reach my Glory, ruine my contentment?  oh too-hard Fates: why did I not knowe my happinesse whilst I possest it? and why am I acquainted with it when 'tis vanish't? was I to be blest only to be curst? must the knowledge of more joy than I could expect, create more greife than I can endure? and must Amazora's Passion for Me be so order'd that the revealing of it must prove my torment? Whilst Izadora was relateing this sadd reasoning, her generous Servant was so struck with Sorrow, that shee who sympathiz'd with him in all virtuous resentments, was constrain'd to breake off her discourse, which the Company perceiving, they did manifest by a generall silence from all things but sighes, how just an opinion they had of their Greife, and how highly they approv'd the cause of it. A litle tyme being so spent, and Izadora having wip't away her Teares thus continu'd her Story. I will not tell you all the melancholly expressions Perolla us'd, lest it might infect you with a Greife I would willingly exempt you from, I shall therefore only informe you that he contracted a Passion for her Memory as great as any other could have had for her Beauty, and that (whilst the Seidge continu'd) twice a day he constantly water'd her Vrne with such abundant weepeings, that had those Teares bin inwardly employ'd they had doubtlesse extinguisht his Greife, his Flame, or his Life. At last (gallant Spartacus) the Famine so increast in Pertely, that 'twas impossible any longer to maintaine the Place, and though Himilco offer'd him (and all those with him) conditions fitt for Souldiers, yet he scorn'd to stand indebted for his Life to those which had taken away Amazora's, but rather elected to force his passage with his Sworde, or perish in the attempt: neither was this only his designe, but that which he infus'd into all the rest. That day being then come, the Towne was on all quarters set on Fier, that the Carthaginians might neither use nor glory in their Conquest, and Perolla at the head of 3000. Pettelins (which were all that were left) Furiously charged the Affricans, and by dint of Sword forced his passage, and to animate his Souldiers he cry'd out (nothing but) remember Amazora and her Followers. And truely I am perswaded, all the eloquence the Gods ever bestow'd on Man, could not have bin more powerfull than were those fewe words. 'Twas in that great Action Perolla did miracles, and I have bin told, the slaughter was so bloudy, that all those gallant unfortunate Women had each of them one of their dead Murtherers for a cover of their Graves, the Fight happening in those very Feilds where so horrid a Massacre had bin committed, On Perolla's side there fell 800. which number I beleive he might have lessen'd, had he stolne and not made his retreate, But Night comeing, ended their dispute, and my gallant Freind haveing rally'd the reliques of his Forces, propounded and perswaded them to force their passage in to Cassilinum, which was not above 200. furlongs off, and which was beseidged then by Hanniball. This resolve being taken, the next Night by vnfrequented wayes they began their march, and the day following towards the Euening beate up a Quarter of the Carthaginians and by the death of 700. Lybians made a Triumphant entry into the Towne, presenting Manitius (the Governor and Freind to Perolla) both with a Releife and a victory, which so rais'd his dejected Souldiers, that they brake off the Treaty of surrender they had almost concluded. 'Twas in this memorable Seidge that Perolla did such glorious things that (as litle as I am concern'd in a Affaires of that nature) they reacht my Eares, and I must with guilty blushes acknowledge, that the hatred I had to his blood made me looke upon those actions with Enuy which I should have consider'd with admiration. But after sixe Months Seidge, the same Fate which attended Him at Pettely follow'd him at Cassilinum, and though the Famine was extreme pressing, yet the Romans notwithstanding they were under the Command of Marcellus (called for his Courage the Sworde of the Roman Empire by the Dictators goeing to Rome to take new Auspices) yet he durst not hazard a Battell for their preservation. The Inhabitants and Souldiers of the Garrison (for all Perolla's scorn'd it) findeing their sadd condition privatly offer'd to surrender upon Quarter, which would not so much as be listen'd unto by Hanniball, for their abrupt breaking of their first Treaty when the Reliques of Perolla's Forces releiv'd them. At last though they receiv'd some provisions which Marcellus in Barrells sent them floating downe the River Vulturnus, yet that stratagem being too soone discover'd, they were constrain'd to feede upon Mice, Ratts, and such Rootes as they could digg out of their Counterscarfe and Meddowes under their Walls, which being perceiv'd by the Carthaginian, he caus'd all those feilds to be plow'd up, But that was no sooner done than Perolla & his Pettelins by a sally sowe'd seed in their Enemyes labour, Hanniball being told it, only spoake these few Words, Must then that which I designe to starve the Romans with, prove their harvest? and immediatly sent Manitius and Perolla blankes to write their Conditions in, which they (being as invincible in Civility as Courage) retourn'd, & immediatly came out without makeing any: His usage indeede was generous, but he would not see Perolla least (as he said) his passion might force him to that violence which his reason detested. Hanniball thus became Master of Cassilinum, yet at his entry into it he solemnly vowed he was more troubl'd to have Perolla for his Enemy than pleas'd with his Victory, As for the Garrison they martch'd directly to the Dictators Army, where Pacuvius Sonne was receiv'd both by him (who was then retourn'd) and by Marcellus, with an entertainment which relisht nothing of the hatred they pay'd his Father. The Senate too, to gratify him, order'd that all his Souldiers during their Lives should have double pay, and though they needed such Courages, yet they gave them five yeares vacation, and for his owne perticuler, they orderd his Statue to be erected in Preneste, which was the next considerable Towne: but he with a modesty greate as his merit refus'd it himselfe, and had that honor plac'd upon Manitius, thereby by declineing the reward, increaseing his Title to it. Perolla haveing by such memorable exployts runn through his prentiship in Armes, was very desirous to waite upon his Father, who he was confident had bury'd his disobedience in those generous actions which had proceeded from it. Pacuvius then liv'd in this Citty, (which was under the Command of Hanniball) and because his Sonnes Actions had bin as fatall to the Carthaginians as advantagious to the Romans, he resolv'd to performe that visit & duty with asmuch secrecy as was possible, therefore he came late alone into the Towne, lest a retinue might give some suspition of his quality & discover what he endeavour'd to conceale, but as he crost a Streete that was not farre from Blacius's house, he perceiv'd (by the light of a couple of Torches which lay upon the ground by the death of two that had carried them) a Gentleman, who with much Courage oppos'd himselfe against foure that assaulted him, The inequality of the number & the Courage of the Defendant made Perolla (who never vallu'd his life in the protectio of the opressed) resolve to helpe him that so highly needed it, and truely had he never so litle longer delay'd his assistance, he had bin only obligeing in designe, for by that tyme he was lighted from his Horse, & had drawne out his Sword, one of the foure Assaylants had gotten the single Gentleman under him, and was seekeing out the defects of his Coate of Maile, to have taken away his Life, But Perolla by a powerfull stroake, cleft the wretches head in two, and whilst his Companions were amaz'd at so vnexpected a Releife and so fatall a blowe Perola gave my Father (for it was he indeed) leave to gett up, and then presenting him with the Sword which he had lost by his fall told him, Heere (Sir) the Gods will defend your Quarrell, which I judge is good, because your Enemyes rely only on their Numbers for their successe, Blacius had no tyme to make him any retourne of this Civility, for the three Murtherers, having resign'd their admiration to take up their first resolution, fell so vigorously upon my Father and his generous Second, that had they not bin vnder the protection of Divinity, they had certainly miscaryed: But Perolla, who had to deale with two of the Three receiv'd some wounds, which yet were so farre from endangering his Life that they did but hasten the losse of theirs which had bestow'd them on him, for with a furious thrust he dispatched the most importunate of them, and (in a word) after he had once againe saved & releiv'd Blacius, they made an end of the other two. As soone as my Father found himselfe free'd from his Enemyes, he came to Perolla & told him Sir, that I am indebted to you for my Life is not a greater Truth, than that I shall never make any scruple to loose it in your service, but lest my ignorance might (when occasion serves) render me vncapable of paying you that debt, I shall begg to be acquainted with your Name, that by my future gratitude you may be convinc't the obligations you have lay'd upon one that was unknowne to you, were not for all missplac'd. Perolla, though he knew not my Father, yet not dareing to discover himselfe, reply'd. The service I have payde you is so much the duty of one Gentleman to another, that it merits not an acknowledgment, & to assure you this is not a Complement but a truth, I am resolv'd to conceale my Name lest by acquainting you with it, you might immagin I expected some further returne: Then desiring to know if he had any other Commands to impose on him he began to take his leave, but Blacius who admir'd his Civillity asmuch as Courage, could not satisfy himselfe with such an answer, and therefore told him; I must rather beleive that some secret busines drawes you hither, and that not knowing who I am, you apprehend my privacy: if this be the true cause I beseech you remove it, for you could not thinke me worthy your defence, if after having sav'd my life you doubted I could disclose any thing which might be prejudiciall to my Protector. Perolla was about to reply when (alas) on a sudden the fresh colour in his Cheeks began to weare Deaths livery, his Knees too to tremble and at last his Spirits failing he fell (without speech or motion) at my Fathers Feete; this sudden change made him suspect some private hurts were the cause of it, he therefore open'd his Doublet, and immediatly discover'd a Sea of Blood which issu'd from a large wound that had peirc't his body through & through. My Father instantly with what linnen he could teare, stop't the bleeding asmuch as he could, but having in vaine attempted to bring him from the swound he was fallen into, was running to his owne house, which (as I told you) was not farre off, to call for helpe, but he was not many Paces in the way to this duty and Charity when he heard one of the foure Murtherers fetch a deepe groane: The passionat desire he had to learne from whome he had so narrowly 'scap't, made him pluck off the vizard of him that was yet alive (for I forgot to tell you they were all disguis'd in antick Cloathes and Faces) who no sooner receiv'd the benefit of the fresh aire than he open'd his Eyes, and gave some small symptomes of Life, which though they were false ones, yet he liv'd long enough to begg my Fathers pardon, & to acquaint him that Pacuvius had enguadg'd them by excessive Rewards to undertake their Crime. Blacius haveing receiv'd this information went instantly to his owne house, brought some Servants with him, and by their helpe carryed the generous Perolla home, whose wounds he caus'd the Chirurgions to dresse before he would take any care of a slight one he had receiv'd. In the meane tyme th' Allarme of my Fathers danger and returne was brought to my Chamber as I was vndressing my selfe, which I no sooner heard than I came running up, just as the Charthaginians had by strong Cordialls brought Perolla to himselfe, My Father when I came in, lead me to his Bedside and told me, if my life be any way considerable to you, you are indebted to this Gentleman for it, who by the hazard of his owne has preseru'd Mine. Sir (I reply'd) I hope you have so just an opinion of my duty & Affection as to thinke that question needs no answer, but as for this Gentlemans gallantry I beleive he will have no cause to repent it, if at lest by the hazarding only of one life he thinkes himselfe sufficiently recompenc'd by acquiring those of a whole Family. I shall renounce any of mine (said Blacius) that ever decline what you have spoaken, and for your perticuler (addressing himselfe to me) I command you to be as concern'd in him as if I were in his Condition, for I shall judge of your respect to mee by your care of my Freind. Then embraceing Perolla he told him, Some importunat affaires Sir drawes me from you for a while for which I must begg your Pardon, but 'till my returne I have enjoyn'd my Daughter to supply my place. Madam (said Perolla interrupting the faire Izadora) I shall with your permission acquaint the generous Spartacus what happen'd whilst I continu'd in your Fathers house, which will not only ease you of some parte of your Relation, but informe him of perticulers which perhaps your modesty might injure you by silenceing. Spartacus having made her the same request and obtain'd her leave, Perolla thus continu'd. You may (Sir) justly wonder that to those high Civilities of the perfect Izadora & her Father shee acquainted you with none of my returnes, and truly if shee had shee must have made them hirselfe, for I was so ravisht with her Beauty, that all I then was capable of was of admireing it: for though shee was not then in that advantagious dresse which Rome so much commends, yet the habit shee then had onn was order'd with such a pleasing negligence that noe arte was able to equall it, & if her Beauty had bin of a nature which could admitt of addition by Cloaths, those shee then woare (me thought) would have increast hirs, I must ingenuously cofesse that comeing from death into so much Brightnesse I fancy'd my selfe in those Playnes where our learned Men makes us beleive wee shall dwell after this Life, and I dare boldly affirme, if wee beleiv'd so much reall felicity there as I then resented, that place would be better inhabited than it is. I shall beseech you said Izadora (interrupting him and speaking to Spartacus) to remember the acknowledgment he makes of his judgement being troubl'd, that what vnmerited raptures he delivers of me, you may attribute them to their true cause, & not to that unto which he ascribes them. Then addressing hirselfe to Perolla (with a litle smile) shee told him, If the use you make of my permission to tell parte of our Adventures be only thus to abuse your Freind: I shall immediatly recall it, & rather elect to injure our Story by my relation than suffer those Blushes which your partiality will still create. Madam (said Spartacus) you are so farre above flattery, that whilst your generous Lover prayses you all he can, you neede apprehend nothing but that he will come short of Truth. To which Perolla answer'd, (with a looke, that spoke his doubts whither what Spartacus had said proceeded from his justice or a more dangerous Cause) You have (Sir) in this as fully declar'd my opinion, as if we had but one heart, and that too inspir'd with the same Beauty, which is so accomplisht, that if Izadora will forgive me all faults which detracts too-much from her, I shall not neede her Pardon for those of a contrary nature. Spartacus by a litle readnesse testified the construction he made of Perolla's first words, but the apprehension of being deceiv'd in his opinion, and the resolution he had taken up of soone suppressing all suspitions of that quality made him continue silent, which invited Izadora's servant to prosecute what he had begun. Since (said he) my want of expressions for so transcendent an object, and her commands doe both binde me from giveing you a caracter of that by words which your Eyes are better able to performe, I will only acquaint you, That though I remain'd a while without speaking yet it proceeded not from any new fitts of fainting, but from having all my facultyes employ'd to receive those Flames shee then shott into me, and truely I found the Fire so pleasing and so just, that I made not any excuse for introduceing it in the roome of that heate I had 'till then preserv'd for the faire Amazora, the difference betwixt them being so greate, that could I have suspended my election I should have concluded my judgement as dead as the first object of my Passion. To be breife, never Lover made more haste to fruition than I to divest my selfe of Liberty, and never Slave receiv'd his freedome with more joy than I resign'd up mine. But whilst I was in these first extacyes, Izadora who missinterpreted my silence, ask'd me whether I had a minde to take any rest, for if I had shee would withdrawe herselfe. Madam (I reply'd) if you have a designe I shall take any I must derive it from your presence and not from your absence, since the latter wilbe so farre from giveing me any ease that it will divest me of all. Truely Sir (shee answer'd) the condition you are in (me thinks) may well dispence with civilities, and your wounds are too dangerous to neglect (out of a Complement) any thing which may conduce to their recovery. If you meane (I reply'd) those wounds I receiv'd in the Streete, they are too-inconsiderable to purchase their ease by your absence: but if you intend those which are given me since I came into this Chamber, I must then confesse I would decline nothing which might any way lessen their paine or advance their recovery; but I finde by experiment, that their nature is to be lest troublesome when the faire Enemy that made them is visible. I had not ended speaking when I perceiv'd all Izadora's Face cover'd with Blushes, & hir Eyes arm'd with so majestick a Fire, that I almost repented the disclosing of what I could not possibly have longer silenc'd, but to disguise her disorder shee told me, I hope you have receiv'd no wounds since you came into this place, if you have, I dare assure you they were given without designe. Alas Madam (I reply'd) I am then the more vnfortunate, & that which you apply for a lessening is an increase of my trouble, for my condition is so singuler, that whereas in other cases to hurt without designe is hardly an offence, in mine the contrary is the greatest that can befall me. But yet I may finde some satisfaction, since custome enjoynes wheresoever any wounds are receiv'd without an intention of giveing them, that the Person which gave them as a marke of innocency should endeavour their cure if it lyes in the Givers power, permit me then to begg this customary tryall of the truth of your wordes, which is not called in question by me but by my happinesse. I esteeme (answer'd Izadora) the Rule you speake of so just, that were it I which have hurt you, and that you shew me the wound and prove your recovery in my power, I would oblige my selfe to be your Phisition. Alas Madam (I answer'd) the wound is in my heart, and therefore not to be seene but with the Eyes of Faith, But if my assurance will not convince you of it's reallity, the knowledge you have of your owne Beautyes will doubtlesse effect it. I am gald (reply'd Izadora) that your hurt being in a mortall place you are yet so well, which gives me some hope that the paine of your last wound is rather in immagination than reallity: But if it be internall as you alleadge, I dare not vndertake to be your Chyrurgion, for to discover the place where you say your wound is, I must make a greater than I am cofident I shall finde there. Though indeede replyes of this nature were not very pleasing in themselves, yet it was no small satisfaction to me, for from them I flatteringly inferr'd, if shee had a designe of declining my Flame I had spoaken enough to acquaint her with it, & consequently given her a rise to have mention'd her aversion for it, but her imposeing on my words a meaning which indeed they could not well beare, & the troubling hirselfe for their misconstruction afforded me some hope that they were not absolutely vnpardonable. Gods! what extacyes of joy did possesse me whilst I had that beleife? & how I blest my wounds that were the happy cause of so pleasing (though immaginary) a felicity? But (alas) this was only a capritiousnesse of Fortune, who gave me a taste of happinesse that the subsequent Feares might be the more intollerable. For the faire Izadora had forgot to aske of Blacius my Name which shee acquainted me with, and which I look'd upon as her desire of knowing it, This made me tell her, Madam, had you had that curiosity whilst your Father was here, he could not have satisfyed it: some important causes ty'd me to a concealment of it, neither can your knowing it be any way advantagious to your service, could I immagin it were, did the discovery bring more dangers on me than Cowards fancy, I would embrace them all with raptures of joy, Yet perhaps my Life & Sword may be more fortunate than my Name by proveing capable of serving you, if they be I shall esteeme both of them too-gloriously employ'd: And truly (Madam) the litle desire I had to be knowne, or continue long in this Towne made me not inquisitive of your Fathers, but since I finde my felicity or misery depends upon one that is of his Family, I shall humbly begg to be acquainted with it, and esteeme it a high obligation if at lest my curiosity may not prove prejudiciall to him. Since (reply'd Izadora) you assure me, that my informing you of it will oblige you, I am confident the concealment cannot be of more consequence than the disclosure, and it is but reasonable that you should know who is your Debtor, his name is Blacius. How Madam (I hastily reply'd) Blacius? the mortall Enemy of Pacuvius? Yes (said Izadora) that Blacius is my Father, and he who you so lately oblig'd: and my name Izadora. Ah Madam (I cry'd out fetching a deepe sigh) what is it that you have told me? The faire Izadora & I were so perplext, shee at my exclaiming and I at her information, that for a long while wee both continu'd in silence, which at last shee interrupted by desireing to know from whence my disorder proceeded. Alas Madam (I reply'd) The great Freindship I have contracted with Perolla (Pacuvius's Sonne) is the cause of my trouble, how can I but deplore his misfortune in haveing you for his Enemy? where your continuing so will (I feare) prove as great an injury to his felicity as I apprehend the contrary wilbe to your extraction. If (said Izadora) you are so intimatly acquainted with Perolla I beseech you informe me whether all those Praises that are given him proceed from justice or partiality. Truly Madam (I reply'd) the knowing of him perfectly makes me vnfit to resolve your question, for wee were so much one, & had both so much the same Soule, that I plac't the selfesame judgement on his Actions which he himselfe did, & therefore you might aswell hope to be satisfyed of Perolla from Perolla, as by enquireing any thing of him from me; but this I dare affirme, that had he once the happinesse I now have, he would have too the same inclinations, and if my Passion possest him after seeing so much Beauty, it would be of a contrary nature to what has bin hitherto common to his Family. You must excuse me (said Izadora) if I beleive he would prefer his duty before any other consideration, but I would not a litle rejoyce at the contrary, for since his hatred to our Family is his Crime I would have his Love to one of it prove his punishment. Ah Madam (I reply'd) are you then determin'd to be cruell? must Perolla have so hard a Fate that because his birth was vnhappy his Life must be so too? shall his misfortune in being Pacuvius's Sonne be esteem'd his fault? and shall a sinn he derives from his Father be more prevalent to create your hatred than the service he has pay'd Blacius be to produce a contrary effect? My Passion in this discourse transported me so farre, that Izadora interrupted me by saying, The words which you now speake (Sir) would induce me to beleive that you are Perolla rather than his Freind. Yes Madam (I reply'd, casting downe my Eyes and trembling all over) I doe confesse I am Perolla, and though at first I design'd not to acquaint you who I was 'till my actions had in some degree quallify'd your aversion to my blood, yet I finde you have so transcendent an influence over me, that I could noe more conceale my Name than my Passion, This overture gives you power equall to your desire of being reveng'd on our vnfortunate Family, But remember (faire Izadora) that 'tis cruelty and not justice to ruine one who is so farre from resisting that he yeelds to your mercy. Whilst I was making this declaration, I could plainly reade the trouble of her Minde in her lookes, some tymes me thought they were inclin'd to mercy, & then instantly they appear'd the contrary, at last my suspence vanisht by Izadora's saying, I could gladly wish I had continu'd still in ignorance of your condition, since my knowledge of it reduces me either to betray Blacius or Perolla by discovering or concealing him. Madam (I reply'd) the keeping of my Name secret is not of much importance, for if you now receive my Flame I shall embrace all dangers, and care not who knowes me when I beare the glorious title of Izadora's Servant: and if you reject it, 'twilbe an obligation to let your Father know who I am, since I may hope from his resentments and hatred that cure my deplorable condition will so abundantly want. Izadora (as shee has since assur'd me) was so offended that I had the confidence in so short a tyme to desire an acceptation of my affection, that shee answer'd me briskly, Pacuvius Sonne who is an Enemy to our Family must not here expect to be cur'd of any other wounds than those he receiv'd in defending the Cheife of it, and though your presumption merits my highest revenge, yet the consideration of what you have done for Blacius will make me preserve your Life by not disclosing who you are. Shee had no sooner done speaking but shee rise up and was goeing out of my Chamber when I cry'd out to her, Stay faire Izadora, and see my Life depends not on your silence but on your approveing my Passion, which though you have so cruelly rejected, yet you shall finde I have so much a higher concernment for all your interests than my owne, that I will wash away in my blood my presumption and vnfortunate extraction, and since you have declar'd Perolla to be your Enemy you shall perceive I will use him at that rate. Izadora at these passionate expressions turn'd about againe, but when shee sawe me pulling off my Playsters and teareing my wounds, shee rann to my Bedside, and falling on her knees with a throng of Sighes & Teares shee begg'd me not to be my owne executioner, & if any words shee had spoake were the vnfortunat cause of so fatall an effect shee would recall them. What neede I tell you more (generous Spartacus) than that my despaire was the way to my felicity, and that my designe of killing my selfe preserv'd my Life by obtaining the faire Izadora's permission of making my addresses to her. But to lessen this excesse of joy, I suspected for a while that my apprehension of being vnfortunate had like to have made me really so, and the way I had chosen to end my misery had almost created it, For in my despaire I had so increast the danger of my wounds by useing them as I thought my codition then requir'd that though the Chyrurgions came hastiy to binde them up, yet they could not vndertake for my life, 'till they sawe what operation that dressing would have, and to free me from all noyse that I might take a litle sleepe, Izadora was desir'd to withdrawe, which before shee did, shee came to my Bedside and tould me softly, I hope what I have already done ha's divested you of all thoughts of violence on your Life, if it ha's not, remember that you cannot make any attempts against it, but I shall consider them as offer'd at mine. Madam (I reply'd kissing her hand with transports) what you have done, and what you have spoaken, shall make me cherish asmuch as even now I did detest it, and since 'tis so glorious to merit your care, you cannot suspect it shalbe deny'd mine. Shee was not long gone out of my Chamber, when Blacius came home, and comeing to see me he was inform'd my condition was such, that his visit would rather prove a trouble than a civility, which made him deferre his designe, but he went directly to Izadora's Chamber to learne the cause of my disorder, for he was told shee had not stirr'd ont of Mine since his goeing abroade, and that no other had bin witnesse of my actions. His faire daughter was somewhat perplext at the question, but shee assur'd him, to the best of her observation, it proceeded from a sudden distemper, wherein shee told him the truth and yet conceal'd it from him. The next morning the Chyrurgions found the wounds of my Body (which held a strict Sympathy with those of my minde) so hopefull, that Blacius who was present when they were drest, exprest an infinite satisfaction, and indeede entertain'd me with such trascendent care and civility, that had I ow'd my usage to his knowledge & not to his ignorance of me, I had bin in a felicity worthy of Enuy. But his affaires calling him away, his place was supply'd by Izadora, who acquainted me, that those Murtherers I had kill'd, had bin for certayne hyr'd by Pacuvius to make away Blacius, and that one of them (as he lay weltring in his blood) confest it to him, which was the cause of his goeing out that Night so late, that the examinations might have bin taken by one of the Magistrates, but at their comeing, the party was found dead. Ah Madam (I reply'd) how I apprehnd my Fathers attempt will be as cruell to his owne Sonne, as the performance could have prov'd to his Enemye, and that what he intended for the destruction of Blacius will cause Perolla's, for it is but just, that the daughter should right hir Father on the Sonne of his mortallest Enemy, especially since shee has the Power, and that Pacuvius's affection for me (as he has often declar'd) is greater than that he has for himselfe, and consequently to afflict Perolla is the most sensible way of being reveng'd on his Father; neither can I expect a better fate, vnlesse Izadora's goodnesse be as greate as my Passion. I shall alwayes (shee said) know how to distinguish betwixt the guilty and the Innocent, and therefore will not involve the Sonne in the Fathers Crime, especialy since the gallantry of the former hinder'd the acted sinn of the latter. Oh Madam (I answer'd) how greate were my felicity would Blacius practice the same goodnesse. You neede not doubt it (shee reply'd) in this last action, where your blood testifies your innocence, but for his antient Hatred I feare his resentments. Alas (I cry'd out) I never have those thoughts but I tremble, and would it might please the Gods as the blood I have spent already has purchast me his esteeme, so that the remainder were shedd to continue it after his knowledge of my condition, For I should thinke my death glorious, could it wipe away the infelisity of my Birth, & count it a greater happinesse to dye with the title of your Families Freind than to live in the contrary misfortune. The faire Izadora perceiveing how I afflicted my selfe with those sadd impressions told me. What I have already done may in some sorte represse your feares, neither is despaire pardonable but where impossibilityes turne it into reason; a generous Courage as Perolla's should not antedate his troubles, for somtymes our apprehensions makes us miserable when our Fates designe the contrary. Those (I reply'd) which did flatter me would often publish I had a courage above misfortunes, and I may justly say, in all those dangers I have yet vndergone, I never resented any thing of feare, but what disasters my hard Starres impos'd on me, I found my consolation and security in my resolution, yet in my present condition, whether my feares proceede form some pre-sience of my Ruine, or from a diffidence of so great a felicity I knowe not, but this I am certaine of, that I finde something within which never vntill now I entertain'd. I confesse (said the faire Izadora) when I thinke upon Blacius hatred to your Family, I have some litle tremblings which I can hardly suppresse, but when I consider the services you have pay'd him, and those eminent Quallities you possesse, I finde no other way for the questioning your Content, than by doeing the like aswell to my Fathers judgment as Gratitude. Madam (I reply'd) I have nothing in me, nor have done nothing for him which might so much raise my ambition, But since you doe not only command me to silence my feares, but alleadge I have no cause to continue them I will obey you, since 'tis as impossible for me to erre whilst I doe so, as not to Erre whilst I doe not soe 'Twas with such pleasing discourses as these that I past some dayes, & 'twas well for the tormente of my wounds for no other charme had bin of sufficient force to moderate their paine. At last, Fortune began to cloude this litle Sun-shine, For Izadora vnderstood from a freind of hirs, that agreat disorder was in Pacuvius's house by the arrivall of a Servant of Mine (whome I would not permit to come into Salapia with me but had order'd him to follow, lest I might be the likelyer discover'd). This Servant assur'd my Father that I was come before him alone into the Towne, & that crosseing a streete upon the breake of day, he had found my horse, & obseru'd much blood had bin there spilt, but as for his Master he could learne no newes of him. This Lady was one which had free accesse into both our Families, & having then receiv'd some high disgust in Pacuvius's, told this secrett to the faire Izadora, in expectation that it might come to Blacius knowledge, whose revenge shee easily fancy'd would induce him to make it publique, which would at lest have ruin'd me if not my Father for entertaining and concealing me, But shee knew not that shee told this News to one that was better acquainted with all the perticulers of it than hirselfe, & who was not a litle concern'd in this vnfortunate Life. But Izadora (after her departure) came and not only acquainted me with this inteligence, but advis'd me to make my selfe knowne to Blacius, for since the businesse had already so much vent, if he came to learne it any other way, it might be look't upon at a rate that would extreamely aggravate his former hatred. I must truly confesse, had this advice proceeded from any other, I should have found a strong oppose all in my obedience but shee had such an ascendent over me, that in all her commands how difficult soever they were in themselves, I did not only finde reason but power to obey them; and in this injunction of hirs, I had no sooner taken up my resolution, than I was furnisht with an opertunity to put it in practice; For Blacius who was alwayes present at the dressing of my wounds, was so sensible of the Torment I endur'd, that he could not retaine some dropps from stealeing out of his Eyes, and as soone as the Chyrurgions were gone he embrac'd me and said. If the Gods (generous stranger) would graunt a power of trasferring paine upon him that is most desirous of it, you should quickly then resent none but what your goodnesse for my sufferings would produce, Were that priviledge (I answer'd) bestow'd upon men, my condition would not be at all improv'd, for that rule would continue the sufferings where they are already, neither could they be remov'd as you desire, without doubling my trouble, by afflicting me in that which I am more concearn'd in than in my selfe. You are (reply'd Blacius) so obligeing both in action & expression, that there is noe way of increasing my debt but by acquainting me how I may pay some parte of it. When you speake (I reply'd) of being indebted to me, you doe certainly meane to my desires, & not my actions, but because you are pleas'd to stile the effects of my duty, obligations, I will not oppose that beleife, since to have rais'd it is not only my ambition, but is besides exceeding necessary towards the obtaineing of a request I have to make to you; a Request of so strange a property, that the denyall of it once, will make me uncapable of ever asking it againe, & the graunting it, will never let me stand in neede of askeing any other. If (said Blacius with some impatiency) the graunting this desire be in my power, why doe you not name it? since to conferre on you a concession of this quality & operation wilbe a greater favour to the giver than it can be to the receiver. 'Tis Sir (I reply'd) that you would pardon my vnhappy Extraction, & not esteeme that my fault which is my misfortune. An Extraction (Blacius answer'd) which has produced so much Gallantry cannot be lowe or inconsiderable, or if it be so in it selfe, your vertue will change it into the contrary, But (he coutinu'd) I canot fancy why the granting of what you aske can worke so powerfull an effect as even now you mention'd. Alas Sir (I reply'd) you mistake my meaning, for I am borne in a Family that is cosiderable enough both for Antiquity, Honor & Wealth, & indeed has no other defect or vnhappinesse but what is caus'd by Your aversion to it: I feare after this declaratio you can no longer doubt but 'tis Pacuvius's I intend, whose vnfortunate Sonne I am. Is this (said Blacius starting) to trye how farre my gratitude can extend, or else is it a reall Truth? 'Tis the latter (I answer'd) and though I apprehend by what I observe that this discovery will prove my ruine, yet I had rather derive it from my extraction which is a cryme I could not avoyde, than by deluding you, which is a voluntary sinn, and consequently might justly authorize your hatred. Blacius having cast upon me a hundred furious lookes at last told me. You are then Pacuvius Sonne: oh vnjust Fates! must I owe my life to a cause which makes me detest it? and must my misery be so great that to have dye'd by the hands of Murtherers, hir'd by my Enemy too, had bin a happinesse? Is life left me only to know that not to have bin kill'd was a misfortune? Then folding his Armes one within the other be fetch'd (with great stepps) foure or five turnes about the Chamber, & on a sudden striking one of his hands upon his Brest he continu'd, No no, I am not so wretched as my Passion would perswade me, for Pacuvius designe was not only defeated, but was defeated by his Sonne: and Perolla by receiveing wounds in this Quarrell wounds his Father, who cannot consider the meanes why his ends have fail'd but the knowledge of the former will increase the misery of the latter, neither can I justly complaine, when my mortal'st Enemy insteed of a pleasing revenge embraces a double affliction: besides, after the knowledge of what Perolla has done, he must either hate or love him, if the former, the intricacy is both admirable and obligeing, for the selfesame action makes the Sonne preserve an Enemy and lose a Freind, and the Father lose his revenge upon his Adversary and his affection to his Sonne: If the latter, his being in a Place which forbidds his visits and assistance wilbe no small trouble, and the doubts that I will take away Perolla's life wilbe Pacuvius torment whilst he immagins his Sonne is living, & the knowledge when he is not so, will continue it after he is dead, And since he lives more in Perolla than in himselfe, his vnequall'd treachery will justify my killing the most of him that I can. After many such strange reasonings as these, he drew out a Ponyard and came towards me to act what he had determin'd: I must confesse I was somewhat startl'd at this proceeding, but when I consider'd the aversnesse of his nature was such, that probably I could never obtaine his consent of possessing his excellent Daughter, I had no more the desire than the force to resist him, and therefore just as he came to the Beddside I vncover'd my selfe, and shewing him my naked brest I told him, Here (Sir) this is the place you aime at, and therefore it shall not be defended by me, I am guilty because you thinke me so, and since I am so miserable as to be hated by you, that death which you threaten me with wilbe a justice as to your revenge, and a charity as to my condition. That action & those few words produced a strange effect, for upon a sudden his high disorders began to lessen, his Face to dispell those Clowdes which darkn'd it, and at length fetching a sigh from the bottome of his Brest, he declar'd some expressions to this sence: What, shall an intentionall injury from Pacuvius be more prevalent with thee than a reall obligation from Perolla? shall the first Fruits of that life which thou holdest from his Generosity be to take away his which has given thee thine? Shall he be murther'd because he hinder'd thee from being so? and shall the residue of his blood be spilt by thee when all he has allreaddy lost was shedd for thee? besides, thou deriu'st the advantage thou hast now over him from his protection, for had it not bin for that, thy death had taken from thee the will and the power of revenge: Yes (he continu'd, addressing himselfe to me and sheathing his Ponyard) you shall live Perolla, not only free from any attempt of mine, but secure also from my acquainting Hanniball who you are, from whose resentment you might expect as hard a destiny as from Blacius's, but the services you have done the Romans, and me in perticular binde up my hands. There is (I reply'd) a third way of destroying me as certaine as those two you have exempted me from, and that (Sir) is the denyall of my first request, which to disswade you from I may truly professe, that all that blood which hated you was spilt for you, for which I blesse my Fortune that made me performe what was good by loseing that which was ill. All my new blood I have bred up with such firm inclinations for you, that had it deriv'd its originall from your selfe it could not be more at your devotion: I must acknowledg too the justice of the Gods in makeing me receive those wounds which Pacuvius intended for you, and to divert and reclaime him from such crimminall designes I shall make it my constant Prayers, that they may all have the fate which this had, and that by my sufferings I might prevent all those that are intended you. Blacius at these assurances wholly banisht those cruell lookes which made me soe much suspect my fate, and with an obligeing accent conjur'd me to tell him what use I could make of his condiscending to my desire. I should then (I reply'd) by a continuall succession of services have some hopes to obtaine your permission of makeing my adresses to the faire Izadora. (This I spoake vnadvisedly having fllatter'd my selfe into a beleife that in the temper Blacius was in, I might procure some enguadgment which his generosity (though he should afterwards repent) would not permit him to recall: but alas! I soone found my expectation deceiv'd, for after this declaration, in an instant he arm'd himselfe againe with that severe Countenance he so late had lay'd aside, & with a Tone as cruell as his words he told me, Is Izadora then the object of your designe? 'tis very like indeed I should present hir to his Sonne that executed her Vncle: would have Murther'd hir Father: and who to satisfie a private mallice ha's given up his Country to the Enemyes of it, These truly are obligations to court a Mistris with. Sir (I reply'd somewhat mov'd) you still reproach me with anothers crime, if Magius was put to death to please Hanniball, I made use of it in Pettely to raise him Enemyes: If Blacius life was attempted, I preserv'd it by the hazard of my owne: and if Capua was deliver'd up to the Carthaginians, I became (to him that did it) from a Sonne an Enemy, and so wedded my Countryes Quarrell, that thereby Hanniball lost more Men than perhapps the takeing of that great Citty would have cost him. I must confesse (reply'd Blacius) you have done much for me and for the Romans, & upon both those scores you have receiv'd no vnfruitfull returne, since for those services you did our Empire I preserve you (not without an eminent hazard) from the knowledge of the Enemyes of it: and for what you have done my perticuler, I suspend those resentments which your Fathers Treachery highly invites me to execute, and because my debt to you is a Life, (as I thinke nothing can be a sufficient payment but an obligation of the same nature) so after your receiving that satisfaction, I can be no longer esteem'd indebted to you. Sir (I answer'd) If you will tye your selfe to what your last words now profest I shall as highly approve of your proceeding as of my owne happinesse, but your silencing of your owne resentments and the concealing me from the Carthaginians is no preservation vnlesse you permit me also to be a servant to the faire Izadora: That is the only means to save my life, and without it, all the other you can mention wilbe rather miseries than favours, neither can a man say that he preserves his Enemys life because he exempts him from the Sword or Poyson if at last he makes him dye some other way: what you have promis'd only free's me from two wayes of ruine to cast me into a third that is more certaine & painfull than either: No no Sir (I continu'd) if you banish me from Izadora, the highest effects of yours or Haniballs hatred wilbe pleasing, & cutt me from those languishing torments your refusall will create. I have alredy told you (said Blacius) that you must not expect Izadora, who I will sooner marry to her Grave than to any of your family; but because you shall have no occassion of condemning me of cruelty, I will truly state those obligations you pretend to have conferr'd on me, and those I have really plac'd on you. I acknowledge you sav'd my life, and 'tis likely I deriv'd that obligation from your ignorance, but I did preserve yours after my knowledge of you; You had the invitations of oppressed innocency to procure me your assistance; I had a just revenge to disswade me from pardoning you and yet did it; The glory of your action was your reward, but the mercy of mine may probably prove my punishment: besides what you did for me was no more favour than to drawe me out of a danger wherein you had cast me, for I had not needed the assistance of one of your Family, had not the Trechery of the cheife of it bin the occasion; so that you can never mention the obligation you did me without discovering your Fathers infamy. As you sav'd me from murthering, so you hinder'd Pacuvius from being a Murtherer. You preserv'd my life from being a sacrifice to violence, but by it you hinder'd your Fathers from being one to Iustice, and whilst you only defeated him of his revenge, you exempted him both from the guilt and punishment of it: so that you have oblig'd Pacuvius more than me. And since you pleaded that an others Crime ought not to be accompted yours; so your virtues ought not to be attributed to your Family, to which I am so irreconsilable an Enemy, that it lyes not in the power of any one of it to reconcile me to it. No young man (he continu'd) after what I have done, you cannot condemne me of ingratitude without practiceing your selfe what you would blame in me. Sir (I reply'd) though I beleive I could answer all your objections, yet the meanes I must take to cleare those already mention'd will create a greater than any I shall confute, which is my disputeing against you, but if all those arguments you use, be to proove your denying me Izadora, is not an effect of your ingratitude, but your justice, I will aboundantly confesse it, and declare besides, if you fancy otherwise you doe as great a wrong to me, as you doe to my felicity in refuseing my passionate desires. I had no sooner ended those words, but that Blacius calling the faire Izadora (who had bin present at all this dispute, and in whose Face you might have knowne the severall tempers of it) & told her, I am glad Perolla acknowledges my depriveing him of his happinesse is an action of Iustice, I hope then no man can condemne my Revenge when justice concurrs with my inclination to conferr it on me; I doe therefore (Izadora) conjure thee by those wrongs his Family has done owrs, by thy Vncle Magius blood which Pacuvius sacrific'd to his hatred, by they Fathers life, which he would have distroy'd upon the same score, and by the glory of so fitting a revenge, scorne his Flame, and let him finde in thy hatred, the punishment of his Fathers to all thy Family. At this cruell command the perfect Izadora became white as Innocence, and after her disorder was a little past, casting downe her Eyes to the ground, shee thus reply'd, Alas (Sir) your commands are come too late, for before I knew who he was, I gave him so large an Empire over me, that 'tis impossible to recall it; neither when I consider him bath'd in blood for your preservation, rejoyceing at his wounds because they hinder'd you from any that were dangerous, loseing his Father to preserve his Fathers Enemy, and when you assur'd me you would judge of my affection to you by that I should pay him, I cannot repent what I have done, My Freindship for Perolla is deriv'd from my obedience to you, and my gratitude to him, who can then condemne a production from such noble Causes? besides, he has nothing that's Enemy to us but his name, his actions are not, for by them I enjoy a Father, can you then have so lowe an opinion of my resentments as to beleive any consideraton can make me hate the Giver of so great a blessing? if then my affection for him be a sinne, you will I hope pardon it by the knowledge of what occasions it. I doe therefore (Sir) conjure you, by that pretious life you owe his Gallantry, By the blood of Magius he has so generously reveng'd, by those services he has pay'd our Empire, and by the glory you will purchase by vanquishing your Enemy (as you tear me him) without revenge; permitt Perolla to divest you of that prejudicate opinion you have for all his Family, or to assume a confidence by his repeated services to remove that high aversion you have for his vnfortunate extraction. Though these words in themselves were strangely moveing, yet they were deliver'd with an action & tone so compassionate & ravishing, that noe heart which had not bin harder than Cruelty it selfe, could have resisted them. But alas, they were so farre from produceing any good effects, that Blacius with a looke that had all things of horrid in it told her, Are you then so desirous to displease me, that to effect it you will become a freind to your Fathers Enemy that you may become an Enemy to him? will you ruine my happinesse to create Perolla's? and will you shew me the way to be reveng'd on his cruell Family, and then hinder me from acting it? must that which deprives me of my revenge deprive me of my Daughter too? must the cause why I doe not punish my Enemy be as great a misfortune to me, as that is which he avoydes? & to increase my trouble must your affectio & duty to me (which were my highest felicity) be the occasion of my proportionate misery? Ah Izadora (he continu'd, for I will no longer call you daughter) will you then bestowe your selfe upon this Perolla, when even now he declar'd, that to be deny'd you was just? doe you love injustice so well that in one action you wilbe vnjust to Blacius, and to his Enemyes? and will you make such haste to pay a debt that is not due by declining one that is? goe barbarus Mayde, vnworthy of my care (aswell as blood) I will inflict on thee noe greater punishment than the graunting thy desires, For when thy reason, or his embraces, has banish't or quencht thy impious flame, thou wilt knowe and deplore thy sinne in preferreing a Lover before a Father, goe then, but for ever, and may'st thou never know what happinesse is but avoyde it. Finishing these words he went out of the Chamber, and left us in a perplexity as great as his disorders. But before I could speake to the faire cause of them, he return'd againe, & thus continu'd his discourse to his excellent Daughter, No, no, I have thought better on't, for to crosse a desire though it be an ill one is a revenge, & 'tis upon that score you shall never see Perolla more, for whome if you continue your Passion, you shall finde from my Iustice (in separating you) as severe an affliction, as I can resent from your want of duty by your Vnion: doe not thinke to divest me from this determination, for all your Teares & Prayers wilbe as fruitlesse for your Lover, as mine to you were against him. (Then addressing himselfe to me he said) And Thou (cruell Stranger) which by saveing my Life hast made it my Torment, and for my vnfortunate care in bringing thee here to heale thy wounds, hast created asmuch misery in my Family as there had bin joy in thine had thy Father murther'd me, Remember assoone as my Chyrurgions tell thee thou art fitt to travell, that thou quitt my house, for if thou stay'st a minuite longer, by that quiet thou hast rob'd me of I'le Sacrifice thy Life unto my just resentments. Then thrusting the faire Izadora out before him, he went away in a rage almost equall to mine at that inhuman action. I will not tell you (said Perolla to Spartacus) all those expressions my greife and anger extorted from me, whose greatnesse you may in some sorte gesse, when I assure you I was so blinded with rage, that I made many crimminall designes against his Life which was so much an Enemy to mine, & had not my weaknesse hinder'd me, I had perhapps attempted that which if perform'd, had made me worthy of all those miseries his hate has inflicted on me, But after this first heate was qualify'd, the consideration that he was Izadora's Father banisht those crimminall resolutions, and struck me with so deepe a Greife, that my repentance had like to have prov'd his revenge. But (to be breife) Srato (for so was my servant call'd that follow'd me into Salapia) never left inquireing after me 'till by his diligence he had gotten some suspitions that 'twas I which had sav'd Blacius, & was carry'd by him into his house, therfore to satisfy himselfe, by a considerable Present, he obtain'd leave from one of my Chyrurgions to attend him as his Servant, where when my wounds were next drest he discover'd what he sought, and himselfe to me. I was not a litle overjoy'd by the findeing out so faithfull a Servant, and having acquainted him with those severall accidents which had befallen me since our separation, I enjoyn'd him to trye if he could possibly learne some way how I might see Izadora, or convey a Letter to her; but though his industry left nothing vnessay'd, yet it prov'd absolutely fruitlesse, for Blacius had so faithfull and strict a watch about her, that 'twas impossible to corupt or deceive them. But to increase the misery I then groan'd vnder, Strato (one day) told me, Pacuvius had discover'd where my retreate was, & how I had endanger'd my owne Life to preserve his Enemyes, with which he was so inrag'd, that he commanded him to tell me, as I had divested my selfe of all duty to him, so he had done the like of all affection to me, and that if I had any reliques of respect for him, I should shew it by never comeing into his sight againe: he further told me, that Pacuvius had once determin'd to acquaint Hanniball how Blacius conceal'd his Enemy, but that the feare of my ruine which would be involu'd in Blacius's had restrain'd him. You may well beleive that this was no small accession to my trouble, and truely I thinke had not I had so great a support as my beleife of Izadora's affection and constancy, I had sunke vnder the weight of my Misfortunes. At last through the great care Blacius Servants had of me, whether it proceeded from his generosity to hasten the regaining of that health I had lost for him, or from his revenge to banish me the sooner from being neere Izadora: in spigh of the indisposition of my Minde that fatall day came wherein the Chyrurgions told me I might vndertake a journy without any paine or danger, o! how I curst their skill that separated me from my desires, and how much more I had valu'd their Ignorance than their Arte, Before I went away I sent Strato to Blacius, to know if he would permit me to waite on him, & make him those retributions which his care for my recovery meritted; but he sent me word, my absence more than my presence would better discharge any debt I pretended to owe him, & that I could not more oblige him than by a sudden departure from that house which I had flung into so many disorders. I obey'd this cruell Message, and that Night (for I durst not stirre by day least I might have bin discoverd) I quitted Blacius's house, neither did I visit Pacuvius, who I was willing should see I would disobey him in nothing, since I did it not in an injunction so opposite to my duty & inclination. I had not retir'd an hower in a Freinds house when I call'd Strato to me & told him I was resolv'd before I left Salapia, to see the faire Izadora, which I fancy'd could not be very difficult, since shee lay (for the cooleness of the Lodging, it being then Summer) in a lower Chamber next the Garden. Strato who consider'd my safety above my satisfactio earnestly though vainely disswaded me from it, therefore we went silently to the Garden dore which answerd on a bye-lane, there having pick't the lock I got in, & was conducted by Strato to that Windowe where he assur'd me Izadora lay I Comanded him then to returne & give me warning if he should discover any thing worthy my knowledge: he was no sooner gone but I walk't softly to the place he had directed me too, lest some Company might have bin with her, but as the Gods would have it shee was all alone (having retir'd her selfe into hir Closet which was joyning to her Chamber) there looking in, I discover'd her by the light of a small Taper, siting on a Chaire, leaneing her Cheeke upon one hand and wipeing her Teares off with the other. I was amaz'd to finde her in such a posture, but suddenly my wonder was turn'd into Ioy (at lest as much as I was capable of when shee was so drown'd in sorrow) findeing by her discourse that I was the object of hirs. Alas (shee said accompanying her words with a heavy sigh) perhaps at this instant that I only but deplore Perolla's absence, I may have cause to lament his death through Blacius cruelty, by acting himselfe his Revenge, or by giving Hanniball the meanes to doe it. Wretched Izadora! must the not knowing whether thou art miserable make thy misery? & must thy doubts of being vnfortunate render thee really so? No no, I feare they are not only bare suspitions makes me thus vnhappy, but that my Eyes weepe by prophecie what they must shortly by evidence. I must confesse said Perolla though it were a crime thus to intrench upon her retirment, yet I found in that sinne a more obliging joy than I could in the reward of virtve; and doubtlesse I had longer continu'd my transgression had I not thought it a greater to leave hir in a sadnesse I could so soone remove. Therefore making a litle noyse I told her, Madam, if your apprehensions for Perolla be the blest and sadd cause of your Teares, you may now silence them, since he is in a condition of apprehending nothing but your disdaine. Never to my remembrance did I see so strange a surprize as those words were to that excellent Beauty to whome they were spoken, who though shee a long tyme nicely consider'd me yet could shee not fancy I was Perolla, for her Father (to destroy that Freindship shee honor'd me with) had given her so much cause to despaire for my Life, that her sence could not convince her beleife I was living, But at length her disorder was so farre supprest, that comeing to the Window shee ask't me softly, whether I was really what I pretended to be? and if I were, what made me so evidently indanger my life and consequently hirs? Madam (I reply'd) I am the happy Perolla (that which I have heard since I came to this place, makes me assume that title) and I am come to knowe how you will dispose of a Life which you are pleas'd to be so much concern'd in. You live then Gallant Perolla (shee said) & Blacius after all his threatnings has preserv'd your Life. No Madam (I answer'd) 'tis not Blacius but Izadora which has done it, that glorious confession shee made him in my favour was the essentiall cause of it, all that Blacius did, was, that he kill'd me not, but 'twas his vnequall'd Daughter gave me my Life by giving me that which makes me value it, & I should be more vnworthy the guift had the apprehension of any danger hinderd me from acknowledging at her Feete, that as I hold it by her, so I will only preserve & imploy it for her. If (said Izadora) you had given me so large an Empire over you before this visit, I should have enjoyn'd you to trust my justice in beleiveing your goodnesse, rather than thus hazard your safety for the expressing of it. Madam (I reply'd) I should more indanger it by going away without assuring you of this duty than I doe in the paying of it, for that might have ruin'd me in your good opinion, which I more feare than all that my Enemyes can act against me. You are (shee answer'd) so deeply fixt in my esteeme, that hardly any action of yours much lesse one which hinder'd you from danger, can prejudice you in it. But faire Izadora (I reply'd) may not your Fathers hatred, my vnfortunate extraction, and my owne vnworthinesse raise your Iustice to the suppression of your present Mercy and the ruine of my Felicity? Ah Perolla (shee answer'd with a litle Blush) can you then suspect my constancy? silence I beseech you all such doubts, for you neede not feare I will comit a fault in the which I shall finde my punishment; neither can you beleive I will preferre any other before you without doing as great a wrong to my judgement as my happinesse: but (shee continu'd) may not I (Perolla) suspect, that Blacius cruelty may induce you to withdrawe your Passion from his Daughter? & that your revenge may be more predominant than your affection? Madam (I reply'd) I attest the Gods if my words have given you the least doubt that I fear'd you would prove inconstant they did not expresse my meaning, for if I have any suspition, 'tis not of your virtue but of my Felicity; & if I were jellous of your change, I am not so rude or partiall to my selfe, as to call that your inconstancy which would be but your justice; but if I had had any suspitions of that nature, what you have bin pleas'd to say would make me rather cherish than condemne them, since they are the cause of my receiveing assurances of an affection as farre transcending my hope as my desert. As to those doubts you mention'd of your Fathers hatred raiseing any resentments in me; I attest the selfe same powers I even now invoak't, that as long as I am blest with your esteeme I can be capable neither of misfortune nor change, & though I have lost Pacuvius & Blacius, yet when I consider what I have thereby obtain'd I shall never repent the purchase. Wee had certainly past the Night away in so pleasing a conversation had not Izadora's woman interrupted it by knocking at the Closet Dore & telling her, That Blacius at his comeing home (for he was then abroad) would doubtlesse visite her, & if he found hir up at so vnseasonable an houre, it might raise suspitions which would hardly be supprest. This fatall sommons I receiv'd with extreme reluctancy, but Izadora who knew the truth of it, & who aprehended my discovery, told me 'twas tyme to retire, & having made me a thousand protestations of her constancy, shee strictly forbad me any such hazardous visits, injoyning me to goe into the Roman Army, & indeavour there to get Freinds strong enough to suppresse her Fathers aversion for me: Then having settl'd an addresse for our Letters, I kist her faire hands, & resign'd the office of my words unto my Teares, which only assur'd her how cruell I esteemd that separation. 'Twas in this sort Sir (continu'd Perolla) that we contracted an Affectio
