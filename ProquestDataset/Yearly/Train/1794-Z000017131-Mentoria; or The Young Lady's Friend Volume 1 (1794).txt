If it is true that "Good wine needs no bu[s]h, and a good play no Epilogue," then mu[s]t it be equally certain, that a good book requires no preface---and this affertion acknowledged to be true, in what an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-005.jpg) \- external link  - Page ii. ] awkward predicament do I [s]tand, [s]ince to publi[s]h this work without a preface, will be tacitly to infer, that it is good and needs no recommendation, and [s]o be de[s]ervedly cen[s]ured as a conceited [s]cribler. Should I write a preface and condemn the performance, confe[s]s it has innumerable faults, and reque[s]t the reader's pity and patience, I not only prepo[s][s]e[s]s them again[s]t it, but acknowledge my[s]elf an idiot, for [s]uffering it to meet the public eye, in [s]uch an imperfect [s]tate. What then am I to [s]ay, or how fill up tho[s]e few pages nece[s][s]ary to be placed at the beginning of a book? Shall I tell the reader my de[s]ign in publi[s]hing the[s]e volumes? I will; It was an anxious de[s]ire to [s]ee all my dear country-women as truly amiable as they are univer[s]ally acknowledged beautiful; it was a wi[s]h to convince [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-006.jpg) \- external link  - Page iii. ] them that true happine[s]s can never be met with in the temple of di[s][s]ipation and folly, [s]he [s]lies the glare of fa[s]hion, and the midnight revel, and dwells only in the heart con[s]cious of performing its duty, and is the con[s]tant companion of tho[s]e, who, content with the [s]tation in which it has plea[s]ed Providence to place them, entirely free from envy or malice, make it their whole [s]tudy to cultivate tho[s]e amiable virtues which will render them at once beloved, admired and e[s]teemed, by all who know them. Whether I have executed this de[s]ign well or ill, mu[s]t be hereafter determined, not only by tho[s]e partial friends who[s]e kind encouragement prompted me to [s]ubmit the[s]e pages to the inspection of the public; but, a-well-a-day for me, I mu[s]t al[s]o be judged by [s]ome [s]age critic, who, "with [s]pectacle on , and pouch by's [s]ide," with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-007.jpg) \- external link  - Page iv. ] lengthened vi[s]age and contemptuous [s]mile, [s]its down to review the literary productions of a woman .

I have taken the liberty of placing a poem at the beginning of the work, which was publi[s]hed [s]ome few years [s]ince in the novel Victoria, and as many parents utterly forbid their daughters reading any of that [s]pecies of writing, I thought I [s]hould readily be for introducing it here.

Who[s]e tongue to [s]lander ne'er was prone, Who makes your joys and griefs her own, Prize her, for 'tis from bounteous heav'n, The choice[s]t gift that can be giv'n.

He was, at an early age, married to the daughter of a reputable trade[s]man, who preferring the hard[s]hips of war, to a [s]eparation from her hu[s]band, re[s]olutely followed him to every campaign. It was at the [s]iege of Quebec, that our gallant veteran was wounded and left dead on the field: his faithful partner, unable to [s]upport the [s]hocking tidings which were abruptly conveyed to her, fell into premature labour, and in giving birth to a female infant, rendered up her own life. Colonel Dormer was acquainted with the circumstance, and determined to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] taken, reque[s]ting [s]he would permit the little Helena to be [s]ent over to be educated with her daughters. Her lady[s]hip acquie[s]ced, and Helena arrived [s]afe in England, when only two years old, and was immediately admitted into the nur[s]ery among the little Winworths, and as [s]he grew up enjoyed with them the benefit of a polite and liberal education. The young Lord Winworth, as he advanced towards manhood, could not behold the young orphan without [s]ome emotions of tenderne[s]s. Helena was plea[s]ing in her per[s]on, and elegant in her manners, but [s]he was endowed with di[s]cernment and [s]en[s]e far [s]uperior to the generality of young women of her age. She po[s][s]e[s][s]ed [s]en[s]ibility enough to be unable to li[s]ten with coldne[s]s and inattention to the ardent profe[s][s]ions of a young nobleman, who to the advantages of birth and fortune, added a prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ing figure, and every polite accomplishment---but [s]he knew that he was extremely young, and that, in all probability, however eager at that time to enter into indi[s][s]oluble engagements, he would hereafter repent his precipitancy, and regret that he had not matched with one more [s]uitable in rank and fortune. She al[s]o reflected that [s]he [s]hould, by accepting him, disappoint the hopes of his mother, and prove herself ungrateful to a woman who had ever treated her with maternal tenderne[s]s. "And [s]hall I," [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] [s]aid [s]he, "for the gratification of a pa[s][s]ion "which has perhaps aro[s]e from childi[s]h fondne[s]s, "and only gains [s]trength by not being oppo[s]ed, "entail on my[s]elf the anger of my be[s]t benefac "tors, and lay my[s]elf open to the [s]neers of the "world, by matching [s]o far above my expecta "tions, nay, will not my hu[s]band be laughed at "for rai[s]ing a poor orphan to his rank and title. "I am determined to [s]tifle this ri[s]ing pa[s][s]ion, "and to inform my Lady of the unfortunate at "tachment of her [s]on." This judicious re[s]olution [s]he immediately put in execution. Lady Winworth li[s]tened to her with a mixture of [s]urpri[s]e and admiration. "My dear Helena," [s]aid [s]he, "you [s]hall never want a friend while I exi[s]t. This generous conduct has rendered you more amiable than ever. My [s]on is but a boy, I will [s]end him abroad, and in all human probability a few years [s]pent at [s]ome of the gaye[s]t Courts in Europe, will entirely eradicate this youthful penchant ." When the young gentleman was informed of his mother's de[s]ire that he [s]hould travel, he flew to Helena, and earne[s]tly entreated her to con[s]ent to a private marriage before his departure. She laughed at his importunity, though her little heart was ready to rebel, and [s]he found to laugh (however repugnant to her feelings) was the only way [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] to avoid an affecting interview. Her mirth piqued him. "You do not love me, Helena," [s]aid he. "I never told you I did, my Lord." "But your looks, your actions, have contributed to make me think you did." "Why, my good Lord," [s]aid [s]he [s]miling, "I do love you mo[s]t affectionately, and wi[s]h for nothing more than to [s]ee you happy." "Then why not con[s]ent to our immediate union?" cried he eagerly." "Becau[s]e I love you as a brother, and hope to [s]ee you, when you return, married to [s]ome lady of birth, merit, and fortune, and to figure as bride-maid on the occasion." "Unaccountable girl," [s]aid he, peevishly, "then only promi[s]e me to remain [s]ingle till my return." "Indeed I [s]hall not, my Lord, for I have no intention to wear a willow garland; and [s]ure I am, that [s]hould I make [s]uch a promi[s]e, we [s]hould both repent it before the year was out." "Nay, Madam," [s]aid he, angrily, "if you are of [s]o light a di[s]po[s]ition-----" "It is even [s]o," cried [s]he, with affected vivacity, "therefore, as you are warned, pray beware, and think no more of [s]o trifling and incon[s]tant a character." When Helena retired to her own apartment, [s]he gave free vent to her feelings; and in order to avoid the pain of parting, reque[s]ted permi[s][s]ion of Lady Winworth, to pay a vi[s]it to a young lady, who lived [s]ome miles from town. The old Lady [s]aw the propriety of her reque[s]t, and immediately [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] granted it. She therefore departed the next morning, leaving only a card, wi[s]hing his lord[s]hip health and much plea[s]ure in the cour[s]e of his travels. So [s]triking a proof of her indifference increased his re[s]entment, and he left England without any of tho[s]e pangs which he imagined he [s]hould [s]uffer when [s]eparated from his Helena. The event proved that Helena was right; for when Lord Winworth returned, he brought with him a bride, lovely, amiable, and his equal in rank and fortune. When his lord[s]hip left England, he took with him a young gentleman, as a travelling companion; this gentleman did not [s]ee Helena previous to his departure, but at his return, charmed with her innocent vivacity and judicious conduct, reque[s]ted permi[s][s]ion to pay his addre[s][s]es; which was immediately granted, and on their union he was pre[s]ented with a po[s]t under government, which he enjoyed till his death. Helena being then left in rather [s]traitened circumstances, was reque[s]ted to become governe[s]s to the daughters of Lord Winworth; [s]he con[s]ented, on condition that they might be permitted to retire with her into the country. His lord[s]hip purcha[s]ed a [s]mall e[s]tate in Wales, and thither [s]he retired with her young charge. On the death of his wife, Lord Winworth [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] requested her to bring his girls to town, and become their conductor in public, as [s]he had been their in private: but this [s]he re[s]olutely refused. On the [s]eparation of the young ladies from their kind, almo[s]t maternal friend, they reque[s]ted a continued corre[s]pondence might be kept up between them. Mentoria was the appellation they had ever given her, and under this name was the corre[s]pondence commenced. As her letters are inter[s]per[s]ed with entertaining tales appo[s]ite to the [s]ubjects on which [s]he wrote, I have avoided giving any of the young ladies' letters, as they would only prove an interruption to the general de[s]ign. Mentoria, to the Miss Winworths. After being accu[s]tomed to the [s]ociety of my dear Mi[s]s Winworths for fifteen years, how [s]olitary and comfortle[s]s is my [s]ituation. I every day feel my lo[s]s more [s]everely. I look at the  and expect my Sophia to come and practi[s]e her favorite le[s][s]ons. I take up a book, and almo[s]t unknown to my[s]elf, call on Emily to read [s]ome pa[s][s]age that plea[s]es or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] interests me. I mi[s]s the dear lively [s]allies of Gertrude, and the innocent prattle of Letitia: but though I [s]o [s]everely feel the privation of your beloved [s]ociety, I am not [s]o [s]elfi[s]h as to wi[s]h you again in the [s]hades of Cambray. I am certain of the nece[s][s]ity of your taking a part in the active [s]cenes of life, and as your dear mother is now no more, your father will nece[s][s]arily require the cheerfulne[s]s of his children to brighten his solitary hours, and it was but ju[s]t that my beloved girls [s]hould appear in the [s]tation they were born to ornament. I highly commend the prudence of your father, in taking Mrs. Clairville into his family, to be your chaperone on your fir[s]t entrance into fa[s]hionable circles. She is a woman who has [s]een a great deal of polite life, has ever retained an unblemi[s]hed reputation, and though reduced by misfortune to be glad to accept the [s]ituation your father offered her, has ever been received as a gue[s]t who[s]e pre[s]ence conferred an obligation, by [s]ome of the fir[s]t families in England. Though [s]eparated from you, I [s]hall, as you de[s]ire, [s]till continue your preceptre[s]s, and [s]hall not at any time [s]cruple to tell you of your faults; for partial as I am to your virtues, I am by no means blind to tho[s]e errors to which human nature is  [s]ubject, and which, if not timely [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] eradicated, will gain an a[s]cendancy over your mind, and entirely hide tho[s]e amiable qualities, which at pre[s]ent form the mo[s]t [s]triking traits in your character. And to begin---I feel my[s]elf greatly hurt and offended by the letter I received from Gertrude, [s]ince your arrival in London. When it was fir[s]t delivered into my hands, a joyful [s]en[s]ation diffused it[s]elf over my heart, and while reading the tender expre[s][s]ions of grateful affection that [s]eemed to flow [s]pontaneous from your pen, it expanded with plea[s]ure; but when I came to the[s]e words, "My father received us with great affection, and has been very bountiful in pre[s]ents, cloaths, pocket-money, &c. but yet for all that, my dear Madam, I cannot feel that perfect affection for him, which I know I ought. He has a great many peculiarities, [s]ome of them by no means pleasing; and my [s]i[s]ters all agree, he is very much of the Ba[s]haw." Good Heavens! [s]aid I, and is this all the fruit I am likely to reap from the pains I have taken to in[s]til into the minds of tho[s]e dear girls a ju[s]t idea of what is meant by the words, Filial Duty. That the very fir[s]t letter I receive [s]hould point at the little foibles of a parent, who they acknowledge received them with affection, and has been extremely bountiful to them. Believe me, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] my dear children, if you wi[s]h to pa[s]s through life with any degree of plea[s]ure to your[s]elves, you mu[s]t early learn to [s]ubmit, without murmuring, to the will of your father; be blind to his errors, or if they are [s]o glaring that you cannot avoid [s]eeing them, never expo[s]e them, or [s]uffer others to [s]peak di[s]re[s]pectfully of him in your pre[s]ence. You mu[s]t [s]acrifice your own wi[s]hes to his, you mu[s]t [s]tudy his happine[s]s and ea[s]e, and in [s]o doing will mo[s]t  promote your own. You no doubt remember the amiable Mrs. Railton, who favored me with her company for a few weeks la[s]t [s]ummer. I ye[s]terday received news of her death, and as I am certain example is ever more efficacious than precept, I will give you a [s]light [s]ketch of her hi[s]tory, as a model by which every young woman who wi[s]hes to promote her own felicity, will regulate her conduct. Mr. George Campbell was the  [s]on of a wealthy baronet, who having [s]everal livings in his gift, be[s]ides good intere[s]t at Court, brought him up to the church, with the [s]anguine expectation of one day [s]eeing him a bi[s]hop. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] Unfortunately for George, before he had attained his twenty-third year he became attached to a young lady, who had every requi[s]ite to render the married [s]tate happy, but money--- and money being the old gentleman's darling idol, he con[s]equently thought [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed no requi[s]ite worthy the wife of his [s]on; but George was too far engaged to retreat with honor, he therefore told his father, he was re[s]olved upon the union, and in a few days pre[s]ented his beloved Loui[s]a to entreat his ble[s][s]ing. When Sir James found they were really married, he thought it was in vain to fly in a pa[s][s]ion, he received them cordially, and gave them an univer[s]al invitation to his hou[s]e, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings were disposed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his e[s]tates to his elde[s]t [s]on. Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year came round, his wife pre[s]ented him with a child. Poverty took up her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of disobedience, not only brought on him[s]elf his father's di[s]plea[s]ure, but involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a [s]cene of penury and di[s]tre[s]s. The[s]e reflections four'd his di[s]po[s]ition, he became peevi[s]h and moro[s]e, nay [s]ometimes went [s]o far, as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] to reproach his wife as the cau[s]e of his abject situation. Mrs. Campbell took great care to in[s]til into the minds of her children the re[s]pect and affection due from them to their father. "My dear children," [s]he would often [s]ay, "be a[s][s]ured, a breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret, and in general with misfortune." Loui[s]a was the elde[s]t of five children, [s]he was mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively li[s]tened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her heart as an ine[s]timable trea[s]ure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew [s]o extremely bad, that not only his wife, but his children came in for a [s]hare of his ill-humour. Loui[s]a, in particular, was [s]ure to be wrong, in whatever [s]he [s]aid or did, and it was [s]eldom [s]he was favoured with a kind or affectionate word, yet her manners were [s]o amiable and her form [s]o lovely, that though [s]he laboured under the di[s]advantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was courted by [s]ome of the genteele[s]t families in the village, but in compliance with her father's ill-humour, [s]he was [s]eldom allowed to [s]tir from home. When Loui[s]a had reached her [s]eventeenth year, Lady Mary Campbell, a di[s]tant relation of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] father's, came on a vi[s]it to a family who re[s]ided in the [s]ame village. Loui[s]a's good qualities were re[s]ounded to Lady Mary from every mouth, and all unanimou[s]ly agreed it was a pity [s]o lovely a girl [s]hould be buried in ob[s]curity, and lo[s]t for want of a proper education. Lady Mary was naturally of a humane disposition, [s]he expre[s][s]ed a de[s]ire to [s]ee Mi[s]s Campbell, and when introduced to her, finding her even superior to what [s]he had been taught to expect, made her an offer of going with her to London. This was a propo[s]al too much to Loui[s]a's advantage to be refu[s]ed; the invitation was accepted, and the vi[s]it prolonged for three years, during which time Loui[s]a had an opportunity of improving her[s]elf in the ornamental as well as useful branches of education. Mrs. Campbell, who had for many years laboured under an evident decline, was now summoned home by that power, who had been plea[s]ed in this life to try her with long and heavy afflictions. Lady Mary carried Loui[s]a to receive the dying ble[s][s]ing, and pay the la[s]t duties to her amiable mother.---That fini[s]hed, [s]he propo[s]ed her return to London. The lovely girl, penetrated with gratitude for the many favours [s]he had received and tenderly attached to her generous [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] benefactress, with difficulty re[s]trained her tears, while [s]he thus addre[s][s]ed her--- "Think me not ungrateful, dear Madam, if I beg to remain with my father; my brothers and [s]i[s]ters are engaged in learning occupations which may enable them to pa[s]s through life with industry and without reproach. I cannot leave my father in this [s]olitude after [s]o recent an affliction: he has been for many years u[s]ed to the unremitting attention and tenderne[s]s of my excellent mother, I mu[s]t not [s]uffer him too [s]everely to feel her lo[s]s, but endeavour, as far as in my power, by affection and affiduity, to [s]upply her place." "And can you, my dear Loui[s]a, [s]aid her Ladyship, [s]o ea[s]ily forego the ea[s]e and plenty you have enjoyed with me, to live a life of penury and labour, and that for a man, who, though he is your father, I mu[s]t [s]ay, does not de[s]erve [s]uch attention--- did he not always treat you with unmerited har[s]hne[s]s?" "Hold, my dear Madam," [s]aid Loui[s]a; "if, as you think, my father has not behaved to me with the kindne[s]s of a parent, it by no means releases me from my duty to him; had he a thousand errors he is my father [s]till; as [s]uch I am called upon by nature and religion to do every [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] thing in my power to render his life comfortable; it my endeavours to plea[s]e can awaken his affection I [s]hall think my[s]elf amply repaid; if not, the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of having performed my duty, will give me a [s]atisfaction which no future event can ever rob me of." It was in vain Lady Mary urged her to return--- the lovely, elegant, accompli[s]hed Loui[s]a, preferred a low roofed man[s]ion, [s]canty meals, and attendance on a [s]ick peevi[s]h father, to the lofty apartments, plenteous table, and variety of amusements [s]he might have enjoyed with Lady Mary. She attended him to the la[s]t, and by her tender solicitude and affection [s]moothed the down-hill of his life, and cheared and comforted him in the mo[s]t painful illne[s]s by her unaffected piety; he was moved by her filial duty, all the father ru[s]hed upon his [s]oul, he ble[s][s]ed her with his parting breath, and expired in her arms. You may, perhaps, enquire, what benefit Louisa reaped from this rigid performance of her duty? The que[s]tion is ea[s]ily an[s]wered. She gained a contented happy mind, [s]erenity dwelt in her heart and chearfulne[s]s beamed from her eyes. She had a genteel competency left her at Lady Mary's death, married a de[s]erving man, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] [s]hone as con[s]picuou[s]ly in the characters of a wife and mother, as [s]he had done as a daughter---[s]he lived beloved by all and died univer[s]ally regretted. Be wife, my dear children, follow Loui[s]a's example, [s]o [s]hall your lives be happy and your la[s]t moments peace. MENTORIA. I am [s]orry, my dear ladies to be under the disagreeable nece[s][s]ity of again taking up my pen to reprove. Your letters to me of late, have arrived [s]o seldom, and when they do arrive, are [s]o [s]hort, [s]o filled with dre[s]s, vi[s]its, and parties of plea[s]ure, that I almo[s]t doubt whether [s]ome demon has not imitated your hand-writing, to impo[s]e upon me; for I can find no ve[s]tige of tho[s]e [s]entiments I [s]o anxiou[s]ly [s]trove to inculcate in your minds while in the [s]hades of Cambray: from the tenor of your letters, I [s]hould imagine you live entirely in a crowd, if [s]o, you certainly have no time to attend to tho[s]e improvements I [s]o [s]trongly recommended to you not to neglect. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] You [s]eem al[s]o to have taken an unaccountable di[s]like to Mrs. Clairville. You [s]ay your father is a great deal too partial to her; this appears to me the evident effect of envy or jealou[s]y; your father being perfectly [s]en[s]ible of that lady's merit, and con[s]cious that her [s]ituation in his family is rather humiliating, by treating her with uncommon re[s]pect, [s]hews the goodne[s]s of his heart, and [s]ets an example which I [s]hould rejoice to find my dear girls would follow. Another thing which [s]eriou[s]ly alarms me for your future happine[s]s is, to find you have your friends and [s]ecrets, and form little cotteries, of which neither your father nor Mrs. Clairville have any knowledge; believe me, you cannot be too cautious in the choice of your intimates, many a girl, who[s]e intentions have been perfectly innocent, has lo[s]t her reputation, by a[s][s]ociating with women who[s]e levity has rendered their characters [s]u[s]picious. You cannot find in the whole circle of your acquaintance, a friend [s]o [s]incere as your natural parent, to him you may without re[s]erve, communicate every wi[s]h of your hearts, for tru[s]t me, when I [s]ay, every thought you would he[s]itate to reveal to a parent, mu[s]t be totally improper to be harboured in your bo[s]om. Perhaps you will tell me, that having no mother, there are [s]ome emotions of the heart, which the natural timidity and delicacy of your [s]ex would render it extremely painful to communicate to a father. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] As I am [s]en[s]ible of the truth of this a[s][s]ertion, I mu[s]t recommend to you to chu[s]e a friend from among tho[s]e mo[s]t e[s]teemed by your father, let her be [s]ome years older than your[s]elf, (for age, in general, learn experience in the arts of the world) and by her advice, [s]he may, in [s]ome mea[s]ure guard you from [s]alling a prey to the di[s][s]imulation of many pretenders to love or friend[s]hip, who will a[s][s]ume the [s]emblance of attachment, to draw the un[s]u[s]pecting youthful heart into improper connections, which too often terminate in their ruin. A numerous acquaintance is, in general, of dangerous con[s]equence to young women, as it is impo[s][s]ible but in a multiplicity of characters there may be [s]ome, who[s]e conver[s]ation and example it would be improper to follow, and [s]uch is the frail [s]tate of human nature, that bad habits are ea[s]ily contracted, and can [s]eldom if ever be eradicated. A girl ju[s]t entering the [s]tate of womanhood, especially if [s]he is po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of any per[s]onal or mental accompli[s]hments, and of an open ingenuous temper is [s]urrounded with innumerable dangers; her reputation is of as delicate a texture, and may be as ea[s]ily injured, as the faire[s]t blo[s][s]om; the malignant whi[s]perings of envy, or the pe[s]ti[s]erous breath of [s]lander, may in an in[s]tant bla[s]t it; it will droop under the keen eye of [s]u[s]picion, and too often tho[s]e who mo[s]t pretend to admire its [s]weets, will rudely pluck it from its parent [s]talk, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] deprive it of all its beauties, then throw it from them like a loath[s]ome weed, leave it to peri[s]h unpitied and unregarded, and to be trod to the earth by every unfeeling pa[s][s]enger, who may perhaps ca[s]t on it a look of contempt, and cry, "Behold the once lovely." There are many women in the world lovely in their per[s]ons, elegant and engaging in their manners, who are yet very improper connections for girls, who wi[s]h to pre[s]erve their reputation un[s]ullied; of this de[s]cription I greatly fear your favorite Matilda is----the [s]trong di[s]like [s]he expresses at the idea of your bringing either your father or Mrs. Clairville to [s]ee her, convinces me there mu[s]t be [s]omething in her character which [s]he would not like to have di[s]covered. Remember it was at a public ball you fir[s]t formed an acquaintance with her; that a gentleman introduced her to you, and chance afterwards led you in a morning excur[s]ion to ride by her little chateau; you confe[s]s [s]he lives in an elegant manner, that [s]he is highly accompli[s]hed, and yet is always by her[s]elf. Would any woman of character and fortune, do you think, live thus recluse, have no female friends to a[s][s]ociate with, no little chearful parties to enliven her [s]olitude, and when [s]he went into public, would [s]he go only accompanied by gentlemen? You [s]ay there is an air of my[s]tery about her; and, believe me, if [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] that my[s]tery was developed, it would di[s]cover nothing to her advantage. Let me intreat my dear girls to drop the acquaintance, or inform your father of it: if after a proper enquiry concerning her character, he [s]hould approve the continuation of your vi[s]its, I [s]hall be happy to find you have [s]o agreeable a member added to your [s]ociety, and [s]everely blame my[s]elf for having judged [s]o har[s]hly. I [s]hould not have [s]o many fears concerning your intimacy with Matilda, had I not, [s]ome years ago, known a very amiable girl, who entirely forfeited her good name, and in the end her life, by a[s][s]ociating with a woman of light character. Harriet Harding had the misfortune to lo[s]e her mother when very young, and at a very early age took upon her[s]elf the choice of her own acquaintance. She had been at the play one night, when a lady in the [s]ame box had [s]hewn her many civilities, and at parting gave her a card, and begged to have the honour of [s]eeing her. Mr. Harding had remarked what pa[s][s]ed, and on returning home, warned his daughter again[s]t forming any acquaintance with her, as [s]he was a woman publicly kept by a man of fa[s]hion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] Harriet was giddy, thoughtle[s]s and fond of plea[s]ure; chance threw her again in the way of Amelia, and [s]he entirely forgot her father's injunction. A [s]trict intimacy en[s]ued, [s]he was frequent in her vi[s]its to Amelia, often went with her into public, and was charmed with the incen[s]e of flattery that was offered to her by the men. Mr. Harding had bu[s]ine[s]s which called him to a di[s]tant part of England, Harriet was left mi[s]tre[s]s of her own actions, and cho[s]e this opportunity to go with Amelia on an excur[s]ion in the country; in this excur[s]ion they were attended by the gentleman who kept Amelia, and one of his friends, who was particular in his attentions to Harriet; the time flew on the wings of pleasure, and when they returned to town, (Mr. Harding being [s]till ab[s]ent) it was propo[s]ed [s]he [s]hould accompany the party to a ma[s]querade. Harriet was a [s]tranger to this [s]ort of amu[s]ement, her [s]pirits were exhilerated---[s]he did not think of leaving it till a late hour, and when [s]he mentioned going home Amelia was not to be found. The gentleman who had been her protector all the evening, begged permi[s][s]ion to [s]ee her home, [s]he con[s]ented, and at the hour of five in the morning arrived at her father's hou[s]e; a [s]ervant who had aro[s]e early to perform [s]ome particular work let her in, and the gentleman followed her up [s]tairs. She was [s]urpri[s]ed, but could not be [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] rude as to tell him to leave the hou[s]e; but how was her [s]urpri[s]e increa[s]ed, when throwing a[s]ide his ma[s]k and domino, he proceeded to take liberties [s]he had ever been u[s]ed to think of with abhorrence. Unable to defend her[s]elf from his in[s]ults, [s]he [s]hrieked aloud, and in a moment her father, who had returned the evening before, bur[s]t into the room---her [s]hame and terror overcame her, and [s]he fainted; an explanation ensued between the father and the gentleman who had in[s]ulted her, who [s]hocked at the impropriety of his behaviour a[s]ked Mr. Harding's pardon, and [s]taying till Harriet was recovered, gave her this advice at parting. "I tru[s]t, my dear young lady, this will be a warning to you in future, how you choo[s]e your intimates. Amelia is a woman [s]o publicly known, that it was next to impo[s][s]ible for you not to have been acquainted with the lightne[s]s of her character, I am now fully convinced that you are a woman of [s]trict honour, but, believe me, till this day I always thought you a girl who had either no reputation to lo[s]e, or paid very little attention to [s]o material a concern. I am [s]orry to [s]ay there are numbers of per[s]ons, of both [s]exes, who have [s]een you with Amelia, who think the [s]ame, and whom it will be a very difficult matter to convince to the contrary; let me beg of you to break off a connection [s]o derogatory to your honor, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] by the future propriety of your conduct regain that reputation, which your intimacy with [s]o infamous a woman has con[s]iderably injured." Harriet could an[s]wer only with her tears, which flowed plenteou[s]ly, not only at hearing the[s]e disagreeable truths, but from the reflection, that when the [s]tranger was gone [s]he had [s]till her father's anger to endure; had this been all, Harriet might have thought her[s]elf happy, as by her future behaviour [s]he might have hoped to regain his confidence and favour, but the heedle[s]s girl too [s]oon found, that not only her father watched her actions with a [s]u[s]picious eye, but all her female friends received her vi[s]its with coldne[s]s, forbore to return them, and in a [s]hort time entirely dropped her acquaintance; to add to her mortification, a young gentleman who had for [s]ome time addre[s][s]ed her on an honourable [s]core, broke off the connection, and [s]he found her[s]elf as solitary and as much neglected as though [s]he lived in a de[s]ert." "The con[s]equence was, that on her father's decea[s]e, which happened [s]oon after, finding herself without [s]ociety, [s]he renewed her intimacy with Amelia, and from being accu[s]tomed to an intimate acquaintance with vice in others, [s]he [s]unk [s]o low as to practi[s]e it her[s]elf, without compunction or remor[s]e; till overtaken by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] disease and want (the [s]ure attendants on riot and intemperance) [s]he [s]unk to an early grave, a victim to her own folly." You [s]ee, my dear girls, Harriet was not naturally of a depraved inclination, [s]he [s]hrunk with horror from the fir[s]t approach of vice; her attachment to Amelia was founded on a love of pleasure, [s]he enjoyed every luxury while with her, led a life of indolence, and was continually receiving pre[s]ents of [s]omething to decorate her person; the[s]e were indulgences [s]he could not enjoy at home, for though Mr. Harding was a very [s]ub[s]tantial trade[s]man, he would by no means allow his daughter to launch into extravagance, either in her hou[s]ekeeping, dre[s]s, or plea[s]ure---he wi[s]hed to [s]ee every hour u[s]efully employed, and as youth in general are much more fond of pleasure than employment, Harriet was delighted with the acquaintance of a woman in who[s]e society [s]he could enjoy the one in its utmo[s]t extent, without ever hearing of the other. I know my dear girls will tell me, there is no danger of Matilda drawing them into any improper [s]cenes, by gratifying their de[s]ire of dissipation, [s]ince their father indulgently allows them to enjoy every plea[s]urable amu[s]ement the metropolis affords. But you are totally unacquainted with the world, there are a thou[s]and ways by which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] an artful woman may [s]teal upon the unde[s]igning heart, a thou[s]and ways by which [s]he may lead them to de[s]truction. Be wife then, my [s]weet young friends, and drop this acquaintance, before you feel any of its di[s]agreeable con[s]equences. I [s]hall in [s]ome future letter give you a few hints concerning the proper u[s]e of time, certain that however har[s]h you may for a moment think my reproofs, the native goodne[s]s of your hearts, will convince you they are meant [s]olely for your good, and that you have not a more affectionate friend than MENTORIA. MENTORIA TO MISS WINWORTHS. My Dear Girls, In my la[s]t I gave you a [s]triking in[s]tance of the dangerous tendency of improper acquaintance; be a[s][s]ured, there are more women led into errors by the bad precepts and examples of their own [s]ex, than you would be apt to imagine, not only in for[s]eiting their good name, but every pretension to happine[s]s. I do not know how otherwi[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] to account for [s]o many lovely, amiable women entailing mi[s]ery upon them[s]elves and their posterity, than by the romantic ideas they entertain of love and friend[s]hip. Love, my dear children, is a noble, generous pa[s][s]ion, and when kept under the guidance of reason, exalts and elevates the human [s]oul; but the juvenile mind is apt to mi[s]take a tran[s]ient likeing, or a [s]udden impul[s]e of gratified vanity, for love; and many a girl from at fir[s]t being plea[s]ed with the company of tho[s]e who indi[s]criminately offer the incen[s]e of adulation to every young female begins to fancy one more particular than the re[s]t, and that one is undoubtedly de[s]igned to be her hu[s]band. From the moment this idea takes place, Mi[s]s is mo[s]t violently in love, [s]leeping or waking the dear youth is continnally in her thoughts, [s]he lives but in his pre[s]ence, when he is ab[s]ent [s]he only exi[s]ts. She unbo[s]oms her[s]elf to [s]ome dear girl nearly of her own age, and [s]he being her friend and confidant, the [s]ecret is to be kept inviolable. For want of [s]ome laudable pur[s]uit to employ her time and engage her attention, [s]he indulges her fooli[s]h penchant , which originated fir[s]t in vanity and was afterwards nur[s]ed by fancy, till at length [s]he is in reality attached to a man, who perhaps never entertained a [s]erious thought of her; he marries [s]ome other woman, and Mi[s]s is left to [s]igh at her hard fate, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] complain of the perfidy of mankind, and indulge in a luxury of delicate ideal mi[s]ery. Nor is this all, her dear and faithful friend betrays her secret to all the Mi[s][s]es of her acquaintance, who (though perhaps guilty of the [s]ame foliy themselves) will not [s]cruple to laugh at what they will term, her indi[s]creet and fooli[s]h conduct. Though [s]uch a [s]ituation is certainly [s]ufficiently mortifying, yet it is by no means the wor[s]t that may happen. A girl who imagines [s]he mu[s]t be in love with the fir[s]t man who [s]ays a few civil things to her, lays her[s]elf open to the de[s]igns of the object of her ideal pa[s][s]ion, who if he [s]hould happen to be an artful man, may take advantage of her partiality and credulity, to draw her into indi[s][s]oluble engagements, which is in general the ca[s]e when there is a fortune in the way, or where that charm is wanting, to plunge her into infamy. I once knew a girl, who, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of every advantage which could be derived from wealth, beauty, honorable relations, and a polite liberal education, at the early age of eighteen fell a victim to a romantic pa[s][s]ion, and in the very moment when [s]he [s]acrificed the regard of her friends, the hopes of future advancement in life, in [s]hort, every thing that was valuable, [s]he fancied [s]he had done a prai[s]e-worthy action, by evincing her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] con[s]tancy and di[s]intere[s]ted attachment to the object of her fir[s]t love. Belinda Dormer went to the [s]ame [s]chool with me, we contracted a great friend[s]hip for each other, and when the holidays [s]eparated us, by calling each to her re[s]pective home, we treasured up every little incident in our memories, whether of pain or plea[s]ure, that when we met we might exchange confidence, and live over our plea[s]ures, or [s]oothe the remembrance of our little unea[s]ine[s][s]es by participation. Bell was a lovely brown girl, elegant in her form, accompli[s]hed in her manners, and lively in her di[s]po[s]ition; her heart was tender and affectionate, without the lea[s]t tincture of art or affectation, good-natured, ea[s]y, and credulous. She left [s]chool at the age of [s]eventeen, and was u[s]hered into the world, prepared to admire her, for [s]he was reputed heire[s]s to an immen[s]e fortune. The Chri[s]tmas before [s]he was taken home, during the holidays, her father gave a ball in honor of her birth-day, a young officer, who[s]e only recommendation was an hand[s]ome per[s]on and polite addre[s]s, and who depended on Mr. Dormer for farther advancement in the army, reque[s]ted the honor of her hand, and in the cour[s]e of the evening danced him[s]elf [s]o far into her e[s]teem, that [s]he implicitly believed him, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] when he told her [s]he was the lovelie[s]t creature in the world, and that he [s]hould be mi[s]erable if [s]he did not [s]uffer him to hope he was not altogether indifferent to her. Mr. Dormer had placed great confidence in this young man, he had taken him from a [s]tate of abject penury, placed him at a genteel academy, and when he imagined him capable of discharging his duty, as became a man of honor and a [s]oldier, purcha[s]ed him an en[s]ign's commi[s][s]ion in a regiment going to America, where he rai[s]ed him[s]elf to the rank of captain, and was now ju[s]t returned to England. Mr. Dormer ever intended to be the friend and patron of young Horton, but never dreamt of his a[s]piring to his daughter, he therefore gave him a general invitation to his hou[s]e, nor once thought but that his gratitude and honor would be [s]ufficient to prevent his forming any improper de[s]igns on the per[s]on or fortune of Belinda, be[s]ides he was near ten years older than Mi[s]s Dormer, and therefore there was no fear of an attachment taking place between them. But Horton was an artful ambitious man, he long had wi[s]hed to enjoy the benefits of an independent fortune, and looked on Belinda as the per[s]on by who[s]e a[s][s]i[s]tance he could obtain [s]o de[s]irable an acqui[s]ition. He had always been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] [s]ucce[s]sful with the ladies, but the true [s]tate of his finances being generally known, he found it impo[s][s]ible to [s]ucceed in any matrimonial [s]cheme, except it was with the innocent and un[s]u[s]picious, and Belinda was exactly [s]uited for his purpo[s]e. He flattered, [s]wore, knelt, wept, and acted every extravagance, till the [s]imple girl made [s]ome confe[s][s]ions in his favor, he then prevailed on her to keep her partiality a [s]ecret from her mother, for he knew that her parents de[s]igned her for the bride of a young nobleman, who was at at that time abroad. He expatiated on the folly and cruelty of parents choo[s]ing partners for their children, and launched out in prai[s]e of disinterested love, talked of the union of [s]ouls, and a deal of [s]oft [s]entimental non[s]en[s]e, about a life of uninterruped felicity with the object of her own choice, though [s]he was to live in the meane[s]t cottage. When Belinda returned to [s]chool, [s]he fancied her[s]elf as much in love as it was po[s][s]ible for any [s]entimental heroine to be, and declared, for her [s]weet Horton [s]he would be content to relinqui[s]h all the elegancies and indulgencies to which [s]he had ever been accu[s]tomed, and live upon the coar[s]e[s]t viands, in an ob[s]cure man[s]ion. It was in vain I endeavoured to argue my young friend out of the[s]e ridiculous notions, [s]he remained [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] fixed in her determination, to marry Horton or not marry at all. Unfortunately for Belinda, at that time I had as chimerical ideas of friend[s]hip as [s]he had of love, and [s]hould have [s]uppo[s]ed it an inexcusable breach of confidence, to di[s]cover her designs to her mother, though it would have been the be[s]t proof of real friend[s]hip I could possibly have given her. She was taken from [s]chool with a de[s]ign of being introduced to Lord Gaymore; [s]he went home one day, had a meeting with Horton the next, and the third morning by five o'clock [s]et off in a chai[s]e and four to Scotland, without having even [s]een the per[s]on her parents [s]o earne[s]tly wi[s]hed her to be united with. When they returned, Mr. Dormer, though highly offended at the ra[s]h conduct of Belinda, and the black ingratitude of Horton, forgave them, and [s]ettled an hand[s]ome annuity on her, but told them the bulk of his fortune was entailed on Lord Gaymore, (who was the neare[s]t male relation) in ca[s]e of her refu[s]al of him. Belinda was [s]oon [s]ettled, and I took an early opportunity to vi[s]it her; I found her, according to her own words, [s]uperlatively happy! her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] Horton was the kinde[s]t be[s]t of hu[s]bands, her home was a paradi[s]e, [s]he would not be Lady Gaymore for the world! What was affluence? Nothing when put in competition with love and Horton." But this was the language of romance. I called on her again in about [s]ix months. I found her [s]itting in extreme di[s]habille, her face was pale, her eyes [s]unk, and as [s]he pen[s]ively leaned her head upon her hand, a tear now and then [s]tole down her cheek. I a[s]ked tenderly the cau[s]e of her [s]orrow. "Oh! my friend," [s]aid [s]he, "I have undone my[s]elf! Horton is no longer the attentive tender hu[s]band." I, [s]miling, told her, that [s]he mu[s]t not expect the [s]olicitude of the lover to la[s]t for life, but be content with the more calm and la[s]ting e[s]teem of a friend. "Alas!" replied Belinda, "I have no friend, I find, too late, my violent attachment to Horton was the romantic whim of a lively imagination; and that the union of [s]ouls, the [s]imilarity of [s]entiment, which I had vainly thought would make the [s]etters of Hymen ea[s]y, and even delightful, exi[s]ted only in my ideas. Horton has neither [s]en[s]e, good nature, or politene[s]s at home, though he appears to po[s][s]e[s]s tho[s]e amiable qualities [s]o eminently abroad. He is extravagant, vain, and too [s]ond of his own per[s]on, to be long [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] attached to any woman, except his pa[s][s]ion is excited by intere[s]ted motives; he has not scrupled to own, it was the hope of po[s][s]e[s][s]ing my fortune alone induced him to addre[s]s me, and that had he known the e[s]tate was entailed on Lord Gaymore, he never would have troubled him[s]elf to make love to a puny, baby-faced girl, when there were [s]o many fine women who would have thought them[s]elves honoured by his notice. Indeed, continued [s]he, redoubling her tears, he [s]eldom comes home but I am in[s]ulted with a recital of the many women of fa[s]hion who make him advances, and I am debarred of every innocent amu[s]ement, [s]tinted in my dre[s]s, and almo[s]t kept without pocket-money, that he may appear with elegance in company, and have plenty of money to lavi[s]h in expen[s]ive plea[s]ures. I was greatly chagrined to find my dear young friend had really [s]uch ju[s]t cau[s]e for complaint, but endeavoured to comfort her, and lead her to hope, that by con[s]tant affection, attention, and good-humour, [s]he might recal her wanderer, and awaken in his bo[s]om reciprocal tenderne[s]s. But I found by her reply, the[s]e were fallacious hopes. She had been to vi[s]it her parents, and had there formed an acquaintance with Lord Gaymore. Unfortunately the ill-fated Belinda [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] discovered this once dreaded nobleman to be possessed of every real virtue, of which Horton had a[s][s]umed the [s]emblance; his per[s]on was handsome, without being effeminate, his heart glowed with humanity and benevolence; he was a man of refined [s]en[s]e and [s]trict honor, with a mind enlightened and expanded by a liberal education and a thorough knowledge of the world. Belinda [s]aw him, and acknowledged the full value of the happine[s]s [s]he had voluntarily ca[s]t from her. I warned her again[s]t making compari[s]ons to the di[s]paragement of her hu[s]band; and hinted the folly and danger of [s]uffering any other person to [s]tand higher in her e[s]teem. She acknowledged the truth of my remarks, [s]aid [s]he would endeavour to be patient and content, but [s]he greatly feared [s]he had lo[s]t [s]ight of happine[s]s for ever. And [s]o indeed it proved, for though at the death of her father [s]he received a very hand[s]ome legacy, [s]o great was Horton's extravagance that it was pre[s]ently gone, lavi[s]hed away on the wor[s]t of women for the mo[s]t infamous purpo[s]es. Belinda had children very fa[s]t, and before [s]he was thirty years old was left a widow with eight helple[s]s children, to [s]truggle with the accumulated evils of poverty, contempt, and a broken heart--- Horton's extravagance having obliged her to [s]ell her annuity, [s]he had no re[s]ource but to accept a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] [s]mall yearly allowance from Lord Gaymore, who was then married, and allowed her a hundred pounds a year, for the education of her elde[s]t boy, to whom he was god-father. I will leave you my dear girls to imagine the pain and mortification of [s]uch a dependence, and while you pity Belinda's misfortune, cautiou[s]ly avoid her errors! I [s]hall renew the [s]ubject next po[s]t, till when and ever believe me your friend, MENTORIA. As my [s]ubject is love, my dear children may perhaps for once think an old woman entertaining; but when they find my intention is only to expo[s]e the dangers which are attendant on that pa[s][s]ion, in[s]tead of following the example of more juvenile [s]cribblers, by expatiating on its pleasures, you will throw down my letter in a pet. But I [s]hall not let this deter me from following my intended plan, and endeavouring to convince you that there cannot be a more critical period in the whole cour[s]e of your lives, than that in which you are [s]urrounded by lovers; nor can there be any thing of more dangerous tendency than a young woman [s]uffering a lover to approach her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] in a clande[s]tine manner, or encourage addre[s][s]es which [s]he has any rea[s]on to think her parents or friends would di[s]approve; [s]uch a conduct is generally attended with di[s]agreeable con[s]equences. I have a collection of letters in my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, which I think might well be termed a [s]chool for lovers, and will, I am certain, be of more effect in convincing you of the impropriety of clandestine marriages, than a whole [s]heet of dull precepts. I have [s]ent them for your peru[s]al, and by way of preface, [s]hall give you an account of the means by which I became po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of them. A favourite [s]ervant of your grand-mother's who had been my nur[s]e, had married a reputable trade[s]man, but, through unavoidable misfortunes, they were reduced, and the hu[s]band thrown into pri[s]on. Martha lived in an ob[s]cure lodging, and had been for [s]ome months extremely ill. My lady encouraged me in going to [s]ee her, and carrying her little pre[s]ents. One day my lady was gone out to dinner, the [s]ervants were all in the kitchen, and I took that opportunity of going out unob[s]erved to vi[s]it Martha. Charmed with the idea of going by my[s]elf (for I u[s]ually had a [s]ervant with me) I tripped nimbly along, in my way laying out my whole [s]tock of pocket money, which amounted to five [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] [s]hillings, in tea, [s]ugar and bi[s]cuits, for my nur[s]e. As I went up [s]tairs to Martha's apartment, I observed in a [s]mall back room, the door of which was taken off the hinges, a tall well-made man, in an old ru[s]ty black coat, his face pale and meagre, his arms folded upon his bo[s]om, his eyes fixed [s]eemingly on the floor, but in[s]tead of the vacant inanimate [s]tare, there was a mixture of horror and de[s]pair depicted in them. Curio[s]ity prompted me to draw near the door of the room; at the farther end, on a bundle of [s]traw, the only furniture the wretched apartment afforded, [s]at a woman, who[s]e features told [s]he had once been lovely; on her lap lay an infant a[s]leep, be[s]ide her [s]at a fine boy, who, with a piteous accent was a[s]king for bread; the woman paid no attention to his entreaties, but with her eyes fixed on the younge[s]t child, appeared like mi[s]ery per[s]onified. Young as I was, I felt my heart greatly afflicted at this [s]cene, and running ha[s]tily up [s]tairs into Martha's room, unable to articulate a word, I bur[s]t into tears. Martha a[s]toni[s]hed at the agony I was in, tenderly inquired the cau[s]e. I told her what I had [s]een. "Alas! my dear child," [s]aid [s]he, "tho[s]e people are in more di[s]tre[s]s than it is po[s][s]ible for you to conceive; they have lodged in this hou[s]e about [s]ix weeks, in which time I am certain they have had nothing to [s]upport themselves and children but what they could rai[s]e from the [s]ale of a few cloaths; they are now a fortnight [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] in arrears for rent, and the inhuman landlord has taken the door off the hinges, and the windows out of the frames, to oblige them to quit the apartment. Alas, poor [s]ouls, they have no means of procuring another [s]helter from nocturnal dews, when they relingui[s]h this. I have not [s]een him [s]tir out the[s]e two days pa[s]t, and am apt to think in that time they have had no food except a [s]lice of bread and meat which I gave the elde[s]t child ye[s]terday. How at that moment did I regret my money being all [s]pent, five [s]hillings appeared to me a fortune, which might pre[s]erve the[s]e unfortunate people; however, I had not even a [s]ingle halfpenny, nor could I bear the thought of taking from Martha any part of what I had given her. I therefore ha[s]tily bade her good bye, and flew rather than walked home, inquired for the hou[s]e-keeper, related the afflicting [s]ituation of the family, and reque[s]ted the loan of half a guinea. The house-keeper was an unfeeling, mercenary woman, [s]he never heard a tale of di[s]tre[s]s but [s]he imagined it fictitious, nor would [s]he ever be[s]tow any relief, left the object relieved [s]hould be an impo[s]tor. She refu[s]ed my reque[s]t. I then had recour[s]e to the nur[s]ery maid, but could borrow no more than one [s]hilling. With this trifle I eagerly returned to the poor [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] [s]ufferers, entered the apartment, and under pretence of ki[s][s]ing the infant, dropped the [s]hilling into the mother's lap. The exclamation which broke from her, when [s]he [s]aw the money, convinced me [s]he was a foreigner; and the demeanour of the man was va[s]tly above the common rank of people. Unfortunately my Lady did not return from her vi[s]it till after [s]upper, [s]o that I was not permitted to [s]et up to [s]ee her; but though I retired to bed I could not [s]leep, my mind had been too much agitated, and the [s]tarving family had left [s]uch an impre[s][s]ion on it, that the moment I clo[s]ed my eyes they were pre[s]ent to my imagination. Early in the morning I [s]tole to Lady Winworth's chamber, told my little [s]tory, and on my knees intreated [s]ome money to carry to them. Her Lady[s]hip, though from infancy nur[s]ed in the lap of ca[s]e and affluence, had an heart overflowing with compa[s][s]ion towards her [s]uffering fellow-creatures; [s]he gave me two guineas, and ordered the footman immediately to attend me. I cannot de[s]cribe the joy that expanded my heart as I proceeded to G---Street. The ma[s]ter of the hou[s]e was ju[s]t ri[s]en, and was opening his [s]hop. I a[s]ked for the foreign gentleman. Gentleman , returned he with a [s]neer, the French [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] beggar I [s]uppo[s]e you mean, I don't know where he is, I turned them out la[s]t night; people who cannot afford to pay for their lodgings, mu[s]t lay where and how they can. Cruel inhuman wretch, [s]aid I, and turned from him with every mark of abhorrence. It was yet early, the morning was inviting, and I thought a walk in the fields might cheer me after my recent di[s]appointment; however, I previou[s]ly determined every inquiry [s]hould be made after the poor foreigner and his family. Cro[s][s]ing a field in the vicinity of Mary-lebon, the voice of a child crying caught my ear, I turned my head, and [s]aw at a little di[s]tance, [s]eated on a log of wood, the very per[s]on I had been [s]eeking, one child was in his arms, the other [s]tood by him, his wife lay on the ground. I ran to him, [s]poke to him, bade him take hope, and put the two guineas in his hand---he looked at the money, then at me. Angel of mercy, [s]aid he, with a deep [s]igh, it is too late, my Agnes has left me. I [s]aw his intellects were di[s]ordered and [s]huddered with horror. Thinking the wife would be better able to take care of the money, I [s]tooped in order to awaken her---I called her, [s]he moved not---I took hold of her hand, it was dreadfully cold; [s]he is in a fit, [s]aid I, and rai[s]ed her head upon my knee. Never, oh! never, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] my beloved girls, will the [s]pectacle that pre[s]ented it[s]elf to my eyes, be bani[s]hed from my memory. Her eyes were partly clo[s]ed, her mouth half open, her lips black---Death had that night released her from a world of mi[s]ery. I [s]hrieked and fainted. When I recovered I found my[s]elf in my dear Lady's arms, who told me, the body of the poor young woman was taken care of, that the man was quite di[s]tracted and entirely unable to give any account of him[s]elf, though from an unfini[s]hed letter, addre[s][s]ed to the Marchione[s]s Savillion, which was found in the woman's pocket they had rea[s]on to [s]uppo[s]e they were of a good family. The man [s]urvived his wife but a few days, my Lady took care of the children. About [s]ix months after I was [s]ent to a convent near Paris, in order to fini[s]h my education, and perfect my[s]elf in the French language. Among a number of boarders who re[s]ided at the convent, I was particularly noticed by one, who was distinguished by the title of St. Augu[s]tina; [s]he was of a weakly con[s]titution, and often confined to her bed, when [s]he was always plea[s]ed if I would work or read be[s]ide her. One day [s]he gave me her keys, and de[s]ired me to unlock a cabinet and take out a curious piece of needle- work which [s]he [s]aid had been executed by a once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] loved friend. As I took the work from the drawer, a miniature picture attracted my notice; methought I knew the features; I took it up to examine it more minutely, and immediately recollected the intere[s]ting countenance of the unfortunate Agnes. Upon inquiry I found I was right in my conjecture; St. Augu[s]tina was the Marchione[s]s Savillion, whom Lady Winworth had made numerous fruitle[s]s inquiries after. She had been the friend and companion of Agnes, but had married and left the convent where they both boarded ju[s]t before that young lady, and her la[s]t pathetic letters never reached her till it was too late to admini[s]ter relief; the Marchioness had [s]ince lo[s]t her hu[s]band and two fine children, by fire, which accident had [s]o impaired her health and depre[s][s]ed her [s]pirits, that [s]he had retired from the world, and meant to [s]pend the remainder of her days in the convent where [s]he had pa[s][s]ed her youth. She [s]hewed me all Agnes's letters, and before I left France [s]uffered me to take copies of them. AGNES TO THE MARCHIONESS. ` Why have you left me, my Augu[s]tina, why are you away at the moment I mo[s]t want your advice?---Selfi[s]h Agnes, methinks I hear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] you [s]ay, to regret the happine[s]s of your friend, becau[s]e it interferes with your own. Oh! no, I do not regret your felicity, my [s]weet friend, I rejoice, I exult in the reflection that you are for ever exempt from the pangs which at pre[s]ent rive the heart of the wretched Agnes. You ever knew the aver[s]ion and horror that [s]eized my heart when I reflected on the intended union between my[s]elf and the Count de la Rue. Alas! my Augu[s]tina, the time approaches when that aver[s]ion will become a crime, and yet I feel it every day increa[s]e. Shall I own to the [s]ympathizing bo[s]om of friend[s]hip, that my heart has made its election, and that election has not fallen on the man for whom my parents have designed me. I know you will blame me, I know you will bid me endeavour to conquer my growing pa[s][s]ion, and call in rea[s]on to my a[s][s]i[s]tance. Alas! what power has rea[s]on over the heart torn by contending pa[s][s]ions? Duty bids me [s]tifle my [s]ighs, and bend my thoughts and wi[s]hes towards the Count, love triumphs over duty, and I can only think of Vieurville. The day after you left our convent, Madamoiselle Vieurville reque[s]ted me to attend her to the parlour, where her brother and lover waited to [s]ee her. "You mu[s]t go, Agnes, [s]aid [s]he, or my brother will be quite at a lo[s]s how to amu[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] him[s]elf, while I conver[s]e with Montro[s]e." I was ea[s]ily per[s]uaded, and on entering the parlour, was [s]truck with the noble mein and elegant manner of young Vieurville; we chatted for [s]ome time on indifferent [s]ubjects, his vivacity and wit, (through which it was ea[s]y to di[s]cover a fund of good [s]en[s]e) delighted me, and when I retired with Mademoi[s]elle, I could not help expre[s][s]ing my admiration; he is a charming young man indeed, [s]aid [s]he, and had I not known that you were on the point of marriage, I [s]hould not have ventured to introduce him to you, for fear you might lo[s]e your heart; for you mu[s]t know (continued [s]he, paying no regard to the vi[s]ible emotion which I am certain agitated my features) that Louis is to be married the [s]ame day that I am, to a beautiful Spani[s]h lady, who is expected in Paris next month. Has he ever [s]een his intended bride [s]aid I, affecting indifference. Oh! no, [s]he replied, but if Donna Clara be but half as lovely as her picture repre[s]ents her, he mu[s]t inevitably fall in love. It is odd, [s]aid I, that he [s]hould con[s]ent to marry a woman he has never [s]een. I dare [s]ay it appears [s]o to you, replied Mademoi[s]elle, but when I [s]hall tell you how it came about, your wonder will cea[s]e. My mother was the only daughter of an ancient wealthy Spani[s]h family, and eloped with my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] father from a convent, where [s]he was placed for education. The match was very unequal; her father was irreconcilably offended, and would never [s]uffer her to be named in his pre[s]ence. My mother was tenderly beloved by her brother, who, at the old nobleman's decea[s]e, paid her a hand[s]ome fortune, and vowed their families [s]hould ever live in the [s]tricte[s]t amity. My uncle was married to a woman of whom he was pa[s][s]ionately fond, and when, in giving birth to Donna Clara, [s]he departed this world, he took a [s]olemn oath that no other woman [s]hould ever [s]upply her place, but that the whole of his future life [s]hould be devoted to the care of his daughter. My mother at that time lying in of a [s]on, the two infants were contracted to each other, and my brother, at his uncle's decea[s]e, is to inherit the e[s]tate and titles devolving to him from his grandfather. My uncle is expected to bring his daughter to Paris this winter, when the marriage is to be completed, and I [s]hall be delivered from this horrid convent. I cannot de[s]cribe my feelings during Mademoiselle's recital. I know not what could be the cau[s]e of my agitation, but I could hardly re[s]train my tears, while I remained in her apartment. When I retired, I began to take my heart to talk, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] and determined to repel a ri[s]ing pa[s][s]ion, which had thus [s]uddenly taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of it. I forebore making any compari[s]on between my intended Lord and young Vieurville, and determined never to [s]ee the latter again; but the next morning vanqui[s]hed the[s]e good re[s]olutions. I was but ju[s]t ari[s]en, when one of the lay-[s]i[s]ters informed me a gentleman reque[s]ted a few moments conver[s]ation. Imagining it to be either the Count, or [s]ome me[s][s]enger from my father, I repaired without he[s]itation to the parlour. Judge of my [s]urpri[s]e when I found my[s]elf in the pre[s]ence of Mon[s]ieur Vieurville. Suppo[s]ing the nun had made a mi[s]take in calling me in[s]tead of Mademoiselle, his [s]i[s]ter, I was going to retire, when he intreated me to [s]top, a[s][s]ured me there was no mi[s]take, and taking my hand, led me to a chair, and [s]eated him[s]elf be[s]ide me. I come, deare[s]t Madam, [s]aid he, to entreat a few moments [s]erious attention from you, and a candid an[s]wer to a que[s]tion, which though abrupt in its nature, yet from the circum[s]tances which we both at pre[s]ent are in, demands an explicit reply. My [s]i[s]ter has informed me, that your parents de[s]ign you for the wife of Count de la Rue; however pre[s]umptuous the [s]uppo[s]ition may be, I cannot imagine your heart has any interest in the intended union. My heart, Sir, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] replied I, will ever follow the dictates of duty, and rejoice in ratifying any engagement which I am certain will give my parents [s]o much pleasure. But was that heart left to make its free choice, would it then have [s]elected the Count as the object of its deare[s]t affection? I know not, Mon[s]ieur, what authority you have to make the[s]e enquiries, nor do I think my[s]elf obliged to an[s]wer them. I ro[s]e to quit the parlour---lovely Agnes, [s]aid he, catching my hand, I know I have been abrupt, but let my [s]ituation plead my excu[s]e. You no doubt have heard from my [s]i[s]ter, that I am de[s]igned the hu[s]band of a woman I have never [s]een; till ye[s]terday I ever believed my heart unsusceptible of the power of beauty, and imagined I might be as happy with Donna Clara as any other woman, but I am now convinced, that indifference only proceeded from the want of a proper object to call forth the affections of my heart. I have [s]een the lovely object who has that power, I feel my bo[s]om glow with new and unutterable sensations, and though I would have married Clara had I continued in a [s]tate of indifference; I will never wed her now, my heart is firmly attached to another. You, adorable Agnes, are the only [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] woman who ever gave my heart a [s]ingle pain, or taught it to throb with rapture; if your affections are already engaged, I will condemn my[s]elf to eternal [s]ilence, but if you will grant me one ray of hope that you are not altogether indifferent to my [s]uit, the world [s]hall not tempt me to enter into any engagement with Donna Clara. Oh! my beloved Augu[s]tina, at that moment rea[s]on, honour, fortitude, for[s]ook me, enchanted with the convincing proof he offered to give me of inviolable attachment, I [s]uffered him to perceive my partiality. I thought not on the irreparable injury I [s]hould do Vieurville's family, I forgot the duty I owed my parents, the re[s]pect I owed my[s]elf, and confe[s][s]ed that he alone was the ma[s]ter of my affections. I [s]ee your anger, my dear friend, I hear you blame my imprudence; [s]hall I lo[s]e your friendship, Augu[s]tina, will you cha[s]e the imprudent Agnes from your bo[s]om! Alas! If you do, where will [s]he find another re[s]ting place? The thought overpowers me, I can write no more. Adieu, AGNES. From the same to the same. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] I acknowledge your reproof, I [s]ee my error, but I have not power to renounce it. You bid me exert my fortitude; I have no fortitude, my friend, it all for[s]ook me when I was parted from Augu[s]tina, what little I ever po[s][s]e[s][s]ed was but a gentle [s]park of virtue caught from her bo[s]om. I am nothing of my[s]elf, a [s]eather, an atom of thi[s]tledown is heavy when weighed against the [s]tability of Agnes. Donna Clara is arrived, and Vieurville has refu[s]ed to fulfil the engagements his father had entered into; his [s]i[s]ter [s]u[s]pects the cau[s]e, I have lo[s]t her friend[s]hip, I have endured her reproaches; yes, my friend Agnes de Romani has [s]ubjected her[s]elf to reproach, and con[s]cious that [s]he de[s]erved it, received it in pa[s][s]ive [s]ilence, nor dared to vent her full heart in aught but tears. Oh! Augustina, how am I fallen! I have this morning received a [s]ummons to return home; to-morrow I leave the convent, to-morrow I bid adieu to Vieurville. I am expected to receive the hand of the Count---'tis a vain hope, I am determined to refu[s]e him---I cannot be the wife of Vieurville, I will never be the wife of another--- my grave would be a welcomer bridal bed, than [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] to [s]hare a diadem with De la Rue. Augu[s]tina, pity me, but do not hate me. AGNES. I have refu[s]ed him. I have borne a father's anger, a mother's tears, but [s]till continue re[s]olute. Alas! Augu[s]tina, how ea[s]y is it to a[s][s]ume courage and fortitude when the heart is intere[s]ted. Methinks for Vieurville I could bear, without complaining, the heavie[s]t ills to which human nature is [s]ubject. My father has ju[s]t left me, he has offered the Count my younger [s]i[s]ter Theodora, he has accepted her, and I am to take the veil, and give up my fortune in return for this condescension, I have con[s]ented with alacrity. Oh Vieurville, what a [s]acrifice I make for you. To-morrow I return to the convent, and enter on my novitiate. Augu[s]tina, pity me, pray for me, and, if you can forget her errors, [s]till love your AGNES. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] Eight months of my novitiate is pa[s]t, and I have never heard of Vieurville. But what is Vieurville to me? Am I not going to renounce the world and all its plea[s]ures; am I not going to devote my future life to my maker? Augu[s]tina, are not my thoughts free, and though my body is immured within the walls of a cloi[s]ter, may not my fancy wander, free as air, to Vieurville. Oh! the tortures of [s]u[s]pence! Could I but know where he was, could I but be [s]atisfied he [s]till remembers Agnes, methinks I could be content. Write to me, my friend, endeavour to calm my mind; tell me, Augu[s]tina, when I have thrown off the trappings which mark a child of vanity, will not [s]weet peace inhabit my bo[s]om, when [s]implicity has attired my per[s]on? And when the irrevocable vow has pa[s]t my lips, will not my perturbed [s]pirits be hu[s]hed to re[s]t, and all my [s]oul be rapt in religious harmony. Oh! no, no, my [s]weet friend, the ma[s][s]y doors that clo[s]e on us poor captives, cannot [s]hut out the bu[s]y meddling pa[s][s]ions, or [s]tifle the feelings we receive from nature. The [s]implicity of our habit is not an index of the purity of our mind, nor is the kneeling po[s]ture, or lifted eye, true indications of the fervor of religion! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] Augustina, hypocri[s]y may dwell in a convent, [s]o may love, hatred, jealou[s]y, and de[s]pair. And is an heart agitated by the[s]e contending pa[s][s]ions, a [s]it [s]acrifice to be offered at the throne of grace? Will not your Agnes be the wor[s]t of hypocrites, to vow eternal love and faith to her Maker, when her whole [s]oul is ab[s]orbed in a pa[s][s]ion for a frail mortal! I know I di[s]tre[s]s you, my friend, Oh! pardon the wretched Agnes, if with her complaining [s]he [s]ometimes da[s]hes with bitter the cup which overflows with ble[s][s]ings; if you refu[s]e to hear my complaints, where [s]hall the unhappy Agnes [s]eek for compa[s][s]ion---had[s]t thou never left me I [s]hould not have been the wretch I am. Adieu. May every ble[s][s]ing heaven can bestow, or you de[s]ire, be your portion, prays the lo[s]t AGNES. Augustina , you will tremble when you receive this, you will think it a meritorious act to drive from your heart the remembrance of Agnes de Romani; but if thou ha[s]t any remaining gleam of compa[s][s]ion in thy gentle bo[s]om, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] oh give it way, renounce not thy unhappy friend, but chear her with one forgiving line. I have [s]een Vieurville, I have forfeited my vows, left the convent, and become a fugitive and an exile, my brain is diftracted when I think what I have [s]uffered this la[s]t fourteen days, nor can all my hu[s]band's tenderne[s]s [s]oothe me. My pul[s]e throbs, my veins are [s]corched with heat--- I mu[s]t throw a[s]ide my pen, my eyes are dim. Augu[s]tina, thy dying friend lifts up her [s]oul in prayers for thy happine[s]s. After three weeks being confined to my bed, I am at length permitted to addre[s]s the compassionate friend of my youth. Rai[s]ed from the confines of the grave, I once more pour forth my [s]oul into the bo[s]om of Augu[s]tina. I will now attempt to give you [s]ome regular account of the proceedings of la[s]t month. Alas! my friend, my heart will bleed afre[s]h as I trace the painful [s]cenes, painful they will ever be to my remembrance, for I have drawn inevitable ruin on the man my [s]oul doated on. As I had never heard any tidings of Vieurville, from the time I was taken from the convent, with a de[s]ign of being married to the Count, till within three days of the time when my novitiate was expired, I began to look on my profe[s][s]ion as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] inevitable, and endeavoured to bring my[s]elf to think of it with calmne[s]s, but [s]till corroding thoughts would [s]ometimes intrude, and overturn my be[s]t re[s]olutions. My only wi[s]h was to hear whether Vieurville was alive or dead, or whether he was married to my rival; but the[s]e were particulars I was never able to di[s]cover, as his father and family had quitted Paris [s]oon after my return to the convent. There remained but three days now before I was to take the veil, and I endeavoured to forfity my mind again[s]t the awful day, with every argument rea[s]on or religion could [s]upply. I was bu[s]y in reflecting on the change a few [s]hort hours would make, when one of our boarders a[s]ked me to accompany her to the grate; I complied, and we amu[s]ed our[s]elves [s]ometime in chatting to two Engli[s]h ladies, who were in the parlour; the ladies were ju[s]t preparing to leave the convent, when a violent ringing at the gate alarmed us; the portre[s]s ran to open it, and in a moment Vieurville ru[s]hed into the parlour. I know not what I [s]aid or whether I [s]poke at all---a [s]udden mi[s]t ob[s]cured my [s]ight and I fell to the ground; when I recovered, my friend, the boarder, told me, that [s]eeing the impetuo[s]ity of my lover, [s]he had advi[s]ed him to leave the convent, and if he had any thing particular to communicate, to do it by letter, and inclo[s]e it to her. Her friendly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] [s]oothing greatly contributed to calm my [s]pirits, and as none of the [s]i[s]terhood had [s]een Vieurville, they all remained ignorant of the interview. In about three hours I received a letter, in which he told me, nothing but ab[s]olute force [s]hould [s]o long have kept him from me; that he had been detained in Spain by various [s]tratagems, but having at la[s]t eluded the vigilance of his guards, he hurried to Paris, where he pre[s]ently learnt the [s]acrifice I was about to make, he urged my leaving the convent and being united to him by the mo[s]t indi[s][s]oluble bonds; and [s]aid, he made no doubt but my father would be ea[s]ily led to forgive us. I [s]hewed the letter to my young friend, [s]he joined the per[s]ua[s]ions of Vieruville, and [s]aid [s]he would undertake to manage my e[s]cape on the very morning on which I was to become profe[s]t. I wrote to my dear Vieurville, and my friend enclo[s]ed it in one from her[s]elf, directing him in what manner to proceed. That very evening Edella, (which was the name of my friend) was [s]eized with a violent indi[s]po[s]ition, which would have made a dupe of even me, had I not been in the [s]ecret. She continued ill all night, and the next day when [s]he de[s]ired the abbe[s]s to [s]end to a relation [s]he had about [s]even miles from Paris, requesting [s]he would [s]end her coach for her the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] en[s]uing morning at eleven o'clock, as [s]he thought a few days [s]pent in the country, would be of infinite [s]ervice to her. Vieurville was ordered to [s]end a carriage at nine, and it being the la[s]t morning of my novitiate, I de[s]ired not be di[s]turbed till it was time for me to enter the chapel. This request I knew would be complied with, as it would be [s]uppo[s]ed, I wi[s]hed for time for meditation. Accordingly I early left my cell, and going to Edella's apartment, dre[s][s]ed my[s]elf in [s]ome of her cloaths, and put on a long black hood which would pull over the face; thus attired, I waited anxiou[s]ly for a ring at the gate and gue[s][s]ing it was the coach, hurried down [s]tairs, and [s]o prevented the portre[s]s from coming up to call Edella. I met [s]everal of the nuns as I pa[s][s]ed from her apartment to the door, but they neither [s]poke to me, nor attempted to [s]top me. I got out of the convent un[s]u[s]pected, and in le[s]s than an hour was in a place of [s]afety, where a prie[s]t immediately united me to my dear Vieurville. My fir[s]t de[s]ire was that we [s]hould fly to my father for his protection, intreat his pardon and ble[s][s]ing, and through his interce[s][s]ion be again received into the church, from whence I was certain we [s]hould be excommunicated. It was midnight when I arrived at my father's, he had been returned from Paris near four hours, whither he had rapaired to [s]ee me take the veil, and was then, overcome with fatigue and di[s]appointment, ju[s]t retired to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] re[s]t. I would not permit the [s]ervant to inform his ma[s]ter that I was come home, but following him up [s]tairs, threw my[s]elf on my knees by his bed-[s]ide. He [s]tarted at [s]eeing me, fury fla[s]hed from his eyes, and gra[s]ping my hand with violence, he cried, Agnes, ungrateful girl, why are you here? With tremulous accents, I in a few words told him I was married, and intreated his pardon and friend[s]hip. Oh! never [s]hall I forget his an[s]wer, 'twas awful, 'twas more than nature could [s]upport. He [s]purned me from him, he cur[s]ed me, and imprecated the wrath of heaven on his head if ever he forgave me. "I will not, [s]aid he, precipitate your impending fate, by betraying you to the eccle[s]ia[s]tical powers; go ha[s]ten to leave France, and if you can be happy oppre[s][s]ed by the weight of a father's cur[s]e, may you be [s]o!---Hence, begone, you offend my [s]ight." Vieurville forced me out of the room. During the time of my petitioning for pardon, my mother had aro[s]e, [s]he followed me down [s]tairs, ble[s][s]ed me, and promi[s]ed to u[s]e her intere[s]t with my father, to effect a reconciliation. She gave me all the ca[s]h the po[s][s]e[s][s]ed and [s]ome jewels that had been pre[s]ented me by a relation. When I em her for the la[s]t time, it [s]eemed like rending [s]oul and body a[s]under; but hope, that [s]weet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] [s]oother of the human mind, bore me up, and I flattered my[s]elf we [s]hould one day meet again. When we left my father's hou[s]e, we [s]et forward immediately for Calais, and from thence embarked for Dover, where, overcome by agitation and fatigue, I was [s]eized with a fever which brought me to the verge of the grave. During my illne[s]s Vieurville wrote to his father, and we now anxiou[s]ly await the arrival of an an[s]wer. Oh! may it be propitious, but my [s]ad heart pre[s]ages I [s]hall never more know happine[s]s: For my[s]elf, I could have borne it patiently, but when I think I have involved my dear Vieurville in misery, my brain [s]ickens and almo[s]t madne[s]s en[s]ues. My deare[s]t Augu[s]tina, if you do not re[s]olve to hate me, by one kind line convey [s]ome gleam of comfort to the agonizing heart of AGNES. When will my portion of mi[s]ery be full, when [s]hall I [s]ay there is no more to suffer. When I am laid in the  grave, when my eyes clo[s]e on this world and open to immortality, then Augu[s]tina may [s]ay, Agnes is at peace!

My mother, my only friend, is torn from me, and I have the additional mi[s]ery of thinking my di[s]obedience precipitated her end; [s]he drooped from the day I le[s]t France, and her confidential [s]ervant informed me, her la[s]t breath was [s]pent in intreating my father to pardon me, but he was inexorable. Vieurville has received an an[s]wer from his father; but, oh! my Augu[s]tina, what killing lines did it contain. Donna Clara had conceived a pa[s][s]ion for her cou[s]in, and from the time of his leaving Spain, fell into a profound melancholy, and when [s]he heard of his marriage, the agitation of her [s]pirits became too much for her weak frame to [s]upport, and a rapid decline carried her an early victim to the grave. Vieurville is di[s]inherited, di[s]owned, and loaded with a father's anger; but will you believe it, my friend, he [s]till loves the woman who has brought tho[s]e misfortunes upon him; but that love, that warm mutual affection that [s]ub[s]i[s]ts between us [s]erves only to heighten our mi[s]ery---for oh! what torture can compare to that of [s]eeing the object we love overwhelmed with di[s]tre[s]s we have not the power to mitigate? --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] I am a mother, Augu[s]tina, but far from feeling tran[s]port when cla[s]ping my infant to my heart, methinks his innocent eyes reproach me with bringing him into the world, when his only birth-right is wretchedne[s]s. Poverty, with haggard countenance, and famine, with cold griping hand, have taken up their abode in our dwelling. Mu[s]t I write it, mu[s]t the daughter of de Romani tell her friend, [s]he is in want of almost the common nece[s][s]aries of life!----Oh! bitter reflection, hard, hard ta[s]k, Agnes mu[s]t solicit charity of her friend Augu[s]tina!----And, alas! my friend, unle[s]s relief comes [s]oon, we mu[s]t peri[s]h! for in this [s]trange land what can we do? We cannot work, and (notwithstanding the known humanity of the Briti[s]h nation) we are a[s]hamed to beg. Oh! how blind are the dictates of pa[s][s]ion! how erroneous are its judgments! may none of my [s]ex henceforth li[s]ten to its delu[s]ive arguments, but by adhering to the precepts of rea[s]on, avoid the mi[s]eries of AGNES.

We have pa[s][s]ed from one degree of wretchedne[s]s to another, till a bundle of [s]traw, a dry cru[s]t, and a few rags that cover our emaciated frames, are the whole of our worldly po[s][s]e[s][s]ions, and to encrease my affliction, fix weeks [s]ince I brought into the world another child of [s]orrow. Gracious heaven! could words convey to my Augu[s]tina the extent of my mi[s]ery, could [s]he but for a moment, even in idea, experience my [s]ufferings;---but may the beneficent power that rules the world avert from her even the [s]hadow of [s]uch afflictions, may my bittere[s]t enemy never experience the pangs that at pre[s]ent harrow up my [s]oul.

Autumn had not put off her plea[s]ing robe, nor had the gentle zephyr for[s]ook the plain to give place to his rude-brother Boreas. The ground was [s]trewed with leaves of various hues; the ripened fruit hung on the bending trees, and fields of waving golden grain rendered the [s]cene delightful. Marian and Lydia having fini[s]hed their daily talk, [s]et a[s]ide their wheels with alacrity, and tying on their [s]traw bonnets, prepared to enjoy the beauties of the evening, by rambling over the adjacent fields and meadows.

Innocence presided over all their plea[s]ures, and meek-eyed content on downy pinions hovered over their homely couch, [s]weetening their quiet slumbers. Their cottage was [s]ituated in a plea[s]ant valley, on the borders of Wales; it was plain and rural, it contained every nece[s][s]ary, but no superfluities; [s]implicity had decorated it, and the neatne[s]s of its furniture rendered it more pleasing to the ru[s]tic inhabitants than the mo[s]t sumptuous palace. Here Marian and Lydia, by their chearfulne[s]s and indu[s]try, enlivened the declining hours of their mother Dorcas. Beware, [s]aid the careful mother, beware, my children, tarry not too long, left the evening lamps [s]hould impair your health, and rob your mother of her only comforts.

Sir George Lovemore had arrived a few days before at Gwinfred-Hall, to vi[s]it a maiden aunt, who[s]e unlimited fortune demanded this mark of re[s]pect, for the virtues of her mind, or the [s]weetne[s]s of her manner he was totally unacquainted with. Mrs. Gwinfred's unaffected piety, good-humour, and amiable di[s]po[s]ition, were things totally di[s]regarded by the young libertine, though the vi[s]it was profe[s][s]edly made to her, yet he [s]pent but a [s]mall [s]hare of his time in her company. He was continually rambling from one place to another, making vi[s]its to tho[s]e neighbouring gentlemen who[s]e opinions and manners mo[s]t [s]uited with his own. He was this evening returning from a vi[s]it to the Earl of Landaff, he was [s]eated in an elegant phaeton, drawn by four beautiful bays, his servants were in their be[s]t travelling liveries, which were green faced with buff, and [s]uperbly trimmed with gold lace, they proceeded [s]lowly, the animals [s]eeming to partake of their ma[s]ter's indolence. Marian and Lydia had wandered to the road, and were ju[s]t cro[s][s]ing it with an intent to enter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] a [s]mall wood on the other [s]ide, when this magnificent equipage impeded their way. They had never before [s]een any thing half [s]o grand--- they [s]topped involuntarily to admire it as it pa[s][s]ed; the wind had blown off Marian's bonnet, her luxuriant brown hair falling in ringlets over her face and neck, [s]erved as a [s]hade to heighten but not ob[s]cure her charms. Sir George caught a glimp[s]e of her per[s]on, and in her little white jacket, [s]imple, unadorned, [s]he appeared to him like a wood nymph; her form was delicate, her [s]tature rather below the middling [s]ize. He alighted from his phaeton, and offering his hand to Marian, [s]aid he would a[s][s]i[s]t her in cro[s][s]ing the road; he [s]eized her unreluctant hand, he gazed earne[s]tly upon her face, and felt in a moment his heart was captivated by this ru[s]tic fa[s]cinating beauty; the mode[s]t inobtru[s]ive charms of Lydia were unnoticed, he called her [s]i[s]ter by a thou[s]and divine appellations, which, as they had never heard them before, at once excited their wonder and their fears. Leave us, good Sir, [s]aid Lydia, for we mu[s]t return home, and [s]hould our mother [s]ee you, [s]he would be angry with us; be[s]ides, Sir, we country maidens are not u[s]ed to conver[s]e with [s]uch grand folks, and mayhap you will laugh [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] at our [s]implicity. They then dropped their curt[s]ies, and wi[s]hing him a good night, would have left him, but he [s]topped Marian, and attempted rudely to [s]alute her; [s]he [s]hrieked, [s]truggled, and at length freeing her[s]elf from his hold, caught her [s]i[s]ter's hand, and darting acro[s]s the field, they were pre[s]ently out of [s]ight. Sir George gazed after them for a moment, then, a[s]cending his carriage, determined in his own mind to attempt the [s]eduction of Marian, He made no doubt but [s]he would again walk the [s]ame way, and re[s]olved every night to ramble out in hopes of meeting her. The [s]i[s]ters [s]lackened not their pace till they arrived within [s]ight of their mother's cottage. Dorcas, unea[s]y at their long [s]tay, had walked forth to meet them; their ha[s]te and confu[s]ion alarmed her. Tell me, my children, [s]aid [s]he, why are you thus agitated? Has any thing frightened you, or has any of the low-bred clowns in[s]ulted you? Why would you walk [s]o late? Dear mother, cried Lydia, a gentleman stopped us, and was [s]o rude to my [s]i[s]ter. Not very rude, [s]aid Marian, interrupting her, he only wanted to ki[s]s me, and I ran away from him. But you cannot think what a fine [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] gentleman he was, [s]o hand[s]ome, and he had [s]uch a pretty thing to ride in; dear, dear, how I [s]hould like to ride in [s]uch an one. I am [s]urpri[s]ed, Marian, [s]aid Dorcas, gravely, to hear you talk thus; it becomes not a girl of your humble [s]tation to [s]peak in [s]uch raptures of the beauty of a gentleman, or the grandeur of his equipage, much le[s]s to form wi[s]hes to be indulged by riding in it. Why [s]urely, dear mother, [s]aid [s]he, it is no harm to wi[s]h. It is wrong, my dear child (replied the tender mother) very wrong to form wi[s]hes which we are certain, from the [s]ituation in which it has plea[s]ed Providence to place us, can never be laudably gratified. You know, Marian, 'tis impo[s][s]ible you can ever po[s][s]e[s]s a [s]plendid equipage. Oh! dear, [s]aid Marian, I do not think [s]o; mayhap the fine gentleman may be in love with me; I am [s]ure he called me by many pretty names. Dorcas [s]hook her head, and [s]ighed. And how, [s]aid [s]he, looking mournfully at Marian, how has vanity found entrance in a heart I had hoped was the [s]eat of innocence and content. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] Don't be angry with my [s]i[s]ter, dear mother, [s]aid Lydia, to be [s]ure the gentleman did talk a great deal about beauty and godde[s][s]es, but I dare [s]ay he meant nothing. That's nothing but envy, [s]aid Marian, peevishly, becau[s]e he did not [s]ay any thing to you. For of what u[s]e would it be to him to [s]ay I was the lovelie[s]t girl he ever [s]aw, if he did not think [s]o; that would be fibbing for fibbing's [s]ake. Dorcas [s]miled at her [s]implicity, while [s]he regretted that tho[s]e [s]parks of vanity which had ever lain dormant, had by flattery been blown into a flame. They entered the cottage, and [s]at down to a rural [s]upper of milk and fruit; during the repa[s]t Marian could think nor [s]peak of aught be[s]ide the gentleman. Lydia was [s]ilent, and Dorcas now and then [s]ighed profoundly, while a tear fell as [s]he reverted in her thoughts to occurrences long [s]ince pa[s]t; when they had fini[s]hed their temperate meal, [s]he thus addre[s][s]ed her daughters. My dear children, [s]aid [s]he, you have often heard me [s]ay, that you lo[s]t your father when you were quite infants: in that I told you truth; he is lo[s]t, irreparably lo[s]t to you and me, but it was not death that tore him from us. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] have ever avoided mentioning any of the occurrences of my pa[s]t life, le[s]t it [s]hould pain your gentle, affectionate hearts, but I find now the hour is arrived when the mother's [s]orrows [s]hall [s]erve as a warning to the daughters, to teach them to avoid tho[s]e [s]hoals and quick[s]ands on which were wrecked her happine[s]s and peace. Li[s]ten attentively, and while you weep over my misfortunes, let the errors which brought them on me [s]ink deep in your hearts; remember they were the cau[s]e of your mother's ruin, and [s]hun them through the cour[s]e of your own lives as you would any poi[s]onous or obnoxious reptile. PART II.

He in his youth, by integrity and fidelity, [s]o well recommended himself to the favour of the nobleman, of whom at that time he rented a farm, that he made him [s]teward of all his e[s]tates, which were [s]ituated in that country. I had the misfortune to lo[s]e my mother before I had [s]een [s]ixteen years; [s]he was a woman of exemplary piety, [s]he had early inculcated in my mind a love of religion and virtue, and taught me that humility, charity, and chearful content were the true marks of chri[s]tianity.----Had I never [s]uffered tho[s]e excellent precepts to depart from my mind, I [s]hould never have experienced the many mi[s]eries which have [s]ince marked my unhappy life. During the life of this worthy parent I lived extremely retired, [s]he [s]uperintended my education [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] which was [s]uch as might render me a u[s]eful member of [s]ociety, but [s]he be[s]towed very little time on the [s]hewy accompli[s]hments which are [s]et [s]o high a price on in the pre[s]ent age, and which, though they are certainly nece[s][s]ary to fini[s]h the education of a gentlewoman, are very immaterial to tho[s]e who expect to move but in the middle [s]phere. After my mother's decea[s]e I took the entire charge of my father's family upon me, did the honours of his table, received and entertained all his vi[s]itants, and made frequent excur[s]ions abroad; I was thoughtle[s]s, vain, and giddy. I never before heard the voice of adulation, which now a[s][s]ailed my ears from almo[s]t every man with whom I conver[s]ed. I li[s]tened to it eagerly, and like my [s]imple Marian placed an implicit faith in all they [s]aid. My heart was full of [s]en[s]ibility, and being deprived of my mother, whom I had ever [s]idered and loved as a friend, I began to look round for [s]ome female object on whom to [s]ettle tho[s]e affectionate feelings, to whom I might unbosom all my little inquietudes, con[s]ult and advise with on trifling embara[s][s]ments and vexations, which at that time I con[s]idered as [s]erious troubles. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] Unfortunately for me, the Earl of S--- to whom my father was [s]teward, at that time came into the country, and brought with him his daughter, Lady Laura S--- and a young gentleman whom I [s]hall call Melfont, he was the [s]econd [s]on of a noble family, and though then only nineteen years old, had obtained the rank of captain in the army; his fortune was large, having inherited his mother's jointure, but he had cho[s]en the profession of arms, as he thought the character of a good [s]oldier increa[s]ed the dignity of the gentleman. Lady Laura was nearly of my own age, chance one evening threw me in her way, as I was walking with my father, and though fortune had placed [s]o great a di[s]tance between us, [s]he prosessed a friend[s]hip for me, which highly gratified my vanity and delighted my father, as he thought it would contribute to my future advancement in life.---But alas! my children, it was the [s]ource from whence I might trace all my misfortunes. Lady Laura was lovely in her per[s]on, and gentle in her manners, [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a [s]u[s]ceptible heart, and I thought her the pattern of all female perfection; but in this I was woefully deceived. She had that [s]elfi[s]h principle inherent in her nature, which made her prefer her own happine[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] to that of the whole world be[s]ide; however, this was an error which I did not di[s]cover till [s]he had brought inevitable ruin on me, and unfeelingly triumphed in the mi[s]ery [s]he had occa[s]ioned. From the evening of our fir[s]t interview [s]he continually formed pretences to call at my father's, and at length, by the Earl's permi[s][s]ion invited me to pa[s]s a few weeks with her at Seymour Ca[s]tle. My father joyfully con[s]ented to my accepting the pro[s][s]ered honour, and the day being appointed, Lady Laura her[s]elf came in the chariot to fetch me. It was near dinner time when I arrived, I felt my[s]elf rather aba[s]hed on being pre[s]ented to the Earl, and con[s]cious of my inferiority, my face glowed with confu[s]ion. Lord S--- was a venerable and truly worthy nobleman; he [s]aid many obliging things to me, which in [s]ome mea[s]ure encouraged me, and I began to look and [s]peak with a tolerable degree of freedom, when being informed that dinner was [s]erved, the Earl led me into the dining room and pre[s]ented me to Cartain Melfont. All my confu[s]ion now returned. I blu[s]hed, trembled, and hardly knew how I behaved during dinner, I had never before conver[s]ed with a man [s]o well-bred, polite, and agreeable as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] Captain Melfont. I wi[s]hed to appear engaging, and con[s]cious of my own infignificance, [s]hrunk as it were into nothing, and a thou[s]and times wi[s]hed my[s]elf at home again. All day I was unea[s]y and di[s][s]atisfied with my[s]elf, every accomplishment Lady Laura di[s]played, made me regret not po[s][s]e[s][s]ing the [s]ame, that I might equally with her contribute to the amu[s]ement and [s]hare the applause of Melfont. In the cour[s]e of a few days my con[s]traint gradually decrea[s]ed, the polite freedom with which I was treated by Lady Laura, and the pointed attentions I experienced from Melfont, contributed to rai[s]e me in my own e[s]teem, and I became chearful and happy. As I had ever been accu[s]tomed to early ri[s]ing, I was in general up [s]ome hours [s]ooner than Lady Laura, and u[s]ually [s]pent the time till breakfa[s]t in the garden, [s]ometimes with a book, and sometimes with my work. Melfont had frequently joined me in the[s]e little morning excur[s]ions, and I believe it was the plea[s]ure I experienced in his company, which made me [s]o often repeat them. At fir[s]t he was polite, uncon[s]trained and chearful, but he [s]oon grew thoughtful, pen[s]ive, and even ab[s]ent. I [s]aw the change with regret; I almo[s]t unknown to my[s]elf [s]hared his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] uncasiness, and whenever he [s]ighed involuntarily, echoed his [s]ighs re[s]pon[s]ively. At length I a[s][s]umed courage to enquire the cau[s]e of his melancholy; he he[s]itated for a few moments, and then in faultering accents declared him[s]elf my lover, at the [s]ame time [s]aying, he had not the lea[s]t hope of ever being happy, conjured me to forget him, pre[s][s]ed my hand to his lips, and left me with precipitation. I now di[s]covered the [s]tate of my own heart, I felt the greate[s]t [s]atisfaction in the knowledge of being beloved; but my affliction was great when I reflected he had [s]aid an in[s]urmountable barrier was placed between us. I was weak enough to [s]hed tears, and could hardly [s]ummon compo[s]ure enough to attend Lady Laura, at the u[s]ual hour of breakfa[s]t---though I was conscious that the indulging an hopele[s]s pa[s][s]ion would entail la[s]ting mi[s]ery upon me, I never once attempted to [s]ubdue it, or [s]tifle emotions which my own rea[s]on told me were improper and imprudent in a young per[s]on in my humble [s]tation; though I am certain, had I when I fir[s]t discovered my growing partiality for Melfont, immediately left Seymour Ca[s]tle, returned home, and by entering with avidity into all my u[s]ual avocations, [s]trove to bani[s]h him from my mind, and avoided all opportunities of [s]eeing or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] conver[s]ing with him, I [s]hould [s]oon have conquered the predeliction, and regained my u[s]ual tranquility, but I wanted re[s]olution to fly the society of a man who[s]e pre[s]ence I fancied con[s]tituted my chief happine[s]s. Solitude is the nur[s]e of youthful pa[s][s]ion---in this I was fully indulged at Seymour Ca[s]tle, being allowed to pa[s]s my time in a manner mo[s]t [s]uitable to my own inclination, whil[s]t Lady Laura was engaged with her [s]everal ma[s]ters, who yet daily attended her. I had at the [s]ame time contracted a habit of reading for [s]everal hours in the day, and unfortunately in the late Countess's library met with [s]everal novels, a [s]ort of reading with which my dear girls are totally unacquainted; the[s]e books [s]erved only to [s]often my mind and encrea[s]e my pa[s][s]ion, [s]o that by never attempting to repel it in its fir[s]t approach, it in time gained an entire a[s]cendency over my heart, formed a part of my exi[s]tence, twined round the chords of life, and can be extinguished only by the hand of death. Here Dorcas pau[s]ed to give vent to her tears; Marian wept with her; Lydia threw her arms round her mother's neck, and ki[s][s]ing off the drops as they fell upon her cheeks, vowed that no action of hers [s]hould ever increa[s]e the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] anguish which already weighed down her too susceptible heart. They then retired for the night, Lydia to the [s]oft repo[s]e that ever attends youth and innocence; Marian to reflect on the fine things Sir George had [s]aid, and Dorcas to weep over pa[s]t afflictions.

For [s]everal mornings after the explanation I mentioned, I repaired as u[s]ual to the garden, but Mel[s]ont did not join me, indeed he [s]eemed particularly [s]tudious to avoid every opportunity of conver[s]ing with me without a third per[s]on being pre[s]ent. I was extremely unea[s]y at this conduct, I imagined he [s]uppo[s]ed me too much his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] inferior to be made the honorable partner of his fortune, and in my heart I thanked him for that honor, which prevented his [s]oliciting me on other terms; yet the vi[s]ible con[s]traint he put upon himself in attempting to appear chearful, pained me exce[s][s]ively; I became ab[s]ent, melancholy and dejected. Lady Laura frequently interrogated me in her lively manner on the cau[s]e of my altered diposition, and one morning when Melfont was in the room, [s]he jocularly [s]aid, "Why, my good cousin Charles, what in the name of wonder po[s][s]e[s][s]es you to be [s]o dull, one would think [s]ome enchantment prevailed at Seymour Ca[s]tle, and that the very air was infectious, here is my lively Dory, metamorpho[s]ed into mu[s]ing melancholy; and you, my late giddy cou[s]in become the grave sentimental philo[s]opher. I verily believe a certain blind deity has been bu[s]y with you, come hither, Charles, let me [s]ee where the arrow entered, is the wound deep?" Melfont an[s]wered rather peevi[s]hy, and left the room. I felt my face glow and my heart throbbed violently, Lady Laura [s]aw my emotion, "Poor dear, [s]aid [s]he, did it fall in love, and had it no hope; well, well, never mind it, 'twas all involuntary I'll be [s]worn." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] Oh! Lady Laura, [s]aid I, de[s]pi[s]e me not for my weakne[s]s.---I could [s]ay no more, tears bur[s]t from my eyes, and I hid my face with my handkerchief. "My dear Dory, [s]aid [s]he, taking my hand, I did not mean to pain your gentle heart, I have long [s]een the tenderne[s]s [s]ub[s]i[s]ting between my cou[s]in and you, and a[s][s]ure you it has given me peculiar plea[s]ure; but my [s]weet little friend, you mu[s]t be rather cautious to guard your [s]ecret, for [s]hould my father di[s]cover it, he will u[s]e every method to prevent an union between you ever taking place, for Charles Melfont is de[s]igned by him the hu[s]band of your Laura." Had I been transfixed by lightning, my countenance could not have expre[s][s]ed more horror and [s]urprize. I felt in a moment that I mu[s]t appear a mon[s]ter of ingratitude in the eyes of the Earl, when he [s]hould find I had thus, though unintentionally counteracted his de[s]igns, in regard to his daughter's future [s]ettlement. I told Lady Laura, after what I had ju[s]t heard, I [s]hould think my[s]elf unpardonable to remain any longer at Seymour Ca[s]tle, or ever [s]uffer Melfont to entertain me again in the character of a lover. I reque[s]ted her to [s]uffer me to return home, and [s]aid, I would, if po[s][s]ible, avoid ever [s]eeing him again. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] She laughed at what [s]he called my delicate [s]cruples, and told me, [s]he had in her own mind planned out future [s]chemes of happine[s]s for us all; for to tell you the truth, [s]aid [s]he, I have no great inclination to Charles, being engaged both by inclination and [s]olemn promi[s]es, to a young man of no great fortune, though of a good family; he is at pre[s]ent only an en[s]ign in the guards, [s]o that I am certain my father will never con[s]ent to our union; but you know, my dear Dory, if you accept Melfont, I can then avow my choice openly, and you will at once render your[s]elf happy, and confer an obligation on your friend. In this manner did the artful Laura work on my feelings, and at length won Melfont over to her party. We were frequently witne[s][s]es to private interviews between her lover and her[s]elf, and in a [s]hort time [s]o far forgot what was due to our parents, and to our own intere[s]t and honor, that we not only planned her e[s]cape but accompanied her [s]light, and the [s]ame ceremony united Lady Laura to Mr. Wal[s]h, and your mother to Melfont. When we returned to Seymour Ca[s]tle we found it a [s]eat of tumult and confu[s]ion; the Earl refu[s]ed us admittance, and my father, irritated at my ingratitude to his patron and benefactor, would not [s]uffer me to enter his habitation, not did I from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] that unhappy day ever [s]ee him; my behaviour had made [s]uch an impre[s][s]ion on his mind, that he fell into a deep melancholy, which [s]oon put a period to his exi[s]tence; the whole of his possessions were left to his neare[s]t male relation, and my name was only mentioned in the will, that he might reprobate my ingratitude. I can truly [s]ay, the affliction I felt when informed of his decea[s]e, proceeded [s]olely from the reflection, that I de[s]erved his anger, and had not [s]een him or endeavoured to gain his pardon before his death. The angui[s]h of my heart was beyond expression, but the unremitting tenderne[s]s which I experienced from my hu[s]band [s]oon hu[s]hed my griefs to re[s]t, and I became tranquil, and even happy.---Alas! this [s]cene of [s]erene plea[s]ure was not long to la[s]t; it fleeted away like a vision, and like a pa[s][s]ing [s]hadow left no trace behind. One year of connubial love was pa[s]t, when you, my beloved girls, were in one day u[s]hered into the world. Melfont was di[s]appointed, he had hoped for a boy, as his family had never been reconciled to what they termed [s]o disproportionate a match, he imagined [s]uch an event might in [s]ome mea[s]ure have conciliated their regard, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] but the birth of my daughters fru[s]trated the[s]e hopes; however he [s]till continued the kind attentive hu[s]band. I lived extremely retired, con[s]oling my[s]elf for the lo[s]s of every plea[s]ure which a per[s]on of my age might wi[s]h to enjoy, in Melfont's affection; and while that continued I had no wi[s]h ungratified. Lady Laura frequently vi[s]ited me; her father had never forgiven her precipitate marriage, nor did he ever give her any fortune. Wal[s]h had married more from the hope of aggrandizing him[s]elf than from any affection he felt for her Lady[s]hip. When he found the[s]e hopes were illu[s]ive he threw off the ma[s]k, and treated her with contempt and unkindne[s]s, by which means he rendered her life extremely wretched. She [s]aw the love and harmony which between your father and me, and from that spint of envy which hates to [s]ee happine[s]s in another family, which it cannot enjoy at home, [s]he determined to undermine my felicity, and render me as completely wretched as her[s]elf. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] There is a caprice in the heart of man, or rather a depravity in their natures, which leads them to neglect and de[s]pi[s]e a woman totally in their power, and pur[s]ue with avidity tho[s]e who by almo[s]t in[s]urmountable ob[s]tacles, are placed at a di[s]tance from them. This was exactly the ca[s]e with Melfont. When Lady Laura was offered to him by her father, when wealth and honor would have attended his acceptance of her, he rejected her---but now, irrevocably united to me, and Laura the wife of another, he began to feel a pa[s][s]ion for her, and to wi[s]h he had not married [s]o precipitately. This pa[s][s]ion was at fir[s]t admitted into his bo[s]om under the ma[s]k of pity, he would li[s]ten to the frequent complaints [s]he made of her hard fate, [s]oothe her di[s]tre[s]s, and offer every con[s]olation in his power. For [s]ome time I joined him in endeavouring to alleviate the [s]orrows of the unhappy Laura; but at length his attentions to her became too pointed to e[s]cape the penetrating eye of watchful tenderness, and I was unable to [s]tifle that jealou[s]y which I had long [s]trove to [s]uppre[s]s. However afflicted I might be, at the vi[s]ible alteration in your father's manner, I [s]uffered no complaint to break forth, but nur[s]ed my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] corroding [s]orrows in [s]ilence and [s]olitude; in his presence I endeavoured to appear chearful, though my heart was almo[s]t broken by his unkindness. Two years had pa[s][s]ed in this dreadful manner, when Mr. Wal[s]h died, and Lady Laura became a blooming widow. Lord S---, her father, was at that time upon the continent, therefore [s]he had no opportunity to make an immediate per[s]onal application to him for reconciliation. Lady Laura had long treated me with a cool , [s]he now no longer wore even the semblance of politene[s]s, but whenever [s]he came to the hou[s]e, would either not [s]peak to me at all, or treat me with the mo[s]t cruel di[s]re[s]pect. I ventured to complain to Melfont of her ungenerous behaviour, when his an[s]wer [s]truck me almost dumb with [s]orrow and a[s]toni[s]hment. I am [s]urpri[s]ed, Madam, [s]aid he, that you [s]hould complain to me in this manner, what right have you to expect particular attention from a woman of Lady Laura's di[s]tinction, I think [s]he does you too much honor by  to enter the hou[s]e where you live. You [s]hould consider, Dory, you are only my mi[s]tre[s]s. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] Your mi[s]tre[s]s, Melfont? Yes, [s]urely; you know I was under age when the ceremony was performed. I have never introduced you to my family as my wife, nor have they ever con[s]idered you as [s]uch." I heard no more, a cold damp came over me, I [s]huddered and fell lifele[s]s to the floor.---When I recovered, I found your cruel father had left me, in that [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility, to the care of the [s]ervants. I gave free vent to my [s]orrows in a flood of tears, and then [s]ummoning all the fortitude I could to my a[s][s]i[s]tance, called for pen and ink, and wrote a letter to Melfont, a copy of which I have pre[s]erved. - SIR, Since you inform me I am not your wife, be a[s][s]ured I retain too high a [s]en[s]e of honor to remain with you on any other terms; but do not flatter your[s]elf I mean tamely to give up a title which I think I have an undoubted right to, having received it at the altar, and borne it three years, during which time I have never di[s]graced it by thought, word, or action. Before you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] receive this, I [s]hall be far advanced on my way towards Paris, where I mean to [s]ubmit my cau[s]e to the deci[s]ion of the Earl of S---, who, though I have greatly injured, is the only per[s]on I can at this time with propriety apply to, or hope to receive a[s][s]i[s]tance from. I know him to be a nobleman of too much honor and humanity to [s]uffer an in[s]ult offered to an unprotected woman to go unrevenged. He is the friend of the widow and the fatherle[s]s, and in that rank I mu[s]t place myself, and your unhappy children, till you re[s]tore me to that which no action of mine has ever for . Your affectionate, but injured wife, DORCAS MELFONT. When I had fini[s]hed this letter I ordered a chai[s]e and four, and bidding the [s]ervant put up a few things, took you, my beloved girls, and de[s]iring the letter might be delivered to your father when he came home, which I knew would not be till late at night, [s]et off full [s]peed to Dover. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] We travelled all night, and was lucky enough to arrive ju[s]t as a packet was [s]ailing for Calais, I immediately embarked, a few hours wa[s]ted us acro[s]s the channel, and I then travelled with as much [s]peed as po[s][s]ible to Paris. It was late when I arrived, and being greatly fatigued with my journey, I determined to [s]tay till the next morning before I waited on the Earl. I took an ha[s]ty [s]upper and retired, in hope to recruit my exhausted frame by [s]leep. The next morning I aro[s]e early, and dre[s][s]ing my[s]elf, took my dear children in my hand, and repaired to the Earl's. I was with difficulty admitted, and when I entered the room where his Lord[s]hip was at breakfa[s]t, my agitation was [s]o great I could [s]carcely [s]tand. Dorcas! [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, [s]tarting from his [s]eat. Oh! my Lord, [s]aid I, (throwing my[s]elf at his feet, and pre[s]enting my girls to him) behold a mi[s]erable woman and two helple[s]s infants, who without your a[s][s]i[s]ting hand mu[s]t be plunged infamy and inevitable ruin. Ri[s]e, Dorcas, [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, explain yourself, your agitation at pre[s]ent deranges your ideas. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] I then in a few words told him, that Melfont had di[s]owned me for his wife, and that I was certain he meant to marry Lady Laura. Heaven forbid, [s]aid the Earl, that my poor in girl [s]hould add [s]uch an heinous offence again[s]t humanity, to the catalogue of her former crimes. Oh! Dorcas, her undutiful behaviour has been like a viper preying upon my heart; and to increa[s]e my affliction, I have been told [s]he has di[s]honored even the man for whom [s]he for[s]ook her father's protection. But this will be an act to make honor and humanity blu[s]h. Be comforted, continued he, for the [s]ake of the[s]e poor innocents, I will not [s]uffer your wrongs to pa[s]s unnoticed or unredre[s][s]ed. Cheared by the[s]e kind expressions I returned to my lodgings, with a heart con[s]iderably lightened, and was de[s]ired to call on the Earl again in about ten days, when he [s]hould have had time to con[s]ult what was be[s]t to be done. On the appointed morning I repaired to the Earl, I found him [s]eated at a table writing, a letter lay unfolded before him. Dorcas, [s]aid he, (ri[s]ing and leading me to a [s]eat) I have received letters from England [s]ince I [s]aw you. Do they mention me, my Lord? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] Yes, they [s]ay you have long led a very dissolute life, and that you have eloped from your husband with a young officer, and taken with you a quantity of money and jewels. Heaven forgive them, [s]aid I, and bur[s]t into tears. But this is not all, my poor girl, continued the Earl, you have wor[s]e trials than this to encounter. Then I hope God will give me fortitude to [s]upport them, [s]aid I, but indeed my heart is almost broke already. However, my Lord, let me know the wor[s]t, and I will endeavour to bear it with patience. Melfont is married to Lady Laura. Cruel Melfont, how have I de[s]erved this inhuman u[s]age. After you left me the other day, [s]aid the Earl, I [s]ent a me[s][s]enger expre[s]s to endeavour to procure a certificate of your marriage, and to take a letter to Laura, promi[s]ing pardon and forgetfulne[s]s of all that was pa[s]t if [s]he would not marry Melfont, but in ca[s]e [s]he cho[s]e to follow the bent of her own depraved inclination, to never a[s][s]ume the title of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v1&image=326-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] my daughter again, for from that moment I would di[s]own her. My me[s][s]enger returned ye[s]terday, and informs me, it is impo[s][s]ible to procure a certificate, as the clergyman who married you was dead, and that the day after you left England, Melfont publicly e[s]pou[s]ed Lady Laura. Merciful heaven, [s]aid I, ([s]inking on my knees) to your care I commit my dear injured children. Oh! [s]uffer them not to be puni[s]hed for the [s]ins of their parents; make me the object of thy wrath for my di[s]obedience and ingratitude, but Oh! of thy infinite mercy avert the [s]hafts of keen adversity from the bo[s]om of my beloved girls. The Earl was affected, he dropped a tear in compa[s][s]ion to my angui[s]h, and promi[s]ed to be my protector. The next day he gave me a deed, in which he [s]ettled this cottage and its appendages, with one hundred pounds a year, on me during my life, and to be continued to my children as long as they by their conduct [s]hould merit his protection. I remained in France a few days, ju[s]t to recruit my [s]trength and [s]pirits, and then [s]et forward for this place, where I have lived now [s]eventeen years, endeavouring to form the minds of my children in [s]uch a manner, that the follies which occa[s]ioned their mother's misfortunes might never find entrance in their hearts.
