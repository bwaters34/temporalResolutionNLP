 Secondly, because you know mee, and I hope haue not noted myne Herodias , to bee either detraction or slander. And lastly, because you being versed amongst great men, and in great societies (where my wits-whipping post is onely erected) may, if you be pleased, say; when they say my worke sauours of ostentation, that it is the least sinne my soule labours vnder. For that power which did (and there was great reason it euer should to do) gouerne all the powers within mee, by a forcible commandement bound mee to doe what is done, the name and methode being neither of mine election: But why should I trouble your eares with this Apology? It sufficeth me that if you say it speaketh good English, I shall bee much negligent of any other mans derision; for it is vertue and iudgement, not titles and apparell that I seeke to satisfie: Bee you then pleased, not to be displeased with mine vnacquainted dedication, and I shall euer liue knit to your loue faithfull. G. M. my wordes. seeing the first part of this booke walke abroad without any liuery of Dedication on his backe, tiranously ceaz'd him, and neuer left till he brought him to the house of Correction to be iudged by the maisters of all criticall opinions. O how lamentably pale the poore booke lookt in the Margent. Whilst one sayes (and thinkes he sayes wisely) that the name showes the naturall pride of the parents; as if none should be cal'd Alexander that could not conquer the world, nor any Iacob that could not deceiue his brother; nor this Arcadia , except by many degrees it could exceed the whole world both in words and inuention: Forgetfull how many God-brothers, and selfe-like Pamphelts had past through the world with the same title. Another sayes, the alusion is not tollerable; as if pooremen should not borrow from the rich, or that vertue should euer liue so alone, that no man should dare to bee her imitator. Nay, saies a third, the great high-treason of all, is to make Noble Sir Phillip Sidney acquainted, either with Diana , or else Heliodorus , as if the excellency of his minde had disdained that which first brought it to perfection (Iudiciall reading)  o no, were he on the earth, he would repine at their curiosity, and tell them, that his contemplatiue labour first brought him to actiue worthinesse. Thus was the poore booke mightly accused, and seuerely threatned, till appealing to scholer-like discretion (which with fauour ballanceth words and their interpretations) hee was acquit, without any farther wounding then that which folly had imposed. From which, since no Art can defend it selfe, wisedome hath giueu their carping this curse, that his blowes shall not smart, nor his worst enuy be at any time regarded. O you then of little learning and great boast, be fauourable to this poore fragment of paper, and though it receiue some buffets from your lips, yet out of the charity, with which you are not acquainted, let not your enuies finde more faults then are visible, so shall the Authour, heereafter, extoll your patience, and no more laugh at your wants of iudgement. G. M. Arcadia, making vp the first compleate History. eares of change-desiring-man; are so full of hony-poysons, that with our vncloid appetites wee seeke to swallow that with delight, which with greatest earnestnesse wee haue fled from, and eschew'd as our worst torment; al-be the face carry euer one character, onely the shape, disguis'd in a roabe of new fashion, as (most excellent sonne) thou shalt perceiue by this continuance of my most true History. For no sooner had the Maiden, wonder of all beauties, (I meane the incomparable Princesse Mellidora ) and the sharpe witted Ethera , conueyed my drowsie-dead-seeming body into a priuate Arbor, adioyning vnto the Chappell of the great God Pan , but there, they two, with there dainty hands, disrob'd me of my gowne, of my hood, of my booke, of my beads, of my glasse, and of my staffe; and surely had not my old age bene so inseparably fixed to my constitution, that it was not in the power of a moment to take away the worke of many yeeres, I thinke they had not left it alone to continue with me; and with these, which were the high ornaments of my age, the Nymph Ethera disadorned the Princesse, and so couertly couered the beames of beauty, youth, and all excellency, in the shadow of decrepitnesse, old age, and long miseries, that euen Truth it selfe at that time might haue bene mis-taken in Truth-knowing; and thy selfe (my sonne) wouldst haue said (hadst thou seene so goodly a body in so humble a monument) that there was neuer Iewell of greater worth more basely inammelled. But hauing brought to passe, the first act of the cunning Nymphes passages (which was disguis'd) she conuei'd the Princesse to the former seate where they first found mee, and there, with many pretty coniurations of affectation in speech, humility in action, doubt in resolutions, sanctity in ceremonies, and a generall secrecy euen in despight of loues worst commandement; the Nymph Ethera left the Princesse to the hazard of fortune, and the manage of her owne wittes, whilst she returned to me, that was all drowned in sleep, and arming her selfe to giue sleepe a greater power, who had taken from mee all power but sleeping, she sang this triumphant P aean ouer mee, insteed of a lullaby.  Care and complaint, you sonnes of loues vnrest, Sighes, teares and thoughts, the foode of discontent, Flie farther from mee then the East from West, For all my woes and mourning times are spent: And come faire Hope, Truths comfort, and Desire , You that haue blinded Argus thousand eyes, The tel-tale Moone, and all those spots of fire, Which to the close night are continuall spies: O! come and banquet with my pleased heart, Whilst my sighes breath to musicke turnes his aire, Disgrace to grace, and paine to pleasures part All my dislike to all I can hold deere: For since my hope in spight of hope is wonne My loue to hope by none shall be vndone. But during the time that the Nymph, with her charming melody, added a superfluous fetter to mine already bound vp senses, The Princesse, with a minde, variously ouer-burthened with hope, with feare, with desire, with amazement, and with all the extremest worst of confused passions; sate, infinitely longing for that some-thing, which she more, infinitely, feared would present her with nothing; till in the end, casting her faire eye-sight, from the cloudy curtaines of her aged disguise, shee might discerne Siluagio , and diuers others of his fellow Forresters, accompanied with the discreete Oppicus ; and many other Shepeheards came marching towards her; and behind them, as a man forlorne, and euen vnworthy of society, she might behold the most miserable Thirsis (whose heauy pace, keeping time with the heauinesse of his thoughts, shewed that the honour of griefe was onely extreme heavinesse) borne more vpon the feete of his wofullest cogitations, then the faire wings of any desired hope, came with such true deiectment, and impossible to be feyned humility, that euen sorrow it selfe would haue confessed shee had no throne more strong or beautifull then his sorrowfulnesse; As soone as the Forresters were come into the presence of the Princesse (as then supposed to bee the Priest and Prophet to the great God Pan ) Siluagio with a Gentlemanly ciuility, presenting vnto her the side of an excellent Bucke of that season, spake in this manner. Father, (said he) as your pursuite of vertue hath brought you to the most honourable title of the most vertuous, and as your adoration to your God hath brought you to the seruices of men; so let me (in the name of all the Forresters of these Thessalian lands, dedicate to the great Goddesse Diana ) humbly intreate, from the depth of your Prophetique and admired wisedome, some ample cure for the vnexpressable sorrow of the euer-best-deseruing Thirsis ; the rather, sith thereby, our Forrest lands, and delightfull Groues, shall receiue, euen, a new verdure, and a flourishing beauty, from the sweete musicke of his excellent inuention, and your selfe the honour of performing the best worke of mortality; to which, shall be knit the eternall prayers of after-liuing-ages. Scarcely, had Siluagio deliuered this vrging Oratory, when Oppicus , (as a man fearefull to bee late in the seconding of so notable a businesse) stept euen betwixt his voice and his inuention, and presenting vnto the supposed Prophet a new slaine Kid, with that rurall grauity, which, euen of wisedome it selfe, is accounted the most honest, modestly spake in this manner. Accept (quoth he) deere Father I beseech thee the symple presents of the country Sheepheards, we dare not to tempt thee with the garish poyson of the Citty potentate; our naked life is an enemy to such glistering noysomnesse; little is our substance, little our desires, and least of all our ambitions; those fruits to our tasts are most delitious to which our hands are father, the earth mother, and our owne toiles the mid-wife; and the cleere springs do sooner coole the burnings of our thirsts, then the rich clusters of the most fruitfulst Vine-yard: our want and our wishes haue both one poise without disorder; therefore, such as wee haue accept from such as wee be; a tender Kid, the Iewell of many Flockes, which we wish may be a propitious sacrifice to the great God Pan and thee, that yet, ere our sorrowes be full sum'd vp with dispaire, we may behold some reliefe for our vnrelieued Thirsis . This said, another Shepeheard presents her with a bunch of rootes, which, he vowes, sprang to their greatnesse with no other moisture then the teares he had shed vpon them to behold Thirsis sorrowfulnes. Another presents her with Cakes and Cracknels, which hauing bene ordained for the solemnity of much triumph, were now made petitioners for the greatest sorrow: And thus, one after one, they present her with many gifts, yet make suit but for one goodnesse, which was, the health of him that was the health of all that beheld him; in so much, that when the Princesse beheld their generall lamentations, she could not forbeare, but in spight of resolution, thus to suffer pitty (though a stranger) to speak vnto her heart. Poore Thirsis , how art thou bemon'd of all, saue onely of her, of whom thou hast deserued more then most of all; And as it would haue more spoken, bashfulnesse control'd it, while Thirsis himselfe approaching neere vnto the supposed Hermite, after the vaile of his Bonnet, and the well grac'd bent of a comely knee, thus spake vnto her. Good father, as by the diuine augurisme of your holy knowledge, there is left nothing vn-reuealed, either what my starres presage, or my destiny hath prefixed, touching the vnhappy passage of my misfortun'd life; so let me humbly intreate, that for the accomplishment of my dispaire, I may know the end of my desires. Sonne, (quoth the Princesse, with an orderly well chang'd voyce) first let me vnderstand what it is that you desire? I desire (quoth he) the grace and fauour of the most excellentest creature that euer Nature acknowledged: What is her name (quoth the Princesse?) Melidora (said the Shepeheard) and at that word a sigh flew with such violence from his bosome, that his body, like a windy impostume, made all his members shake. O (said the Princesse) I know her well, she is a proud and disdainefull dame, and full of all the curiosities of greatnesse. O fie, (said Thirsis ) that blasphemy should come from goodnesse; I tell you she is as farre from pride, as Deity from sinne, and as great an enemy to disdaine as vertue to vitiousnesse; alas! she will not tread vpon a respectlesse worme, nor will she remoue her eye from the worst of miserie: O shee is all that euer can be said to bee compleate; and, onely, a modest and sweete regard of honour is the opposition of my happinesse; for she preferres a loue more worthy (though not more true) before mee: Then (said the Princesse) run in an euen line, prefer some other before her. Bid me (said the Sheepheard) create a second Nature, make a new world, set Saturne in his first gloriousnesse: all is more easie, then to alter my resolution. Darest thou not (said the supposed Hermite) with the helpe of thy friends, attempt to steale her, if opportunity should present her vnto thee? Not for this whole words Monarchy (said Thirsis ) vnblemisht affection can bee compelled by no violence, and may mine eies sooner fall from my head then such villany should issue from mine actions. Why (said the Princesse) dare you aduenture to conquer her by charmes? If (said the Sheepheard) the eternall tribute of an euerlasting faith; the neuer-ending-seruice of a continuall working soule; if the tedious suite of a wretched fortune; the prayers of dilacerated misery, or the desert of constancy had power to inchant: O shee had long since bene bewitched with vnloosable incantations. But this examination (Father) doth but call backe my haplesnes: I beseech you what successe will follow my fortunes? Thy fate (said the Princesse) hath bene full of affliction, and thy fortunes to come are accompanied with great doubts; looke in this glasse and tell me what thou beholdest therein; and with that she drew forth the Prophetique mirrour, into which the Sheepheard gaz'd with such earnestnesse of minde that calling all his powers and sences into his eies they seem'd to hold a counsaile in his misery; in the end he told her, hee saw nothing but a weather-wrackt ship, tost and turmoi'ld on a tempestious sea; hauing neither Maister, Pilot, Card, nor Compasse; yet in despight of the vnruly billowes she made forth her way, not by the direction of Art, but, onely, by the hand of Fortune; vpon her Keele (he said) he saw an inscription, which being drawne in large characters appear'd to be Scinditur incertum ; at which words the Princesse tooke the glasse from his sight, and commanded him, without daring the trouble of more words, to depart, and thinke on the incertaineties he had seene. Well (said the Shepeheard, with a sigh as heauy as his countenance) my life hath bene onely the companion of Danger, and my present estate is the throne of all fearefulnesse; yet when all Art, wit, and industry shall refuse me, Fortune may erect the broken Pyramid of my desteny; but alas, I delude my fancy with a flattering hope, and yet whatsoeuer is, is incertaine, is euer indifferent, and may proue well in dispight of Enuy. And when he had thus said, he turned about to his friends, and taking Siluagio by the hand hee departed, saying. I am the slaue of Fortune: Oh that her inconstancy and my misery might expire in one moment; but scarcely was he gotten out of the view of the holy well, when Diatassan , by another path, ariued before the presence of the Princesse, and beholding her with deceiued eies, he said; All the blisse that can be wisht to goodnesse accompany thy holy meditations, for if my eyes be not erronious intelligencers you belong to the holy Chappell of our great God Pan . I honour (said the Princesse) him and it. Then reuerent Father (said the Sheepheard) as you haue from the world (by the reuelation of doubfull Oracles, by vertue vnspeakeable, and a sober life vnimitable) wonne an honour, which shall liue, when euen time is consumed; so let me intreate you to deliuer the iudgement of your wisedome, in a case that's intricate, and begirts me with much torment. The Princesse, beholding her Sheepheard with the iealous eies of a suspitious feare, was so transported with distempered passions, that wisedome had much a do to gouerne affection: Yet desire to know what of all things she desired not to know, so temper'd both her will and actions, that with a voice which was musicall, euen in feyned roughnesse, she said. Whence (Sheepheard) growes the ground of thy torment? From this (he replied) I serue a Nymph in holy, vnspotted, and neuer-changing- loue, and desire the end of my hope, which is onely enioyment. What is her name (said the Princesse?) Men call her Apheleia : with which word, he thunder-struck the Princesse in such sort, that passion, breaking the bonds of reason, she could not forbeare, but with a loud voyce cry'd, Ha ; at which emphasis, wisedome control'd her admiration, and smothering her displeasure, till it had gotten more ripenesse; with wordes, sutable to a constrain'd patience, she said: Where (gentle Sheepheard) did your first acquaintaince take knowledge of that Nymph? At Minerua's Spring (answered he:) Vpon what day (said she?) Vpon Minerua's feast (quoth hee) at what time, the euening wooing the Sunne to abate much of his brightnesse; she, with many of her sisters, resorted to the holy Well, where they sung, and danc't so rarely about it, that neither Fairy, nor Angell, but might haue learnt perfection from her motions. What fauour (said the Princesse) did she giue you? I, now you touch my doubtful vexation (said he;) she gaue me this pretious and wel-wrought Iewel which I weare for her, in which is curiously purtraid, by the hand of an vnmatchable worke-man, the boundlesse bounding spheres of heauen, which with their continuall motions, runne eternally about the earth, within the brightnesse of which Firmament is written Manens Moueor , an Enygma Father, which your wisedome, onely, must make me vnderstand. It seemes (said the Princesse) her iealousy mistrusts your faithfulnesse. Do you not loue some other Nymph besides her? No Nymph (quoth he) on earth but her. Take heed (said she) reuolt is enemy to all vertuousnesse. By heauen and earth (quoth he) And as his mouth was euen big swolne with execrations, shee stopt them in his Throate, saying: O for mercies sake, sonne, do not sweare, they blaspheme which teach that Ioue respects not louers periuries; beleeue it, thunder had not bene made, had it not bene to reuenge such faithlessenesse; Why the oaths of louers, are the Carols of Angels, so that the Gods themselues keepe them in an eternall memory: And as she was pursuing this speech, he interrupted her earenestnesse saying. Father, resolution, that should euer bee armed with wisedome; and that wisedome which euer should direct vs in a vertuous path, when wee stand before such holy ones as your selfe, fortefies me so strongly, that here I dare boldly vow, in the sight of heauen and earth, and as I hope for enioyment of the ioyes my soule desireth, by the faire spring which is the luster of our first profits; and by those dry seasons which preserue our Flockes from perishing, I loue on earth no Nymph but Apheleia . Shal I say it was a rage? o no her patience was victor ouer such passions. Shall I say it was a iealous enuy? no, her temperance was neuer acquainted with such furies. Shall I say it was a violence vnbounded which then ceaz'd on the Princesse? no her wisedome was euer greater then her affections? But it was an vnkind griefe; or a griefe mixt with so much ouermaistring vnkindnesse, that she, not being able any longer to endure his vnnaturall apostacy, throweth the Hermites weede from her backe, and like the Sunne appearing from the darke cold Ocean, she discouers her owne natiue beames in their worthiest perfection; yet her minde, so gouern'd by a sorrow which was like anger, that euenin the casting off her disguise, she said. Can heart or eares endure this falshood? thou Traytor to vertue, loue, and the life of Ladies; thou false, disloyall, and the most periur'd of all Sheepeheards: thou canker of affection, thou impostumation vpon the eye of goodnesse; thou to whom no Epithiton can be giuen equall with thy wickednesse. I pray thee pardon mee, thyne euill hath made my tongue much more euill; indeed I haue not heretofore bene acquainted with rayling, it is the madnesse of my passion, not the fault of my nature; excuse it with thyne owne crime, and onely to thee that art the worst of man, here me vtter these few complainings. Didst thou not once, with a minde (in mine appearance) well setled and preiudicate, sweare by thy Sheepheards crooke, (the ensigne of thy profession) by thy Bow and Darts, (the instruments of thy pleasure;) and by the Deity of Minerua (the Patronesse of our Tempe ?) Nay, hast thou not cal'd euery Planet to witnesse, and inuok't euery Starre to beare record, that no creature but my selfe had place in thine affection? and art thou now thus suddainely trans-form'd-and dis figured? Beleeue it, thy Sheephooke will no more performe it's office, and thy Bow will breake when thou takest most delight in't, Minerua will spit thee from her walkes; the Planets will runne in opposition with thy fortunes; and the Starres will droppe from heauen before they will giue light to thy foote-steps, O Apheleia, Apheleia , I made a scorne of thy modest seriousnesse, but the disgrace is fixed on mine owne countenance: Did I, vnkind Sheepe-heard, (wrath would terme thee worse) discouer all that past betwixt that vertuous Nymph and my selfe, in the holy Fane of our Goddesse, that thereby thou should disgrace and deride me? Do but call into thy remembrance (if thy memory haue left in it any seate for goodnesse) the aduancements I haue giuen thee? ranking thee before the best worth, and making thee most worthy in mens praises, that art all vnworthinesse in thine owne nature: For thy sake, the mirrour of all wit and perfection, the most deseruedly-admired Thirsis , he that hath euer flowne with his owne plumes, whom men adore for his owne goodnesse, not for the countenance of greatnesse; whose vnlimited affection is the schoole of true loue; whose noble constancy makes the two poles ioy in their firmenesse; and whose faith, like the Sunne, liues euer without a companion: He, euen he, whose sorrowes hath bred sorrow in all things which haue sence; was for thee, heart-slaine, forsaken, and despised: What shall I say, my big swolne heart will breake with thy presence; thine eie poysons my eie like the Cockeatrice, I pray thee depart and leaue me. Nay, why stirrest thou not? Shame, and our debts, make vs euer abandon company; and who more laden with both then thy selfe? O let them carry thee, where not so much as eccho may be acquainted with thee. During all this speech, the courtly inconstant Diatassan ; not, as if hee had seene the deformednesse of Medusa , but, as if all the beauties of heauen and earth had bene gathered together in one face, and that made onely his obiect: stood like a Marble statue, stiffe, staring, and vnmou'd; now he imagines her fairer then she was, (though no excellency was able to adde to her perfection) onely her grieued bashfulnesse in blushes made the roses of her cheekes a little more glorious; and her displeased anger, accompanied with palenesse, made her lillies seeme whiter then Nature would imitate: Now his amazement cals his heart a recreant, and vowes, but in her, there is no delight nor felicity; faine would he speake, but shame keepes him tongue-tide; faine would he find excuse, but truth stands a witnesse against him; faine would he beg mercy, but dispaire keepes an account of his merits: To bee briefe, in her countenance he beholds so much glorious indignation, that but by his death, onely, he can yeeld her no satisfaction: Yet in the end, beholding her ready to depart, desirous to let her know his griefe, for his ingratitude, he staies her by her garments, and falling to the earth, vpon his knees, hee said. Thou best of the best of diuine creatures, O be gracious to my last of miseries, vouchsafe me a moment in thy memory, and howsoeuer my falshood and vnworthinesse hath dis-figured my fortunes, yet let the suddainenesse of my death be a mittigation, though no satisfaction; beleeue it, these teares shall neuer cease, till they haue gal'd me to the bone, and bred cankerous vlcers to consume me; nor shall my sighes haue easy passage from my heart, till hauing wasted my bloud, they split it in many peeces; yet before I perish thus strangely, pardon,  o pardon, I beseech thee, this first offence that euer I committed against loue, vertue, or thee; be like the Gods in quality as in beauty, so shall mercy euer be predominant in thee; see, Lady, these hands I lift to heauen and you, which with weakenesse, that issues from my shame, feebly fall backe againe; if you please to prolong the torment of your displeasure, I yeeld to the sharpenesse of your sentence, and when dispaire hath banisht pitty all mediation, my willing death shall publish my recantation; and as hee was thus speaking, she violently drew her garments from him, and with a countenance, which might giue him knowledge she was more and more offended, she said. For euer may that enchanting engine of thy speech be dumbe when it should plead for pitty; and whensoeuer myne eares shall receiue that sound, let them loose the sence of all sounds whatsoeuer. And this said, away she went from; his presence, like a Westerne gale kissing the checkes of the spring-tides flowers, leauing the Sheepheard euen distraught with discontentment, and the Nymph Ethera to repaire those disorders which this Stratageme had bred in my Cell. When the two-fold louing Diatassan saw the Princesse was vanisht beyond the leuell of his eies, and that the truth of his iudgement had taken a perfite suruey of her perfections: (for we seldome misse good things till we haue lost them) his loue so doubled and encreased, that where before, in the blisse of his enioyment, his affection burnt in a milde temper, now it rages in an vnplacable flame, and is borne with such violence, that nothing accompanies his thoughts but sorrow, melancholy, and desperation. Now iealousy gets a seate in his braine, and makes him contriue a thousand proiects to preuent Thirsis from aspiring to his wishes; now he will die to satisfie her in the power where-with her displeasure doth gouerne him; and then againe, he will liue to make amends for his errour, by some noble and worthy seruice: thus variously carried vpon the Ocean of his distempered thoughts, with armes folded, heart sighing, and eies dropping, hee takes his way towards his Cabinet, at euery step cursing his fortune, and accusing the Nymph Ethera's counsell, as the ground of his vtter confusion; but he had not gone farre in his way, before he might behold the Nymph Apheleia , comming to encounter him; which apprehension when he had receiued, he presently forsakes his direct path, and turnes into a way, which to her way was most contrary; she (not imagining the notice he had taken) crosses his path, and had almost attain'd an encounter, but he instantly hunts another way, and so, like two running in a maze two contrary waies, they shunne and pursue, and being neerest, are furthest asunder; which needlesse and impertinent winding when the Nymph perceiued, and knew he had both beheld her person, and taken notice of her desire; yet like a wanton fire fled still from her presence, with a minde, easily apted to take any impression of iealousy, she stands still, and giues way to his fancy, of which her toubled minde makes diuers constructions; her feare showes her many strange beauties of which he might be inchanted; her seuerer iudgement cals to her consideration youths wanton vnstaydnesse, and reuoltes in affection; onely reason, which is euer the sworne friend to vertue, perswades her that against reason goodnesse will neuer runne into any disgracefull errour, and that this strangenesse in behauiour, might spring from the affaires of profite, and not from the coldnesse of affection; and with this imagination, being content to be satisfyed with an in-sufficient satisfaction, she returnes to her Cell; where it was hard to iudge, whether Iealousy, or Wisedome, had greater sway in her meditations. By this time, the night had clos'd vp the eie of the day, at what time, the Nymph Ethera hauing attired me in the forme she first found me, made her returne to the lodge of the Princesse; into whose presence when she was arriued, she found her so much ouer-come with all the torments of a troubled imagination; and so much pleased to yeeld to the worst euill that griefe or affliction would impose vpon her, as the Nymph infinitely repented the good she had done, seeing the accidents so euill which depended on the same; yet before she could open her mouth, either to comfort, or excuse, the Princesse said. O Ethera , he is false, indeed hee is false, nay hee is false beyond all the degrees of falshood, and then her gentle heart sent forth a volly of sighes, the least of which had bene able to batter the life of a much stronger constitution; but the subtile Nymph Ethera hauing called all her best of knowledges together, and finding a little detestation planted in the Princesse heart, to which she was most willing to giue a roote of perpetuall continuance, with well ordered words, she thus said vnto her. Madam, though affection be said to haue but one eie, which is euer applied to the obiect of his vertuous desire; yet is that eie so to be gouerned by the discretion of an vncontrouleable wisedome, that neither dishonour nor disparagement haue any dependance in our wils election; for if our passions shall transport vs not onely to loose our natiue freedome (a Iewell, for which the Romanes would giue their liues most freely) but also annex to that losse, a certaine incertainety of any felicity to accompany our liues. What madnesse shall remaine in our monuments? And what scorne shall dwell on our vnfollowed examples? chiefly where either fate, time, or iudgement, hath discouered the mischeife, hanging in Dionysius haire ouer vs: This, deere Lady, I speake to you, who knowing the worst of euils which can annoy your fortunes, haue the large liberty of free will to cleere any cloud which can oppose your sun-shine: You know Diatassan is false and inconstant, Thirsis true and immoueable; Diatassan hath his fancy clad in all colours, Thirsis faith hath but one roabe, and it is so purely white that it cannot be sullied; Diatassan loues onely himselfe and his owne delights, Thirsis none but Melidora , and her most renowned vertues; to conclude, Diatassan hath a seruice for euery seuerall beauty, Thirsis owes homage to none but one singular rarenesse. Now Madame, if this diuersity of goodnesse be betweene these persones, why should not an equall diuersity in fortunes follow their aduancements? It is things of like nature and quality which euer do best co-here and agree together, neuer shall wee see contraries in one subiect, then to auoid the imputations which in him you behold to be most hatefull, embrace the vertues of the other which are admired of all creatures: But you will say euery character in Diatassan both his outward and inward behauiours presents the figures of a noble descent: and what staine is there in Thirsis , which showes him not to be much more heroicall? Hee is a stranger in our walkes (though of longer continuance) as well as the other, and may, for any thing we can gaine say, draw his linage from the height of Deity; then sith they be both incertaine, why should not our opinions haue a charitable construction? as for the vertues of their mindes they hold no comparison, for Diatassan speaking much, oft marres it with curiosity; Thirsis speech, being euer confin'd to necessity, inchants his auditors with the admiration of his wisedome; as for their actiue vertues, either in games of force or mastery, or in sports of pleasure and actiuity, I need not say which is best, sith there was neuer equality in their doings; If then our wils do will things euer which are accounted best, and our natures apt to boast any thing which is most pretious; then (good Madam) cast not away the smal, round, orient Pearle, and preserue the shell, because it shines, and is much the larger. I pray thee, (said the Princesse, interrupting her discourse) for patience sake, make an end of thy bitternesse, thou dost but adde a drop of oile to an vnquenchable fire; I am resolu'd, and my vowes are gone vp to heauen, so that when mine eies shall vouchsafe him the imagination of a fauour, let them loose their seeing; and when my heart shall consent to any thing but a charitable pitty of his misfortunes, may it be as barren of good thoughts, as he is of loyalty. O but (said the Nymph) shall Thirsis receiue any merite, for his long endurances? Alas (said the Princesse) thou dost aske me vnreconcilable questions, I may as wel giue thee solution what counsels are held in the Parliament of the Gods, as tell thee what mittigation shall come to his sorrow. Why Madame (said the Nymph) haue you not free-will? Yes (said Melidora ) to thinke, but not to publish my thoughts; for sooner shall a thousand deaths, with a thousand seuerall torments, bring me to a disgracefull monument, then I wil either to the world discouer so much weakenesse as to change in a moment; or to make election of him, whom with such violence I haue so many yeares dispised; I will not brand my faith with that oblique, to possesse it with two obiects in one season, nor giue enuy that aduantage to imagine that mine alteration sprung from mine own ends; besides, my former scornes haue setled so much dispaire in the heart of Thirsis , that except I should grow neerely familiar with impudence, and my selfe discouer what my selfe would haue closest conceal'd; it is impossible that he should, once more, dare to attempt mee with the tender of his seruice. True Madame (quoth the Nymph) both this, and all the rest of your most worthy considerations, are excellent and vnrefellable; honour, like a bold champion, maintaining them against all Art, wit, or inchanting-oratory; yet Madame vnder the patience of your better resolutions, I can, from my braine, deliuer such a Stratageme, that you shall, by the hand of fate, be freed from the opportunities of Diatassan without any publicke shew of your owne distemperance, and enioy the seruice of Thirsis by a seeming constraint, against any desire or wish of your creation. The Princesse at these words, being drawne into a litle admire; yet, through her former acquaintance with her wisedome, in things of like nature, apted by an easie impression to giue beliefe to her protestation, with a negligent earnestnesse, she intreated her to discouer the deuice; giuing assurace, that if neither her honor, place, nor modesty might by the seuerity of iudgement be rackt to imputation, that she would giue full way and assistance to the vttermost of her proiect. Then Madame (quoth the Nymph) it is not vnknowne to your selfe, to vs, to Tempe ; nay, to all Thessalie , that no Sheepheard, Nymph, Satyr, or Fairy, for swiftnesse of foot, and true Art in each seuerall chase, for perfect skill in darting, and nimble vse of the Bow, is able to compare with your greatnesse; Diana , as it were, hauing giuen you her quiuer, and Apollo his bow, with which he triumphed ouer Python : onely Thirsis alone excepted, who in priuate exercise (though not in publique triumph) hath euer gone beyond you in those noble maisteries. Your excellence therefore shall cause it to be proclaimed through all Tempe , that in honour of our great Goddesse Minerua , you will, vpon the first day of this ensuing moneth, hold a solemne and most glorious festiuall; in which day you will haue the Tyger lodged and chased by all the Sheepheards, Forresters, and Groomes belonging to these Launds; and if any creature can either ouer-run you in the chase, or strike his dart in the Tyger before yours be fastened in his skin; he shall, for the glory of his conquest, enioy you for his perpetuall Mistresse; and you him, for an eternall seruant: And to stirre vp vertue (which many times sleepes in obscure creatures) you shall propose diuers other prizes to be bestowed of the best deseruers, that no merit may go vnsatisfied. When the Princesse had heard this deuice, and with a certaine silent amazement pondered in her consideration, the best and worst that might be deriued from the inuention, taking a full knowledge of the drift to which all the Nymphes perswasions tended, which was no way different from the aime of her owne most priuate wishes, with a well-setled demurenesse, which seemed to oppose what shee had propounded, she gaue her this answere; If I had nothing (deere Ethera ) to respect more then my person (which now is growne vnto it selfe of most vile estimation) I could then bee contented to embrace and prosecute thy counsell, and sell my selfe to a publique Mart, in hope that no man would esteeme me a Iewell worth the cheapning. But when mine honour (which hitherto I haue not blotted with any thing) appeares vnto me attended with modesty and reputation; then nothing can beare a more deformed Image, then this seeming vnwilling, yet most wilfull, giuing my selfe into the hands of fortune: for in it I publish to the world, I care not whom I haue, so one I haue; and that one, if it be the pleasure of Chance, may be full of all vnworthinesse, mine election being grounded neither vpon wisedome, loue, nor vertue, but vpon the nimblenesse of a deliuer foot, and a well-aiming hand, excellencies worthy our praises, but not our persons. Besides, what shall I be that day, more then a Sommer-games prize, a horses Race-bell, or a Grey-hounds collar? which howsoeuer wonne with expence, is yet neglected in the keeping. Wee may imagine much in our owne fortitudes, and strengthen our hopes with our Arts, but there is a power aboue, which so disdaineth this temptation, that he often turnes them retrograde to our wils, and makes them our scales to affliction; yet forasmuch as from the schoole of thy wisedome I haue receiued many infinite satisfactions; and haue not seen any, but most prosperous starres to accompany thy proceedings, I am contented wholly to be gouerned by thee, beseeching thee, by the loue thou bearest to immaculate chastity, and as thou wilt answere my disgrace, both before the world, and the great Goddesse whom we serue, so to direct all these aimes and resolutions into which thou intendest to ingage me, that I may, with a golden thrid of vnfoiled honour, passe through any laborynth which in my fortunes course shall oppose me: For be assured, whensoeuer I shall finde any imaginary scandall to intrude on my vertue, it shall be the last hower of my breath and continuance. And here she paused, with an earnest fix vpon the eyes of the Nymph, who taking her by the delicate hand, and kissing it, intreated her highnesse to be confident in her carefulnesse, vowing vpon herselfe a death most violent, when any of her proiects should hazard her disparagement; and from these protestations it was concluded, that the proclamation in selfe- same-forme as she had formerly deliuered it, should forth-with bee proclaimed through all Tempe ; and likewise sent into Arcadia , with safe conduct to all Sheepheards, and Forresters which would try their fortunes; but with great penalties of strange deaths to any that should appeare and be found of better ranke or quality. And this was no sooner resolued, but it was put in execution by the iolly Nymph; who hauing commission from the Princesse, made euery seuerall Officer, both Sheepheard and Woodman, in their seuerall walkes, proclaime the same with great state & solemnity; so that there was not an eare in Tempe , which had not receiued the sound thereof: onely Diatassan , whom care and shame, or a carefull shamefastnesse, had all this while imprisoned in his Cabinet, where he lay tormenting and afflicting himselfe with all the calamities of a disturbed and a perplexed minde, receiued this newes, but by an incertaine secundary report, and that with such imperfect and contrary relations, as the truth thereof could finde no setled place in his vnderstanding: so that desirous to know what rumour said euery one knew, he rises from his wearied couch (which he had pressed as much with his woes as his owne burden) and walkes forth with steppes heauy and slow (sutable to his sad soule) into the next neighbouring fields, and there, with much search, at last he found out his onely best of friends, the discreet yong Sheepheard Melio ; one in whose bosome he had euer inclosed the richest secrets of his loue; and in whose counsels he had found such sweet contentment, being euer directious to prosperous fortunes, that no commerce was so pretious or welcome vnto him, as the enioyment of his company. As soone as they were met together, and had discharged vpon each other, whole vollies of loue, in most respectiue complements, their caressings being mixed with many embracements, in the end Diatassan enquired of Melio the tenor of those proclamations which in a doubtfull maner had but as yet touched his eares; and Melio from poynt to point declared the whole substance of the same, relating the solemnity of the ceremonies in the performance thereof, and the seuerity of euery Officers charge not to neglect or foreslow his best diligence in the publication thereof. Then Diatassan demanded, if this were done by the consent of the Princesse, and he was answered, that all things were performed by her most especiall commission. Then he enquired who should be iudge if any doubtfull controuersie should arise; and the Sheepheard told him onely the faire Nymph Apheleia . Thus when he had receiued euery certainty and circumstance, and had with his disturbed thoughts drawn into a serious consideration the ends of these vnaccustomed proiects; his heart, as if it would haue split in sunder, began to ouer-grow his dwelling-place; and had not many throbbing sighes, vttered with huge painfulnesse, a little abated the swelling, he had there falne downe dead at his amazed friends foot. But tyrannous sorrow, vnwilling he should so soone shake hands with his misery, being Mistres of all his sences, made them extend their powers, and bring back reason and remembrance to their former mansions, whilst the sheepheard, with armes crossed, and fould about his bosome, said to his friend; Ha Melio ! I haue already numbred all my dayes of delight, and now see nothing but sorrow and calamity before me, with whom I must walke to an early, and despised graue; and it is good reason I do so, sith I am a wretch, whom all vertue and goodnesse hath forsaken. Melio , amazed to heare these words proceeding fro him, whom he had euer taken to be Fortunes chiefest Minion, said; Doth not too great aboundance of happinesse (my deere Sheepheard) make thee complaine of pouerty in blessednesse? If it do, beware; for thou mayst by such ingratitude, draw vpon thee the displeasure of the Gods; chiefely when they see their great fauours vnthankfully neglected: What canst thou wish which thou doest not enioy? Thou hast fruitfull walkes, couered with more fruitfull Cattell, whose increase and profit makes thee liue more in the rich mans enuy, then need. Thou hast the loue of thy neighbours, and admiration of strangers: Thou hast no want, if not in an immeasurable wish; nor no store which may make ambition lay plots for thy ouerthrow: aboue all, and which is such a superlatiue height aboue all happinesse, thou hast the only grace and fauour of the most great, most vertuous, and most admired Princesse of the world. O say not so (said Diatassan ) but say I am despised, forlorne, and in the highest measure disdained of the onely best, and most compleatest in perfection, that euer Nature brought forth, or the earth inioyeth. Ha my Melio! when hath thy iudgment (which was my Tutor to all happinesse) been so darke in its vnderstanding, that it should say, it doth not behold the brightnesse of sun-shine? Alasse (deere friend) my cloudy sorrowes do behold the drift of the Princesse in her serious proclamation; to me it is known, (though to others, peraduenture, concealed) that of all the Sheepheards either in Tempe , or in Arcadia , there is none, either for lightnesse of foot, or skilfull hand in deliuering her dart, able to compare with the Princesse, Thirsis onely excepted; who in many priuate tryals I haue seene rarely exceed her: so that in as much as once for my sake she did dispise him, now for my disgrace, she will, out of a will, seeming most vnwilling, onely entertaine him. If that (quoth Melio ) be the end of her stratagem, she will finde herselfe infinitely deceiued in her purpose: For Thirsis (alacke for pitty) is fast enough, and neither can come to try his fortunes in her Conquest, nor giue the least blow of despaire to thy wishes. Alasse! (said Diatassan ) what fortune is befalne to that good swaine? Why, haue you not heard (said Melio ) of Mysantropos the great Magitian? he that in the vale, which for his sake is entitled Miserable, hath erected an inchanted house of an immeasurable circumference, in which he holds in prison, with torments most vnspeakeable, all that euer set their feet within his charmes; especially louers, whose howling lamentations hee vowes to exceed all musicke whatsoeuer. Yes (said Diatassan ) I haue heard of him oft, and haue from a farre beheld his tyrannous mansion. But what of him (good Sheepheard) I pray thee? Why this (said Melio ) As the poore afflicted, and most miserable Thirsis went wandring vp  & downe the woods, casting forth vnto the ecchoing rockes, the grieuous accents of vnsupportable calamities, striuing to make insensible things sensible of his anguish, with a carelesnesse discending from a care too carefully employed, and forgetting all things but his woes, which were euer awake in his bosome, all vnawares he fell within the vnloosable bonds of the Magitians most diuellish coniurations, & now remaines a slaue to those torments, which we may imagin, but not comprehend in the compasse of any imagination, to the generall griefe of all swaines, and the vtter subuersion of all pastorall delights whatsoeuer. Yet (said Diatassan ) doth not his imprisonment giue my hopes any comfort; for sith none but he alone can win her, none but he alone shall triumph in her victory. Yes (said Melio ) Fortunes wheele hath many ioints, and euery ioint hath a seuerall winding; therefore this once let thy will be directed by my counsell; I know the insufferable and vnspeakeable torments which the euer-to-be- pittied- Thirsis indureth, are so much beyond the strength of mans sufferance, that the onely way to binde him to thee in a chaine of eternall  & euerlasting friendship, and to make his feruice a dutifull tribute to thy pleasure, is to procure him new liberty, and to shake his heart-root sorrows from his macerated bosome. O my Melio (said Diatassan ) didst thou not heare the late mischance of infortunate Moelibeus , who going the other day to cary fodder to his flocks, who hunger had almost starued, as the carefull sheepheard began with his foot to rake away the snow, that hee might, with lesse losse, lay their food on the earth, he chanst to find a snake halfe dead,  & halfe aliue; at which, the tender-harted sheepheard being assailed with much pirty, to behold the gasps which the grieued creature gaue, being by the violece of the cold brought to the last moment of destruction, he took it vp, & with his warme hand put it into his warmer bosome, thence brought it home, and with gentle strokings gently bath'd it before the fire; but when the warmth had thaw'd the frosty sence of the sicke creature, and brought backe that life which was almost vtterly fled for euer; the ingratefull Snake forgetfull of all goodnesse, how carefully soeuer bestowed, stung the poore Sheepheard as he plai'd with it; euen so, if by mine industry I should giue new life and liberty to the desolate Thirsis , I feare, that loue would bring that forgetfulnesse into his minde, which would soone bring a subuersion to me and my fortunes. Fie, (said Melio ) how doth feare sully, thy most generous and noble nature, making thee iealous of the most compleate goodnesse, It tell thee, Thirsis , stood a thousand deaths before him, would cast himselfe head-long amongst them, ere his thankefull nature should be blemisht with ingratitude; hee is the modell on which Nature lookes when shee makes any thing excellent, but not being able to giue euery part his perfection; for anger, she throwes her works rudely into the world, whence it comes, that many haue perticular good qualities, but none compleate to bee compared with Thirsis , Therefore, let my knowledge of his vertue bee thy fortresse against suspition. Then (said Diatassan ) what shall I do when I haue deliuered him from the danger of his bondage? Thou shalt (replyed the Sheepheard) with all the priuacy that night or wisedome can containe, conuey him home to thine owne Cabinet, and there containe him with all care and contentment till the day of triumph, at which time, thou shalt adorne him in all thine owne furniture, and according to thy custome arme him in these light peeces, which thou hast vsually worne in the like masteries, wherby his face being concealed, none shall bee able to accuse his policy; which done, thou shalt keepe close, and send him forth as thy person, fame hauing formerly blaz'd to the world, that the loyalty of thy loue hath moued thee that day to try thy fortune with the Princesse. Now when Thirsis hath accomplisht all that thou canst wish, and brauely, vnder thy shadow, made himselfe most victorious, he shall returne againe to thy lodge, and possessing thee with thy owne habite, thou shalt come forth, and challenge the benefit of the Proclamation. Diatassan hearing this deuise (which bred infinite contentment in his minde) was, nowithstanding, so fearefully doubtfull of euery feare which might bee annexed to the danger of these passages; that once more hee demanded of his friend, if hee could, by any possibility, bee perswaded that Thirsis would proue iust in this action, who againe, with many violent reiterations gaue him assurance that Thirsis hate was as great to ingratitude as vnto damnation: But then Diatassan told him, how deerely Thirsis loued the Princesse, the violence of which affection hee fear'd, would breake all the lawes of nature, friendship, vowes, or gratefulnesse. Melio halfe angry to see the strength of his infidelity, told him that he must either beleeue, or let his mis-beliefe beare him to ruine, for quoth he) you must either win her by him, or by your owne vertue; in your selfe there is no hope, in him there is certaine assurance; then, sith your owne will must make your owne choice, do what you list, for I shall be pleased with any election. Diatassan , loath to giue distast to him, whose aduise had euer directed him in his best actions, after many excuses for the doubtfulnesse of his beliefe, with assurance to pursue, with all earnestnesse, the vttermost of his directions, besought him to instruct him by what meanes he might compasse the liberty of the most desolate sheepheard. To which Melio replying, demanded of him, if he knew not Elpino the most famous musycall sheepheard? And he answered him, that he knew him well: Why then (said Melio ) Know that Titerus , the great Mayster of all Pastorall Melody; who amongst the cunning Sheepheards was made euen diuine for his knowledges, hauing taken more instructions from Apollo then the God of Sheepheards, he, when he died, gaue his pipe vnto Elpino , whom with much tendernesse he loued aboue all the Swaines in Arcadia , and taking his leaue of him, before death had made him take his last leaue of the world; he with painefull care taught him all the worthy secrets which belonged thereunto, instructing his fingers diuers waies how to touch it for diuers vertuous purposes; amongst the rest, he told the Sheepheard, how that Pipe was giuen vnto him by the great God Pan , and was composed of that Reede, into which faire Syrinx (whom he loued) was by his Diety conuerted, whence it springs, that it doth, and shall for euer retaine this vertue; By the onely sounding thereof the force of all magicke and inchantment shall cease, the gates of hell it is able to vnloose, and will make that rocke dance in the hands of destiny; by this alone (quoth he) I haue deliuered many distressed Sheepheards from the tyranous inquisition-house of the neuer satisfied Mysantropos , Now then my Sheepheard, seeke out Elpyno , and by thy suite, and thankefull offertories procure him to worke this euer to be praised enlargement. Diatassan gaue him a world of thankes for his counsels, and then kissing his cheeke, he assured him that hee would put the hazard of all his fortunes vpon the hope of Thirsis vertue; and so they departed, Melio to his Flockes, whom the calme warme weather made to straggle on the mountaines, and Diatassan to seeke out Elpyno , from whom he had hope to compasse the first part of his wishes. Rumour, which like a Citty watch-bell, is euer tugling vpon the least occasion, had by this time sounded through all Tempe the alarum of Thirsis misfortune; so that the repetion thereof comming to the eares of the Princesse, she beganne to entertaine a new griefe more sharpe and peircing then any where-with shee had bene formerly acquainted, for till now, she neuer would suffer her heart to know how excellent and perfite he was in euery goodnesse. This griefe, when she saw it would perforce conquer her best temperance; with all secresy she issues from her Lodge, and went vnto the Cell of the Nymph Ethera , whom she found busily employed about the affaires of the day triumphant; and making her desist from her labour, after many sighes, which blew vp some showers of small teares, she reported vnto her the most miserable misfortune and lamentable mischance, which was befalne the poore starre-crost Thirsis , in such large and ample manner as her eares had formerly receiued it, saying. O my Ethera , how is there now any hope left, either to bring thy purposes to passe, or to grant to my minde any honourable satisfaction? What end now will issue of thine inuention, more then an airy nothing? Mine honour lying prostitute to the hazard of euery vnworthy desteny, whilst vertue it selfe liues in bondage vnder the tyranous hand of euer-liuing-torments. Ethera taking into her eares this strange sound of Thirsis misery, whose despaire brought a generall despaire to al her purposes whatsoeuer; was so amazedly strucken with a silent wonder, and so oppressed with griefe to behold the preuention of her vertuous designes, that her sences, ready to forsake the seate of her vnderstanding, had almost made her fall downe in a swound, at the foote of the Princesse; but consideration, strengthned by wisedome, calling them backe to their true offices, and instructing her mind that the example of her griefe, might bring to the Princesse, a despaire, troublesomely vnmoueable, with a countenance much contrary to her thoughts, and smiling, when the teares were ready to leape from her eyes, she said. Madam, the bond of charity, which is the rule that swayeth euery worthy minde vnto pitty; if there were no other tie to make me commisserate his fortunes, is sufficient to stir in me a griefe some-what more potent then euery ordinary distemperature, and so much the rather in that I know the afflictions which he indureth (vnder that monster of liuing creatures, the neuer-enough-tormenting Mysantropos ) are greater then may passe vnder the title of greatest calamity; yet, that this should either bring despaire to our present action, or make me repent my purpose, into which I haue with all willingnesse imbarked my reputation, there is neither reason to imagine, nor wisedome to defend; for this most haplesse misaduenture, shall bring better garments to our designe, and strengthen our desire with that assurance, which your former disdaine, and his obedient carefulnesse might else haue made doubtfull. Thou hast a minde (said the Princesse) like the Lernian monsters heads, for when thou hast one hope taken from thee, their springs two better in the place to defend thy vndertakings; yet, I pray thee beware of this Hercules , despaire, least in the end hee make our ruine his conquest. Feare not, Madam, (said the Nymph) for if your confidence will but suite with my care, no occurrent shall go amisse which is any thing allyed to the proiect wee follow; And therefore briefly thus, you shall giue liberty to the distressed Swaine, and in despight of hell, and the snares of entangling night-spels, you shall deliuer him from that wretchednes, which euen wretchednes it selfe, is not able to imitate; A worke, wherein you shall not onely gaine from men an honourable commendations, but also pay that great debt of thankefulnesse with a large interest, which whilst it is vnsatisfied cloaths you with an neglect, much like to ingratitude; For Lady, he once, not onely saued your life, but your honour, a Iewell, whose losse no breath can counteruaile. I vnderstand your desire (said Melidora ,) but I vnderstand not the meanes to effect it; for it sufficeth not to say, thus I shall do, but thus I must do. And then the Nymph deliuered to her, at large, the manner how to procure his liberty, inciting her to go to the Temple of Minerua , where she should finde the worthy Nymph Nerina , whose office was to beare the holy Speare of the martiall Goddesse, being a virgine of such exquisite perfection, that the Goddesse Pallas had giuen vnto her more rare giftes then to all other Nymphs attending her Diety, amongst which she had the power of vnloosing charmes, and breaking insunder the strongest linkes, where-with the Art of Magicke had power to bind any creature. To this Nymph therefore, with all speed, the Princesse (attended onely by the Nymph Ethera ) made her repaire; and finding her reposing in an arbor of Eglantine, adioyning to the wals of the Temple (hauing newly finished the ceremonies of the Goddesse) with a sober and demure looke, which did rather figure grauity then anguish, the Princesse thus spake vnto her. Most excellent and diuine hand-maid to our great Goddesse, to whom vertue hath not onely giuen an especiall prerogatiue, to make thee admired aboue all thy companions, but also setled thy renowne so deepely in the booke of memory, that when time shall loose both his sythe & authority, yet the knowledge of thy goodnesse shall flourish most rarely; vouchsafe, I beseech thee, from that mercy which thou hast euer extended to miserable creatures, to grant me a request, which howsoeuer it may beget thy trouble, yet shall it make thy name to bee more and more worthily adored. Nerina , noting the earnestnesse of the Princesse, whom shee had neuer before knowne acquainted with like solicitings, entreated her Highnesse to discharge from her brest the weight of her desire, and shee would assure her, that what vertue soeuer remained in her power, should both bee commanded and employed by her; then, said the Princesse. Most sacred Maide, it is not vnknowne vnto all Thessaly , and much more vnto Tempe , and these holy walkes; that when the cruell and blasphemous Demagoras , (the onely prophaner of our Rites, and disturber of the quietnesse we should possesse) had with a tyranous polluted hand ceazd on my person, with an entent to make it a prey both for his lust and fury, mine honour glutting the one, and my life the other, euen in that instant, when there was nothing but dispaire betweene me  & my confusion, the Noble-minded Thirsis , with an actiue resolution, far beyond his birth and profession; not onely deliuered mee from shame and danger, or the dangerous shame of a foule stayned destruction; but also brought mee to that safety, which gaue assurance to my minde, that all mine euils were banished from me: this benefite, as yet, I haue requited with nothing but disdaine and disacknowledging strangenesse; merits as much contrary to his deserts, as my neglect was contrary to a thankfull nature; which want, Fortune pittying in me, she hath now administred an occasion, whereby I may satisfie my great debt, and giue vnto the world a better satisfaction; for Thirsis is now a tormented prisoner in the inchanted Castle of the most cruell Mysantropos ; from whence, if by thy meanes, I may procure his liberty, thou shalt not only binde me in euerlasting loue-knots to be thy perpetuall admirer, but for euer possesse me as thine owne purchast creature. The Nymph drawing into her consideration both the reasonablenesse and worthinesse of Melidora's intreaty, made her this reply; Madame, there cannot be a more vertuous action, then the gratefull requitall of those benefites by which our liues and honors are preserued: nor can deformity couer our memories with a more viler sepulcher then the neglect of that duty we owe to our benefactors; And hence it springs that you desire to restore him from the torments of Mysantropos , which freed you from the lust of Demagoras . But is your highnesse sure he is within that den of the vnmercifull Magitian? Am I sure (said the Princesse?) Alasse for comfort! I am much too sure: for diuers of the discreetest Sheepheards of our walkes being set vpon the tops of the mountaines, from whose aspiring heads they might behold the least secret obscurity in all the vallyes, saw how the forlorne and selfe-neglecting Sheepheard, wandred all carelesse vp and downe, neither fearing the sauage cruelty of deuouring beasts, nor the hidden dangers which might lurke in those most vnhaunted pathes of desolation: In the end, when hee drew neere to the inchanted valley, whose verdure and counterfeit spring is able to entice a sence of the best iudgement, with shouts, clamours, and exclamations they gaue him warning of the peril into which he was falling, through the force of his melancholy: but he, like a constant Sheepheard, whose life-bloud ran not within his owne veines, and the Organ of whose motion was ruled by a much higher mouer, neither heard, nor regarded, because in himselfe he had no regard of hearing; and so, to the amazement, and euen madde griefe of all his companions, he fell into that misery, whence, but by your helpe, there is no hope of releasement. Madame (said Nerina ) although I know it is a worke of an impossible creation to execute the rule of the most wholesome counsell, when it struggles against, not onely the knowledge of our outward sences, but also holds a continuall combat both against the hope and maine ends of our affection; yet I beseech you in this designe, let neither your minde be gouerned by your eye, nor let the affection you beare to the comfortlesse Swaine, for the tribute of his former seruices, so much ouer-sway you, that by the directions of an vnskilfull imagination, you bring both him and your selfe to a certaine destruction; but as you loue to enioy the ioyfull end of your purpose, so in all things follow mine instructions, and they shall make you with safety arriue to the blest hauen of your wishes. Melidora being heart-charmed with her perswasions, assured her that she would sooner fall into the hands of death, then faile in the least circumstance of her slieghtest commandement; vowing that till this needfull businesse were performed; neither her body nor minde should looke with any other eies, then such as had onely their light from her directions. Vpon this faithfull protestation, Nerina tooke the Speare belonging to the great Goddesse Minerua , against whose point no proofe was able to resist and deliuered it into the white hand of the Princesse, commanding her, that neither for life nor death, she should suffer it to depart out of the same; For said the Nymph, it shall preserue you against all those eare-inchanting sounds where-with the Magician will seeme to rauish and distract you, and will so keepe your best knowledges in their accustomed seates, that no forgetfulnesse shall surprise or hinder your determinations: When your are come into the infortunate Valley, the sonne of darkenesse and mischance, accurst Mysantropos , will, by his great Nygromanticke skill so change and vnfigure his owne shape, and with such absolute perfection take vpon him all the shapes and dimensions of miserable Thirsis , that if you will giue credite to your eies, (who in that moment will be your onely enemies) your minde will not bee perswaded it can bee any other creature, then the Swayne you onely seeke to preserue, but putting all trust from your eies, and immaginary fancies, how faithfull seruants soeuer they haue bene to you in former times; step boldly vnto that false shape, and with this Speare strike him vnto the heart; and although, I know, that many agonies will stir vp many argumentes in your brest, forbidding you to kill whom you couet onely to saue, yet in that extremity banish all such motions, and the more you are moued to pitty, stirke with so much the more fury; and, beleeue me, as I am faithfull to the Goddesse whom I serue, so assuredly you shall slay the Monster Mysantropos , and set your perplexed Sheepheard at perfite liberty: This is the substance of all your charge, and this is the onely meanes for his deliuerance: good Lady, print it deepe in your memory, bee valiant, carefull, but not too-selfe-trusting. To this speech, when the Princesse had engaged her best attention, and had euen printed in her soule each tittle of her charge, she promised the Nymph that al her words should be so carefully obeyed, that, compassing her desire, she would make all the world ring with her praises, and so taking their leaues with many ceremonious embracements, they departed, one from the other, Nerina into Minerua's Temple, and the Princesse with the Nymph Ethera to seeke out the infortunate Vally; which, like euery euill, was most easie to bee found, for the pathes which lead thereunto, were leuell, smoth, soft, and full of all manner of eie-delightfulnesse; The way, though much troden, was euer greene, being bordered on each side with all manner of flowers, whom Winter neuer toucht, but flourished farre beyond the works of best industry; onely they were full of pollution when they were handled, and noysome to smell to when indiscretion had gathered them: When they were come to the verge of the vnlucky Dale, for they might easily know it by many characters which they had receiued, the Princesse tooke her leaue of the Nymph Ethera , (for there was no stepping her vndefended foote into that most certaine place of intollerable danger) yet before the Nymph would suffer her to depart, falling vpon her knees before her, shee most humbly besought her by all those vertuous coniurations which familiar intimacy begetteth in louing hearts; as by the great honor of her vnmatchable virginity, by the pleasure of her Bow, and her imitations of Diana , by her delight in the Pastorall life, and by those Eglogs, which, in her discourses, she had oft with great contentment rehearsed; that she would by no meanes forget the instructions of the Nymph, but either with resolution (as firme as her vowes of chastity) execute the vttermost of them, to the least haire, or tittle of their deliniation; or otherwise, if she found any faynting motion, or retractiue humour in her doubtfull spirit, to desist and proceede no further; for, it was, questionlesse, that vpon her least remissenesse there might spring danger to her person. The Princesse, willing (had not her will better gouerned her) to haue bene angry with the Nymphs distrust of her resolution, told her, shee should not need to inchant her with any coniuration, for shee was neuer composed of such a weake inconstant humour, as to engage her selfe in so worthy an affaire, and then to let it faile through the feeblenesse of a little selfe-beleefe, then which, there was nothing more vaine or imperfect. And so embracing the Nymph, and binding her not to hold a more vnworthy opinion of her discretion, then hitherto her actions had giuen liberty, with a world of vnspeakeable kindnesse participated in each of their complements, they departed the one from the other; the Nymph to her Cell, and the Princesse into the infortunate Valley: Vpon whose Turfes, she could hardly say, she had well troden; when on euery side, she was inuironed with all the delights that euer the open aire could boast of; the ground whereon shee trod appearing like needle-worke, carpets checkered and imbosted with flowers of such various, yet well mixt collours, that Art and Nature seemed to haue bene most especiall friends in that peece of worke-man-ship; The melodious Birds, seated vpon faire Cycamore-trees, (whose shadowy leaues were defences against the Sunne- shine) vttered their tunes with such cheerefull alacrity, that it was impossible for any humaine minde to heare them without destraction, the murmuring Brookes playing vpon the pretty Peebles, mixt with golden sand, sent forth such a silent minstrelcy, that the water-Nymphs appeared aboue the bankes, weauing most curious Coronets of Sedge, Poppey, and Water-lillies, where-with they offered to crowne the head of euery wandring-passenger; by the Bankes of the siluer streames lay the Lyon, the Panther, the Wolfe, and the Leopard, all with such a friendly community without any emulation, that it seemed, like the first of Gardens, full of nothing but peace and delightfulnesse; vpon the Medowes trouled the light Hart, the nymble Bucke, and the fleete Roe, which in their coursing, and re-coursing so plaid about the Princesse, that had not her memory bene an excellent Tutor, shee would not haue forborne from throwing the Speare amongst them. Thus, as shee traced along the path, which lead to the inchanted Castle, wondring at nothing, but that her wonder was no more increased; she came to that wood, wherein the hellish Cittadell was placed, and coueting with more speedy steps to free her selfe from that obscurity, shee might behold many fearefull and hideous obiects, which obseruing the motion of her eies, tooke, as it were, delight to liue euer offending her sight: There might she see Furies teares Snakes from their heads, and throwing them at the bosomes of afflicted people; and in another place, woefull louers scourged and tormented with lashes of fire, whose flames could neuer bee extinguished; Now would many-headed-monsters striue to impeach her in her further passage, and then presently would most hideous acclamations seeke to diuert her steps into other corners: But the Princesse, fortefyed with her confidence in the holy Speare, kept on her way without all amazement, for she saw that whatsoeuer she did see were but illusiue sights, most meerely imaginary and insubstantiall; By this time she was gotten through the darke Wood, and was now arriued in a most delicate little plaine, in the midst whereof stood the inchanted house, on whose stately Pinacles and strange Architecture whilst with hungry eies she gazed, she supposed that no Art nor wealth had power to effect a worke of such rarenesse; no Masons but Iewellers, hauing bene worke-men in the same, for neuer was their curious inameled Ingot hung in the haires of faire Ladies, which could present the luster of artificiall perfection, so amply, as the worst, and least-respected part of this building; but she had not gaz'd so long vpon this infernall worke that iudgement could say she had taken a full veiw of the same, when presently her eares were taken vp with such a strange sound of well-mixed musicke, that as if the Spheares had compast her about with their tunes; or the aire had bene nothing but a reporter of the rauishing songs of well pleased Angels, she was so amazedly distraught with delight, that had she bene without her holy defensitiue, she had there perisht in her admiration; many times would she cast her eies about, to see if shee could take knowledge from what Coast that Harmony proceeded, but she perceiued it still to be so generall; that like the Citty of Thebes , shee supposed all that earth to haue his foundation vpon Musicke; and as her immaginations were thus talking to her fancies, vpon the suddaine she might see comming towards her the cruell Nygromancer; so like in euery shape, feature, speech, and gesture, to the most miserable Thirsis , that no sence, how curious soeuer, was able to distinguish any difference betweene them; he came, as it seemed, led, inchained, and tormented by many sauage Furies, his vnpitying executioners, who in midst of his vexations seemed scornefully to make themselues partners of his laments. And now being come so neere, that her eies might iudge the difference betwixt their iniuries and his wordes, she might perceiue that he sung vnto her these Stanza's following; with rear'd vp hands, deiected eies, humble countenance; and all the gestures of a despairefull soule; that pitty, by the assistance of such aide, was able to conquer the most adamantine brest of the cruellest flint-hearted.  Lady draw neere, O let the golden fire Which giues so great a glory to your face, Resolue, in time, the frost of my desire, And giue me light to put my clouds to chace: Lady, deere Lady, best Lady pitty mee, Because I plaine, perish and pine for thee. Like to the Bird which tries her tender plumes, Before she venture on too great a flight I follow you, but when my soule presumes To mount, it fals againe through want of might: Deere Melidora , worlds-ioy, pitty mee, Because I plaine, perish and dye for thee. Euen in the very midst of these Stanza's, and when the words had imperfectly scarfe knit them and the sence together, the Princesse charged her Speare against his brest, and was ready to deliuer that blow which might haue giuen an end to her feare; when the counterfeit cruell one, throwing open his armes, as if with greedinesse he would swallow the death she threatned, and there-with-all vsing those actions which any way could stirre commisseration, he not onely made her desist from her threatning; but also moued such arguments to arise in her perplexed brest, that her eie, hauing made her will her slaue, she beginnes to hold strong disputation against all her instructions. Can it be possible (said she) that this is not Thirsis , whom I see with so much humility stand before me? Can Nature, which hath made all the world so different one from an other, bee growne now so cunning, that he and this should haue but one Idea ? O it cannot be, neither is it reason that mine eies, which haue euer bene faithfull vnto mee, should, in so vndoubtfull an obiect, receiue the imputation of distrust: Is there a ligne, a feature, or the smallest crest in all the volume of his countenance which I haue formerly beheld, and cannot now demonstrate? Alas, there is not one, neither is deceit so curious to be so carefull in her counterfeits: The Stales we make to entice, resemble much, but are alike little; for Art hath euer had a grosser hand then Nature; and so in this worke, if it were Sophisticate, there is no question, but the test of a pure iudgement would both decide  & discouer it. Foole that I am, whether am I carried? Is this the strength of my resolution, or the faith of my promise? haue I for this encampt my self amongst an army of perils, and left all mine honour to grosse Pl aebeian construction? and shall I now stand to dispute, and make Destiny doubtfull: who knowes not, that the eie of all sences, is most deceiuable? witnesse Ixion , that in steed of Iuno imbrast a Cloud; Alcmena for Amphitrian foulded Iupiter Hammon ; and Dido in steed of Ascanius , plaid with Cupyd her destroyer, Shall I then make doubt what this Monster is? I will not, I will not, and heere charging her Speare againe, with a better resolution then before, and being euen ready to deliuer it into his bosome; he with the wofulnesse of his countenance, and the sad actions, where-with in his song he vttered these Stanzaes following, made her againe refraine from the violence of her anger.  Deere, your vnkindnesse kills my my heart, Yet doth my death not grieue my thought, But being authour of my smart By you my murder shall be wrought: Nor doth my paine so discontent me, As your owne errour doth torment me. O may thy choice most prosperous bee, When thou shalt yeeld thy power to loue, And may no chang'd-faith let thee see, Th'eternall torments which I proue: Liue happy euer, none more blest, Though I forlorne, die with vnrest. These Stanzaes he deliuered with such an excellent voyce, and so rauishing a gesture of all despairefull actions, that not cruelty it selfe could haue had the power to haue wounded a soule so suppliant to any torment it would please beauty to inflict vpon him; and now the weakenesse of her imagination did so wonderfully transport her beyond all the rules of wholesome counsell, that not content to beleeue the falshoods of her eies, shee begets in her selfe diuers reasons and testimonies to approue what soeuer she suggest, saying; that al-be her sight might deceiue her, yet her eares could not, for she was assured that both the voyce and song could proceed from none but onely Thirsis , her knowledge being no such stranger, to his words, but that she could easily distinguish his aires from any counterfeite Musicke; and from hence, the strength of her opinion got so large an empire to gouerne ouer, that now she imagines the vertuous Nerina (subborned by Diatassan ) had onely drawne her into this laborinth, that murthering the most faithfull man of the world, there might no more doubts runne betweene him and his wishes; 'Tis so, (said she) alas, 'tis so, vertue hath euer bene hated, and malice cares not in how great an ocean of bloud it sailes to the designe it desireth, but mine innocent hands shall be free from such massacre, nor shall mine Epytaph be poluted with bloudy charracters; and as she was thus speaking, the Furies beganne rigorously to hale him from her presence; so that now her minde, being all repleate with loue and pitty, shee humbly besought them not to retire and carry goodnesse to misery; but euen for pitty sake, which forc't Pluto to lament with Orpheus , to giue to his last howers some tast of contentment, the progresse of whose life had trauelled through nothing but sorrow and vnsatisfied calamity, But the more she entreated, with the more violence they seemed to dragge him away; the image of Thirsis turning his head backe ouer his shoulder vpon her, and lifting vp his hands, in his woes seeming still to respect no affliction but the torment of her disdaine; which the more she beheld, the more her pitty encreased, and that pitty brought forth a desire, whose passion was so immoderate, that it was no errour to say it was plaine madnesse; and now casting the Speare out of her hand, she runnes after the Furies, and entreates them that she might speake with Thirsis , but one word, on little little word, when immediately, the Inchanter, transform'd to the ouglinesse of his owne shape, like a deuoring Wolfe o're an innocent Lambe, ceaz'd the distressed Lady, within his vnmercifull embracement, and turning ouer her like an euer-vnsatisfied vulture (for the losse of her Speare, had lost her all safety and comfort) hee said: Neuer till now, was I rich in my mischiefes, nor hath the tyde of mine euils before risen to a height equall with my wishes; but being now possest of Thirsis , the wonder of men, and Melidora , the admiration of woemen, what mischiefe can say it hath dominion ouer more singular people? O I shall grow fat with contentment, to heare their shrikes and lamentations, for their can be no Musicke so pleasing as the moanes of mortall creatures: And as he was thus speaking, with the distressed Lady in his armes, whose fearefull amazement had euen brought her to a sencelesse dumbnesse, hee might behold, appearing out of the Wood, Diatassan , and the Sheepheard Elpyno ; at which prospect hee, immediately, hurried the Princesse into his inchanted house, and vowed he would make such prouision, that the rest should not be long e're they bore her company; but scarcely had he, with his spels, clos'd vp his Nygromanticke gates, when the two Sheepheards Diatassan and Elpyno arriued before the same; on which, when they had, with wondring eies, gaz'd a pretty space, and meruailed that so much euill should bring forth so much excellency, Diatassan , in the end, telling Elpino , that within the bowels of that gawdy Monument were entombed all the miseries which euer were created, the burthen whereof lay so intollerably heauy vpon the soule of distressed Thirsis , as without some speedy ransome, it was impossible hee could continue vnconfounded, and therefore with all earenestnesse besought him to assay the vertue of his Pipe; to which Elpyno , more for the loue he bare to Thirsis , then for any other obligation whatsoeuer, most willingly consented; and so ordering his Reeds with the touch of a most delicate hand, hee there sounded forth such Musick, that the inchanted house did seeme to dance  & caper in the aire, the trembling Pinacles, so fearefully shaking their lofty heads, that they threatned a present ruine to the whole building; and now the inchanted gates flew open of their owne accord; whilst, as being borne away by some whirle-wind, issued forth the Princesse Melidora , and passed out of their sights with such a deliuer swiftnesse, that their eies could not giue their hearts certaine intelligence whether it was she or no; yet Diatassan , vpon her first appearance, intreated Elpyno a little to cease his Musicke, for if his eies were not too vniust Herralds, he saw the Princesse Melidora , but so soone was she vanisht from the leuell of their iudgements, that they stood in an amazed argument, whether it should be shee, or some illusion in her figure, to entice them from the designe they had vowed to prosecute; But when the doubt of their immagination was ended (for it was but a shadowy passion of short continuance) Diatassan againe entreated Elpyno to try his cunning, which he did with such curious painefulnesse that had hell it selfe bene in that place, the gates thereof must perforce haue flowne open; and now the Towers, which before did but tremble, began to fall from their foundations, yet before they were seene to touch the ground they vanisht like smoake, and resolued to nothing: During which disorderly ruine, Thirsis , like a man carried contrary to his owne powers, came winding and rouling out of the inchanted house, with such an amazed gesture, that Diatassan ceaz'd him in his armes before he could imagine he was vnceaz'd of his torments; and after him issued forth diuers others, some flying one way, some another, in such a confused manner of distraction that no eie could sencibly discerne, either what were their persons, ranke or conditions. The damned Misantropos , seeing this desolation hurl'd vpon his wickednesse, came forth, and with all the coniurations, spels, and characters, which formerly had bound the greatest Kings of deuils to his obedience, he againe assaies if he can either hold from further perishing, or else, at least, repaire the misery of his mis-fortunes, but when he saw the more he labour'd, that still to worse end the toile of his labours conuerted, a damnable desperation tooke hold vpon him, and according to the true nature of premeditate and resolued wickednesse, hee entombes himselfe within the ruines of that decayed house, and setting all things which were about him on fire, he there, with many most grieuous exclamations and cursings expired his life into cynders. All this while, Diatassan held Thirsis in his armes, without respect, or knowledge of what fortune befell the Inchanter, and Thirsis on the other side, stood staring in the eies of Diatassan , whom he supposed to be some new tormentor, and besought him, in as much as his features and comlinesse of of person did exceed all his former persecutors, not to couer to enlarge the ocean, or seeke to make his afflictions greater, which were so vnbounded, as no imagination, strength, or patience, was able to containe them. But Diatassan , freeing him from his embracement, said; Behold my Thirsis , thou art no more a slaue to hellish cruelty, but art freed from thy bonds, and made once more Maister of thine owne person. At liberty (said Thirsis ?)  o do not delude me with false hope, making the consumption of my ioyes, the infinite redoublers of my most vnspeakeble torments. Beleeue it (said Diatassan ) thou art at perfect and secure liberty, I pray thee open thine inchanted eies, and looke vpon mee, I am thy friend, and fellow Sheepheard, indeed I am Diatassan , and dare boldly assure thee, that all illusions and inchantments are vtterly banished, and there is not any opposition betwixt thee and thy freedome; Alas, it was to me, and to euery gentle soule, a sorrow insufferable, to heare of the manner of thyne afflictions, and to behold the, not to be exceeded, sorrow which all the Sheepheards in Tempe made for thy absence, some breaking their Pipes, and for-swearing all Country Musicke; some tearing their Sonnets, and abiuring all Poesy; one vowes he will neuer more throw either Dart, or Axle-tree; and another protests, he will neuer more runne, either at Basse, or Barly-breake; Eccho shall hence-forth repeate no Carrols but Ellegies, the Water-nymphes shall loose their fountaines and their shadowes; the Fawnes shall forgoe the seruice of Bacchus , and the Satyrs shall neuer more attend vpon drunken Silenus : Hence I began to study by what Art or Industry I might procure thine infranchsement, and in the end, by the help of this my fellow Swaine (vnto whose skill the Gods themselues are propitious) I found a meanes to shake of thy fetters, and to make thy foule pryson, like a surfeited stomacke, to cast thee forth into the world, that thy friends might take comfort in thy society. When Thirsis , whose eies, by this time, were cleerely opened, and into whose little Kingdomes were againe restored memory, knowledge, and iudgement, with their three faithfull companions, Retention, Truth, and Discretion, saw himselfe deliuered thus minutely, against all expectation, euen by him, whom of all men he supposed to be the greatest enemy to his happinesse; whose loues being fixed vpon one obiect, like two Emperous riuals war'd and contended, to bring disgrace to each others actions; when hee saw this generous designe thus nobly performed (Time, hauing not in former times, preserued a president of so great worthinesse) with a soule ten thousand times more thankefull then his deliuerance was carefull; hee embrac't Diatassan in his armes, and said. Thou Mirrour of all noble curtesie, whose excellent charity hath preserued a life, not worthy thy painefulnesse; let mee assure thee, that whatsoeuer thou hast giuen mee is nothing but thine owne riches, neither will I keepe it, or esteeme it for any thing but thine employment; my life, assure thee, shall bee a tribute euer payable, when thou wilt command it; and al-be hitherto it hath beene infinitely neglected by me, henceforth I will prize it at better rate, till it haue done some acceptable seruice for thee. Diatassan gaue him infinite thankes for the tender of so much affection, but there-with-all acknowledged that no worth or work in him was worthy of such merite; and thus, after diuers and sundry ceremonious embracements on euery side, with a world of thankfulnesse to the most famous Elpyno, Diatassan perswaded Thirsis that he would be pleased to goe home with him to his Cabinet, and there a while refresh himselfe, till he had smoothed those wrinkles which sorrowfull afflictions had ingrauen vpon him. Thirsis , whose very soule was now engaged to the loue of Diatassan , holding it a sinne vnremittable to deny whatsoeuer he demanded, consented to his request; and so Elpyno sounding his shrill pipe, they began to depart from that vnhallowed valley: but hardly were they moued so farre that their motion might be discerned, when Elpyno espyed on the ground the speare belonging to the great Goddesse Minerua , which he perfectly knew, and the Nymph to whose charge it was alotted, and so taking it vp, he concluded, that the Nymph whom Diatassan supposed to be the Princesse, was onely Nerina , by the hand of some euill fate imbarked in that danger; to whom he said he would re-deliuer her charge, left the losse thereof might loose her the fauour of the Goddesse: and then setting his pipe againe to his lip, they departed from that vnhallowed ground, and came into their owne walkes; where, because the euening began to put on her worst countenance of darknesse, the two yong sheepheards tooke their solemne leaues of the graue Elpyno , promising to be euer at his commandement when any occasion should craue their imployment; and so they departed to their seuerall homes. When the silence of the darke night, and the politicke Diatassans most cunning knowledge in paths remote, and vnfrequented, had brought sad Thirsis vnseene, vnsuspected, and vnthought of vnto his Cabinet, after they had a while reposed themselues by a cleere fire, and tasted the countrey fruits of that seasons ripenesse, and made Lieus swim in their well-spiced Mazers, being now not any but themselues in that little cottage, and the still night lending a gentle eare to their discourse, Diatassan in the end, brake forth into these speeches. Man (my Thirsis ) in his first creation, was not made for the tillage of the earth, for the inuention of fundamentall lawes, for the ordering of Common- wealthes, nor for the obeying, or being obeyed in the seuerall chaires of much different or distinguisht greatnesse; but he was made onely, with a thannfulnesse equall to the blessings hee had receiued, in all his actions and meditations to sound forth the most glorious praise of the most Diuine and onely omnipotent Alpha ; nothing being so high-prized in his sacred nature, as thankfulnes  & obediece. Hence, from this great statute (whose forfeture is no lesse then eternall destruction) is deriued a little bond, or obligation betweene man and man, teaching vs that the duty of thankfulnesse excelleth all the offices belonging to mans life; the breach whereof is no lesse then damnation to our good names, and a perpetual obloquy left to liue with our memories. I speake not this (deere Thirsis ) either to intimate any dobtfulnesse in the excellency of thy nature, or to stirre thee to any better consideration of thine owne goodnesse then the bent of thine owne will, (euer aimed at the noblest part of perfection) shall by thy reason euer present before thee; but I do it in respect of mine own mis-fortunes, which hath drawn my life so neere to the worst of deathes cruelty, that onely alone, without thine aid and assistance, I am nothing but the most miserablest caitife breathing: Therefore if either my loue or deseits, or any other merit in the painefulnesse of my seruice, haue had the power to gaine the heauenly Iewel of thy deerest esteemed friendship: then by them all I beseech thee, giue me leaue to coniure thy loue; and by thine own remembrance, which is the best register of things most acceptable to thine eye, vouchsafe to grant me one suite, in which thy consent giueth me a happy life; but thy denyall a death sudden, bitter, and most disgracefull. Thirsis vnable to wade in the still-deepe-streame of the cunning Sheepheards cogitations; and whose innocent minde, framing her thoughts to her owne likenesse, was free from deceit or circumuention, told Diatassan , that to him, who had no part left in himselfe which he accounted his owne, but was all vniuersally giuen ouer to be imployed in any aduenture, how dangerous soeuer (so it pleased his will to guide him thereunto) which might bring him the least contentment; there was no need of this coniuration; and therefore humbly besought him, from an open and direct breast, to discharge his desires, assuring him, by all the protestations of a constant faith; nay, that he might annex better beliefe to his vnreuocable vowes, hee sware by Melidora's white hand, by her hopes of honour, and by the holy festiuall of her most happy marriage, that no action should be so strange, no stratagem so secure, nor no danger so ineuitable and certaine to breed destruction, which he would not, with all willingnesse, enter into, so it might redound but to the least figure of his satisfaction. I but (said Diatassan ) the strangenesse of the danger is able to diuert strangely your resolution. Not so (said Thirsis ) all be it can put on vizards more vgly then euer perill was disguised in: for beleeue it, whosoeuer feareth danger, must necessarily feare friendship. But (replyed Diatassan ) what if the action bee insupportable? Then (quoth Thirsis ) the greater honour attends the conquest, and vertue neuer loueth to wade in a shallow streame. What (said Diatassan ) if the mischiefe concerne your selfe more then any other? Then (said Thirsis ) shall I haue fewer riuals in mine honour then any other. I beseech thee do not seeke to coward me with these suppositions, or thinke thou canst threaten away from me, any part of my resolution: for I haue vowed, and will neuer repent any part of such vowes, that whatsoeuer I can do to doe thee seruice, I will do with that cheareful willingnes, that euen in the greatest extremity of my danger, nothing shall appeare which shall daunt my courage. Diatassan beholding him thus constant, and knowing by ancient experience, how vertuously he was euer addicted; banishing all feare, doubt, or distrust of Apostacy, boldly, and in plaine phrase deliuered vnto him the tenor of the proclamation, which by the voluntary consent of the Princesse, was not onely sent through all Tempe , but euen through all the coastes of Arcadia also; assuring vnto any man that could exceed her, either in swiftnes, or in shooting, an eternall possession both of her, and her fauours. Now my Thirsis (said Diatassan ) it is knowne vnto vs all within these launds, especially vnto my selfe, whose neerer intimacy hath made me more familiar with your contentions, that not any Sheepheard, Woodman, Satyre, nor Fairy, is able to match her in the excellency of either of those skils (your selfe onely excepted,) whom I haue oft beheld so farre to exceed her, that many times a passion of discontentment, like vnto anger, hath made her say, shee would no more take pleasure in such controuersies. Therefore the fauour which I begge at thy hands (whose true performance may make me the happiest sheepheard liuing) is, that you will be pleased in my garments, disguise, and priuate abilliments (all which are well knowne to the eye of euery Sheepheard) to try the force  & vertue of your best art; and vnder my name, as well as my figure, to win the Princesse for me: an act, which if you be pleased to performe, you shall not onely giue me an ample satisfaction for all my seruices imploied in your deliuerance, but for euer hereafter containe me as your vowed seruant, and most surest obliged creature: If contrariwise you be pleased to grant repulse to my hard, and most painefull demand, doe but giue the least signe of such distaste, and you shall instantly behold his death, whose miserable life was neuer made worthy, but when it was imployed in the worke of your deliuerance. As soone as Thirsis had heard the Sheepheards whole relation, and perceiued that his life was preserued but to confound his life, being compelled by his vowes, to giue away that litle hope which hitherto maintained a weake life, full of all agony, and all the distemperatures, passions, frenzies, and grieued torments which either misery or dispaire could lay vpon him, turning himselfe from Diatassan , as if only he meant to talke with his consideration in a matter so strange, and neerely concerning the life-long-bitternesse of his euer-lothed life, he lift vp his hands to heauen, and wringing them one within another, he said; Fortune, o Fortune! thou euer-displeased enemy to my rest, when wilt thou glut thy selfe with the huge masse of mine vnspeakeable lamentations, and beholding my miseries, on the highest scale of despaire, vouchsafe by my death, an end to mine ouer-wrackt calamities? When wilt thou be weary of creating me new disasters? and finde out for thy fury some other subiect, whose greater worthinesse may bring greater renowne to thy cruelty? Me? alasse! why me hast thou chosen on whom to discharge all the Arrowes of thy vnsatisfied wrath, my life hauing no respect in the world, and so thy reuenge depriued all memory and reputation? Tell mee (thou that art neuer greatest in goodnesse) wherein haue I offended thy Deity? Which of thy Temples haue I euer prophaned? What Altars of thine haue I razed? How many Statues haue I defaced? When did I extinguish any of thy liuing Fires, or in contempt of thy power, said; There was disproportion in a circular motion? Haue I (at any time) made thy God-head disputable? or raised (by mine heresies) doubtfulnesse amongst thy best followers? Haue my constant torments made mee blaspheame thy name? or say (for all my firme-setled sorrowes, that thou hadst no might in inconstancy? Haue I not (with my best wits) defended thy mutability? and compared it to the seasons of the yeere, to the course of mans life, and to the delight of his sences; the first confounded, if any bee wanting; the next imperfite, if by alteration not increased; and the last dull and vselesse, if not for the distinguishing of sundry obiects: O thou that art most mighty by mens ruines, and the foundation of whose throne standeth on the subuertion of Empires; I beseech thee to bee pleased, that in this last act of my long labour'd Tragedy, I may haue leaue to die, peacebly, and obscurely! Alas! my loue, which was euer accompanied with a seuere disdaine, brought (in comparison of this) to my heart but an vnfelt distemperature; my thraldome with Mysantropos , where the torments of hell are presented in their most feeling hidiousnesse, was (being compared with this) but a golden chaine of desired seruitude. Nay, what imagination hath a circumference so large, as to bound within it a misfortune so fatall, and incomprehensibly tyranous: but indiscreete that I am, whether doth my mad agony transport mee? Haue I not premeditatly sworne, with aduised thoughts, and deliberate considerations, that my life shall not be valewed with the true worth of his deserts, who brought me from an intollerable bondage, and doe I now stammer in my resolution? No, I am confident, and the worst and best, which can way befall mee, is but a death long expected, and now come a little howre before my preparation; my faithfull promise is my vertue, and before that shall suffer my life shall ten thousand times ruine; for I had rather this memory should liue on my graue-stone, that my faith gaue away my life, then that my periury had ingratefully gotten mee a goodnesse, which would onely hate me for the vilenesse of my purchase. And, heere, turning himselfe about to Diatassan , who all this while stood in a great amazement, troubled with doubtfull thoughts what resolution hee should receiue from his sorrowfull Sheepheard, hee deliuered him this answere. Thou hast ( Diatassan ) by a double bond tyed mee euer vnto thy seruice; first, by releasing mee from the torments of Mysantropos ; and now, by deliuering mee from the worlds worst iniuries: for thou hast now brought mee a death so certaine and easie, that in one moment all my malignities shall expire, and I shall then sleepe calmely in my graue, that with tempestious blasts and stormes fearefully raging haue had my life euer enuironed; onely bee thou cheerefull and merry, who art the onely delightfull Nightingall of the warmest season, and one, whom the onely Goddesse of the world will make the choisest darling of her most deerest delight. For this beleeue, (Sheepheard) as firmely as thou beleeuest any worke of Destiny, that the life I vowed to giue thee for my life, I will pay thee in this worke faithfully and truely, two-fold; First, in my conquest, of which, except both Gods and Nature infinitely conspire to crosse mee, I neither despaire nor doubt of; and next, in her, who hauing euer borne my life in her bosome, by giuing her, I shall giue thee not onely my life, but whatsoeuer else in my life was esteemed pretious: And this I will do, as willingly and faithfully, as thou desirest it seriously and carefully: and therefore argue no more the alteration of my resolution, neither call to minde mine infortunate loue, but building vpon that integrity, which I haue hitherto preserued spotlesse, with my reputation, rest assured, that I will either purchase thy wish, or else my selfe, for euer, loose the vse of wishing. At these wordes, Diatassan tooke the sad Sheepheard in his armes, and kissing his cheeke, told him; His noble curtesy should neuer die, but, whilst either time, or memory should liue vpon the earth, so long there should dwell a register of his excellent faith and constancy. And there-with-all he entreated him to cast away all care and griefe, and no more to make sorrow his onely familiar, assuring him that Fortune had many treasures, yet, lockt vp for him; which, doubtlesse, would in the end bring all his desires to that port, at which hee, onely, coueted to cast Anchor. But Thirsis replyed, My griefes and I, am of so long, and so inseparable familiarity, that it is as easie to take from any Element his predominant quality, as to dis-vnite the league which is combined betwixt vs: and for the enioyment of my desires, they are, alas, so farre remoued from hearing my complaints, that sooner shall wee, and our Antipodes , warme vs at one instant with one Sunne-shine, then they euer meete to do me ease in my trouble. But letting my miseries sleepe in my owne brest, I pray thee tell mee, Sheepheard, when is the triumphant day which must decide this controuersy? And Diatassan told him, the very next morrow insuing; which in as much as it came stealing, fast vpon them, with swift vndiscerned paces, and now the night was almost growne to the middle point of her gouernement, faire Cassiopeia twinkling her little sparkes in at euery small cranny, hee perswaded the melancholy Sheepheard to betake himselfe to his repose, assuring him that the next morning all things should bee prepared in readinesse, both for his disguise and all other accomplishments needfull in that curious businesse. Thirsis , gaue him many thankes, and so, for that night, went to his rest; where he rested with so much vnrest, that as if his bed had bene made of thorne, or imbost with needles, hee could find in no part of it either ease, or enticement to slumber, but tossing and rouling to and fro, curssing his fortune which had made him his owne executioner, and accusing Nature that had giuen him perfection, to make all his happinesse most imperfect, hee consumed the weary time with such pittious moanes, and bitternesse of anguish, that Barbarisme, it selfe, would haue bene grieued with his lamentations. But leauing him, in the trouble of his owne passionate thoughtfulnesse, let mee returne to the vertuous Princesse; who, with a griefe nothing inferiour to the distressed Sheepheard; and with a shame, infinitely superiour to all others bashfulnesse, so spent the calme season of the quiet night, that the faire spangled sky, in lamentable commisseration of her teares and sighings, let fall to the earth many of her cleere lights, to shew that her moanes, onely, depriued her of glory: O, it is vnsearchable, and past reuelation for the tongue of man to tell the depth of her diuersly bewailings; for one while, the vnkindnesse of Diatassan , his apostacy, periury, and inhumanity, ceaz'd to their vse, the whole substance of her thought; then Thirsis thraldome, his vertue, constancy, and patient misery, tooke vp the whole compasse of her minde; and lasty, her owne shame, who hauing giuen into her power a full power to worke, both hers, and his happinesse with all powerfulnesse, through a weake womanish distrust, and a iealousy, full of absurde impossibility, not onely to loose the blisse of that occasion, but with her irresolution to leaue her-selfe in the danger of destruction; these heauy weights of anguish fell so grieuously on her troubled soule, that they banisht, not onely sleepe from her wet eies, but all things else, which, in any measure, carried the similitude of his charracter; now shee repents the freedome of her proclamation, and wishes, she could vnwish what her wishes had created. The Nymph Ethera she is shamed to see, because her very lookes will discouer her pusyllanimity. The Nymph Nerina she is affraid to see, because she had not onely, neglected her counsell, but depriued her of that Iewell, belonging to the Goddesse, whose losse not any account could satisfie: Thus tormented in her mind with these thoughts, which like so many mercilesse executioners toare and diuided her soule into many painful parts, she woare out the length of that ill-boding night, whose dew-wet dank wings, flag'd and flew so slowly that the day was forst to chide her from the earth, and with her bright siluer Mace to ding her head-long downe into the bottome of the Ocean; and now the Sunne, armed with his Bow, and his best Darts, as if hee ment to haue become a Champion in those sports, entred his Chariot (which was trimmed with Hellitropeans , and with Roses) so gloriously, that the brightnesse of his first countenance tooke all drowsinesse from mens sences, and made euery Nymph, Sheepheard, and Forrester bestirre themselues about that daies triumph. The Princesse seeing now, that time, and her owne pleasure, had brought her iniuries vpon her, and thrust her head-long into that maze, out of which she had no way to passe, but by the direct line of iustice, willing to bee content, where no vnwillingnesse could breed her satisfaction, and trusting in the vertue of her owne excellency, which shee doubted not, but would defend her from all vndesired claymes; With a heart full of forc'd, and most vnpleasant contentment, shee arose from her dumbe counsel-keeper, the pillow; and, with the helpe of her Hand-maids, adorned her selfe so curiously in Loose-silks, Cipresse, Thinne-lawnes, and Tiffanies, each being puft, and inter-changeably knotted one with another, that Zephirus himselfe, would haue giuen halfe his Deity for so curious and light a garment: Her Buskins were sutable, and couered onely the small of her legge; vpon her head she woare nothing but a light Coronet of small (yet rich) Iewels; and about her necke shee woare a Carkanet of seeming flowers, but, indeed, they were cut out of pretious stones of their naturall colours: When she was fully imbellished, according to her desire, knitting her quiuer to her side, and taking her Bow into her hand, shee descended downe into her great Chamber, where shee found all the choisest Nymphes of Tempe , in their checkred, and youthfull brauery, adorned so richly, that like so many Starres, they were ready to waite on her, their onely best adored Cinthia . The formost, and best preferred, being the Nymph Apheleia , on whom the Princesse could by no meanes looke without blushing. Next her, stood Ethera , whose heart was big, because her tongue, in that place, could not haue leaue to expostulate with the Princesse. Next her, was nimble-tongued Egeria , a Nymph famous for Rydles, Rymes, and her affection to Poets. Then there was witty Paulina , a Wench, that naturally spake Epygrams, for few words past from her without a double signification, giuing wits leaue to conster after their owne dispositions, or wantonly, or chastly. By her stood demure Driope , a Nymph that in publicke kept a paire of ballance betweene her lips, waying all things which proceeded from them, but priuately would take liberty to proue, shee was as imperfect as a woman. Not farre from her was modest Celta , a Nymph whose discretion guarded her from mens mis-constructions, and whose vertue tempred her actions with such an indifferent hand, both in disdaine and his contrary, that not any man had cause either to boast of her fauours, or yet to repine at the cruelty of her worst countenance. Siluia stood by her side, a Nymph that maintained many heresies in loue, saying: woemen ought to chuse husbands, as wise-men chuse Balieffes, men too simple to deceiue, yet euer so prouident, that they will let no wealth escape them. As for the foure Cardinall vertues, or any other singularity either of minde or body, she held them fit ornaments for seruants whom the plaid with, not for husbands whom they liued with. Next her, was wanton Petula ; a Nymph that held strongly the opinion of Corisca , which was, that women should vse their louers like their smockes, haue many, change oft, and neuer vse but one at once. Besides these, there was a world of others, as Amarillis, Gallatea ,  & Glauca, Thestilis, Amarantha , and Belisa , and a whole beauy, whose names to record, were a labour troublesome and needlesse. Not farre from the Lodge of the Princesse, within a Laund which was richly checkered, and intrayled, with many sorts of most delicate flowers, planted onely by the hand of Nature, with any assistance of Art: there was seated, a most faire and goodly Amphi-theater , the out-side whereof was onely built of a smoth and exceeding rich stone, and the ioints did so artificially close and meete together, without discouering the cyment, or shewing to the eie the mixture of their seuerall crests, that a very good iudgement might haue bene bome with, if it had maintained, that it had bene compacted of one stone onely, but the in-side which was diuided into many large Galleries,  & seates of great state was erected of goodly pillars of diuers coloured Marbles, whose differences were so diuided, and artificially mixed one with another, that they gaue to the eye of the stranger an amazed delight, full of admiration. All the other parts were richly guilt, and imbosted with most curious Bostage, and adorned with many rare Antickes; in whose liuely figures the work-men had shewed such curiousnesse of skill, that Nature was many times deceiued, supposing them to be her liuing Images. This Theater was built for many purposes, as first for the hearing & determining of all causes corrigible: Next, for the entertainmet of all Pastoral sports, and Eglogs: Then for the tryals of Sheepheards maisteries, either in wrastling, leaping, dauncing, throwing the barre, or fledge; and generally for any publique vse or assembly, where the worthinesse of the action did admit any respectiue regard to the eyes of the beholders. To this Theater the Nympes attended the Princesse, where she was to repose her selfe till the Forresters should giue notice of the preparation of the sports: and because of the greatnesse of the occasion which brought forth this day of admirable triumph, the roomes were more richly adorned & beautified with hangings of costly arras, then at any time formerly it had been; the floore of the stage was all couered ouer with most rich carpets of needle-worke, & the rest hung about with cloth of gold, and tyssue: vpon whose frontispice was placed the three prizes, for those three, whose fortunes should that day aduance them by their excellence to the merit of such goodnesse, beyond their fellowes. The first of which was the picture of the Princesse, exceeding rarely drawne, and adorned with many pretty Iewels: and although no art was able to come neere the exquisitenesse of her naturall perfection; yet this was so neere in many most especiall features, that euery eye was able to iudge whose proportion it presented. The second was Thamiclodias harpe, which Paris , when he liued on the mount Ida , in his Sheephardish obscurity (knowing no greatnesse, but the gouernement of his flockes; nor goodnesse, but the Nymph Oenon ) played on, with that happinesse of skill, that hee stirred wonder and emulation in all his fellow- sheepheards which heard him; it was richly bound together in euery ioynt with seames of pure gold; and the same inchased with many pretious stones of great estimation. The last was a garland made in the manner of a Morisco Coronet, and crosse twound and inueloped with many curious and intricate knots, which onely were distinguished by the colours  & artificiall placing of the flowers, euery ioynt and border being bound together with fine knotted rapes of small pearle. This was the hand-worke of the Nymph Apheleia , who in the same had portrayed forth so much rarity of skill, that had Arachne beheld it, she would haue ben so much ashamed of her profession, that she would neuer haue dared to chalenge Diana . After the Princesse had reposed herselfe here a pretty space, oft striuing to draw her thoughts to an vnity, whose continuall warre increase both her trouble and torment: In the end the braue Forrester Siluagio , attended with many other yong Fosters, all in their woodmens liueries of greene, strip'd with siluer-lace, with their Bugles hung in rich baudricks about their neckes, entred the Theater, and declared vnto the Princesse that the Tyger was lodged, the toyles pitched, the hewee set, and euery other needfull preparation so ordered and placed in their best conuenience, that nothing was wanting which could any way bring perfection to that dayes noble triumph. Besides, he aduertised her, that the Sheepheards, which that day meant to engage themselues within the honorable lists of that noble contention, were all in a readinesse; euery man being suited in seueral colours, according to the councell of their imaginations; and wearing on their armes, or breasts, deepe, mysticall, and learned Empresaes, discouering the strength of their hopes, & the depth of their wishes: concluding that the Sun was got so high vp into the heauens, that her greatnesse could not with any conuenience loose more time, without much hurt to her hopes, and wonderful great impeachment to the sports, and their labours. The Princesse returned him answere, that she was in a perfect readinesse, and had long in that place attended his summons; yet before she would issue forth, she intreated him to deliuer vnto her what Sheepheards were in a readinesse, and stood to try maisteries with her that day; and also what deuises, not all, but the most principall bare about the, that by their inuentions she might adiudge the worthinesse of their discretions. To which Siluagio replied, that the army was so great as to make a particular relation of them all, was to consume the day in no other exercise; onely for those few which were most note-worthy in his eyes, their characters were these. The first (he said) was youthfull Menalchas , a swaine that was so much beholden to Nature for his features, that he scorned to be indebted to Education for any part of the gouernement of his life: and therefore was like a faire picture, much better to gaze on then to commerce with; whence it sprang, that being onely contented with himselfe, he made respect of no other society: his garments are all of a russet colour, signifying his hope, and his deuice, which he carries faire depainted vpon his quiuer, is a Dormouse sleeping, the word, Quiescendo Pinguesco , alluding that his former quietnes hath fed him with so much pleasure, that nothing but this occasion could awaken him to these troubles. Next vnto him is amorous Amintas , one whose affection is so actiue, and laxatiue, that wanting a true subiect whereon to discharge his passions, he will let fall his desires vpon insensible obiects; and yet infinitely defend his owne constancy, in as much as at no time he is inamored of two seuerall creatures: his loue, like a hammer, which driues out one nayle with another, expelling the first fury with the second madnes: his garments are all of pure watchet chamblet; vpon his breast hauing liuely embrodered a faire Helitropean flowre, bowing his head according to the course of the Sun,  & the word, Soli Phoebo ; signifying, that howsoeuer he hath formerly been transported with a various humour of many alterations; yet notwithstanding the true Sunne, which is absolute beauty, is euer his constant obiect. Neere him is renowned Colin ; a Sheepheard, that for all the perfections both of minde and body, is worthy to march in the first ranke of men, esteemed most compleat, being a man whom no greatnesse of Fortune can make to neglect his first beginning, nor no lownesse in mishap make stoope to the least signe of basenesse; no, though it should come clothed in the best glories of vnstain'd-honesty: his garments are all of greene Tammell, and on his arme he beares brauely depainted, a Parret, climbing vp a tree both by head and feet; and the word, Lento pede , signifying that goodnesse is not gotten by violence, or rashnesse, but by gentle and easie steps, men fixing their feet constantly and firmly: for scales are neuer leapt vp, but with much difficulty slowly walkt vp, euery member being imployed for a mans safety; by which allusion he intimates, that in this controuersie he will discreetly apply all the powers, both of his mind and body, worthily to gaine the fauour of the most worthie creature breathing. Next him standeth strong-limb'd Hobynol , a swaine whom all-be Nature hath not cast in her best mowld for the eyes delight, yet she hath fashioned him best for vse, and the imployment of most respected seruice: his garments are of a sky-coloured serge, spangled in euery seame with little Oes of gold; and on his skirts are richly embrodered a golden hoope, sent from the heauens, and possessed by a hand, vnder which is this word; Nec plus, nec minus , intimating that if his fortune should make him maister of that rare Iewell which the Gods themselues keepe in their best safeguard, that then hee had all the contentment he would wish, and more or lesse he would neuer hereafter couet. Amongst these are rankt the two amorous Sheepheards of Laconia , braue Carino , and discreet Credulo , who equally louing the faire Nymph Cynthia , haue administred to the world great admiration, both in the constantnesse of their affection; whose flame, though it be violent, yet burnes without distemperature: in their strange ryuallship, wherein is contained neither enuy, nor ill-wishes; and in their vnspotted friendships, which is a president exceeding all the honorable masculine-loues which haue beene recorded since the first ages. These Sheepheards are suited both after one fashion, in willow-coloured Taffata, all knotted ouer with a tawny silke lace, and the deuice which they beare, is a Geometricall rule, and the word importing, that no affection can bee happy or prosperous which is not bounded within the limits of wisedome. A world of other Sheepheards there are, whom to decipher, were a worke Herculian and tedious: onely one, who, like a cleere Sunne in a new troubled sky, which makes, with his brightnesse, euery thing looke cloudy about him, is the noble, and most courtly Sheepheard Diatassan ; who close armed, according to his vsuall custome in the like exercises, is mounted vpon his snow-white Barbary-horse, whom hee maketh performe such strange salts, that fire mounts not from the earth more lightly, nor can nimble Cats wind or turne in so straight a compasse; Art so farre excelling Nature, that shee seemes to be the true schoolemistres to all deliuer action; whilest he, as if incorporated, and made one substance with the beast, sits so vnmoueably-mouing, that not an ouer-curious eye can imagine either disturbance or painefulnesse in any of his motions; he beareth in his right hand a Dart, curiously framed of most pure Iuory, and on his left arme, which beareth his bridle, is a faire shield, cut Scutchion-wise, in which is very liuely portrayed forth Cupid , halfe hidden in a faire brooke, and casting a stone into the riuer, whose first touch of the water making a circle no bigger then the stone, from that little circle growes circle vpon circle, till it haue extended to the vttermost verdge of the water: the word importing, that his constant actions in this honourable loue, though at first they appeare no bigger then the small stone, yet shall they so increase in all excellent perfection, that they shall finde no bound to containe them. The wondring Sheepheards stand gazing vpon him; and are so ouer-delighted with the excellency of his rare shew, that as if they drunke a Lethe from his actions, they stand, as it were, lost in their wonder, forgetting all things but what is contained in that pleasing obiect. Many other things (Madame) there is note-worthy in this faire Army of Sheepheards, but none so pretious as these with which I haue acquainted your most excellent attention. When the Princesse had heard the Forresters Gentlemanlike description of the Sheepheards, and had noted his ouer-flow of commendations layd vpon the person of Diatassan , she turned her head aside, and gaue her thoughts leaue to say to her heart: O that vnworthinesse should euer bee so ready to furnish vp our delights, whilst true worth it selfe lyes hidden where no eye can reueale it! Alasse! Diatassan is here he that hath nothing but the vizard of vertue, seeming like that, to which of all things hee is most contrary: but Thirsis is not here, hee that is not like, but is all vertue himselfe, whose cheeke was neuer painted with any adulterate colour of false goodnesse. O Thirsis, Thirsis , hearest thou not that which all Tempe, I all Thessaly , nay all Greece heares? that whose shrill sound hath awaked Arcadia , and made euen the Wood-gods and Satyrs leaue their well-closed thickets to come and be witnesses of our actions? Art thou onely sencelesse of our wishes, or haue mine ancient disdains so deafned and deiected thy once- admired spirit, that as a man in a Lethargie thou doest slumber out all those opportunities which should either giue thy selfe or me any contentment? Woe is mee alasse! neither of these doe perplexe thee, a much stronger bond of most vnhallowed inchantment is the restraint of thy presence, making me vnfortunate in thine absence, and giuing audacious boldnes to those weake spirits who with thy very sight would haue vanisht,  & neither haue attempted any danger or trouble: But since the venome hand of fortune hath mesured my destiny with these crosse-lines, and made me a slaue both to chance and mens vnsetled opinions, I am resolued, that my resolution, Art, and and dexterity (which till this howre hath neuer faild mee) shall once againe make mee free; so that being vntomb'd from these foulds and snares of selfe-wil'd incumbrance, I shall once againe behold those calme daies of safety, which formerly with much delight, I haue euer enioyed. The Princesse was not so much perplexed and troubled in her disquieted thoughts; but on the other part, the Nymph Apheleia was ten times more vexed with intollerable passions, of anger, feare, and and iealousy, when her eares had but drunke in the sound that her Sheepheard Diatassan was prepared to try Masteries that day with the Princesse. Feare perswading her that the true excellencies which were in Melidora (super-excelling all the Dames in Europe ) might very well proue such attractiue motiues to the tendernesse of his yong vnsetled iudgement, that cloathing his reuolt in Fortunes falsest colours, hee might with an vnblushing cheeke leaue her forsaken and despised: which perswasion, her anger makes certaine and vndoubted, saying. That, but hee was infected with the leprosy of lustfull change, it was impossible hee should ingage himselfe thus pompously into a contention, wherein the maine end was nothing but the enioying of a new Mistresse, leauing her honest faith naked, to the scorne of her emulators, and his owne priuate derision: Which (shee said) hee should no sooner bring to passe, but her iust reuenge, banishing all things but what was absolutely mixt with the most vgliest despaire, should so tyrannize ouer his ill sullied body, that sleepe-wanting Nursses should bring their wrangling babes to rest, with the fearefull report of her cruelty. And this wrathfull resolution was scarce setled in her bosome, when, euer, ill-counselling-Iealousy, not onely applaudes it, but brings also to her remembrance a thousand crosse Chimeras , and ill countenances of his falshood; and now she cals to mind her last encounter with him, wherein his vnkind flight,  & her too kind pursuite, was a volume large enough for her to reade the great story of his mutability, and the vtter banishment of all that noble affection which shee had placed most vnworthily in him. These three tormentors of the minde, with so many vexations rackt and macerated her deadly afflicted soule; that if honour, and honourable construction, had not suddenly entred, and gotten, in despight of their aduersaries, a quiet place in her thoughts, she had there giuen leaue to impatience to haue publisht her agonies, and with much distracted resolution had giuen disturbance to all their sports. But honour, which is, euer, the cleerer of imputation, resolues her that his ends are noble and full of vertue, intending but to shew the world his power, not his loue, and that hauing wonne the best Prize, hee will augment the betternesse thereof, by giuing it's lost freedome againe to it's owne disposure: a worke most gratefull to the Princesse, honorable to himselfe, and full of admiration to all his beholders; and with these cogitations, her heart being a little appeased, fearefull that any worse remembrances should blot out their goodnesse, she turnes to the Princesse, and puts her in minde of the consumption of the day; the ready preparation of the sports, and the expectation of her seruiceable contenders; vpon which aduertisement, the Princesse returned answere, that shee was ready, and willed them to set forward. So the Forresters, in their greene Liueries, with their Bugles in rich Baudrickes, about their neckes, guilt Iauelings in their hands, and veluet collars gold-studded with silken Lyams at their girdles, marched two and two before the Princesse: The meane and yong Fosters going euer formost, and the grauer and better authorized following after. Behind the Princesse followed all the Nymphes in equall cooplets; the best, and of choisest respect going formost, and the meaner following according to their rankes and places: Being in this comely equipage issued out of the Amphitheater , the Sheepheards, vpon the first beholding of the Princesse, gaue a great shout,  & the ranking her on either side, like two wings in a well ordered Battell, they marched into the strength, and heart of the Forrest, where the Tyger was lodged, to whose Kennell when they were some-what neerely approached, the Forresters caused them to make a stand, and then placing the Princesse with a little aduantage before, all the Sheepheards, who ingaged themselues in the contention, were in two rankes marshald on either hand of her: only Thirsis , who the was supposed to be the youthfull Diatassan , presuming vpon the strength of his owne fortune, stood alone by himselfe a pretty distance behind them all, and now the Forresters vncoupling their Hounds, and casting them off into the Thicket, euen in a thought of time vnkennelled the Tyger, whose tell-tale feete (being true intelligencers to his aduersaries noses) made his most secret pathes so publickely knowne, that the chace continued long, swift, hot, and without respite: Now did the Musicke of the well-mouthed Hounds make the Trees shake their leaues for ioy, whose ratling murmure seemed to giue seconds to their clamours; the shoutes, and hallowings of the Sheepheards beate the hollow vaultes of heauen with such a rebounding noyse, that many Ecchoes, straining their shrill voyces, doubled and trebled euery single acclamation, and the Forresters winding their loud hornes, sent such a peale through the vast Desarts, that they awaked all the vntamed inhabitants therof, striking such fearefulnesse into their mindes, that no remembrance was left which could instruct them to any safety; each of these, by themselues, were as a seuerall consort of wel-tuned Musicke, but being mixt together and made one body, of one vniuersall sound, they were so fearefull, and full of distracting admiration, that no stranger-eare but would haue ben deafened euen with the very eccho of the same. In this maine chase, wherein the Tyger, for his safety, made many deceitfull doublings, and interchangeable courses, both backe and forth, measuring the ground with such painefulnesse, that no secret corner was left by him vntrodden; of all the ranks of Nymphes, Sheepheards, or Forresters, whose mornings ostentations would haue made one beleeue no length of time could tire out their resolutions; not any was able to keepe the veiw of the Hounds but onely the Princesse, and the supposed Diatassan , who running in an euen line, without any coniecture of aduantage, made Art it selfe vnskilfull which should triumph in the victory; behind them, a little distance, ranne the Nymph Ethera , who seeing the equall doubtfulnesse of eithers fortunes, beganne to curse her ill-boading counsell, and wisht shee had lost her memory, before her remembrance gaue life to that vnfortunate designe: By this time the day was growne to his last age, and Phoebus bowing downe his head, that he might, with more familiar neerenesse, behold the differences in these Pastorall contentions, the long- wearied, and ouer-chased beast beganne to slacke his swifter foote-man-ship, and perceiuing that the twigs and brambles of the Thickets (on which his distilling sweate aboundantly dropped) were become his notorious betrayers, hee forsakes their false strenghts, and betakes himselfe into the plaine Launds, where hoping to finde some friendly Pond, or Riuer, in which hee might soile and refresh his tormented body, is so much deceiued in his trust, that as if Nature had lockt vp the heads of the Springs, there is no moisture left to coole the least sparke which inflames him: No sooner did the disguised Thirsis , behold the fierce beast to forsake the Woods, and with a much imbosted mouth to run madly inraged through the plaine Medowes, knowing that now came the howres of aduantage; with a redoubled speed hee sprang lightly vpon the earth, and out-stript the Princesse a good quantity of ground; which shee no sooner perceiued, but inflamed with a little displeased passion, she gathered her strength together, and like a gentle gale of Westerne wind, she ouer-tooke him againe  & flew before him; so that now their contention grew to the greatest extremity, one not being able to say this hath the aduantage before the other had the better; Fortune playing the wanton betweene them, and taking delight to giue assurance of hope to neither, which, vnexpected, doubtfulnesse when the diuine Melidora beheld, she could not chuse but, out of her amazement, thus say within her-selfe. How oft hath this yong man and I, in our Pastorall sportes, tryed our speeds together, yet neuer was he able (but with difficulty) to keepe the view of my foote-steps? Onely, now he is likely to bee my subduer: O iust heauens, what power haue I offended? or what Deity is it I haue neglected so much, that my vertue is taken from mee and giuen as a prey to him that is my greatest enemy? Diana ,  o Diana thou soueraigne protectresse of all chast thoughts, visite, I beseech thee, my mis-fortunes, and, either make mee free againe for thy seruice, or fixe mee to this earth a metamorphosed Monument for all thy handmaids to gaze on; and as her thoughts were thus talking, she sodainely ranne, not onely, before the supposed Diatassan , but euen before the formost Hound also, comming so neere to the halfe-tyred beast, that shee discharged one of her Darts at his life, with such wel-leuelled dexterity, that there was not a fingers bredth betwixt the beast and his destruction; when, vnknowne, Thirsis perceiued this, and saw with what narrownesse he had escaped much dishonour, he gathered all his best powers together, and running cheeke by ioule with the Princesse, there was Darte throwne for Darte, with such nimblenesse on both sides, that true winning seemed indifferently to be placed betweene them, gouerning their hands and bodies in euery motion, onely it seemed, that to the disguised Thirsis , shee lent her better, or right hand, for from him slew a Dart, with such euen and true aime, that it passed through the heart of the Tyger, leauing two open issues through, which in streames of bloud his life shed vpon the ground; but scarcely was the wounded beast falne, before the mistaken Sheepeheard came vnto him, and with a small Semytar which hee woare at his side hee diuided his head from his body, and as a Trophy of his most glorious and victorious conquest hee prickt it vpon the head of one of his Dartes, and so bore it through the fields, in the veiw of the most of the Sheepheards, which were present at those sportes, many of them crossing the waies to meete him, and to congratulate the blisse of his happy fortune; but, mistaken Thirsis knowing the danger of these caressing accomplyments, auoided their pressures, and with a nymble foote (whose swiftnesse none was able to imitate) hee held his direct way towards the Cabynet of Diatassan , loosing the sight, and knowledge of all his pursuers. When the Princesse beheld her selfe thus vanquisht, and, as it were, lost and diuided from her selfe, amazement, a little while, held passion out of her bosome, and perswaded her imaginations that it could not bee; which shee thought impossible to bee, but sight, and her remembrance, bearing witnes against such insubstantiall coniectures, she gaue discontentment leaue, in his worst and vgliest habyliments, to take full possession of her heart, deuising rather how shee might die vertuously, then liue tormented with one (meaning Diatassan ) so much in-glorious; and as shee was in the midst of these meditations the Nymph Ethera came vnto her, and seeing her downe-cast, and deiected sorowfulnesse shee humbly intreated to know the euent of her fortune, but could receiue from her no more but these words. Thou, and my beleefe, haue vndone mee, and I am now a prey to the worst that mis-fortune pleaseth; Which said, and hauing more griefe in her minde, then could by any Language bee expressed, shee tooke her way towards her owne Lodge, hauing no companion but onely her vnspeaking calamity, the Nymph Ethera following her a farre off, her owne shame, and Mellidoraes displeasure making her not dare, either with perswasion, or excuse, to attempt her interruption. And now the euening ending the day with the end of these delights, the Nympes and Sheepheards being gathered together, and the Forresters hauing broken vp the beast, and trust him on a Bore-speare, in a gallant and sollemne manner attended the Princesse to her Lodge, the next day, being the certaine and prefixed time in which the prizes are to be challenged, adiudged, and deliuered. And here the old Prophet and Priest of the great God Pan made a pause, and knitting to his story no conclusion; and so giuing to the Prince, little, or no satisfaction, insomuch that Adunatus awaking him with his intreaties, said; Nay, good father, leaue not my memory in this imperfect Dedalian laborinth, whence it can neither deliuer it selfe, nor giue account of the passages it hath troden: I beseech you enrich me with the knowledge of their crosse-fortunes, how vnworthily Diatassan could make chalenge to the Princesse, and what end insued to the faithfull and most miserable Thirsis . To this intreaty Eugenio returned this answere; The end of these crosse fortunes, and the winding Meanders wherein chance hath run vp and downe with an vnsteady course, I would (my faire sonne) haue thine owne eyes witnesse, whose testimony will bring a better feeling to euery part of thy charitable sence, then any relation of mine: For know, that but this euening is finished all that I haue declared, touching this last daies controuersie, which prophetickly I haue deliuered vnto thee from a diuine relation, being in euery part so true, that Truth himselfe will stand Champion to defend the iustnesse of all that I haue reported; and to morrow is the fatall day, wherein (if thou please) thou mayest behold hard-steeled Audatiousnesse , with an Adamantine and vnblushing front, so cofidently chalenge what he neuer merited, that Vertue & Wisedome will stand amazed to see coward Vntruth , in a moment, growne so admirably valiant; in which intricate worke being contained a world of strange calamities, if thy thrice-royall spirit will vouchsafe to giue a plaine solution, and plucking falshoods maske from his indirect looking-visage, shew the deceit of an vnsetled affection, thou shalt gaine the loue of the Gods, the praises of Angels, and the prayers of men: Yet thus much I must aduertise thee, that as thy selfe, a Prince of high place and dignity, thou mayest not appeare in that assembly: for the lawes are seuere, and without all fauour executed against any of dignity, or eminent ranke, that dare to enter those forbidden walkes. Besides, when you shall attaint Diatassan of his deceit, and vnfold the worthy and laborious conquest of the euer-miserable Thirsis , it will bee lawfull for Diatassan to defend his truth by a pastorall combate, to which he may call you, without further delay, or meditation. The Prince as much ouer-ioyed with the report of this aduenture, as distressed men are with the release of their afflictions, or noble spirits with the possession of new honours: told Eugenio that hee bestowed vpon him a double benefit, euerlastingly vnrequitable; first, by enriching his memory with a story so full of all the remarkeable notes of Fortunes most vnsteady gouernement in the actions of mans life, wherein both delight and pitty were so curiously and cunningly mixt together, that no time could seeme tedious which was spent in the repetition of so memorable accidets, but especially by opening so faire a path to his honour and reputation, through which they might passe to the hauen of their desires, by giuing comfort to the miserable, and taking from the most vertuous, that most deceitfull abuse of falsehood, which in after time might proue the vtter blemish of all her hopes and happy wishes. And hence he vowed to the holy Prophet, that with all carefulnesse, and the best powers both of his minde and body, he would (according to such directions and instructions as he should receiue from his wisdome) engage himselfe, not onely against Diatassan , but the whole world, which would stand forth and iustifie a falshood so strong and insufferable; in which (he said) his hopes assured his fortunes such successefull happinesse, that he doubted not but with much ease to bring to passe the effects of his desires, goodnesse not being able to endure that wrong should so cruelly tyrannize ouer vertue. Yet (said the Prince) before wee proceed any further into the resolution of this aduenture, I beseech you (if my longings be not troublesome to your memory) declare vnto me the incounter of the two Sheepheards, Thirsis and Diatassan after the conquest was obtained, and with what power of patience the victor could giue to another both his faith, his honour, and his life. Hast thou seene my sonne (quoth the old man) two contrary elements meet together with weake and consumed forces, as sparkes with drops? or the early Sunne with the moist dew? Such was the incounter of these two Swaines: for when Diatassan saw him returne with the trophy of his conquest, his ouerioyed heart so swelled with astonishment, that robbing him of all other sences, saue only his eye-sight, he became the wondring companion of a compulsatory silence, the whilst Thirsis , on the other part, beholding his executioner standing before him, to whom he must not onely deliuer vp all the garments of hopes, which had maintained him from the frozen bitternesse of an vnsatisfied despaire, but euen the deere pretiousnes of his life, which nature, by the strongest bond of bloud, had tyed him aboue all things to cherish and preserue, with a heart torne  & diuided into many peeces, by the cruell hands of loue, gratitude, faith, and his owne free promise, suddenly stood still, as if he had beheld the countenance of Medusa , or Curtius gulfe, into which one steppe more had cast him headlong. And thus these two happy vnhappy Sheepheards stood with constant vnremouing eyes, gazing one vpon the other, whilst silence holding their tongues prisoners, stood smiling to suruey the strength of their contrary passions. But griefe, which will not alwayes be bounded within limits, all-be of all passions it hath the worst vtterance, being euer more familiar with the heart, then the lips, checking his astonishment thus, made Thirsis say vnto Diatassan ; Behold (deere Sheepheard) here in my hand, the image of my loyalty and death, the first drawne from thy merit in worthily preseruing mee, most vnworthy of all preseruation: the latter from my destiny, which the Fates, as a miracle, haue throwne into the world for men to gaze and talke on, but not to be rankt with any other, how aduerse or vnfortunate soeuer. O Diatassan! constantly behold me, whilst I possesse this which I haue painfully obtained. I am (as thou seest) a man, a man of hope, a man of health, and a man of much happinesse. I haue motions in my bloud, strength in my spirits, and a will to aduance the acts of an inuiolate friendship, but being seuered and diuided, I am nothing more then exanimated earth, vselesse, respectlesse, and but in my sorrowes, eternally forgotten. Since then all the goodnesse which my life could euer couet, the blisse of my wishes, the heauen of my contentment, and the inexpressable consolations which after death should eternally make my walkes in Elizium , greene and faire flourishing, are piled vp together in this bleeding monument; and since my voluntary faith, from a well-prized consideration, thought you worthy to bee made the great maister, and true owner of them all: and since it is the will of heauen that mine owne truth shal be mine owne persecutor, hold, accept this Tygers head, which I haue kild to kill my selfe, and to giue thee that life of vnspeakable contentment, which Angels would bee proud to enioy, and the Gods themselues will enuy, because it is the greatest of all terrestriall deities. And as hee was thus speaking, amazement had such fast hold vpon Diatassan , or rather bashfulnsse, which was afraid to vsurpe vpon a right, to which it could make no possible iust claime, that it held his hands from receiuing the trophy, whose honour did nothing at all become a minde so farre short in desert and worthines. But Thirsis with more aggrauation awakned him saying; Nay, do not let pitty make thee miserable, accept it, indeed you shall accept it: why, my life is so due a rent vnto you, that in taking it, you take no more but your owne: nay, hardly all your owne: for had I many liues, they were but many tributes, and should (to auoyd more euill) bee all paid in this moment. Do not looke so sadly: for all the ioyes in the world are falne into your possession; forget me, I pray thee forget me, and henceforth remember nothing but thine owne happinesse, which is so farre from equalling, that Iupiter himselfe doth exceed thee in nothing but eternity. And here hee thrust the dart (on which the Tygers head was fastened) with such earnestnesse into his hand, that Diatassan receiuing it, began to say; Thy sorrowes, and my pitty (deere Sheepheard.) My sorrowes (said Thirsis ) interrupting the Sheepherd)  o do not mixe them with thy pitty, since they are so vtterly without bound, that no remorse hath a circumference large enough to containe them. O let them liue with themselues: for they are many degrees beyond mortall calamities, and shall serue hereafter, for Lamentations Maister-peece, by whose example hee shall modell out strange afflictions. As for my selfe I am the onely wretched caitife of the world, a man so much scorned of all creatures, that wickednesse it selfe is a subiect too good for my disdaine. I beseech thee, since my faith hath paid thee all thou didst desire, though not all thou hast deserued, suffer me to passe where I may dye, and be no more remembred; Anchor-like ingrauing my selfe so obscurely, that no gentle hand shall haue power to fixe to the same, either the teares of louing Sheepheards, or any other more charitable Epitaph. And when hee had thus said, he deliuered to Diatassan whatsoeuer had passed betwixt the Princesse and him in the chace, the manner of their contention, the doubtfulnesse of their course, their interposing one another with their darts, and all other priuate actions whatsoeuer, fortifying his remembrance with such strength of knowledge, that it was impossible for the strictest examination to disproue him, or say he was absent, who was able to giue an account much more certaine then any of those which were present. This done, and not suffering Diatassan to giue him any reply, he turned about  & departed towards the woods, and mountaines, to seeke out a place conuenient, where his life might expire. After whose foot-steps as Diatassan with much admiration gazed, he said; Go the constantest, the faithfullest, the thankfullest,  & the worthiest sheepheard which this earth supporteth, thou that hast thoughts so farre exceeding all thoughts in true worthinesse; and a vertue so good, beyond the reach of our earthly knowne goodnesse, that men can finde no excellency deseruing the dignity to be compared with thy perfections. Goe, and my prayers accompany thy safety, whilst the diuine hand of some powerfull deity may gently dew vpon thy temples, some cold Lethe to aswage the burning passions of thy true loue, and exile it into eternall obliuion. But foole that I am, what auaileth my wishes to the losse of his pretious life, which euen now is vnder the arest of a languishing destruction? Alasse! I am become vnnaturally cruell, nor shall all the Annals of tyrants, preserued from succeeding ages, equall, or come neere to the bloodinesse of my president; I do not slaughter a subiect, but a companion; not a foe to my peace, but the onely friend of my quiet; not a disturbing riuall of my loue, but the onely builder vp of mine affectious satisfaction; not he that hath robbed me of mine honour, but he that hath giuen me a renowne beyond imagination, whereby I am become vngratefull to friendship, rebellious to hospitality, a destroyer of vertue, a theefe to reputation; nay, a traytor to all goodnesse, and the onely monster that nature, or vglinesse can produce: and shall I liue to liue with these imputations? I will not, alasse I will not; my tardy feet shall bee winged to beare him backe his owne true glories, nor will I Impe my fame with feathers which are too glorious for my wings. And here, as his passion was whirle-winde-like carrying him in pursuit of the most forlorne Thirsis , selfe-loue (who in all this worke had the onely soueraignty ouer all his determinations) staid him, and compelling him to looke earnestly vpon the Tygers head, hee said; Alasse for pitty, that this toy should not onely burne and consume in me the knowledge of all mine owne goodnesse, but (committing a murther worse then sacriledge) sprinkle sad teares ouer all Thessaly. Troy , thou wert happy in thy cinders: for the brand which kindled thy flames, was the compleatnesse of all beauties; but this, which will lay waste the only glorious garden of Europe , is the grim detested visage of a man-hating monster, shall I then hold it? deere madnesse forsake mee, I will not, in truth I will not. And here he would the second time haue posted after Thirsis , but then Loue sprinkling his thoughts with new flowers, he said; And is this Tygers head all that disturbeth me, or kils the desperate sheepheard? O no, this is nothing but the plaine-fac'd monstrous obiect in a perspectiue table, through whose secret crany, if I cast my eies slope-wise, I shall then behold the beauty of all beauties, euen the day of life, and the light of mortall admiration I meane, the neuer-enough-adored Melidora : she without whom my heart can enioy no pleasure, nor my life comfort: Shall I then giue away my owne life for anothers delight, or become miserable to make another flourish, with my riches? it is both vnlawfull, and vnreasonable; charity ought to beginne in our selues, and thence to succeed to our friends, and not preposterously to pine our owne fortunes for the making vp of an others happinesse: Pardon mee Thirsis , for since thou hast thrust occasions fore-top into my hand, and giuen mee opportunity to aspire to the height of all contentment, I must and will enioy it, my pitty extending vnto thee the almes of my best wishes, but not depriuing mee of the blisse of mine excellent destiny: And with this resolution hee went into his Cabinet, where hee placed the head of the Tyger in much safety, making many prayers and orizons vnto Time, that hee would make swifter his pace, and cut short the length of the tedious night, so infinitely were his desires transported with an vnsatisfied longing for the next day. And thus (my most worthy sonne) you haue from an ill-tuned lippe heard all whatsoeuer is already passed in this doubtfull story of much worldly disaster, wherein fortune is pleased to bee so much like her selfe, both in cruelty and incertainety, that nothing can bee more memorable to make vp the perfite charracter of her Deity: as for the conclusion, or making vp of the last act in this stage-play of fortunes onely inuention, I would haue your selfe (my sonne) in it, not onely a vertuous spectator, but (when the tiranny of falshood shall adiudge truth to eternall banishment) such a worthy actor, that discouering the deuouring couetousnesse of selfe-loue, you may bring vertue backe from exile, and defend it against all the assaults of enuious mutability. To these words the Prince replyed: Sleight, and but supposed intreaties (deere father) do easily enflame a mind to pursue it's owne desires, because the strength of nature armeth our opinions that there can bee no greater goodnesse; and so in mee, whom your wisedome hath (with the feeling deliuerance of this delicate discourse) not onely stirred vp, but so firmely bound, with all willingnesse and delight, to pursue this aduenture, be well assured my desires are so strong and violent, that no occasion shall withdraw mine eies from beholding the last passage in the same; therefore I beseech you giue me such instruction, as may with the best assurance conduct me to the place where these aduentures are nourished, and doubt not but my resolution, which euer hitherto hath bene grounded vpon vertuous causes, shall so bring to passe the worthy ends of your desires, that you shall imagine your imployment nobly inferred vpon me. In that (faire Prince) answered the old man, there is neither scruple nor doubt, for thy fate hath yet an euen and well-spun thrid, which fortunes hand shall not disfigure with knots; therefore, touching thine instructions, both to the place, and in the place, know, that not farre from my Cell the way lies broad, euen, and much frequented, leading directly to those Launds where both standeth the Amphi-theater , and the Lodge of the Princesse, to this way my selfe will be your guide, and because the denial of seuere lawes will not suffer any of supreme or eminent quality, to be eie-witnesses of the least pleasure in that delightfull Garden; death, as it were, girdling it about, and defending it from all authority of greatnesse; Know, that within my Cell I haue a Sheepheards suite, comely and wel-fashioned, whose cap being with diuers foulds, made Helmet like, in such manner, that being drawne ouer the visage, no eie is able to acknowledge his most best acquaintance. In this you shall adorne your selfe (though too humble for your excellencie) and playing the part not of a rude and barberous Heardes-man, but of a wittily conceited and learned Pastor, enter into that worke which shall make your fame glorious for euer. As for your horse, armour, and other imbellishments belonging to your person, you shall leaue them heere in my Cell, where they shall abide vnder the guarde of as great safety, as if they were enclosed in the Brazen Turret of the God of Security. To these admonitions, the Prince giuing a willing and wel-pleased eare, hee told the old Prophet that his words were to him Oracles of such reuerence and dignity, that not the least tittle or hidden sence in them should either be disobeyed, or vnsatisfied, and thus eithers resolution being so well combined and married together, that Deity could discerne in them but one intire thought; the Sunne wearied with the great child-birth of delights, which proceeded from the trauell of that bigge day; whose twinnes made him wantonly neglect the swift pace of his most constant course, fearefull that Iupiter should suppose hee had found another Nymph farre excelling his Daphne , like a Meteor falling from the high heauens, hee euen in one moment descended from the Mountaines,  & nestled his head in the bosome of diuine Thetis , where shaking his danke lockes, hee restored to the earth the siluer dew which hee had suckt vp in the morning, whilst the euening, trimming vp the nights rusty Caroch, gaue warning to mens labours of her blacke appearance. This, when the Prince, and Eugenio beheld, they retired themselues into the Prophets Cell, where after they had taken a moderate repast, they coucht them downe vpon two seuerall homely (but yet most sweete) Cabens: Where the Prince, al-be there was nothing which could giue him either offence or distast, yet the calme silence of the dumbe night (which euer is a friend to disturbed and cumbersome cogitations) so clens'd from his Temples the inchanting cold, sweete dew of delightfull slumber, that his actiue and perturbed spirit, partly through his next daies exploit, but most especially for the losse of his deerest of all friends, the most excellent Thamastus , would suffer no rest to close vp the liddes of his eies, but he lay and gaue full scope to his imaginations to tyranize ouer his quiet, tumbling himselfe vp and downe, and oft changing place, though he would neuer change his perturbance, till the day, who had slept out the night in the quiet lap of the Ocean, began to lift vp his head, and ouer the tops of the highest Mountaines to take a generall suruey of halfe part of the world, which as soone as the Prince Adunatus perceiued, being wearied that he was so much weary of that, which might haue preserued him from wearinesse, arose, and in his rising gaue alarum, as it were, to the old mans rest, who abashed (that youth should giue him the president for wakefulnesse) start from his Cabin, and after accomplymentall morning salutations, they attired themselues, the old man in his ordinary and daily habits, but the Prince in his Sheepheards suite, whose homely plainenesse was so mixt with a proportionall and decent comelinesse, that it was a disputable question, whether his person (which was euer matchlesse for delicacy) or his attire were the greater ornament. As soone as the Prince was in all points attired according to the will of the old man, and had receiued his former instructions from words of stronger efficacy (signifying the dilligence of his carefulnesse) they sate downe, and did eate of those homely cates which the season of the time, and the old mans industry had prouided; which finished they issued out of the Cell, Eugenio leading the way, and the Prince in his Sheepherdish disguise, with a strong knotty Sheep-crooke in his hand, following his foote-steps till they came to that large, faire, euen, and much frequented path which leads to those pleasant Walkes where all the Sheepheards inhabited, there the old Prophet tooke his leaue of the Prince; for hee told him it would breed danger to the happinesse of the designe which so vertuously they pursued, if any eie should discouer him in his company; and therefore willing him to retaine that constant resolution, which with so much goodnesse he had begotten, and with so much honour he should perfite, he departed from the Prince, and returned backe to the holy Chappell of the God whom hee serued, where hee made many earnest, and wel- spoken orizons for the prosperous fortune, and successefull end of their vnhurtfull proiect. The Prince being left alone, and nothing to accompany him but the tedious way and his owne thoughts, both most busie intelligencers of the affaires and diuersities of fortune, being now big with child, of much longing, and many hopes, he trauelled as well with his mind as his body, till he came into those Launds, where hee not onely beheld the Sheepheards habitations, but also the Lodge of the Princesse, and the stately building of the huge Amphitheater , to which place onely he directed his steps, for he might behold many swarmes of people with an extraordinary pace flocking to the same, as though the expence of the day, or their owne slouth should bring them too late to that blest sight, which with an vnusuall violence they both pursued and desired; the notice whereof, when it had taken in the Prince a considerate impression, he, in imitation of their dilligence, made a little more then vsuall hast, so that ioyning himselfe with the presse and throng of the vulgar sort of people, he entred into the Theater vnregarded, and without any especiall notice taken of his presence; where he placed himselfe in such a conuenient roome, both for his obscurity, and publication, when the necessity of time should call him forth to the same, that neither the enuy, nor delight of any eie was troubled with his presence. The morning was as yet but yong, and in his infant weakenesse, so that neither the Iudges, Challengers, nor Challenged appeared in this great assembly, but they sate feeding their thoughts with expectations, longings, and those prophesying cogitations which are euer the companions of the eies hopes. But time, which like a man vpon high scatches can keepe any pace but standing still, ranne so swiftly post vpon the slow howres, that immediately the assembly, which were but onely the eie-ornaments of that great place, might heare the sound of many excellent loud instruments, which entring first into the Theater, their followed them in couplets all the Woodmen and Forresters belonging to those Launds, after them came a noyse of Sheepheards Bag-pipes compounded of many multitudes of Reedes, whose footesteps were pursued likewise in cooplets by all those Sheepheards who had bene actors in the former daies controuersy, and after them succeeded a consort of Rebeckes, and other more milder sounding instruments, curiously toucht by the fingers of most skilfull artizans, after whom came, in a triumphant equipage, the two worthy Sheepheards Colni and Oppicus , leading prisoner betweene them that monster and disgrace of men, the great out-law and rauisher most cruell Demagoras : Then appeared single by himselfe the vndisguised Diatassan , bearing (with an vnblushing cheeke, or any other intelligencing countenance) vpon the point of a rich Iaueling faire-guilt, veluet-bound, and gold-studded; the head of the Tiger: Next him followed two yong Sheepheards (bare-headed and in like suites of apparell) the one bearing the Princesse Bow, and the other her Quiuer; Next whom, followed her diuine person, all vayled ouer in rich Lawnes, wrought with most curious spider-works: And a pretty distance behind her came a mixture of twelue Lutes, rarely toucht by the fingers of twelue faire Virgines; then three other yong Sheepheards bare- headed, who vshered the three Iudges richly clad in roabes of crimson veluet, bordered and powdered with all manner of curious flowers, skilfully imbrodered on the same; the Nymph Apheleia being chiefe, and the two Nymphs Ethera and Cloa her cquall assistants; after them came in couplets all the Nymphs and Virgines belonging to those Walkes, and in this manner, of most Princely Pastorall solemnity, they entred into the Theater, taking their places on those rich and stately adorned Scaffolds, which were with great dilligence onely preserued for their vse and imployment: The Iudges being inthroned in the frontespice, or face of that huge round; and the Challenged and Challengers on either hand of their state  & magnificence; All which orderly & court-like proceeding, when the Princely Adunatus beheld he was stricken into an admiration beyond wonder, his minde easily perswaded to beleeue, that the first state and pompe of greatnesse was borrowed from these humble manner of people, no rule in Heraldry being able to marshall a troupe with greater dignity and splendor. Now when euery creature was set in silent admiration of what would insue from this great wombe of perfect wonder, no sence supposing that any crosse-fortune could cloud the sun-shine of their delights, there was solemnly made, with a most audible voice ouer the whole Theater, a distinct and wel-deliuered Proclamation, for a generall silence; and then was read the commission from the Princesse, declaring her free consent, and absolute resignation of all her perticular authority into the hands of those well-elected Iudges there present, and the strong couenant wherein she had bound herselfe, without all euasions, to yeeld and humble her person to bee wholly disposed by their censures; her great name, place, and most supreame soueraignty being freely giuen vp to the customes of their pastorall lawes, and the chance of such fortune as should that day attend vpon her. And this being read, there was a second proclamatio made, commanding all such persons as could, by vertue of that writ, or any other accident happened in the former daies controuersie, make any chalenge to the prizes there extant, to stand forth and make his chalenge, and hee should receiue all indifferent hearing, and iustice. The last of this proclamation was hardly departed from the proclaimers lips, when the courtly Sheepheard Diatassan arose, and with his grim Trophy in his hand, placing himselfe before the faces of the Iudges, after solemne reuerence (as dissimulation neuer wanteth any inchanting garbe that may breede contentment) he thus spake vnto them. You sacred and well-elected Iudges of the great workes of the last great day, whose euen and direct eyes are neuer turned from the obiect of diuine equity; if the liberall land of man-aduancing Fortune, hath, from the true regard of my loyalty, and the vnfeigned zeale of my faith, which euer hath preserued in me a seruiceable affection (vnmatchable by any others imitation) bestowed vpon mine humble seruices, that rich and vnspeakable dignity which none but deity it selfe can iustly presume to merit: or if my painefull actions in the last dayes trauell, of which, not onely this bleeding Trophy, but the generall eyes of the most part of this assembly, are direct and vnfained witnesses, haue made mee powerfully worthy to chalenge the greatest blessing that this earth containeth; a fate so farre beyond the circuit of my hopes (though euer anext to my wishes) that my humble spirit yet trembleth to demand the faire gift of my destiny: then to your most worthy iudgements I appeale, and craue that iustice which belongeth to my fortune, which is the most blissefull interest in this all-excelling great Ladies seruice; at whose feet, in all humility, I lay downe this ensigne of my conquest, and with it my true heart, armed with so great zeale, and deuoute adoration to her vertues, that neither time nor death shall weare out the truth of mine affection. When hee had thus spoken, the Nymph Apheleia standing vp, made this reply to her sheepheard. Faire and renowned yong man, whose actiue excellency hath aduanced thine admiration farre beyond all thy companions, and set thee vp in the highest throne of euery creatures affection, making thy praises run vpon mens tongues, through euery corner of the world; because (as I suppose) thy contention was onely to shew thy vertue, not to retaine any benefite contained in the proclamation, more then an honourable power to bestow thy purchase backe, whence it was lost; From the rarenesse of which action, men shall renowne thy bounty, setting Hercules pillars vpon thy fortune, and forbidding the whole world to goe any further in the act of Iustice and Goodnesse. Know then, that since election hath made me the Instrument to giue sentence in this alltogether vndoubtfull atchieuement, I can doe no lesse then giue you what you haue most worthily wonne. Onely one taske our commission bindeth vs to impose vpon you, which I feare me (faire Sheepheard) is a labour too hard for your faith. You must, here, before the face of this great assembly, with all plainnesse of spirit, and auoyding the damned craft of mentall reseruation, abiure, and renounce all forraigne loues and affections, assuring vs by your solemne vowes, contained in most effectuall protestations, that your minde is cleere and free from all deuotion and seruice to any Nymph, except her alone, whom you haue gained by this most worthy conquest. To this the Sheepheard thus replyed; You haue (faire Nymph) imposed on mee a taske so facile and easie, that I shall quickly passe through the same without any perturbance: for here, in the sight of heauen, and this famous pastorall assembly, I vow. At this word the Nymph Apheleia interrupted him, saying; Sheepheard what wilt thou vow? O bee mindfull of thy vertue, and doe not wilfully run into damn'd periury. But Diatassan replyed, I am resolued, nor shall euer my faith wauer, or remoue from a resolution grounded vpon so much excellency. Heare me then you Iudges, and you people: for here I vow by the great Deity of Minerua , by our holy Saboths, and those chaste pleasures which makes our liues admired in all places, that on earth I reuerence, adore, and with sacred and chaste thoughts loue no Nymph but this diuine Lady. Neither is my faith inchained, nor hath my lippes giuen my heart to any, but onely her seruice; In which my desires are, that I may consummate my life, though a tribute much too humble for her worthinesse. Neuer did tongue deliuer deeper falshoods (cryed out the Nymph Apheleia ) and with that, throwing her rich robe from her shoulders, shee descended from her high throne, and placing her lookes in iust opposition with the eyes of Diatassan , she said; Periur'd and disloyall man, thou which makest a common mart of loue, exchanging thy faith for euery gaud, and spangle, which doth but adorne a womans countenance: behold here, before these Iudges and people, I accuse thee of periury to my selfe, treason to this faire Princesse, and of generall disgrace to all chaste and noble affection. Heare me you Iudges, I beseech you: This man (the blemish of mankinde) first in Minerua's Temple, and in the hower of Orizons and Sacrifice, with as strong protestations as a violent loue could beget from a braine inflamed with a restlesse desire, he made tender vnto me of all his faith, his zeale, and his purest affection; vowing that but my selfe, he neuer beheld the Nymph whose eye had power to fixe any fetter of liking in his bosome: to which Circean charme, when I had vnfortunately lent my (then too easie) eare, hee, with all earnestnesse, so greedily pursued the weaknesse of my beliefe, that againe, at Minerua's Fountaine renewing his oathes (for which heauens pardon him) hee so amplifies his solicitation of loue; that abiuring all happinesse whensoeuer he should bee found recreant, or in the least imaginary sence, giue cause of doubt in his constancy, hee wonne from mee a chast consent of honourable affection; which vnfortunatly there I sealed, by the gift of a curious Iewell, which either he still possesseth, or negligently hath consumed; and now, with a Mauritanian ocuntenance, sunne- burnt, and made blacke with the burning sinne of his falshood, hee shameth not onely to deny the act of his owne lippes, but, to the great disgrace of all Sheepheards, makes holy vowes of no reputation; which if it shall finde sufferance in your iustice, or that no law be found penall for such inhumane deceit, then let your Temples bee still prophaned with such Idols, let your greene walkes wither with the foot-steps of vnworthy creatures, and make your selues mistresses of nothing but calumny, and imputation. This speech, deliuered by the Nymph, with many abruptions of sighes and teares, wonne a feeling remorse in all the assembly, Diatassan onely excepted, whose heart being fixed vpon another obiect, had no place left wherein to retaine any pitty; and to approue that the vse of sinne makes men sinne with more easinesse, hauing now entred himselfe within the lists of disgrace and falshood (shame arming him against shame) hee will, in despight of all oppositions, run through the worst of loues iniuries; and therefore, with a cheeke much more vnblushing then before, he thus spake to the Iudges: Faire Nymphes, within whose lippes my life consisteth, I take this day to be elected, not for the examination of old loues, coupled to much dotage, nor for the expence of Idle howers, fild full of our vanities; but to adiudge, in truth and vprightnesse, the deserts of euery mans fortune in this last dayes controuersie: which if it be so, I beseech you, let not the blemish which this too-much-louing maid inflicteth on my neuer-stained faith, take vp any place in your eares, but according to the pastorall lawes, and customes of these faire walkes, let mee receiue that iust sentence which belongeth both to mine actions and painfull seruice; and so much the rather, in that by my former abiuration, I haue made it cleere, that my faith standeth free, and vn-intangled with any forreigne affection. To this the Nymph Cloa made answere, It is true, Sheepheard, this is not a day to giue balme to any old vlcers, our Commission beeing created to another particular purpose: Yet thus much let mee assure thee, If thou shalt bee found of that mutability of spirit, to make a pastime in the abuse of pure virgins, the lawes of Minerua will lye heauy vpon thee, and thou shalt bee bound to answere thy deceit, whensoeuer the iniured shall be pleased to call thee. And when she had thus said, she turned herselfe to the Nymph Apheleia , and besought her, (since neither the time, place, nor strength of their Commission, could giue her wrongs satisfaction) to assume againe her place, and finish the work of their election; which shee obeying, in her passage to her throne, she presently said thus to the shepheard; cruellest of men, why me, aboue others, hast thou made the shame of thy disdaine? Blush, repent, be not damned for euer; and so againe adorning herselfe in her robe of State, shee sate downe, and intreated the Nymph Cloa to deliuer the sentence, for her lippes should neuer doe so worthy a Princesse wrong, to adiudge her a seruant swolne so monstrous bigge with all indignity. The Nymph obeying her request, commanded Diatassan and the Princesse both to stand forth, and then charged him by the faith and loyalty of a true Sheepheard, to declare, if according to the Articles contained in the proclamation, he had, without the assistance of Charme, or Inchantment, the strength of any other arme, or the deceit of aduantage, not onely ouer-run the Princesse in the Chace, but also slaine that fierce beast before shee could fasten any dart in his skinne. To which, with a great oath, hee replyed, that himselfe, and no other creature, but his particular person, without all aduantage, or deceit, had slaine the Tyger in such ample manner as the proclamation required: to which, as he was calling Melidora herselfe for a testimony, the most Princely Adunatus , rising suddenly fro his seat, and clapping his hand on the shoulder of Diatassan , hee said; Sheepheard, thou hast lyed before this vertuous assembly, as deepe as hell: for it was neither thine arme nor foot which was guilty of the conquest against this vertuous Princesse, but the vnfortunate power of the euer-truly louing Thirsis , who, armed in thy disguise, conquered, and gaue thee the conquest, which with such ostentation thou most vntruly boasteth; And here he deliuered vnto the Iudges, at large, the manner of Thirsis deliuery from the Inchanter, and all other passages betweene them, till that present; which he offered there to iustifie with his life, and the losse of the best bloud he enioyed. Which assertion, and vnexpected accusation, vttered so suddenly from a Sheepheard, whose tongue, nor person, no man knew, nor could challenge, draue all the assembly into so strange an amazement, that the generall murmure, which sounded ouer all the house, was so great, (though no words could be distinguished) that the Iudges were forc'd (a while) to stay in their proceedings, the most giuing credit to the report of the yong Sheepheard, though some few supposed it to be a stratagem of enuies inuention; but no mans wonder could be copared to Diatassans , who hearing his secret thoughts publickly vnfolded, imagined some spirit was risen from Limbo to detect the iniustice of his actions, but being armed with his former resolution, and hauing waded to the waste in his iniquity, willing now to step vp to the chinne ere any reuolt should doe him shame, he, with a mind as ful of desperation as affection, made answere to the strange Sheepheard, that his mouth was full of slander, and his heart of mallice: for greater vntruths could not proceed from falshood himselfe then were those accusations, which he most vniustly, and from a villanous nature imposed vpon him, which he swore he would make him confesse, vnder the fatall power of his reuenging arme; and with that falling vpon his knees he besought the Iudges to grant him the benefit of their antient Lawes, which was, by a Pastorall combat with Sheepheards-crookes to approue his truth and vnstained fidelity: But scarcely were his knees bended, when the Prince Adunatus likewise bowed his to the ground, and made humble petition for the selfe-same fauour; but whilst they were vpon the ground, intreating for that which must, of force, be one of their confusions, there entred into the Theater another disguised Sheepheard, whose face being concealed not any could fixe acquaintance to his person: Before him went a Sheepheards boy, bearing in his hand a strong  & wel-knotted Sheephook, who as soone as hee was arriued before the Iudges, by the mouth of the boy hee deliuered these speeches. Faire Virgines, and the elected mouthes of Iustice and wisedome; vertue, was neuer without enuy, nor is there any scale to aduancement without danger, as appeareth by the controuersy of these two Sheepheards, the one falsly accusing, the other falsely accused; For this Sheepheard will heere approue by the strength of his arme, and the vse of this weapon, that all which this strange Sheepheard hath spoken is false, and onely from malice inuented; neither can you in iustice refuse his appeale, for these many reasons: First, there is no equality that hee, whose dignity and merite is knowne and assured, should hazard the greatnesse of his fortune, vpon one, whose obscurity can giue no assurance of any worth; Next, the title and assertion he defendeth belongeth to another and not to himselfe; so that being but anothers Champion, it is reasonable that this worthy Sheepeheard enioy the like fauour, which my Maister likewise a stranger, equall in euery merite (till further knowledge approue the contrary) is willing to vnder-go, desiring that Diatassan may bee discharged, and his fortune made the arbitrator of this doubtfulnesse. The Iudges demanded of Diatassan if hee would consent to this request? and he, whose owne selfe-guiltinesse, was worse then the sword of any publicke enemy, said. That the consideration of the reasons before rehearsed, and not to dis-regard any benefite sent from the hand of fortune, made him will to consent that the tryall of his truth should depend vpon the fortune of this his vnknowne friend: But Adunatus said, let them both bee ioyned in the battle, for I am so safely guarded with sincere and religious truth that a whole Army cannot affright mee; After which wordes the combat was granted, onely betweene the two strange Sheepheards, whom, after Melio and Amintas had searcht, and assured from all matter of aduantage, and taken both measure and suruey of their Sheep-hookes, they were brought into a place, which euer was preserued in the Theater, for such purposes, and onely sixe Sticklers to effect the will and commandements of the Iudges; and the loud instruments sounding a martiall flourish, they assayled one another with such vnspeakeable violence that the God of Warre might haue learnt much skil from their furies: The battle was fierce, tedious, and doubtfull, death houering equally betweene them, yet not much affected to either of their fortunes; in the end, each of them ashamed of their owne weakenesse, and possest with thoughts of one creation, which enuied the losse of so much time, turning their staues aboue their heads, they let them fall on each other with such heauy poise, that like the ruines of a falling Tower, they threatned destruction to all they touched; but with the actiue nymblenesse of their deliuer spirits they auoided that storme, and closing themselues body to body their grew a new combat betweene their feete as fierce as that of their hands, seeking by artificiall trippes to bring each other to the ground; which, when neither by any industry preuailed, they flew backe againe to the vse of their weapons, and in that retrait, striking at each other, the blowes were not so well defended but that they tooke off both their cappes, and left their faces naked and bare to the veiw of the whole assembly, so that Adunatus knew his aduersary, whom all those people had euer acknowledged for the incomparable best-louing Sheepheard, renowned Thirsis , to bee his onely best of friends, the most Princely Thamastus , in whose search hee had vowed to consume the whole substance of his life; and Thamastus , who so long had liued in those Walkes knowne onely by the name of Thrisis , knew that his aduersary Adunatus , was the most excellent Prince Pyrophilus , to whose loue his life was linkt in such euerlasting bonds, that no ioy on earth could equall the delight of his presence: and now beholding each others face, they suddainely fell downe vpon both their knees, Pyrophilus offering to yeeld his weapon vp to Thamastus , and Thamastus as earnest to resigne his to Pyrophilus , both, in this conquest, willing to be conquered, and neither content to rise as a victor, Which accident, driuing all the people into a strange amazement, one of the Stickleres was commanded to demand of them which was the victor, and they both with one voyce replyed, hee, and hee, and then throwing their weapons from them, they ranne and embraced each other, with so much loue that friendship neuer bare a better countenance then at present; and the Stickler informed the Iudges that they both were ouer-come, yet neither conquered, at which euery creeature reioysed, because their actions shewed them to be creatures of heroycall Spirits, but aboue all their ioyes exceeded at the sight of Thirsis , as well for the tender affection they bore to his presence, as also in that his knowledge was able to resolue that doubt, which yet stucke most strongly in the breasts of that assembly, and here-vpon the Iudges coniured Thirsis , by all his owne vertues, and by that loue which with such faithfulnesse he bore to the Princesse, to declare if he were any actor in the former daies controuersy; and he made answere no, for his dispaire had long-since chidden from him all such hope, and that it was most assured, there was no other true victor then the best-deseruing Diatassan : This protestation, gaue euery one, but the Princesse, and Adunatus , a full satisfaction: And now were Diatassans hopes once more gotten vp to the high top-gallant of his ambition, and he beganne, as busily as before, to craue the sentence due to his merite. But Oppicus and Colin , stepping forth, (because the day began to grow a little aged) and besought the Iudges, before they proceeded to any other sentence first to giue doome vpon that wickedest of all creatures, that Theefe, and most lustfull rauisher of Virgines, the euer-feared Demagoras , whom in their pursuite of the chase, they had found ambuscadoed to take aduantage of euery weake fortune, with whom hauing held a long and tedious fight, in the end, through their double force they tooke prisoner, and there deliuered vp to the iudgement of their Lawes, which said: Minerua's lawes were forth-with read to the prisoner, who pleaded guilty to all, and accursing his bad fortune that it was culpable of no more euill, vowed that if his raigne had longer continued he would haue made all Thessaly haue quakt with the report of his cruelties, vpon which desperate and diuelish protestation, the Nymph Apheleia gaue sentence, that hee should immediately bee bound to a stake (there erected in that Theater for such like executions) and so shot to death with the arrowes of Sheepheards, Which execution, being forth-with put in practise, and the prisoner standing bound to the mercy of his death; hee besought the Sheepheards, before they discharged their arrowes in his bosome, to giue attentiue eare vnto his last speech; and they by their silence let him vnderstand that they gaue consent to his desire, so that lifting his voyce on high, he thus spake vnto them. Know you Thesalians to whose powers, and not trespasses, my life is forfeited, that it is not your sleight crimes, sheepish pillages, nor the disburdening of a few too-long borne Mayden-heads, (by your Language called rauishments) for which I die; no, my damnation was long since created, and the crying sinne which hath inuokt the Gods to lay this shame on my fortune, was an act so monstrous and barbarous, that a hunger-sterued Tyger would not haue presumed vpon so huge a cruelty. Know then that I was borne in the Kingdome of Dalmatia , where whilst I liued, accompanied with any vertue, I was a Duke, and Gouernour of a faire Prouince, my name Astense ; And here hee made a pause. Whilst the Nymph Apheleia , starting from her seate, beganne to gaze strangely about her, and to fixe her eares to his words with a more earnest attention; then he proceeded. In this Kingdome of Dalmatia , there raigned a King of infinite wisedome and prowesse, approued both by his conquests and peacefull gouernement: the one keeping in awe his neighbours, the other making rich his subiects: This King was blest with one onely most excellent daughter, whose rauishing beauty had so inflamed my heart, with all the burning torches of loue, that nothing was plenteous in my thoughts but onely the memory of her excellencies, but this loue of mine was soone made desperate by the arriuall of the yong Prince of Sicil , who hauing formerly negotiated a marriage, the articles were soone concluded on both parties; so that heere vertue began to forsake mee, and from hence iealousy, frenzy, and enuy, stirred vp in my soule all the vnspeakeable mischiefes which euer were accurst by good people: And finding that my loue was vtterly without hope, I now studied how to make the world and men as voide of all comfort, so it chanced, that on a day comming into the presence of the yong Princesse, I found her in chast and noble daliance with the yong Prince her troth-plight seruant, at whose happinesse, my enuy so much repined, that drawing forth a strong and most impoysoned fume (which I euer carried about mee) I cast it vpon her face, whose contagious working was so violent, that shee instantly died in the armes of her deere loued Lord and admirer, with whose breath, her soule flying forth, it carried from the earth, all beauty, all vertue, all excellency, all goodnesse; as for my selfe, whose damned act euen the diuels themselues did repine at, I presently fled and came into these Walkes, which being most famous for all manner of peacefull happinesse, I vowed to make most desolate and accursed, through my tiranny, cruelty, and iniury, and heere againe hee made a great pause. The while the Nymph Apheleia , whose passion could no longer smother her speeches, demanded of the dying man, what was the name of her, whom he so impoysoned? And he answered, that her name was Clarastella , Shee then demanded the name of the Prince of Sicil ? And he replyed, Eustatio : And what (said she) became of the Prince after the death of his infortunate Lady? Report (replyed Demagoras ) bruted, that hee ranne to the toppes of the Mountaines, and thence threw him selfe head-long into the Seas. But hee had scarcely pronounced his last word, when Diatassan , no longer able to imprison his fury, rusht thorough the throng, and comming neerer the prisoner, hee said; Monster of men, and the vtter detestation of thy mothers wombe, know that Eustatio is not dead, but liues to take a deeper reuenge of thine vnnaturall cruelty: for euen my selfe am that once vnfortunate Prince, who being exiled from all ioy, by the tyranny of thy malice; after I had caused rumour to blazon my death, (that pursuit might not hinder my purpose) I came into these walks, where, in a Sheepheards coat, I vow to consume the remnant of my dayes in vaste sollitude. And then turning to the Iudges, he besought them, that himselfe might adde torments to his death, who had annext endlesse calamities to his life. But the Nymph Apheleia replied, that it was contrary to their lawes, which beeing grounded vpon pitty and commisseration, rather affoorded ease then agony to the afflicted: and so (said she) for mine owne part, I will giue his departing soule some satisfaction, and dis-burden it of that with which it appeares to bee most crucified. And then turning her speeches to the prisoner, shee said; My Lord Astense , I beseech you repent your last crimes: for touching your great trespasse, of which you seeme to retaine the greatest feeling, I thus purge you: Know that I am that Clara-Stella which your enuy seeking to destroy the dumbe poyson, much more merciful then your malice, wrought not his effects so strongly as to take away my life, but onely brought mee to a dead sleepe, which time banishing from my sences, I returned to my former knowledge; But missing him, whose Image onely was ingrauen vpon my heart, I fledde in disguise from the Court, and came into Tempe , where I vowed the expence of my life in the seruice of the Gods, and the chaste delights of modest virgins. And hauing thus spoken, Diatassan fell vpon his knees to the ground, and humbly besought her to pardon him, for in her alone was confined all his true loue, and all his most faithfull affection. But shee told him; shee durst not giue credit where shee had found so much strange inconstancy; neither was it possible that hee could leaue his new desires for his old promises. But hee replyed; as Diatassan , hee was subiect to much mutability; but as Eustatio , hee was euer constant, and neuer desired other glory then his deerest Clarastella ; which I will witnesse by this action: And then taking Thirsis by the hand, hee presented him to the Princesse, with a publique confession of all truthes, in such manner as the Prince Adunatus had formerly declared. A ioy so full of all contentment and delight to the Princesse, that her dead spirits being awakned out of a sorrowfull lethargie, began to daunce Leualto's in her bosome; and shee enquired of Thirsis what that strange Sheepheard was, who had so vertuously entred into the Combate, and with such admiration left it most happily perfect, with a blest imperfection. And he delared vnto her, that he was his owne naturall brother, borne in Arcadia , who stirred vp, with the report of those triumphes, was come onely to behold an end of their proceedings. Vpon which report the Princesse gaue him a most intire and gracious welcome; and then congratulating the prosperous and most happy meeting of the Princesse of Dalmatia , and the Prince of Sicil (whom their lawes could not touch, through the eternity of their vowes) she tendred vnto them all the fauours whatsoeuer Tempe enioyed: and they only besought her, since that blissefull day had brought vnto them all the ioyes of their wishes, that she would be pleased to pardon the condemned Duke, whom they intended to take from those walkes, and plant in his former greatnesse. To which the Princesse gaue ample consent: and so the prisoner being vnbound; Clarastella , as she was Apheleia , ascended once more her throne, and gaue this iudgement of the prizes. First, that Thirsis should enioy the free gift of the Princesse: Next, that Diatassan , in as much as his picture and likenesse had wonne the honour and glory of the day, that hee should enioy the picture of the Princesse. Then, that Oppicus , who had first entred into combate with Demagoras , should enioy the rich garland. And lastly, that Colin , by whose prowesse and seconds the Out-law was taken; and so
