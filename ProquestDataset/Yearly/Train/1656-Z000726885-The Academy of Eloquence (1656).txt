 So likewise no clearness nor perfection in that Fancy, which delivers it self by a confus'd abortion. Great is the disparagement which flows from the defailance of the Tongue: it not only dishonours the person of the Speaker, but even sullys the opinion of his reason and judgement with a disrepute, and oft-times renders the very truth suspected. If then it so befall our verball expressions, which are transient and less lyable to censure and where one hansome expression may excuse a number of soloecismes; how shall that person be esteem'd prudent, whose pen layes him wide open in a fungous and sordid stile; how shall we expect ingenuity from him, whose leisure and Genius, assisted with the examen of his eyes, yeild us no spirit in his writing ? He that has worth in him and cannot express it, is a Cabinet keeping a rich Jewell, and the key lost, sayes a modern Author; whereas a good stile, with choise matter and embroidery of well chosen words, is like a beautifull Woman with a virtuous Soul, who attracts the eyes and charmes the hearts of all beholders. This excellent faculty of speech ha's bin in high esteem even from the very infancy, &will be to the end of the World; For in sacred Story 1 we read , the wise in Heart shall be called prudent, and the sweetness of the lips increaseth understanding: Pleasant words are as an honycomb; sweet to the soul and health to the bones. Hence 'twas, an ancient Author maintained, that Pericles ( the Orator ) was no less Tyrant in Athens then Pysistratus, without acknowledging other difference, then that this exercis'd his Empire armed, the other without armes, by the sole terror of his speech, which Aristophanes compar'd to a thunder-bolt, as Homer did that of Vlysses to a Torrent that beares down all with its violence. And 'twas said of old, that the tongue of Cyheas ( the fam'd Scholler of Demosthenes) conquer'd more Cities, then the sword of Pyrrhus, the valiant King of Epire. To have said thus much, of the much more might be added in behalf of this charming Faculty, and of the disadvantage commonly attending those who are unskill'd in it, may serve as an inducement to the youth of both Sexes (for whose benefit this little Work is chiefly intended, and to their acceptance consecrated) to make the perusall of it their subservient Recreation for vacant houres; this with little study, will not only facilitate your discours into the moding language of these times but adapt your pens too with a quaint &fluent stile then which no qualities (with confidence I speak it) can render you more accomplish'd. Here shall you be furnisht with all necessary materialls and helps in order to the acquiring so great a treasure; such helps as have bin advised and often wisht for, but never before published. I. The first part containes a more exact English Rhetorique, then has been hitherto extant, comprehending all the most usefull Figures, exemplifi'd out of the Arcadia and other our choisest Authors. II. In the second part, you have formul ae majores or Common-places, upon the most usual subjects for stile and speech; The use and advantage whereof is asserted by my Lord Bacon, who (in his Advancement of learning) sayes thus ; I hold the diligence and pain in collecting Common-places to be of great use and certainty in studying: as, that which aids the memory, subministers copy to invention, and contracts the sight of judgement to a strength. III. In the third place you shall find Formul ae minores ( as my Lord calls them ) lesser formes, which he then reckon'd among the defects in our Language, and sayes they are as it were, the Portals and postern dores of stile and speech, and of no smal use. IV. Lastly you have a Collection of Letters and addresses written to, for, and by severall persons, upon emergent occasions; with some particular Instructions and Rules premised for the better attaining to a Pen-perfection. The Formula's are but Analects, which like the Humble-bee I gather'd in Spring time out of the choisest Flowers of our English Garden; nor have I in the Rhetorick or Letters transplanted much from my own barren Seminary; I may say to some noble Correspondents, what the Poet did of old in a like Case , sic vos non vobis--- But, you will easily distinguish Tinsill from better mettal: What is mine will appear to be so, by the Bluntismes that frequently occur; the rest are of better allay. So that if the defects of my own Essays be but pardoned, the rest, I am confident, will abide the touch, and, pass for Sterling. T. B. of Speech and Stile, as Barbarisms and Solecismes are the vices; we shall then begin with A METAPHOR or Translation which is the friendly and neighbourly borrowing a word, to express a thing with more light and better note, though not so directly and properly as the natural name of the thing meant, would signifie. As to say, Drops of Dew are Pearls; Flowers in Meadows are Starres , and the murmuring of waters, Musick ; that little Birds are Angels of the Forests; Whales are living Rocks , or ships with souls; that the Sea is a moving Earth , and fountain water, liquid Crystal . And in expressing Desirous ; a kind of Desire , is thirst , and not much different from thirst is hunger ; Therefore for swords desirous of blood , Sir Philip Sidney says, hungry of blood . Where you may note three degrees of a Metaphor in the understanding; First, the fitness to bloodshed in a weapon usurps the name of, Desirous which is proper to living Creature, and then that it proceeds to thirst , and so to hunger. The Rule of a Metaphor is, that it be not too bold not too farfetch'd; And though all Metaphors go beyond the true signification of things, yet are they requisite to express the roving fancies of mens minds, which are not content to fix themselves upon one thing intended, but must wander to the confines; Like the eye that cannot chuse but view the whole knot, when it purposely beholds but one flower in the Garden; Or like an Archer , that knowing his Bow will overcast or carry short, takes aim on this side or beyond the mark. Besides, a Metaphor is pleasant, because it enriches our knowledge with two things at once, the Truth and a Similitude ; As this, Heads disinherited of their naturall Seigniories , whereby we understand both beheading , and the government of the head over the body, as the heir has over the Lordship, which he inherits; Of which in another place, To divorce the fair marriage of the Head and Body ; where, besides the cutting off the head, we understand the conjunction of the head and body to resemble a marriage . The like in concealing love, uttered in these words, To keep love close Prisoner-There came, along the street a whole fleet of Coaches , for a great number. Longinius sayes Metaphors and exchanges of words, are of excellent use and much conducing to height in Eloquence. An Allegory is the continuall prosecuting a Metaphor , (which before I defin'd to be, a translation of a word,) and that proportionably through the whole sentence, or through many sentences; As Philoclea was so invironed with sweet Rivers of vertue, that she could neither be battered nor undermined : Where Philoclea is expressed by the similitude of a Castle ; her naturall defence, by the naturall fortification of Rivers about a Castle; and the Metaphor continues in the attempting her by force or craft, expressed by battering or undermining . Another, But when she had once his Ensign in her mind, then followed whole squadrons of longings, that so it might be with a main battel of mislikings and repinings against their Creation ; where you have Ensigns, Squadrons, main Battles ; Metaphors still derived from the same thing. i. War. As I said before, a Metaphor might be too bold, or too far fetch'd, so I now remember it may be too base, and too bald a translation; As the Tempest of judgment had broken the main mast of his will. A goodly Audience of sheep, Souldiers of friendship , or such like. Too base , as in that speech, Fritter of fraud, and seething pot of iniquity . And they that say, A Red herring is a shooing horn to a pot of Ale . But if you speak of a disdainful matter, you may use the grosser terms. Therefore for general delight, take your expressions from ingenious Arts and Professions, to please the learned in several kinds; As from the Meteors, Plants, Beasts in natural Philosophy ; And from the Starres, Spheres and their motions in Astronomy ; from the better part of Husbandry; from politick government of Cities; from Navigation , from the military profession, from Physick ; but not out of the depth of those mysteries; And (unless your purpose be to disparage) let the word be always taken from a thing of equal or greater dignity, As speaking of Vertue , T he skie of your vertue overcast with sorrow , where 'twas thought unfit to stoop to any Metaphor , lower then the Heaven. An Embleme , an Allegory, a Simile, a Fable, a Poetical Fiction differs thus. An Embleme is but one part of the Similitude in the body, and the other part under application in the words; An Allegory is the similitude of the application exprest indifferently, and joyned in one sentence with words, some proper to one part, some to another; A Simile hath two sentences of several proper terms compared. A Fable is a Simile acted by Fictions in Beasts; A Poets Tale , for the most part by Gods and Men. In the former example, Paint a Castle, compast with Rivers, and let the Motto be NEC OBSIDIONE NEC CUNICULIS, Neither by siege nor undermining , that is an Embleme . Lay it as it is in Sir Philips Philoclea; Vertue, environed, Rivers, battering, undermining , the terms of the other part; Put all these terms in one sentence, and it is an Allegory ; But let it be thus, There was a Lamb in a Castle, and an Elephant and a Fox besieged her; The Elephant would have assaulted her, but he could not swim over the River; the Fox would make an earth to get under her, but he feared the River would sink in upon him and drown him ; then it is a Fable . Let Spencer tell you such a Tale of a Fairy Queen , or Ovid of Danae , and 'tis a Poetical Fiction : But utter it thus in one sentence, As a Castle compassed about with rivers, cannot be battered or undermined . And thus in another, So Philoclea defended round about with vertuous resolution, could neither be forced nor surprized by deceit ; Then it is a Similitude in its own nature, which is the ground of all Emblemes, Allegories, Fables and Fictions. METONYMIA is the exchange of a name, when one word comes in lieu of another, not for a similitude, but for other natural affinity and co-herence, As, when the matter is used for that which consists thereof; I want-silver, for money. When the efficient or author is used for the thing made; As, my Blade is right Sebastian ; for, of Sebastians making . The thing containing, for the thing or person contained; As, the City met the General , for the Citizens . The adjunct, property, or quality, for the subject of it; As, desarts are preferred , for men deserving. Take heed young idleness ; for, idle youth. Give room to the quoif , for, the Serjeant ; with the like. SYNECDOCHE is an exchange of the name of the part for the whole, or of the name of the whole for the part. There are two kindes of total comprehensions; An entire body, or a general name; As, my name is tossed and censured by many tongues , for, many men ; where the part of an intire body goes for the whole. Contrariwise he carries a Goldsmiths shop on his fingers , for Rings. He fell into the water and swallowed the Thames , for the water . So the general name for the special; Put up your weapon , for your Dagger . And the special, for the particular; As, the Admiral is gone to sea , for Admiral Blague : The particular for the special. As, I would willingly make you a Sir Philip Sidney , for, an eloquent, learned, valiant Gentleman ; or for many; as, the Hollander they say comes against us , for the Hollanders , and such like, which (because they are easie) I have exemplified familiarly. Both these figures serve well, when you have mentioned something before, that may require Variety in repetition. CATACHRESIS, in English, Abuse , is now grown in fashion, as most abuses are; It is somewhat more desperate then a Metaphor ; And is the expressing of one matter by the name of another, which is incompatible with, and sometimes clean contrary to it; As, I gave order to some servants of mine, (whom I thought as apt for such charities as my self) to lead him out into a Forrest, and there kill him ; where Charity is used for Cruelty . But this may also be by the Figure IRONIA. The abuse of a word drawn from things far differing; As, a voyce beautiful to his eares. Accusing in himself no great trouble in mind by his behaviour or action. Do you grudge me part of your sorrow, being sister in nature? I would I were not so far off a Kin in fortune . This is a usuall figure with the fine conversants of our time, when they strain for extraordinary expressions; As, I am in danger of preferment. I am not guilty of those praises. I have hardly escaped good fortune. He threatens me a good turn . All by the contrary. And as he said that misliked a picture with a crooked Nose. The elbow of his Nose is disproportionable. The ear is not onely pleased with store and variety of words, but takes great delight in the repetition of the same words; which, because they may be at the beginning, middle, end, and in sundry correspondencies of each of these places one to another; it happens, that it has purchased severall names of Figures; As Repetition of the same word or sound immediatly without interposition of any other, is called EPIZEUXIS. O let not, let not from you be poured upon me destruction. Tormented, tormented? torment of my soul , Philoclea tormented . This figure is not to be used but in passion. AN ADIPLOSIS is a repetition in the end of a former sentence, and beginning of the next; As, you fear lest you should offend; offend, O how know you that you should offend? Because she doth deny, deny? now in earnest I could laugh, &c. Why loved I? alas, alas, why loved I? to die wretched, and to be the example of the heavens hate; and hate, spare not; for your worst blow is given.---From whom they have commonly such respect, and respect soon opens the door to perswasion, &c. This figure is often and handsomly used by Sir William Davenant in his Preface to Gondihert . And as no man strikes in thought upon any thing, but for some vehemency or distrust, so in speech there is no repetition without importance. CLIMAX is a kinde of ANADIPLOSIS, by degrees making the last word a step to a furthermeaning. If it be turned to an argument, it is a SORITES; A young man of great beauty, beautified with great honor, honored with great valor. You could not enjoy your goods, without government, no Government without a Magistrate, no Magistrate without obedience, and no obedience, where every one upon his private passion interprets the Rulers actions. Now to make it a SORITES or climing argument, joyn the first and last with an ERGO. As ERGO you cannot enjoy your own goods, where every man upon his own private passions doth, &c. This, in a penned speech, is too Academical, but in discourse more passable and plausible. Seeing to like, liking to love, loving to, &c. Deceived me, after deceit abused me, after abuse forsaken me. What doth better become wisdom then to discern what is worthy loving? What more agreeable to goodness then to love it, so discerned? and what to greatness of heart, then to be constant in it once loved ? Where the last word or some one word in the last sentence begets the next clause. This Figure hath his time, when you are well entred into discourse, have procured attention, mean to rise and amplifie. ANAPHORA, is, when many clauses have the like beginning; You whom vertue hath made the Princess of Felicity, be not the minister of ruine. You whom my choyce hath made the Goddess of my safety. You whom Nature hath made the Load- star of comfort , be not the rock of shipwrack . This figure beats upon one thing, to cause the quicker apprehension of it in the audience, and to awake a steepy or dull passion. EPISTROPHE is contrary to the former, when many clauses end with the same words; Where the richness invited the eyes, the fashion entertained the eyes, and the device taught the eyes---And all the night did nothing but weep . Philoclea, sigh Philoclea, and cry out Philoclea,  &c. Either arm their lives, or take away their lives . This is rather a Figure of Narration or Instruction, then of motion. SIMPLOCE or COMPLEXIO, is when several sentences have the same beginning and the same ending. The most covetous man longs not to get riches out of that ground which can bear nothing; Why? Because it is impossible. The most ambitious person vexes not his wits to climb to heaven. Why? because it is impossible . This is the wantonnest of Repetitions , and is not to be used in serious matters. EPANALEPSIS is the same in one sentence which SIMPLOCE or COMPLEXIO is in several; As, Severe to his servants, to his children severe . Or the same sound reiterated first or last in a sentence. As, His superior in means, in place his superior. In sorrow was I born, and must die in sorrow. Unkindness moved me; and what can so trouble my courses, or wrack my thoughts, as unkindness ? This is a mild and sweet Figure, and of much use, though single and by it self, not usual in the Arcadia , unless thus, Overthrow of my desires, recompence of my overthrow. EPANODOS is, when the midst and end, or midst and beginning are the same; As, If there were no true pleasure in sleep and idleness, then no doubt the Heathen Philosophers would have placed some part of the felicity of their heathen Gods in sleep and idleness. Your diligence to speak well must be great, but you shall be abundantly recompenced for, the greatness of your diligence in the success of perswasion. If I should ever wish the perfection of your eloquence, it is for your instruction, and for your benefit, that I would wish you eloquent . This kind of Repetition and the former EPANALEPSIS are most easily admitted into discourse, and are freest from the opinion of affectation; because words recited at the beginning of many sentences, or at both ends of the same, are more remarkable. ANTIMETABOLE, or COMMUTATIO, is a sentence inverst, or turn'd back; as, if any for love of honour, or honour of love ,  &c. That as you are the child of a mother: so you may be mother of a child ,  &c. They misliked what themselves did; and yet still did what themselves misliked. &c. If before he languished, because he could not obtain his desiring; he now lamented, because he could not desire the obtaining---Either not striving, because he was Contented; or contented, because he would not strive.---Just to exercise his might, mighty to exercise his Justice . Learned Sir Philip slipt often into this Figure, yet he sometimes conceald the particularity of his affection to it, by not turning the words wholly back, as they lay; To account it not a purse for treasure, but as a treasure it self worthy to be purs'd up; &c. Men venture lives to conquer; she conquers lives without venturing, &c. Shewed such fury in his force, such stay in his fury ; which is rather EPANODOS; Sometimes the same sence inverst in contrary words. As, Parthenia desir'd above all things to have Argalus; Argalus feared nothing but to misse Parthenia . Where he returns fear to misse instead of desire. Neither could you have thought so well of me, if extremity of love had not made your judgement partiall; nor could you have loved me so intirely, if you had not been apt to make so great undeserved judgment of me . Where he returns, for, extremity of love, loving intirely ; and for partiall judgement; great undeserved judgement. Though this be a sharp and witty Figure, and shewes out of the same words, a pretty distinction of meaning very convenient for Schoolmen, yet to use this or any other unreasonably or unseasonably, is ridiculous. Let discretion therefore be the greatast, and most generall Figure of Figures. PARANOMASIA is a present touch of the same letter, syllable or word, with a different meaning. And as for the running upon the letter more then very little, is more then too much, Sir Philip Sidney in Astropell and Stella , calls it the Dictionary method, and verses, so made, Rimes running in ratling rowes , which is an example of it. There is an old Swinish Poem made of it in Latine, call'd PUGNA PORCORUM. Hector, Hanno, Hanibal dead, Pompey, Pyryhus spild, Cyrus, Scipio, C aesar slain, And Alexander killd[illeg.] Agnemination of some syllables is somtimes found in the Arcadia ; as, Alas what can saying make them believe whom seeing cannot perswade . And, while he was so followed by the valiantest, he made a way for the vilest. She went away repining, but not repenting. Our Alms-deeds are turned into all Mis-deeds; our praying into playings our fasting into feasting . That kinde of breaking words into another meaning, is much used in Drolerie , and youthful Discourse; as, you will have but a bare gain out of this bargain, A man not only fit for the gown, but for the gun; for the pen, but for the pike; for the book, but for the blade . The garnish of this figure has been in much request in less serious matters, but the more learned have avoided this kinde of flourish, lest their writings should savour more of the general humor, then of private judgement. PROLEPTOTON or TRADUCTIO, is a repetition of words of the same linage, that differ onely in termination; as, exceedingly, exceeding. His faulty using of our faults. Sometimes the same word in several cases; as, for fear, conceal'd his fear . Sometimes the same word in several voyces; as, forsaken by all friends, and forsaken by all comfort . Sometimes the same adjective in several comparisons; as, much may be said in my defence, much more for love, and most of all for that divine creature, who has joyned me and love together . This is a good figure, and may be used with or without passion, yet so as the use of it come from choice, not barrenness. To Amplifie and Illustrate , are two of the principal Ornaments of Eloquence, and gain mens mindes to the chiefest advantages, Admiration and Belief ; For how can you commend any thing more acceptable to our Attention, then by telling us it is extraordinary, and by demonstrating it to be evident? We love to look upon a Commet above all Stars, for these two excellencies, its Greatness and its Clearness ; such in speech is Amplification and Illustration . We amplifie five ways, by Comparison, Division, Accumulation, Intimation , and Progression. Comparison is either of things contrary or equal or things different: Equall, as, Themistocles and Coriolanus (both great States men, both of great desarts to their Country, both banished, both dead at one time : Themistocles his Councel could not prevail against the Ingratitude of the Athenians; nor Coriolanus his Discretion ouercome the unkindness of the Romans; the one was too excellent; the other too noble; for the envious eyes of their Countrymen to endure, such is the force of vertue, above all quarrels of Nations, or divisions of Allegiances; that their exiles were honorably entertained , Coriolanus by the Volsci, Themistocles by the Persians, both by their enemies, and both leading great Armies against those Countreys, which so ingratefully expelled them) were so inwardly restrained with a conscience of sacking their native soil, that they rather chose violence to their own lives, then to those of their fellow Citizens, and took it for a sufficient revenge to make it evident they might be revenged. But this is not so forcible an Amplification of things equal indeed (wherein, as you see, all the several points of a consorted equality are to be searched out) as when things seeming unequal are compared, and that in Similitudes as well asin Examples ; for instance, where a woman is compared to a ship, out of Plautus, both ask much tackling, and sometimes rigging . And you shal profit most of all, by inventing matter of agreement in things most unlike: London and the Tennis Court are like. for in both all the gains go to the hazard. Policy is like the Sea, it serves for intercourse of profit, for defence against invasions; there are both ebbings and flowings, calms and tempests; the observation whereof may make a man first wise, then rich. But as the water serves for many outward uses, so can it not please, if it be inwardly swallowed: If you sail upon it, it will carry you wheresoere you will desire; but if you drink it, it doth not satisfie, but increase desires . Again for Example; Eriphyle and Tarpeia ( both women in whom nature should govern love, and love warrant fidelity) were both easily induced to be false, with trifling temptations; they both betrayed, not one friend to another, nor the dearness of love for the height of preferment, but their most assured lovers to their most deadly enemies, for toys, jewels and bracelets . Eriphyle, her husband Amphiaraus ( the stay of her life) to Adrastus, his professed enemy : Tarpeia, the Capitol ( the defence of her Country) to the Sabines, that besieged it, yet neither can remain as invitation, much less as encouragement to Treason; For Eryphile was slain by her son, whom nature should have bound to her defence ; Tarpeia by the Sabines, whom her deserts should have obliged to her safe- guard . In comparing of two, when you would raise the person or thing you intend to make excellent, you must take the meanest parts of a greater example, and match them with the best of your purpose, and by such partiality you shall amplifie and extol the subject you treat of; as Isocrates did in his comparison of Cyrus and Thaagarus . Otherwise for impartial comparisons, which notwithstanding do amplifie, read the matches, or encounters of the most famous Grecian and Roman Examples in Plutark. Comparisons of things different. In the former Comparison, is a Composition of the points at first, because I presuppose the histories on both sides to be familiar to you by reading; but if you were to marshal histories, whereof both or either were not sufficiently known, then had you need begin with single relations; As if a man would compare Vascus Gama with Sir Francis Drake , he might say, Sir Francis Drake indeed travelled round about the world in two years, saw divers Nations, endured many perils at sea, and returned laden with great Treasure; And Vascus Gama first searched the Coast of Quiloa, Mozambique, and Calicute, and opened the passage to the East Indies. But as it was easie for Drake to proceed further in discoveries, when he had entrance made by Columbus: So was it most dangerous and difficult for Gama to adventure a course, without example and direction : Drake scoured the Coasts with a sufficient company of ships, made pillage of others, and thereof furnished himself for his enterprize; Gama went but weak at first, lost most of his small Fleet, and met nothing at seas, but tempests and famine . Drake invaded upon opportunities, hazarded but his own fortune, and retired to sea upon all advantages . Gama had in charge an expedition of his Soveraigns Command, was constrained to victual himself among barbarous Nations, and not only buy provision in their continent with the price of his blood, but durst not depart without leaving his King proclaimed and possessed in their Territories, divers places of strength fortified, and established to his use: So that if Gama had been to pursue the example of Drake, as Drake had the light of Columbus & Magellus Travels, Vascus Gama's spirit was as like to have conquered the whole world, as Drakes fortune was to compass it. And where the parts of Collation are most obscure, there your narration must be the longer; As, Cicero in comparing Marcellus &Verres , makes a long recital of the acts of Marcellus to acquaint the hearers with them before comparison; In some cases, after good confidence of proof, your examples may come in more thick and plentiful; As, If to protract a battel upon advice, be cowardize, then Phocion, then Metellus, then Fabius, and all the valiantest Captains of all ages were cowards. If to displant the rebellious natives of Scotland, and to root them out of that kingdom, be cruelty , then the Colonies translated by the Romans into Sicily, into France, into the severall coasts of Italy,  & divers other places, testifie great cruelty. But comparison of things different is most comendable, where there seems to be great affinity in the matters confer'd; as in the King of Spains assisting the Irish , and the Queen of Englands aiding the Netherlands. The Spaniard gave assistance to a people untrue in their Treaties, uncivill in their maners, to those who have traiterously rebelled without provocation, and fled out contrary to their own submission, brake their own peace, and wasted their own Countrey. The Queen did but lend some few voluntaries to the protection of a Nation, peaceable in their lives, free by their priviledges, a people denying no claim of any true Prince, except perpetuall servitude of their bodies, and importable exactions of their goods. Another exampl of things different compared. Is not the marriage of heads of Houses &Colledges as lawful as the marriage of the Doctors of the Arches, or the Clerks of the Chancery? both were interdicted by the same law, & yet I take it not indifferent, that both should by the abrogation of the same law be equally repealed. The one hath his living casual by his temporal pains, the other his maintenance certain by Ecclesiastical provision; The one may purchase by the improving his revenues, & so may lawfully raise a patrimony to maintain his posterity: The other can by no thrift upon the common goods gather a living for a wife and children; without imbezeling from the poor, deducting from Hospitality, defeating the intent of the giver, or defrauding his succession. Lastly, the one hath all to the use of his office, the other is owner of nothing, but to his owne behoof & disposition . In these two sorts of Amplifications you may insert all Figures, as the passion of the matter shall serve. Comparison of contraries is the third and most flourishing way of Comparison. Contraries are somtimes arranged together by pairs one to one, thus: Compare the ones impatiency with the others mildness, the ones insolency with the others submission, the ones humility with the others indignation, and tell me; whether he that conquer'd seem'd not rather confounded, then he that yeelded any thing discourag'd . Compare not mind, with mind, lest it seem fantastical, and beyond the tryal of our senses; But set the ones triumph against the others captivity, loss against victory, feasts against wounds, a Crown against fetters, misfortune against felicity; & the majesty of courage wil be found in the overthrown . More examples of this you have in the figure Contentio , which is one of the instruments to aggravate, by way of Comparison , Yet one example more. He that prefers wealthy ignorance before chargeable study, prefers contempt before honour, darkness before light, death before life, and earth before heaven. This is one way of arranging contrarieties. There is another way of ordering them with interchangeable correspondence in sentences, that, though each touch not other, yet it affronts the other, As, Shal a Souldier (for a blow with his hand given in war to a Captain) be disgraced? And shall a Lawyer (for the Bastinado given in a Court of Justice to his Companion) be advanced? shall we that profess Laws, maintain outrage? And shall they that break all Laws, yet in this observe civility ? Where you may see every word in the latter sentence aggravated by opposition to every word in the former. Another, Did the most innocent vouchsafe a part of his glory to pray for his enemies? and shall we the most sinfull esteem it a blot to our reputation to be unrevenged on our brethren ? Of this you shall have more examples hereafter. But unless it be for the Declamatory exercise, you are to avoid too great swelling without substance, The second way of Amplification is by Division, which (as a modern Author says) is to anatomize it into several parts, and to examine it according to several circumstances; Not unlike the shew that Pedlers make of their Packs when they display them, contrary to the German magnificence, that serves in all the good meat in one dish. But whereas the same Author says, that this Art of Amplifying will betray itself in method and order; I think it rather adorns it self. For, instead of saying, He put the whole Law to the Sword ; let me reckon all ages and conditions, and say; He neither saved the young men, as pittying the unripe flower of their youth; nor aged men, as respecting their gravity; nor children, as pardoning their weakness; nor women, as having compassion on their Sex; Soldier, Clergyman, Citizen; armed or unarmed, resisting or submitting, all within the Town were destroyed by the fury of that bloody Executioner . Note that the divisions here, are taken from age, prosession, sex, habit, or behavior. It may likewise be from all circumstances; All dance, the Heavens, Elements, mens minds, Commonwealths, and so by part all dance. Another example varyed, He apparels himself with great discretion ; Thus amplifie in circumstances. For stuffs, His cloaths were more rich then glittering: As to the fashion, rather usual for his quality, then fantastical for his invention; for colour, more grave and uniform, then wild and light. For fitness, made as well for ease of exercise, as to set forth to the eye those parts which had in him any excellency . So, to say, he would take an occasion of discourse with a young witty Lady, and would raise it first from her behaviour . If she said nothing, he would partly quarrel with her silence ; if she smiled , he would gather out of it some interpretation of praise of her favour, and of his own joy and good fortune; if she frowned , he would both move her to mirth, and deny she could be angry in earnest; if she were sad, he would conform his speech and action in that soberness to her humor, as might beguile her passion, by way of false confederacy; if she walked or played, the secret praise of her face, her eyes, her hair, her voyce, her hands, her body, her gate, was the application of most conceipts, whatever gave the ground of them; yet with such dissembling art, as if forgetfulness or love alluded in them, not cunning or want of variety. So you may divide by the forms of speech in general; as, he was never to seek how to propose or invent, raise or maintain, reconcile and distinguish any Arguments, Histories, Similitudes, Proverbs; Jests attended him in great plenty, when he needed to imploy them: he would deliver strong Reasons carelesly, and choyce words smoothly and unaffectedly; he used a sporting wisdom, an eloquent prating. But with Gallants and Ladies of better respect, and less curiosity, his duty, their kindness, their common acquaintance, the occasion of his coming, the remembrance of his last conference, the place, the time, the last news of forraign parts, the Court, the Country, the City, fed his invention, and satisfied their ears . All this is but division of the persons, with whom you conversed, their Manners, Carriage, the Fashions and Ornaments, the Matter and Subject of discourse. This in some sort used, is more properly called Dilatation , then Amplification ; and being often practised, will inable you to discourse almost of any thing, wherein you are not precisely tyed to the exact manner of division, which Logicians use. But you have liberty of seeking all things comprized within the sence of your general Theam, differ they essentially, or in any notable Property. You may also if you please, run over the intire part of Amplification; as, the ship was blown up ; for the ship , you may say the mast, sails, tackling, keel, prow, stern ; for blowing up , you may say rent, torn, smoothered, scattered in the ayr, sunk under the water, all the circumstances of blowing up . So in saying a fair tree , you may divide the tree into the root, body, branches and fruit ; and fairness , into talness, straightness, verdure, sweetness , and such things as are fair in a tree. In describing a gallant man , you may talk of his minde, person, his attempting, prosecuting and finishing an enterprize. And note, that this Amplification has in it both credibility and instruction; for it makes, instances of that, which being generally spoken, would seem but a flourish, and gives more special note of that kinde, which universally could not be conceived, without coufusion and dulness. This kinde of Amplification is more taken up by Cicero then Demosthenes ; for Demosthenes never uses it, but as it falls in his way. The third way of Amplification , is Accumulation , which is a heaping up many terms of praise or accusation, importing but the same matter, without descending into any part, and has his due season after some argument of proof. Otherwise it is like a Schoolman, forming out Synonyma's , or words of one meaning, and will sooner beget a censure of superfluity of words, then sufficiency of matter. But, let us give some example to amplifie a Sedition; tumults, mutinies, uproars, desperate conspiracies, wicked confederacies, furious commotions, trayterous rebellions, associations in villany, distractions from allegiance, bloody garboyls, intestine Massacres of Citizens . But this example is somewhat too swelling. Now to describe a beautiful woman; you may say, She hath a most winning countenance, a most pleasant eye, a most amiable presence, a cheerful aspect, she is a most delicate object, &c. The taste of former times has term'd it sweet, to bring in three clauses together of the same sense; as, Your beauty (sweet Lady) hath conquered my reason, subdued my will, master'd my judgment . How this will hold among our curious Refiners, I know not; he that looks on the wearing of it, will finde it bare, how full of stuffe soever it appears. First, it passeth for parts of division, when indeed it is but a variation of an English. Yet notwithstanding the practice will furnish you store of phrases, without which you shall never have choice, the Mother of perfection. Cicero in his Orations uses it much; some others follow it to four clauses, but he seldom exceeds three. It has this certain effect; it will sufficiently secure your vein not to be dry and exhausted. But to return to our first sort of Accumulation , and reduce it with this, under one precept. I take the use of this to be in anger, detestation, commiseration, and such passions, as you, seeming throughly possest with, would willingly stir up in others. The fourth way of Amplification is by Intimation , and leaves the collection of greatness to our understanding, by expressing some mark of it. It exceeds speech in silence, and makes our meaning more intelligible by a touch, then by direct treating; as he that should say, you must live very many years in his company, whom you should account for your friend , says well; but he that says, you had need eat a bushel of salt with him , saith more, and gives you to reckon more then many years in his company, whom you should account for your friend. It savors sometimes of Hyperbole ; as, that man that is grown gross, is grown from a body to a Corporation ; again, for a little man on horse-back, He was taken for a hat riding on the pommel of a saddle . Of this sort, examples are familiar; So honest a wrangler, that his nose being betwixt, was the onely cause why his two eyes went not to Law . So the hugeness of a Gyant is exprest, by saying, his skul held half a bushel of wheat . This may be done with Ironia , or denyal; He was no notorious malefactor, but he had been twice on the pillory, and once burnt in the hand for trifling oversights . So by ambiguity of the word, he draws his sword oftner then his purse . This fashion of Amplification , I term Intimation , because it do's not directly aggravate; but by consequence or proportion, intimate more to your minde, then ears. PROGRESSIO is the last kind of Amplification , which by steps of comparison scorns every degree, til it come to the supreme; and sometimes to advance the matter higher, it descends lower. It is an ornament in speech to begin at the lowest, that you may aspire to the highest Amplification , For example, in reprehending the prodigality of Monuments; I begin wih the excesses of Alphonsus on his fathers funeral; thence to Alexanders profusion upon one of his friends Tombs; then to Urbanus, towards his servant; thence to C aesar, on his horses burial; after that, to the Molossians on their dogs; and thence to the Egyptians; that charged themselves with the sumptuous burial of a Crocodile . So, seeming in some sort, to admit the first less then the second, and by growing weaker and weaker in the excess of every one, as I proceed, the last will seem most ridiculous, if not odious. So Cicero against Verres , meaning to amplifie his Bribery and Extortions. It is rigorous exaction (saith he) not to absolve the innocent without mony; great cruelty to commit him, till he ransom himself; but not to suffer the parties to have access unto him without reward, is wretched covetousness. To sell the egress and regress of them that bring him victuals; nay, to take money that he shall have an easie death: To put a price upon the strokes that shall execute him; So much, that he shall be beheaded at one blow; so much, at two. This is beyond all degrees of most barbarous and intolerable extortion . So in another example; He was careless of doing well, a loosness of youth; he was inclined to do ill, a weakness of flesh; his minde consented to offend, a shrewd temptation; he committed the act, an unhappy fault; he accustomed himself to abuse, a sad employment: yet he did not this alone, but infected others with his perswasion, and seduced them by his example. And not that only but detained those he had drawn in, with fresh inventions, and disgraced the modesty of them who resisted his corruptions, with scorns and derisions, which could argue no less in him, then a most reprobate damnable resolution. The rule of this is, when you would praise or discommend any thing, to consider how many less things there are of that kinde, to which notwithstanding you would give some shew of importance. As he that would render sleep obnoxious, may say, Idleness (which is less) by Draco's Laws was Felony . Or, to give that Bishop his right, that built whole Colleges at his own charges, and indowed them with Lands. Look downwards how rare it is for a Prelate in these days, not to grant long Leases, diminish the revenues of his fee, How laudable it is to repair the ruines of his own decayed Palaces and Granges? How magnificent an Act it is thought for a noble person to build an Hospital. How royal for two or three Princes to erect one Colledge. And can there be such an unthankfulness, as to bear but an ordinary remembrance of him, that inricht his Bishoprick , built two the most famous Nurseries of Learning in the Land, was liberal to all wants in his life, and left worthy bequests to all degrees at his death . In like sort, by an example of abusing the name of God. To make table talk of a mean mans name were injurious; to run upon a Noble mans title, were great scandal; to play with a Princes name, were Treasen: and what shall it be to make a vanity of that name, which is most terrible even to Tyrants and Devils, and most reverend even to Monarchs and Angels ? There be two contrary ascents to the top of this form, either by extenuating the means, as in a former example: or by aggravating them, as in this last of swearing. And may not a matter be well an plified in this manner, by exchanging the comparison of every particular circumstance, that the whole may seem the greater? As in this example, It is lamentable that a young man should be offended with the advice of his experienc'd friend, tending to his profit. First, it is a hard case that counsel should be neglected, but harder that it should offend. It is a sad thing to see any displeased with good admonitions; but more sad, to see a youth so effected. Who would not grieve to have his advice ill taken? but who would not grieve more, to see his experience controlled? Unhappy is that youth who listens not to the good exhortations of the Skilful. But more, that disdains the instructions of his discreet friend. He is miserable and unfortunate, that quarrels with the sound precepts of his deer friends, but more miserable and unfortunate, that mislikes directions given for his own good and advantage. This is a most easie, clear and usual kinde of Amplification ; For it gives more light and force to every circumstance. The circumstances are these. The persons , who and to whom, the matter , the intent , the time , the place , the manner , the consequence , and many more: Out of every one of which, any thing may be made more notable, and egregious by way of comparison. And that it may the better be remembred by you, let inquiry be made in every controversie for the circumstances, and compare them with other less matters, and you shall hardly fail of discourse, or be left on ground for want of good invention. There is a richer shew in this kinde of amplifying by every circumstance, then in any other. First, you must begin every circumstance with a new figure. Sometimes with Affirmation , sometimes with Interrogation , sometimes with Admission , sometimes with Ironia . Secondly, when you, upon every circumstance, urge the whole sense, you are for every circumstance almost to vary the words: As before, for Lamentable; unhappy, unfortunate, heavy, sad, grievous : so for Counsel; Admonitions, Advice, Exhortations, Instructions, Precepts Directions . Again, I say, remember this kinde of progression by circumstances, and urging and aggravating all the points of a Sentence: For you shall finde it used as much as any figure in Rhetorique, by all good Speakers and Writers. There are Figures that help Amplification , and make shew of setting forth a matter fairer then it is. The first is HYPERBOLE, whereof I will give you some such examples, as my own reading long since observed in the Arcadia . Sometimes it expresses a thing in the highest degree of possibility beyond the truth, that in descending thence, you may finde the truth. Sometimes in flat impossibilities, that you may rather conceive the unspeakableness, then the untruth of the relation. Possibly, as for Hypocritical Hoste, he gave as pleasing entertainment, as the falsest heart could give him, whom he means worst unto. That ever eye saw, or heart could imagine . For diligent inquiry; making their eyes, their ears, and their tongue serve for nothing else, but that inquiry . This is the utmost possible. But in the very frontiers of impossibility, thus though a thousand deaths followed it, and every death were followed with a hundred dishonors. The world sooner wanted occasions, then he valour to go through them. Words and blows came so thick together, as the one seemd a lightning to the others thunder . Sometimes there is no certain quantity of a thing set, but plainly and ingeniously told unvariably. As, Beyond the bounds of conceipt, much more of utterance . And, this Figure is more for the credit of your wit, then of your speech. CORRECTIO, having used a word of sufficient force, yet pretending a greater strength of meaning, refuses it, and supplyes the place with one of more extension; As, I perswade you not to let slip occasion, whilst it may not onely be taken but offers, nay sues to be taken . Where the first rising of the matter is, upon, Not only, but then upon the correcting, Nay : Again, you must be content, nay you must be desirous to take pains, if you will write well; It is the onely quality, which in all actions will gain you praise, praise (said I) nay honor . This Figure is to be used, when you would make the matter more credible in it self, then by the manner of delivery; 'tis sometimes used upon passion, without intent to amplifie: As, you stars, if you do not succor me: no, no, you will not help me . O Parthenia, no more Parthenia, what art thou ? There are two contrary ways to this form, and both lead to Amplification , but in a dissembling sort. The first is by Ironia , which expresses a thing by the contrary, by shew of exhortation, where indeed it dehorts. As, yet a while, sleep a while; fold thine arms a while: so shall necessity overtake thee, like a traveller, and poverty set on thee like an armed man.---It was but small charges of idle money that the Egyptians bestowed in erecting a Pyramis of brick, when the expences in Onyons and garlike for Workmens dyet, came to about 238000l. of our money. ... Milo had but slender strength, that caryed an Ox a furlong on his back, then killed him with his fist, and eat him to his Breakfast. ... Titornus had a reasonable good arm; that could hold two bulls by the tails, the one in the one hand, the other in the other, and never be stirred out of his place by their violence . Here small, slender and reasonable , amplifie as much as if you had laid great, exceeding , or incredible. PARALEPSIS (the second counterfeit of Amplification ) is when you say you let pass that which notwithstanding you touch at full: as, I make no account of any hinderance in other the direct studies of my course; I value not my pains in collecting these Observations; I will forget that I denyed the earnest intreaty of many kind and learned Gentlemen. that sued to me for helps; I am loath to tell you they are notes of his, whom your Masters of the University have thought as great a Reader, and a greater observer, then themselves; I desire not, that you should make any greater estimation of them, then of a testimony of my love to you, and a pledge of my resolution to encourage those lovely sparks of good invention, which if you smother and quench in your self, you commit a kind of intellectual murther . The like is used often in Progression , But another, I urge not to you the hope of your friends, though that should animate you to answer their expectation; I lay not before you the necessity of the place, which you are to furnish, wherein to be defective and insufficient were some shame; I omit the envious concurrencies, and some prepared comparisons in your Countrey, which have some feeling with yong men of fore-sight; I onely say, how shall our promises give judgement against us? how shall we discharge our own Engagements to your Father, if this time hath not taken his full effect of profit in our labours and endeavours . Two figures properly belong to this kinde of Amplification , which are called ACCVMVLATION and DIUISION. The first is a round dispatching of much matter, not plainly and simply the same in sence, yet tending to the same end, as, Loves companions are unquietness, longings, fond comforts, faint discomforts, hopes, jealousies, rages, carelesness, yieldings, &c. Spite, rage, disdain, shame, revenge came upon hatred . These examples are out of Arcadia . You may frame one thus. All men exclaim upon these exactions, Nobles, Gentry, Commonalty; Poor, Rich, Scholers, Merchants, Peasants, Yong, Old, High, Low, and all cry out upon the hard impositions of these burthens. The second Figure differs not much from the first, but that the first is a sudden entrance into a confused heap of matter. This is a wilde and dissolute repetition of all that went before. As, you haue heard of his pride, ambition, cozenage, robberies, mutinies, in the City, in the Camp, in the Country. What Kinsman of his unabused, what friend undeceived, what companion uncorrupted, can speak for him? where can he live without shame? where can he dye with honor ? These two Figures not only make your cause seem better, but skilfully and properly used, do amaze an adversary of mean ability. There are other Figures that come in firly after Amplification , or any great heat justly inflamed, Interrogation and Exclamation. INTERROGATION is but a warm proposition, yet it oftentimes doth better then a bare Affirmation , which were but too easie and life-less a speech: as, The credit of behaviour, is to cover imperfection, and set forth your good parts better . Thus expressed, Is it not the chiefest credit of behaviour, to set forth your good Parts fairly and clearly, and to cover imperfection? Men are ignorant, and therefore by good expressions without ranting or affection, you shall gain a more general opinion, then by sufficiency smothered in too modest a silence . By Interrogation thus, Are not most men ignorant? shall you not then by quaint expressions, without ranting or affectation, please more, and get a more general good opinion, then by great sufficiency concealed by your own shamefastness ? To dissemble excellencies is good policy in him, whom his course must at length necessarily draw into light and proof, and then all that he delivers will be admirable, because expectation forestall'd nothing of his worth; which may likewise be turned into an Interrogation , and is very fit for a speech, addressed to many illiterate hearers; is much used in Pirocles Oration to the seditious multitude, and then it may be well frequented and iterated. Did the Sun ever bring fruitful Harvest, but was more hot then pleasant? Have you any of your children, that be not sometimes burdensom? Have you any Fathers that be not sometimes froward? shall we therefore curse the Sun? hate our children? and disobey our Fathers ? An example of many Interrogations. Have you not seen a stately kinde of courtesie, and a proud kinde of humility? have you not seen a wiseman withdraw himself from mean company, with better grace, and more kindeness, then some silly Gentleman that has bestowed himself on fools, thrown himself down into the midst of his miseries? doth not a commendations, a hat, a good word, a good morrow, purchase more hearts, then a moneths familiar pratling, with a flock of rude people? Do you converss with your superiors, to learn of them to be able to judge them, and benefit your self; And shall not your inferiours do the like with you? Is it not a safer gain of popularity, with ceremonies, then with discovering your Nature ? Many such like Interrogations might be added; but let it suffice, that t'is easie and gentile to sharpen the da[illeg.]s of affirmations and down-right telling of Tales. EXCLAMATION is not lawful, but in the extremity of motion; as Pyrocles , seeing the mild Philoclea innocently beheaded, cryed out, O Tyrant Heaven, and Traytor Earth, blind Providence, how is this done? How is this suffered? Hath this world a Government ? The like in the beginning of the second Book of the Arcadia in the person of Genetia tormented in mind O Sun! O Heavens! O Deserts! O Vertue! O imperfect proportion ! And in another Author thus, O endless endeavour! O vainglorious Ignorance! Dost thou desire to be known? Where? In Europe; how canst thou be famous, when Asia and Africa, that have thrice as many people, hear not of thy actions? Art not thou then thrice as obscure as thou art renowned? Dost thou look that all the world should take notice of thee, when for five thousand years three parts of the world took no notice of the fourth? But Europe is the house of Fame, because it is the Nursery of Arts, and Books, wherein reports are preserved. O weak imagination! O self-pleasing fancy! Canst thou expect in these parts from 40 degrees to 90 North-ward, such praises and honours for thy name, when euery Map on every wall shews thee as much space from 40 to 90 Southward, inhabited with nothing but silence and forgetfulness ! ACCLAMATION is a sententious clause of a discourse, or a report, such as Daniel in his Poems concludes with often. It is a general instruction for every man commonly for his pains in reading a History, or other mens Books for some private use of it to himself. Like a Cash-keeper, who drawing great sums of other mens money, challenges somwhat in the pound for his own Fee. It serves for Amplification , when after a great crime or Desart exclaim'd upon, or extoll'd, it gives a moral Note worth credit and observation. As, after the true relation of Scipio Africanus's course, who having been chief governor of the greatest Armies in the world; having all his life time Kings suiters for his favour, and Nations kept in awe of his Name; yet in 56 years neither bought nor sold goods or lands, built any House or Castle of his own, left not above 46.l. in Gold, and 6.l. in silver behind him at his death. It may be folded up in this Acclamation: So little need has he to stoop to private cares, that thrives upon publick victories; also small leasure has he to be desirous of riches, that hath been so long possest and satisfied with honor, which is the immortal end of mortal actions . Such Notes are those scraps of policy which some now-a-days gather out of Polybius and Tacitus. and not unlike are the Morals that hang upon Esops Fables. This Acclamation sometimes is the cause and reason of a former Narration , as a story of one, who being a servant to a family, and of mean quality, won the doting love of a witty Lady in the House, whereas she never looked upon the humble suits, the cunning insinuations, the noble deserts of many lovers of higher degree, but with free judgement and careless censure; This close may follow, So hard entrance hath affection into a heart prepared to suspition, especially in the weakest natures, whose safeguard is mistrust: So easie is the increase of love by insensible steps, when the service you offer seems to proceed out of the goodness of your own disposition, which women expect to be permanent, and not out of the necessity of your suit which may force you for the time to a wained difference from the proper humor . Yet if this be too much used, it is like a Note-book gathered out of Histories. Contrary to Amplification is DIMINUTION, and this descends by the same steps that Amplification ascends, and differs no more then up Hill and down Dale, which is the same way begun out of several sentences; Yet some examples in Arcadia will make you observe two wayes of Diminishing single terms, one by denying the contrary; As if you should say, But reasonably pleasant; Arcadia's speech is, Not unpleasant, hardly liked, nor misliked . But why should I give examples of the most usual phrases in the English tongue? as we say, Not the wisest that ever we saw, for a man of small wisdome . The second way is, by denying the right of the words, but by error of some; As Those fantasticall mind-infected people, which Children and Musicians call Lovers. That misfortune of letting fall his Dagger, which the rude Hectors of our time, call being disarmed. That opinion of honesty, which has lately been so proudly translated by the Souldier into the word (Honor.) And such like. But the former fashion of Diminution sometimes in ironious sort goes for Amplifications , As speaking of a great personage, No mean man ; This is an ordinary Figure for all kinds of speeches. The Figures following serve for Amplification . ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  is a composition of contraries, and by both words intimates the meaning of neither precisely, but a moderation and mediocrity, As, bravery and raggery are contrary, yet somwhat better then both is meant by brave raggedness . So wanton modesty, inticing soberness . And with that she prettily smiled, which mingled with tears, a man could not tell, whether it were a mourning pleasure, or delightfull sorrow. With what a witty ignorance she would understand? &c. Absented presence; well-willing spight . The one contrary is affirmed to be in the other directly, by making the one the Substantive, the other the Adjective, as above in those examples; or indirectly, as in these words following. Seeking Honor by dishonor; And building safety upon ruine; O foolish woman, and most miserable foolish woman, because wit makes thee foolish. Captivity might seem to have authority over tyranny . This is a gentile way to move admiration in the hearers, and make them think it a strange harmony, which must be exprest in such discord. Therefore this example shall conclude. There was a perfect agreement in so perfect a disagreement: like musick made of cunning discords . This is an easie Figure, and useful. CONTENTIO is contrary to the former; That was a composition of Sturmius disagreements; This is an opposition of them. As, there was strength against nimbleness, rage against resolution, pride against nobleness. He is a swaggerer, amongst quiet men; but is quiet among swaggerers; Earnest in idle things, idle in matters of earnestness . Where there is both Antimetabole for the turning of the sentence back, and Contentio respecting the contrariety of things meant thereby. Could not look on, nor would not look off. Neither the one hurt her, nor the other help her. Just without partiality, humble with out contradiction, Liberall without profusion, Wise without curiosity . This Figure is fit to embelish a copious stile, and serves much for Amplification by Comparison. COMPAR is an even gait of sentences answering each other in measures interchangeably. Such as are in St. Augustine often, but oftner in Gregory the Divine; And in Bishop Andrews works in English. But many do intermingle this Figure with Agnominatio , and Similiter cadens ; It is very useful in elocution; But in penning it must be used with modesty and mediocrity. A touch of Agnomination of the Letter is tollerable with a Compar ; As, If ever I could wish my Faith untryed and my Counsel untrusted . And (where there is a similiter cadens , but a more evident falling alike) in this. My years are not so many, but that one death may conclude them; nor my faults so many, but that one death may satisfie them . Without consonancy of fall or harping upon a letter or syllable, yet a Compar ; because the words match each other in rank. Save his gray hairs from rebuke, and his aged mind from despair ; where gray hairs, aged mind, rebuke and despair answer each other. Again, Rather seek to obtain that constantly by courtesie, which you cannot assuredly enjoy by violence . Verb to Verb, Adverb to Adverb, and Substantive to Substantive. Loveliness can neither warrant you from suspitions in others, nor defend you from melancholy in your self. In some places there is a shorter Compar : where word to word, or substantive to substantive, are joyned, and yet without conjunction, which is ASYNDETON. Her face with beauty, her head with wisdom, her eyes with Majesty, her countenance wiuh gracefulness, her lips with lovelines ; Where many ( Ands ) are spared: In some plases only the Conjunction is put in the last in a Compar of three; As, her wit endeared by youth, her affection by birth, and her sadness by her beauty. A fair woman shal not onely command without intreaty, but perswade without speaking . This is an excellent Figure, in no place untimely, if not too often used It fits well the even pauses and interruptions o; an eloquent tongue, seems to be rich and copiouss and to contain many parts (where of each with a tedious man would be a sentence) and make an impression upon the hearers senses; It has long bin in request, ever since the days of Isocrates , whose Orations are full of it. This Figure belongs more properly to that part of Amplification , called Division , then to Accumulation. SENTENTIA , if it be wel used, is a Figure, if ill and too much, a Style, of which none that write humorously and factiously, can be clear in these days, when there are so many Schisms of Eloquence: We study now-a-days according to the predominancy of Criticall fancies. Whilst Moral Philosophy , was in request, it was rudeness, not to be sententious; whilst Mathematicks were of late in vogue, all similitudes came from Lines, Circles and Angles ; But now that Mars is predominant, we must recruit our wits, and give our words a new Quarter . 'Tis very true, a Sentence is a pearl in a Discourse; but it is a good Discourse that consists wholly of pearls. It is like an Eye in the body, nor is it monstrous to be all Eys. I take Cyclops to be as handsom a man, as Argos . And if a Sentence were as like a hand in the Text, as it is commonly noted with one in the Margent, yet I should rather like that Work that had no more hands then Hercules , then that which had as many as Briareus. These are Sentences, The rich mans bounty is the poor mans Exchequer, The sickness of age is avarice; The errors of youth prophaness . There is small difference between a Proposition and a Question, if I forget not Aristotle ([illeg.]. Top.) Since length of acquaintance, mutual secresies, nor height of benefits could oblige a savage mind . There is a Sentence, and in it ZEUGMA, ASYNDETON, and METAPHORA. Guiltlesness is not always with ease oppressed ; Where there is MERIOSIS, not always with ease , for, ever and hardly. Who stands onely upon defence, stands vpon no defence ; A sentence with EPANADOS. Unlawfull desires are punished after the effect of enjoying; But impossible desires are punished in the desire it self . A Sentence with DISTINCTIO and CONTENTIO. Love to a yielding heart is a King, but to a resisting, a Tyrant . COMPAR  & CONTENTIO; It is a foolish wittiness to speak of more then one thinks . Neither is this sentence without a Compar : it is a double sentence, as they call it, To a heart fully resolved, counsel is tedious, and reprehension loathsom . And, There is nothing more terrible to a guilty heart, then the eye of a respected friend . There may be also Sentences particular to some men, as well as generall; As, --- Amphiabes, in whom abused kindness became spitefull rage. ---Fearfulness, contrary to all other vices, making Clinias think the better of another, the worse be found himself . Euarchus, making his life the example of his laws . All which may be taken for Rules and Common places, by putting the general name for the special, as they say, drawing it  a THESI ad HYPOTHESIN. These Examples may make you believe, a Sentence may be cours'd through the whole Figure-book, and that many Figures may easily assemble in one Clause, and any one Figure consort with another. Yet it were absurd to ground the form and fashion of your whole style upon any one Figure. ILLUSTRATION consists either in things or words; in the description of things living or dead. And of living things, either reasonable, as men and their personages, and qualities; or unreasonable, as of Horses, Ships, Islands, Castles, and such like. Men are described most excellently in the Arcadia , As Besilius, Plexertus, Pirocles, Musidorus, Anaxius ,  &c. But he that will truly characterize a man, in a feigned Story, must first learn handsomly to describe a humour, a passion, a vertue, a vice, and therein, keeping decent proportion, add but names, and knit together the accidents and encounters. This perfect expressing of all qualities, is learn'd out of Aristotles tenth Book of Moral Philosophy. But because (as Machiavel observes) perfect vertue, or perfect vice is not seen in our time, which altogether is humorous and spirting: Therefore the understanding of Aristotles Rhetorique is held to be the best means to attain to true Eloquence; Excellent on this subject also are Theophrasti imagines; Heliodorus and Longinus in Greek (the last lately well translated into English) Zanaxarus his Arcadia in Italian, Diana demonte majori in Spanish, &c. But to our purpose, of personages and affections described in Arcadia . For men; pleasant, idle retiredness in a King Basilius , and a dangerous end of it. Unfortunate valor in Plangus ; Courteous valor in Amphialus ; Proud valor in Anaxius ; Hospitality in Kalandar ; The mirror of true courage and friendship in Pirocles , and Musidorus ; Miserableness and ingratitude in Chremes ; Fear and false subtilty in Clynias ; Fear and rudeness, with ill affected civility in Dametas ; And through this Story, Mutuall love in marriage in Argalus and Partbenia ; Out of marriage in Pirocles and Philoclea, Musidorus and Pamela ; True constant love unrespected in Plangus , in Helena , in the true Zelmane ; Inconstancy, envy, suspition and tyranny in a King and his Counsellors; Generall false love in Phamphilus ; and slight carriage and credulity in Chremes daughter; base doting on a wife in Plangus father. But in women a mischievous and seditious sto- mack in Cecropia ; Prudent courage in Pamela ; Mild discretion in Philoclea; Pamela's prayer, her discourse, squeamish cunning; Unworthiness in Artesia ; Respective and restless dotage in Gynetia's love. Proud, ill favoured, sluttish simplicity in Mopsa . Now in these persons is there ever a stedfast decency, and uniform difference of manners observed wherever you find them. However each interrupt the others story and actions. And as for actions of persons, there are many rarely and perfectly described. As the Mutiny and fire in a ship; causes of an Uproar; The Garboyl; an armed Skirmish; Policy and preparation. Sometimes managing a Horse is described; tilting and Shews. Many other lively and notable portraicts there are, which I will not set down, to save you so sweet a labour, as the reading of that which alone will make you eloquent and wise. Sir Philip Sidneys course (besides reading Aristotle and Theothrastus ) was to imagine the thing present, that his pen might the better describe it. Under this notion of Illustration may come lively descriptions, and the apt fitting a person represented with speech and action, both which grow into very pleasing acquaintance with the understanding and memory of the Reader. For special light in every Sentence, there are other marks of Figures. First, if there be any doubt or ambiguity in the words, it is better left out then distinguished. But if you are to answer former speeches, that imply any doubtfulness, you may disperse all clouds, and remove all scruples with Distinction . As being charged you have brought very light reasons, you may answer; If by light you mean clear, I am glad you see them; If by light you mean of no weight, I am sorry you do not feel them . So you may express a man of hidden learning, Hidden as well for the obscure and mean estate of his person, as hidden for the unusual and not vulgar conceit of the matter . But, as ambiguity is not onely in words but in matter; so both ways it is taken away by Distinction . Sometimes it is in single words, as in these former, light and hidden . Sometimes in coherence of Sentences, by reason of the relation of each word to other, by reason of the change of the pointing, which is cleared by delivery. You have many examples of this in the second Book of Tully de Oratore , and Quintilian , where there is mention of Jocus ab ambiguo ; As also in Erasmus his Apophthegmes. DISTINCTION of ambiguity in matters of determination of the truth of generall propositions is to tel wherein they are certain, wherein not. As, Travel in foreign Countreys settles a young mans humor. If it be taken in this sort, that it will inforce him to wariness and secresie, and restrain him from pouring forth his counsails, it is very profitable : For he shall have few friends in whom to put confidence, and few companions with whom he might bestow his idle time, or communicate his youthfull thoughts. But if you intend, that by travell all vanities should be cast off, it seems not so likely and admirable; because he shall walk through many ill examples, and great liberty . Another proposition distinguished. They are our frail merits that you shall bestow upon young mens friendship. 'Tis true, if you satisfie those desires which are like to depart with their youth; As, gaming, feasting, idle sporting; you are like to be cast off with these toys, and forgotten. But if your deserts be in noble Exercises, learned Conferences, and civill friendly Offices, the remembrance thereof will increase as fast as their discretion. So much for Distinction ; Next follows DEFINITION , which is the shortest and truest exposition of the nature of any thing; hereof you have examples of all vertues in Aristotles Morals , of passions in his Rhetorique , of many affections and perturbations in Tusculan's Questions, and Cicero de Finibus , as the generall definition of vertue is this, VIRTUS EST HABITUS RATIONI CONSENTANEUS. Vertue is a quality seated in Reason. Fear is an apprehension of future harm. Thrift is a moderate and lawfull increase of wealth by careful government of your own estate. Complement is a performance of affected Ceremonies in words, looks, and gestures . Where Definition runs into division of seven or eight ways. Of Definition you may read Valerius his Logick . But (to be most perfectly instructed) read the sixth book of Aristotles Top . Your Definitions need be no more tied to the Rules of Logicians, then your Divisions. The matter is sometimes illustrated by Periphrasis; As, spur'd his horse apace; Made his spur claim hast of his horse. A man not to be contemned; Nor a man over whom contempt might make any just chalenge. Snorting lowd; Snorting so lowd, that no man might lay the stealing of a nap to his charge . But of Paraphrasis and Periphrasis more severally. Sometimes a Parenthesis makes your discourse more graceful and intelligible: As, Tell me ingenuously (if there be any ingenuity in you) whether, &c. That what his wit could conceive (and his wit can conceive as far as the limits of reason stretch) was all directed to the setting forth of his friend.---Till the next morning (better known to be so by the Hour-glass, then the days clearness) having run fortune, &c. And indeed all Parentheses are in extreams, either graces or foyles to a Speech. If they be long, they seem interruptions, and therefore at the end of them must be a retreat to the matter, called ANTANACLASIS. As, Assure thy selfe most wicked woman (that hast so plaguily a corrupted mind, as that thou canst not keep thy sickness to thy self, but must most maliciously infect others) Assure thy self, I say, &c. Shall that heart (which does not only feel them, but hath all motion of his life placed in them,) Shall that heart, I say, &c. DIVISION is a severing the whole into parts, as of time into that past, present, and to come, (which is rather a breathing then a Division ) into supream or subordinate. From their order; beasts or unreasonable creatures, into those of the Air , Water, Earth; Love is either of Beauty, or of Vertue . From the object. Study is of Liberal, or Mathematick Science . And so you may divide as many ways as things may differ; as by their beginnings, endings, properties, marks, effects, times, tunes, places, forms, persons, in whom they are, and howsoever, which properly belongs to Logick; yet something is spoken thereof, in our second way of Amplification . Out of Divisions arise three several inforcements and manifestations of your purpose, which (though by Rhetoricians diversly handled and tearmed) yet are they in effect grounded upon the Art of Distribution. The first is Expedition , which (touching upon divers parts) destroys all, but that, on which you mean to rest; As, One of these courses must be taken, either you must distinctly observe and practise these Rules, or deny you ever received instructions, or alledge want of capacity in your self, or want of use of them in your life. That they are not necessary, you cannot say, for what more necessary in your life, then to write well? That you are uncapable; is a slander, and a contradiction to your own conscience and my experience, that hath seen such fair Essayes of your endeavours. And to say you had never any directions, were to give your two eyes the lie, and to make me believe, I did never but dream your good. Therefore must your labour conspire with my inventions, and so must you unavoidably become skilful . This is Enumeration and Inference , whereupon is that which the Logicians call Iuduction , as in reckoning up It is neither that, nor this: therefore this . And as one merrily saith. It is the Dogs Syllogisme in a cross way, or that, or that, But I smell him not this way, nor this way ; therefore he runs on his conclusion the third way without smelling. The second of this sort is PROSAPODOSIS that overthrows no part of the Division , but returns some part to each member. In Arcadia thus, Heretofore I accused the Sea. condemned the Pyrats, and hated my evil fortune, that deprived me of thee. But now thy self art the Sea, thy selfe the Pyrat, and thy will the evil fortune. ---Time at one instant seeming short and long to them, short in the pleasingness of such presence, and long in stay of their desires Your silence must carry with it a construction of contempt, unkindeness or displeasure: If you take me not for your friend, you offer unkindness; if you deem me unworthy of an answer, it proceeds of contempt; if your Passion defies a reply, it argues displeasure . The first of these denyed all parts, save one: This affirms and keeps all sides, up. The last is Dilemma , which proposes two sides, and overthrows both ability and will to write well: for to say I cannot, is Childish; and I will not, is Womanish. There is in the best Writers oftentimes a vain of stile, wherein vulgar fancies are exceedingly pleased, and know not wherewith. For they admire this most, that there is some excellency in it, and yet they themselves suspect it exceeds their admiration. In some examples I would gladly discover the reason hereof: It cannot be, if either the meaning of the words be obscure, and unfamiliar to a mans understanding, the speech so composed, should be so accepted: And yet 'tis possible there may be some extraordinary fancy in ordinary words: and plain meaning, how then shall we determine? It is as in many usuall dishes at a Table, both eyes and taste give them commendation, not for the substance, but for the dressing and service. What plainer meaning then, sleep among thieves ? And verily sleep, life, trust and thieves , are common English words; yet is it no common way of speaking, to say, To trust a sleeping life among thieves . In the same sense; when they had slept a while , is ordinary; But when they had a while hearkened to the perswasion of sleep , is extraordinary. Though all the words of it by themselves are most known and familiar; yet the ordering and fetch of it is strange and admirable to the ignorant; We therefore call it Periphrasis or Circumlocution, and it is much helped by Metaphors , as before: inclined to sleep is exprest by a Metaphor taken from one who moves and inclines by perswasions . But let us have one combate more with our adversary sleep ; for, having risen early having striven with the suns earliness Instead of Mopsa wept ill-favouredly , Mopsa disgraced weeping with her countenance ; Instead of saying, they that guarded Amphialus, were killed themselves ; its said, seeking to save him, they lost the fortresses, which nature had planted them in . Instead of Plangus speech began to be suspected ; it is said Plangus speech began to be translated into the language of suspicion . Thus purposely did Sir Philip write, to keep his stile from flatness. As being to name a Thresher , he calls him one of Ceres servants , Instead of his name was known to high and low ; he saith, no Prince could pretend highness, nor beggar lowness, to bar him from the sound thereof . And this is by going A CONCRETO AD ABSTRACTUM, and divers other ways. If a short ordinary sense be odly exprest by more words, it is Periphrasis ; but, if by as many other, it is Paraphrasis : as, manifest Oathes, plentiful perjury. To make a great show of himself. To make a muster of himself in the Island : for kill any married man; make his sword cursed by any widow; which is by consequence, seeking by curtesie to undo him . Making curtesie the out-side of mischief, by Similitude or Metapbor : so then the course [illeg.], instead of any ordinary words importing a trivia matter, to take the abstracts, or some consequence, similitude, note, property or effect, and thereby express it. These two figures serve for Illustration. It is sometimes requisite for gaining life and lustre in your discourse, to represent some unexpected strangeness, besides the tenor of your Theme or Story: and, as it were, to act your meaning; which is done either by faigning the presence or the discourse of some such persons, as either are not at all; or if they be, yet speak not but by your imagination. The first is by Apostrophe or Prosopopeia. APOSTROPHE, is a turning of your speech to some new person, as to the people or witnesses, when it was before to the Judges or Defendant: as, Herein you witnesses are to consult with your own consciences, and to enter into a true examination of your own memory. Did you mark his looks? Did you note his speeches? Did you truly conceive the particular proceedings of the Action ? To the people thus, Now let me intreat any man here present, that thinks himself not exempted from misfortunes, and priviledged from all mischiefs, to imagine himself in my case, and to undertake for my sake some few thoughts of my Distress . Sometimes the occasion is taken from some quality or other thing, where to your self gives shew of life; as, Hope tell me, what hast thou to hope for? Love be ashamed to be called Love . But to animate, and make dead men speak is PROSOPOPOEIA; as, If your Ancestors were now alive, and saw you defacing so goodly a Monument by them erected, would they not say thus--- &c. And as Sir Philip Sidney gives sense and speech to the Needle and Silk in Pamela's hands, as learning , as a Lily as death it self is faigned to live, and make a speech. Another way of clearing and reviving your discourse, is by deliberating by entring into communication , by preventing and answering Objections. In deliberating sometimes you are amazed; as, Whom shall I blame? what shall I pretend? shall I make learning hateful to you by my reprehensions? shall I make my silence accessary to your idleness? It is not in my power, It is not in my discretion to reform it . Under this figure are Philoclea's wishes of Zelmane. There is another kinde of Deliberation , which proposes many things with intricating or intangling a mans self: as, Nothing can assure me of the continuance of your love towards me, if you discontinue the study of speaking well. For suppose you marry into some worthy Family; suppose they enrich you with some new friends; may not a vein of thriving rob me of your acquaintance? may not I lose you? nay, may not you lose your self in a labyrinth of worldly cares ? Sometimes we enter into Communication ; as, Were it your case, what would you answer? Tell me, I appeal to your secret thoughts. Your friend hath esteemed better of his own stomack then of the eternal love vowed betwixt you, and prefers the tryal of his valour, before the regard of both your credits. which must dye, however either or both of you survive the combat. Would you not judge him unworthy to be your friend, that began his fidelity with an inviolable Covenant never to be an Enemy? Prevention of an Objection hath two figures; the one is Occupatio , the other Subjectio. Occupatio is thus, You will say to me, that in a factious Country it is the only policy to stand neutral. I say, not, unless many circumstances help you ; viz. These, if none of your friends be entred into the quarrel. If you be assured that your wealth and discreation is equall to the best. If there be a likelihood to scatter the reliance on both sides, and make a new park, then it is wisdom to stand aloof a while. that if you please you may adde the victory to which side you will. But having declared your self, you intend to be upright; you will grow contemptible, you offer Reconciliation; your strength will forsake you, you dispraise your adversaries; you will be deemed envious, You commend his wisdom; you betray your own weakness: praise then his wealth, his Ancestors, his Beauty, his pleasures; but praise not his foresight, nor his valour. Are you Judge among your neighbors and inferiors: be precisely just and rightful. Are you Assistant to your friend? be advisedly and throughly partial. You would be counted liberal? testifie it seldom; but if publiquely, worthily. You would thrive in bargaining; let your transactions be private: for many small breaches of conscience are more infamous then one great one. But offend not your conscience willingly to be Treasurer of all the Indian Mynes . Thus, you see how Counsels, Precepts and Sentences may be translated into the form of Occupatio and Subjectio . Sometimes Occupatio is left out, and an Argument brought to the contrary; as Cecropia perswading her son Amphialus to offer violence to Philoclea , presupposed that he would say, He must be modest : she replyes, Each vertue hath his time, the souldier that should march formost, must not give way for modesty . There is Occupatio and Subjectio in Arcadia, if she contemned, then thus---if otherwise, then &c. Did I walke abroad to see my delight? my walking was the delight it self. He saw her alive; he was glad to see her alive. He saw her weep: he was sorry to see her weep. He heard her comfortable speeches: nothing more joyful. This figure cannot be out of season, unless purposely; as it was in the fustian speech: You listen to my speeches, I must needs confess it. you hearken to my words; I cannot deny it; you look for some sense; I partly beleeve it: But you finde none; I do not much regard it. There is another figure, which hath been called by the name of Concessio , But I mean to mistake Occupatio and Concessio , one for the other, til I can distinguish them better. The form of Concessio is this, I admit you are resolute: I grant your determination is immoveable, but it is in things against your friends, judgements. And in things against your own honour and profit. (according to the com- parison of Demosthenes ) as sauce or seasoning. which whets the appetite, since they cannot pass for so- lid viands: otherwise in his opinion, there can be nothing more flat, and of less grace. Quintilian resembles a Discourse, which is stuffed too full of Epithetes to an Army, where in there are not more souldiers for service, then boys for attendance; and which is, by that means, rendred very great in number, but weak in force and courage. Conform to this is that of Longinus , who advises that we moderately use such Epithetes , as are not too high swoln, nor far fetched, but such as are apposite to the subject, In these latter refined days, we have a kinde of compound Epithetes , annexed to a noun with a Proche or Division (as the Printers call it) which are much used in Poetry, and sometimes in Prose: of which let me give you some examples, and so leave them. The Quiver-bearing Meads. The Tempest tossed seas. The Wool-ore-burthened sheep. The Meadow loving sorrel. A horror strucken minde. The Earth-encircling Ocean. An Heaven-inspired art. Sense-distracting grief. Fancy-pleasing faces. The Pine-plow'd sea. The Green-mantled earth. Soul-subduing graces. A Heaven-faln star. A self condemning minde. An un-Sun-seen cave. Love-distilling teares. This Heaven-displeasing war. Liver scalding lust. Marble-hearted cruelty. Time-beguiling pleasure. This Blood-be-dabled Kingdom. People-pleasing Lectures. Corner-haunting lust. A Life-Conferring form. &c. onely life and repast of all my desires: So is thy love to me a continual hunger, and this absence an extream famine. In absence my grief grows, in finding my present estate so weak in fortune, and my deserts so slender in nature; that not knowing with Anthony how to requite his Cleopatra , I only rest with Anthony , to dye for my Cleopatra. Tell him my love burns like vestal fire, which (with his memory, richer then all spices) disperseth odours round about my Soul, and did refresh it, when 'twas dull and sad with thinking of his absence. He more breathed A. B. then the ayr it self; and all her absences were to him so many deaths. I want no part of welfare, but your wished presence. The love he bare her at her return was as a torrent, (which after it has a long time been restrained) breaks the forced damms, and with vigorous impetuousness drowns the fields. Holy Court. Hoping forgetfulness (which commonly waits upon absence) might possess him, he departed. Since your absence, melancholy hath been my Concomitant, and your remembrance my greatest comfort. I departed from you, like a hungry infant, pull'd from his nurses breast, or a thirsty Hart chased from a sweet fountain. Live I pray you in repose, as much as you may, during this absence; and if my being away causes sorrow in you, let the assurance of my affection diminish it. \---Forced a tedious separation of those sacred bodies, whose Souls are entirely link'd in divine affection. service. \---And my self shall not onely acknowledge this favour with humblest thankfulness, but &c. The acknowledgement of your favours shall be my meanest thanks; and to thank you for those favours must be my best acknowledgment: I can do no more, I will doe no less. They acknowledge (with more or less degrees of homage) some kind of fealty. \---It shall not be without a just confession of the bond your benefits have, and ever shall hold upon me. affection. It is the flaming Agony of affection that works the chilling access of your fever.

My affections no less love the light and witness, then they have conscience of your vertue. The high tide of overflowing affection restraining his tongue with astonishment, as unable to express an unexpressable passion. The blood of her face ebbing and flowing according to the tyde of affection. He grafted his affection in the stock of her constancy. (Testimonies of a never silent hearty affection.) But perceiving his affection so grounded, that striving against it, did more anger then heal the wound, and rather cal his friendship in question, then give place to any friendly Counsel.--- The large testimony of your affection makes me willing to suppres a great number of errours. She in an instant was made an unfortunate winter of affection. To intrinsecate my selfe in your affection. My affection shall finde no parallel in its well- wishes to you.

Doctor Wats upon . Bacon. eloquent tongue have over earthly powers. Beauty consists in complexion, in lineaments, and in harmony. You are the most excellent star that shines in the bright element of Beauty. Some became Petitioners and Prisoners to her Beauty, others did homage to her vertues. Beauty is to be reckoned, but as an outward fading benefit, that nature hath bestowed. The Idol of beauty ought not to be honored with such oblations. My eyes drank much more eagerly of her beauty, then my mouth did of any other liquor, Her face is such a spark of beauty, as is able to enflame a world of love. \---She, who in a definite compass, can set forth infinite beauty. The excellency of her returned beauty, was a credible embassador of her health. Where beauty is, there needs no other plea. Sell not your soul for such a vanity as eye-pleasing beauty.

Rather then those eyes should over-flow their own beauties, or the sky of your beauty should be over-clouded with sorrow, I wil.--- Beauty in the heaven of her face (two Suns eclipsed) was wrapped up in paleness. Beauty which hath no grace, is a bait floating on the water without a hook, to be taken, and catch nothing. Eustasius. Beauty is like the herb Larix , cool in the Water, but hot in the stomack. I cannot but applaud the wonder of your beauty. Such is the divine power of loves deity, such the vertuous force of your heavenly beauty, and such the happy issue of our decreed destiny. Beauty without chastity, is like a Mandrake apple, comely in shew, but poysonful in taste. I must accuse my selfe of presumption, for daring to consider any moles in that face, which you had marked for a beauty. Sir K. D. \---A beauty, which always with too eloquent a tongue did dictate tacite perswasions to his heart. What a fair vestment is to a deformed body, the same is a comely body to a deformed minde. Bacon. A fair soul in a fair body, is a river that windingly creepeth with many wary turnings within the enamel of a beautiful meadow, and ravisheth the whole world with the admiration of its excellency. Beauty in it selfe is such a silent Orator, as ever is pleading for respect and liking and by the eyes of others is ever sending to their hearts for love. Feltham. The modest sweetness of a lilied face--- Beauty is the wit of nature put into the frontispiece. I have seen (and yet not with a partial eye) such features, and such mixtures, as I have thought impossible for either nature to frame, or art to counterfeit: yet in the same face, I have seen that which hath out-gone them both the countenance. Oh! if such glory can dwel with corruption, what Celestial excellencies are there in the Saints above? who would not gaze himself into admiration, when he shall see so rich a treasure in so pure a Cabinet, unmatched vertue in matchless beauty? Feltham. What is temporal beauty, but a transitory charm, an illusion of senses, a voluntary imposture, a slave of pleasure, a flower which hath but a moment of life, a diall on which we never look, but whilst the Sun shines on it? What is humane beauty but a dunghil covered with snow, a glass painted with false colours; a prey pursued by many Dogs, a dangerous hostess in a fraile house, a sugred fruit in a feast, which some dare not touch for respect, and others gormandize through sensuality? Go; trust so fading a good: Go; betake you to so unhappy a snare: Go; tye your contentments to so slippery a knot, what else will betide you but to court a phantasie, which, loosening your hold, will leave you nothing but the sorrow of your illusions?

As the wonder strove to make her pale, warm love fortifi'd her cheeks with guilty blushes. \---At whose presence a fresh vermilion dye bestowed a new complexion on her. length.

Be but thou as constant a friend to my mind, as thou shalt be a true possessor of my heart, and I shall have as just a cause of joy, as thou no cause of doubt. Though the surging sea hath moved the humors of my body, yet it hath not power to change the inclinations of my minde; for I love you no less at Antwerpe (where I am arrived) then I did at London, &c.

As there has been an unchast Helen in Greece ; so also a chast Penelope ; As there has been a prodigious Pasiphae : so has there been a goodly Theocrita. Hippomanes ceased to run when she had gotten the Goal: Hercules to labour when he had obtained the victory: Mercury to pipe when he had cast Argus in a slumber: Every action has his end.

C. \---There were Hills which garnish'd their proud heights with trees, humble valleys, whose low estate seem'd comforted with refreshing of silver rivers, meadows enameld with all sorts of eye pleasing flowers, thickets, which being lined with most pleasant shade, were witnessed so too, by the cheerfull disposition of many well-tun'd birds, each pasture stored with sheep, feeding with sober security, while the prety lambs, with bleating oratory, craved the dams comfort; Here a Shepheards Boy piping, as though he should never be old, there a young Shepheardesse knitting, and withall singing, and her hands kept time to her voyces musick; a shew as it were of an accompaniable solitariness, & of a civil wildreness Arcadia. \---Neither are the gardens to be omitted, which for their largeness, have the face of a for- rest, for their variety, of a Paradise; Here Cypres Groves, there walks with Statues; Here a Sea of fountains, there Swans, Ostriches, and other recreative creatures.

Soul,  &c. Scaliger defines It to be the Cessation of the souls functions. When Hadrian asked Secundus what Death was, he answered in these several truths, It is a sleep eternal, the bodies dissolution, the rich mans fear, the poor mans wish, an event inevitable, an uncertain journey, a thief that steals away man, sleeps father, lifes flight, the departure of the living, and the resolution of all. Feltham. Death had no sooner absented him from her eyes, but forgetfulness drew him out of her heart. When we once come in sight of the port of Death , to which all winds drive us; and when by letting fall that fatall Anchor, which can never be weighed again, the Navigation of this life takes end: Then it is, I say, that our own cogitations (those sad and severe cogitations formerly beaten from us by our health and felicity) return again and pay us to the utermost for all the pleasing passages of our lives past. Sir Wa Rawl. Death deprived me of my paradized bliss, and not onely made my broken heart the sad habitation of woe, but also turned my mind (which before was a kingdom to me) into a hel of tormenting thoughts. Torches made of Aromatique wood, cast out their odoriferous exhalations when they are almost wasted: So the vertuous A. made all the good odors of her life evaporate in the last instant of her death. That he is dead,---As if she now scorn'd life, Death lends her cheeks his paleness, and her eyes tell down their drops of silver to the earth, wishing her tears might rain upon his grave, to make the gentle earth produce some flower should bear his name and memory. \---She (prostrated on the body of her Lover) sought in his eclipsed eyes and dead lips, the remnant of her life. I shall not be unwilling to suffer a goal-delivery of my Soul from the prison of my body, when I am called to it \---Delivered up to the immortality of another world. This deadly shaft passing through him, so wounded me, that I my self was arrived within few paces of the land of darkness.

(Drawing neere to the confines of Deaths kingdom) Death frees a man from misery, and wasts him to the haven of his happiness. Her. As soon as Death hath played the Midwife to our second birth, our Soul shall then see all truths more freely, then our corporal eys at our first birth see all bodies and colours. Sir K. D. Desire , I wil tell you, It is a strange Countrey, whereto the prodigal Child failed, when he forsook his Fathers house to undertake a banishment: a Country where Corn is stil in Grass; Vines in the Bud; Trees perpetually in Blossome, and Birds always in the Shel; You neither see Corn, Fruit, nor any thing fully shaped, all is there onely in expectation: It is a Countrey full of Figures, Phantasmes, Illusions and hopes, which are dreams without sleep. A Countrey where the Inhabitants are never without Fevers, one is no sooner gone, but another comes into its place. There dwels Covetousness, a great woman, meager, lean, starven, having round about her, a huge swarm of winged boys, of which some are altogether languishing, others cast her a thousand smiles, as she passeth along; upon herself she hath an infinite number of Horse-leeches, which suck upon her to the marrow. Time looks on her afar off, and never comes neer her, shewing her an inchanted Loking glass, wherein she sees a thousand and a thousand false colours, which amuse her, and when she has sported enough, she has nothing to dinner but smoke. Holy Court. Albeit you can no ways quench the coals of Desire with forgetfulness, yet rake them up in the ashes of modesty. As Pharaoh longed to know his dream: so desired he to--- Desire (the nurse of perseverance) gave him wings to make the more speed.

She staid not long in the suburbs of her foolish desires. Desire is a wind, that against the tide can carry us merrily; with it, makes us flie. Feltham. Desire so blew the fire of his new conceived rage, that--- \---You, whose desert passeth my best endeavours of requital. \---It flies to the sacred Altar of your immutable goodness, set off with all the additions of greatness, which nature or affection can throw upon unmatched desert. \---This is the hard fate my just merit hath encountred. \---It is a matter so far above my merits, that I cannot think upon it without presumption. Despair of success was the hearse of his supposed idle thoughts. Love wanting desire, makes the mind desperate, and fixed fancy, bereft of love, turnes into fury. My Lords! I speak to minds too Noble to be stifled in the narrow confines of fear: follow your Prince, whose vertue the spight of Fortune, shall not wrack into despair. Whilst I wear a hand, commanded by a heart, that knows no fear, I shall not despair of--- all expectations, that I have least ability, now I have most need, to speak in the cause on which my life depends. What has your poor servant deserved to have his own misfortune loaden with your displeasure? Eloquence  is a way of speech prevailing over those whom we design it prevail; That is, if we will make it in the short or Laconick way, a distilling our notions into a quintessence, or forming all our thoughts in a Cone and smiting with the point,  &c. Mr. Hall in his Epistle before Longinus. \---A man, who (filling the sails of Eloquence ) as easily moved his auditors, as winds do the sands of Lybia which stir at their pleasure. His Speech appeared in costly robes, adorned with lofty and glorious language, sweetned by many a plesant and clear Simile, quickned by divers acute and learned Criticismes; My Cabinet enshrineth no such treasure. I much admire the very Character of your Style, which seems to me to have not a little of the Affrican Idea of St. Austins Age, full of sweet Raptures and of researched conceits; nothing borrowed nothing vulgar, and yet all flowing from you (I know not how) with a certain equall facility. Sir Henry Wotton. Though I have not Eloquence enough to win, yet I hope to find language enough to perswade. He was dazled with the brightness of her aspect; but when she began to unloose her tongue, never was Syren so attractive with songs, as she with words. \---'Tis a speech wherein the abundance of supereminent conceits choakes not the grace, nor doth curiosity take any thing from the propriety thereof. \---Your manner of speech is indeed Prince-like, flowing as from a fountain, and yet streaming and branching it self into Natures order; full of facility and felicity, imitating none, and inimitable of any. Bacon. Your conceptions are inimitable, your language sweet and polite, your Sentences are ful of weight, your Arguments of force, and your Words glide along like a River, and ever bear in them some flashes of lightning. How greedily my ears did feed upon the sweet words she uttered. Were not your affections stronger tied to the Orator, then the Oratory, I should not hope to perswade you, that--- Her. \---He, with a fearless fashion, thus bespake the audience.--- Every accent falls like a fresh jewel to increase her value. \---His masculine Eloquence was thought worthiest to enjoy the maidenhead of the Cities attention. \---Forcibly won by the smooth artifice of speech. It is no small dominion the imagination hath in perswasions, insinuated by the power of Eloquence. Bac. His Style was an elegant Perspicuity rich of phrase. Sir. Hen. Wotton. You have truly found out the Philosophers stone; for every gross matter you can convert into the gold of fine language. Eloquence does commonly storm the minde of the Auditor, and at length take him in. or rather with what glad devotion, I entertain you. Grat. Ser. \---You much honor me; for till this white houre, these walls were never proud to enclose a guest, the Genius of my house is, by so great a presence, waked, and glories to entertain you. Could this roof be capable of ill, your only presence ( Lady ) would convert it: There is a vertuous magick in your eye; for wheresoe're it casts a beam, it creates a goodness. I am much confounded for this honor you do me, Madam , but yet I am more ashamed to see you in a place, where vertue never entred but in your attendance. Ariana.

Mr. M ontagu in his Miscellanea. The love of men to women is a thing common, and of course; but the friendship of man to man is infinite and Immortal. Plato. The words of a friend joyned with true affection, give life to the heart, and comfort to a care-oppressed mind. Chylo.

As nothing unites more then a reciprocal exchange of affection: So nothing hinders the knot of friendship, more then apparent neglect of courtesies. Friendship a diligent Officer, takes care to see the bonds thereof fully executed. Friendship is the Soule of humane society. Friendship is a pleasant sauce to any temporal happiness. Bacon. The worst solitude is to be destitute of sincere friendship. boldness of the giver, whose true respects have encouraged him to this small expression of service.

In this place an admirable creature is to be seen, who is not what she is, and is that she is not, so many faces and figures she hath: She likewise is stil upon transformations, and seems to do nothing at all, but make and unmake herself. One while she is great, another while little; one while gross, another slender; one while affable, another while harsh; one while serious, another while gamesome, but ever slippery; and if you lay hold of her, you catch nothing. She goes forth of her lodging to apear in publique, as if she came into a Theater, cloathed one while in changeable Taffata, another while with different pieces, set together out of a singular fantastick addleness of wit. She alone represents all personages, talks with all kind of voices, and in all manner of languages, &c. H. Court.

The Babylon of worldly hopes-shews it self in the beginining, as a miracle; but if we proceed further we find those desires, that were as pleasing as the dawning of the day (which at its first springing appeares all over studded with Emeralds and Rubies) turn at last, and are changed into the horrors of a sad tempest. Humane life hath not a surer friend, nor many times a greater enemy, then Hope . 'Tis the miserable mans God, which in the hardest gripe of calamity never fails to yeeld him beams of comfort.

Thereupon a furious jealousie, as if it had been breath'd from hell, began to lay hold on this gentle spirit, all the objects of what was past returned to thicken this black vapour, to frame a cloud thereof, and resolve it into a storm. H. C. What is it that you should thus conceal from me? Be my ears unworthy, or my tongue suspected? Love, as it is Divine with loyalty: so is it Hell, with jealousie. There can be no greater Tyranny then jealousie, whereby a man continually murthers himself living. All his actions began to be translated into the language of suspition. Jealousie is a Gin that we set to catch Serpents, which, as soon as we have caught them, sting us. Feltham. Jealousie is the Canker of Wedlock. Jealousie continually studies the Anatomy of hearts, and shews great severity to the least defective part: Montagu , He is as jealous as a Turky. God and Man. Ingratitude deserves, that all the elements with their best forces, should conspire in its avengement. An unthankful man is compared to a vessell ful of holes.

Through how many restless nights, and less restless thoughts do we encounter these sweet bitter joys: And as the more we grasp the water into our hands, the less we hold: So is content the farther from us, the more we seek it in these fading glories of the world; which, like an Ignis fatuus , first light us through wilde untrodden pathes unto themselves, then through vast aiery thoughts they lead us up to that precipice, from whence we fall, and there they leave us. Her. \---This Charm reduc'd his passion to that contentment, brought his hopes to that height, and plac'd his Soul in a heaven of such divine pleasures, that he was even ready to expire in this pleasing Extasie. O what a source of joy did then overflow her breast, that treasury of chast delights! The Sun ne're met the Summer with more joy. the scapes of nature or breeding are most like to harber. Key of Cab. These Paper-presents are but weak reflections of stronger affections, yet being the best sacrifice of a friend, they deserve the higher place in your esteem. Letters are the sweet communication of fancy, which have been always esteemed the best fuel of affection, and the very marrow of friendship. Absence entertained by Letters full of confidence, is not always without its profit; for the Soul by the memory tasts what it has taken in by the understanding, and gives it self more leasure to recogitate its pleasure, which is not so well perceived, when presence drencheth the minde in a deluge of contenments, and gives it not leasure to bethink itself. H. C. If I write a Letter, I imagin Love gives me the pen, that I dip it in my tears, that the paper is all over-filled with flowers of affection, and that I send my thoughts and sighes, as courtiers, to seek out the well beloved of my heart. H. C. You have prostituted my chast and holy Letters to the base adulteries of all common eyes. Words are the images of cogitations. Letters are the images of words. I will not load your ears with those frivolous impertinencies, which would swell this Letter beyound your patience. An amorous Letter to a youthful heart, is a learned enchantment. The hooks of such Characters are artificial pick lock tools, to open the secret bolt of a heart. To see a leaf written, is like seeing an Army in the field; every line is a file of men. Words give battel to the minde, and overcome it: For there is no force more powerful, then that of words, to batter a minde. Stratonica. A talkative fellow is the unbrac'd drum, which beats a wise man out of his wits. wicked. good men suspect it for soft; and in the good, some spiritual men have given it the name of Charity ; And these are but terms to this, which seems a more considerate definition, That indefinite Love is Lust : and Lust when it is determined to one, is Love . This definition too, does but intrude it self on what I was about to say, which is (and spoken with soberness, though like a Lay man) that Love is the most acceptable imposition of nature, the cause and preservation of life, and the very healthfulness of the minde, as well as of the body: But Lust (our raging feaver) is more dangerous in Cities, then the Calenture in ships. Sir William Davenant in his Preface to Gondibert. Love (in the most obnoxious interpretation) is natures preparative to her greatest work, which is the making of life, ibid. Love in humane nature is both the source and centre of all passions; for not only hope, fear and joy, but even anger and hatred rise first out of the spring of love. Mr. Montague. To be in love, is the most intensive appropriation of all the powers of our mind to one design, ibid. Sensual love is the most fatal plague among all passions. It is not a simple malady, but one composed of all the evils in the world; it hath the shiverings and heats of Feavers , the ach and prickings of the Meagrim , the rage of Teeth , the stupefaction of the Vertigo , the furies of Frenzie , the black vapours of the Hypocondry , the disturbances of the Waking , the stupidities of the Lethargy , the fits of the Falling sickness , the faintness of the Tysick , the heaving of the passions of the heart, the pangs of the Cholick , the infections of the Leprosie , the venom of Ulcers , the malignitie of the Piague , the putrifaction of the Grangrene , and all, which is horrible in nature. Holy Court. Love! Care is thy Court, Tyranny thy Raign, Slaves thy Subjects, Folly thy Attendance, Lust thy law, Sin thy Service, and Repentance thy Wages. Fear breeds Wit, Anger is the cradle of courage, Joy opens and enables the Heart, Sorrow weakens it; but Love is ingendred betwixt lust and idleness, his companions are unquietness, longings, fond comforts, faint discomforts, hopes, jealousies, ungrounded rages, causeless yieldings; the highest end it aspires to, is a little pleasure, with much pain before, and great repentance after. At that time the flames of his chast love, began to burn more forcible then ever. He loved her with a love, mingled with respect of merit and compassion of her persecuted innocency. To love is natural: not to love is monstrous. H. C. Such was the unresistable force of his unlimitable affection, that in spight of Reason, he was enforced to do homage to Passion. Her love was a rich rock of defence against all Syrene songs. \---It received such an Impression of that wonderful passion, which to be defined is impossible, because no words reach to express the strange effects of it; they only know it, who inwardly feel it: it is called Love. He besought him not to make account of his speech, which if it had been over- passionate, yet was it to be born withal, because it proceeded out of an affection much more vehement. Humanity enjoyns you to love me, seeing I hold my life an easie sacrifice to enjoy you. It is no pilgrimage to travel to your lips. Worldly loves are the true Gardens of Adonis , where we can gather nothing but trivail flowers, surrounded with many bryars. Christian Diary. A silent expression gives the pregnant'st testimony of a deep grounded affection, where every look darts forth love. Nothing shall have power to alien my love from you. Let me draw from your look one blush of love, or line of fancy. Let me become an abject in the eyes of fame, an object of contempt to the world; if my faithful devotion and observance supply not all my defects. I am he, who either you have great cause to love, or no cause to hate. She loved him as the pledge-bearer of her heart. You---towards whom I know not whether my love or admiration be greater. Your affection hath got a Lordship in my thoughts. Love to a yielding heart is a King, but to a resisting is a Tyrant. (Sealing up all thoughts of love, under the image of her memory.) The extream bent of my affection compels me to--- Love in the heart is an exhalation in a cloud, it cannot continue idle there; it daily forms a thousand imaginations, and brings forth a thousand cares, it findes out an infinity of inventions to advance the good of the beloved, &c. H. C. Death may end my life, but not my love, which (as it is infinite) must be immortal. \---Him, whose love went beyond the bounds of conceit, much more of utterance, that in her hands the ballance of his life or death did stand. Such a love as mine, wedded to vertue, can never be so adulterated by any accident, no nor yet ravish'd by passion, as to bring forth a bastard disobedience, whereof (my very conscience not being able to accuse my thoughts) I come to clear my self. The proportion of my love is infinite. So perfect a thing my love is to you, as it suffers no question, so it seems to receive injury by addition of any words unto it. The more notable demonstrations you make of the love (so far beyond my desert) with which it pleaseth you to make me happy, the more am I, even in course of humanity, bound to seek requitals witness. \---(Having embarqued my careful love in the ship of my desire)--- Good God! what sublimate is made in the lymbeck of Love. His eyes were so eager in beholding her as they were like those of the Bird, that hatches her Eggs with her looks. Stratonica. He expected her at A. with so great impatience of love, that he would have willingly hastned. the course of the Sun, to measure it by His affections. \---He, beholding her so accomplished, easily felt the glances shot from her eyes, were rays from her, but arrows for his heart, from whence he could receive nought but honorable wounds. If you have as much confidence in me, as I have love towards you;--- Love is in effect a force (pardon the exorbitancy of the word): that is unresistable, so strong a war is that, which the appetite wageth against reason. Then, then in the pride of your perfections you paradised me in the heaven of your love. The rare Idea that thus (through the applause of mine eye) hath bewitched my heart, is the beautious image of your sweet self (pardon me if I presume, when the extremity of love pricks me forward.) Faults that grow by affection ought to be forgiven, because they come of constraint: Then ( Madam ) reade with favor, and censure with mercy;--- Why should not that, which is one, rest in unity? Bacon. His bosom was the Cell, wherein I hid my secrets; his mouth the Oracle, whereby I directed my Actions; as I could not be without his presence, so I never would do any thing without his counsel. When I am from you, I am dead till I be with you; when I am with you, I am not satisfied, but would stil be nearer you: united Souls are not satisfied with imbraces. Rel. Med In the intercourse of affection, my love surmounts yours. Fire comes out of the hardest Flint with a steel; oyl out of the driest jet by fire; love out of the stoniest heart by faith, by trust, by time. Eupheus. I cannot but admire thy love, knowing from what height of vertue it proceeds: as I will not envy thee thy death, so I wish a glory may await thy end, great as the constancy that advanc'd thee to it. Her. Two neighbouring Lillies, whom rude winds disperse mongst restless dust, may sooner meet upon their stacles again, and kiss each other in a second growth, then we our loves renew. Love is the good, Which by being diffused, is corrupted; she that loves one, another, and a third; takes in men at the coyle, and loves onely for her pleasure. The object of true love is but one: From the Infancy of Time to her decrepitude, the love between two hath been held most honorable. Heroin ae. Our mutuall minds thus combined, was like the Garden of Eden , wherein grew more delights, then either Nature now affords, or Art can express. Gracious is the face that promiseth nothing but love, and most celestial the resolution that lives upon chastity. She had a pure flame shot from heaven into her breast, from no other place could so generous a mind be fired. My love shall never end but with my life. There is nothing that belongs to us both, that can be divided: our wills united make but one mind, which ruling all our actions, it seems we are in like manner but one body. Ariana. \---He was so rapt with these dear engagements, that the commotions of his heart disturbed his mind, and stop'd the freedom of his thoughts. I must confess my self in prison, but 'tis a prison of love, where my desires, my thoughts, my hopes, my joys, are chains. H. C. Chast love. ] She changes the fire of Babylon into that of Jerusalem. Her hairs, which were the nets wherein so many captive Souls did sigh under the yoke of wanton love, are now (as the Ensignes and Standards of wicked Cupid ) trampled under the feet of the Conquerour. Those kisses, which carried the poyson of a luxurious passion in her heart, do now breath from her nothing but the delicacies of chasity. Her pleasing odours, which before were vowed to sensuality, are now become the sweetest exhalations from that Amber [illeg.]fle, which brings forth an odoriferous perfume, Entert: for Lent. My passion hath for its object a thing too perfect to permit me a thought that may be unworthy of the cause of it. I like that love, which by a soft assension, does degree it self in the Soul. Feltham. Your presence is like Himers Nepenthe , that can banish the sadness of the mind. The heart of a lover is a Citie, in which upon one and the same day are seen sports and bankets, batrels and funerals. Plutarch. Who knows not that love took away the senses of wise Solomon , and made him violate the sacred law. Love moved Biblis to be enamoured on her own brother Caunus , and Pasiphae to accompany with a Bull. Love is like a pan of Charcoal, which meeting with the wind, its contrary, makes it turn more ardent, or like a rapid torrent, which jostling against a dam, swells higher: so love meeting with opposition grows hotter and stronger. Dodona's Grove. \---These two hearts being dissolved into love, spake in thoughts, not having language enough to express their affection. H. C. Since then I cannot retaliate your love, or retribute your favours, yet will I receive them with a desire to pay. The worthy St. Dionysius , in his Book of Divine Attributes, distinguisheth three sorts of love: one is called circular, the other love in a right line, and the third oblique. Love (saith an ancient Lover) hath made a But of my heart, where, so soon as it had shot all its arrows; it threw it self as an inflamed dart into the bottom of my heart, to set me all on fire. There is nothing comparable to the Martyrdom of love: It is an exhalation in a cloud: It is a fire in a Mine, a torrent shut up in ditches; a night of separation that lasteth ages, and all waxeth old for it, but its desires. The life of this Young Hero , (which was ever hanging about the heart of his Mistress, ever in the contemplation of her goodness, perpetually in the furnace of love) wholly transformed it self into his wel-beloved, as one wax melted into another, as a drop of water poured into a great vessel of Wine, as incense wasted in flames. H. Court. He said what a warm lover (when desire makes eloquent) could speak, he said she was both Star and Pilot. No birth or estate can chalenge a perogative in love. The deep wound of his love, being rubbed afresh with---began to bleed again. Love is to the Soul, that which wings are to Birds, to carry us to its fruition. For want of wel loving, we apply the most precious thing which is love, to gain wretched creatures, as if one used a golden hook to fish for frogs, and a scepter to shake hay. I'le always dwell with you like your shade. I'le keep a Jubile to your memory. My eyes pay tribute where my heart pays love. I will repay your love with usury. (Love making in the field of his memory a muster of the vertues of that Lady.) The man that applies not himself to some love, is like a body without life. Love is the Wine of the soul. Love is the greatest Philosopher in the world; He can transmute substances without altering the accidents. \---A man, whose life needs no Advocate, whom detraction it self cannot mention without addition of some Epithetes of respect; to conclude him in a word, no object for any evil passion but envy; and a subject for no discourse but what ends with admiration. It seems Nature from above had been dispatch'd as a brave Harbinger, to score out a lodging for his great Soul, and give him a Body suitable to the vigor of his Spirit (so well was it composed,) &c.

Aristotle (that Linceus of Nature)--- He did with great nobleness and bounty (which vertues at that time had their turns in his Nature) restore--- Lo. Bacon. All the learning he was ambitious of was to be wise, and all the wisdom to be good. I find not any man, over whom he has not some advantage, nor any ones life, which (take it altogether) is so admirable as his. The Prince. He is an Anthony in clemency, a Trajan in bounty, and another Augustus in wisdom. Though he exceeds not in those vertues which get admiration, as depth of wisdom, height of courage and the like; yet he is notable for those qualities which stir affection, as truth of word, meekness, courtesie, mercifulness and liberality. He was Lord of great Revenues, to which his vertue not his fortune was his Title; his mind was richly embroydered with all the studied ornaments of learning, &c.--- Heroin ae. Bravest A. sooner shall the Fathers bowels be silent at the sight of his long unseen Son, then posterity forget thy name. \---Nor shall I rest content, till I bring one grain of incense more to that great oblation, which I hope the Muses will offer ere long in publick to his memory, thereby to induce Historians, (those Goldsmiths of time) in their elaborate rings, the Chronicles and Relations of these days, curiously to enchase this choycer Diamond to the delight and benefit of succeeding ages. Of Sir. I.S. The worth of worthiness hath his whole Globe comprised in his breast. The gallantry of his mind was plainly legible to every eye that was acquainted with the characters of vertue. \---In this man there were such great abilities of wit and understanding, that into what Climate soever his nativity had cast him, he seem'd to be able to command a fortune. Bacon. \---Men, whose Sentiments are Maximes and Oracles to govern the worlds beliefs and actions. Sir K.D. \---So wel was he studied in the Art of dying, that by continual Watchings, Fastings, Prayers, and such like Acts of Christian humiliation, his flesh was rarified into Spirit, and the whole man so fitted for eternal glories, that he was more then halfe in heaven, before Death brought his bloody (but triumphant) Chariot to convey him thither. His head did bear the Calendar of age. Every man is a vast and spacious Sea: His passions are the winds that swel him in disturbant waves &c. Feltham. A good man is like the day, enlightning  & warming all he shines on, and is alwayes rising upwards to a Region of more constant purity, then that wherein it finds the object. The bad man is like the night, dark obtruding fears, and dimitting unwholsome vapours upon all that rest beneath. Envy her self could not detract from his worth; he was learned even to an Example, pious up to a Proverb. \---A person that in the Hurricans of great transactions is serenely pleas'd to throw off the publick person, and adopt into his tenderness and protection, all that, unto which worth and letters may make a claim. Mr. Halls Epistle before Longinus judgement; see, but what a clean sense he hath of things, which does so overlook all his most perplexed affairs, that they seem to blush, they have no better difficulties. See, but how far his wisdom looks into mens persons, which doth so weigh them and their actions with the grains and allowance of their unworthy servile ends, that he seemes not more to observe then prophesie. See, but what an even spirit of Elegancy runs through every line, which beats and leaps as much in the description of his saddest condition, as of his serenest fortune; Insomuch that posterity will a little love his misery for her very clothing. Then, as a Husband , do but observe how kind he is, and withall how chast; how full of warm expressions of love, and yet how far from wanton; Do but observe how he weighs his own health by his wifes Standard, every line bears a Venus in it, and yet no Doves; and he drives the trade of thoughts between the Queen and him, with so much eagerness, and yet with so much innocence in all his letters, as if he meant they should be intercepted. As a Christian , see, but what a conscience he makes of Oaths, esteeming them (not according to the popular account) as if their ceremony made them the lesse sacred, or (as too many use them in the world) as bracelets to their speech, not (as they are indeed) as chains to their Souls; look but how he startles at the name of Sacriledge, though never so commodious a sin,  &c. Last of all, as a King , see, but what a constant and true soul he bears to Justice, which none of his sad infelicities can alter. A Soul that would come off true, were it put to Plato's triall, who said, That for a man to approve himselfe a true just man indeed, His vertue must be spoyld of all her ornaments. Key to K. Cabinet \---his Stature was next a just proportion; his body erect and active; his color or complexion had generally drawn more from the white Rose of York , then the red of Lancaster ; his hair neerer brown then yellow; his brow proclaim'd much fidelity; a certain verecundious generosity grac'd his eyes, not such as we read of Sylla but of Pompey , in his gestures nothing of affectation; in his whole aspect no swelling, nothing boisterous, but an alluring and wel becoming suavity; his alacrity and vigor the celerity of his motions did discover; otherwise his affections were temperate, and demeanor wel setled; most firm to his purposes and promises; loving Truth; hating Vice; Just, constant, couragious, and not Simply so, but knowingly, good. Sir H. Wotton, of the late King. So many excellent pens have written upon his brave Acts, and made them so well known to all the world, that it were to bring light into day, to go about to mention them. H. Court. He is the Pelops of wisdom, and Minos of all good government. Who has not known or read of that prodigy of wit and fortune, Sir wa. R. a man infortunate in nothing, but in the greatness of his wit and advancement; whose eminent worth was such, both in domestick policie, forreign expeditions and discoveries, in arts and literature both practick and contemplative, that it might seeme at once to conquer both example and imitation. Mr. Nath. Carpenter. \---Man, who contracts in himselfe all the draughts and works of the divine hand, and epitomizeth the whole world in his perfections, and bears the most animated character of the living God. H. C. He is a noble, generous, and well-manur'd youth, bears beauties ensignes in his gracious looks, has that supream Divinity in his eyes, as sparkleth flames able to fire all hearts: and the superlative vertue of his mind transcends his outward figure; he is wise, as most mature age, valiant in resolve, as fames beloved child, Reputation, conjoyns the masculine graces of his Soul with lovely carriage and discreet discourse, &c. Argalus and Parth. \---I could say much more of his worth, without flattery, did I not fear the imputation of presumption, and withall suspect, that it might befall these papers of mine, (though the losse were little) as it did the pictures of Q. Eliz . made by unskilful and common Painters, which by her own commandement were knockt to pieces, and cast into the fire. For ill Artists, in setting out the beauty of the external and weak Writers, in describing the vertues of the internal, do often leave to posterity of well- formed faces, a deformed memory; and of the most perfect and Princely minds, a most defective representation. Sir Wa. Rawl. in Preface. He was a man whose brave undaunted Spirit dignified his Family many stories high in the estimate of Fame. The excellent endowments of his Soul, acknowledged even by Envy, and admired by Truth, together with his known propension to goodness, invited me to--- I have been possessed with extream wonder, when. I consider the excellency of those vertues and faculties in him, which the Philosophers call intellectual, the capacity of his mind comprehending so many, and so great notions, the faithfulness of his memory, the swiftness of his apprehension, the penetration of his judgement the order and facility of his Elocution, &c. Bacon. \---He derived many streames from Sidney's great River into his own Chanels. His countenance (which by nature had no vulgar Air in it) grown lean by affliction, expressed (in a pale disagreement of colours) that the harmony of his individuum began its dissolution from the head. natural works,  &c. \---You whom nature hath made to be the Load-star of comfort, be not the rock of shipwrack. The errors in his nature were excused, by reason of the greenness of his youth. Nature having done so much for him of nothing, as that it made him Lord of something. Nature is the mirror of Art. \---They wrastled with the disadvantage of single nature, and at last threw it into rule. \---Then does Art appear perfect, when she can scarce be distinguished from Nature it self; And again, nature is ever happy, because she always carries a hidden Art in her own bosom. Longinus. Bacon. \---Assuring you in the faith of a friend, that you shall deposit it in the deepest and darkest den of silence, never to come to light. It is hard to be silent, &c. since nature hath not made us like Crocodiles , who are said to have eyes to weep, and not a tongue to complain. I hope I shall finde your ears faithful Treasurers. I will cover it under the vail of silence. Silence, in bashful signs, blush'd out a dumb reply. \---Till when I look these projects in the closet of your secrecy. There followed so deep and unbroken a silence, that midnight seem'd thunder, if compar'd to it. The silence of the Tongue is the peace of the heart. Tho. A Kemp. Similitudes, See Comparisons, Page 58. the only friend to solitariness, enemy to company, and heir to desperation. Though his attached tongue could pay no tribute to his dumb sorrow, yet did his silent woes shew his speaking grief. O happy Portia ! thy dead sad woes are all buried in my long liv'd griefs; and Hecuba's tears are all drowned in the sea of my sorrow. Lymbecks were her eyes of tears, a furnace was her breast of scalding sighes, a constant feaver surprized her joynts, yet with this did her sweet condition enforce a smile, and with this (mixed with a pearly tear) did she beg this boon of.--- Holy Court. \---Whereat the yce of his heart dissolved, and began already to evaporate through his eyes. He endeavored to speak; but the more he strove, the more the sobs choaked up his words. \---Assaulted with a furious squadron of remediless dolours. (Drenched in a Sea of sorrow.--- Love, jealousie, anger and sorrow divided his heart, and drew strange sighs from him. He bare the image of his Sorrow in his dejected countenance. He knew not how to answer her, but with the moist dew of his eyes, which began to do the office of his lips. She made the apple of her weeping eyes speak to him in continual prayers. \---(after the Flood of her tears was grown to an ebb,) \---After she had bathed the beauty of her eyes in the sorrow of her tears.--- My grief was at the highest before, and now like swelling Nilus it disdaineth bounds. That (washing anew her face in the balmy drops of her love-distilling tears) she began.--- He banished both sleep and food, as enemies to his mourning, which passion perswaded him was reasonable: He opened his mouth, as a Floodgate of sorrow. I had in the furnace of my agonies, this refreshing. The breath, almost formed into words, was again stopt by her, and turned into sighes. Let the tribute-offer of my tears procure- \---It deserves of me a further degree of sorrow, then tears. \---Finding by the pitiful oration of a languishing behaviour, and the easily deciphering Character of a sorrowful face, that--- \---With a demeanor, where, in the book of beauty, there was nothing to be read but sorrow, for kindeness was blotted out, and anger was never there. Suffer not the weakness of sorrow, to conquer the strength of your vertues. \---His Soul drinking up woe with great draughts. \---Her tears were like, when a few April drops are scattered by a gentle Zephirus among fine coloured flowers. She painted out the lightsome colours of affection, shaded with the deepest shadows of sorrow. \---Suffering her sorrow to melt it self into an abundance of tears, and giving grief a free do- minion. At length letting her tongue go (as dolorous thoughts guided it) she thus (with lamentable de- meanor) spake,--- Wilt thou give my sorrows no truce? Tears and sighes interrupt my speech, and force me to give my self over to private sorrow. Though my memory be a continued Record of much sorrow, yet among the many stories grief hath engraven in me, there is none to be compared with the disaster of--- \---This said, she wept the rest. But he not daunted at that majesty of sorow that sate inthron'd in Crystal; nor at her words, that would charm the most inhumane: but rather whet, then refin'd in passion, unloads his lust.--- Her. \---She, in whom sorrow had swell'd it self so high, that rather then break out, it threatned to break her heart. \---Appearing in his countenance a doleful Copy of what he would relate. \---(Able to make an Adamant turn Niobe ) When I am bereft of thee, in whom all my joys are so wealthily summ'd up, that thy loss will make my life my greatest curse, then will I dye in honor, and think it fitter for my fame, then linger out my life in sorrow. Her. She was Empress of a minde, unconquered of sin or sorrow Tis not the tears of our eys only but of our friends also, that doe exhaust the current of our sorrows, which falling into many streams run more peaceably, and are contented with a narrower channel. She melts her heart in a sacred Limbeck of love, and distills it out by her eyes. They resented his loss with as many griefs, as his desert and their good nature could produce in them. Arc. To give over sorrow I must of necessity give over remembring you, and that can I not, but with my life. \---To see her countenance (though which there shin'd a lovely majesty, even to the captivating of admiring Souls) now altered to a frightful paleness, and the terrors of a gastly look.

Sorrow having clos'd up all the entries of thy mind. He made a shady tree his pavillion, with intention to make forgetting sleep comfort a sorrowfull memory. He gave such tokens of true felt sorrow, as no imagination could conceive greater. Compassion procured his eyes with tears to give testimony. \---He departed, as if he had been the Coffin that carried himself away. The river of your tears (if not stopped) will soon lose their fountain. \---Pitie my sorrows, which are onely mine, because I am extreamly yours. \---Lost in my thoughts, I see my self wandring in various objects, and for a height in misery, I walk in the night of a heart darkned with sadnesse. The melancholy complexion of my mind inclines to hold a sympathy with all sorrow, that my senses communicate to me. The remembrance of her former ingratitudes delivered over such feeling arguments of her sad remorse, as were able to strike the water of tears out of the stoniest hearts of her beholders: Like the Rod of Moses , which drove water out of the Rock,  &c. Sir To. Math. \---A subject I confesse so full of lamentation and horror, as would require some Homer to express it, or rather the mind and pen of Horaclitus , to weep and write together. Suffer mine eyes to discourse my griefs. You temporize with sorrow, mine is sincere. \---Untill mine eyes became the sad oblation of a fainting voyce. It is hard to describe with what affection her eyes, big with grief, brought forth tears. The fair Lady in that Art resembled Aurora in travel of the day. Her tears much exceeded the morning dew in beauty. Stratonica. hath within himself. Sir. K. Digby. Reason is as it were the Soul of speech. Bacon. Lecture is the aliment of Speech.

What a paradise of unspotted goodness his filthy Thoughts sought to defile? \---(Thinking to set my mutinous Thoughts at peace.)

Thus when my Thoughts are at a stand, and can raise my present happiness no higher, let me call to mind how--- \---Since you have tied you Thoughts in so wistul a knot.

Others by the riches and pomps of the world, others by honours and dignities, others by the spirit of industry, and others by deeds of arms and policy. Every one sets out himself to be seen and esteemed in the world. It seems life is made for nothing, but to be shewed, and that we should always live, for that which makes us dye. Holy Court.

Vertue is the tenure, by which we hold of heaven: without this we are but Outlaws, that cannot claim protection. Feltham. Vertue hath nothing to do with the vail of untruths to cover it. Vertue is as the Geometrical Cube , on what side soever it is cast, it always finds his Basis. Vertue and grace run parallel with heaven. is, only so much more imperfect, as they are created the weaker vessels. \---She, whose vertue deserves to be consecrated with a pen of adamant in the Temple of Eternity, since she is able to dazel the eyes of the most hardy, to fill the mouthes of the most eloquent, and ravish the mindes of those, who admire nothing vulgar. H. C. Ask Sense what she is: Sense will tell us, Her face is the unclouded welkin in the infancy of day; her eyes the Sun and Moon that sleep by turns, lest they should leave the world in darkness: her tongue the harmony of Spheres and Nature: her breasts heavens milky way, spangled with azure stars: her arms Castor and Pollux : her other parts because of lower function, are but the Symmetry of all the beauties of her sex: she is too much first to have any second, from the third, fourth and fifth form of women, from a million or all of them, you may take some peece of her, not all, sot she her self is the All. Ask Reason what she is: Reason wil tell you, she is her Directress, that she keeps the elements at peace within us: our fire she confines to religious zeal, and suffers it not to enflame either to lust or superstition. our watry element she hath designed to quench unlawful flames, &c.--- Ask faith what she is: Faith will tell you, she hath yours and mine, and an hundred other souls in one soul, &c.---Were there, or were there no night: yet were she an everlasting day.

Heroin ae. \---Those eyes more eloquent then all Rhetorick, that would raise an Anchoret from his grave, and turn the Fiend Fury, into the Cherubin Pitty--- Those white and red Roses (which no rain, but what fel from those heavenly eyes) could colour or sweeten. Those lips that stain the rubies, and make the roses blush, those lips that command the scarlet coloured morn into a cloud to hide his shame: That breath, which makes us all Chamae lions, should be wasted into unregarded sighes: Those breasts eternally chaste and white as the Alpes: those legs, columns of the fairest Parian marble, columns that support this monument of all pens,---her skin, smooth as the face of youth, soft as a bed of violets, white as the Queen of innocence, sweet as bean blossoms after rain,  &c. \---She, shaking off those glorious loads of state, retired from the crowding tumults of the Court, into a solitary and truly happy Country-condition, there to spin out her thred of life at her homely distaff, where we will leave her a verier wonder, then the Phoenix in the desart, the alone paragon of all peerless perfections. Her actions (so above the Criticism of my purblind judgment) I am not able to comprehend, much less contradict or controvert. You are the beauty of the world, the pride of all joys, the sweetest fruit of best content, and the highest mark of true loves ambition. To her alone, it appeared, that heaven with a hand rather prodigal then liberal, would give what it had of most value in the rich treasury of nature. Stratonica. Women are Angels, clad in flesh. The Roman Story (big with variety of wonder) writes Lucretia the female glory.

In this, a very good Orator might have a fair field to use eloquence. Her eyes seemed a Temple, wherein love and beauty were married. \---So many things united in perfection.

Her voyce was no less beautiful to his ears, then her goodliness was full of harmony to his eyes. Thy heavenly face is my Astronomy, thy sweet vertue, my sweet Philosophy. You are the Diamond of the world, the chief work of natures workmanship. The patern of perfection, and the quintessence of worth. Your fair forehead is a field, where all my fancies fight, and every hair of your head seems a strong chain that ties me.

There's musick in her smiles. A mart of beauties in her visage meet. \---A woman in whom vertue was incorporated, goodness (which comes to others by study) seemed hers by nature. \---You (the type of my felicity) to whom all hearts, respects, hopes, fears and homages are sacrificed. \---Her countenance was too sweet, her speech too proper, her deportments too candid, to cover so black a mischief. \---She took hearts captive, and made them do vassalage and homage to her will. \---Where they found A. accompanied with other Ladies, among whom her transcendent beauty and incomparable vertues, made her shine with as much superiority, as a star of a greater magnitude exceeds in splendor the lesser luminaries of its own Sphere. Her hair seemed to stand in competition with the beams of the Sun. \---She, whose rare qualities, whose courteous behaviour without curiosity; whose comely feature, without fault; whose filed speech, without fraud, hath wrapped me in this misfortune. Eupheus. Nature framed her to be the object of thoughts, The love of hearts, the admiration of Souls. This is she, who is singularly priviledged from heaven with beauties of body, but incomparably heightned with gifts of the mind. Such is her learning, that she transcends men in their best farculties. She,---this bright morning Star, alwayes bears in the rays thereof, joy, comfort, &c. She was able to enthrall all hearts with so many supereminent excellencies, as heaven had conferred upon her. She had a strong and pleasing spirit, a solid piety, an awakened wisdome, an incomparable grace to gain hearts to her devotion. H. C. Nature in her promiseth nothing but goodness. He could not sufficiently admire the vivacity of her spirit, the solidity of her judgement, the equity of her counsels, and the happiness which ordinarily accompanied her resolutions. H. C. She gained hearts by sweetness, therein imitating the Sun, which neither breakes Dores nor Windows to enter into houses; but penetrates very peaceably with the benignity of his favourable beams. The eye and tongue of this creature mutually divided his heart, at one and the same instant love surprized him by the eyes and ears. Endowed with an admirable grace and singular beauty, to serve even as an Adamant to captivate hearts. Fair as the Firmament, which we see enamelled with so many starres, that resplendently shine, as Torches lighted before the Altar of the Omnipotent. \---She who was the Adamant of all loves: \---A Lady whose eyes wil make a Souldier melt, if he were compos'd of marble, whose very smile hath a magnetick force to draw up souls, whose voyce will charm a Satyr, and turn a mans prayer into ambition, make a Hermite run to Hell, &c.

Par. & Vienna. \---She whose beauty was far fairer then the evening Star, and whose vertue was more powerful then the greatest Constellation. The renown of her attractive vertues, and the vertue of her moving perfections hath so captivated my freest thoughts, that, wondring at her fame I am wounded with fancy, and my desire is--- I would willingly here draw to the life the Portraiture of this Lady, if my black Ink were not too unfit a colour to set forth a celestiall beauty. You have far more perfections then years, & more inward excellence then extern beauty, yet so beautifull, as few so fair, though none more vertuous. She had a mind of excellent composition, a piercing wit voyd of ostentation, high erected thoughts, seated in a heart of courtesie, an eloquence as sweet in the uttering, as slow to come to the uttering, a behaviour so noble, as gave a Majesty to adversity. Arcadia. \---Shee's a Virgin happy in all endowments which a Poet could fancy in his Mistress, being her self a School of goodness, where chaste maids may learn (without the aids of foraign principles) by the example of her life and pureness, to be (as she is) excellent. I but give you a brief Epitome of her vertues, which dilated on at large, and to their merit, would make an ample story. Were all her other graces worn in clouds, That eye, that very eye would charm a Lucrece. Her name (like some celestiall fire) quickens my spirits. I never knew vertue and beauty meet in a sweeter nature. Thou art a virgin sweet, so pretious in thy frame, that with the cordage of thy hair, thou mightst have fettered Kings. Thy voyce has mar'd the beauties of the night; when thou didst sing, the quiet stars would wink and fall asleep. I could gaze on her, till my wonder did convert me into marble, and yet my Soul would in her self retain a fire, lively, as that which bold Prometheus stole. Madam ! you are so large a Theam to treat of, and every grace about you offers me such Copie of language, that I stand doubtfull which first to touch at; if I erre (as in my choyce I may) let me intreat you, before I offend, to sign my pardon. Whether we consider her face or beauty, pleasingness (that charms hearts) and sweet Majesty hath spent all their riches upon her. Ariana. She breaths forth nothing but the sweets of love. The eyes are the wonders of the face,&dark figures of Divinity; we may call them too the Dials of love, which fastned on the wall of a countenance, shew with the stile of their looks, the minutes of hours, either happy or unhappy to Lovers. Fame, which is accustomed to increase the desert of every thing it would commend, has been constrained to diminish yours, being impossible to be published according to the greatness of it. It is a mark of great vertue, not to be able to endure to be commended. She was crown'd with a garland of odoriferous flowers, and her delicate hair in tresses, falling upon a neck of snow, did set forth the beauties of his divine face, whose splendor dazled mens eyes so; that there was not any one could support unwounded the sight of so many wonders. Lesser lights borrow beams of radiance from your greater Orb, which doth illumine and heat our Northern clyme with celestiall ardors. Ho. Conrt. Her mind, beset with thoughts clear and radiant as her own eyes; He that dares attempt the expression of her internal gifts, is ignorant of her sublimity; he who dares not, knows not her humanity, her sweetness. As no style can ascend so high as her exalted worth, so on the other side none can descend so low as her humility. Madam , if the duty (which commands me to serve all Ladies) did not ordain me this obedience, your birth and so many fair qualities I see in you, oblige me to it.

Her eyes, swift, as the shoots of lightning, nimbler then thought, and bright as the polisht Diamond. \---She is of so specious a glory, that though she need not the applause of any, to add to her happiness, yet she attracts the hearts of all that know her, to love, service, admiration. All lips are opened with singular prerogatives in honour of this Lady, and are all dried up in the abundance of her praises. In her person alone, a plenitude of all perfections does inhabit. H. C. In her, all the most delicious attractives of beauty, and the most conspicuous characters of power, are assembled together. This Aglae was a Roman Dame of prime quality, having a delicate wit in a beautiful body, and powerful passions in a great fortune. She had been married, but becoming a widow in an age, as yet furnished with verdant freshness, grace and beauty, she had not buried all her affections in the Tomb of her husband. After she had a little wiped away the first tears, which nature exacts as tribute in such like accidents, she quickly plaid so much the Courtier in her slight sorrow, that she seemed greatly to desire, as soon as might be, to finish what she had never well begun. Holy Court. But by successe of time she felt her passion so much enkindled towards him, that she neither thought, spake, nor liv'd, but for him.

She in whom the sum and abridge of all sorts of excellencies are met, like parallels in their proper center. Herb: Travails. \---Whose listning ears were well pleased with the sweet harmony of her well tun'd words, and whose liking eyes were ravish'd with the sight of her perfections. \---She---the ornament of the earth, the model of heaven, the triumph of Nature, the life of beauty, the Queen of love. Her action was beautified by nature, and apparell'd with skill; her gesture gave such a way to her speech, through the rugged wilderness of his imaginations, that--- Her voice represented the heavenly seven-sphear'd harmony. Such an extraordinary Majesty shines in all her actions, as surely either Fortune by parentage, or Nature in creation hath made her--- Pilgrimes, who come from the remotest confines of the world, cannot see any thing in all the affuent wealth thereof, comprable to her. Insomuch that I wish all the members of my body were changed into tongue, and that I were nought but voyce, to be throughout the whole Universe, the trumpet of her praises. H. C. Her gracious Soul hath more Antidote in it, then all the world hath poyson, which will therfore in her affiction make her like the Sun, which shewes his greatest countenance in his lowest declension, and bring her out of it, like gold out of the fire, refined, not consumed. Lost Sheep. My prayer shall be, That your Fortune may surmount your greatness, and your vertue your fortune; that your greatnesse may bee above envy, your goodnesse above detraction: that your illustrious example may darken the ages past, and lighten them to come; that you may live beloved, and die lamented; lamented by earth, but joy'd by heaven, &c. Ibid. She suffer'd no mutiny of passions against reason, nor of reason against God. She resolved to work with perspective Glasses, of different, yea and even contrary kindes; for when she described her own vertues, she served herselfe of a Diminishing Glasse , which made them seem so little, as to be no more then a kind of nothing, But on the other side, when she gave account of her owne imperfections; she would by no means know them, by any other name then of Vices and Sins , because she took a Multiplying glasse to her self, lest else those Mole-hils should not seem mountains. Sir Tob. Mat. in his preface to S. Teresa's life. You must give me leave to adjourn you (for more ample satisfaction of this expectation) to those drops which I may perhaps both be able and willing to derive and draw out of the Sea of her perfections, &c. Ibid. I shall onely say in very few words (by way (as it were) of antepast, till the Feast come in) that she had a heart as open as day, in the exercise of bounty; But above all things, she was so perfect a lover of Truth, that she would no more have even so much as but disguised it, and much lesse varied from it in the least kind, then she would have sold her self for a slave, &c. Ile assure you this Elegium has no more in it, of the Panegyrick, then of the just praise; I am rather her debtor then creditor herein. She puts that in execution, which turns nature into admiration. \---She, whose two eyes were the Suns that rul'd my day, and to whom onely her absence did make night; she whose mild vertue and beauteous looks, were a soft, visible musick, which entranc'd the lookers on, and struck harmonious raptures into every chast soul, and instilled pure fires into every unchast, &c. Amor. War. A prety smile made a kind of day-break in her face She is wholly made of charm. \---She is the star that rules my faculties. To apparel any more in these paper vestments, I should multiply impertinents, and perhaps displease For I have ever found face commendation to dye wisdoms cheek of a blush colour. naturally delight in ordure; they are Bats, which cannot endure one little ray of light, but seek to hide themselves under the mantle of night; they are Horseleeches, which draw blood from the veins of a House and State, where they exercise their power. They are Syrens of the earth, which cause shipwracks without water: They are Lami ae , who have Hosteries of cut-throats that kill men under pretext of good usage. They are Harpies , who surprize even from Altars, and in the end become envenomed Dipsades , which enforce an enraged thirst upon those, whom they have once bitten. Ho. Court. A woman without devotion is like a Bee without a sting, which will make neither honey nor wax; is a case covered with pretious stones, to preserve a dunghill. The tongues of women are like the bells of the Forrest Dodon ae , which make a prodigious jangling. O God! What a dangerous beast is the spirit of a woman? It is able to create as many monsters in essence, as fantasie can form in painting. No Owle will live in Creet : In Rhodes no Eagle will build her nest: no wit spring in the will of women. It is an infinite simplicity to commit secrets to a woman, whose heart is as fit to keep what it ought to conceal, as a Sieve to hold water. \---As well may I collect the scattered wind into a bag, or from the watery surface scrape the guilt reflections of the Sun, as bring her heart within the quiet list of wives that will obey and love. Incestuous strumpet! more wanton then Lamia , more lascivious then Lais , and more shameless then Pasophane ; whose life as it has been shadowed with painted holiness, so hath it been ful of pestilent villanies. Her Carcasse (a better name I can hardly afford her out side) was the inside of a Sepulcher, her Head was unthatchd as an old Parsonage, her Eyes (like lights at the last snuff, when the Extinguisher is ready to make their Epitaphs) sunk low into their Candlesticks; her Ears, now deaf, now happy, (such was her tongue) they have lost their sense, her Nose worm'd like a piece of Homer of the first binde, offended with her breath, bowed to her chain to dam it up; her Cheeks hol'd, as the earth in Dog-days drowth; her Lips fit to be kist by none but by themselves; her Teeth rotten as her Soul, hollow as her heart, loose as the shingles of an old silenc'd steeple, scragged as a disparked pale, stood at that distance one could not bite another; her Tongue, so weakly guarded, scolds like the Alarm of a clock; her Chin was down'd with a China beard of twenty hairs, her brest lank as a quicksand, wasted as an hourglasse at the eleventh use; one arm, one leg, one foot she doff'd with day, and, as a resurrection, don'd with the morrow; her Bones (pithless as a stallion for seven posterities) the slightest fears might now make rattle in her skin; her Body (wasted to no wast, blasted with lust, as an Oke with lightning) was as familiar with diseases as a Physitian: To conclude, she is odious beyond all comparison: one sight of her would make the heat of youth recoyl into an infant continence, Heroin ae. The look of a lascivious woman is like that of a Basilisk , which kils Chastity by beholding it. Diogenes snarled bitterly, when (walking with another) he spyed two women talking, and said, See, the Viper and the Asp are changing poyson. Feltham. No Weather cock under heaven is so variable as an inconstant woman: Every breath of wind forces her to a various shape: As if her mind were so neer a kin to air, as it must with every motion, be in a perpetual change. Idem. Women are feathers blown in the bluster of their own loose passions, and are meerly the dalliance of the flying winds. There are that account women onely as Seedplots for posterity: others worse, as only quench for their fires. Our daily experience teacheth us, that there are women very crafty, and such as under a pure and delicate skin, with a tongue distilling hony, often hide the heart of a Panther, all spotted over with subtilty, as the skin of this beast with diversity of colours. H. Court. \---Women are more inconstant then light Whirlwinds; trust the Sea with feathers, or March winds with dust rather, and let their words, oaths, tears, vows passe as words in water writ or slippery glasse. Ar[illeg.] & Parth. No Hell so low which lust and women cannot lead unto. Her tongue is like the sting of a Scorpion. A Woman is the unnecessary Parenthesis of Nature. ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif)  signifies as much as ornament, or a well disposed order of things. The exterior luster of the world, is but a cloud in painting, a petty vapour of water, a Fable of Time, a Diall, &c. He that will now adays live in the world, must have a veil over his eyes, a key on his eare, a compass on his lips. This world is a chain, which fetters men to the Divell; but repentance is the hand which lifts men up to God. He that is enamored of the world, is like one that enters into the sea; for if he escape perils, men will say he is fortunate, but if he perish, they will say he is wilfully deceived. If it be needfull to shew your self to the world, be then known by your vertues, which are Characters of the Divinity. Let men know you by your good examples, which are the seeds of eternity, and of all fair actions. Sir B.B. I have ever thought the prosperity of the world was a current of fresh water, which looks not back on any thing, but hastens to pour it self into the salt sea H: C. The world's a Theater of theft, great rivers rob the smaller brooks, and them the Ocean. more bran then meale, more dough then leven, more rage then reason. Eup. Wine, Love, Play, Rashness were the Chariot which drew his youth to downfall. \---Constrained to obey the transport of youthfull fancies. Let me call to mind all the violent pleasures of my heady youth: let me sum up their extent according to those deceitfull measures I then rated happiness by: let me in my fancy chew over again the excessive good I then fondly imagined in them: And to all this let me add as much more joy and felicity, as, in my weak thoughts I am able to fadom, or but aim at; and then let me say, (and with rigorous truth I shall say it) all this excess of bliss will be resumed, will be enjoyed to the full in one indivisible moment, of that bliss, which a well passed life in this world, shall bring me to in the next. Sir K. D. in his Treatise of Bodies. \---So as whosoever he be, to whom Fortune hath been a servant, and the time a friend, let him but take the account of his memory (for we have no other keeper of our pleasures past) and truly examine what it hath reserved either of beauty or youth, or foregone delights; what it hath saved, that I might last, of his dearest affection, or of what ever else the amorous spring-time gave his thoughts of contentment, then unvaluable; and he shall find that all the Art, which his elder years have can draw no other vapours out of these dissolutions, then heavy, secret, and sad sighs. He shal find nothing remaining but those sorrows which grow up after our fast springing youth, overtake it, when it is at a stand, and overtop it utterly, when it begins to wither, &c. S. Walt. Rawl. in Preface. The harvest of his sins yeelded him now more increase of woes, then the lusts of his youth afforded him pleasures. thought good to sound the Foord at ful, by--- He took opportunity by the fore part, and (imprisoning his worthy resolution within the Closet of his secret thoughts) did--- He summon'd his wits together, and set them all on the Rack of Invention. Violent streams being once runout, the mud will appear in the bottom. \---Doubt (the Herse of my desires)--- To Seal the Deed of my purchased favour, is the Gordian knot I most wish to unloose. ---Who (during these tempestuous storms) lay at anchor in his own private harbour. To weave the web of his own wo, and spin the thread of his own thraldom. I wish he would repaire hither, that the sight of him might mitigate some part of my martyrdom. Assure your self, I'le be your finger next your thumb. He erected Trophies of his own dishonor, and covered his ulcer with a golden veil. \---Like Elias's Chariot, all flaming with glory. O that the Odors of my Sacrifices might ascend even to thy Altars! Your mind's a shop, where all good resolutions are forg'd. Our understanding is the steel and our will the flint-stone; as soon as they touch one another, we see the sparks of holy affection flye out. \---It bloometh in the eyes, that it may at leasure blossom in the heart. That I may see some sparkles of hope glimmer in my affairs. To gnaw the bridle of your impatience. He felt fiery arrows fly from her eyes, so sharp, that they transfixed his heart with compassion: Love, Anger, Jealousie, Suspition, drew him with four horses. \---As innocently spoken, as treacherously interpreted. They murmured, as doe the waves of a mutinous Sea. Exercise the vivacity of your wit. In a vast Ocean of affairs, he hath liv'd as fishes, who keep silence within the loud noyse of waves, and preserve their plump substance fresh in the brackish Waters. He sheltred himself with subtilties, as a Hedgehog with his quils. To behold (as in the glass of a bright mirror) on the one side---on the other--- As soon as break of day drew the Curtain of Heaven--- Virginity is as redolent Balm, which ascends to Heaven in a perpetuall sacrifice. Religion is the hive, where the hony of good Doctrine is made. He put them in the furnace of tribulation to purifie them. O what may not depraved Love do, since sincere Amity cannot avoid suspition. \---Comforted with the sweet rays of this bright day break. \---Which hath been sufficiently declared by the sequel of his deportments. She had not so much hony, but withall a sting. \---He so breath'd the air of ambition, that--- To as little purpose as to cast chains into the Sea, to tye the Ocean in fetters. It was but dust he bare in his hands, blown away by the wind of presumption. She sent it as an earnest of her command. \---He returned amply laden with victorious palms. \---He went daily hunting after change, in the infinity of forbidden loves. I shall offer my homage at your Altar. Ponds that are seldom scoured, will easily gather mud; So--- Your heart is the Altar of love, and seat of friendship. Upon my Virgin heart I'le build a flaming Altar to offer up a thankfull sacrifice for his return. My heart shall know no other love but his. Let Venus speed his plow. He received it at her hands with more content then the Paphos Queen did the golden fruit. Let patience conduct thee out of this stormy sea into a more quiet Port. How canst thou be a stranger to my purposes, that art the Treasurer of my secrets? That I may disperse those terrifying clouds, that threaten shipwrack to my desires. To feast his eyes, and paradise his heart with the beloved sight of his all admired and affected mistress. His muddy clouded affection eclipsed the Sunshine of her far more glorious worth. Casting his eye (the Messenger of his heart) upon--- Seest not thou these Trophies erected in his honor, and his honour shining in these Trophies? In vain it is to water the plant, the root being perished: or to--- I here vow repay to the debt of my error, with the interest of all my endeavours. \---I will not adventure my fortune upon the rock of this hazard. My business ( Lady ) is your will; my suit, your service; your service, my chief desire; and my desire, your favourable countenance. Your suit shall not be non-suit. They knit two hearts in one, and parted one will in two, and so departed. During these Halcyon dayes,--- He sailed in a ship without a stern. Happy in my self, because happy in you. \---Sailing with as many contrary thoughts, as Eolus sent out winds upon the Trojan Fleet. He saw the cloud afarr off, before the storm fell. She (great with child with the expectation of her friends welfare) longed to be delivered with the notice of his health. I cannot use many words, where every word wounds me with a new carefull conceit, and every conceit kills me with a fearfull doubt. He set up the main sail of his obscured glory, in the wind of her mill. Who (smoothing the angry furrows of his discontentment) seemed--- She gave fire to his fancy. What ominous cloud shadows the brightness of this second Sun, that she appears not in her all-admired glory. \---His wasted words died in their own sound, and all his hopes were utterly shipwrack'd. \---She gave fuell to his enraged will, and blew the coals of his displeasure. Her restraint is (I fear) like fire raked up in embers, that covertly will kindle, and openly burst forth into a flame. \---He (whose senses held now a Synod) was driven to such an exigent, that (not knowing how to avoid the Check without a Mate ) was perforce forced to--- My Fortunes admit of no such Soveraignty. \---Who swelling with ireful disdain (like the disturbed Ocean) breathed out direful revenge. \---He craved pardon till the infancy of his weak merlt were grown stronger in better deserts. That I write to thee, may be thy glory; and that I love thee, let it be thy happiness. If thou wilt live like the King of Bees, seek hony at my hive. \---Drowning the late flowing streams of his gotten glory in the full Sea of his preter-hard haps. His unwished presence gave my tale a conclusion before it had a beginning. I would her injury could blot out my affection, or my affection forget her injury. Reverence and desire did so divide him, that he did at one instant both blush and quake. \---Unsealing his long silent lips--- Happy in wanting little, because not desirous of much. His countenance with silent eloquence, desired it modestly. Beyond the degree of ridiculous But I fear I have given your ears too great a furfet with the gross discourse of that--- Restraint of liberty causeth more increase of that evill, for which they are so kept under, then otherwise: See whether a Dog grow not fiercer with tying. There is nothing so certain as our continuall incertainty. While there is hope left, let not the weakness of sorrow make the strength of it languish. More determinate to doe, then skilfull how to doe. Under the leave of your better judgment, I must say thus much--- About the time that Candles begin to inherit the Suns office.--- Sometimes he thought one thing, sometimes another; but the more he thought, the more he knew not what to think, armies of objections rising against any accepted opinion. \---Actions worthy to be registred in the Rolls of Fame. Occasions try'd him, and all occasions were but steps for him to climb fame by. \---To lose the reins to his own motions. \---My self am witness against my selfe of my own imperfections, and therefore will not defend them in me. To a heart fully resolute, counsell is tedious, but reprehension is loathsom. \---And thus have you heard my Comedy, acted by my self. To you will I repair, because as my fortune either ebbs or flows, amends or impairs, I may declare it unto you. \---Time at one instant seeming both short and long; short in the pleasingness in calling to mind, long in the stay of his desires. He talked with such vehemency of passion, as though his heart would climb up into his mouth to take his tongues office. Upon what Briers the fruits he laboured for, grew. Idleness is an Ant-heap of sins. But alas, how can speech produce belief in him, whom sight cannot perswade? I refuse not to make my life a sacrifice to your wrath. Exercise your indignation upon me. If your occasions can make use of my best endeavours, the employment shall be a favour. The hast of the bearer, admits no further liberty to Proceed. Your desire is with me an absolute command. Thus far hath your command and my duty led me. There is no man can better witness it then my self, whose experience is grounded upon triall. I have left nothing unsaid, which enquiry could make me know, or your command required of my duty. Give me leave to digress a little. I offer my weak and imperfect lines at the Altar of your favour. \---Rapt with the wonder of your vertues. Silent admiration was the sole Orator of my affection. \---Under the shadow of your favour. How much those lines (sweetned with your Character) have transported me, my endearedst thoughts cannot impart unto you. Be it your goodness to beleeve me, I will sooner cease to live, then--- \---Him, who will hold himselfe unworthy of that life, which shall not be employed to serve you. Your zeal to goodness assures me, No line can limit my love; no distance divide my heart. \---She appeared an Adamant to my fancy. As those easie errors (which too deservingly bred your distaste) may be redeemed by a fuller surplusage of content. Be it your piety to have mercy. Thou bringest hearbs to Jarak. i. Coals to Newa castle. Lines cannot blush; so as modesty admits a freedom to my pen, which would be taxed immodesty being delivered by the tongue. She made me (though most unworthy) the master of her desires, that was, and still am, a servant to her will. \---He (whose smallest sails of hope, the least winds did blow)--- \---After he had stretcht and tentred his wit, and set all possibilities on the rack of his invention. And longer may not I enjoy what I now possess, then you shal find my promises full laden with rich performances. As I only breath by your favour and live through your love; so will I ever owe you fealty for the one, and still do you homage for the other. He read her discontentment in the deep Characters of her face. The angry Ocean swelled not, as he seemed to storm. The Imperious Mistress of my enthralled heart. To imprison in silence. How great soever my business be, it shall willingly yeeld to so noble a cause. At that time (when he thought the ship of his good fortune sailed with a prosperous wind towards the desired Port) a contrary chance raised up in this calm Sea, such a tempestuous storm, that he feared a thousand times to see it sunk. \---She, who till then seemed to be a miracle of beauty, did now appear to be a monster of ugliness. If you will raise me to that height of happiness. They gave him the Parabien of his safe arrivall. Vouchsafe me your pardon for presuming, and your patience in accepting at my hands this--- \---This partly (if the great arterage of duty and thankfulness I ow you, challenge not priority) hath moved me to present--- I dare not give sail into the Ocean of your vast soul, which is capable of all things from the highest to the lowest in perfection. Like a man whose heart disdained all desires but one. Which authority (too great a sail for so small a Boat) did--- He made his eyes quick Messengers to his mind. Betwixt her breasts (which sweetly rose up like two fair mountainets in the pleasant vale of Tempe ) there hung.--- At which the Clouds of my thoughts quite vanished. Blushing like a fair morning in May. Do you not see that this is a sallet of wormwood, while mine eyes feed upon the Ambrosia of your beauty? Here I make a full point of a hearty sigh. This promise bound him Prentice. He thought so much of,---that all other matters were but digressions unto him. (Not spoken by Ceremony, but by truth)--- I am too unfit a vessel, in whom so high thoughts should be engraven. Thus was the riches of the time spent. Despair is the bellows of my affection. \---As if his motions were chain'd to her look. \---Whose name was sweetned by your breath. Most blessed paper, which shall kiss that hand, whereto all blessedness is in nature a servant, do not--- (Beautifying her face with a sweet smile.) \---Humbly besought her to keep her speech for a while within the paradise of her mind. If in my desire I wish, or in my hopes aspire, or in my imagination feign to my self any thing--- \---With all the conjuring words which desire could endite, and authority utter. (A new swarm of thoughts stinging her mind) Vouchsafe (onely height of my hope) to--- I desire that my desire may be weighed in the ballances of honour; and let Vertue hold them. \---More or less according as the Ague of her passion was either in the fit or intermission. His sports were such as carried riches of knowledge upon the stream of delight. Then she began to display the storehouse of her desires. \---Perceiving the floud of her fury began to ebb, he thought it policy to take the first of the tide,--- \---(Making vehement countenances the Ushers of his speech) began--- Hide my fault in your mercy. I'le centinell your safety. Your words to me are Acts, your promises are Deeds. You wrap me up with wonder. Can your belief lay hold on such a Miracle? Her mind (being an apt matter to receive what form his amplifying speeches would lay upon it) danced so pretty a measure to his false musick, that--- \---Clouded with passion. Never did pen more quakingly perform his Office, never was paper more doubly moistned with ink and tears, never words more slowly married together--- Fearing how to end, before he had resolved how to begin.--- \---Having the cold ashes of care cast upon the coals of his desire. \---House. The seat Nature bestowed, but Art gave the building. It was hard to say, whether pitie of the one, or revenge against the other, held as then the soveraignty in his passions. \---'Twas a Magnes stone to his courage. His arm no oftner gave blows, then the blows gave wounds, then the wounds gave death. \---Her hand (one of the chiefest of Cupids firebrands)--- By the foolish Idolatry of affection.--- (When the morning had won the field of darkness) I'le sooner trust a Sinon. 'Tis now about the noon of night. (Too mean a Shrine for such a Belique.)--- \---Carried by the tide of his imaginations--- But when her breath broke the prison of her fair lips, and brought memory (with his servant senses) to his naturall office, then--- I pray God make my memory able to contain the treasure of this wise speech--- Her arms and her tongue (Rivals in kindness) embracing--- Whilst the Roses of his lips made a Flower of affection with the Lilies of her hands. Your will (directress of my destiny) is to me a Law, yea an Oracle. She incorporated her hand with his. Then (as after a great tempest) the sky of her countenance cleared. As in a clear mirror of sincere good will, he saw a lively picture of his own gladness. \---My mind (as yet a Prentice in the painfull mystery of passions) brought me into a new traverse of my thoughts. I have not language enough to fadom the depth of your vertues. I'le reare a Pyramis to your memory. My want of power to satisfie so great a debt makes me accuse my fortunes. Such endearments wil too much impoverish my gratitude. How can I commit a sacriledge against the sweet Saint that lives in my inmost Temple? I am too weake a band to tye so heavenly a knot. The greatness of the benefit goes beyond all measure of thanks. While she spake, the quintessence of each word distilled down into his affected soul. Departing he bequeathed by a will of words, sealed with many kisses, a full gift of all his love and life to---. Having with a pretty paleness (which left milky lines upon her Rosie cheeks) paid a little duty to humane fear--- \---You, whom I have cause to hate, before I have means to know. I will not die in debt to mine own duty. \---She, in whom nature hath accomplish'd so much, that--- Imagine, vouchsafe to imagine--- His fault found an easie pardon at the Tribunall he appealed to--- O my Dear,---! said she, and then kist him, as loath to leave so perfect a sentence without a Comma. \---Dearly purchasing the little ease of my body with the affictions of my mind. I am not Oedipus enough to understand you, All things lye levell to your wishes. They began to imp the wings of time, with the Feathers of severall recreations. \---When my wishes be at anchor in so secure a haven. You are the Life and Being of what I onely esteem happy. (For the Heavens had made this the Rendezvouz where his misfortunes should meet) \---It is a fit soyl for praise to dwel upon. Thus great with child to speak--- You (the Secretary of all my thoughts). \---Which (as the Pole-star) is ever in motion, but never setteth. \---This is no Benefice, but a Malefice, a golden snare, a Carcanet of Med aea , a Trojan Horse, which will produce Arms--- He went like a Torrent, whither passion transported him, and where the blast of Ambition breathed. \---More fruitfull in strong imaginations, then Religious in choyce of words, and polished in periods. Your words are full of cunning, your cunning of promises, your promises of wind. He is a Phaeton of pride. I'le besome what I think. She was the object of his thoughts, the entertainment of his discourse, the contentment of his heart. My happiness being in the wane, or my misfortune growing towards the full. From a Window he sent his soule unto me by his eyes--- I remain inpossibilitie to do otherwise then--- That so I may be raised from the ground of my misery to the heaven of my desire. \---Esteeming more this instant of glory which I enjoy in seeing you, then any other happinesse, saving that which is eternall. To deny me this favour, and give me my death, is one and the same thing, To wander in the America and untravell'd parts of truth. He led our expectation into thoughts of great relief. Whetting his tender wit upon the sandy stone of her edging importunity--- Let purpose be made servant to more apt opportunity. \---Him, with whom compar'd, I am less then a shadow. \---If I should expatiate upon this subject, I could not be held a flatterer, but rather a Suffragan to Truth, The only Quint-essence, that hitherto the Alchymie of wit could draw out of--- \---But then, as though he had been suddenly ravish'd with divine afflation, and struck into a transport, he swears--- We utterly condemn and renounce ( as Atalanta's Apple, which retards the Race) that unseasonable and childish humor of accelerating early pledges of new works. Bacon. \---Rendred in an equal felicity of expression, to--- It comes in, but Ex obliquo \--- \---He died ( Sicca morte ) his own naturall death. \---Forcibly carried away (I know not by what Fate, against the bent of my own Genius ) to--- Fortune hath somwhat of the nature of a woman; if she be too much woo'd, she is the further off. You out-shoot me in my own Bow. Many strange and absurd imaginations came into his mind, and peopled his brain. Pardon my rude expressions, extorted from me by the nature of the matter. \---This is indeed a service, whereunto I acknowledge my self able to bring more zeal and good affection, then any other abilities. (Till these late years of frenzy)--- So we may both renue the fault passed, and with the same diligence, provide against future inconveniencies. That every one may understand, I seek not to balk any thing by silence, or to cloud any thing by words. Bacon. Your bounty (like a new Spring) has reviv'd the Autumn of my years. \---It took me up little more time, then Nature uses to bestow in the production of a Mushrome, a day and a night--- \---When this succeeded not, I travelled in my mind over.--- Thus like Noahs Dove , wearying my self with flying up and down, and finding no rest for the sole of my foot, I was at last forced to--- Cressy.

My desire to see, took away my sight, as it fares with those who are suddenly taken with a killing beauty, or gaze upon the Sun, Herb. Travels. \---I plead guilty to unworthiness, and all the imperfections you can throw upon youth or hast. None can think so ill of me, as I do of my self, the rather that your pardon may flow freely, and work a kind of miracle upon me, in raising my dead thoughts to life. \---Discovering my self nakedly, to my very thoughts. Be pleased therefore with your naturall benignity, to admit into your peaceful solitude this--- a blessing which the Author (alas!) dares not promise to himself, since by himself he is judged unworthy, and by others incapable of it.

Pastor Fido. the Fashion , or inditing (as we call it); the Hand-writing , and the Orthography ; though the two first are most considerible. Invention ariseth from your business, whereof there can be no Rules of more certainty, or precepts of better direction given, then conjecture may lay down of the severall occasions of all mens particular lives and vocations. But sometimes men make business of kindness; As, I could not satisfie my self, till I had discharged my remembrance, and charged my Letters with commendations to you: My business is no other but to testifie my love to you, and to put you in mind of my willingness to do you any service: Or, have you leasure to descend to the remembrance of that assurance you have long had in me; and upon your next opportunity to make me happy with any imployment, you shall assign me, &c. or such like words, which go a begging for some meaning, and labour to be delivered of the great Burden, Nothing. When you have invented, if your business be matter, and not bare form; not meer ceremony, but of some concern: Then you are to proceed to the ordering it, and digesting the parts, which is sought out of two circumstances: One is the understanding the person to whom you write; the other is the coherence of the matter; For mens capacity and delight, you are to weigh what will be apprehended first with greatest attention and pleasure, what next regarded & longed for especially, and what last will leave most satisfaction, and as it were the sweetest relish and memorial of all that is past in his understanding to whom you write. For the consequence of sentences, you must see that every clause do as it were give the cue to the other, and seem to be bespoken ere it come; Order and coherence in writing being that fire of Prometheus , without which all our works would appear inanimate. Now for Fashion , it consists in four qualities of your Style. The first is Brevity ; For Letters must not be Treatises or discourses, except it be among learned men; and even with those there is a kind of thrist and saving of words. You are therefore to examine the clearest passages of your understanding, and through them convey the sweetest and most significant English words you can devise, that you may the easier teach them the readiest way to an other mans fancy, and to pen it fully, smoothly, and distinctly; so as the Reader may not think a second view cast away upon your Letters. In effect, the goodness of words is, as the foundation of all Eloquence ; and he said well, who compared them to garments, that were invented for necessity, yet did also serve for ornament. But though respect be a part after this, yet must I here remember it. If you write to a person, with whose condition and humor you are well acquainted, you may be the bolder to set a task to his brain. If to your superior, you are bound to measure in him three further points; First, your Interest in him; secondly, his capacity of your Letters; thirdly, his leasure to peruse them. For your interest or favour with him, you are to be the shorter or longer, more familiar or submiss, as he will afford you time. For his Capacity , you are to be quainter, or fuller of those reaches or glances of wit or learning, according to his comprehension. For his leasure , you are commanded to the greater brevity, as his place is of greater discharges and cares. With your betters, you are not to put Riddles of wit, by being too niggardly of your words, nor to cause the trouble of making Breviats, by writing too copiously, or wastingly. Brevity is commonly attain'd by avoiding idle complements, prefaces, protestations, long Parentheses, supplications, wanton circuits of Figures, and digressions, by composition, omitting conjunctions, Not onely but also, the one and the other, whereby it comes to passe, &c. and such like particles, that have no great business in a serious Letter; By breaking off sentences; as oftentimes a short journey is made long by many baits. But as Quintilian saith, There is a briefness of the parts sometimes, that makes the whole long; As, I came to the stairs, I took a pair of Oares, they lanched out, rowed apace, I landed at Westminster, I paid my Fare, went to the Parliament House, asked for a Member, I was admitted . All this is, but I went to Westminster, and spake with my friend. Under this Notion somewhat may be said of Periods , which ought not to bee too long, not yet too short, QUO MAGIS VIRTUS, EO MAGIS MEDIETAS . All vertue consists in a certain Geometricall mediocrity, equally distant from excess and default. Some Writers have prescribed a Period not to exceed that length which a man may well pronounce in a breath. There ought likewise to be a speciall regard had to the cadence of the words, that the whole contexture of the Period may yield a certain kind of harmony to the ear; for Longinus says, The true sounds and tones of Periods may be compared to a great Feast made up of many dishes. The next property of Epistolary Style, is, Perspicuity , which is not seldom endangered by the former quality. Brevity , oftentimes by affectation of some wit, or ostentation of some hidden termes of Art, is ill angled for; few words darken speech, and so do too many; as well too much light hurts the eyes, as too little; and a long Bill of Chancery confounds the understanding as much as the shortest note. Therefore let not your letter be pen'd like an English Statute , and be sure to avoid fungous words, and empty inflations; which may best be done by considering your business, and distinctly understanding your self; and this will be much furthered by examining your thoughts, and exposing them as well to the light and judgement of your own outward senses, as to the censure of other mens ears. 'Tis for want of this consideration that many good Scholars speak but falteringly, like a rich man that for lack of particular note and difference, can bring you no ware readily out of his shop. By this means talkative shallow persons sometimes content the hearers more then the wise. But this may find a speedier redress in writing, where all comes under the last examination of the Eyes. First, mind it well, then pen it, then examine it, then amend it, and you may be in the better hope of writing accurately. Under this vertue may come Plainness , which is, not to be too curious in the order; as to answer a Letter, as if you were to answer Interrogatories, To the first, first; to the second, secondly ; But in the method, to use as Ladies do in their attire, a diligent kind of negligence; NON ENIM ELOQUENTIAM EX ARTIFICIO, SED ARTIFICIUM EX ELOQUENTIA NATUM, says Cicero . And Longinus hath this excellent observation, That Art does then appear perfect, when she can scarce be distinguish'd from Nature her self . And though with some men you are not to jest, or practise capricio's of wit; yet the delivery of the most weighty and important matter, may be carried with such an easie grace, as it may tickle the fancy of the Reader, and yeeld a recreation to the Writer, as Plato observes, lib.6. de Legibus. There must be variety, but not excess of terms, as if you are to name store , sometimes you may call it choyce , sometimes Plenty , sometimes copie , or variety , But ever so, as the word that comes in lieu, have no such difference of meaning, as to put the sense in hazard to be mistaken. You are not to cast a ring for the perfumed moding terms of the time; as to acquiesce, to espouse an interest, to cajole, to incommode, to have a pique against one, &c. but use them properly in their places, as others; matter & substance being preferrable before words or form. For, as a modern French Author says, the most excellent words without solidity of matter, are no more considerable, then the burst of a cannon, without Ball, which makes a great noyse, but does no execution . Besides, a vain curiosity of words hath so much scandalized some Philosophers, that Seneca (in one of his Epistles) says, Had it been possible to make himself understood by signes, he would rather serve himself of them, then of discourse, to the end he might the better avoid all manner of affectation. Whereunto may pertinently be subjoyned those excellent lines of Mr. Hobbs (in his answer to Sir Will, Davenants Preface) in these words: As the sense we have of bodies, consists in changes and variety of impression; so also does the sense of language in variety and changeable use of words: I mean not in the affectation of words newly brought home from travell, but in the new (and withall significant) translation to our purposes, of those that be already received, and in far-fetch'd (but withall apt, instructive and comely) similitudes. There follows Life , which is the strength and sinews (as it were) of your style, by pretty sayings, similitudes and conceits, allusions, some known history or other common place, such as are in the second book of Tully de Oratore . And (if we may credit Hermogenes ) a moderate interlacing of verse among prose, is not without its gentiless. But too great a mixture of other languages in your style, some (and those of the more learned) have compared to a patty-coloured coat, made up of severall pieces of stuff; other to Anacreons Swan, which had neither blood, flesh nor bone. The fourth is Respect , to discern what befits your self, him to whom you write, and the matter you treat of, which is a quality fit to conclude the rest, because it does include the rest; and that must proceed from ripeness of judgment, which (as an Author truly says) is gotten by four ways, by the gift of God, by Nature, diligence, and conversation; serve the first well, and the rest will serve you. In the close of your letter you must by all means endeavour to come off handsomely, by avoiding those trite and over-worn conclusions, Thus I rest, So I remain, Thus I take my leave ,  &c. and by taking rise from the next precedent matter of your letter, make your subscription appendant thereto. For the Hand-writing , if you attain not to perfection, it ought at least to be legible, and the matter fairly written, and truly pointed, with Comma, (,) Colon (:) Semicolon (;) Period (.) Parentheses () Interrogation (?) and Admiration (!) points, as the matter requires. Apostrophe's are now also much in use, which is onely a cutting off a Syllable or vowel, for brevity sake; as lov'd, mov'd, for loved, moved: 'tis, that's , for it is, that is , and the like. The last is the Orthography , or true writing of words, which (though not much valued by some, yet) I hold a quality so incident to a good Penman, that he cannot be said to be perfect in that faculty, without it; nor doe I believe one of ten, even among Scholars is well skild therein. And of these I shall offer you some few nice examples of many more, which might be added. NI or NISI, lest, as lest such a thing should happen: is without an a. MINIMUS the least in quantity.

SIR, presence: your excellent deserts command my respects where ever, your absence drawes these following salutes, as the testimonies of my esteems and well wishes. In your noble Father I lost a worthy friend, in you I find him again: you no less inherit his goodness, then estate; this entitles me your neighbour, that makes his loves lineall and sure; and as neither with decrease, so both to the augmentation of my acknowledgements; The power of my friend is a shelter and joy, his faithfulness my security, yet I love for worth, not profit. This name of Friendship I grant is spreadly appellative, but the thing it self as rare in experience, as lowd in vogue. Your fathers love I enjoy'd in calm times; I prove yours in the tempests of Fortune; My confidence assures me he would not have faild the Test, my triall proves you do not; a certainty that precludes doubt, and no less obliges my proportion'd gratitude. It were easie now (Sir) to say, were you under my Stars, I would be the same I find you; I would so, nay should hate my self, did I feel but an inclination to the contrary. Yet all this evinces no more, then what you please to believe; Professions and Performances are not the same; what I would be, will not surmount conjecture; your nobleness shews it self in effects irrefragable. I know nothing can make me truly miserable, but my self; and as well I know and feel in lowring times, how consolatory is the countenance of a reall friend; such your best self, to whom I shall always subsign my self. Sir, A most humble servant, D. W. SIR, defective; For (said he) Nature should have made a window in the Breast, by which we might look into the bottom of his heart, to see, when he speaks, whether his words be conform to the dictates of his heart, and whether that which we see without, have an uniform relation to that within. Trust me (Sir) though I quarrel not with Nature in this kind, yet I wish my Brest transparent, that you might see in what deep characters your affection is ingraven in my heart, and how really I am (what you have made me) Sir, Your most faithfull servant. T. B. SIR, favours, but Fortune has dealt so sparingly with me, that I (who have most desire) am least able to shew my remerciaments, otherwise then by a course paper present; yet I wish I could erect some lasting monument, that might speak your worth and my engagements, whereby, after-times might know that, though I had not ability to require, yet I had a heart to be thankful, which shall always pronounce me, Sir, Your most obliged friend and servant, T. B. misfortune to be but small yet; is my experience of your excellent worths both full and satisfied, even to admiration. With some natures, I confess, much salt is to be eaten, before judgment can be prudentially setled; Others like the Sun, or Light, have power to blazon themselves in a moment: This excellency seems to shine in your nobler constitution; and this commands my so sudden esteem and affections. Sir, you have then a servant, but he wants power to express how much he is so; If I say, all I am, is at your devotion, 'tis not all I am ready to perform, because desire and readiness surpass in me my too much limited abilities. You see then your creature and instrument expects but your pleasure for operation, as far as he is apt, yet some offices he will undertake uncommanded, (viz) his daily oraisons for your good, chiefly that which is soveraign; In which to make him more active, your consent and call shall be the welcom'st imployment the world can lay upon him. Future occasions may enlarge my expressions; I shall now content my self, that I have presumed to salute you with these generals, whom I have devoted my selfe to honour in all particulars. Now let me thank you for all received favours, for those immerited regards that began my obligations and continue my gratitude; for your late kind token, which was of multiplied value drawn from the sender. If these find acceptance, and their presumption pardon, 'twill animate him hereafter not to be silent, that shall live by being, if he may be (as he would) Sir, Intirely yours W. D. Madam, should e're this have been made happy with your presence, else I had not thus long hazarded the loss of your good opinion by my silence; since I confess to owe a debt to your goodness, which all the respect and service my poor abilities are able to perform, can never throughly satisfie. I beg, at present, but a continuance of your favours towards me; and (because I know you just) shall onely expect them hereafter according to the measure of my services, which I have faithfully devoted to your best self, in quality of, Madam, Your vertues humble honourer, T. B. London. Madam, this Banishment to be a voluntary retirement, I should account my self extreamely happy; for here we freely enjoy those felicities so much sought for in London , the fresh air, and singing of the Nightingale; yet I must confess I begin to be satiated with these solitary pleasures, not so sutable with my disposition, as the conversation of my friends; and could willingly exchange the company of Birds and Beasts, for the society of men. But pardon me ( Madam ) it was not my intention to trouble you with what I do or suffer, or to wish you where I would not be my self; but to beseech you to retain a memory of me, till I am restor'd to the honour of kissing your hands; a happiness daily desired by Madam, The humblest of your servants. H 5 SIR, repeat them is not burthensom; yet lest their loss might bring you into suspition, that I was as silent as their miscarriage makes me seem, I adde these to try better fortune; in which, if more happy, they know their errand, to present me and my loves to your devotion. If they stammer in the delivery, they best express my self, who (surcharg'd by your deserts) must conceive more obligation, smother more affection, then I can utter. You can mend both by the clearness of a candid interpretation, till both are able to be more articulate and plain; None can better expound gratitude, then he who most merits it. Sir, I forget not the delights of your ingenious conversations, those sweet (but too short) moments of my contents. I remember your ready favors, your reall endearments. I remember all, and for all am thankfull. Will you have more? More then this you cannot, I am (what I am) Sir, Very much yours , D. W. that; the favour to be the unworthy object of your remembrance, makes me even proud of my own happiness. The truth is, I wish no other heaven upon earth then always to enjoy your presence, that the influence of your many vertues may create in me some kind of goodness. But since there must needs be a separation, excuse it I beseech you, if in this homely manner, I present you with the service and best affection of him that is. Most happy in your acknowledgment . T. B. Madam, next after God I neither have love, care, hope, nor contentment, but for you: The day yeelds up all my thoughts, as a tribute to your memory, and the night (which was made to arrest the agitations of Spirit) never removes the remembrance of you from my heart; over which, as you have already gain'd an absolute dominion, so shall it yield you a constant sacrifice of an affection, which shall be permanent, as the Being of, Madam, Your most devoted servant , T. B. Madam, yet I reteine so much strength, as to tell you I am alive; and must crave leave to renew that protestation, which I have heretofore so often made, not to be willing to live but for your service. The scars of war in some sort resemble the wounds of love, since, those which I received, have not at all diminish'd the desire I had to serve my Religion, and these, which you gave me, have increas'd that passion to honour you, which reignes within my Soul. My hand has not strength enough to write more, and its weakness may serve as a proof of my affection, which shall be alwaies greater then my power, as the effects of my obedience shall ever be less then my devotion to serve you, all days of my life, in quality of Madam, The dearest lover of your best selfe. Noble Madam, in themselves good, as also because I take them not to be common. For these are the conditions, that upon most things, set a value; But could those be wanting, yet would they not want a high rate, had they no other vertue, then the coming from you; If their kindnes to me had bin accompanied with the characters of your own more wished Fortunes, they had by far, been more contentfull: whereas now, as they tell me, I have a friend; they at the same view add she's far less happy then I could wish her; Thus the same syllables make the same thoughts at once, both hapless and fortunate. But, Madam , as the news general, and your particular, share both in malignity, because both bad; so, I hope yours at least is at the worst; and by sequele upon amendment; and hopes of better is always a fair point of good fortune, which to make more sure, you to your self will not (I hope) be wanting. There was a Philosopher said, that each one is the framer of his own Fate ; and I am partly of his Sect, at least so far as I believe no fate so bad, but 'tis in the power of the sufferer to make it (if not good) better. And so Madam (I hope) will both your wisdom and vertue endeavour; and this by solid grounds and ways, without which the rest will be labour in vain. The task you have set me to this end (to wit) my prayers, I both daily have, do, and will perform; and if a partner in misfortunes might lessen the burthen, as some have thought. I cannot be without my part in yours. Nor, wer't in my power, should your Ladiship be a moment without better comforts. But I leave this sad strain till fitter opportunity, and rest, Madam, Your Ladiships humble servant , W. D. by little and little decay them; but 'tis my pride, that each gray hair time adds to the affection I bear you (which again I pronounce infinite) brings an inclination to a second infinity, and remains the onely excusable dotage now extant, turning my present solitary life to one of much business; for always to think of you, I esteem my business, my faith, my every thing. Your constancy can never find out a greater, then mine; for 'tis a vast one, and shall outlast all things about it; Therefore look that yours be as true marble, as you will otherwise answer the utter undoing of Madam, Your truly, truly, truly, constant servant. Most honoured Sir, injustice, and to request your pitie in behalf of your poor and long oppress'd Tenants, were to proclaim you hard-hearted against them; but experience tells me you are free from both, and your own works pronounce your worth. Onely thus much I am bold to beg of you, that the false informations of A. B. C. D. and others, of broken credits, as well as Estates, may not take place against these bearers, men of honour and good fortunes, and such as I dare presume will inform you of nothing but truth. In confidence whereof I assume the liberty to subscribe my selfe. Sir, Your very humble servant. SIR. had the happines to hear of your safety and health. The Relator had an accidental view of you, and I a real comfort. I was once made fortunate by opportunity to enjoy your obliging conversation, and engag'd by your noble endearments, but this lost, almost as soon as gain'd; so vanishing the chiefe enjoyances of this fickle life, so unlasting those contents we esteem most ingenuous and innocent. Sir, I have many ties to be yours, and not fewer misfortunes, that I may not be so, as much as I would. But this is a world of crosses, such as, though it has pull'd many down, yet has it set others up in the stead. And this must be so, since without a cross we cannot arrive our Crown. However, neither distance of place, nor intervall of time can change those respects to your noble self, that took both root and dare from our first enterview. Affection grounded on vertue, must parallel it in content, or be injurious. Your true worth engaged me in ever honouring esteems, and these I must be unworthy if I do recal. Nor are our immortal Souls so mensurated to place, but they can meet; though our duller clay be confin'd to the accident of commensuration; what they cannot perform by presence, by operation they can; remain where they live, and be where they love; in the circumference be disjoyned, yet united in the center of hearts, which is their life and Being; and this is God . Here (Sir) was our first union, and here, I hope, nothing shall separate: yea, each flying moment of time drawes to a more embosoming neerness. Sir, when we parted, you enjoyned me to continue you in my best thoughts; This not to remember. I account to forget my self. That I am not banished your memory, one word from your Pen would not only cherish and confirm, but honor and oblige, Sir, Your most devoted and humble servant . D. W. SIR, respects. 'Tis true, I wrote last, but this wil not excuse; Gratitude makes my addresses due. When you salute, your salutes are pure favours: still oblige, never incur obligation. If then I have been too remiss, I flie to the Asyle of your pardon; and to render me more capable of it, give me leave to add this qualification: That not neglect, but fear to be troublesome, caused the interval. Est modus in rebus \---I would observe duty, I have to be unseasonable: He that can light on the Mean, attains the accomplishment of Office; he that misses, may mean well, but is guilty of some defection towards an extream. But as that moral Decorum is the beauty of humane life; so a precise niceness with friends, has too much of scruple. Seemliness should not be transgrest, yet Friendship is not stern in her Laws. I may be bold with my self, and next with my friend. Whom endearment makes mutual, love intitles to a latitude of honest action. Sir, that I bear the stile of your Friend, is the greatest adjunct the world can make me happy in; I desire no more splendor of honor, no relation to me so pretious. My request is, it may continue; my endeavour shall be to deserve the continuance; not that I presume I can deserve it, but rather, that I hope, not by a voluntary guilt, to forfeit what you freely confer. Nor wil you easily (your goodness is too constant) reject whom you have (with so much condescence) adopted. My resolve is unchangeable to be, Sir, Ever and most intirely your devoted servant , D. W. Madam, Nature gave me, when she ordain'd you to be the Parent  & me the child; for now I feel my self deprived of those joyes, which your presence was wont to afford me; now I want those loveful aspects, wherewith your indulgent eye was wont to solace me. In a word, I want all things, which an affectionate Mother did ever bestow upon an undeserving, yet dutifull child; for such is T. B. SIR, I hope, will pardon what it causes. I have often heard of you, and once I saw you; and by the conversation of a few words, I perceiv'd plentiful evidence, that what I have heard of your merits, was answered in the truth. This your humility may reply, was too short a time for experience. I grant it; but not to confirm what both the Good and Wise by report had made credible, the senses should not be deceived, in their proper objects; and Hearing is a sense as wel as Seeing : and (if it follow the right Rules) perhaps as little erring; chiefly if a rationall hearing, to which I have som title by essence. Report the subject; that you are deserving, the reported this aver'd by wise men and good men, yea all men that know you; which I must either believe or be irrational. Sir, the truth is, I am so fully perswaded of this verity, that I am truly ambitious of your more acquaintance; and that this may be by pen, till more joyn'd aboads afford a presential intercourse. If your thoughts answer, no greater obligation can be laid upon. Sir, Your most faithfull servant . D. W. SIR, and that you write to me, my happiness; which favours that I may seem in some measure to deserve, I address these, not as satisfactory Acquittances (for such my weak merit, does not aim at) but as respective acknowledgments, which your greater goodness commands from me. I have now throughly both seen and felt the Bath , and as I find my self nothing ameliorated in complection of face, or temperature of body; so is the disposition of my mind to serve you nothing lessened, but does adequately increase, with the obligations of Sir, Your unalterable servant , T. B. SIR, my gratitude for your noble entertainments, and not entertainments: only but even harbour in a push of necessity, which I construe, to have multiplied the curtesie to many degrees of height. These to requite I confess my self unable, and to forget as unwilling. The mean of both I undertake, that is, to greet you with my grateful and remembring respects: which if you please to entertain in my sense, it shal be interpreted a new added favour, and speak me thankful. Grateful minds can acknowledge what they cannot retribute, and this is both my fortune and meaning. Sir, that I may be some imperfect Index, or like the Westminster Tomb-shewer , tell who or what lies here: You have or shal find in the center, a Neats Tongue , enpanched by a Goose ; next both tongue and Goose, like the Isle of Candia , swallowed up by the Turk; Round these, some few other Volatils , as lookers on, and though not main Partizans, yet not unimbroyl'd in the danger, for their curiosity. At last comes fierce Generall Cook , and fortifies all (as he hopes) with a strong line of Circumvallation , and, having perfected his works, sends the besieged captive to your best appetite, whereto they are left for triumph and conquest. Sir, now were it not for fear of making this our Post-paste over tedious, and comming too neer the heels of time, I could so compare these Animals, or their corps, that there might rise upon their conditions both Emblems and Morals. But this faceteness I will leave to your self and good company to recreate and better your digestion with. What I chiefly desire to hear in this point, is, that you have been merry in parting the fray; friendly accepted what was cordially meant; That you have vanquished the cruell Turk , the peevish Goose , the betraying Tongue , the wild Pouline , the long-nos'd Wood-cocks ; yea, that you have raz'd the very proud outworks to the ground. This done, I pray, you may conquer your worse enemies, and number me in the Albe of Your humble servants , W. D. SIR, durst no longer pursue this method, lest it might degenerate into the semblance of neglect. If vertue (for her better practice) be enthron'd twixt two extreams, writing (as an act of vertue) must also keep due distance with them; neither lean to importune frequency without leave, nor be benumb'd by the Lethargy of Omillion. And you, whose favours have always engaged me yours, will believe my aimes have no other end, then to be so, as well in forbearances as actions; provided I fail not as your votary; a crime I should hate my self to think I could be wicked enough to commit; and am sure I never yet was. Sir, you have, I know, received my former Letter, and dained the civility of receiving by it my humble gratitudes, for the liberalities it acknowledged. This wil not so far encroach upon the Office of my better expressions, as to repent that duty, but must again and again pronounce me, Sir, Your grateful servant , W. D. Honoured Sir, obliged by both, yet am by you debar'd, by pen, to answer either. You fetter me in the limits of ten lines, and these too must bee silent of your self, the best subject; I could observe your number, and yet be tedious, did I write short hand, or would I imitate the Lawyers length of a Chancery Bill. But I will not force a double sense on your sincerity; What you will not have in paper, shall warm my breast, those gratefull thoughts, and unfeign'd devotions, that vow and maintain me, Sir, Your ever most affectionate servant , D. W. Madam, bracelets, you commanded me to make you some Poesies for that purpose, which I told you was a work fitter for Poets and men of wit, then for me, whose Cabinet enshrines no such Treasure; yet (Madam) that you may see what a supremacy of power you have over all my faculties, I send you these inclosed; if any of which prove worth your use, the composure must be ascribed to the vertue of your commands, rather then to any skil of mine, which as I disclaim to have, out of a just sense of my own imperfections; so, must I always subscribe my self (out of a like sense of your worth) Madam, Your most devoted servant , T. B. Qui est tout de Coeur; n'a point de langue. Qui dedit, se dedit. A se convertitur in se. Nec fallit, nec fallitur. Uniss: una: unum. Lo que se sabe sentir, se sabe dezir. Wear this (dear heart) and prove as true In faith to me, as I to you. This gift shall tell you, that I do Love you alone, and none but you. No heart more true, Then mine to you. If you love, my love content you; For all love, all Faith is ment you. Cupid has bound me by this band, To be your servant at command. I find it true, though you are gon, That Love makes perfect union. Madam, then be able to demonstrate how little I enjoy my self, whilst I am absent from you, in whom all my joyes and all my felicities are so wealthily sum'd up; that as I live by none but you; so, were it as much in my power as desires, I should never be absent from you; But since Fate has thus decreed a separation, I beseech you let nothing make you forget him, who always remembers you, in quality of Madam, Your greatest admirer , T. B. Sir, and so great a mark of goodness in you, that I believe without your good prayers, we had taken up our quarters on Saturday night in the Forest, where we were benighted (a sad thing to think on) and lost our way; But being (as I say) arrived here, by the help of God, and your best wishes, I find little subject for envy in our enjoyments, not a Deer being left in the Park nor a Kid in season, (unless a woodden one) nor a Walk dry enough for a Spanish leather shooe; and, I am sure you will not envy us a little fresh air, since we have paid so dear for it, by the fatigues of a long journey. Trust me (Sir) these things (however you value them) bend my thoughts towards London , and the rather, in respect of your dear self, to whom I am (by manifold obligations) An affectionate humble Servant , T. B. SIR, Orbes harmonious; this Age had clearly confused him. For how musical soever those higher are; this I am sure sounds nothing but harsh Discords, and so lowd, we cannot but hear them; so unpleasant, that the din discomposes quiet minds. The way to ease ourselves, is hard, yet not impossible: but what is it? 'tis this, To elevate our abode: To Compose our own interiour . He that enjoys in time Peace, is not open to extern broiles: they may beat the out side, but cannot enter; batter the walls of flesh and blood, but the Citadel of reason is safe; and, if reason sway, wee fly up to mansions indisturb'd. We are all Citizens of the lower World, I grant, must wish its good; may deplore it's evils; Yet our own private welfare, ought to be to us most precious. This were a Paradox with Polititians (if not well glossed) and so I allow it (each part was made for the whole.) But our Placire stil stands; and stands in this: each mortal is nearest to himself. My own preservation lessens not my contribution to the Publike. must I bee, or I cannot be able? I must be able, or I cannot aid it. Of Aides, there is more then one sort. All were not fram'd for the same function, or influence. The Martiall blade, and bullet has it's office; so policy military; these we leave to the sons of Mars. Yet we have our duty too, and this is piety. Piety first calmes it's own lares ; then becomes instrumental to others reconcilement. When heaven sees mee at peace within, I am approved, fit to pacify. To complain of exterior commotions, and my self to be torn by the disorder of my own Passions, is an improper address, a mediation ineffectual: It was well dream't by Scipio , when he said; as the intelligences guided (by a regular Order) the upper Spheres; so ought our intellectual powers govern our own little World. Where the superiour portion of the Soul obeys the divine Lawes, and the part irrational acquiesces to the mind; in the mind (and all men) resounds a harmony far surpassing Pithagorean accents. Ah! (my friend) were mental and private tumults appeas'd, the civil would cease, and whilest these (with you and I) are setled, the civil cannot annoy us. A compos'd Soul miseries may try, cannot disorder. Whilst others then, fight for earth, and purple it with native blood; let us aspire higher enterprises; pray for their peace, secure our own. Let us fix our thoughts where ambition reaches not, where War embroiles not, where tranquillity eternally triumphes. Thus shall we offer our selves a piacular sacrifice before the high Altar of God, in our own condition acceptable, in alien behoof not despised. The incessant vowes, of Sir, Your most devoted servant , W. D. SIR, excellent prescriptions, for the Composure and regiment of the inward man in these times of fluctuation, whereby those that are at War within themselves, may know how to seek, and where to find a lasting peace, a peace with truth and endles repose, and those that are at peace may learn how to settle the Souls Militia in an unconquerable posture of defence against the Common enemy ; In a word, there's a volume of rich Apopthegms abridg'd into the compendium of your letter; heavens make my breast a fit repository for such treasure. But in conclusion, you evidence the vertue of self-abnegation to be one part of the Cargazon of your ship; For you stil work with the old Perspectives, by serving your self of a diminishing Glasse, when you mention your owne perfections; and of one, that multiplies, when you make the mole hills of your friends qualities (if any were) to seem mountains. Alas! what is my plain song, if compar'd with your heavenly descant; Majoras majora canunt . It must content mee to contemplate you in a higher Orbe, whilst I ly mudling here below, even Sir, The humblest of your servants , T. B. Madam, heavens have not ceased to shed continual  teares for  It was a time your absence, and Mars has frownd of great rain upon all our undertakings; nor can we hope to receive good news or enioy fair weather, till the rayes and vertue of your presence return hither, to uncloud the watry element and uncharm the fortune of War. Whilst in this sadnes, I was studying what might render my lines worthy your acceptance, the enclosed arrives with the much wish'd for news of---And if this prove in any measure an Antidote to prevent the contagion of sadder thoughts, which these times are apt to administer, I shall enjoy the height of my ambition, which holds no title in competition with that of Madam Your humble servant , T. B. favours. upon your noble self, with an address of thankfulnes for your generous favours, and free entertainments; But this devoir (by your absenting occasions) being frustrate; I am forced upon pen supply Wherein yet the most I can express to the purpose, is ingeniously to avow, I owe more to your bounties than I can expresse; more expressions to your high worths, then I can make legible. Which defect of Language (I humbly yet conceive) you of all (Sir,) have most reason to indulge; since your great merits of mee, and your own self nobleness, has most put it to silence. Be then as much above my feeble Oratory, as your endearments transcend my mean deserts; 'tis praise enough, as you aim not at empty Epithets, so your reall perfections are abundant and natively clear to be their own encomiums . I, with admiring gratitude, will remember what I cannot utter. Yet (Sir) take this unfeigned image of my thoughts; that from the first houre I received the honour of your acquaintance, I have singularly valued your self; and since you have bin pleasd to rank mee in the albe of your servants, and priviledge mee not only with your friendly familiarities, but also signal favours, I confesse my self bound for requital of all, as to yeeld to none in my respect, so to be ever (as I professe I am obliged) Sir, Your servant and votary . D. W. SIR, passionate expressions, I cannot but take as a civility, being apt to make the best construction of every ones actions; yet ( Sir ) that so many moneths should passe in silence, since I saw you, is enough to make me believe your Letter meerly complementall; these times affording many of your sex, whose pens or tongues can speak one language, and their hearts another. When I find cause to believe your professions real, I shal set a greater value upon your respect: Mean time civility invites me to subscribe my self Sir, Your humble servant , V. T. Madam, the honour I have received, nor do I bear so little justice to my own gratitude, as not to witnes my resentment, though great, yet in huge disproportion to your merit, whose vertues  & goodnes I hold in equal value with those of demi Gods: I receive the new assurance of your Ladyships favour, as a blessing sent me from heaven, which bids me cherish it and live, since I can relish no felicity without it. Indeed ( Madam ) I know not what Sacrifice to offer you for such a bounty; All hearts are made tributary to your Commands; yet none with so much obligation, as that of Madam, Your servant E. D. Madam, they had sate long, and at length hatch'd a Monster (meaning the Directory :) So have I bin long in answering yours,  & at length my dull Genius produces this ill-shap'd letter. Madam , if the faculty of my pen were correspondent to the devotion of my heart, I could say much, when as now I must be silent; yet not silent neither; For every cast of my eye upon your lines begets a wonder,  & wonder makes mee break silence. I have alwayes had your sweet person and vertues in a reverential esteem, and now the charms of your pen have hurld mee into new admirations; yet not so, as to forget the old, not at any time to be lesse then October, Madam, The most humble of your Devotes . A. T. SIR, it self of a fault by which the Judge must needs have suffered much from the offender, since the foulnesse of the Copy, is like to have try'd your patience, more then the worth of the cause can hope to have recompenc'd your paines; Wherefore these lines come before you to offer satisfaction at least to your civility, if they fail of giving it to your Judgment, and the course of my life qualifies me better for civil discharges, then for litterate satisfactions. You shall then, Sir , receive by this a return of much sense of your fair and obliging carriage towards mee in the examination of my papers; wherein I must desire you to consider the whole design, which aims solely at moral regulations, and does rather decline then accept any inducements to controversiall doctrines; if there bee any point so incident to the subjects, as my opinion must needs appeare in some dark light, this may well bee conniv'd at by so ingenious a Judge, as your self, who cannot expect I should dissemble my principles, though in discretion I was forbid to declaim upon them; So that I conceive your abilities will make a due difference, between what may critically be sifted out, and what does litteral'y professe it self, and of this last sort, I presume you will find nothing in the whole Work, that has an open face of contention or offence; Wherefore upon your animadversions, I have changed the looks of such places, as had any apparant features of enmity, and have offer'd you such satisfaction upon the other points I have not alterd, as I hope your candor and dispassionate temper may admit; Upon the opinion whereof, I shall conclude, that if you have found, in these my Meditations, more matter promising good influencies upon the affections of our Country, hen projecting any dangerous fusions, you will allow them your contribution to that effect I have singly proposed in them; In order whereunto my prayers shall intend the suppliment of my pens deficiency; which the lesse worthy it is of this exposure to the World, the more must it owe your patience and civility for your favour to Your most affectionate servant W. M. SIR, happy New-year. Nor shall I doubt the effect, since I cannot your Piety or Prudence . No revolution of time can be inauspicious, where these fair pair of twin virtues are fixt, and in action. Time tells our hours, produces change, but our happines, or infortunes onely from our selves. Tis vain then to accuse deaf Fate, when we are our own destiny, or at least it, in our arbitrement: Prudence , (the eye of our life) foresees, disposes our affaires; Piety , our selves. That discharges our devoirs, This guides all events (prosperous or adverse) to our eternal (if it cannot temporal) felicity. Hence we have a method either to prevent misery, or of turning it into better luck, by being unhappy. Cross chances I grant, are but sower friends, rather to be entertain'd then invited; yet 'tis too visible, none are more wretched, then those that most court fortune. Give me Indifferency, and I'le be fortunes fate, and fortunate, maugre her despight. As to time it self; the best description of it is to employ, it well. 'Tis a thing of so swift an Essence, that 'tis gone before we can think what it is. 'Tis the measure of sublunary beings, and proclaimes to us, (by its height) how fast we our selves fade, and dwindle away. The past is no more ours, then frugal usage has made it so. The future is not, and so uncertain whether 'twil ever be in our power. What of it we can own is only the present, and this so coy, that if not taken by the foretop, tis vanisht, like a Ghost, and leaves us nothing, but cause to repent and gaze. Ah! my friend, how pretious our moments! on these short Instances depends our whole Eternity. Temporal existence is as fickle as temporal happinesse; both participate of the nature of time, are fleeting. In this casualty then, let us fix on what is truely durable above floating intertainties, beyond temporall lastingnesse. Whilst our minutes fly from us, our selves speed faster towards unchangeable permanency; so we doe in naturall tendency, but let us by virtue's vigours. Each hour posts away with it's length of our life; The old year is gone; if our imperfections with it, 'twas well spent; if not, there's the more need we spend the New better. And least we live not to the end, let's take advantage of the beginning: make that our own that is so. Thrift of our dayes is th'only end to make our selves in time eternally happy. But I fear by this rude Rhapsody of the initiate yeare, I have wasted your hour-glass too much, rendring my prayer of your prosperous future, your present Domage; But pardon, because my subject ( time ) as wel as my distracted capacity fail'd me. Suffice it, I wish you more then I can utter, or need prescribe you the way to; and whilst you are blest, I partake, Sir 31 Decemb. Your happy friend and joyd servant. W. D. Madam, enjoyment of your wonted repose, which (had I bin General) no cause nor quarrel should have made me hazard; since in all things I value your content above my own; My regard to your safety had bin in such case motive enough with mee, to have suspended the chastisment of that mutinous City: Madam ; If (as I hope and pray) you are now both free from disquietude and from fear; I have my hearts wish; desiring (as you know) nothing more, then by continued devotion to your self and service, to purchase at length the esteem of: Madam; Your most faithfull servant , B. T. Madam, issue of that Monster; To say your Ladyship is guilty of both in some kind, is a truth undeniable: For ever since fortune made me happy in your knowledge, my affection hath had no Centre, but your breast, my faith, no fellow; and my constancy such as can never admit a change; yet my sighes are unpittied, my love unregarded, my faith and constancy answered with nothing, but your disproportionate denials; Nor can I, without wonder, consider, that your Ladyship should be to all the world so perfectly charitable, to mee so cruell, unless 'twere ordained by fate, That the first fruits of my love (which should be the first step to happiness) must be made abortive by your incompassion. Madam , the more you deny, the more fuel you add to those flames, which (if not suddenly allai'd by your pittie) will consume my very being into ashes of mortalitie; These are Madam , the reall dictates of a heart, that's wholly devoted To serve you , T: B. born. Honoured Madam, assisted with reasons to bear the cause of its griefs. That you are both sad and grieved, I can no more doubt, then I can be without a share in your passions. That you have many comforters, because friends, many solid considerations from your own pietie and pious wisdom to salve your sorrowes, I am as confident; Yet, as none more tenders your happinesse then my self, so could not I alone be silent in this motive of your teares; what I would say is; Dearest Madam , be comforted, and this (were's in my power) I would effect. The reason of your sable thoughts, the spring that streames your cheekes, rise I know from the sad accident of your childs death. It was I confess the first image of your likenes, the first blessing that heaven honored your body with, the first pledge of nature, the first title you had to be a Mother. And to bee deprived of this, almost as soon as 'twas given, could not but find and afford matter both for teares and grief; in a disposition so natural and good. But Madam , there's a time for all, and a meane also. What could not be denied to your sweetness, must be moderated by your discretion. 'Tis true, that sweet infant was yours, 'twas your first, 'twas dear, and you suffered many dolours, to give it life; But withall you consider, as 'twas yours, so given you by God; as the first, so more due to him; as dear, yet could it not be too dear for him that hath it; Although of painfull birth; yet that your throwes brought forth a Saint, that your dolours were endured, so soon to enthrone a part of your self among the Angels; these dolours, these throwes, happily suffered. Those whom God makes Parents, he makes but Nurses of his own children, he lends them to be brought up for heaven: and if hee hath so soon discharged you of this obligation, risk not so much a cross, as a blessing; Had it lived to mature age, perhaps he saw danger both to It and you: it might have been more cause of grief to you, more loss to it self; it might have been unfortunate in life, in death unhappy; 'Tis not the being children of either good or great extract that makes them alwayes either good or happy. And this perhaps God (that provident Parent of all) foresaw. Be it so, or not; certain it is, the bodie is but the Souls prison, wherein 'tis no sooner breathed from Heaven, but 'tis maculated by this corrupt Earth: and in this as it longer soiournes, so is it not only debarred of its true happiness and welfare, but also offends its great Creator; and consequently is miserable, Therefore would God make the cradle of yours, its death bed, that he might hasten its blisse. As he breathed a pure Soul into it, so would he again take it before defiled by the actual blemishes of sin. Had it liv'd, it could have afforded no comfort to your piety, but being in health, prosperity, and pious; and can it be more pious, then in heaven, more prosperous, then in heavens joyes, more health ful then in the enjoyance of immortality? O consider, tis now past all danger, 'tis freed from all misery, 'tis blessed in blessedness, it prayes for you. And can there be any sorrow so great that these considerations cannot consolate? O what more happy then to be so happy a Mother; no sooner a Mother, then a Mother to heaven. Nor doubt (dear Madam ,) but hee that gave you this dear pledge of his love, will give you more, and, as he took this to his own joyes, so will he leave in its stead more to your comfort. This he took to give it as soon happiness as being, and therein to try your virtue and resignation to his will: this as I doubt not but he will find, so may you be confident he will bee bountifull: a sure rewarder of your patience, a prosperer of your Soul, body, and its fruitfulness. But pardon (most honoured Madam ) my loves tediousness; and if in this unpolishd Consolatory I have erred, let it be, as it is, loves fault, a fault that your noblenesse I am certain will remit. Thus with humblest respects he takes his leave that will no longer bee, then be yours, the daily Petitioner to heaven for your most wished comforts of both Worlds. Madam, your humble and most affectionate servant , W. D. SIR, receive two letters from you, without giving you humble thanks for either; I beseech you ascribe not to any want of zeal to your service: for in earnest you cannot make me more happy then in vouchsafing mee the honour of your commands, which shall alwayes find as ready an obedience in mee, as any thing that most concernes my own interest; In the assurance whereof I give you the humble respects of Sir, Yours, ad nutum , T. B. Dear Sir, advise in that affair; I well remember the Counsell of a prudent friend was, not to matry till I were 30 years of age, and then to have a wife ten years younger then my self; because women (especially teeming ones) sooner decay, then men. I have also read, that there are 3 principal motives to a wedded life. Procreatio Prolis: Conservatio Domus : and Consolatio vit ae . Now the gentlewoman you write of, instead of being ten years younger, I believe is ten years elder, then my self; and so may be in danger to frustrate the two first motives; by being issue-less. Yet if she have so many fill'd baggs as you mention, it may bee a shrewd temptation: But in marriage, Love (as you well observe) is most preferrable, provided there be a competency of fewel (which is riches) to keep it warm. Now 'tis like I might love the Lady you motion mee to, with an ordinary conjugal love, but perhaps not with an eminent dear affection, and on this subject I remember to have read these old, but well meaning verses. Who makes the object of his fancy, gold, Grows cold in fancy, when his money's told: And she, who faines to love, to live a Lady, Is honors Fawn, I know not what she may be. Examples are too frequent in this age of the infelicity of those Matches, which are meerly concluded for wealth, without love: Therefore in this (as a choise, whereon the happines of my whole life depends) I shall be very deliberate in resolving, yet ever glad to receive your advise, as being Sir, Your most respective nephew and humble servant . T. B. Madam, heartiest devotions are brokenly expressed, are Maximes in Humanity, and however Errors, yet venial. The discreetest love is seldom without some annexed passion, which oft-times fetters the faculties and leads understanding captive; that which did and justly might deter, doth now animate; The moon in her farthest distance from the Sun, and greatest opposition, receives most light; The poorer they be to whom charity is extended, the greater the merit; Worth gaines most honour by ennobling unworthiness; Nature never ordaind two Suns to shine in one firmament. I list not to expatiate in this kind. In the description of your worth this short expression shall suffice; That would Earths Monarch pay his devotions before perfections Altar, he need seek no further then your breast. To express my devoted affection by deep protests and multiplyed vowes will not please, my Motto is, rather in deed then in word . Till matters be maturely discussed, and the advise of friends on both sides had, I aime no higher, then to be enstil'd your servant; Deliberation (if in any case) in this is most necessary. I honour you too much to wish you the smallest amiss, though the sum of my earthly felicity depended thereon. My affection is no frenzy; if my Starrs mean mee not the enjoying of such happiness, I must frame a content. For conclusion, I will only add, that though you may have your choice of many in all points more accomplished, yet none that shall so truly love you. My lines are confused like my thoughts; your milder censure he presumes on who truely honours your worth and rests Solely devoted to your virtues . T. B. SIR, ship-wrackt in your good opinion, when my own Vessel was full fraught with respect, which I intended to dis-imbark at your haven. I am first to thank you, for your plainness and ingenuity in my charge, and shall assume the same freedome in my own acquitall. The story told you by Mr. W. from Mistris P. a womans discourse (for those I suppose the parties mentioned in yours) I deny to have been either Author or promulgator of, and must assure you, that such like, with other volatile reports were here before my return; yet I must tell you (since it so much concerns mee) that I had Commission to make some inquisition in the Country upon a preconceived neglect in you, and other rumours, but do assure you, what I said was with such modesty, and so short of what common fame delivered, nay with such regret to have said any thing at all, that it will hereafter appeare, I have been so far from being disaffected to this your service, that I have run my self into an Oblique opinion elsewhere, for promoting it, and I am confident the young Lady (when you shall be felicitated with her enjoyment) will assure you as much; nor indeed could I possibly have said less, in performance of the trust reposed in mee. Sir, if this give you not satisfaction, I shall be glad to know what may, because I profess to owe you much service,  & the more in order to that approaching happiness, which your Starrs have assigned you, whereto no wishes of a happy confarreation shall more readily concurr, then those of Sir, Your very humble servant , T. B. Lady, perplexity, believing that either the attempt of mine had purchased your disfavour, or otherwise (by some harder fate) I had suffered in your good opinion, then which Jamaica is to me of less value. These feares I must confess with-held mee till now from a second address of service, though not from offering continuall thoughts of respect to your merit, and of perfect obedience to your commands, nor shall I longer live, then breath the air of such devotion, being professedly, Lady, Yours in firme affection , T. B. SIR. I am (as you say) indeed alwaies pleased to accept, what time permits you to write. Your lines please, and cannot chuse, being full of erudition, full of love, and guided by a judgement not vulgar; And, what ever your time is, your mentall store failes not: what others, with many a scratch'd brow, cannot invent, you with facility dictate, and as copiously pen; Then for my acceptance, there's no benignity required, but gratitude, and gratitude not common, but such as ought to quadre with merits, unparalleld. That you daigne to entertain mine but with a superficial view, adds honour and value, adds courage and alacrity. We see many things carry price, not from innate worth, but the esteemers fancy: So Jewels and other rarities, which humane estimate and not nature, have made pretious, The rule is Opinion ; and if any mans approbation could make my lines accurate (that is, what they are not) sooner to yours should I yeeld the efficiency, and with much reason; for there's none I approve more. Whilst I am jejune and empty, you are polite, and, even upon my deficiencies, raise Trophies to your own Genius ; Thus what I am not my self, I make you, by accident; So increases a black spot the candour of a blanch'd vesture; So gloomy shades seem to augment the Ph aebean radiances, and so are your perfections set off by the foiles of Sir, Your servant , W. D. SIR, already bound to you in an obligation , for requitall of a larger sum of favours, then my poor abilities can any wayes satisfy, yet now you make a large addition to the principall debt by---Till fortune better enable mee, I must beg your acceptance of thankfulnes , which I designe in liew of interest , and ( for your better security ) my Bond renewed for the rest, with the addition of another surety , my Service, seald with the privy signet of my love, attested by two witneses, gratitude and acknowledgment , and subscribed by Sir, Your faithfull servant , T. B. SIR, my letters and addresses both various and uncertain; Hence have proceeded (and a while I fear must) the languishment of my lines, the alternation of my weekes; Yet with this added disadvantage, that the more time may seem given mee to write, the less I have to be accurate. I received your last abroad, and am never yet more at home, then where they find mee, or I them. A virtue that (with mee) accompanies yours, and yours onely; And being it wants a name, let it be a Sympathy: a Sympathy twixt you and mee, so charming, that by reading your characters, I draw in my own Idea's (but abettered) and so fall, by an introversion, into my self. By this you may guess how much you endear your friend; by so expressing your self his, to make him (even in the midst of distractions, and fatigues) his own; and yet only to own him, to be more yours and Gods. Know then, I am yet free from misfortune, nor enfeebled by any mortall malady, that's sensible; Some grudgings of a Caduque being, and the unwholsome seasons effects if I feel, they are but the antecedents of what I am sure at last must follow. But since you stile my sickness, your infirmity; my infortunes, your mishaps. I would be well to encrease your Vigours; fortunate to lessen your least bad evens. The Heavens influence and their interpreting Predictions now we hear begin to work in your clime, and as the operation bodens stupendious revolutions, so are we tickled with curiosity to know your changes, by what steps the main Designes ascend and what you conceive will be the sequels chiefly of neerest connexion. In the mean, we wil, hope and feare; Two passions that will blend all the fore-casts of humane life. Be careful of your health, that you may enjoy your self in a distracted Age. So shall you be safe in the guards of your own virtues; and in the innocency of your life, with comfort consolate your friends, Amongst whom not the least dependene, is ever, Dear Sir, Your intirely affectionate 21 Aril 1653. D. W. SIR, during this absence, was grounded upon a just sence of my obligations, without the left reflection upon my disabilities for any such performance; And in this respect I might justly have been disobliged without breach of faith, but that (seriously) I had rather discover my imperfections in this kind, then be any waies wanting in my remerciaments, which are much indebted to your many favours: And therefore I send this small tribute, as an earnest of the much greater affection of Sir, Your cosen and servant , T. B. Dear Cosen, have met with none equal to that, which the receit of your Letter affords mee; for (trust mee) I am so ravish'd with the contents, that whensoever I perceive that sadnes to invade mee, which the want of your sweet presence often begets, I have instantly recourse to your Letter for cure. Thus do I honour the lines, for your dear sake that sent them, nor shall I ever cease to acknowledge your numberless favours, whilst I have breath but to pronounce mee Dear Cosen, Your most affectionate servant , T. B. SIR, the rudenes and indigestion of mine, and when I consider the pith and plenitude of your lines, I look upon the emptiness and inanity of my own with much indignation: yet, though I were not born a Cicero for Eloquence, I am and must be another Achates for affection. If there bee any thing in this World can deserve the name of good , 'tis really in the fruition of you; in and by whom I am so perfectly beatified, that I count my self in a Paradise, when I am gathering the fruits of your presence. Fortune (in other things less liberal) has given me many friends, and Correspondents, yet none so reall, none so learned, as your self; I never made so happy a bargaine (if I may so rudely stile it) as when I contracted this intertrafique of love; I never hear from you or see you, but I make an infinite purchase of piety, and knowledge, from your weighty lines and solid discourse; But above all, I have gained (yet blush to think with how little desert) in you a friend, whose bosome is an Archive, fit to treasure up the greatest secret, and in whose hands I can repose my life, nay (which is dearer) my Soul; O happiness; happiness said I? 'tis beyond the degree of common happiness; Such pious condescendings (where you give pure Gold and receive nothing but dross in exchange) argue a goodness in you, beyond the reach of my pen to delineate, which I must content my self, to admire. Sir , you have here the reall dictates of my inmost thoughts, though wrapt up in a homely dress; for I am as yet hardly entred into the Suburbs of good Language; yet do but pardon these my rude expressions, and I may hope (by your conduct) in time to enter that City, where you, by due merit, command in chief. To morrow I am bound for the frigid Zone, yet will assure you, that no change of Climate shall have power to alter or frigidify the affections of Sir, Your devoted servant and therein most happy .; T. B. SIR, pathetike your love, that I am both rapt and enflamed: you could never in better time have made your friendly addresses; They came as cordialls to refresh my exhausted Spirits. I was even spent in dispatches, distracted with unexpected visits of friends. From these, as a reviving refrigeration, I cast my eyes and thoughts on your emphatick straines. In which I am lost; Can wonder, but not reply. In short, I am so variously divided this day; and chiefly for the moments of the Messengers stay, that I have not respite of reply. Before you direct your course, toward the North Pole, I hope to get so much pause, as to be my own, that I may make some suppletory addition. Pardon these extemporaries: what in sense and language is deficient, that affection supplies, which really ever stiles mee Sir, Yours , D. W SIR, answer them; I promis'd also to be more responsity, and now repent it. My leasure's as interrupted, and second revisings of your accurate lines disanimate. What is most delightful to view, is as hard to parallell. Sir , the flote of your Eloquence runs high, and where (by the Art of self annihilation,) you would seem to depress your sufficiency, there you most rise; And indeed skil cannot but by skil be hid, nor perspicuous abilities better blazond, then when most curiously mantled by arted invelopings. You are no Cicero born, 'tis confessed, yet I think born to be an English Cicero ; of this, nature has given ripe specimens, and industry as fast polishes, judgement matures. In one letter I trace you florishing in various figures; in the property and store of words choise, in composure compt; in sense acute. Trust mee, I admire, yet cannot envy; For whilst an Achates in affection, your embellishments are mine. The Accessory (you know) in Law follows the Principall , and love makes all common. If then by this inviolable tie we are one, your endowments entitle me joint owner; a riches, I prepone to Monarchies. Sir , I were happy did I rightly own the least degree in the literary attributes you please to give mee; those of endeared passion I doe; those of reality I cannot refuse. It is indispensably your claime; what e're I am or shall be (that's commendable) is dedicated to your loyal friendship; honour me with belief til I faile. My breast (as long as the harbour of a heart) shall be a safe repository; I was never by ingenerate disposition sutile and porous, and with so prudent and embosom'd a friend, I shall not sure begin. Upon secrets I do not wittingly encroach, yet if (by freedom of a friend) committed, the gastly terrours of death unlock them not; He that wants this gift has no challenge to Amities sacred interest. But I am now interturb'd, and my pen (dear friend) is snatch'd off, yet first take these votary wishes; Propitious be your guiding Stars; inspiring the Muses ; a safe journey; fortunate your expeditions, and a speedy circuit to your City entertainments and suspir'd retires; It is almost your peculiar felicity, that, where others are chiefly scattered, you can find or make an improving secess; An evidence as you are studious; so you can be, in all places, the commander of your self and houres. Well! my loves, longings and prayers shall accompany this forcd vagary, and with as much joy welcome you home. Interstices locall may divide bodies and a body; united minds know no separation. Hence wherever I, in my better part, am with you concomitant; and lastingly Oxford 29 Sept. Sir, Yours , D. W SIR, riches of your presence, and enriched by the wealth of your lines. But I have learnt there's nothing permanent in this world, otherwise three weeks absence from the one, and deprivement of the other, would be more afflictive, then words can express; For in earnest you are to me that fire of Prometheus , without which all my actions seem inanimate; detaine but the food of your favours from me, and I am a meer nothing. Though I am now bound (as you know) for the North , yet believe it my daily best thoughts shall steer West -ward, where (how far soever distant in person) I leave the hearty affections of Sir, Your faithfull servant , T. B. SIR, fountain of Eloquence be drawn dry, when will your Magazin of rich matter be emptied? never; I now plainly see the more you write, the more you have to write, and may (with reverence) not ineptly compare your Cranium to the holy Chrismatory of France ; you still take out, yet leave it without the least diminution; Prodigy of nature! It fares much otherwise with mee; I (if at any time big with words) fall into a painfull labour, and after many throwes, am alwaies by abortion diliverd of a thing like a bears whelp, which I can lick into no form. Every Bucket drawn from mine own Well, goes neerer the bottome; the reason is, there's no springs for repletion of that store: yet in earnest the influence of your teeming Muse has (me thinks) in some measure fertilis'd my siccaneous and Barren soyle. But whither rove I? Now for News (which is the primum quarite of these dayes) I must tell you, thus---Sir, the length of my letter and this shortest of daies doe not well quadre; This is the winter Solstice. So is it also the Station both of my invention and paper; the first is at a non plus ultra of matter, the last only affords me roome to subscribe my self Sir, 13 December, 1652. Your vowed servant , T. B. Dear brother, small contentment, since I perceive you interesse your self (as a very kind friend) in all things that concern my good, which as I can never forget, so do I ever account my self most happy, when I hear of your progresse in all perfections and good qualities, wherewith to see you accomplished is the passionate desire of Your most affectionate brother , T. B. SIR, the D: If I live not to be able to strike Taleys with you, yet I shill alwaies record your kindnes with a thankfull reminiscence: And though I am blunt in my expression, yet believe it, I shall most willingly in- Gage in any service that may approve mee Sir, Your faithfull servant , T. B. SIR, thence, yet) I fear the matter of this may come from thence too, being not as yet sufficiently rudimented , in your Academy for such susceptions. I must tell you (with some regret) that I find not an Academick (except the noble Britan) in all our voisinage; so that if we converse at all, it must be with Labradors , and such out of whose hebetudinous cerebrosity, we may as soon extract Aurum potabile , as the Elixar of any knowledge; Their querulous outcry is, that the continuall siccity of this season, has inusted all their herbiferous grounds, which may happily breed a dearth of Aliment, as there is already of literature in these parts. Thus much ex obliquo ; now to the purpose; I hope your late obstreperous Alarmes, have not interturb'd the procedure of our noble Authors Miscellany , which is a principall point in my Card. Sir , beleeve it, without some Missive of Consolation from you, the Country will soon put me into a Chagrin , therefore be no longer costive, as you love 10 Aug. Your servant , T. B. SIR, your facetious letter (of 10 August ) with a joculatory line or two; And first by way of allauding your acuminous Exordium ; but withall of shewing, you imediately mistake the word susception , if you think it can stand in a sober sence for understanding , however in a way of Raillery it may pass. Again, rudimented for taught is harsh; so is hebetudinous cerebrosity. Documented for taught may pass in a serious Line; and plumbious , better then hebetudinous ; for, inusted , you should say exusted ; so for herbiferous frugiferous , because herbes and plants are the less principall children of the Earth; whereas Corn and all sorts of grain are the most principall for Mans use; for so you must mean by the word ( aliment ) that followes in the text of your letter. And by this you see there is a kind of Elegance to be observed in a fustian phrase; nay I say more, the lepid lines of fustian are lost, when 'tis not genuine, but strained; And trust me ( Sir ) I hold it a piece of greater Art to line a letter with proper fustian, then with silken language, especially when friends resolve to be merry by distantiall salutes; your French Chagrin and Spanish Labrador may pass as apposite, because proper to the sense, and nothing strained; So the missive of Consolation you desire, by way of an amicable observation upon the Text of yours; And this is what I can sport away, who must rest 17 Aug. Sir, Your fustianizing friend , G. G. SIR, though mine of the 10 of August were but panis speusticus , a doughbak'd piece of fustian, wherein I intended nothing adamussim , yet you must give me leave to make some defence. For Susception I have Rider for my warrant in that sense; Rudimented I hold to be good; and (according to the new mode of converting Nounes into Verbs) I purposely avoided plumbeous cerebrosity (not plumbious as you write it) as trite and thread bare; But for your exception to herbiferous , in that you mistake the sense, for the season hath bin of late very good for Corn and grain, which frugiferous includes, and as bad for grass, the Sun having in some places not only burnt the very roots of it, but has also made strange clefts and impressions in the Earth, therefore I us'd inusted , a word which though not so usual, as exusted , or adusted ; yet in this sense I think no less proper, if not in a genuine, at least in a metaphoricall way, and Cattle, that are fed by grass and hay, are a considerable part of our aliment ,  &c. Sed me reprimo , not at all presuming to enter the Cirque with you in Logomachy or the pugnacity of such disputes, but with submission in all things to your greater judgement, whence I must confess to have received in these my junior years, a great increment to my smaller portion of knowledge both by these and other your documentall redargutions, which I alwaies receive with a reverential respect, answerable to your merit and the obligation of Sir, 24 Aug: Your very humble servant , T. B. SIR, last; For tis a signe you are Master of what you do, when you can avow it ab ipsis primis principlis , and thereby shew you are as far from being conscious of errour, as you are from being inscious how far you may use the latitude of fustianising, without exceeding the limits of modest avowment, per modum inculpata tuteloe. Macte animo mi Thoma, & perge eo quo cepisti pede, &c. Trust me Sir , I shall (without a blush) easily yeeld you the advantage of me in legomachy , as of enrimes deep Divines do to Logicians in point of reducing Syllogismes to all their possible variations into severall Moodes and figures ; because the one is actually conversant in that particular, whereas the other depends only upon the habitual use of such figures, without retaining the rule that leads to the rectitude thereof; So men Speak true Latine, without being able to give rule for it, and by this means sometimes are peccant against the Rule, which every school-boy can correct them in. And truely in this particular of Logomachy you may and will be able to read Lectures to the deepest of men, because you laudably make it your profess'd study, and consequently will make a world of men obliged to you, as well as Sir, Your servant , G. G. SIR, visits, am gratefull, yet cannot returne the curtesie, but by feeble thanks; In this nature I have now been 3 weeks a decumbent; This the cause I have already faild in my wonted entercourse; and the same continuate disability must render these, of my own complexion, infirm and faint, yet I beg you will not interrupt your turnes; For though I am not responsible, yet your lines are much solace, and no smal divertisement from the sence of my weaknes: What was before but a friendly correspondence, will (till it please God I mend) be an office of endearing charity, extended towards him, who is Sir, Entirely yours W. D. My dearest friend, much the sadder, by how much I was farther distanced from your sweet abode, nor had the sadnes of this forc'd vagary any solace at all, saving that of neer 300 miles, I passed no one, without making a Relique of your memory, which had still the vertue to renew all joyes in me, and expell the mists of melancholy, almost with equall force (so strong was my imagination) as if I had been really in your presence; If you have but bestowed one thought on me for every hundred I have dedicated to you, I am satisfied, beleeving that no love can come within so many degrees of mine, nor that there's any state so happy, as that of being Your devoted servant , T. B. My onely dear, you these, and if I seem importune by my frequent addresses, you must pardon me, since I profess to receive no solace in this absence, but what the comfortable entertainment of thoughts on you affords me, and should I but as often put such thoughts in writing, as my heart presents them to my memory, I should be no day, even no hour without a pen in my hand; And I may well hope, from the excellency of your nature, that you will not leave such faith, such affection, without a just retribution, nor can I despair of your remembrance of me in some proportion answerable to mine of you; so may happiness in the end crown both, and I live eternally Yours, as at first, unalterable , T. B. SIR, which imports, though not our immunity, yet riddance:  & to have overcome annoiance may be better, then not to have suffered it. This since you say, you have bin almost dead of a Cold, congratulates your almost Resurrection: and hopes to find your shortwindednes turn'd into free respiration. 'Tis a vulgar Probleme, whether this malady may be called a disease, or Physick. You I believe, found it troublesome; but will not repent, if it prove medicinall. I imagine (allur'd by Aprils forward Sun) you slipt too early into your Summer Aparell; which, though it prov'd too thin to defend you, yet not unable, to make you take a warier choise of your Wardrobe next Spring. Gondamor was of opinion, as there were in England many seasons of the year in one day; so a man had need of severall suits: My fancy is, if you will not alwaies be shifting, 'tis best not to shift till you see nature in her best Green gown: whose fashion you may harmlesly follow. Sir, you see by my spinning out this one Clause of your letter, I want matter; Yet you may see too, there's nothing drops so raw from you, but affords subiect. Nor must you blame me, if your indisposition busie my Pen, since your [illeg.]![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  is the Copie of it, and my own best constitution. Hence you have a double care lies upon your preservation; your love to your self, and indulgence to Sir, Your servant , W. D. SIR, now (were not our mutuall loves united with many a dear link) jealousie (that Canker of affection) would corrode my heart. I should, (and can yet hardly forbear to) judge, that you had some more deserving object in your mind, when you fancied mee with such high commends, as hold no proportion with my merit. I know you never wrote, but your heart and Pen were coitinerants, yet (pardon mee, if) I assure you that in this (and perhaps in this alone) love has purblinded your (otherwise much discerning) judgment; should I believe all you write of me, I might quickly be wasted into a Fools Paradise, and so become a Ludibry ; I'le rather characterise my self, then own the least of your attributes; take it thus bluntly, yet with truth and candor: for I have studied that Sentence which was engraven upon the gate of Apollo's Temple at Delphos (viz) [illeg.]![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  I was born under the dull planet Saturn, so that Mercury had no influence on my production, hence I am so far from being a Lynceus of nature, a Pelops of wisdome, or Cicero of Eloquence, that I never pretended to any of those vertues, which beget admiration, nor to have my mind embroidered with any studied ornaments of learning, I onely claime some small title to those qualities, which stir affection. As truth of word, sincerity of heart ,  &c. Having thus ingenuously premised, I now send you an inhibition from the Court of love, not to treat any more of that subject, but to redargue my Errors and shew me the flats both of my pen and judgement, that what I write hereafter may merit this only Elogium; As here's no Eloquence, so likewise no incongruity or affectation ; I aim no higher; for in earnest if it were possible any thing of yours could nauseate me, the way were to send me a Laudatory Epistle, instead of a redargutory letter; But I have another task, therefore tis high time to put Omega to this, by subscribing my self Sir, Your humblest servant , T. B. SIR, see, your Arts Master: and what you could not divert, by a just disclaim; you can stop, by an exaggerated retorsion . You may expect, I should now imitate your shime-fac'd modestie; right this paper, with renouncing the abilities you heap upon me. But, I will not; should I, We should still dwell in one Theme, and by the Nauseous tautologie, both impaire, what ere we both merit. I dare not vendicate to my self, a perfect selfe- knowledge ; nay, I avoid the reflex glances, that should tell me what I am; lest what I am, might cast me into a dejection; and so, hinder amendment. Pusillanimity, never yet attained an eminence. Do you cease your own vndervaluings, and I shall my more adjusted expressions. I can let your worths , be their own blazons, would you so let them; but, if you will wrong your self, justice calls me, to your vindication. Nor, must the Legists Maxime, here sway; volenti non fit injuria . Neither of us (pardon the parallel) are so accomplisht but we ought to thrive in imbelishments. Whether our Souls came Aristotles Tabula rasa ; or written with Plato's Idea's into our earth; in our earth, they have either forgot much, or learnt little. The fault, doubtles, ours. For, by what we know, we know we might, and may, know more. Nature hath made us capable; that we become not better Proficients, our own truant inertie, the obstacle. I am not so much a Scot, as to confess a substantiall difference, in souls: nor yet, such an Abcedary Philosopher, as to deny the Organs must be fitted, where the operation is to be excellent. You, and I should be ingrate, did we not assert, God has been liberall enough. To asperse his bounty with our wants, were a petty blasphemie in Philosophie it self. Let us both confess our respective ignorance, and our ignorance to be onely ours . This done: we are not to center in old dulness, but from the remorse of lost time, vigorously imploy the future. It imports the Vulgar [illeg.]our, more to be good, than sagacious: We, are moulded for higher action, yet must joyn Vertue to knowledge. Reason's brutish, where the will's incult. The Patterne we were effigiated to, was infinitely Knowing , infinitely good; in both, we are bound to imitate: bound to be the Representatives of both, or, we forfeit our Orginall, and our similitude, too. Man's a little world; his minde the Heaven; the two great Lights those splendid faculties, his Intellect, and Will: the lesser Starres, are the other powers: the intellect the Sun of all: all borrow his brightnesse, all must Coopeate with his raies, by adding their proper vertues. Thus shall our Micro- cosme be resplendent and fruitful, and gloriously rich; thus, we wise, and good, and thus nor good nor wise, I am Sir, Yours , D. W. SIR, elogicall commends, which whilst you seem to intend in this, you have by a Rhetoricall Artifice, added more fewell to that fire; So that I perceive whether I write or be silent, complain or acquiesce, I am every way dilemma'd; I must confess to have nor wit nor language enough, to fadome the depth of your abilities, and by consequence am rendred impossibilited to pay you in your own coine, which is of such allay, that I may well say, you have truely found out the Philosophers stone , since you are able to convert any gross matter into the gold of fine language; your prosaick lines are (for excellency) like those metricall ones of Homer , which as they excell in other points, so they seem to have an easie native slide in them, and to be conducted by a happy Genius . If I had abilities to expatiate upon this subject, I could not be held a Patelin , but rather a suffragran to truth; what I want words to express, silent admiration shall speak in the thoughts of Sir, Your obliged servant , T. B. SIR, otherwise I should in this intercouse have one (and one onely) advantage of you; For whilst you at every return of the Tabellary, have your Theme to seek, and yet no sooner sought but found (such is the magazin of your invention) I have a plentifull subject alwaies ready at hand, if I had answerable abilities to make my election, and word it accordingly, and that is news , news which whilst there are men, will never cease to bee in vogue; And since this week affords that which is somewhat palaticall, I shall no longer tantalize you with a proletarious Exordium . Then know,  &c. \---I shal on all occasions endeavor to serve you, having bin cordially, ever since I told you so, Sir Your faithfull servant . T. B. SIR, where others erect their engines, to ruine, your levell aimes to strengthen the weak Fort you direct against; your continued Elogies at last mean to perswade me (I see) into some Ablity, and could you infuse what you commend (instead of blush) your Rhetorique would make me doubtless eloquent I will not say with that keen Satyrist recuso Euge tuum & Belle . No I will with a modest guilt of non-desert embrace them, to profit, and that necte qu aesiveris extra (of the same Poet) was a good Monition, but our Muse is not so stoicall. Quic enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam, Pr aemia si tollas ?---Sir, honours the reward of Arts and fame the tongue of honour, nor are either honour or fame more the guerdons, then the incentives of Proficience. Do you see (my friend) how I hug your attributions? My vanity yet (in it) may be your lesson; not to be vain but ingenuous. Be not so squeamish, hence forward: Accept your Baies offered, or merit it confer'd. What praise finds not answerable, let it incite to answer. I know my insufficiencies, but utterly despair not amendment; If by your encouragement I amend not, I shall confesse my Brutish nature, to be past cure. If I grant you an advantage over me, 'tis but what you have asserted: I answer the same Post, and to many besides yours; But what is this? my both matter, and the couching shewes it, to be suddainly slight and rude, an odd perfection, and but suitable to both my leisure and me; you have a ready subject for your pen, and how gratefully and ably you paint it forth, give me leave to be the Judge, that receive the delight: and I must keep it to my self, for you are as coy to receive the titles of your worth, as I am conscious they are due. Be then stil higher then words can express you; so I may still bee Sir, Excessively yours , W. D. Most honoured Lady, have most will, I find least power to unbosome the secrets of my heart, such force has love to captivate my faculties. Hence tis I rather chose this, then that other way of verball delivery; For though in either I should discover my own imperfections, yet in these lines my guiltles blushes will pass unseen. Hitherto I have onely appear'd a servant to your affaires, and in that quality had continued if the excellency of your personall endowments had not (by some kind of heavenly impulse) driven mee on to more aspiring thoughts; Thoughts, which (with truth I speak it) were engendred by the onely object of your goodnes, without any adulterate commixture of estate, which (however valued by others) is not of weight sufficient to turn the ballance of my scale, if not otherwise well laden with pure and unbias'd affection, which I profess to owe to none but you; and to you all things, even the being of Your most faithfull and devoted servant , T. B. My inestimable Jewell, had not been qualified with the sweet odors of your own cordialls, I had (unfeignedly speaking) wholly sacrifiz'd the ensuing night to the vigils of a disquiet mind; But as your goodnesse had not the will onely, but the power to raise mee from a hell of tormenting thoughts, to a Paradise of expected comfort, so does it multiply my endeared affections, which no misfortune shall have power to alienate, nor shall any thing but death determine: I am with much sollicitude letting all my imaginations upon the tenter, in order to the removall of those Rocks, which seem (and but seem) to threaten Shipwrack to our approaching happiness, whereto your utmost contribution is (by all the ties of true love) most earnestly implored, together with the continuance of him in your best thoughts, who is Your own beyond expresses , T. B. Among all the obloquies, which the unrelenting malice of mine ( and by consequence your ) enemies hath cast upon mee, none appears so gastly in my thoughts, as that pretended want of love towards you, which (the heavens will witness) was never imbreasted in any mortall with more purity and plenitude; For 'tis the foundation, whereon I intend (by divine assistance) to build a frame of mutuall and interminable happines; a happines that will be admited by some, but envied by others. Please to remember that you are now filia emancipata ( as Divines terme you ) at your own dispose, and that you have of mee a servant, who only breathes by your favour and lives through your love, who will ever owe you fealty for the one, and still do you homage for the other; a servant, who with unwearied expectation only waits for the happy houre, wherein that ( fiat ) shall be by you pronounc'd, which will in an instant ( Elixar -like) turn all my drossy cares and anxieties into true contentments, and make me live eternally Yours without change , T. B. My happy Choice, foulnesse of the weather but an easie penance, in respect of the solace, which the sweets of your presence would have afforded me; for the enjoyment whereof I must (with much regret) adjourn my expectation till to morrow; Mean time I send you the promised pictures, if the sight of which do at any time erect your thoughts to heaven-ward; even then remember him, who on earth desires no greater happines, then to live and die loving (and beloved by) you, in quality of Your second self , T. B. Madam, excusing a fault, yet the Eminency of your Ladyships person doth so aggravate it in me, that I must beg leave to lessen, though, I cannot hope to have it wholly remitted, in saying the justness of your Ladyships cause of stay, made me presume none had so little compassion as to deny it; and that I might expect the being freed from my ague, without danger of losing the opportunity of presenting my humble thanks for so many signal favours, undeservedly conferred on me; but since that happiness with many others is lost by your Ladyships absence, honour this paper so far I beseech you, as to suffer it to supply my defects herein, and testify how ambitious I shall be, by my future observance, to merit the title of Madam, Your most humble servant , A. B. SIR, Lady to her grave ; A Corporall work of Mercy, it is to bury the Dead, I grant; but to interr so great a Beauty seems to entrench on Pity and blast the Spring. Had she lived til Autumn or even Midsommer, the funeralls of many flowers had lamented her Urne: yea if but till they had been blown, they would have lost their lives to adorn her Hearse; and have been ambitious (like those Savages) to have been buried quick with their Ladie Paragon, for her attendance in the other World. But she has inverted Nature, and the Season too; the flower of beauty died, when the beauty of flowers should spring; and so has not onely left a withered World, but dismayed the Blowth of what should garnish it. Flowers are disheartened to open their fragrant Colors, since their Pattern is so early Cropt: and seem to intend (being she's entomb'd under the Earths surface) to keep themselves under Earth to accompany her dust; yet I will free you of cruelty in this fate; you had no hand ( I am sure ) in her death, though you helpt her to her Grave. And who should be a fitter Mourner at the exequies of a fair Lady, than so compleat a servant of Ladies? Sir , I see what grace you are entertained with by them: they not only love you living, but are loath to part with you, dead: will carry you as far as they can towards the other life, when they goe. That if they may not have your company quite through (which were a wrong to Survivors) they may your funerall tears, sighes, or prayers for their Ultime Vale : you preface a happy imprimis , to this sad discourse, and say having (first) done all that might tend to her future happiness , Happy News! and it ownes you, I believe, an instrument of good effects and offices. Had all fair Ladies such faithfull servants, More Idols of beauty would receive impression of the divine Image, and become the servants of God. And she had much reason to desire your care of her bodies enterrment, that had first aided her Soul, with a saving Viaticum for heaven. Long may you live the Author or helper of such good deeds. In the interim, as here was a double work of mercy ( Corporal and Spiritual ) exploited; so you, I am confident, have made your useful application of the Accident; beheld in the blasting of this flower, the fate of Fairness, the frailties of the fairest Clay, that feature, and white and red could embelish. If she were not Superlative in Beauty, in beauty she had many inferiours; if in fortunes, not the favourite of fortune; yet, she had her smiles. Many Beauties have faln sooner, many may sooner fade; yet in her all beauties, all fortunes, have expest, what fortunes and beauties are; what is the Exit of the Fable of this temporary life; to wit, ugly death, eternal deprivation, the cold Tomb, and deformed dust. Fortunate life! that so contemplates mortal condition, as to be indifferent and ready to change; that fraile incertainties and vain glitter may be motives to assure and fix on lasting good, that by others death learns to live, and lives the life that fears not death: that so accompanies others funeralls, as in that sable equipage, to behold the mournful Pomp of the Worlds fare-wel, and their own destiny: that reads in that earthy bed of death (the Grave of others) their own Motto, we are dust, and all mortall things Momentary. Sir , pardon this long slip of my pen, you see how a fair Ladies death and your living pietie, entrances me, to the forgetfulness of other subjects. Thanks for your News on which, the only present comment shall be; that I am for ever Sir, Your thankfull servant , D. W. SIR, excellent a comment upon our late sunerous text, I cannot think the particulars of that sad subject (how confusedly soever I deliver them) will be unacceptable to you; This Lady was three moneths continually dying, without any hope of recovery, and this occasioned by an ulcer in her throat, it was my good fortune (though others had essai'd it) to gain her first assent to bring a spirituall Physitian to her. Dr. G. was next at hand and did act his part exceedingly well; after 2 or 3 effective visits, the Patient (through the comfort and ease of the spirituall Cataplasmes and emplaisters, which the Doctor applied) was so rapt and piously enamor'd of him, as she even embrac'd him at every appearance. When she drew neer the confines of deaths kingdom, she did usually ejaculate not only most pious, but even eloquent or rather diviniloquent expressions, as this (among many others) which heaven grant I may never forget. I have (said she) lived long in the vanity of this World, for which God hath placed mee in this bed of sorrow; Were it his holy pleasure, I should act over one of them again, and the choice left to mee, I would (by the Grace of Jesus) rather choose the torments of this bed, and malady, then have any thing to do with the Worlds vanities, &c. Besides nothing did so much trouble her, as that she had lived (as she said) for fear of Worldly endamagment) some yeares in an outward profession that contradicted her inward perswasion . The Doctor was no less taken with his Patient, then she with him, for I heard him say he was never more satisfied with the manner of any persons death; And I confess her exit did more infuriate me, then did that of my own Sister, the manner of it, not a little both mortifying and edifying mee; For to see her picture in the Anti-chamber, and then go in and look upon the original, was subject enough for mortification, the one being so incomparably beautifull, the other so ghastly; In a word, the last breath she drew was Je \- and in pronouncing sus she expir'd. So that we may conclude, as she was a great beauty living, she was a greater dead; For whereas corporal beauty in others dies with the body, hers did not so, but by a secret transition pass'd into the Soul. Thus have you heard the brief (but sad) story of this good Ladies end, and that from Sir, Your humble servant , T. B. SIR, one, compar'd to this you impose on your self, and yet you will only here play the Stoick, in not acknowledging you are in pain; Nothing can justify me, but obedience, for presuming to offer this tedious Romance to those eyes that should onely look upon Iliads ; I give verses as Galenists do Physick, which clogs the stomack more then the disease; I must confess we may view Cities taken, kingdomes ruin'd and new worlds discoverd in lesse roome; It is a Poem that hath neither height not profundity, yet it has length; it overflowes but swells not; it wearies without ascents, as Promenades do upon a flat; In a word, I shall think, if you do not find fault with it and reprehend me, it is because you are angry and will do nothing in Passion; however 'tis a trust I recommend to your secrecy, for follies are not things of the least consequence to trust a friend with. And having now performed my promise with you, I expect you should do the like with Sir, Your affectionate servant , J. C. SIR, Spheres , so their change; And 'tis just, they should submit to therein essentiall Guides. Among other novelties, the first mover has brought about the point of Circular motion , that has begun us a New year; and promises many unwonted effects. Whilst these appeare, let us be the same we were, constant old friends to God, heaven and our selves. Change, though to the better, argues imperfection; yet not to change to the better, were the worst of imperfections. As restless rivers hast to their Ocean, so ought we to ours, which is God, that Ocean of bliss, repose, and Center of Eternity; Till here arrived, we are in flux and variety: Let us be so, but hold the right way. As Grace is elder then Nature , so she first begins her year; Astronomers commence theirs with the springs vigour, when the Sun's in Aries , the Church is content with Capricorn ; When her Sun's in the Cradle, that Orient of Justice and mercy, the Son of God, The signes melancholy; yet the forerunner of more propitious. So let our sorrows shorten with the nights, our joyes with the dayes, lengthen. This solstice (if we follow the conduct of the right Star) will fairly move to a brighter height, a nearer approach; dispell our mists, warm our hearts, ravish our eyes. This rambling prologue, is but to bring in the prayer that wishes you a happy New year, and that regard of times winged Cariers, which in running moments may take hold of the stedfast point of eternity. This is the Center of circumference; in which who truely fix, may be moved, but not from it. Then, as time whirls away the measure of our mortal being, it will hasten that, which shall know no alteration, but to be invariable. Sir , my complexion suits the dead season at present, and yeilds me but a languishing health: Hence my Pen's as dull. You know when the bodie's out of order, the spirits cannot but flag. I must suffer the one, you will pardon the other. And so to affaires that require no politure, but what your patience shall give them,  &c. 2 January. W. D. SIR, more I have a mind to read it, such are the incentives of your heaven inspired lines, which as they clearly demonstrate the truth of that Maxime of a modern Author, that Eternity is the Port and Sabbath of all humane Contemplations : So, since my more earthy Soul and lesse heavenly cogitations are not able in due manner to comprehend them; I wrap my self in this your learned sheet and say to it (with equal wonder) As Aristotle once did to Euripus, Quta ego non capiote, tu capias me T. B. SIR, welwishes of my heart, conceiving you as close in the pursuit of your fair Daphne , as Phabus was of his, when the breath of his mouth disorder'd her dissheiveld hair: For I perceive you have now ran so, as happily to take the Virgin-prize; may you be ever mutually happy. There now onely remains the metamorphosis ( not into the Beast with two backs, which the knavish Shakespear speaks of ) but of that more ingenious, two into one, unus, una , into unum , which you have hinted so modestly in yours. Your Daphne I hope (before the arrivall of this paper) will be converted not onely into Bayes , but Rosemary, which is one fragrancy, due to her perfections (if you have (as I doubt not) given her a true Character) more then the Poet gave Apollo's Mistress. Let this therefore suffice to give you both the parabien of Hymen's honours  & felicities, & to let you know I shall expect both and be ambitious to wear a sprig in honour of her, not will I faile heartily to commend you both to the great President of the wedding of Cana in Galilee , that he may turn the bitter Waters of your long expectation into the Wine of a happy and contented life, made up with the blessing of a good and pious posterity; In which devotion I affectionately rest. Sir, Your humble servant , H. T. Madam, Interests; what I may be guilty of by my silence, I know not, but am sure the poor man that asks not the price of a rich Jewell, commits no error. The high estimate I set on your goodness shall be my retreat, in which I shall be safe, if you be what I deem you, good. More I cannot deliver, but that I had rather in an humble silence wait upon some occasion of service, then word out my dull expressions, among which there's none more faithfull, then that I am. (Madam) Your most respective humble Servant , T. B. SIR, contristated; but afterwards considering, that as well Sickness, as all other afflictions come from God, and assuring my self he has sent you this for your great good, I took comfort, and wish you may doe the like; since 'tis a sign of his great love towards you; for He sayes, Quos ego amo, argus & castigo . God deals with men, as Physitians doe with Patients, who easily grant to the sick person, of whose health they despair, all he desires, but whom they hope to recover, they charge to observe a Diet, and abstain from those things that are obnoxious to health. So think God deals now with you, hereby to purge you from sin, and restore your Soul to perfect health. Hence 'twas the Angel Raphael said to Tobias, Quia acceptus eras Deo, necesse fuit ut tentatio probaret te . And as God will have all his true Servants to bee tryed in the Furnace of Tribulation, like pure Gold in that of fire, so is he never more neer to them, then in their Affliction, Himself having said, Cum ipso sum in tribulatione ; From which you may raise a great comfort to your self, suffering (as I hope you doe) with patience and resignation; for Tribulation is so notable a sign of Gods mercy and presence, That Saint Bernard desired of God hee might never be without it, saying, Da mihi, Domine Tribulationem, ut semper mocum fis . And St Augustine likewise, Hic ure me, hic seca me, ut parcas in aternum . Therefore bee of good courage, and believe, That God by this Visitation, knocks at the dore of your Soul, and wils you to prepare your self for him. Bee truly constant in your holy Faith, what tentation soever you meet with to the contrary; Repose your onely hope and trust in Christs Death and Passion; let your Charity be such as to forgive all persons that have injur'd you, even from the bottom of your heart, as you desire the forgiveness of Almighty God, to whose holy will and pleasure resign your self wholly, offering him freely life, pains and death, and whatever appertains to you, to dispose according to his blessed will. I perswade my self you have ere this orderly disposed your worldly affairs; Then make it now your only care to provide for the good of your Soul (as business of greatest import) humbly beseeching the mercy of God, and frequenting the holy Sacram. And then, by his Grace, whensoever it shall please him to call you hence, you may joyfully say with holy Simeon, Nunc dimittis servum tuum Domine, secundum verbum tuum in pace . The best service I can now doe you, is to offer my poor prayers to our blessed Saviour for you, which shall be daily performed by (Sir) Your most affectionate servant , B. G. SIR, addresse these, to assure you, That as the advise I gave you, proceeded meerly from the affection of a Brother, and was not without a reasonable ground; so I may not doubt but it was candidly received, and that the whole matter and circumstances are buryed in perpetuall oblivion. Beleeve it, though my nature be averse to Complements, yet my best Love is much affixed on your dear Self; which I shall be as ready to testifie upon any reall occasion, as I am now to write my self, ( Dear Brother ) Your affectionate servant . T. B. according to the usage of the present times. If to a Duke; Excellent or illustrious Prince. And in discourse we stile him Grace. If to a Marquess, To the right Noble or Right honourable. And in discourse his attribute is, Lordship or Honour. If to an Earle, Viscount or Baron To the right honourable. And to begin a Letter, we, either say, May it please your Honor or Lordship! Right honorable! My Lord! Which last is used only by Lords to Lords, or by Gentlemen of some quality, otherwise it is held too familiar. If to a Baronet, or Knight of the Bath, we say To the honourable or much honoured. And his attribute ( in the beginning of a Letter ) may be Much honored Sir. The like may be given to a Collonel. The usuall attribute of a Knight was of old Right Worshipful. And of an Esquire Worshipful. But these are much disus'd, unles it be by persons of inferiour rank. We say (writing to a Knight) To my noble or to my much honored friend, Sir A. B. Knight, these present. To an Esquire we say To my much honored or most worthy friend T. G. Esquire. Observe that (when you write to an Esq;) You be sure not to say Master T. G. Esq; for the (Master) is ridiculous, the Esq including it. So if you write to a Doctor of Divinity, a Doctor of the Civil Law, or Doctor of Physick, you must not say Mr. Doctor T. G. nor Doctor T. G. Esq ; for Doctor both comprehends Master and Esquire, and of these the Divine hath first place, the Civilian next, and the Physitian last. To an ordinary Gentleman thus, To my approved friend To my most esteemed friend To my much valued friend To my very much respected friend To my worthy good friend , or the like. Note that all the younger Sons of Dukes and Marquesses are Lords for their lives only, and are called Lord John , or Lord William ,  &c, by their Christian names. The eldest Son of an Earle is a Lord by birth, so is not a Viscounts Son, till his Father be dead. The youngest Sons of Viscounts and Barons are but Esquires, yet are honorable, and take place of all Baronets and Knights. The eldest Son of a Baron is but an Esq; during his Fathers life. Esquire (comes from the French Escuier , in latin Armiger or Scutifer. i. a bearer of Armes , or of a Sheild , and) is that Degree of Gentry, which is next to a Knight; It is conceived at first these Esquires were bearers of Arms to Lords and Knights, and thereby had their name and dignity: Now, to be true Esquires according to the Law of Armes, they must either be Lords younger Sons, Baronets or Knights eldest Sons, members of Parlement, Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, Serjeants or Barristers at Law (yet the late Earle Marshall would not allow Barristers to be Elquires , but in the Act for Polemoney they were ranked by the then Parliament as Esquires and paid as such) or of some ancient family that has it by being heir to a Knight in the right line; yet now a days (I know not by what warrant) all Gentlemen that have but some considerable Estate in Lands, take that title upon them, when as the Estate (though never so great) adds no title. And that the title of Esq ; should descend from Father to Son (as the Estate of Gentry doth) is meer fabulous, says Mr. Hern in his Glory of Generosity , p. 100. Ladies have (for the most part) the same attributes as their husbands. Both in Letter and discourse, we give a Dutches the title Grace. But to a Marchioness, Countess, Viscountess or Baroness, Right honorable , and in discourse your Honor and among their equals, or in more familiar discourse, Madam. If you write to any of these, the title Madam , is very moding, both at the beginning and end of your Letter. But if the person writing be of much lower Rank, then the Lady written unto, it will be decent to say, May it please your honour, or Right honourable! All the daughters of Dukes , Marquesses and Earles are Ladies by birth, and are called Lady Anne , Lady Mary ,  &c. But the daughters of a Viscount or Baron are but Mistris , yet are honorable; And their Addition (being named in instruments of Law or Conveyances) is no more then a Yeomans daughter hath, and that is Spinster , wherein there seems to be some title wanting. transcribe an abstract of two Decrees made by King James touching the same, in the 10 and 14 years of his raigne, which you may read more at large in Mr. Seldens Titles of honour, Page 906. precedence before all Baronets. That such Bannerets ( as shall be made by the Kings Majesty, his heirs and Successors, or by Henry now Prince of Wales, under his or their Standard displayed in an Army Royall in open war, and the King or Prince personally present) for their lives onely, and no longer shall for ever in all places take place and precedence, as well before all other Bannerets whatsoever, as likewise before the younger Sons of Viscounts and Barons, and before all Baronets. The younger Sons of Viscounts and Barons, and all Baronets shall take place before all Bannerets whatsoever other then such as shall be made by the King as aforesaid. That the Knights of the Garter, Privy Counsellors to the King, the Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries, the Chancellor and under-Treasurer of the Exchequer, Chancellor of the Dutchy, the chief Justice of the Kings Bench, the Master of the Rolls, the Chief Justice of the Common pleas, the chief Baron of the Exchequer and all other the Judges and Barons of the degree of the Coif of the said Courts, shall have place before the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons, and before all Baronets. That Baronets and their heires Males shall alwayes have place next unto the younger Sons of Viscounts and Barons, and their wives shall take place accordingly. husbands lives, as after; And the daughters of the same Baronets following next after the said wives of the eldest sons of Baronets, shall have place and precedence before the eldest son and the wife of the eldest son of any Knight of what Order soever; And likewise the younger sons of such Baronets and their wives shall take place accordingly before the younger Sons of any Knights , &c. FINIS.
