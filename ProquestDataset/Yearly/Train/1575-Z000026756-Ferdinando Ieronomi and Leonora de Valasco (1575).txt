 For if I shoulde novve at this age seeme as carelesse of reproche, as I vvas in greene youth readie to goe astray, my faultes might quickely grovve double, and myne estimation shoulde bee vvoorthie too remayne but single. I haue learned that although there may bee founde in a Gentleman vvhereby to be reprehended or rebuked, yet ought he not to be vvoorthie of reproofe or condemnation. All this I set dovvne in preamble, too the ende I maye thereby purchase youre pacience. And as I desyre that you vvyll not condemne mee vvythoute proofe, so am I contented, that if heereafter you finde mee guiltie, youre definitiue sentence shall then passe publikelye vnder the Seale of Seueritie. It vvere not reason (righte reuerende) that I shoulde bee ignoraunt hovve generally vvee are all magis proni ad malum qu am ad bonum. Euen so is it requisite that I acknovvledge a generall reformation of maners more necessarie to bee taught, than anye VVhetstone of Vanities is meete (in these dayes) to bee suffered. And therefore as youre grauitie hathe thought requysite that all ydle Bookes or vvanton Pamphlettes shoulde bee forbidden, so might it seeme that I vvere vvoorthie of greate reprehension, if I shoulde bee the Aucthour of euill vvilfully, or a prouoker of vyces vvittingly. And yet some there are vvho haue not spared too reporte that I receyued greate summes of money for the first printing of these Posies, vvhereby (if it vvere true) I mighte seeme not onely a craftie Broker for the vtteraunce of garishe toyes, but a corrupte Merchaunte for the sale of deceyptfull vvares. For ansvvere heereof it is moste true (and I call Heauen and Earth too vvitnesse) that I neuer receyued of the Printer, or of anye other, one grote or pennie for the firste Copyes of these Posyes. True it is that I vvas not vnvvillinge the same shoulde bee imprinted: And that not of a vaineglorious desyre too bee thought a pleasaunt Poet, neyther yet of a lyghte minde too bee counted a cunning Louer. For though in youth I vvas often ouerhardie too put my name in Ballaunce of doubtfull iudgementes, yet novve I am become so bashfull that I coulde rather bee content too leese the prayse of my follyes, than too hazarde the misconceyte of the graue and graye headed Iudges. But too confesse a truthe vntoo you right reuerende (vvith vvhome I maye not dissemble in cases vvhiche so generally doe touche all menne) I vvas the rather contented too see them imprinted for these sundrie considerations. First, for that I haue seene dyuerse Authours, (both learned and vvell learned) vvhich after they haue both reformed their liues, and conuerted their studies, haue not yet disdeyned to reade the Poems vvhich they let passe their pennes in youth. For it seemeth vntoo mee that in all ages Poetrie hath beene not onely permitted, but also it hath beene thought a right good and excellent qualitie. Next vnto this, I haue alvvayes bene of opinion, that it is not vnpossible eyther in Poemes or in Prose too vvrite both compendiously, and perfectly in our Englishe tongue. And therefore although I chalenge not vnto my selfe the name of an English Poet, yet may the Reader finde oute in my vvrytings, that I haue more faulted in keeping the olde English vvordes ( quamuis iam obsoleta ) than in borovving of other languages, such Epithetes and Adiectiues as smell of the Inkhorne. Thirdly, as I seeke aduauncement by vertue, so vvas I desirous that there might remaine in publike recorde, some pledge or token of those giftes vvhervvith it hath pleased the Almightie to endue me: To the ende that thereby the vertuous might bee incouraged to employ my penne in some exercise vvhich might tende both to my preferment, and to the profite of my Countrey. For many a man vvhich may like mine outvvarde presence, might yet haue doubted vvhether the qualityes of my minde had bene correspondent to the proportion of my bodie. Fourthly, bicause I had vvritte sundry things vvhich coulde not chuse but content the learned and Godlye Reader, therefore I hoped the same should serue as vndoubted proofe, that I had layde aside vanities, and delighted to exercise my penne in morall discourses, at least the one passing (cheeke by cheek) vvith the other, muste of necessitie persuade both the learned, and the light minded, that I coulde asvvell sovve good graine, as graynes or draffe. And I thought not meete (beeing intermingled as they vvere) to cast avvay a vvhole bushell of good seede, for tvvo or three graynes of Darnell or Cockle. Lastly, I persuaded my selfe that as in the better sort of the same I shoulde purchase good lyking vvith the honourable aged: So euen in the vvorst sorte, I might yet serue as a myrrour for vnbrydled youth, to auoyde those perilles vvhich I had passed. For little may he do vvhich hath escaped the rock or the sandes, if he cannot vvaft vvith his hande to them that come after him. These considerations (right reuerend) did first moue me to consent that these Poemes shoulde passe in print. For recapitulation vvhereof, and to ansvvere vnto the obiections that may bee giuen: I say to the first that I neither take example of wanton Ouid, doting Nigidius, nor foolish Samocratius. But I delight to thinke that the reuerend father Theodore Beza, vvhose life is vvorthily become a lanterne to the vvhole vvorlde, did not yet disdaine too suffer the continued publication of such Poemes as he vvrote in youth. And as he termed them at last Po emata castrata , So shal your reuerend iudgements beholde in this seconde edition, my Poemes gelded from all filthie phrases, corrected in all erronious places, and beautified vvith addition of many moral examples. To the seconde, although I be sometimes constreyned for the cadence of rimes, or per licentiam Poeticam , to vse an ynkehorne terme, or a straunge vvord: Yet hope I that it shall be apparant I haue rather regarde to make our natiue language commendable in it selfe, than gay vvith the feathers of straunge birdes. To the thirde reason may be obiected, that if I vvere so desirous to haue my capacitie knovvne, I shoulde haue done much better to haue trauelled in some notorious peece of vvorke, vvhich might generally haue spred my commendation. The vvhich I confesse. But yet is it true that I must take the Foord as I finde it: Sometimes not as I vvoulde, but as I may And since the ouersight of my youth had brought mee farre behinde hande and indebted vnto the vvorld, I thought good in the meane time to pay as much as I had, vntill it might please God better to inable me. For commonly the greediest creditor is appeased, if he see his debitor vvilling to pay vvhe he hath any thing. And therefore being busied in martiall affayres (vvhereby also I sought some aduauncement) I thought good to notifie vnto the vvorlde before my returne, that I coulde as vvell persuade vvith Penne, as pearce vvith launce or vveapon: So that yet some noble minde might be incouraged both to exercise me in time of peace, and to emploie mee in time of seruice in vvarre. To the fourth and last considerations, I had alledged of late by a right reuerende father, that although in deede out of euerie floure the industrious Bee may gather honie, yet by proofe the Spider thereout also sucks mischeeuous poyson. VVherevnto I can none othervvise ansvvere, but that he vvho vvill throvv a stone at euerie Dogge vvhich barketh, had neede of a great satchell or pocket. And if the learned iudgements and honest mindes doe both construe my doings aright, and take therein either councell or commoditie, then care I the lesse vvhat the vvicked conceyue of my conceytes. For I esteeme more the prayse of one learned Reader, than I regard the curious carping of ten thousande vnlettered tattlers. To conclude (right reuerend) as these considerations did specially moue me at first to consent to the imprinting of these posies, so novve haue I yet a further consideration vvhich moueth mee most earnestly to sue for this second edition or publishing of the same. And that is this. I vnderstande that sundrie vvell disposed mindes haue taken offence at certaine vvanton vvordes and sentences passed in the fable of Ferdinando Ieronimi , and the Ladie Elinora de Valasco , the vvhich in the first edition vvas termed The aduentures of master F. I. And that also thervvith some busie coniectures haue presumed to thinke that the same vvas indeed vvritten to the scandalizing of some vvorthie personages, vvhom they vvoulde seeme therby to knovv. Surely (right reuerend) I smile to see the simplicitie of such, vvho being indeed starke staring blind, vvould yet seeme to see farre into a milstone. And the rather I scorne their rash iudgements, for that in talking vvith .xx. of them one after another, there haue not tvvo agreed in one coniecture. Alas, alas, if I had bene so foolishe as to haue passed in recitall a thing so done in deede, yet all the vvorld might thinke me verie simple if I vvoulde call Iohn, Iohn, or Mary, Mary. But for the better satisfying of all men vniuersally, I doe here protest vnto you (reuerend) euen by the hope of my saluation, that there is no liuing creature touched or to be noted therby. And for the rest you shall find it novv in this second imprinting so turquened and turned, so clensed from all vnclenly vvordes, and so purged from the humor of inhumanitie, as percase you vvoulde not iudge that it vvas the same tale. For although I haue bin heretofore contented to suffer the publication thereof, only to the ende men might see my Methode and maner of vvriting, yet am I novve thus desirous to set it forth eftsoones, to the ende all men might see the reformation of my minde. And that all suspitions may be suppressed and throughly satisfied, by this mine vnfeined protestation vvhich I make vnto you in that behalfe. Finally, vvere it not that the same is alreadie extant in such sort as hath moued offence, I should rather be cotent to cancel it vtterly to obliuion, then thus to returne it in a nevv patched cote. And for full proofe of mine earnest zeale in Gods seruice, I require of you (reuerende) most instantly, that if hereby my skill seeme sufficient to vvade in matters of greater importance, you vvill then vouchsafe to employ mee accordingly. Surely you shall finde me no lesse readie to vndertake a vvhole yeares trauaile in anie vvorke vvhich you shall thinke me able to ouercome, than I haue beene vvilling heretofore to spende three houres in penning of an amorous Sonnet. Euen so being desirous that all men generally (and you especially) should conceiue of me as I meane, I haue thus farre troubled your lerned eies vvith this plaine Epistle, vvritten for my purgation, in matters vvhiche (else) might both haue offended you, and giuen great batterie to the ramparts of my poore credite. The God of peace vouchsafe to gouerne and product you, and me, and all his, in quiet of conscience, and strength of spirit. Amen. From my poore house at VValtamstovv in the Forest, this last day of Ianuarie. 1574. Gascoigne Esquire by birth, and Souldiour by profession, wisheth increase of knowledge in all vertuous exercises. here (as you see) published in print suche Posies and rymes as I vsed in my youth, the which for the barbarousnesse of the stile may seeme worthlesse, and yet for the doubtfulnesse of some darke places they haue also seemed (heretofore) daugerous. So that men may iustly both condemne me of rashnesse, and wonder at my simplicitie in suffering or procuring the same to be imprinted. A yong man well borne, tenderly fostered, and delicately accompanied, shall hardly passe ouer his youth without falling into some snares of the Diuell, and temptations of the flesh. But a man of middle yeares, who hath to his cost experimented the vanities of youth, and to his perill passed them: who hath bought repentance deare, and yet gone through vvith the bargaine: who seeth before his face the tyme past lost, and the rest passing away in post: Such a man had more neede to be well aduised in his doings, and resolute in his determinations. For with more ease and greater fauour may we answere for tenne madde follies committed in grene youth, than one sober ouersight escaped in yeares of discretion. Lycurgus the good princely Philosopher, ordeyned that if an olde man perceiuing a yong man to commit any dishonestie, did not rebuke but suffer him: the aged shoulde be chastised, and the yong man should be absolued. All this rehearsed and considered, you may (as I say) growe in some doubt, whether I were worse occupied in first deuising, or at last in publishing these toies  & pamphlets: and much the rather, for that it is a thing commonly seene, that (nowe adayes) fewe or no things are so well handled, but they shall bee carped at by curious Readers, nor almost any thing so well ment, but may bee muche misconstrued. And heerewithall I assure my selfe, that I shall bee generally condemned as a man verie lightly bent, and rather desyrous to continue in the freshe remembraunce of my follyes, than content too cancell them in obliuion by discontinuance: especially since in a house where many yong childre are, it hath bene thought better pollicie quite to quench out the fire, than to leaue any loose cole in the imbers, wherewith Babes may play and put the whole edifice in daunger. But my lustie youthes, and gallant Gentlemen, I had an intent farre contrarie vntoo all these supposes, when I fyrst permitmitted the publication heereof. And bycause the greatest offence that hath beene taken thereat, is, least your mindes might heereby become enuenomed with vanities, therefore vnto you I will addresse my tale, for the better satisfying of common iudgements. And vnto you I will explane, that which being before mistically couered, and commonly misconstrued, might be no lesse perillous in seducing you, than greeuous euidence for to proue mee guiltie of condemnation. Then to come vnto the matter, there are three sortes of men which (beeing wonderfully offended at this booke) haue founde therein three maner of matters (say they) verie reprehensible. The men are these: curious Carpers, ignorant Readers, and graue Philosophers. The faults they finde are, Iudicare in the Creede: Chalke for Cheese: and the comon infection of Loue. Of these three sorts of men and matters, I do but very little esteeme the two first. But I deeply regarde the thirde. For of a verie troth, there are one kinde of people nowadayes which will mislyke any thing, being bred (as I thinke) of the spawne of a Crab or Creuish, which in all streames and waters will swimme eyther sidewayes, or flat backwards: and when they can indeede finde none other fault, will yet thinke Iudicare verie vntowardlye placed in the Creede. Or (beeing a simple Sowter) will finde fault at the shape of the legge: or if they be not there stopped, they wil not spare to step vp higher, and say, that Apelles paynted Dame Venus verie deformed or euill fauoured. Of this sort I make small accounte, bycause indeede they seeke a knotte in the Rushe, and woulde seeme to see verie farre in a Mylstone. There are also certaine others, who (hauing no skill at all) will yet be verie busie in reading all that may bee read, and thinke it sufficient if (Parrot like) they can rehearse things without booke: when within booke they vnderstande neyther the meaning of the Authour, nor the sense of the figuratiue speeches, I will forbeare to recyte examples by any of mine owne doings. Since all comparisons are odious, I will not say how much the areignment and diuorce of a Louer (being written in ieast) haue bene mistaken in sad earnest. It shall suffice that the contentions passed in verse long sithence, betwene maister Churchyard and Camell , were (by a blockheaded reader) costrued to be indeed a quarell betwene two neighbors. Of whom that one hauing a Camell in keping, and that other hauing charge of the Churchyard, it was supposed they had grown to debate, bicause the Camell came into the Churchyarde. Laugh not at this (lustie yonkers) since the pleasant dittie of the noble Erle of Surrey (beginning thus: In winters iust returne ) was also construed to be made indeed by a Shepeherd. VVhat shoulde I stande much in rehersall how the L. Vaux his dittie (beginning thus: I loth that I did loue ) was thought by some to be made vpo his death bed? and that the Soulknill of M.Edwards was also written in extremitie of sicknesse. Of a truth (my good gallants) there are such as hauing only lerned to read English, do interpret Latin, Greke, French and Italian phrases or metaphors, eue according to their owne motherly conception and childish skill. The which (bicause they take Chalke for Cheese) shall neuer trouble me, whatsoeuer fault they finde in my doings. But the third sort (beeing graue Philosophers, and finding iust fault in my doings at the common infection of loue) I must needes alledge suche iuste excuse as may counteruayle their iuste complaynts. For else I shoulde remayne woorthie of a seuere punishment. They wysely considering that wee are all in youth nore apt to delight in harmefull pleasures, then to disgest wholesome and sounde aduice, haue thought meete to forbid the publishing of any ryming tryfles which may serue as whetstones to sharpen youth vnto vanities. And for this cause, finding by experience also, how the first Copie of these my Posies hath beene verie much iuquired for by the yonger sort: and hearing likewise that (in the same) the greater part hath beene written in pursute of amorous enterpryses, they haue iustly conceyued that the continuance thereof hath beene more likely to stirre in all yong Readers a venemous desire of vanitie, than to serue as a common myrrour of greene and youthfull imperfections. VVherevnto I must confesse, that as the industrious Bee may gather honie out of the most stinking weede, so the malicious Spider may also gather poyson out of the fayrest floure that growes. And yet in all this discourse I see not proued, that either that Gardener is too blame which planteth his Garden full of fragrant floures neyther that planter to be dispraysed: which soweth all his beddes with seedes of wholesome herbes: neyther is that Orchard vnfruitfull, which (vnder show of sundrie weedes) hath medicinable playsters for all infirmities. But if the Chirurgian which should seeke Sorrell to rypen an Vlcer, will take Rewe which may more inflame the Impostume, then is hee more to blame that mistooke his gathering, than the Gardener which planted aright, and presented store and choyse to be taken. Or if the Phisition will gather hote Perceley in stead of cold Endiue, shall he not worthily beare the burthen of his owne blame? To speake English, it is your vsing (my lustie Gallants) or misvsing of these Posies that may make me praysed or dispraysed for publishing of the same. For if you (where you may learne to auoyd the subtile sandes of wanton desire) will runne vpon the rockes of vnlawfull lust, then great is your folly, and greater will growe my rebuke. If you (where you might gather wholesome hearbes to cure your sundrie infirmities) will spende the whole day in gathering of sweete smelling Posies, much will be the time that you shal mispende, and much more the harme that you shall heape vpon my heade. Or if you will rather beblister your handes with a Nettle, then comfort your senses by smelling to the pleasant Marioram, then wanton is your pastime, and small will be your profite. I haue here presented you with three sundrie sortes of Posies: Floures, Hearbes, and VVeedes . In which diuision I haue not ment that onely the floures are to bee smelled vnto, nor that onely the VVeedes are to be reiected. I terme some Floures, bycause being indeed inuented vpon a verie light occasion, they haue yet in them (in my iudgement) some rare inuention and Methode before not commonly vsed. And therefore (beeing more pleasant than profitable) I haue named them Floures. The seconde (being indeede morall discourses, and reformed inuentions, and therefore more profitable than pleasant) I haue named Hearbes. The third (being VVeedes) might seeme to some iudgements, neither pleasant nor yet profitable, and therefore meete to bee cast away. But as many weedes are right medicinable, so may you find in this none so vile or stinking, but that it hath in it some vertue if it be rightly handled. Mary you must take heede how you vse the For if you delight to put Hemlocke in your fellowes pottage, you may chaunce both to poyson him, and bring your selfe in perill. But if you take example by the harmes of others who haue eaten it before you, then may you chaunce to become so warie, that you will looke aduisedly on all the Perceley that you gather, least amongst the same one braunch of Hemlock might anoy you. I assure you, my yong blouds, I haue not published the same to the intent that other men hereafter might be infected with my follies forepassed. For though it be a comfort in miserijs habere consortem , yet is it small consolation to a fellon, to haue a Coyner hanged in his companie. And I assure you (although you will think it straunge) that I haue not caused them to bee imprinted for anie vaine delight which I haue (my selfe) therein conceyued. For the most of them being written in my madnesse, might haue yeelded then more delight to my frantike fansie to see them published, than they now do accumulate cares in my minde to set them forth corrected: and a deformed youth had bene more likely to set them to sale long sithence, than a reformed man can be able now to protect them with simplicitie. The scope of mine intent, and the marke whereat I shoote is double. I meane grounded vpon two sundrie causes: the one that being indebted vnto the worlde (at the least fiue thousande dayes verie vainly spent) I may yeeld him yet some part of mine account in these Poemes. VVherein as he may finde great diuersitie both in stile and sense, so may the good bee incouraged to set mee on worke at last, though it were noone before I sought seruice. The other reason is, that bicause I haue (to mine owne great detriment) mispent my golden time, I may serue as ensample to the youthfull Gentlemen of England, that they runne not vpon the rocks which haue brought me to shipwracke. Beware therefore, lustie Gallants, howe you smell to these Posies. And learne you to vse the talent which I haue highly abused. Make me your myrrour. And if hereafter you see me recouer mine estate, or reedifie the decayed walls of my youth, then beginne you sooner to builde some foundation which may beautifie your Pallace. If you see me sinke in distresses (notwithstanding that you iudge me quick of capacitie) then lerne you to mainteyne your selues swimming in prosperitie, and eschue betymes the whirlepoole of misgouernment. Finally, I beseech you, and coniure you, that you rather encourage me to accomplish some worthier trauaile, by seeing these Posies right smelled vnto, than discourage me from attempting other labours, when I shall see these first fruites reiected or misused. I haue corrected them from sundrie faultes. VVhich if they had not brought suspition in the first copie, be you then out of doubt you had neuer bene troubled with these seconde presents, nor persuaded to flourishe wisely with a two edged swoorde in your naked hands. But as I haue ment them well, so I craue of God, that they may both pleasure and profite you for the furtherance of your skill in any commendable enterprise. From my poore house at VValtamstow in the Forest the second of Ianuarie, 1575 to the Romaines in his .xv. Chapter. And in his ninth Chapter of his first Epistle to the Corinthians, hee glorieth that hee coulde (as it were) transforme himself into all professions, therby to winne all kinde of men to God: saying that with the Iewes he became a Iew: with them that were vnder the law, he seemed also vnder the lawe: with the feeble, he shewed himselfe feeble. And to conclude, he became all things to all men, to the ende that hee might thereby winne some to saluation. My Schoolemaster which taught me Grammer, woulde alwayes say that some schollers he woonne to studie by strypes, some other by fayre meanes, some by promises, some other by prayses, some by vainglorie, and some by verie shame. But I neuer hard him repent him that euer he had persuaded any scholler to become studious, in what sort soeuer it were that hee woonne him. For whether the braue Gennet be broken with the bitte, or with the snaffle, whither he be brought in awe with a Spurre, or with a wand, all is one if he proue readie and well mouthed. Thus much I write (gentle Reader) to the ende that myne intent may appeare in publishing of these Posies. VVherein as there are many things morall, so are there also some verses more sauced with wantonnesse than with wisedome. And as there are some ditties which may please and delight the godly and grauer sort, so are there some which may allure the yonger sort vnto fond attempts. But what for that? Hath Terence bene forbidden to be read, bicause his Comedies are rehearsals of many madde prankes played by wanton youthes? No surely. Paracelsus , and sundrie other Phisitions and Philosophers, declare, that in euerie thing naturall there is to be founde Salt, Oyle, and Brimstone. And I am of opinion, that in euery thing which is written (the holy scriptures excepted) there are to be founde wisedome, follie, emulation, and detraction. For as I neuer yet saw any thing so clerkly handled, but that therein might be found some imperfections: So coulde I neuer yet reade fable so ridiculous but that therein some morallitie might be gathered. And as the good writer shall be sure of some to bee maliced: so the bad shall neuer escape the byting tongues of slaunderers. But to returne to my purpose: If in the hardest flint there may be found sparkes of liuely fire, and the most knottie peece of Box, may be wrought to a fayre Doogen haste: let these fewe suffice to persuade thee, that I haue not procured the publication heereof to any ende, so much as that the youthful sort might therein take example, and the aged recreation. Nowe if any (misgouerning their owne wittes) doe fortune to vse that for a Spurre, which I had heere appoynted for a Brydle, I can none otherwise lamet it, but to say that I am not the first which hath bene misiudged. Truely (gentle Reader) I protest that I haue not ment heerein to displease any man, but my desire hath rather bene to cotent most men: I meane the diuine with godly Hymnes and Psalmes, the sober minde with morall discourses, and the wildest will with sufficient warning. The which if it so fall out, then shall I thinke my selfe right happie. And if it fall out otherwise, I shall yet neuer bee ashamed to become one of their corporation which reape floutes and reprehension for their trauayles. But bicause these Posies growe to a great bundell, and thereof also the number of louing lynes exceedeth in the Superlatiue, I thought good to aduertise thee, that the most part of them were written for other men. And out of all doubt, if euer I wrote lyne for myselfe in causes of loue, I haue written tenne for other men in layes of lust. For I counte greater difference betweene loue and lust, than there is diuersitie betweene witte and wisedome: and yet witte and I did (in youth) make such a fray, that I feare his cosen wisedome will neuer become freendes with me in my age. VVell, though my folly bee greater than my fortune, yet ouergreat were mine vnconstancie, if (in mine owne behalfe) I shoulde compyle so many sundrie Songs or Sonets. I haue heard of an honest plaine meaning Citizen, who (being ouercharged with many matters in the lawe, and hearing of a common solicitor of causes in the Citie) came home to comfort his wife, and tolde hir that he had heard of one which dwelt at Billingsgate, that coulde helpe all men. Euen so (good Reader) I was a great while the man which dwelt at Billingsgate. For in wanton delightes I helped all men, though in sad earnest I neuer furthered my selfe any kinde of way. And by that it proceedeth, that I haue so often chaunged my Posie or worde. For when I did compile any thing at the request of other men, if I had subscribed the same with mine owne vsuall mot or deuise, it might haue bewrayed the same to haue beene of my doing. And I was euer curious in that behalfe, as one that was lothe to bewray the follies of other men. And yet (as you see) I am not verie daungerous to lay my selfe wide open in view of the worlde, I haue also sundrie tymes chaunged mine owne worde or deuise. And no meruaile: For he that wandereth much in those wildernesses, shall seldome continue long in one minde. VVell, it were follie to bewayle things which are vnpossible to be recouered, sithence Had I wist doth seldome serue as a blasone of good vnderstanding. And therefore I will spende no more wordes in this Preface, but I pray thee to smell vnto these Posies, as Floures to comfort, Herbes to cure , and VVeedes to be auoyded . So haue I ment them, and so I beseech thee Reader to accept them. Farewell. To bring forth corne, (through helpe of heauenly might) And eke esteeme the simple wretches toyle, VVhose painefull handes doe labour day and night. VVe prayse the ground, whereon the herbes do grow, VVhich heale or helpe, our greeues and mortall paine, Yea weedes haue worth, wherein we vertue know, For natures Art, nothing hath made in vaine. VVe prayse those floures which please the secrete sense, And do content, the tast or smell of man, The Gardners paynes and worke we recompence, That skilfull is, or aught in cunning can. But much more prayse to Gascoignes penne is due, VVhose learned hande doth here to thee present, A Posie full of Hearbes, and Flowers newe, To please all braynes, to wit or learning bent. Howe much the minde doth passe the sense or smell, So much these Floures all other do excell. Haue well renued, what winters wrath hath torne, And that we see, the wholesome smelling Floures, Begin to laugh rough winters wracke to scorne: If then by chaunce, or choyce of owners will, VVe roame and walke in place of rare delightes, And therein finde, what Arte or natures skill Can well see forth to feede our hungrie sightes: Yea more, if then the owner of the soyle, Doth licence yeelde to vse all as our owne, And gladly thinkes, the fruites of all his toyle, To our behoofe to be well set and sowne. It cannot be, but this so great desart In basest breast doth breede this due regarde, VVith worlde of thankes, to prayse this friendly part, And wish that woorth mought pay a iust rewarde. Good Reader then, beholde what gallant spring This booke brings forth, of fruites of finest sortes, Be bolde to take, thy list of euerie thing, For so is ment. And for thy glad disportes The paine was tane: therefore lo this I craue, In his behalfe, that wrote this pleasant worke, VVith care and cost, (and then most freely gaue His labours great, wherein great treasures lurke: To thine auayle) let his desartes now binde thee, In woorde and deede, he may still thankfull finde thee. And lie like lumpes, in filthie farrowed wise, Do (for a time) most ougly beastes appeare, Till dammes deare tongue, do cleare their clozed eyes. The gadde of steele, is likewise blunt and blacke, Till file and fire, do frame it sharpe and bright: Yea precious stones, their glorious grace do lacke, Till curious hand, do make them please the sight. And so these floures, although the grounde were gay, VVhereon they grew, and they of gallant hew, Yet till the badde were cullde and cast away, The best became the worse by such a crew. (For my part) then: I lyked not their smell, But as they be, I like them pretly well. May represent Parnassus springs indeede. VVhere Pallas with hir wise and learned crew, Did plant great store, and sow much cunning seede. That Goddesse then, on whom the Muses wayte, To garde hir grounde from greedie gathrers spoyle, Hath here ordeynde, by fine and close conceyte, A greene knight chiefe, and master of the soyle. Such badge beares he that beautified this booke VVith glorious shew, of sundrie gallant flowers. But since he first this labor vndertooke, He gleand thereout, (to make the profite ours) A heape of Hearbes, a sort of fruitfull seedes, A needefull salue, compound of needlesse weedes. All these (with more) my freend here freely giues: Nor naked wordes, nor streyne of straunge deuise. But Gowers minde, which now in Gascoigne liues, Yeeldes heere in view, (by iudgement of the wise) His penne, his sworde, himselfe, and all his might, To Pallas schoole, and Mars in Princes right. (And euery coyne is iudgde and found, by weight, by stamp, or show) Yet doth the prayse of men, giue gold a double grace, And makes both pearls and Iewels rich, desirde in euery place. The horse full finely formde, whose pace and traine is true, Is more esteemde for good report, than likte for shape and view. Yea sure, ech man himselfe, for all his wit and skill, (If world bestow no lawde on him) may sleepe in silence still. Fame shewes the value first, of euerie precious thing, And winnes with lyking all the brute, that doth the credit bring. And fame makes way before, to workes that are vnknowne And peoples loue is caried ther, where fame hir trump hath blown. A cunning workman fine, in Cloyster close may sit, And carue or paint a thousand things, and vse both art and wit, Yet wanting worldes renowne, may scape vnsought or seene: It is but fame that outruns all, and gets the goal I weene. The learned Doctors lawd, that heales where other harmes, By comon prayse of peoples voyce, brings pacients in by swarmes. A goodly stately house, hath seldome any fame, Till world behold the buildings through, and people see the same. The Flowers and Posies sweete, in better price are held, VVhen those haue praysde their vertues rare, that haue their odor smeld. So by these foresayd proofes, I haue a pardon free, To speake, to write, and make discourse, of any worke I see, That worthie is of prayse: for prayse is all we get. Present the worlde with labors great, the world is in your det, It neuer yeeldes rewarde, nor scarce iust prayse will giue: Then studie out to stand on fame, and striue by fame to liue. Our olde forefathers wise, saw long before these dayes, How sone faint world would fail deserts, and cold would wax our prayse. And knowing that disdeyne, for toyle did rather rise, Than right renowne (whose golde buds, growes vp to starry skies) Betooke their labors long, and euery act they did, Vnto the Gods, from whose deepe sight, no secret can be hid. And these good gracious Gods, sent downe from heauens hie, (For noble minds) an endlesse fame, that throw the world doth flie. VVhich fame is due to those, that seeke by new deuice, To honor learning euery way, and Vertue bring in price. From Knowledge gardeyn gay, where science sowes hir seedes, A pretie Posie gathered is, of Flowers, Hearbes , and VVeedes . The Flowers by smel are found, the hearbs their goodnes showes, The VVeedes amid both hearbs & flowers, in decet order growes. The soft and tender nose, that can no weedes abide, May make his choise of holesome hearbes, whose vertues well are tride. The fine and flowing wittes, that feede on straunge delites, May tast (for seasning daintie mouthes) the bitter weede that bites: The well disposed minde, and honest meaning man, Shall finde (in floures) proude Peacoks plumes, and feathers of the Swan. The curst and crabbed Carle, that Posies flings away, By this (perhaps) may find some cause, with prettie floures to play. The kinde and louing worme, that woulde his ladie please, My light on some such medcin here, shal do them both much ease. The Lad that lykes the schoole, and will good warning take: May snatch some rules oute of this booke, that may him doctor make. The hastie trauayling head, that flies to foreyne place, May wey by this what home is woorth, and stay his rouing race. The manly courage stoute, that seeketh fame full farre, Shall find by this how sweete is peace, and see how soure is warre. This Posie is so pickt, and choysely sorted throw, There is no Flower, Herbe, nor VVeede, but serues some purpose now. Then since it freely comes, to you for little cost, Take well in worth these paynes of him, that thinkes no labor lost: To do his countrie good, as many others haue, VVho for their toyles a good report, of worlde did onely craue. Grudge not to yeeld some fame, for fruites that you receyue, Make some exchaunge for franke good will, some signe or token leaue, To shew your thankfull harts. For if you loue to take, And haue a conscience growne so great, you can no gift forsake, And cannot giue againe, that men deserue to reape, Adieu we leaue you in the hedge, and ore the stile we leape. And yet some stile or verse, we after shape in ryme, That may by arte shewe you a Glasse, to see your selues in tyme. Thus wish I men their right: and you that iudge amisse, To mend your minds, or frame your Muse, to make the like of this. For all these pleasant Posies here, bound vp in sundrie sort. The flowers fayre and fresh, were set with painefull toyle, Of late in Gascoignes Garden plot, a passing pleasant soyle. Now weedes of little worth, are culde from out the rest, VVhich he with double paine, did work, to gleane the bad fro best. The state is very straunge, and fortune rare in vse, VVhose heauie happe he neither helpes, nor blazeth their abuse. In thundring verse he wrayes, where highest mindes be thrall, VVhere mischeefe seekes to rayse it selfe, by force of others fall He pluckes the visour of, from maskes of peeuish pride, And wrayes what sowre (in sweet pretece) the coustly corts ca hide. In euerie gallant flower, he setteth forth to show, Of Venus thralles, the hap, the harme, the want, the weale, the woe. He finely findes their faultes, whose welth doth foster wrong, VVho toucheth sinne (without offence) must plainly sing his song. His loftie vaine in verse, his stately stile in prose, Foretelles that Pallas ment by him, for to defende hir foes. VVherwith to Mars his might, his lustie limmes are knit, (A sight most rare) that Hectors mind, should match with Pallas wit. By proofe of late appeared (how so reportes here ran) That he in field was formost still, in spoyle the hynmost man. No backward blastes could bruse the valour of his thought, Although slie hap, forestoode his hope, in that he credite sought. In fortunes spight he straue, by vertues to aspire, Resolude when due deserts might mount, then he should haue his hire Thus late with Mars in field, a lustie Souldiour shewde, And now with peace in Pallas schoole, he freendly hath bestowde, On thee this heape of flowers, the fruites of all his toyle, VVhereof if some but simple seeme, consider well the soyle. They grew not all at home, some came from forreyne fieldes, The which (percase) set here againe, no pleasant sauour yeeldes. Yet who mislyketh most, the worst will hardly mend, And he were best not write at all, which no man will offend. As neede repines, to see his neighbour ritche: And slaunder chafes, where vertues prosper well, As sicke men thinke, all others health to mitch: Such filthie faultes, mens harts ofttymes inflame, That spight presumes, to stayne the worthies name. Are brutall things, transferred so to men? Or men become more sauage than the beast? VVe see the dogge, that kenelles in his den, (For onely foode) obeyes his Lordes behest: Yea more than that, remembers so reliefe, As (in his kinde) he mournes at masters griefe. If thou perceyue, whereto my tale intendes, Then (slaunder) cease to wrong a frendly wight, VVho for his countreys good, his trauayle spendes, Sometime where blowes are giuen in bloudie fight: And other tymes he frames with skilfull pen, Such verse, as may content eche moulde of men. As nowe beholde, he here presentes to thee, The blossoms fayre, of three well sorted seedes. The first he feynes, fresh Flowers for to bee: The second Herbes, the last he termeth VVeedes. All these, the soyle of his well fallowed brayne, (VVith Pallas droppes bedewde) yeeldes for thy gaine. The Hearbes to graue conceyt, and skilfull age, The fragrant Flowers to sent of yonger smell: The worthlesse VVeedes, to rule the wantonrage Of recklesse heades, he giues: then vse them well: And gather (friend) but neyther spight nor spoyle, These Posies made, by his long painfull toyle. And venturde for to write a verse, before I knewe the same. So that I was deceyude, for when it came to light, The booke deserued no such worde, as I therein did wright. Thus lept I ere I lookt, and wandred ere I wist, VVhich giues (me haggard) warning since, to trust no falkners fist. And yet the booke was good, (by hap and not my skill) But not a Booke of such contentes, as might my wordes fulfill. VVell now I neede not feare, these Posies here to prayse, Bicause I knew them euery flower, and where they grew alwayes. And sure for my conceyt, euen when they bloomed first, Me thought they smelt not much amisse, no not the very worst. Perhappes some daintie nose, no Batchlers button lykes, And some at Pimpernell and Pinkes, a slender quarell pykes. Some thinke that Gillyflowers, do yeeld a gelous smell, And some (which like none herbe but Sage) say Finkell tastes not well. Yet Finkell is of force, and Gillyflowers are good, And Pinks please some, and Pimpernell doth serue to steynch the blood: And Batchlers buttons be, the brauest to beholde, But sure that flower were best not grow, which can abide no colde. For slaunder blowes so shrill, with easterne enuious windes, And frosts of frumps so nip the rootes, of vertuous meaning minds That few good flowers can thriue, vnlesse they be protected, Or garded from suspitious blastes, or with some proppes erected. So seemeth by the wight, which gardened this grounde, And set such flowers on euery bed, that Posies here abounde. Yet some tongues cannot well, affoorde him worthie prayse, And by our Lorde they do him wrong, for I haue sene his wayes, And marked all his moodes, and haue had proofe likewise, That he can do as well in field, as pen can here deuise. Not many Monthes yet past, I saw his doughtie deedes, And since (to heare what slaunder sayes) my heauie hart it bleedes. Yet Reader graunt but this, to trie before thou trust, So shalt thou find his flowers and him, both gallant, good and iust. VVhich strayned were by loftie learnings lore: Could not content the surly for their share, Ne cause them once, to yeeld him thankes therefore: Such was his hap, when first in hande he tooke, By labor long, to bring to light this Booke. Yet hath he not (for all this) seemde to cease, Those Flowers fresh againe in ground to set, And yeeld them earth to bring forth their increase, VVith other slippes from forraine soyle yfet. VVhich he hath gaynde by hazarde of his life, In bloudie broyles, where pouldred shot was rife. This endlesse toyle, contented well his minde, Hope helde the helme, his Fame on shore to set: His deepe desire, was friendship for to finde, At readers handes, he nought else sought to get: VVherefore (doubtlesse) they did him double wrong, VVhich F. and I. mysconstrued haue so long. Yet least I should passe from the golden ground, Of Gascoignes plat, wherein those Posies grew, I list to tell what Flowers there I found, And paint by penne, the honour to him dew: Since that his toyle doth well deserue the same, And sacred skill hath so aduaunst his name. First did I finde the Flower of Fetters frute, VVhereof my selfe haue tasted to my paine: Then might I see the Greene knight touch the Lute, VVhose cordes were coucht on frettes of deepe disdaine: And likewise there, I might perceyue full well, That fragrant Flower which Fansie bad farewell. In fine I found the flowre that Bellum hight, Sweete vnto those, of sillie simple sense, Yet sharpe and sowre, to those that do delight In martiall martes, for gaine of peuish pense. Such buddes full braue, good Gascoignes Garden gaue To all estates, which list the same to haue. VVherefore (good friend) flie enuies yrkesome yre, And tred the trace, which Reasons rule hath wrought, Yeeld not disdeyne to Gascoigne for his hyre, VVhose brused braine for thee these flowers hath sought. Least if thou do, the blame on thee do light, Such friendly paynes to recompence with spight. And Galen he in Phisicks arte doth many men excell, If Poets olde deseruen prayse, by paynting out aright, The frutes of vice, as Ouid doth, and many mo that wright, By learned skill of many things: If such exalt their name, And for their hyre, deserued prayse by trumpe of Ladie Fame: VVhy should the Authour of this booke then leese his due desart, Sith he so freendly here to vs, hath shewed his skilfull arte? The healthsome herbs and flowers sweet, fro weedes he hath diuided, The fruits of Giues in prison strog he hath right wel decided. Of warres also, and warriours to, euen like a Martiall knight, He hath discourst, and shewed the lottes, that therevpon do light: Virgill is dead, and Galen gone, with Poets many more: Yet workes of theirs be still aliue, and with vs kept in store. This Authour liues, and Gascoigne hights, yet once to die most sure, Alas the while that worthie wightes may not alwayes endure, But workes of his among the best, for euer more shall rest, VVhen he in heauen shall take a place prepared for the blest. And Gower got a worthie name: Sweete Surrey , suckt Pernassus springs, And VViat wrote of wondrous things: Olde Rochfort clambe the stately Throne, VVhich Muses holde, in Hellicone . Then thither let good Gascoigne go, For sure his verse, deserueth so. nientedi meno, l'opere virtuose meritano sempremai ogni laude, honore,  & mercede.

Ingenioque pari possunt disponere partas Materias, pedibus si incedunt Carmina certis, Claudunturque suis numeris: Si turba sororum, Supplicibus potis est priscos inflare furores, Sed si quod magis est, nostri sua themata texant, Consona scripturis sacris, nec dissona rectis Moribus: amaenos, sed quae cognoscere flores Virtutis, quae docent dulces colligere fructus. Si fictas fabulas, falsique Cupidinis artes Cum Venere excludunt, (vt docta indigna poesi) Cur non censemus celebrandos iure Coronis Æquales virtute viros, aequalibus esse?

Incassunque suos, non sinit ire dies: Haec tua Gasconi laus est, mercede remota Hac, friget virtus, haec tibi sufficiat. Haec tibi (seu Belgas repetas, Martemque ferocem, Seu patriam & Musas) inuiolata Comes. Laetaque vix totuit, dicere lingua bene est: Mox vbi quae voluit, libro non vidit in illo, Magnaque quae fuerat, pars ibi parua fuit, Quam male ait socio, Martem secreuit amore? Qui bene amat pugnat, qui bene pugnat amat. Militiamque tuli, non vno nomine duram Arma quibus laetabar, Ego Tritonia Pallas, Pallas ego trado arma tibi, & nunc per iuga Cynthi Per sacrum te Hellicona tuus, per Thessala Tempe Insequor, aeternumque sequar, dum sydera mundum, Dum deus aeternos, certo moderamine Coelos Dirigat, aethereasque animas & sydera Coeli. O quae felices caelesti nectare mentes Perfundis, Diuumque doces nos dicere Cantus, Quales Aonias inter celiberrima turbas Calliopaea canit, vel gestis Clio loquendis Nata.

Perlege scripta prius, quam pergas scripta probare, Et bene perlectis, inde videbis opus. Nam nihil in titulum, iuuat inspexisse libelli, Si vis materiae sit tibi nota minus. Non etenim primo veniunt fundamina rerum, Sed sunt in varijs, inspicienda locis. Perge igitur quo sit pergendum, fine reperto, In tenebris tum quae dilituere proba. Sique fuit Graijs debitus vllus honos, Graecia si quondam vatem suspexit Homerum, Si domitrix magni Roma Maronis opus, Cur non Gasconij facunda poemata laudat Anglia? & ad coeli sydera summa ferat?

Non ita, ni forsan, velit ijsdem lector abuti, Non obsunt, pura si modo mente legas. What neede I speake my self, since other say so much? Who seme to praise these poesies so, as if ther wer none such? But sure my silly self, do find therein no smell, Which may deserue such passing prayse, or seeme to taste so well, This boone I onely craue, that Readers yet will deigne (If any weede herein do seeme, his fellow flowres to stayne) Then reade but others workes, and marke if that they finde, No toyes therein which may dislike, some modest readers minde? Reade Virgills Pryapus , or Ouids wanton verse, Which he about Corinnaes couche, so clerkly can rehearse. Reade Faustoes filthy tale, in Ariostoes ryme, And let not Marots Alyx passe, without impeach of crime. These things considred well, I trust they will excuse This maze of mine, although she seem, such toyes somtimes to vse. Beleeue me Lordings all, it is a Poetes parte, To handle eche thing in his kinde, for therein lieth his arte: Lucillius ledde the daunce, and Horace made the lawe, That poetes by Aucthoritie, may call (A dawe) A Dawe , And eke (a hore) A Hore , but yet in cleanly wordes, So that the vice may be rebukt, as though it were in bourdes: This phrase sometimes I vse, which (if it be a faute) Condempne not all the rest therfore, that here in verse is taught, Smell euery poesie right, and you therein shall finde, Fresh flowres, good hearbes, & holsome weedes, to please a skilfull minde. FINIS.  Tam Marti, quam Mercurio.

In the pleasant Countrie of Lombardie , (and not farre from the Citie of Florence ) there was dwelling sometimes a Lorde of many riche Seignories and dominions, who neuerthelesse bare his name of the Castle of Valasco : this Lord had one only sonne and two daughters: his sonne was called (during the life of his father) the heyre of Valasco , who maried a faire Gentlewoman of the house of Bellauista named Leonora : the elder daughter of the Lord of Valasco was called Francischina , a yong woman very toward, bothe in capacitie and other actiue qualities. Nowe the Lord of Valasco hauing already maried his sonne  & heyre, and himselfe drawing in age, was desirous to see his daughters also bestowed before his death, and especially the eldest, who both for beutie and ripenesse of age might often put him in remembrance that shee was a collop of his owne fleshe: and therefore sought meanes to draw vnto his house Ferdinando Ieronimi a yong gentleman of Venice , who delighting more in hawking, hunting, and such other pastimes than he did in studie, had left his owne house in Venice , and was come into Lombardie to take the pleasures of the countrie. So that the Lorde of Valasco knowing him to be of a very good parentage, and therewithall not onely riche but adorned with sundrie good qualities, was desirous (as is sayd) to drawe him home to his house (vnder pretence of hunting and hawking) to the end he might beholde his fayre daughter Francischina : who both for parentage and other worldly respects, might no lesse content his minde, than hir beautie was likely to haue allured his liking. But it fell oute farre contrary to his desire, for Ferdinando Ieronimi beholding the Lady Leonora , who was in deede very fayre, and of a very courtlike behauiour, became enamoured of hir, and forgetting the curtesie that the Lorde of Valasco had shewed him in entertayning him and his seruaunts, with their horses, by the space of .iiij. moneths (whiche is a rare curtesie nowe adayes, and especially in suche a countrey) he sought all meanes possible to make the heyre of Valasco a Becco . And to the end that all menne may perceiue what frutes growe on suche trees, and what issues come of such intents, I will set downe in English the fable as it is written in Italian by Bartello . And bicause I do suppose that Leonora is the same name whiche wee call Elinor in English, and that Francischina also doth import none other than Fraunces , I will so entitle them as to our own countriemen may be moste perspicuous. Understand you then, that Ferdinando hauing nowe a hote affection vnto the sayde Dame Elynor , and thinking it meeter to vtter his firste conceipts in writing than in speache, did write vnto hir as followeth. this Countrie) my good happe hath bene to behold you to my no small contentation. And my euill happe accompanies the same with suche imperfection of my deserts, as that I finde alwayes a ready repulse in mine owne forwardnesse:    [   The ayre of that Countrie did (by all likelyhood) seeme colder to him than ye streetes of Uenice.  ] So that considering the naturall clymate of the countrie, I muste say that I haue found fire in frost. And yet comparing the inequalitie of my deserts, with the least part of your worthinesse, I feele a cotinuall frost, in my most feruent fire. Such is the the extremitie of my passions, the whiche I could neuer haue bene content to committe vnto this teltale paper, were it not that I am destitute of all other helpe. Accept therefore I beseche you, the earnest good will of a more trustie (than worthy) seruaunt, who being thereby encouraged, may supplie the defects of his abilitie with readie triall of duetifull loyaltie. And lette this poore paper (besprent with salte teares, and blowen ouer with skalding sighes) bee saued of you as a safegarde for your sampler, or a bottome to winde your sowing silke, that when your last needelfull is wrought, you maye returne to reading thereof and consider the care of hym who is More youres than his owne. F. I. This letter by hir receyued, hir aunswere was this: She tooke occasion one day, at his request to daunce with him: the whiche doing, shee bashfully began to declare vnto him, that she had read ouer the writing whiche he deliuered vnto hir: with like protestation, that (as at deliuerie thereof, shee vnderstood not for what cause he thrust the same into hir bosome,) so now shee could not perceyue thereby any part of his meaning: neuerthelesse at laste seemed to take vppon hir the matter, and though shee disabled hir selfe, yet gaue him thankes as  &c. Whereupon he brake the braule, and walking abrode, deuised immediatly these fewe verses following.  With deawe bedimmd King Dauids eies that ruled Israell. And Salomon him selfe, the source of sapience, Against the force of such assaultes could make but small defence: To it the stoutest yeeld, and strongest feele like wo. Bold Hercules and Sampson both, did proue it to be so. What wonder seemeth then? when starres stand thicke in skies, If such a blasing starre haue power to dim my dazled eyes? To you these fewe suffise, your wittes be quicke and good, You can coniect by chaunge of hew, what humors feede my blood. F. I.  Before he culd put these verses in legible writing, it pleased M. Elinor of hir curtesie thus to deale with him. Walking in a garden among diuers other gentlemen  & gentlewomen, with a little frowning smyle in passing by him, she deliuered vnto him a paper, with these words. For that I vnderstand not (quoth she) the intent of your letters, I pray you take them here againe, and bestow them at your pleasure . The which done and sayde, shee passed by withoute change either of pace or countenaunce. Ferdinando somewhat troubled with hir angrie looke, did sodenly leaue the companie, and walking into a parke neare adioyning, in great rage began to wreake his malice on this poore paper, and the same did rend and teare in peeces. When sodenly at a glaunce he perceued it was not of his owne hand writing, and there withall abashed, vppon better regard he perceiued in one peece therof written in Romaine these letters Colei: which in english betokeneth SHE : wherfore placing all the peeces therof, as orderly as he could, he found therin written, these few lynes hereafter following. lacke of chosen company too returne vntoo my worke, wherein I did so long continue, till at the last the bare bottome did drawe vnto my remembraunce your straunge request. And although I founde therin no iust cause to credite your coloured wordes, yet haue I thought good hereby too requite you with like curtesie, so that at least you shall not condemne mee for vngratefull. But as to the matter therin conteyned: if I could perswade my selfe, that there were in mee any coales to kyndle suche sparkes of fire, I might yet peraduenture bee drawn to beleue that your minde were frosen with like feare. But as no smoke ariseth, where no cole is kindled, so without cause of affection the passion is easie to be cured. This is all that I vnderstand of your darke letters: and as much as I meane to answere. Colei: in english: SHE . was not hir owne deuise. And therin I haue no lesse allowed his iudgement, than commended his inuention of the verses, and letters before rehersed. For as by the stile this letter of hirs bewrayeth that it was not penned by a womans capacitie; so the sequele of hir doings may discipher, that shee had mo redy clearkes than trustie seruants in store. Well yet as the perfect hound, when he hath chased the hurt deere, amidde the whole heard, will neuer giue ouer till he haue singled it againe. Euen so Ferdinando though somwhat abashed with this doubtfull shewe, yet stil constant in his former intention, ceased not by all possible meanes, too bring this Deere yet once agayne to the bowes, wherby shee might be the more surely stryken: and so in the end enforced to yeeld. Wherfore he thought not best to commit the sayde verses willingly into hir custodie, but priuily lost them in hir chamber, written in counterfeit. And after on the next day thought better to replie, either vpon hir, or vppon hir Secretary in this wise as here followeth. to reply vnto: neuerthelesse in myne owne defence, thus much I alleage: that if my sodein departure pleased not you, I cannot my selfe therwith be pleased, as one that seeketh not to please many, and more desirous to please you than any. The cause of myne affection, I suppose you behold dayly. For (self loue auoyded) euery wight may iudge of themselues as much as reason perswadeth: the which if it be in your good nature suppressed with bashfulnesse, then mighty Ioue graunt, you may once behold my wan cheekes washed in woe, that therein my salt teares may be a myrrour to represent your owne shadow, and that like vnto Nacissus you may be constrayned to kisse the cold waues, wherein your counterfait is so liuely portrayed. For if aboundance of other matters fayled to drawe my gazing eyes in contemplation of so rare excellency, yet might these your letters both frame in me an admiration of such diuine esprite, and a confusion too my dull vnderstanding, whiche so rashly presumed too wander in this endles Laberinth. Such I esteeme you, and thereby am become such, and euen HE. F.I. This letter finished and fayre written ouer, his chaunce was to meete hir alone in a Gallery of the same house: (where his manhood in this kinde of combat was firste tried:) and therein I can compare him to a valiant Prince, who distressed with power of enemies had committed the safegard of his person to treaty of Ambassade, and sodenly (surprised with a Camassado in his owne trenches) was enforced to yeeld as prisoner. Euen so Ferdinando Ieronimi lately ouercome by the beautifull beames of this Dame Elynor , and hauing now committed his moste secrete intent to these late rehearsed letters, was at vnwares encountred with his friendly foe, and constrayned either to prepare some new defence, or else like a recreant to yeeld himselfe as already vanquished. Wherefore (as in a traunce) he lifted vp his dazled eies, and so continued in a certen kind of admiration, not vnlike the Astronomer, who (hauing after a whole nights trauaile, in the grey morning found his desired starre) hath fired his hungry eies to behold the Comete long looked for: whereat this gracious Dame (as one that could discerne the sunne before hir chamber windowes were wide ope) did deign to embolden the fainting Knight with these or like woordes. I perceiue nowe (quod she) howe mishap doth follow me, that hauing chosen this walke for a simple solace, I am here disquieted by the man that meaneth my destruction: and therwithall, as half angry, began to turne hir backe, when Ferdinando (now awaked) gan thus salute hir. Mistresse (quod he) and I perceiue now, that good hap hauts me, for being by lacke of oportunitie constreined to commit my welfare vnto these blabbing leaues of bewraying paper (shewing that in his had) I am here recomforted with happy view of my desired ioy: and therewithall reuerently kissing his hand, did softly distreyne hir slender arme, and so stayed hir departure. The firste blow thus profered and defended, they walked and talked trauersing diuerse wayes, wherein I doubte not but that the Venetian coulde quite himselfe resonably well. For after long talke shee was contented to accept his proffered seruice, but yet still disabling hir selfe, and seeming to maruell what cause had moued him to subiect his libertie so wilfully, or at least in a prison (as shee termed it) so vnworthy. Wherevnto I neede not rehearse his answere, but suppose now, that thus they departed: sauing I had forgotten this: shee required of him the last rehearsed letter, saying that his firste was loste, and nowe shee lacked a new bottome for hir silke, the whiche I warrant you, he graunted: and so proffering to take an hummble cong e by Bezo las manos , she graciously gaue him the zuccado dez labros: and so for then departed. And there vppon recompting hir woordes, he compiled these following, whiche he termed Terza sequenza , too sweete Mistresse SHE .  What reason first persuades the foolish Fly (As soone as shee a candle can discerne) To play with flame, till shee bee burnt thereby? Or what may moue the Mouse to byte the bayte Which strikes the trappe, that stops hir hungry breth? What calles the bird, where snares of deepe deceit Are closely coucht to draw hir to hir death? Consider well, what is the cause of this, And though percase thou wilt not so confesse, Yet deepe desire, to gayne a heauenly blisse, May drowne the minde in dole and darke distresse: Oft is it seene (whereat my hart may bleede) Fooles play so long till they be caught in deede. And then It is a heauen to see them hop and skip, And seeke all shiftes to shake their shackles off: It is a world, to see them hang the lip, Who (earst) at loue, were wont to skorne and skoff. But as the Mouse, once caught in crafty trap, May bounce and beate against the boorden wall, Till shee haue brought hir head in such mishap, That downe to death hir fainting lymbes must fall: And as the Flie once singed in the flame, Cannot commaund hir wings to waue away: But by the heele, shee hangeth in the same Till cruell death hir hasty iourney stay: So they that seeke to breake the linkes of loue Striue with the streame, and this by paine I proue. For when I first beheld that heauenly hewe of thine, Thy stately stature, and thy comly grace, I must confesse these dazled eies of mine Did wincke for feare, when I first viewd thy face: But bold desire did open them againe, And had mee looke till I had lookt to long, I pitied them that did procure my paine, And lou'd the lookes that wrought me all the wrong: And as the byrd once caught (but woorks hir woe) That striues to leaue the limed twigges behind: Euen so the more I straue to parte thee fro, The greater grief did growe within my minde: Remedilesse then must I yeeld to thee, And craue no more, thy seruaunt but to bee. Till then and euer. HE. F.I.  When he had well sorted this sequence, he sought oportunitie to leaue it where shee might finde it before it were lost. And nowe the coles began to kindle, whereof (but ere while) shee feigned hir selfe altogither ignorant. The flames began to breake out on euery side: and she to quench them, shut vp hir selfe in hir chamber solitarily. But as the smithie gathers greater heate by casting on of water, euen so the more she absented hir self from company, the fresher was the griefe whiche galded hir remembrance: so that at laste the report was spredde thorough the house, that Mistresse Elinor was sicke. At which newes Ferdinando tooke small comfort: neuerthelesse Dame Venus with good aspect did yet thus much furder his enterprise. The Dame (whether it were by sodaine chaunge, or of wonted custome) fell one day into a greate bleeding at the nose. For whiche accident the sayde Venetian , amongst other pretie conceits, had a present remedie: Whereby he tooke occasion (when they of the house had all in vayne sought many waies to stoppe hir bleeding) to worke his feate in this wise: Firste he pleaded ignorance, as though he knewe not hir name, and therefore demaunded the same of Mistresse Fraunces , who when shee had to him declared that hir name was Elinor , hee sayde these woordes or very like in effect: If I thought I shoulde not offend Mistres Elynor , I woulde not doubte to stoppe hir bleeding, without eyther payne or difficultie. This Gentlewoman somewhat tickled with his woordes, did incontinent make relation thereof to the sayde Mistresse Elynor : who immediately (declaring that Ferdinando was hir late receyued seruaunt) returned the saide messanger vnto him with especiall charge, that hee shoulde employ his deuoyre towardes the recouery of hir health: with whome the same Ferdinando repayred to the chamber of his desired: and finding hir set in a chayre, leaning on the one side ouer a Siluer bason: After his due reuerence, hee layde his hande on hir Temples, and priuily rounding hir in hir eare, desired hir to commaunde a Hazell sticke and a knyfe: the whiche beyng brought, hee deliuered vnto hir, saying on this wise. Mistresse I will speake certaine woordes in secrete to my selfe, and doe require no more: but when you heare me saie openly this woorde Amen , that you with this knyfe will make a nicke vppon this Hazell sticke: and when you haue made fiue nickes, commaunde mee also to cease. The Dame partly of good will to the Knight, and partly to be stenched of hir bleeding, commaunded hir mayde, and required the other Gentils, somewhat to stande aside: whiche done, he began his Oraisons, wherein he had not long muttered before he pronounced Amen , wherwith the Lady made a nicke on the sticke with hir knyfe. The saide Ferdinando continued to an other Amen , when ye Lady hauing made an other nick, felt hir bleeding began to steynch:  & so by the third Amen throughly steinched. Ferdinando then chaunging his prayers into priuat talk, said softly vnto hir: Mystres, I am glad that I am hereby enabled to doe you some seruice, and as the staunching of your owne bloud may some way recomfort you, so if the shedding of my bloud may any way content you, I beseech you comaund it, for it shalbe euermore readily employed in your seruice: and therwithal with a loud voyce pronounced Amen : wherewith the good Lady making a nick, did secretly answere thus: Good seruant (quod shee) I must needes think my selfe right happy to haue gained your seruice and good will, and be you sure, that although ther be in me no such desert as may draw you into this depth of affection: yet such as I am, I shalbe alwayes glad to shewe my self thankfull vnto you. And now, if you thinke your self assured that I shall bleede no more, doe then pronounce your fifth Amen : the which pronounced, shee made also hir fifth nicke, and held vp hir head, calling the company vnto hir, and declaring vnto them, that hir bleeding was throughly steinched. And Ferdinando tarying a while in the chamber, found oportunitie to loose his sequence neere too his desired Mistres: And after cong e taken, departed. After whose departure the Lady arose out of hir chayre, and hir mayd going about to remoue the same, espied, and toke vp the writing: the which hir mistres perceiuing, gan sodenly coniecture that the same had in it some like matter to the verses once before left in like maner, and made semblant to mistrust that the same should be some wordes of coniuration: and taking it from hir mayd, did peruse it, and immediatly said too the company, that she would not forgo the same for a great treasure. But to be plain, I think that ( Ferdinando excepted) she was glad to be rid of all company, vntill she had with sufficient leasure turned ouer and retossed euery card in this sequence. And not long after being now tickled thorough all the vaines with an vnknown humour, aduentured of hir selfe to commit vnto a like Ambassadour the discyphring of that which hitherto shee had kept more secret: and therevpon wrot with hir own hand and head in this wyse. great comfort by your meanes in the steinching of my bloud, and I take great comfort too reade your letters and I haue found in my chamber diuers songs which I think too be of your making, and I promise you, they are excellently made: and I assure you that I wilbee ready to doe for you any pleasure that I can, during my life: wherefore I pray you come to my chamber once in a day, till I come abroad again, and I wilbe glad of your company: and for because that you haue promised to be my HE: I will take vpon me this name, your SHE. This letter was doubtles of hir own hande writing: and as therin the Reader may finde great difference of Style, from hir former letter, so may you now vnderstand the cause. Shee had in the same house a friend, a seruant, a Secretary: what should I name him? such one as shee esteemed in time past more than was cause in tyme present. And to make my tale good, I will (by the same words that Bartello vseth) discribe him vnto you. He was in heigth the proportion of two Pigmeis , in bredth the thicknesse of two bacon hogges, of presumption a Gyant, of power a Gnatte, Apishly wytted, Knauishly mannered, and crabbedly fauord. What was there in him then to drawe a fayre Ladies liking? Marry sir euen all in all, a well lyned pursse, wherewith he could at euery call, prouide suche pretie conceytes as pleased hir peeuish fantasie: and by that meanes hee had throughly (long before) insinuated him selfe with this amorous dame. This manling, this minion, this slaue, this secretary, was nowe by occasion rydden too Florence forsothe: and though his absenee were vnto hir a disfurnishing of eloquence: it was yet vntoo Ferdinando Ieromini an opportunitie of good aduauntage: for when hee perceiued the change of hir stile, and thereby grewe in some suspition that the same proceeded by absence of hir chiefe Chauncellor, he thought good now to smyte while the yron was hotte, and to lend his Mistresse suche a penne in hir Secretaries absence, as hee should neuer be able (at his returne) to amend the well writing therof. Wherfore according to hir comaund he repayred once euery day to hir chamber, at the least whereas hee guided himselfe so wel, and could deuise such store of sundry pleasures and pastymes, that he grew in fauour not onely with his desired, but also with the rest of the gentlewomen. And one day passing the time amongst them, their playe grew to this end, that this Mistresse, being Queene, demaunded of him these three questions. Seruant (quod she) I charge you, as well vppon your [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) allgiance being nowe my subiect, as also vpon your fidelitie, hauing vowed your seruice vnto me, that you aunswere me these three questions, by the very truth of your secret thought. First, what thing in this vniuersall world doth most reioyce and comfort you? Ferdinando Ieronimi abasing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good aduisement in his aunswere, when a fayre gentlewoman of the company clapped him on the shoulder, saying, how now sir, is your hand on your halfpeny? To whome he aunswered, no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet my hart is not in myne owne hands: wherewithall abashed, turning towards dame Elinor he sayde: My souereigne and Mistresse, according to the charge of your command, and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue shall bewraye vnto you the truthe of mine intent. At this present a rewarde giuen me without desert, doth so reioyce mee with continuall remembraunce, that though my minde be so occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor night I can bee quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and pleasure whiche I conceiue in the same is such, that I can neyther be cloyed with continuaunce thereof, nor yet afraide, that any mishappe can counteruayle so greate a treasure. This is to me suche a heauen to dwell in, as that I feede by day, and repose by night vppon the freshe recorde of this reward. This (as Bartello sayeth) he ment by the kisse that she lent him in the Gallery, and by the profession of hir laste letters and woordes, Well, though this aunswere bee somewhat mistie, yet let his excuse be: that taken vppon the sodaine, he thought better to aunswere darkly, than to be mistrusted openly. Hir second question was, what thing in this life did moste greeue his harte, and disquiet his minde, whervnto he answered. That although his late rehersed ioy were incomparable, yet the greatest enimie that disturbed the same, was the priuie worme of his owne giltie conscience, which accused him euermore with great vnworthinesse: and that this was his greatest griefe. The Lady biting vpon the bitte at his cunning answeres made vnto these two questions, ganne thus replie. Seruaunt, I had thought to haue touched you yet nearer with my thirde question, but I will refrayne to attempt your pacience: and nowe for my third demaund, aunswere me directly in what manner this passion doth handle you? and howe these contraries may hang together by any possibilitie of concorde? for your woordes are straunge. Ferdinando now rousing himselfe boldly, tooke occasion thus to handle his aunswere. Mistresse (quod he) my woordes in deede are straunge, but yet my passion is muche straunger: and thervpon this other day to contet mine owne fantasie I deuised a Sonet, which although it bee a peece of Cocklorels musicke, and suche as I might be ashamed to publish in this company, yet bicause my truth in this answere may the better appeare vnto you, I pray you vouchsafe to receiue the same in writing: and drawing a paper out of his pocket, presented it to hir, wherin was written this Sonet.  As neuer man but I led such a life. First burning loue doth wound my hart to death, And when death comes at call of inward griefe, Colde lingering hope doth feede my fainting breath Against my will, and yeeldes my wound reliefe: So that I liue, but yet my life is such, As death would neuer greue me halfe so much. No comfort then but only this I tast, To salue such sore, such hope will neuer want, And with such hope, such life will euer last, And with such life, such sorrowes are not skant. Oh straunge desire, O life with torments tost Through too much hope, mine onely hope is lost. Euen HE F. I.  This sonet was highly commended, and in my iudgement it deserueth no lesse. His dutie thus perfourmed, their pastimes ended, and at their departure for a watch worde hee couselled his Mistresse by little and little to walke abrode: saying, that the Gallery neare adioyning was so pleasaunt, as if he were halfe dead he thought that by walking therin hee might be halfe  & more reuiued. Think you so seruaunt (quod she?) and the last tyme that I walked there, I suppose I toke the cause of my malady: but by your aduise (for that you haue so clerkly steynched my bleeding) I will assay to walke there to morow. Mistres quod he, and in more ful accomplishment of my duetie towards you, and in sure hope that you will vse the same onelie to your owne priuate commoditie, I will there awaite vpon you, and betwene you and me wil teach you the ful order how to steynch the bleeding of any creature, wherby you shal be as cuning as my self. Gramercy good seruant, quod she, I thinke you lost the same in writing here yesterday, but I canot vnderstand it: & therfore to morrow (if I feele my self any thing ameded) I wil sende for you thither to enstruct me throughly: thus they departed. And at supper time, the Lord of Valasco finding fault yt his gestes stomacke serued him no better, began too accuse the grosnesse of his vyands, to whom one of the getlewomen which had passed ye afternoone in his company, answered. Nay sir, quod she, this gentleman hath a passion, the which once in a day at the least doth kill his appetite. Are you so well acquainted with the dispositio of his body (quod the Lord of ye house?) by his owne saying, quod she,  & not otherwise. Fayre ladie quod Ferdinado , you either mistoke me or ouerheard me the: for I told of a cofortable humor which so fed me with cotinuall remebrace of ioy, as that my stomack being ful therof doth desire in maner none other vittayles. Why sir, (quod the host,) do you the liue by loue? God forbid sir quod Ferdinando , for then my cheekes wold be much thinner tha they be: but there are diuers other greater causes of ioy, than the doubtful lots of loue: & for mine own part, to be playn, I canot loue, & I dare not hate. I would I thought so, quod the gentlewoman. And thus with prety nyppes, they passed ouer their supper: which ended, the Lord of the house required Ferdinando Ieronimi to daunce and passe the time with the gentlewomen, which he refused not to doe. But sodenly, before the musicke was well tuned, came out Dame Elynor in hir night attyre, and said to the Lord, yt (supposing the solitarinesse of hir chamber had encreased hir maladie) she came out for hir better recreatio to see them daunce. Well done daughter (quod the Lorde.) And I Mistres (quod Ferdinando ) would gladly bestowe the leading of you about this great chamber, to driue away ye faintnesse of your feuer. No good seruaunt, (quod the Lady,) but in my steede, I pray you daunce with this fayre Gentlewoman, pointing him too the Lady that had so taken him vp at supper. Ferdinando to auoyd mistrust, did agree too hir request without furder entreaty. The daunce begon, this Knight marched on with the Image of S. Frances in his hand, and S. Elynor in his hart. The violands at end of the pauion staied a whyle: in whiche time this Dame sayde to Ferdinando Ieronimi on this wise: I am right sory for you in two respects, although the familiarity haue hytherto had no great continuance betwene vs: and as I do lament your case, so doo I reioyce (for myne own contentation) that I shall now see a due triall of the experimet which I haue long desired. This sayd, she kept silence: When Ferdinando (somwhat astonied with hir straunge speech) thus answered: Mistresse although I cannot conceiue the meaning of your woordes yet by curtesie I am constrayned to yeelde you thankes for your good wil, the which appeareth no lesse in lamenting of mishappes, than in reioycing at good fortune. What experiment you meane to trie by mee, I knowe not, but I dare assure you, that my skill in experiments is very simple. Herewith the Instruments sounded a new Measure, and they passed forthwards, leauing to talke, vntill the noise ceassed: whiche done, the Gentlewoman replied. I am sory sir, that you did erewhile, denie loue and all his lawes, and that in so open audience. Not so (quod Ferdinando ) but as the woorde was roundly taken, so can I readely answere it by good reason. Well quod shee, howe if the hearers will admit no reasonable answere? My reasons yet bee neuerthelesse (quod he) in reasonable iudgement. Herewith shee smiled, and he cast a glance towards dame Elinor , (a)   [  (a) as who sayeth ] askances arte thou pleased? Againe the viols called them forthwardes, and againe at the ende of the braule sayde Ferdinando Ieronimi to this Gentlewoman: I pray you Mistres, and what may be the second cause of your sorow sustained in my behalfe? Nay soft (quod she) percase I haue not yet tolde you the first, but content your selfe, for the second cause you shall neuer know at my handes, vntill I see due triall of the experiment which I haue long desired. Why then (quod he) I can but wishe a present occasion to bring the same to effect, to the end that I might also vnderstand the mistery of your meaning. And so might you faile of your purpose (quod she) for I meane to be better assured of him that shal know the depth of mine intent in such a secrete, than I do suppose that any creature (one except) may be of you. Gentlewoman (quod he) you speake Greeke , the which I haue nowe forgotten, and mine instructers are to farre from mee at this present to expound your words. Or els to neare (quod she) and so smiling stayed hir talke, when the Musicke called them to another daunce. Whiche ended, Ferdinando halfe afrayd of false suspect, and more amazed at this straunge talke, gaue ouer, and bringing Mistresse, Fraunces to hir place, was thus saluted by his Mistresse. Seruaunt (quod shee) I had done you great wrong to haue daunced with you, consideringe that this gentlewoman and you had former occasion of so waighty conference. Mistresse sayd Ferdinando you had done mee great pleasure, for by our conference I haue but brought my braynes in a busie coniecture, I doubt not (sayd his Mistresse) but you wil end that busines easely. It is hard said he to ende the thing, whereof yet I haue founde no begininge. His Mistresse with chaunge of countenaunce kept silence whereat dame Fraunces reioycinge, cast out this bone to gnawe on. I perceyue (quod she) it is euill to halte before a Creple. Ferdinando perceyuing now that his Mistresse waxed angry, thought good on hir behalfe thus to aunswere: and it is euill to hop before them that runne for the Bell: his Mistresse replied, and it is euill to hange the Bell at their heeles which are alwayes running. The Lord of he Castle ouerhearing these proper quippes, rose out of his chaire, & comming towards Ferdinando required him to daunce a Gallyard. Sir sayd he I haue hitherto at your apoyntmet but walked about the house, now if you be desirous to see one tomble a turne or twayne, it is like ynough that I mighte prouoke you to laugh at mee, but in good fayth my dauncing dayes are almost done, and therfore sir (quod he) I pray you speake to them that are more nymble at trippinge on the toe. Whilest hee was thus saying dame Elynor had made hir Congey , and was now entring the doore of hir chamber when Ferdinando al amazed at hir sodeyne departure followed to take leaue of his Mistresse: but she more then angrie, refused to heare his good night, and entring hir chamber caused hir mayde to clappe to the doore. Ferdinando with heauie cheare returned to his company, and Mistresse Fraunces to toutch his sore with a corosiue, sayd to him softly in this wise. Sir you may now perceyue that this our countrie cannot allowe the French manner of dauncing, for they (as I haue heard tell) do more commonly daunce to talke, then entreate to daunce. Fardenando hoping to driue out one naile with another and thinking this a meane moste conuenient to suppresse all ielous supposes, tooke Mistresse Fraunces by the hand and with a heauy smile aunswered. Mistresse and I (because I haue seene the french maner of dauncing) will eftsonnes intreat you to daunce a Bargynet: what meane you by thys quod mistresse Fraunces . If it please you to followe (quod he) you shall see that I can iest without ioye, and laugh without lust, and calling the musitions, caused them softly to sounde the Tynternall, when he clearing his voyce did Alla Napolitana applie these verses following, vnto the measure.  And nature taught the waie to loue, how I might best begin: To please my wandring eie, in beauties tickle trade, To gaze on eache that passed by, a carelesse sporte I made. With sweete entising baite, I fisht for manie a dame, And warmed me by manie a fire, yet felt I not the flame: But when at last I spied, that face that pleasde me most, The coales were quicke, the woode was drie, & I began to tost. And smiling yet full oft, I haue behelde that face, VVhen in my hearte I might bewaile mine owne vnluckie case: And oft againe with lokes that might bewraie my griefe, I pleaded harde for iust rewarde, and sought to finde reliefe. VVhat will you more? so oft my gazing eies did seeke, To see the rose and Lillie striue vpon that liuelie cheeke: Till at the last I spied, and by good proofe I founde, That in that face was painted plaine, the pearcer of my wound Then (all to late) agast, I did my foote retire, And sought with secret sighes to quench my gredie skalding fire But lo, I did preuaile asmuche to guide my will, As he that seekes with halting heele, to hop against the hill. Or as the feeble sight, woulde searche the sunnie beame, Euen so I founde but labour lost, to striue against the streame. Then gan I thus resolue, since liking forced loue. Should I mislike my happie choice, before I did it proue? And since none other ioye I had but her to see, Soulde I retire my deepe desire? no no it would not bee: Though great the duetie were, that shee did well deserue, And I poore man, unworthie am so worthie a wight to serue. Yet hope my comfort staide, that she would haue regard, To my good will that nothing crau'd, but like for iust reward: I see the faucon gent sometime will take delight. To seeke the solace of hir wing, and dallie with a kite. The fairest VVoulf will choose the foulest for hir make, And, why? because he doth indure most sorrow for hir sake: Euen so had [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) like I hope, when dolefull daies were spent When wearie wordes were wasted well, to open true entent. VVhen fluddes of flowing teares had washt my weeping eies, VVhen trembling tongue had troubled hir, with loud lamenting cries: At last hir worthy will would pittie this my plaint, And comfort me hir owne poore slaue, whom feare had made so faint. VVherefore I made a vowe, the stoany rocke should start, Ere I presume, to let her slippe out of my faithfull heart. And vvhen she savve by proofe, the pith of my good vvill, She tooke in vvorth this simple song, for vvant of better skill: And as my iust deserts, hir gentle hart did moue, She vvas content to ansvvere thus: I am content to loue: F. I.  By these verses he ment in clowdes to discipher vnto Mistresse Fraunces such matter as she wold snatch at, and yet could take no good hold of the same. Furthermore, it aunswered very aptly to the note whiche the musicke sounded, as the skilfull reader by due triall may approue. This singing daunce, or daunsing song ended, Mistresse Fraunces giuing due thanks, seemed weary also of the copany, and profering to departe, gaue yet this farewell to Ferdinando not vexed by choller, but pleased with contentation,  & called away by heauy sleepe: I am constreyned (quod she) to bid you good night, and so turning to the rest of the company, tooke hir leaue. Then the Maister of the house commaunded a torch to light Ferdinando to his lodging, where the sodaine chaunge of his Mistresse countenance, togither with the straungenesse of Mistresse Fraunces talke, made such an encounter in his mind, that he could take no reste that night: wherefore in the morning rising very earely (although it were farre before his Mistresse hower) he cooled his choller by walking in the Gallery neare to hir lodging, and there in this passion copiled these verses following.  And stormes of strife doo threaten to appeare: The waues of woo, which I mistrusted moste, Haue broke the bankes wherein my life lay cleere: Chippes of ill chaunce, are fallen amyd my choyce, To marre the mynd, that ment for to reioyce. Before I sought, I founde the hauen of hap, VVherin (once found) I sought to shrowd my ship, But lowring loue hath lifte me from hir lap, And crabbed lot beginnes to hang the lip: The proppes of darke mistrust do fall so thick, They pearce my coate, and touch my skin at quick. VVhat may be saide, where truth cannot preuaile? VVhat plea maie serue, where will it selfe is iudge? VVhat reason rules, where right and reason faile? Remedilesse then must the guiltlesse trudge: And seeke out care, to be the caruing knife, To cut the thred that lingreth such a life. F. I.  This is but a rough meeter, and reason, for it was deuised in great disquiet of minde, and written in rage, but to the matter. When he had long (and all in vaine) looked for the coming of his Mistresse into hir appoynted walke: he wandred into the Parke neere adioyning to the Castle wall, where his chaunce was to meete Mistres Fraunces , accompanied with one other Gentlewoman, by whome hee passed with a reuerence of curtesie: and so walking on, came into the side of a thicket, where he satte downe vnder a tree to allay his sadnesse with solitarines. Mystresse Fraunces , partely of curtesie and affection, and partly to content hir minde by continuance of such talke as they had commenced ouer night, entreated hir companion to goe with hir vnto this Tree of reformation, whereas they founde the Knight with hys armes foulded in a heauy kinde of contemplation, vnto whome Mistresse Fraunces stepped a pace (right softhlye) and at vnwares gaue this salutation. I little thought Syr Knight (quoth shee) by your Euensong yesternight, to haue founde you presentlye at suche a Morrow Masse, but I perceyue you serue your Saint with double deuotion: and I pray God graunt you trouble meede for youre true intent. He being taken thus vpon the sodaine, coulde none otherwise aunswere but thus: I toulde you mistres (quod hee) that I coulde laugh without lust, and iest without ioye: and therewithall starting vp, with a more bold countenaunce came towards the Dames, profferring vnto them his seruice, to waight vpon them homewardes. I haue hearde saye ofte times (quod Mistresse Fraunces ) that it is harde to serue two Maysters at one time, but we wyll be ryght glad of your company. I thanke you (quod hee) and so walking on with them, fell into sundrye discourses, still refusing to touche any part of theyr formor communication, vntill Mystresse Fraunces sayde vnto him: by my troth (quod shee) I woulde bee your debtour these two daies, to aunswere me truely but vnto one question that I will propound: fayre Gentlewoman (quod he) you shall not neede to become my debtour, but if it please, you to quit question by question, I will bee more readye to gratifie you in this request, then eyther reason requireth, or than you woulde be willing to worke my contentation. Maister Fardinando Ieronomij (quod she,  & that sadly) peraduenture you know but a litle how willing I would be to procure your [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) contation, but you know that hitherto familliarytie hath taken, no deepe roote beetwixt vs twaine. And though I finde in you no manner of cause whereby I might doubt to commit this or greater matter vnto you, yet haue I stayed hitherto so to doe, in doubt least you might thereby iustlie condemne me both of arrogancy and lacke of discretio, wherwith I must yet foolishlye affirme, that I haue with great paine brydeled my tongue from disclosing the same vnto you. Suche is then the good will that I beare towardes you, the which if you rather iudge to be impudencie, then a friendely meaning, I may then curse the hower that I first concluded thus to deale with you: herewithall beeing nowe redde for chaste bashefulnesse, shee abased hir eies, and staied hir taulke: to whome Fardinando thus aunswered. Mystresse Fraunces , if I shoulde with so exceeding villanye requight suche and so exceeding great courtesye, I might not onelye seeme to digenerate from all gentrye, but also to differre in behauiour from all the reste of my lyfe spent: wherfore to be playne with you in fewe wordes I thinke my selfe so muche bounde vnto you for diuers respects, as if abilitie doe not fayle me, you shall finde mee mindefull in requitall of the same, and for disclosing your mind to me, you may if so if please you aduenture it without aduenture, for by this Sunne quod he, I will not deceyue such trust as you shall laye vppon mee, and furthermore so farre foorth as I may, I will be yours in any respect: wherfore I beseech you accept me for your faithfull friend, and so shall you surely finde me. Not so, quod shee, but you shalbe my Trust , if you vouchsafe the name, and I wilbe to you as you shall please to tearme me: my Hope (quod hee) if you be so pleased: and thus agreed, they two walked a parte from the other Gentlewoman, and fell into sad talke, wherein Mistresse Fraunces dyd verye curteousely declare vnto him, that in deede, one cause of hir sorrow sustained in his behalfe, was that he had sayde so openly ouer night, that hee coulde not loue, for she perceyued verye well the affection betweene him and Madame Elynor , and shee was also aduertised that Dame Elynor stoode in the portall of hir chamber, harkening to the talke that they hadde at supper that night, wherefore she seemed to be sorry that such a worde (rashely escaped) might become great hinderaunce vnto his desire: but a greater cause of hir griefe was (as shee declared) that his happe was to bestow his liking so vnworthylye, for shee seemed to accuse Dame Elinor , for the most vnconstant woman liuing: In full proofe whereof, she bewrayed vnto him, how she the same Dame Elynor , had long time bene yelded to the Minion Secretary , whom I haue befor described: in whome though there be (quod she) no one poynt of woorthinesse, yet shameth she not to vse him as hir dearest friend, or rather hir holiest Idoll and that this not withstanding Dame Elynor had bene also sundry tymes woone to choyce of chaunge, as she named vnto Ferdinando two Gentlemen wherof the one was named Hercule Donaty : and the other Haniball de Cosmis . by whom she was during sundrie times of their seuerall aboad in those countries, entreated to like courtisie, for these causes the Dame Fraunces seemed to mislike his choyce, and to lament that she doubted in processe of time to see him abused. The experiment she ment was this, for that she thought Ferdenando (I vse Bartelloes wordes) a man in euery respect very worthy to haue the seuerall vse of a more commodious common, she hopped now to see if his inclosure there of might be defensible against hir sayd Secretary, and such like. These thinges and diuers other of great importaunce, this courteouse Lady Fraunces dyd friendly disclose vnto hym, and further more; did both instruct and aduise him to proceede in his enterprise. Nowe to make my talke good, and least the Reader might bee drawen in a ielose suppose of this Lady Fraunces , I must let you vnderstand yt she was a virgin of rare chastity, singuler capacitie, notable modestie, & excelent beauty: and though Ferdenando Ieronimij had cast his affection on the other (being a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) mery woman) yet was there in their beauties no great difference: but in all other good giftes a wonderfull diuersitie, as much as might betwene constancie & [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) flattring fantasie, betwene womanly coutenaunce and girlish garishnes, betwene hot dissimulation & temperat fidelity. Now if any man wil curiously aske the question why he should chuse the one and leaue ye other, ouer & besides ye comon prouerbe ( So mani men so manie mindes ) thus may be answered we see by common experience, that the highest flying faucon, doth more comonly praye vpon the corn fed crow  & the simple shiftles doue, then on ye mounting kyte: & why? because the one is ouercome with lesse difficultye then that other. Thus much in defence of this Lady Fraunces , & to excuse the choyce of Ferdenando who thought himself now no lesse beholding to good fortune, to haue found such a trusty friend, then bounden to Dame Venus , to haue wonne such a Mistres. And to returne vnto my pretence, vnderstand you, that he (being now with these two fair Ladies come very neere the castle) grew in some ielouse doubt (as on his own behalf) whether he wer best to break copany or not. Whe his assured Hope , perceiuing the same, gan thus recofort him: good sir (quod she) if you trusted your trusty frieds, you should not neede thus cowardly to stad in dread of your friendly enimies. Well said in faith (quod Ferdinado )  & I must confesse, you were in my bosome before I wist: but yet I haue heard said often, that in Trust is treason. Wel spoke for your self quod his Hope . Ferdinando now remebring that he had but erewhile taken vpon him the name of hir Trust , came home per misericordiam , when his Hope entring the Castle gate, caught hold of his lap,  & half by force led him by the gallery vnto his Mistres chamber: wheras after a litle dissembling disdain, he was at last by the good helpe of his Hope , right thakfully receiued:  & for his Mistresse was now ready to dine, he was therfore for ye time arested there, & a supersedias sent into the great chamber vnto the Lord of the house, who expected his coming out of the parke. The dinner ended,  & he throughly contented both with welfare & welcome, they fell into sundry deuices of pastime: at last Ferdinando taking into his had a Lute that lay on his Mistresse bed, did vnto the note of the Uenetian galliard apply the Italian dittie written by the worthy Bradamant vnto ye noble Rugier , as Ariosto hath it. Rugier qual semper fui, &c. but his Mistres could not be quiet vntill she heard hym repeat the Tinternell which he vsed ouer night, the whiche he refused not at that ende, wherof his Mistres thinking how she [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) had shewed hir selfe to vse any further dissimulation, especially perceyuyng the toward enclination of hir seruants Hope , fel to flat and playne dealing & walked to the window, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) called hir seruaunt apart vnto hir, of whom she demaunded secretly and in sad earnest, who deuised this Tinternell ? My Fathers Sisters brothers sonne (quod he) His mistres laughing right hartely, demaunded yet a gain, by whome the same was figured: by a niece to an Aunt of yours, Mistres (quod he). Well then seruaunt quoth shee, I sweare vnto you by my Fathers Soule, yt my mothers youngest daughter, doth loue your fathers eldest sone aboue any creature liuing. Fardenando hereby recomforted gan thus replie. Mistres, though my fathers eldest son be far vnworthy of so noble a match, yet since it pleaseth hir so wel to except him, I would thus much say behind his bark, yt your mothers daughter hath done him some wrong: and wherein seruaunt (quod she) by my troth Mistres (quod he) it is not yet xx. houres, since with out touch of brest, she gaue him such a nip by the harte, as did altogether bereaue him his nightes rest with the bruse therof. Well seruaunt (quod she) content your selfe, for your sake, I will speake to hyr to prouyde hym a playster, the which I my selfe will applye to hys hurt: And to the ende it maye worke the better wyth hym. I will puruay a lodging for hym, wher hereafter he maye sleepe at more quiet. This sayd: the rosie hewe, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) disdained hir sikely chekes, and she returned to the copany, leauing Ferdinando rauished betwene hope and dread, as on that could neither coniecture the meaning of hir misticall wordes, nor assuredly trust vnto the knot of hyr sliding affectiones. When the Lady Fraunces , coming to him, demaunded, what dream you sir? Yea mary doe I fayre Lady (quod he). And what was your dream, sir (quod she?) I dreamt (quod he) that walking in a pleasaunt garden garnished with sundrye delights, my hap was to espie hanging in the ayre, a hope wherin I might well beholde the aspectes and face of the heauens, and calling to remembrance the day and hower of my natiuety. I did therby (accordyng to my small skil in Astronomy) trie the conclusion of mine aduentures. And what found you therin (quod Dame Fraunces ?) you awaked me out of my dreame (quod he) or ells peraduenture you should not haue knowen. I beleeue you well (quod the lady Fraunces ) and laughing at his quicke aunswere brought him by the hande vnto the rest of his company: where he taryed not long before his gracious Mystresse badde him to farewel, and to keepe his houre there againe when he should by hir be sommoned. Hereby hee passed the rest of that daye in hope awayting the happie tyme when his Mystresse shoulde sende for him. Supper time came, and passed ouer, and not long after came the handemayde of the Lady Elynor into the great chamber desiering him to repayre vnto their Mistresse, the which he willingly acomplished: and being nowe entred into hyr chamber, he might perceyue his Mystresse in hir nightes attyre, preparing hir selfe towards bed, to whome Fardinando sayde: Why how now mystresse? I hadde thought this night to haue seene you daunce (at least or at last) amongst vs? By my troth good Seruaunt (quoth shee) I aduentured so soone vnto the great Chamber yeasternyght, that I finde my selfe somewhat sickelye disposed, and therefore doe strayne courtesye (as you see) to goe the sooner to my bedde this night: but before I sleepe (quoth shee) I am to charge you with a matter of wayght, and taking him a parte from the rest, declared that (as that present night) shee woulde talke with him more at large in the gallery neere adioyning to hir chamber. Herevpon Ferdinando discreetely dissimuling his ioy, toke his leaue  & returned into the great chamber, where he had not long continued before the Lord of the Castell commaunded a torch to light him vnto his lodging, wheras he prepared himselfe and went to bed, commaunding his seruaunt also to go to his rest. And when he thought aswell his seruaunt, as the rest of the houshold to be safe, he arose againe, & taking his night gowne, did vnder the same conuey his naked sword, and so walked to the gallerie, where he founde his good Mistresse walkyng in hir night gowne and attending his comming. The Moone was nowe at the full, the skies cleare, and the weather temperate, by reason whereof he might the more playnely [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) had with the greater contentation behold his long desired ioyes: and spreading his armes abrode to embrace his louing Mistresse, hee sayde: oh my deare Lady when shall I be able with any deserte to counteruayle the least parte of this your bountifull goodnesse? The Dame (whether it were of feare in deede, or that the wylinesse of womanhoode had taught hir to couer hir conceites with some fine dissimulation) stert backe from the Knight, and shriching (but softly) sayd vnto him. Alas seruaunt what haue I deserued, that you come agaynst mee with naked sword as against an open enimie. Ferdinando perceyuing hir intent excused himselfe, declaryng that he brought the same for their defence, and not to offende hir in any wise. The Ladie beyng therewith somewhat apeased they began with more comfortable gesture to expell the dread of the sayd late affright, and sithence to become bolder of behauiour, more familiar in speeche, and moste kinde in accomplishing of common comfort. But why holde I so long discourse in describyng the ioyes whiche (for lacke of like experience) I cannot set out to the full? Well, remedie was there none, but dame Elynor muste returne) vnto hir chamber, and he muste also conuey himselfe (as closely as might be) into his chamber, the which was hard to do, the day being so farre sprong, and he hauing a large base court to passe ouer before he could recouer his staire foote dore. And though he were not much perceiued, yet the Lady Fraunces being no lesse desirous to see an issue of these interprises, then he was willing to couer them in secrecy, laid watch, & euen at the entring of his chamber doore, perceiued the poynt of his naked sworde glistring vnder the skyrt of his nyght gowne: whereat she smiled & sayd to hir selfe, this geare goeth well aboute. Well Ferdenando hauing now recouered his chamber he went to bede, there let him sleepe, as his mistrisse did on the otherside. Although the Lady Fraunces being throughly tickled now in al the vaynes, could not enioye such quiet rest, but arising toke another gentle woman of the house with hir, and walked into the parke to take the fresh ayre of the morning. They had not long walked there, but they returned, and thought Ferdenando Ieronimij had not yet slept sufficiently, for one which had so farre trauayled in the night past, yet they went in to his chamber to rayse him, and comming to his beds side, found him fast on slep. Allas quod that other gentle woman, it were pitye to awake him: euen so it were quod dame Fraunces , but wee wil take away som what of his, wherby he may perceiue that we were here, and loking about the chamber, hys naked sword presented it selfe to the handes of dame Fraunces , who tooke it with her, and softly shutting hys chamber dore agayne, went downe the stayres and recouered hir owne lodging, in good order and vnperceyued of any body, sauing only that other gentle woman which accompanied with hir. At the last Ferdenando awaked, and apparrelling hym selfe, walked out also to take the ayre, and being throughly recomforted aswell with remembraunce of his ioyes forepassed, as well with the pleasaunt hermony which the Brides made on euery side, and the fragrant smel of the redolent flowers and blossomes whiche budded on euery braunche: hee did in these delightes compyle these verses following called a mooneshyne banquete.  And dayneth not to leaue hir loftie place: But onely then, when Phoebus shewes his face. VVhich is her brother borne and lendes hir sight.) Disdaind not yet to do my Lady right: To proue that in such heauenly wightes as she, It fitteth best that right and reason be. For when she spied my Ladies golden raies, Into the cloudes, Hir head she shroudes, And shamed to shine where she hir beames displaies. Good reason yet, that to my simple skill, I should the name of Cynthia adore: By whose high helpe, I might beholde the more, My Ladies louely lookes at mine owne will, VVith deepe content, to gare, and gaze my fill: Of courtesie and not of darcke disdaine, Dame Cynthia disclosde my Lady plaine. Shee did but lende hir light (as for a lite) VVith friendely grace, To shew hir face, That else would shew and shine in hir dispight.

Amid the waues that walter in the west, I gan behold this louely Ladies face. whereon dame nature spent hir giftes of grace: And found therein no parching heat at all, But such bright hew, As might renew, An Aungels ioyes in raigne celestiall. The courteouse Moone that wisht to do me good, Did shine to shew my dame more perfectly, But when she sawe hir passing iollitie, The Moone for shame, did blush as red as bloud, And shrounke a side and kept hir hornes in hoode: So that now when Dame Cynthia was gone, I might enioye my Ladies lokes alone, Yet honoured still the Moone with true intent? VVho taught vs skill, To worke our will, And gaue vs place, till all the night was spent. F. I.  And now to returne to my tale, by that time, that hee returned out of the parke, it was dinner time, and at dynner they all met. I meane both dame Elynor , dame Fraunces  & Ferdenando I leaue to discribe that the Lady Fraunces was gorgiously attyered, and set forth with very braue apparell, and Madame Elynor onely in hir night gowne gyrt to hir, with a coyfe trymmed Alla Piedmonteze , on the whiche she ware a little [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) cape crossed ouer the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) crowe with two bandes of yellowe Sarcenet or Cipresse, in the middest whereof she had placed (of hir owne hand writing) in paper this worde, Contented . This attyre pleased hir then to vse, and could not haue displeased Mistresse Fraunces , had she not ben more priuy to the cause, then to the thing it selfe: at least the Lorde of the Castle, of ignnoraunce, and dame Fraunces , of great temporaunce, let it passe with out offence. At dinner, bicause the on was pleased with al former reconinges, and the other partye priuie to the accopt, there passed no word of taunt or grudged, but omnia bene . After dynner dame Elinor being no lesse desirous to haue Ferdinandos compani, then dame Frances was to take him in some prety trippe, they began to question how they might best passe the day, the Lady Elinor seemed desirous to kepe her chamber, but Mistresse Fraunces (for another purpose) seemed desirous to ride abroade, therby to take the open ayre, they greed to ride a mile or twayne for solace, and requested Ferdinando to accompany them, the which willingly graunted. Eche one parted from other, to prepare them selues  & nowe began the sport, for when he was booted, his horses sadled, and he ready to ride, he gan misse his Rapier, wherat al astonied he began to blame his man, but blame whom he would, found it could not be. At last the Ladies going towardes the horsebacke called for him in the base Court, and demaunded if he were readie: to whome hee aunswered. Madame, I am more than readie, and yet not so ready as I would be, and immediatly taking him selfe in trip, he thought best to vtter no more of his conceipt, but in hast more than good spede mounted his horse, & comming toward ye dames presented himselfe, turning, bounding, & taking vp his courser to the vttermost of his power in brauery: after suffering his horse to breath him selfe, he gan also allay his owne choller, & to the dames he sayd. Fayre Ladyes I am ready when it pleaseth you to ride where so you commaund. How ready so euer you be seruaunt, quod dame Elynor , it seemeth your horse is readier at your commaunde then at oures. If he bee at my commaund Mistresse (quod he) he shall be at yours. Gramercye good seruaunte (quod shee) but my meanyng is, that I feare he be to stirring for our copany. If he proue so mistres (quod he) I haue here a soberer palfray to serue you on. The Dames being mounted they rode forthwardes by the space of a mile or very neare, & Ferdinando (whether it were of his horses corage or his owne choller came not so neare them as they wished) at last the Lady Fraunces sayde vnto him, mayster Ieronomy you sayde that you had a sober horse, which if it be so, we would bee glad of your company but I beleue by your countenaunce your horse and you are agreed. Ferdinando alighting called his seruaunt, chaunged horses with him and ouer taking the Dames, sayd to Mistres Fraunces : And why doe you think fayre Lady that my horse and I are agreed? Because by your countenaunce (quod she) it seemeth your patience is stirred. In good faith, quod he, you haue gessed aright, but not with any of you. The we care the lesse seruaunt, quod Dame Elynor . By my troth Mistresse, quod he (looking wel about him that none might heare but they two) it is with my seruaunt, who hath lost my sword out of my chamber. Dame Elinor litle remembring the occasion, replied it is no matter seruaunt, quod she, you shall heare of it againe, I warrant you, and presently wee ryde in Gods peace, and I trust shall haue no neede of it: yet Mistres quod he, a weapo serueth both vses, aswell to defed, as to offend. Now my by troth, quod Dame Fraunces , I haue now my dreame, for I dreamt this night that I was in a pleasaunt medow alone, where I met with a tall Gentleman, apparrelled in a night gowne of silke, all embroadered about with a garde of naked swordes, and when he came towards me I seemed to be afrayd of him, but he recomforted me saying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for I vse this garment onely for mine owne defence: and in this sort went that warrelike God Mars , what time hee taught Dame Venus to make Vulcan a hammer of the new fashion. Notwithstanding these comfortable words, the fright of the dreame awaked me, and sithens vnto this hower I haue not slept at al. And what time of the night dreamt you this quod Fardinando ? In the grey morning about dawning of the day, but why aske you quod Dame Frances ? Ferdenando with a great sigh answered, because that dreames are to bee marked more at some hower of the night, then at some other? why are you so cunning at the interpretation of dreames seruaunt (quod the Ladye Elinor ?) not very conning Mistres quod he, but gesse like a young scholler. The Dames continued in these and like pleasaunt talkes: but Ieronomij coulde not be mery, as on that estemed the preseruation of his mistres honor, no lese then the obteyning of his owne delightes, and yet to auoyd further suspicion, he repressed his passions, as much as hee could. The Lady Elynor (more carelesse then consideratiue of hir owne case) pricking forwardes sayd softly to him, I had thought you had receiued small cause seruaunt to be thus dumpish, when I would be mery. Alas deere mistresse quod he, it is altogether for your sake, that I am pensife: Dame Fraunces of courtesie with drewe hir selfe and gaue them leaue, when as Ferdinado declared vnto his Mistres, that his sworde was taken out of his chamber, and that he dreaded much by the wordes of the Lady Fraunces , that she had some vnderstanding of the mater. Dame Elynor now calling to remembrance what had passed the same night, at the first was abashed, but immediatly (for these women be redily witted) chered hir seruaunt, and willed him to commit vnto hir the saluing of that sore. Thus they passed the rest of the way in pleasaunt talke with dame Fraunces , and so returned towards the Castle where Ieronimy suffered the two dames to go together, and he alone vnto his chamber to bewayle hys own misgouernment. But dame Elynor (whether it were according to olde custome, or by wilye pollycye) founde meane that nyght, that the sworde was conueyed out of Mistres Fraunces chamber, and brought vnto hirs: and after redeliuerye of it vnto hir seruaunt, she warned hym to be more wary from that time forthwardes: afterward when he grew more bold and better aquaynted with his Mistris disposition, hee aduentured one Frydaye in the morning to go vnto hir Chamber, and therevpon wrote as followeth: which he termed a Frydayes Breakefast.  VVhen she doth raigne, that mockt Uulcan the smith, And thought it meete to harbor in hir bower, Some gallant gest for hir, to dally with, That blessed houre, that blist and happie daye, I thought it meete, with hastie steppes to go: Vnto the lodge, wherin my Lady laye, To laugh for ioye, or else to weepe for woe. And lo, my Lady of hir wonted grace, First lent hir lippes to me (as for a kisse) And after that hir bodye to imbrace, VVherein dame nature wrought nothing amisse. VVhat followed next, gesse you that know the trade, For in this sort, myr Fydaies feast I made. F. I.  Many dayes passed these two louers with great delight, their affayres being no lesse politiquely gouerned, then happilye atchiued. And surelye it should seeme in sadde earnest, that hee did not onely loue hir, but was furthermore so rauished in extasies with continuall remembraunce of his delights, that he made an Idoll of hir in his inwarde conceyte. So seemeth it by this challenge to beautie, which he wrote in hir prayse and vppon hir name.  My Nell hath stolne thy finest stuffe, & left thee in the lash Thy market now is marde, thy gaines are gone god wot, Thou hast no ware, that maie compare, with this that I haue got As for thy painted pale, and wrinckles surfted vp: Are deare ynough for such as lust to drinke of euery cup: Thy bodies bolstred out, with bumbact and with bagges, Thy rowles, thy ruffes, thy, caules, thy coifes, thy Ierkins & thy Jagges. Thy curling, and thy cost, thy friesling, and thy fare, To court to court with al those iois, & there setforth such ware Before their hungrie eies, that gaze on euery gest, And choose the cheapest chaffaire still, to please their fancy best. But I whose stedfast eies, coulde neuer cast a glaunce, VVith wadring loke, amid the prese, to take my choise by chauce Haue wonne by due desert, a peece that hath no peere, And left the rest as refuse all, to serue the market there: There let him chuse that list, there catche the best who can: A painted blazing baite may serue, to choke a gazing man. But I haue slipt thy flower, that freshest is of hewe: I haue thy corne, goe sell thy chaffe, I list to seeke no new, The windowes of mine eies, are glaz'd with such delight, As eche new face seemes full of faultes, that blaseth in my sight: And not without iust cause, I can compare her so, Loe here my gloue I challenge him, that can, or dare say no. Let Theseus come with clubbe, or Paris bragge with brand, To proue how faire their Hellen was, that skourg'd the Grecia land: Let mighty Mars himselfe, come armed to the field: And vaunt dame Venus to defed, with helmet, speare, & shield. This hand that had good hap, my Hellen to embrace, Shal haue like lucke to [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) stil hir foes, & daut them with disgrace. And cause them to confesse by verdict and by othe, How farre hir louelie lookes do steine, the beauties of them both. And that my Hellen is more faire then Paris wife, And doth deserue more famous praise, then Venus for hir life. VVhich if I not perfourme, my life then let me leese, Or else be bound in chaines of change, to begge for beuties feese. F. I.  By this challenge I gesse, that eyther he was than in an extasie, or else, sure I am nowe in a lunacie, for it is a prowde challenge made to Beautie hir selfe, and all hir companions: and imagining that Beautie hauing a shoppe where she vttered hir wares of all sundry sortes, his Ladie had stollen the fynest away, leauing none hehind hir, but paynting, bolstring, forcing and such like, the whiche in his rage he iudgeth good inough to serue the Courte: and therevpon grewe a great quarrell. When these verses were by the negligence of his Mistresse dispersed into sundry handes, and so at last to the reading of a Courtier. Well Ferdinando had his desire, yf his. Mistresse lyked them, but as Bartello writeth, shee grewe in ielousie, that the same were not written by hir, because hir name was Elynor and not Hellen . And about this point haue been diuers and sundry opinions among the Venetians , for this  & diuers other of his most notable Poems, haue come to view of the world. And some haue attributed this praise vnto a Hellen , who deserued not so well as this dame Elynor shoulde seeme to deserue, and yet neuer a barrell of good herring betweene them both: But that other Hellen , because she was sayeth Bartello , of so base conditions, as may deserue no maner comendation in any honest iudgement, therefore he thinketh that he would neuer bestow verse of so meane a subiect. And yet some of his acquaintaunce knowing also that he was sometimes acquainted with Hellen , haue stoade in argument, that it was written by Hellen , & not by Elynor . Well mine aucthor affirmeth that it was written by this Dame Elynor , and that vnto hir he thus alledged, that he tooke it all for one name, or at least he neuer read of any Elynor suche matter as might sound worthy like commendation, for beautie. And in deede considering all circumstaunces of histories, and comparing also the time that suche reportes do spreade of his acquaintaunce with Hellen , it cannot be written lesse then sixe or seuen yeeres before he knewe Hellen : marrye peraduenture if there were any acquaintaunce betweene him and that Hellen afterwardes, he might adapt it to hir name, and so make it serue boath their turnes, as elder louers haue done before, and still doe, and wyll doe world without ende. Wel by whome he wrote it I know not, and to returne to the purpose, he sought more certainelye to please his Mistresse Elynor with this Sonet written in hir praise as followeth.  About their neckes to beautifie their name: But she (whome I doe serue) hir pearles doth beare, Close in hir mouth, and smiling shewe, the same. No wonder then, though eu'ry word she speakes, A Iewell seeme in iudgement of the wise, Since that hir sugred tongue the passage breakes, Betweene two rockes, bedeckt with pearles of price. Hir haire of golde, hir front of Iuory, (A bloody heart within so white a breast) Hir teeth of Pearle lippes Rubie, christall eye, Needes must I honour hir aboue the rest: Since she is fourmed of none other moulde, But Rubie, Christall, Iuory, Pearle, and Golde. Ferdinando Ieronimy.  Of this Sonet, were it not a lyttle to muche prayse (as the Italians do most commonly offend in the superlatiue) I could no more commend it: but I hope the party to whome it was dedicated: had rather it were much more, than any thing lesse. Wel, thus these twoo Louers passed many daies in exceeding contentation,  & more than speakable pleasures, in which time Ferdinando did compile very many verses according to sundrye occasions proffred, and they were for the most parte sauced with a taste of glory, as you know that in such cases a louer being charged with inexprimable ioyes, and therewith enioyned both by duety and discrecion to keepe the same couert, can by no meanes deuise a greater consolation, than to commit it into some cyphred wordes, and figured speaches, in verse, whereby he feeleth his heart halfe (or more than halfe) eased of swelling. For as sighes are some present ease to the pensiue minde, euen so we find by experience, that such secreete entercomoning of ioyes doeth encrease delight. I would not haue you conster my wordes to this effect, that I thinke a man cannot sufficientlye reioyce in the luckie lottes of loue, vnlesse he empart the same to others: God forbid that euer I should enter into such an herisie, for I haue alwayes bene of this opinion, that as to be fortunate in loue, is one of the most inward contentatione to mans mind of all earthly ioyes: euen so if hee do but once bewray ye same to any liuing creature, immediatly either dread of discouering doth bruse his brest with an intollerable burden, or els he leeseth the principall vertue which gaue effect to his gladnes, not vnlyke to a Poticares pot, which being filled with sweete oyntmentes or perfumes, doth retayne in it selfe some sent of the same, and being powred out doeth returne to the former state, hard, harsh, and of small sauour: So the mind being fraught with delightes, as long as it can kepe them secretly enclosed, may continually feede vpon the pleasaunt record thereof, as the wel wylling and readie horse byteth on the bridle, but hauing once disclosed them to any other, straight waye we loose the hidden treasure of the same, and are oppressed with sundry doubtfull opinions and dreadfull conceiptes. And yet for a man to record vnto him selfe in the inward contemplation of his mind, the often remembrance of his late receiued ioyes, doth as it were ease the hearte of burden, and ad vnto the mind a fresh supplie of delight, yea, and in vearse principally (as I conceyue) a man may best contriue his waye of comfort in him selfe. Therfore as I haue sayde Ferdinando swimming nowe in delightes did nothing but writ such verse as might acumilat his ioyes, to the extremitie of pleasure, the which for that purpose he kept from sight of ye world, as one more desirous to seme obscure & defectiue, than ouermuch to glory in his aduentures, especially for yt in the end his hap was as heauie, as hitherto he had ben fortunate. And here I wyll surcease to rehearse any more of his verses vntil I haue expressed how yt his ioyes being exalted to the highest degree began to bend towards declinatio. For now the vnhappy Secretary whom I haue before remebred, was returned from Florence , on whom Fardinando had no soner cast his eies, but immediatly he fell into a great passion of minde, which might be copared vnto a feauer. This fruit grew of the good instructions yt his Hope had planted in his mind, whereby I might take iust occasion to forwarn euery louer, how they suffer this venemous serpent ielousie to creepe into their conceipts: for surely, of al other diseases in loue, I suppose that to be vncurable, and would hold longer discourse therin, were it not yt both this tale  & the verses of Ferdinando him selfe hereafter to be recited, shalbe sufficiet to speake for me in this behalf. The louer (as I say vpon the sodain) was drouen into such a malladie, as no meate might nourishe his body, no delightes please his minde, no remembrance of ioyes forepassed content him, nor any hope of the lyke to come might recomfort him: hereat (some vnto whome I haue imparted this tale) haue take occasion to discomend his fainting heart, yet surely the cause inwardly & deeply considered, I cannot so lightly condempne him: for an old saying is, that euerye man can giue councell better than followe it: and needes must the conflicts of his thoughts be straunge: betweene the remembraunce of his forepassed pleasure, and the present sight of this monster, whom before (for lacke of like instruction) he had not so throughlye marked and beheld. Well, such was the griefe vnto him, that he became sickly and kept his chamber. The Ladies hauing receiued the newes thereof, gan al at once lament his misfortune, & of common consent agreed to visit him: they marched thither in good equipage, I warant you, and foud Ferdinando lying vpon his bed languishing, who they all saluted generally, and sought to recomfort: but especiallye his Mistresse, hauing in hir hand a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) braunce of wyllow, wherewith shee defended hir from the whot aire, gan thus say vnto him: Seruaunt (quod she) for that I suppose your mallady to proceede of none other cause but only slouthfulnesse, I haue brought this preaty rod to beate you a little: nothing doubting, but when you feele the smart of a twig or twayne, you will like a tractable yong scholler, pluck vp your quickned spirits, & cast this drowsinesse apart. Ferdinando with a great sigh answered: Alas good Mistres (quod he) if any like chastisement might quicke me, how much more might the presence of all you louely Dames recomfort my dulled mind? whome to behold, were sufficient to reuiue an eye now dazled with the dread of death: & that not onely for the heauenly aspects whiche you represent, but also much the more for your exceeding curtesie, in that you haue deigned to visit mee so vnworthie a seruaunt. But good Mistresse (quod he) as it were shame for me to confesse that euer my hart coulde yeelde for feare, so I assure you that my minde cannot be content to induce infirmitie by sluggishe conceyt: But in trueth Mistresse I am sicke (quod he,) and therewithall the trembling of his hart had sent vp suche throbbing into his throte, as that his voyce (now depriued of breath) commaunded the tong to be still. When Dame Elynor for compassion distilled into teares, and drew towardes the window, leauing the other Gentlewomen about his bed, who being no lesse sorye for his griefe, yet for that they were none of them so touched in their secrete thoughtes, they had bolder sprits and freeer speach to recomfort him, amongest the rest the Lady Fraunces , (who in deede loued him deepely, and could best coniecture the cause of his conceipts) sayd vnto him: Good Trust (quod shee) if any helpe of Phisick may cure your maladie, I would not haue you hurt your selfe with these doubts whiche you seeme to retayne: If choice of Diet may helpe, beholde vs here (your cookes) ready to minister all things needefull: if company may driue away your anoye, wee meane not to leaue you solitary, if griefe of mind because of your infirmitie, wee all here will offer our deuoyre to turne it into ioye: if mishap haue giuen you cause to feare or dreade any thing, remember Hope , which neuer fayleth to recomfort an afflicted minde. And good Trust (quod she) (distreining his hand right hartely) let this simple proofe of our poore good willes bee so excepted of you, as that it maye work therby the effect of our desires. Ferdinando (as on in a traunce) had marked very litle of hir curteouse talke,  & yet gaue hir thankes, and so held his peace whereat the Ladyes (being all amazed) there became a silence in the chamber on all sides. Dame Elynor fearing thereby that she might the more easely be espyed, and hauing nowe dryed vp hir teares, retourned to hir seruaunt, recomforting him by all possible meanes of common curtesie, promising that since in hir sicknes he had not only staunched hir bleding, but also by his gentle company and sundry deuices of honest pastime, had driuen a waye the pensiuenes of hir mind, she thought hir selfe bound with like willingnes to do hir best in any thing that might restore his health, & taking him by the hand said further. Good seruaunte, if thou beare in deed any true affection to thy poore Mistres, start vpon thy feet again, and let hir enioye thine accustomed seruice to hir cofort, for sure (quod she) I will neuer leaue to visite this chamber once in a daye, vntill I may haue thee downe with mee, Ferdinando hearyng the harty woordes of his Mistris, and perceiuyng the earnest maner of hir pronunciation, began to receyue vnspeakeable comfort in the same, and sayd: Mistris, your exceedyng courtesie were able to reuiue a man half dead, and to me it is bothe great comfort, and it doeth also glad my remebrance, with a continual smart of myne owne vnworthinesse: but as I woulde desire no longer life, than til I might be able to deserue some part of your bouty, so I wil endeuor my self to liue, were it but only vnto ye ende, yt I might merite some parte of your fauour with acceptable seruice, and requight some deale the courtesie of all these other fayre Ladies, who haue so farre (aboue my deserts) deigned to doe me good. Thus sayd, the Ladies taried not long before they were called to Euensong, when his Mistres taking his hand, kissed it saying: Farewel good seruaunt, and I praye thee suffer not the mallice of thy sickenesse to ouercome the gentlenesse of thy good hart. Fardinando rauished with ioy, suffered them all to departe, and was not able to pronounce one word. After their departure, he gan cast in his mind the exceeding curtesie vsed towardes him by them all, but aboue all other the bounty of his Mystresse: and therwithall tooke a sound & firme opinion, that it was not possible for hir to couterfeite so deepely (as in deede I beleeue that shee then did not) wherby he sodenly felt his hert greatly eased, and began in himselfe thus to reason. Was euer man of so wretched a heart? I am the most bounden to loue (quod he) of all them that euer [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) possessed his seruice, I enioy one the fayrest that euer was found, and I finde hir the kindest that euer was hearde of: yet in mine owne wicked heart, I coulde vilanously conceyue that of hir, which being compared with the rest of hir vertues, is not possible to harbour in so noble a mind. Herby I haue brought my self without cause into this feeblenesse: and good reason that for so high an offence, I should be punished with great infirmitie: what shall I then doe? yelde to the same? no, but according to my late protestation, I will recomfort this languishing minde of mine, to the ende I may liue but onely to do penaunce for this so notable a cryme so rashly committed: and thus saying, he start from his bed, and gan to walke towardes the window: but the venimous serpent which (as before I rehearsed) had stong him, coulde not be content that these medicines applyed by the mouth of his gentle Mistresse, should so soone restorte him to guerison. And although in dede they were such Nythrydate to him as that they had nowe expelled the rancour of the poyson yet that ougly hellishe monster had left behind hir in the most secret of his bosome, (euen betwene the minde and the man) one of hir familiers named suspect , whiche gan work in the weake spirites of Ferdinando efectes of no lese perill than before he had receiued, his head swelling with these troublsome toyes, and his hart swimming in the tempests of tossing fantasie: he felt his legges so feeble, that he was costrayned to lie down on his bed again, and repeating in his own remembraunce euery woorde that his mistres had spoken vnto him, he gan to dread, that she had brought the willow braunche to beate hym with, in token that he was of hir forsaken: for so louers do most commonly expound the willow garlande, and this to thinke, did cut his hart in twayne. A wonderfull chaunge: and here a little to staye you, I will discribe as I finde it in Bartello the beginning , the fall, the retourne, and the being of this hellish byrde, who in deede maye well bee counted a very lymbe of the Diuill. Many yeares since, one of the moste dreadfull dasterdes in the world, and one of them that first deuissed to weare his beard at length, lest the Barbor might doe him a good turne soner then he looked for it, and yet not so soone as he deserued, had builded for his security a pile on the hyghest and most inaccessible mount of all his Territores: the which being fortyfied with strong walles, and enuyroned with deepe ditches, had no place of entire, but one onely doore so strayght and narrow, as might by any possibility receiue the body of one liuing man: from which he asended vp a ladder, and so creeping through a meruelous strait hole, attayned to his lodging, yt which was so dark  & obscure, as scarcely either sunne or ayre could enter into it: thus hee deuised to lodge in safetie, and for the more suertye gane truste none other letting downe this ladder but only his wife: and at the foote therof kept alwaies by daye light, a fierce mastife close enkeneled which neuer sawe nor hearde the face or voice of any other creature but onelye of them twoo: him by night he trusted with the scout of this prety passage, hauing neuerthelesse between him & this dogge, a double doore with treble lockes, quadrible barres, and before all a port coulez of Iron: neither yet could he bee so hardye as to sleepe, vntyll he had caused a garde of seruauntes (whome he kept abroade for that purpose) to search all the corners adioyning to all his fortresse, and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) that betweene fearefull sweate and chyuering cold, with one eye opened & the other closed, he stole sometimes a broken sleepe, deuided with many terrible dreames. In this sort the wretch lyued all to long, vntyll at last his Wife being not able any longer to supporte this hellishe life, grewe so hardye, as with his owne knife to dispatche his carkas out of this earthlye purgatorye: the which being done, his soule (and good reason) was quickly conueyed by Carone vnto hell: there Radamanthus Iudge of that benche, commaunded him quicklye to be thrust into a boyling poole: and being therein plonged very often, hee neuer shryked or cryed, I skalde, as his other companions there cryed, but seemed so lightlye to esteeme it, that the Iudge thought meete to condempne him vnto the most terrible place, where are such tormentes, as neyther penne can wryte, tongue expresse, or thought conceyue: but the myser (euen there) seemed to smyle and to make small accompt of his punishment. Radamanthus hereof enformed, sent for him, and demaunded the cause why he made so light of his duraunce? he aunswered that whyles he lyued on earth, he was so continually afflicted and oppressed with suspicion, as that now (only to thinke that he was out of those meditations) was sufficient armour to defend him from all other tormentes. Radamanthus astonied hereat, gan call togeather the Senators of that kingdome, and propounded this question, howe  & by what punnishment they might deuise to touche him according to his deserts? & here vpon fell great disputation: at last being cosidered, that he had already him plonged in the most vnspeakable torments, & therat litle or nothing had changed coutenance, therewithal yt no soule was sent vnto the to be relieued of his smart, but rather to be punished for his former delights: it was cocluded by ye general cousel, yt he should be eftsones sent into ye world & restored to the same body wherein he first had his resiance, so to remain for perpetuity, and neuer to depart nor to perish. Thus this body and soule being once againe vnited, and nowe eftsones with the same pestilence infected, he became of a suspicious man, Suspicion it selfe: and now the wretch remembring the treason of his wife, who had so willingly dispatched him once before, gan vtterly abhorre hir, and fled hir company, searching in all countries some place of better assurance, and when he had in vaine trode ouer ye most part of the earth, he embarked himself to find some vnknowen Ilande, wherein he might frame some newe habitation: and finding none so commodious as hee desired, he fortuned (sayling aloane by the shoare) to espy arock, more than sixe hundreth Cubits high, which hong so suspiciously ouer the seas, as though it would threaten to fall at euerye litle blast: this dyd Suspition Imagine to be a fit foundation whereon he might build his second Bower: hee forsooke his boate, and trauailed by lande to espie what entrye or accesse might bee made vnto ye same, and founde from lande no maner of entrie or accesse, vnlesse it were that some curteouse Byrd of the ayre would be Ambassadour, or conuey some Engins, as whilom the Eagle did carrie Ganymedes into heauen. He then returned to Seas, and approching neere to this rocke, founde a small streame of fresh water issuing out of the same into the Seas: the whiche, although it were so lytle and so straight, as might vnethes receyue a boat of bygnesse to carry one liuing creature at once, yet in his conceypt hee thought it more large and spatious than that broad waye called of our forefathers Via appia , or than that other named [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Elaminia , he abandoned his barke, and putting of his clothes aduentured (for he was now asured not to drown) to wade and swim against the streame of this vnknown brooke, the which (a wondrous thing to tell, and skarcelye to be beleeued) came downe from the very top and height of this rock: and by the waye he found six strayghts & dangerous places, wher the water seemed to staye his course, passing vnder six strayght and lowe bridges, and harde by euery of those places, a pyle raysed vp in manner of a Bulworke, the which were hollow, in such sorte as lodginges and other places necessary might in them commodiously be deuised, by suche one as coulde endure the hellishnes of the place. Passing by these hee attayned wyth much payne vnto the toppe of the Rocke, the which hee found hollowed as the rest, and farre more fite for hys security, than otherwise apt for any commodity. Ther gan Suspition , determine to nestle hymselfe, and hauing now placed sixe chosen porters, to wit, ( Dread, Mistrust, Wrath, Desperation, Frensie, and Fury :) at these sixe straung Bulworkes, he lodged himselfe in that vii. al alone, for he trusted no company, but euer mistrusting that his wife should eftsonnes finde him out therein, hee shricketh comtynually lyke to a shrich owle to keepe the watch wakyng, neuer content to sleep by day nor by night. But to be sure that he should not ouer sleepe him selfe, gane stuffe hys couch with Porpentines quilles, to the ende that when heauy sleep ouercame him, and he thereby should be constrayned to charge his pallad with more heauye burden, those plumes might then pricke through and so awake him. His garments were steele vpon yron, and that yron vpon Iron, and Iron agayne, and the more he was armed, the lesse he trusted to be out of daunger. He chopped and changed continually now this, now that, now keyes, now lockes, ditches newe skowred, and walles newlye fortified, and thus alwaies vncontented liueth this wretched helbound Suspition , in this hellish dungion of habitation: from whence he neuer remoueth his foote, but onely in the dead  & silent nightes, when he maye be assured that all creatures (but him selfe) are whelmed in sound sleepe. And then with stealing steps he stalketh about the earth, enfecting, tormenting, & vexing all kindes of people with some part of his afflictions: but especiallye such as eyther doe sit in chayre of greatest dignity and estimation, or els such as haue atchiued some deere and rare emprise. Those aboue al others he continually gauleth with fresh wouds of dread, least they might lose and forgo the roomes whervnto with such long trauaile and good happes they had attained, and by this meanes percase he had crept into the bosom of Ferdinando , who (as is before declared) did earst swimme in the deepest seas of earthly delightes. Nowe then I must thinke it high time to retorne vnto him, who (being now through feeblenesse eftsones cast downe vpon his bed) gan cast in his inwarde meditations all thinges passed, and as one throughly puffed vp and filled with one peeuishe conceipte, coulde thinke vppon nothing else, and yet accusing his own guiltie conscience to be infected with ielosie, dyd compile this as followeth.  As to be tyed, in linkes of worthy loue? VVhat life so blist and happie might appeare, As for to serue Cupid that God aboue? If that our mindes were not sometimes infect, VVith dread, with feare, with care, with cold suspect: VVith deepe dispaire, with furious frenesie, Handmaides to her, whome we call ielosie. For eu'ry other sop of sower chaunce, VVhich louers tast amid their sweete delight: Encreaseth ioye, and doth their loue aduaunce, In pleasures place, to haue more perfect plight. The thirstie mouth thinkes water hath good taste, The hungrie iawes, are pleas'd, with eche repaste: VVho hath not prou'd what dearth by warres doth growe, Cannot of peace the pleasaunt plenties knowe.

(VVhen presence comes) doth turne from griefe to game, To serue without reward is thought great paine, But if dispaire do not therewith remaine, It may be borne for right rewardes at last, Followe true seruice, though they come not fast. Disdaines, repulses, finallie eche ill, Eche smart, eche paine, of loue eche bitter tast, To thinke on them gan frame the louers will, To like eche ioye, the more that comes at last: But this infernall plague if once it tutch, Or venome once the louers mind with grutch, All festes and ioyes that afterwardes befall, The louer comptes them light or nought at all. This is that sore, this is that poisoned wound, The which to heale, nor salue, nor ointmentes serue, Nor charme of wordes, nor Image can be founde, Nor obseruaunce of starres can it preserue, Nor all the art of Magicke can preuaile, VVhich [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Zoroactes found for our auaile, Oh cruell plague, aboue all sorrowes smart, VVith desperate death thou fleast the louers heart.

Of thy mad moodes, and of naught else I thinke, In such like seas, faire Bradamant did sincke Ferdinando. Ieronimy.  Thus Ferdinando continued on his bedde, vntyll hys bountifull Mistresse with the companye of the other courteous dames retorned after supper to his chamber. At their first entrie: Why how nowe seruaunt (quod dame Elinor ) wee hoped to haue founde you one foote? Mistresse quod he, I haue assayed my feete since your departure, but I finde them yet vnable too suport my heauy body, and therefore am constrayned as you see, to acquaint my selfe with these pillowes. Seruaunt sayde she I am right sory therof, but since it is of necessitie to beare sicknesse, I will employ my endeuoyre to allay some parte of your paynes, and to refreshe your weary limbes with some comfortable matter: and therewithall calling hir hande mayde, deliuered vnto hir a bounch of pretie littell keyes, and whispering in hir eare, dispatched hir towards hir chamber: The mayde taryed not long, but returned with a little Casket, the which hir mistresse toke, opened and drewe out of the same much fine linnen, amongst the which she toke a pillowebere very fine and sweete, which although it were of it selfe as sweete as might be (being of long time kept in that odoriferous chest) yet did she with damaske water and that of the best that might be (I warrant you) al to sprinkle it with hir owne handes, which in my conceipt might much amende the matter. Then calling for a fresh pillowe, sent hir mayde to ayre the same and at hir returne put on this, thus perfumed pillowebeere. In meane time also shee had with hir owne hands attyred hir seruaunts head in a fayre wrought kerchife taken out of the same Casket: then layde him downe vppon this freshe and pleasaunt place, and pretelye as it were in sporte, bedewed his temples with sweete water which she had readye in a casting bottle of Golde, kissing his cheeke and saying: Good seruaunt be whoale, for I might not long indure thus to attend thee, and yet the loue that I beare towardes thee, cannot be content to see thee languishe. Mistresse sayde Ferdinando (and that with a trembling voice) assure your selfe, that if there remain in me any sparke of life or possibillity of recouery, then may this excellent bounty of yours be sufficient to reuiue me without any further trauaile or paine vnto your person: for whome I am highlye to blame, in that I do not spare to put you vnto this trouble, & better it were that suche a wretch as I had died vnknown, than yt by your exceeding curtesie, you should fall into any malladye, eyther by resorting vnto me, or by these your paines taken about me. Seruaunt (quod shee) all pleasures seeme painefull to to them that take no delight therin, and lyke wise all toile seemeth pleasaunt to such as set their felicitie in the same: but for me bee you sure, I doe it with so good a wyll that I can take no hurt thereby, vnlesse I shall perceyue that it be reiected or neglected, as vnprofitable or vncomfortable vnto you. To me Mistresse quod Fardinando , it is suche pleasure, as neyther my feeble tongue can expresse, nor my troubled mind conceyue. Why? are you troubled in mind, the seruant quod dame Elynor ? Ferdinando now blushing answered, but euen as al sick men be Mistresse. Herewith they staied their talke a while, and the first that brake silence was the Ladye Fraunces : who sayde, and to driue away ye troubles of your mind good Trust , I would be glad if we coulde deuise some pastime amongst vs to keepe you company: for I remember that with such deuises you did greatly recomforte this fayre Lady when she languished in like sort. She languished in deede gentle Hope quod hee, but God forbide that she had languished in like sort. Euery body thinketh their own greif greatest qd dame Elynor , but in deede whether my greife were the more or the lesse, I am right sorye that yours is such as it is: And to assay whither our passions proceded of lyke cause or not, I would we could (according to this Ladyes saying) deuise some like pastimes to trie if your malladie would be cured with like medicines. A gentle woman of the company whom I haue not hetherto named, gan thus propound. We haue accustomed (quod she) heretofore in most of our games to chuse a King or Quene, and he or she during their gouernment, haue charged euery of vs, eyther with commaundementes or questions, as best seemed to their maiestie. Wherin (to speake mine opinion) we haue giuen ouer larg a skope, neither semeth it reasonable yt on should haue ye power to discouer ye thoughts, or at least to bridle the affects of al ye rest. And though in deed in questioning (which doth of ye twaine more nerely touch the mind) eueryon is at free liberty to answere what they list: yet oft haue I hearde a question demaunded in such sorte, and vpon such sodayne, yt it hath bene hardly answered without mouing matter of contencion. And in commaundes also, some times it happeneth one to bee commaunded vnto such seruice, as eyther they are vnfit to accomplish (and then the parties weaknes is therby detected) or els to doe something that they would not, wherof ensueth more grutch than game. Wherefore in mine opinion, we shall do well to chuse by lot amongst vs a gouernour, who (for that it shalbe sufficient preheminence to vse the chayre of maiestie,) shalbe boud to giue sentece vppon al suche arguments and questions as we shall orderly propound vnto them: and from him or her (as from an oracle (wee will receiue aunswere, and decyding of our lytigious causes. This dame had stuffe in her, an old courtier,  & a wylie wenche, named Pergo . Wel this proportio of Pergo pleased them well, and by lot it hapned that Ferdinando must be moderator of these matters, and colector of these causes. The which being so constituted, the Lady Elynor sayd vnto this dame Pergo . You haue deuised this pastime (quod she) & because we thinke you to be most expert in the handling therof, do you propound the first question, & we shalbe both the more ready and able to follow your example ye Lady Pergo refused not, but began on this wise. Noble gouernor (quod she) amongst the aduentures that haue befallen mee, I remember especially this one, that in youth it was my chaunce to bee beloued of a verye courtlike yong Gentleman, who abode neare the place wherin my parents had their resiaunce. This gentleman (whether it were for beauty, or for any other respect that he sawe in me, I knowe not) but he was enamored of me, & that with an exceeding vehement passion, & of such force were his effectes, that notwithstanding many repulses which he had receiued at my handes, he seemed daylye to grow in the renewing of his desires. I on the other side, although I could by no meanes mislike of him by any good reason (considering that he was of byrth no waye inferiour vnto mee, of possessions not to bee disdained, of parson right comelye, of behauiour Courtly, of manners modest, of mynde lyberall, and of vertuous disposition) yet suche was the gaitye of my minde, as that I coulde not bee content to lende him ouer large thonges of my loue: but alwayes daungerouslye behaued my selfe towardes him, and in suche sorte, as hee coulde neyther take comfort of myne aunsweres, nor yet once finde him selfe requited with one good looke for all his trauaile. This notwithstanding, the worthy Knight continewed his sute with no lesse vehement affection than earst hee had begonne it, euen by the space of seuen yeares, At the last, whether discomfited by my dealynges, or tryed by long trauayle, or that he hade parcase light vpon the lake that is in the forrest of Ardena , and so in haste and all thristie, had dronke some droppes of disdayne, whereby his hot flames were quenched, or that he had vndertaken to serue no longer, but his iust tearme of apprenticehode, or that the teeth of tyme had gnawen and tyred his dulled spirites in such sort, as that all beenummed hee was constrayned to vse some other artificyal balme for the quickning of his sences, or by what cause moued I knowe not he did not onely leaue his long continued sute, but (as I haue since perceiued) grew to hate me more deadly than before I had disdained him. At the first beginnyng of his retyre I perceiued not his hatred, but imagened that being ouer wearied, he had withdrawen himself for a time. And considering his worthines, ther withall his constancie of long time proued, I thoughe that I could not in the whole world find out a fitter match to bestowe my selfe, than one so worthy a person. Wherfore I [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) doe by al possible meanes procure that he might eftsones vse his accustomed repraye vnto my parentes: And further, in al places where I hapened to meete him, I vsed al the curtesies towardes him that might be contayned wythin the bondes of modestie. But al was in vaine, for he was now become more daungerous to be wone, than the haggard Faulcon. Our lottes being thus vnluckely chaunged, I grewe to burne in desire, and the more daungerous that he shewed him selfe vnto me, the more earnest I was by all meanes to procure his consent of loue. At the last I might perceiue that not only he disdayned me, but (as me thought (boyled in hatred against me. And the time that I thus continued tormented with these thoughts, was also iust the space of seuen yeares. Finally when I perceiued no remedye for my perplexityes, I assayed by absence to were away this malady, and therefore vtterly refused to come in his presence, yea or almost in any other company. Wherby I haue consumed in lost time the flower of my youth,  & am become as you see (what with yeares, and what with the tormenting passions of loue) pale, wane, and full of wrinkles. Neuerthelesse, I haue therby gayned thus much, that at last I haue wond my self cleere out of Cupids chaynes, and remayne carelesse at libertie. Now marke to what end I tell you this: first vii. yeares passed in the which I could neuer be content to yeld vnto his iust desires: next other vii. yeares I spent in seeking to recouer his lost loue: and sithens both those vii. yeares, there are euen now on saint Valentines day last, other vii. yeares passed, in the which (neither I haue desired to see him) nor he hath coueted to here of me. My parents now perceyuing how the crowes foot is crept vnder mine eye, and remembring the long sute that this gentelema had in youth spent on me, considering therewithall that grene youth is well mellowed in vs both, haue of late sought to perswade a marriage betwene vs, the which the Knighte hath not refused to here of, and I haue not disdayned to thinke on. By their mediation we haue bene eftsoones brought to Parlee , wherein ouer and be sides the ripping vp of many olde griefes, this hath bene cheifly rehearsed  & obiected betwene vs, what wrong and iniury eche of vs hath done to other. And here aboutes wee haue fallen to sharpe contencion. He alleadged, that much greater is the wrong which I haue done vnto him, than that repulse which hee hath sithenes vsed to me: and I haue affirmed the contrary. The matter yet hangeth in varyence. Now, of you worthy Gouernour I would be most glad to heare this question decided, remembring that there was no difference in the times betwene vs. And surely, vnles your iudgment helpe me, I am afrayde my marryage will bee marred, and I may go lead Apes in hell. Ferdenando aunswered, good Pergo , I am sory to heare so lamentable a discourse of your luckles loue, and much the soryer, in yt I muste needes giue sentence agaynst you. For surely great was the wrong that eyther of you haue done to other, and greater was the needelesse greife which causelesse eche of you hath conceyued in this long time, but greatest in my iudgment hath bene both the wrong and the greife of the Knight. In that notwithstanding his desertes (which your selfe confesse) he neuer enioyed any guerdone of loue at your handes. And you (as you alledge) did enioy his loue of long time to gether. So that by the reckoning, it wil fal out (although being [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) builded in your owne conceipt, you see it not) that of the one & twenty yeares you enioyed his loue vii. at the least, but that euer he enioyed yours wee cannot perceiue. And much greater is the wrong that rewardeth euill for good, than that which requireth tip for lap. Further, it semeth that where as you went about in time to trie him, you did altogither loose time which can neuer be recouered. And not only lost your owne time, whereof you would seeme nowe to lament, but also compelled him to lease his time, which he might (be it spoken with out offence to you) haue bestowed in some other worthy place, and therefore, as that greife is much greater which hath no kind of cofort to allay it, so much more is that wrong which altogether without cause is offered. And I (sayd Pergo ) must needes think, that much easier is it for them to endure grief which neuer tasted of ioye, and much lesse is that wrong which is so willingly proffered to be by recompence restored. For if this Knight wil confesse that he neuer had cause to reioyce in all the time of his seruice, then with better contentacion might he abyde greife than I, who hauing tasted of the delight which I did secretly coceiue of his desertes, do think ech grief apresent death by the remembrance of those for passed thoughts: & lesse wrong seemeth it to be destitut of ye thing which was neuer obtained, then to be depriued of a Iewel wherof we haue been already possessed, so that vnder your correction I might conclude, that greater hath beene my griefe and iniury susteined, than that of the Knight. To whome Ieronimy replied, as touching delight, it maye not be denied but that euery louer doth take delight in the inward contemplation of his mind, to think of the worthines of his beloued: & therefore you maie not alledge that the Knight had neuer cause to reioyce, vnlesse you will altogeather condemne your selfe of worthines. Mary if you will say that he tasted not the delightes that louers seeke, then marke, who was the cause but your selfe? And if you would accuse him of like ingratitude, for yt he disdained you in the later vij. yeeres (when as he might by accepting your loue, haue recopenced him selfe of all former wronges) you must remember therewithall, that the crueltie by you shewed towards him was such, that he could by no means perceiue that your change proceeded of good will, but rather eftsons to hold him enchained in vnknown linkes of subtile dealings, & therefore not without cause he doubted you: & yet without cause you reiected him. He had often sought occasion, but by your refusals he could neuer find him, you hauing occasion fast by ye foretop, did dally with him so long, tyl at the last he sliped his head from you, & then catching at the bald noddle, you foud your selfe the cause, & yet you would accuse another. To conclude, greater is the griefe that is susteined without desert, & much more is the wrog that is offered without cause. Thus Ferdinando Ieronimy decided the question propounded by Pergo , and expected that some other Dame should propound another? but his Mistresse (hauing hir hand on another halfpeny) gan thus say vnto him. Seruant this pastime is good, and such as I must nedes like of, to driue away your pensiue thoughtes: but sleeping time approcheth,  & I feare we disquiete you: wherefore the rest of this time we will (if so like you) bestowe in trimming vp your bed, and to morrow wee shal meete here and renewe this newe begon game with Madame Pargo . Mistresse (quod hee) I must obeye your wil, and most humbly thanke you of your great goodnesse, and all these Ladies for their curtesie. Euen so requiring you that you wyll no further trouble your selues about mee, but let my Seruaunt aloane with conducting mee to bed. Yes seruaunt (quod she) I wil see if you can sleepe any better in my sheetes: and therewith commaunded hir handmayde to fetche a payre of cleane sheetes, the which being brought (maruaylous fine and sweete) the Ladies Fraunces and Elinor dyd curteously vnfold them, aud layd them on the bed, which done, they also entreated him to vncloath him and go to bed, being layd, his Mistresse dressed and couched the cloathes about him, sithens moistened his temples with Rosewater, gaue him handkerchewes and other freshe linnen about him, in doing wherof, she whispered in his eare, saying: Seruaunt, this night I will bee with thee, and after with the rest of the Dames gaue him good night and departed, leauing him in a traunce between hope and dispayre, trust and mistrust. Thus he laye rauished, commaunding his seruaunt to goe to bed, and fayning that him selfe would assaye if he could sleepe. About ten or eleuen of the clocke came his mistresse in hir night gowne: who knowing all priuye wayes in that house verie perfectlye, had conueied her selfe into his chamber, vnseene and vnperceiued: and being nowe come vnto his beds side kneeled downe, and laying hir arme ouer him sayde these or lyke wordes: My good Seruaunt, if thou knewest what perplexities I suffer in beholding of thine infirmities, it might then suffice, eyther vtterlye to driue away the mallady, or much more to augment thy griefes: for I know thou louest me: and I think also that thou hast had sufficient proofe of myne vnfayned good wyll: in remembrance whereof, I fall into sundry passions: First, I compt the happy lotes of our first acquaintance, and therin I call to minde the equalitie of our affections, for I thinke that there were neuer two louers conioyned with freer concent on both partyes: and (if my ouer hasty deliuery of yeelding words be not wrested hereafter to my condempnation) I can then assure my self to escape for euer without desert of any reprofe. Here withall I cannot forget the sundry aduentures hapned since wee became one hart deuided in two bodyes, all which haue ben both happily atchiued, and delectable enioyed. What resteth then to consider but this thy present stat? The first corosiue that I haue felt, and the last cordiall that I looke for- the end of my ioyes, and the beginning of my torments. And here hir salt teares gan bath the dying lippes of hir seruaunt: who (hearing these wordes, and well considering hir demeanor) began now to accuse him selfe of such and so haynous treason, as that his gilty hart was constrayned to yeelde vnto a iust scourge for the same. He swooned vnder hir arme: the which when she perceiued, it were harde to tel what feares did most affright hir. And It were hard nowe to rehearse how he was reuyued, since there were none presente but hee dying, (who could not declare) and she liuing, who would not disclose so much as I meane to bewraye. For mine aucthor dreameth yt Ferdenando returning to life, the first thing which he felt, was yt his good mistres lay pressing his brest with the whole weight of hir bodye, & byting his lips with hir friendly teeth. And peraduenture she refrayned (either of curtesie towards him, or for womanish feare, to hurt her tender hande) to strike him on the cheekes in such sort, as they doe that striue to call againe a dying creature: and therefore thought this the aptest meane to reduce him vnto remembrance. Ferdinando now awaked, could no lesse doe, than of his curteous nature receiue his Mistresse into his bed: Who (as one that knewe that waye better, than how to help his swooning,) gan gently strip of hir clothes, and louingly embracing him, gan demaund of him in this sorte. Alas good Seruaunt (quod shee) what kinde of maladie is this that so extreemly doth torment thee? Ieronimij with fainting speach answered: Mistresse as for my maladie, it hath beene easelye cured by your bountifull medicines applied. But I must confesse, that in receiuing that guerison at your handes, I haue bene constrained to fall into an Extasie, through the gauling remembraunce of mine owne vnworthinesse? Neuerthelesse good Mistres, since I perceiue such fidelitye remayning betweene vs, as that fewe woordes wyll perswade suche trust as louers ought to imbrace, let these fewe wordes suffice to craue your pardon: and do eftsones powre vppon me (your vnworthy seruaunt) the aboundaunt waues of your accustomed clemencie, for I must confesse, that I haue so highlye offended you, as (but your goodnesse surpasse the mallice of my conceiptes) I must remayne (and that right woorthely) to the seuere punishment of my desertes: and so should you but loose him who hath cast away him self, and neither can accuse you, nor darre to excuse him selfe of the crime. Dame Elinor (who had rather haue founde hir seruaunt perfectly reuiued, than thus with straunge conceyptes encombred: and musing much at his darke spech, became importunat to know ye sertaynty of his thoughts. And Ferdenando as on not maister of him selfe, gan at the last playnly confesse how he had mistrusted the chaung of hir vowed affections: Yea and (that more was) he playnely expressed with whom, of whom, by whom, and too whom she bent hir better liking. Nowe, here I would demaunde of such as are experte: Is there any greater impedymente to the fruition of a Louers delights, than to be mistrusted? or rather, is it not the ready way to race all loue and former good will out of remembrance, to tell a guilty mind that you do mistrust it? It should seeme yes, by Dame Elynor , who began now to take the matter whotlye: and of such vehemencie were hir fancies, that she nowe fell into flat defiance with Ferdinando , who although he sought by many faire wordes to temper hir chollorike passions, and by yelding him selfe to get the conquest of an other, yet could he by no meanes determine the quarrell. The soft pillowes being present at al these whot speches, put forth them selues as mediators for a truce betwene these enemies, and desired that (if they would needes fight) it might be in their presence but one only blowe, & so from thence forth to become friendes againe for euer. But the Dame denied flatlye, alledging that shee found no cause at all to vse such curtesie vnto such a recreant: adding further many words of great reproche: the which dyd so enrage Ferdinando , as that hauing forgotten all former curtesies, he assayleth his enemies by force. At last she rose sodainlye and determined to saue hir selfe by flight, leauing him in bedde, with many despitefull wordes, and swearing that he shoulde neuer (eftsones) take her at the lyke aduauntage: the whiche oathe she kepte better than hir fourmer professed good wyll: and hauing nowe recouered her Chamber (because shee founde her hurt to be nothing daungerous) I doubte not, but shee slept quietlye the rest of the night. As Ferdinando also (perswading himselfe that he shoulde with conuenient leasure recouer her from this haggard conceipt) tooke some better rest towardes the morning, than hee had done in many nightes forepast. So let them both sleepe whiles I turne my penne vnto the before named Secretarie , who being (as I saye) come latelye from Florence , had made many proffers to renewe his accustomed consultations: but the sorrowe whiche his Mistresse had conceyued in Ieronimy his sicknesse togeather with hir continuall repayre to him during the same, had bene such lettes vnto his attempts, as it was long time before he could obtayne audience. At the last these newe accidentes fell so fauourably for the furtherance of his cause, that he came to his Mistresse presence and there pleaded for himselfe. Nowe, if I should at large write his alligations, togither with hir subtile aunsweres, I shoulde but comber your eares with vnpleasaunt rehearsall of feminine frayltye. To be short, the late disdayneful moode which she had coceiued against Ferdinado togither with a scrupule which lay in hir conscience, touching the xj. article of hir beleefe. moued hir presently with better will to consult with this Secretary , aswel vpon the speedy reuenge of his late receiued wrongs as also vpon the reformation of hir religion. And in verye deede, it fel out that the Secretary (hauing bene of long time absent,  & there his quiles and pens not worne so neere as they were wont to be,) did now [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) pricke faire large notes, that his mistres liked better to sing faburden vnder him, than to descant any longer vpon Ferdinandoes playne song, and thus they continued in good accord, vntill it fortuned that Dame Fraunces came into her chamber vpon such sodaine as she had like to haue marred all the musicke, well they conueyed their clifes as closely as they could, but yet not altogither without some suspicion giuen to the sayd dame Fraunces , who although she could haue bene cotent to take any paine in Ieronimies behalfe, yet otherwise she could neuer haue bestowed the watching about so worthelesse a pryse. After womanly salutations they fell into sundrye discourses, the Secretary stil abiding in the chamber with them. At last two or three other gentlewomen of the Castle came into Madam Elinores chamber, who after their Bon iour did all ( vna voce ) seeme to lament the sikenes of Ferdinando and called vppon the Dames Elynor and Fraunces , to goe visite him againe. The Lady Fraunces curteously consented, but Madame Elynor first alledged that she her selfe was also sickly, the which she attributed to hir late paynes taken about him and sayd, that onely for that cause she was constrayned to kepe hir bed longer than hir accustomed hower. The Dames (but specially the Lady Fraunces ) gan streight wayes coniecture some great cause of sodaine chauge, and so leauing dame Elinor , walked altogether into the parke to take the ayre in the morning: And as they thus walked it chauced that Dame Pergo heard a Cuckoe chaunt, who (because the pride of the spring was now past) cried Cuck cuck Cuckoe in hir stamering voyce. A ha (quod Pergo ) this foule byrd begines to flye the countrye, and yet before hir departure, see how spitfully she can deuyse to salute vs. Not so (quod Dame Fraunces ) but some other whom she hath espyed, wherewith Dame Pergo looking round about hir, and espying none other companie sayde. Why here is no body but we few women, qd she. Thanks be to God the house is not farre from vs (quod Dame Fraunces .) Here at the wylie Pergo partly perceyuing Dame Fraunces meaning, replyed on this sort: I vnderstand you not (quod she) but to leap out of this matter, shall wee goe visit Maister Ieronimy and see how he doth this morning. Why quod dame Fraunces , do you suppose that the Cuckoe called vnto him? Nay mary quod Pergo , for (as fare as I knowe) he is not maried. As who should say (quod Dame Fraunces ,) that the Cuckoe enuieth none but maryed folkes. I take it so, sayd Pergo , the Lady Frances answered. Yes sure I haue noated as euill lucke in loue (after the Cuckoes call) to haue hapned vnto diuers vnmaried folkes, as euer I did vnto the maryed, but I can be well content that we go vnto him, for I promised on ye behalfe of vs al, that we would vse our best deuoyre to recomfort him vntill he had recouered helth: and I do much meruayle that ye Lady Elinor is now become so vnwilling to take any trauayle in his behalfe, especially remembring that but yesternight she was so diligent to bring him to bed. But I perceiue that all earthly thinges are subiect vnto change. Euen so they be quod Pergo , for you maye behold the trees which but euen this other daye were clad in gladsome greene, and nowe their leaues begin to fade and change collour. Thus they passed talkeing and walking vntill they returned vnto the Castle, whereas they went strayght vnto Ferdinandoes chamber, and found him in bed. Why how now Trust (quod Dame Fraunces ,) will it be no better? Yes shortly I hope quod he. The Ladyes all saluted him: and he gaue them the gramercy: at the last Pergo popped this question vnto him: And howe haue you slept in your Mistres shetes Mayster Ieronemy quod she? reasonably well quod he, but I pray you where is my mistresse this morning? Mary sayd Pergo , we left hir in bed scarce well at ease. I am the more sorye quod he. Why Trust (sayd Mistresse Fraunces be of good comfort,  & assure your selfe that here are others who would be as glad of your wel doing, as your mistres in any respect. I ought not to doubt there of (quod Ferdinado ) hauing the prose that I haue had of your great courtesies, but I thought it my dutye to aske for my mistresse being absent. Thus they passed sometime with him vntill they were called awaye vnto prayers, and that being finished they went to dinner, where they met Dame Elynor attired in an night kerchiefe after the soolenest (the solempnest fashion I should haue said,) who loked very drowsely vpon all folkes, vnlesse it were hir secretary, vnto whom she deigned somtime to lend a frendly glaunce. The Lord of the Castle demaunded of hir how master Ieronemy did this morning. She answered that she knew not for she had not sene him that day. You may do wel then daughter quod the Lord) to go now vnto him, and to assay if he will eate any thing, and if here be no meates that like him, I praye you commaunde (for him) anye thing that is in my house, You must pardon me sir (quod she,) I am sickely disposed, and would be loth to take the ayre, why then go you mistres Fraunces (quod he) and take some body with you: and I charge you see that he lacke nothing. Mistres Fraunces was glad of the ambassege, and arysing from the table with one other [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) gentleman, tooke with hir a dish of chikins boiled in white broth, saying to hir father: I think this meat meetest for mayster Ieronimy . Of any that is here. It is so (quod he) daughter, and if he like not that, cause some what els to be dressed for him according to his apetite. Thus she departed and came to Ferdinando , who being plonged in sundry woes and thrilled with restlesse thoughtes, was nowe beginning to rise. But seing the Dames, couched down agayne, and sayd vnto them. Alas fayre Ladyes you put your selues to more paynes than eyther I do desire, or can deserue. Good Trust quod Dame Fraunces , our paynes are no greater than duty requireth, nor yet so great as we could vouchsafee in your behalfe. And presently my father hath sent vs vnto you (quod she) with this pittaunce, and if your apetite desire any on thing more than other, we are to desire likewise that you will not refrayne to call for it. Oh my good Hope (quod he) I perceiue that I shall not dye as long as you maye make me liue. And being nowe some deale recomforted with the remembraunce of his mistres words which she hadde vsed ouer night at hir first comming, and also thinkinge that although shee parted in choller, it was but iustlye prouoked by him selfe, and that at leasure hee shoulde finde some salue for that sore also) hee determined to take the comforte of his assured Hope , and so to expell all venomnes of mistrust before receiued. Wherfor raising him selfe in his bed, hee cast a night gowne about his shoulders saying: It shall neuer be sayd that my fainting hart can reiect the comfortable Cordialles of so freendly phisitions. Nowe by me troth well sayed gentle Trust quod Dame Fraunces , and in so doing, assure your selfe gueryson with speed. This thus sayed, the curteous Dame become his keruer,  & he wyth a bold spirite gan tast of hir cokerey. But the late conflicts of his conceipts had so disaquainted his stomack from repastes, that he could not wel a way with meate: and yet neuerthelesse by lyttle & little receyued some nouryture. When his Hope had crammed him as longe as she coulde make him feede, they delyuered the rest to the other gentlewoman who hauing not dyned, fell to hir prouender. In which meane while the Lady Fraunces had much comfortable speech with signor Ieronemy and declared yt shee perceiued very well the maladie. but my Trust (quod she) be all whole, and remember what I foretould you in the beginning: neuerthelesse you must thinke that there are remedies for all mischifes, and if you will be ruled by myne aduise, we will soone finde the meane to ease you of this mishap. Ferdinando tooke comforte in hir discrecion,  & freendly kissed hir hand, gaue hir a cartlode of thankes for hir greate good will, promising to put to his vttermost force, and euermore to be ruled by hyr aduice. Thus they passed the dinner while, the Lady Fraunces alwayes refusing to declare hir conceipt of the late chaung which she perceiued in his Mistresse, for she thought best first to wynne his wyll vnto conformitie, by little and little, and then in the ende to perswade him with necessitye. When the other gentlewoman had vytayled hir, they departed, requiring him to rise and boldly to resist the fayntenesse of his feuer. The which he promised and so bad them a Dio . The Ladyes at their retourne found the courte in Dame Elynores chamber, who had there assembled hir secretary, Dame Pergo  & the rest: ther they passed an hower or twayne in sundry discourses, wherein Dame Pergo did alwaies cast out some bone for mistresse Fraunces to gnaw vppon, for that in deede she perceyued hir harty affection towardes Ferdinando whereat Mistresse Fraunces chaunged no countenaunce, but reserued hir reuenge vntill a better oportunitie. At last (quod Dame Fraunces vnto Mistresse Elinor ) and when will you goe vnto your seruaunt fayre Lady? When he is sicke and I am whole, quod Dame Elinor . That is euen nowe quod the other, for howe sicke he is your selfe can witnesse: and howe well you are we must beare recorde. You maye as well be deceiued in my disposition (quod Dame Elinor , as I was ouerseene in his sodaine alteration: and if he be sicke, you are meete to be his phisition: for you sawe yesterday that my paines dyd lyttle profite towardes his recomfort. Yes surelye sayde the other, not onelye I but all the rest had occasion to iudge that your curtesie was his chiefe comfort. Well, quod Dame Elinor , you knowe not what I knowe. Nor you what I thinke quod Dame Fraunces . Thinke what you lyst quod Elinor . In deede quod Fraunces , I may not thinke that you care, neither wyll I dye for your displeasure: & so halfe angrie she departed. At supper they met againe, and the maister of the house demanded of his daughter Fraunces howe Fardinando did? Syr (quod she) he dyd eate some what at dyner, and sithens I sawe him not. The more to blame quod he, and now I would haue al you gentlewomen take of the best meates and goe suppe with him, for company driueth away carefulnesse, and leaue you me here with your leauinges alone. Naye syr quod Mistresse Elinor , I pray you giue me leaue to beare you company, for I dare not aduenture thither. The Lorde of the Castle was contented & dispatched awaye the rest: who taking with them such viandes as they thought meetest, went vnto Ieronimies chamber, fynding him vp, and walking about to recouer strength: whereat Dame Fraunces reioysed, and declared how her Father had sente that company to attend him at supper. Ferdinando gaue great thankes, & missing now nothing but his Mistresse, thought not good yet to aske for hir, but because he partly gessed the cause of hir absence, he contented himselfe, hoping that when his lure was newe garnished, he shoulde easely recleame hyr from those coy conceyptes. They passed ouer their supper all in quyete, and sone after Mistresse Fraunces , being desirous to requite Dame Pargoes [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) quibbes, requested that they might continue the pastime which Dame Pergo had begonne ouer night: whervnto they all consented, and the lot fell vnto Dame Fraunces to propounde the second question who adressing hir speche vnto Ferdinado said in this wise, Noble gouernor, I will reherse vnto you a strange historie, not fayned, neyther borowed out of any oulde aucthoritie, but a thing done in deed of late dayes, and not farre distant from this place where wee nowe remayne. It chaunced that a gentleman our neyghbour being maryed to a very fayre gentlewoman, liued with hir by the space of fower or fiue yeares in greate contentacion, trusting hir no lesse than he loued hir, and yet louing hir as much as any man could loue a woman. On that other side the gentlewoman had woonne (vnto hir beautie) a singular commendation for hir chast and modest behauiour. Yet it happened in time that a lustie young gentleman (who very often resorted to them) obtayned that at hir handes, which neuer any man coulde before him attaine: and to be plaine, he wonne so much in hir affections, that forgetting both hir owne duty, and hir husbandes kindnes, shee yeelded hir body at the commaundement of this louer, in which pastime they passed long tyme by theyr pollitycke gouernment. At last the frendes of this Lady (and especially three sisters which she had) espied ouermuch familliarity betwene the two louers, and dreading least it might breake out to their comon reproch toke their sister apart, and declared that the world did iudge scarce well of the repayre of that Gentleman vnto hyr house: and that if she did not foresee it in time, shee should not onely leese the good credite which she hir selfe had hitherto possessed, but furthermore should distaine theyr whole race with common obloquy  & reproche. These and sundry other Godly admonitions of those sisters, could not sink in the mind of this gentlewoman, for she dyd not only stand in defiaunce what any man could thinke of hir, but also seemed to accuse them, that (because they saw hir estimation (being their yonger) to grow aboue their owne) they had therefore deuised this meane to set variance betwene hir husbande and hir. The sisters seing their holesome counsell so reiected, and hir continue styll in hir obstinate opinion, adressed theyr speache vnto hir husbande, declaring that the worlde iudged not the best, neyther they themselues did very wel like of the familiaritie betwene their sister and that gentleman, and therfore aduised him to forecast all perils, and in time to forbid him his house. The husband (on the other side) had also conceiued suche a good opinion of his gest, & had growen into such a stricte familliaritie with him, yt you might with more ease haue remoued a stone wal, than once to make him think amis, eyther of his wyfe, or of hir louer. Yea, and immediatelie after this conference, he woulde not sticke thus to say vnto his wife. Lamia (for so in deede was hir name) thou hast three such busie brained sisters, as I thinke shortlye their heads wyll breake: they woulde haue me to bee iellous of thee, no no Lamia . &c. so that he was not onely far from any such beleefe, but furthermore dyd euerye daye increase his curtesies towards the louer. The sisters being thus on all sides reiected, and yet perceyuing more & more an vnseemelye behauiour betweene their sister and hir minion, began to melt in their owne grease: and such was theyr enraged pretence of reuenge, that they suborned diuers seruauntes in the house to watch so dilligentlye, as that this treason might de discouered. Amongst the rest, one mayde of subtile spirite had so long watched them, that at last she spied them go into the chamber together, and lockte the doore to them: wherevpon she ranne with all hast possible to hir Mayster, and toold him that if he would come with hir, she would shewe him a very straunge sighte. The gentleman (suspecting nothing) went with hir, vntill he came into a chamber neere vnto that wherein they had shut them selues. And she pointing hir mayster to the keyhole, bad him looke through, where he sawe the thing which moste mighte mislike him to behold. Where at he sodaynely drewe his Dagger, and turned towardes the mayde, who fled from him for feare of mischiefe. But when he could not ouertake hir in the heat of his coller, he commaunded that she should forth wyth trusse vp that little which she had, and to departe his seruice. And before hir departure, he found meanes to talke with hir, threatening that if euer she spake any worde of this mistery in any place where she should come, it should cost hir life. The mayde for feare departed in silence, and the Maister neuer changed coutenance to either his wife or to hir paramour, but fayned vnto his wife that he had turned a waye the mayde vpon that sodayne, for that shee had throwen a Kitchin knife at him, whiles he went about to correct a fault in hir &c. Thus the good gentleman dranke vp his owne swette vnseene euery day, encreasing curtesie to the louer, and neuer chaunging countenaunce to his wife in any thing, but onely that he refrayned to haue such knowledge of hir carnally, as he in tims past had, and other men haue of their wiues. In this sort he continued by the space all most of halfe a yeare, neuerthelesse lamenting his mishap in solytary places. At last (what moued him I know not) he fell a gayn to company with his wife as other men do and (as I haue heard it sayed) he vsed this pollicy. Euery time that he had knowledge of hir, he would leaue either in the bed, or in hir cusshencloth, or by hir looking glasse, or in some place where she must needes finde it, a piece of money which then was in Italie called a Caroline . Thus he dealt with her continuallye by the space of fowre or fiue monethes, vsing hir neuerthelesse very kindly in all other respects, and prouiding for hir all things necessary at the first call. But vnto his geast he still augmented his curtesie, in such sort, that you would haue thought them to be sworne brothers. All this notwithstanding his wife much musing at these smal peeres which she founde in this sort, and furthermore, hauing sundrye times found hir husband in solitarye places making great lamentation, shee grewe inquisitiue, what should be ye secreete cause of these alterations, vnto whom he would none otherwise answere, but yt any man should finde occatio to be more pensiue at one time than at another. The wife notwithstanding increasing hir suspect, imparted the same vnto hir louer, alledging therewithal that she doubted verye much least hir husband had some vehemet suspicion of their affaires. The louer encoraged hir, & likewise declared, that if she would be importunate to enquire the cause, hir husband would not be able to kepe it from hir: and hauing now throughly instructed hir, shee dealt with her husband in this sort. One day when shee knew him to be in his study alone, she came into him, and hauing fast locked the doore after hir, & conueyed the keye into hir pocket, she began first with earnest entreaty, and then with teares to craue that he woulde no longer keepe from hir the cause of his sodaine alteration. The husband dissimuled the matter still: at last she was so earnest to know for what cause he left money in such sort at sundry times: That he aunswered on this wise: Wyfe (quod hee) thou knowest howe long wee haue beene married togeather, and howe long I made so deare accompt of thee as euer man made of his Wife: since which dayes, thou knowest also howe long I refrained thy company, and howe long againe I haue vsed thy company, leauing the money in this sort, and the cause is this. So long as thou dyddest behaue thy selfe faithfullye towardes mee. I neuer lothed thy company: but sithens I haue perceiued thee to bee a harlotte, and therefore dyd I for a tyme refraine and forbeare to lye with thee, and nowe I can no longer forbeare it, I giue thee euery time that I lye with thee, a Caroline , which is to make thee vnderstande thine owne whordome: and this rewarde is sufficient for a whore. The wife beganne stoutlye to stand at defiaunce, but the husband cut of hir speach, and declared when, where, and how he had sene it: hereat the woman being abashed, and finding hir conscience guilty of asmuch as he had aledged, fell downe on hir knees, & with most bitter teares craued pardon, confessing hir offence: whereat hir husband (moued with pitie) & melting likewise in floods of lamentation, recomforted hir, promising that if from that day forwardes she would be true vnto him, he would not onely forgiue al that was past, but become more tender and louing vnto hir then euer he was. What doe I tarrye so long? they became of accord: and in full accomplishment thereof, the gentlewoman dyd altogeather eschewe the company, the speach, and (as much as in hir laye) the sight of hir louer: although hir husband dyd continue his curtesie towards him, and often charged his wife to make him fayre resemblaunt. The Louer was nowe onelye left in perplexitie, who knewe nothing what might be the cause of all these chaunges, and that most greeued him, he could by no meanes optaine againe the speach of his desired: he watched all opportunities, hee suborned messengers, hee wroote letters, but all in vaine. In the ende she caused to bee declared vnto him a time and place where she woulde meete him and speake with him. Being met, she put him in remembraunce of all that had passed betweene them: shee layde also before him howe trusty she had bene vnto him in all professions: she confessed also howe faithfullye he had discharged the duety of a friend in al respectes, and ther withall she declared that her late alteration and pensiuenesse of minde was not without great cause, for that she had of late such a mishap, as might chaunge the disposition of any lyuing creature: Yea, and that the case was such, as vnlesse she found present remedy, hir death must needes ensue, and that spedely, for the preuenting whereof, she alledged that she had beaten hir braines with al deuises possible, and that in the ende she could thinke of no redresse but one, the which lay only in him to acomplish. Wherfore she besought him for all the loue and good will which had euer passed betweene them, nowe to shewe the fruites of true friendship, and to gratifie hir with a free graunt to this request. The louer who had alwayes bene desirous to pleasure hir in any thing, but now especially to recouer hir wonted kindnesse, gan franklye promise to accomplishe any thing that might be to him possible, yea, though it were to his great detriment, and therewithall, dyd deepely blame hir in that shee would so long torment hir selfe with any griefe, considering that it lay in him to helpe it. The Ladye aunswered, that she had so long kept it from his knowledge, bicause she doubted whether hee would be content to performe it or not, although it was such a thing as he might easely graunt without any manner of hurt to himself, & yet now in the ende she was forced to aduenture vppon his curtesie, being no longer able to beare ye burde of hir griefe: the louer solicited her most earnestly to disclose it: and she (as fast) seemed to mistrust that he would not accomplish it. In the ende she tooke out a booke (which she had brought for the nonce) & bound him by othe to accomplishe it. The louer mistrusting nothing lesse tha that ensued, toke the othe willingly, which done, she declared al that had passed betwene hir & hir husband: his griefe, hir repentance, his pardon, hir vowe, and in the ende of hir tale enioyned the louer, that from thence forthwardes, he should neuer attempt to breake her constant determinatio, the louer replied that this was vnpossible. But she plainlye assured him, that if he graunted hir that request, she would be his friend in al honest & godly wise: if not, she put him out of doubt that she would eschew his company and flee from his sight as from a scorpion. The louer considering that hir request was but iust, accusing his owne guiltye conscience, remembring the great curtesies alwayes vsed by hir husband, and therewithall seeing the case now brought to such an issue, as that by no other meanes than by this it could be conceiled from the knowledge of the worlde: but most of all, being vrged by his othe, dyd at last giue an vnwilling consent, and yet a faithful promise to yelde vnto hir wyl in al thinges, and thus being become of one assent, he remaineth the derest friend & most welcome gest that may be, both to the Lady and hir husband: and the man and the wife so kind (each to other) as if there neuer had bene such a breche betwen them. Now, of you noble Gouernor I would faine lerne, whether the perplexity of the husband when he looked in at the keye hoole, or of the wife when she knewe the cause why the Carolines were so scattered, or of the louer when he knew what was his mistres charge, was greater of ye three? I might haue put in also ye troubled thoughts of the sisters & the mayd, when they saw their good wil reiected, but let these three suffice. Gentle Hope (quod Ferdinando ) you haue rehearsed ( & that right eloquetly) a notable tale, or rather a notable history, because you seeme to affirme, that is was done in dede of late & not far hence. Wherein I note fiue especial pointes: that is a maruailous patience in the husband, no lesse repentaunce in the wife, no smal boldnesse of the mayde, but muche more rashnesse in the sisters, & last of al, a rare tractabilitie in the louer. Neuerthelesse to returne vnto your question. I thinke the husbands perplexity greatest, because his losses abounded aboue the rest, & his iniuries were vncoparable. The Lady Fraunces did not seme to contrary him but rather smiled in hir sleeue at Dame Pergo , who had no lesse patience to here the tale recited, then the Lady Fraunces had pleasure in telling of it. By this time the sleeping houre aproched, & the Ladyes prepared their departure, when as mistres Frauces sayd vnto ye Venetiane : Although percase I shall not do it so hadsomly as your mistres, yet good Trust (quod she) if you vouchsafe it, I can be content to trim vp your bed in the best manner that I may, as on who would be as glad as she to procure your quiet rest. Ferdinando gaue hir great thaks desiring hir not to trouble hirself, but to let his man alone with ye charge. Thus they departed,  & how al partyes toke rest that night I knowe not: but in ye morning Ferdinando began to consider with himselfe that he might lye long ynough in his bed before his mistres would be apeased in hir peuishe conceipts: wherfore he arose, & being aparelled in his night gowne, tooke occation to walke in the gallery neere adioyning vnto his mistres chamber: but there might he walke long inough ere his Mistresse would come to walke with him. When dinner time came he went into the great chamber whereas the Lord of the Castle saluted him, being ioyful of his recouerye: Ieronimy giuing due thanks, declared that his friedly entertainement togeather with the great curtesie of the gentlewomen was such, as might reuiue a man although he were halfe dead. I would bee loath (quod the hoast) that any Gentleman comming to mee for good wyll, shoulde want any curtesie of intertainement that lyeth in my power. When the meate was serued to the table, the Gentlewomen came in all but Dame Elynor and Mistresse Pergo , the which Ferdinando marked very well, and it dyd somewhat abate his apetite. After diner, his Hope came vnto him and demaunded of him howe hee would passe the daye for his recreation? to whome he answered euen as it best pleased hir. She deuised to walke into the parke, and so by litle and litle to acquaint himself with the ayre: he agreed, and they walked togeather being accompanied with one or two other gentlewomen. And although there were nowe more cause that hee shoulde mistrust his Mistresse than euer he had before receyued, yet the vehement passions which he sawe in her when she first came to visite him, and moreouer the earnest words which she pronounced in his extremitie, were such a refreshing to his minde, as that he determined no more to trouble him selfe with like conceiptes: concluding further, that if his mistresse were not faultie, then had he comitted a foule offence in needeles ielousie, and that if she were faultie (especiallye with the Secretarie ) then no perswation could amend hir, nor any passion helpe him? and this was the cause that enabled him after suche passing panges to abide the doubtfull conclusion: And thus manfully and valiantly to represse faintnesse of his mind: nothing doubting but that he should haue won his mistresse to pardon his presumption,  & louingly to imbrace his seruice in wonted maner: but he was farre deceiued, for shee was nowe in a nother tewne, the which Mistresse Fraunces began partly to discouer vnto him as they walked togeather: for she burdened him that his mallady proceded onely of a disquiet minde. And if it dyd so my gentle Hope (quod he) what remedy? My good Trust (quod she) none other but to plant quiet where disquiet began to grow. I haue determined (quod he) but I must craue the helpe of your assured friendship. Therof you may make accompt (quod she) but wherein? Ferdinando walking apart with hir, began to declare that there was some contention hapened betweene his mistres and him: the Lady tolde him that she was not ignoraunt thereof. Then he desired hir to treate so much in the cause, as they might eftsons come to Parlee : thereof I dare assure you (quod Mistresse Fraunces ,) and at their returne she led him into his Mistresse Chamber, whome they founde lying on hir bed, whether gauled with any griefe, or weary of the thing (which you woote of) I know not, but there she lay: vnto whome Ferdinando gaue two or three salutations before she seemed to marke him. At last sayd the Lady Fraunces vnto hir, your seruaunt hearing of your sicknesse, hath aduentured thus far into the ayre to see you. I thank him (quod dame Elinor )  & so lay still, refusing to giue him any countenace. Whereat he perceiuing all the other Gentlewomen fall to whispering, thought good, boldlye to pleade his owne case: and approching the bed began to enforce his vnwylling Mistresse vnto curtesie, wherein he vsed such vehemence as she could not wel by any meanes refuse to talk with him: but what their talke was, I may not take vpon me to tel you. Sufficeth this to be known, that in the end she pretended to passe ouer all olde grudges, and thencefoorth to pleasuure him as occation might serue, the which occation was so long in hapening, that in the ende he being nowe eftsones troubled with vnquiet fantasies, and forced to vse his penne againe as an Ambassadour betweene them: one daye amongst the rest found oportunitye to thrust a letter into her bosome, wherein hee had earnestly requested another Mooneshine banquet or frydayes breakfast to recomfort his dulled spirites, wherevnto the Dame yelded this aunswere in writing, but of whose endyting iudge you. I can but smyle at your simplicitye, who burden your frends with an impossibility. The case so stode as I could not though I would. Wherefore from hence foorth either learne to frame your request more reasonablye, or else stand content with a flat repulse. SHE. Ferdinando liked this letter but a litle:  & being thereby drouen into his accustomed vaine, he compiled in verse this aunswere folowing, vpon these wordes conteined in her letter, I could not though I would .  I could not though I would: good Ladie saie not so, Since one good word of your good wil might sone redresse my wo, VVhere would is free before, there could can neuer faile: For profe, you see how gallies passe where ships ca bere no saile, The wearie marriner where skies are ouercast, By readie will doth guide his skil and wins the hauen at last, The pretie bird that singes with pricke against her brest. Doth make a vertue of hir nede, to watche when others rest, And true the prouerbe is, which you haue laide apart, There is no hap can seeme to hard vnto a willing heart. Then louelie Ladie mine, you saie not as you should, In doutful tearms to answere thus: I could not though I would. Yes yes, full well you know, your can is quicke and good: And wilfull will is eke too swift, to shed my guiltlesse blood. But if good will were bent as prest as power is, Such will would quicklie find the skil to mende that is a misse. VVherefore if you desire to see my true loue spilt, Commaund and I will slea my selfe, that yours maie be the gilt, But if you haue no power to saie your seruaunt naie, VVrite thus: I maie not as I would, yet must I as I maie. Ferdinando, Ieronimy.  Thus Ieronimy replied vpon his Mistres answere, hoping thereby to recouer some fauour at hir hands, but it would not be: so that nowe he had bene as likelye (as at the first) to haue fretted in fantasies, had not the Ladye Fraunces cotinually comforted him: and by litle & litle she droue suche reason into his minde, that now he began to subdue his humor with discretion, and to determine that if he might espie euident profe of his Mistres fraieltie, he would then stand content with patience perforce, & geue his Mistres the Bezo[![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) la, mano  . And it happened one daye amongst others, that he resorted to his mistresse chamber and founde her ( allo solito ) lying vppon her bed, and the Secretarie with Dame Pergo and her handmaide keeping of her company. Whereat Ferdinando somewhat repyning, came to her and fell to dalliaunce, as one that had nowe rather aduenture to be thought presumptious than yeelde to be accompted bashfull, he cast his harme ouer his Mistresse, and began to accuse hir of sluggishnes, vsing some other bolde partes, as well to prouoke hir, as also to grieue the other. The Ladye seemed litle to delight in his dallying, but cast a glance at hir Secretarie ,  & therewith smiled, when as the Secretarie and Dame Pergo burst out into open laughter. The which Ferdinando perceiuing, and disdaining her ingratitude, was forced to depart, and in that fantasie compiled this Sonet.  I stoode of late to pleade for pitie so: And as I did hir louelie lookes beholde, Shee cast a glaunce vpon my riuall foe. His fleering face prouoked hir to smile, VVhen my salt teares were drowned in disdaine: He glad, I sad, he laught, (alas the while) I wept for woe: I pin'd for deadlie paine. And when I sawe none other boote preuaile, But reason rule must guide my skilfull minde: VVhy then (quod I) olde prouerbes neuer faile, For yet was neuer good Cat out of kinde. Nor woman true but euen as stories tell, VVonne with an egge, and lost againe with shell. Ferdinando. Ieronimy.  This Sonet declareth that he began now to accompt of hir as she deserued, for it hath a sharpe conclusion, and it is somewhat too general. Well, as it is he lost it, where his Mistresse found it, and she immediatly imparted the same vnto Dame Pergo , and Dame Pergo vnto others: so that it quickely became common in the house. Amongst others Mistres Fraunces hauing recouered a copie of it. did seme to pardon the generallity, and to bee wel pleased with the perticularity thereof, the whiche shee bewraied one daye vnto Ferdinando in this wise. Of all the ioyes that euer I had (my good Trust quod shee) there is none where in I take more comforte than in your conformity. And although your present rage is such that you can bee content to condemne a number vnknowen, for the transgression of one to well knowne: yet I doe rather reioyce that you should iudge your pleasure ouer many, than too be abused by any. My good Hope (quod he) it were not reason that after such manyfold profes of your exceding curtesies, I should vse straung or contencious speech with so deare a friend. And in deed I must confesse that the opinion which I haue conceiued of my Mistresse, hath stirred my penne to write very hardly agaynst all the feminine gender. But I praye you pardon me (quod he)  & if it please you I will recant it, as also (parcase) I was but cloyd with surcuydrye , and presumed to think more than may be proued. Yea but how if it were proued quod Dame Fraunces ? If it were so (which God forbid quod he) then coulde you not blame me to conceiue that opinion. Howsoeuer I might blame you (quod she) I meane not to blame you, but I demaund further, if it be as I thinke  & you suspect, what will you then do? Surely (quod he) I haue determined to drinke vp mine own sorow secretly, and to bid them both a Dieu . I like your farewell better than your fantasie (quod she) and whensoeuer you can be content to take somuch paynes, as the Knight (which had a night gowne garded with naked swordes) dyd take, I thinke you maye put your selfe out of doubt of all these thynges. By these wordes and other speech which she vttered vnto him, Ferdinando smelt how the world wente about, and therefore dyd one day in the grey morning aduenture to passe through the gallery towardes his Mistresse Chamber, hoping to haue found the doore open, but he founde the contrarye, and there attending in good deuotion, hearde the parting of his Mistresse and hir Secretarie , with many kinde wordes: whereby it appeared that the one was very loth to depart from the other. Poore Ieronimy was enforced to beare this burden, and after hee had attended there as long as the light woulde giue him leaue, he departed also to his Chamber, and apparelling himselfe, could not be quiet vntyll he had spoken with his mistresse, whome he burdened flatly with this despitefull trecherye: and she as fast denyed it, vntyl at last being styll vrged with such euident tokens as he alleadged, shee gaue him this bone to gnawe vppon. And if I dyd so (quod shee) what than? Wherevnto Ferdinando made none answere, but departed with this farewel. My losse is mine owne, and your gaine is none of yours, and sooner can I recouer my losse, than you enioye the gaine which you gape after . And when hee was in place sollitary, he compiled these following for a finall ende of the matter.  And if I did what then? Are you agreeued therefore? The Sea hath fishe for euerie man, And what would you haue more? Thus did my Mistresse once, Amaze my minde with doubt: And popt a question for the nonce, To beate my braines about. VVhereto I thus replied, Eache Fisherman can wishe, That all the Seas at euerie tide, VVere his aloane to fishe. And so did I (in vaine,) But since it maie not be: Let such fishe there as finde the gaine, And leaue the losse for me. And with such lucke and losse, I will content my selfe: Till tydes of turning time maye tosse, Suche fishers on the shelfe. And when they sticke on sandes, That euerie man maie see: Then will I laugh and clappe my handes, As they doe nowe at mee. Ferdinando Ieronimy.  Thus Ferdinando being no longer able to beare these extreeme despites, resolued to absent him selfe, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) swell for his owne further quiete, as also to auoide the occasion of greater mischiefes that might ensewe: And although the exceeding curtesies and approued fidelitie of Dame Fraunces had beene sufficient to allure the fast lyking of any man, especially considering that shee was reasonably fayre, and descended of a worthy father, who nowe fell flatlye to moue and solicite the same, yet such sinistre conceyptes had he taken by the frailtye of Dame Elinor , as that reiecting all proffers, and contempning all curtesies, he tooke his leaue, & (without pretence of returne) departed to his house in Venice : spending there ye rest of his dayes in a dissolute kind of lyfe: & abandoning the worthy Lady [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Fraunces Chima , who (dayly being gauled with the griefe of his great ingratitude) dyd shortlye bring hir selfe into a myserable consumption: whereof (after three yeares languishing) shee dyed: Notwithstanding al which [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD81F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) occurements the Lady Elinor liued long in ye continuance of hir acustomed change: & thus we see that where wicked lust doeth beare the name of loue, it doth not onelye infecte the lyght minded, but it maye also become confusion to others which are vowed to constancie. And to that ende I haue recyted this Fable which maye serue as ensample to warne the youthfull reader from attempting the lyke worthles enterprise. I knowe not howe my rude translation thereof wyll delight the finest iudgementes: But sure as Bartello writteth it in Italian , it is both pleasaunt and profitable: the which hath made mee aduenture thus to publishe the same in such simple style as I am able to endite: Desiring the gentle reader, rather to take example of reformation therein, then to finde faulte at the homelye handling of the same.
