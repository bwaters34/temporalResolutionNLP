 more torment some then others; for beauty hath such power, and her power such vertue, that (in a manner) all Mortals are some times scorcht with the ardent flames of her tirannical recognisance; as well Potentates, as Impotents, fight under the banner of Beauty; and Cupid , the Paphian Archer, being blind, as soone strikes Robes as Rags; Art can never displace the impression which Nature hath imprinted, nor Dignities ever avoid that which Divinity setteth down for a period. All men are subject to Love; therefore no marvel if Love so seize the top of Princes conceits, that they build their external felicity upon enjoying their Mistris favour; and lay their (sacred supposed) foundation of hope, in being inrolled a servant upon the memorial of their Saints contemplations: Youthful fancies very often run at randome; yet being once in the field of love, vanquished by the prospect of some excelling beauty, they so render themselves captives to the (Circes) inchantments of partial complexions, that they will not onely ingage their constancy for the obtaining of their hearts desire, but also pawn their lives, yea fidelities, for the establishing of their breasts contentation; as by the sequel of this ensuing History shall most manifestly appeare. Center of the Mediteranean sea, is most gallantly embelished with the Treasure of Ceres and Flora ) Before ever the (inhumane) Pride of Tyrannizing Spaine domineered in these Quarters; there sometimes reigned a vertuous and valorous King named Druyno ; whose skil in Martial exploits, and knowledge in industrious Sciences, did no lesse daunt the courage of his professed Enemies abroad, then with content satisfie the expectations of his loyal Subjects at home. Who having lived a long time with his beautiful Queen (and Wife) Gratiana , without Issue, being Daughter to Polydor King of Barbaria , had at last in his old declining age, when Reason would have induc'd men to believe that his hoary white hairs (as the Avant Coureurs of Thanatos ) betokened a speedy death, A very gallant young Son; to the no little applause of his aged Father, and no lesse rejoycing of his (more then) joyful Subjects; who in stellification of their young Prince his nativity, so sumptuously solemnized his Birth with Heroical triumphs, that all Forain travellers being spectators of their voluntary Bountifulnes, might condignly conjecture them (I mean the generality of true-hearted Cicilians ) to be exactly ravished in an Extasie of celestial contentation. Which Princely Babe being baptized with such pompous (magnificent) solemnity, as was correspondent to his Noble extraction, was in fine by the King his Father (with the consent of his Honorable Parents) named Thalmeno . Who being nurst with care, and disciplinated by the most expert Martialists of Europa ; At the age of seven years, had so well profited in the (couragious) School of Bellona , that the Physnomie of his face, as true Almanacks of future Qualities, did perfectly prognosticate that his Princely self would at the age of Reason undoubtedly merit to be triumphantly crowned with the superlative Laurel garlands of Olympian dignified fame. Beautiful he was of complexion; more curiously resembling Adonis then Paris: Courteous he was of demeanour; for his Benignity surpassed the Affability of Alexander: And more then exceeding discreet he was of Capacity; for that from his supereloquent Tongue flew the very inchanting Phrases of admired Demosthenes . So that as Nature had surpassed her (intricate) skill, in framing him outwardly most excellent; Art likewise had bestowed her chiefest curiosity in bedecking the Temple of his Cerebrosity with the prime of ingenious Industry. Palas , if she had heard his report, would have praised his perfection: Juno , if she had seen his Personage, would have forsaken her Jupiter: And the Syrenes themselves, if they had setled their sights upon the soyle of his Physnomie, would have withdrawn their melody from fearful Ulysses , and tun'd the harmony of their Voyces to invest only Thalmeno their Favourite; who in the bloomy spring-time of his tender Juvenility demonstrated so many vertuous Apparitions of his Princely towardnesse, that King Druino his Father rendred many millions of thanks to sacred Jehovah for giving him so sweet a Sonne; and his joyful Cicilians yielded devout gratulations to Goddesse Fortune , for affording them so gallant an Heire to their flourishing Empire. Which heroical young Prince, being the very Map of Modesty, the Patron of Piety, and the Flower of Audacious Magnanimity; had no sooner made the Horologe of Time sound the year fifteenth of his age, but having from his cradle his tosticated conceits fixt upon renowned Travel, did upon the Rock of his valorous Resolutions so constantly determine to try what the event of his Princely fortunes might be, that youthful (yet majestical) desires still kindling within the embres of his Heroical affection, did at last so flame to the absolute fire of a desperate Determination, that, hap life or death, Thalmeno resolved, and in resolving vowed to passe the blasts of Boreas , and streams of Neptune ; the better to adorn the storehouse of his Conceits, with the strange Accidental sights of some foraign Novelties. But here a main Battel of Incumbrances began to pitch a million of Doubts in the aspiring Cell of his Imaginations: For first considering, that to depart sans Conge , were to bereave his Father of his onely Comfort, and to forsake Cicilia were to withdraw his staffe of Consolation; (The which precedent premises considering) he again resolved to intomb his military Resolution in the evaporating dust of Oblivion: so that smothering up the submissive Motives of Obedience in the concavity of Self-will; and pricking forwards the superbity of his senses with dignified Spur of Honour; He lastly resolved, that maugre the effects of Fortune, or the treachery of Time, very soon to depart. But this his private secrecie was not so surely conceal'd in silence, but the newes thereof arrived to (the Harbour of) his Cosen Palmas understanding, being only Sonne to Blithgora King of Egypt ; who having his capacity tickled with the exquisite Etymologie thereof, could reap no perfect rest of his disturb'd Contemplation, untill he had engaged himself a Participator of his Cousins adventurous proceedings. Whereupon finding Thalmeno in the Arboury desolate, he very familiarly began to discover him the Physnomie of his audacious resolution: The which Zephyr- novelty Thalmeno no sooner understood, but being in conceit with celestial Applause ravished, in that he found so Princely a Compartner of his future fortunes, he to the purity of affectionate Intreaty most soon condiscended: So that each taking a Page, with such commodious necessaries as was befitting their Voyage, they very closely in a night (when the Moon being over-shadowed with obscure Clouds, seemed to condescend to their resolutions) most secretly departed, directing their course to Trapani one of the chiefest Ports in Cicilia ; where finding an Argazil ready to set sail, bound for the Country of Arabia , they instantly (with rejoycing contemplations, being glad that Dame Fortune had so soon provided them speedy passages, without making the King, Court, or Commons acquainted with their pretence) imbarqued themselves. Who after finding these two tender Princes absent; what sorrowful mournings, melancholy aggravations, and distempered dolefulnesse was in all places, but especially in the Palace-Resident, I referre to the discreet Readers impartial censure. And in respect that our History dependeth not on their Bewailings, but on the Adventurous proceedings of our Bloomy young Princes; I will for a while leave their sorrowes to be comforted by the Dictamnum of patience: And return again to the azured Common-wealth of Neptune , whereon these our Princely Paragons were fortunately sailing; who tracing upon the Deck, not onely reaped exquisite applause, to see the Armatho furiously cut through the surges of the Seas, but also enjoyed the Prerogative of delectable exhilaration in beholding the Zephyr-Gale fairly blow the Swanlike Sails from the superbious Mast. Which so long lasted, that in time they were fortunately come within kenne of their desired Port: whereat the whole Company, but especially our two young Princes rejoycing, they forthwith generally rendred many millions of zealous gratulations to Divine Jove , in that so favourably he had blest them with wished-for successe: who seeing their Argasill at an Anchor, and having invested themselves with fresh habilements, did thereupon forthwith entreat the Master to set them ashore, which immediately was accomplished: At whose triumphant departure, the heroical Mariners let flie such a thundering peal of Ordnance, that the Report thereof rebounding from the concavity of the clifty Shores, not onely made these our valorous Martialists tremble, but also terrified Belona her self (being resident) in the Citadel of her celestial Monarchy: But the brumy smoak thereof being evaporated with the freshnesse of the furious wind, our Princely gallants instantly attained the Shores; and royally rewarding the Boatsens gang, they betook themselves to the commencing of their desperate adventures: Where through the African Desarts they solitarily so long travelled, that at last being destitute of victuals, and not finding wherewith to content nature (in respect these parts were un-inhabited) they passionately tracing these unknown groves, very grievously began to exclaim upon the inhumane disaster of their miserable calamities; but in vain, for they saw no food to replenish their hungry appetites, unlesse to have brutishly fed upon unknown roots; which exactly they disdained, hoping ere long to harbour themselves in some homely Cottage, where with rustical Cates they might appease their gormandizing hunger: Upon the foundation of which hope, advancing their pace, they at last came to the descent of a deep Valley, where with a faint courage very pensively walking, they through the thicket of an ancient Forrest might espie the Architecture of some domestical Mansion, which to their sorrowful contemplations producing unexpected encouragement, they arming themselves with audacity, thereunto directed their course; where being to the outer gate arrived, they beheld a famous Castle of sumptuous edifice, but so solitarily situated in the Center of the aforesaid Forrest, that the wind piercing most dolefully through the branches of the lofty Cedars, made such a mournful murmur of disconsolate melody, that the dolefulnesse thereof drave our two young Princes into a very distasteful conceit of effeminate despair: But at last, hunger constraining them, they resolved to enter; where opening the outer-gate, they past the first Court without espying any; and entering the second, they beheld a delicious Court, most ingeniously paved with illustrious Marble, which very stately was circumferenc'd with a sumptuous arch'd gallery, prop'd up by Pillars of bright shining Alabaster; from which by chance reflecting their eyes, they forthwith saw a sweet amiable Lady, which under the umbrage of a Fig-tree sate recreating her sences with the dulcid sound of a delectable Lute, and thereunto contracting her Angelical voyce, she harmoniously breathed out this sorrowful Sonnet.  My mournful breast! into the duskie ayre Send forth sad sighes, true witnesse of thy plaint; Band pearled Teares unto Jove's sacred spheare, And shew how with Love's sorrows thou dost faint. Unvail the curtains of thy misery Before the Throne of great Jehova's sight, That contemplating on thy Tragedy, He may send favour on thy side to fight; Post therefore tears to Juno's Diety, Relate thy rage, display thy passions fire: Sincerely crave of her bright Sanctitie, The comble of thy mournful hearts desire. Fly throbbing sighes unto Dame fortunes throne, And thunder forth the taint of thy distresse: Unmask the subject of thy direful moan, And of her ( Janus ) power implore redresse. And both like twins of Dame Latona fair, Through Thetis sayle unto the Paphian Ile: Solicite Venus and young Cupid rare, That now discordant fate they will exile, And safely send Prince Maedor to thy sight, Whose Physnomy with chaste applauds my soul Hath vow'd eternally for to unite, And character in Adamantine roul. The which as soon as she had ended, repeating again and again the name of M aedor , one might apparantly perceive many pearled tears distil down the (sacred) soyl of her Vermilion cheeks, as also manifestly hear many secret sighes, which her perplexed heart sent forth, as testimonials of her tormented passions: And therewithal lifting up her eyes towards the seat of her Celestial Maker (as being overcome with too many insupportable sorrows) she instantly shrinking to the ground, fell into a dangerous trance. The which Tragical spectacle our two young Princes perceiving, very soon advancing their pace, stept to her assistance; And elevating her from the Flowrie-bank, whereon she was fallen, they used such, or at least the best preservative means for her recovery, as their unskilful (though willing) industrie could afford them: So that in time (by good fortune) she again recovered; And remembering her self (or at least thinking to remember her self) and seeing these two strangers before her, she very disdainfully (having anger seated in the furrows of her Brow) uttered these or the like words following. personages, invites me to term you) if you knew how divinely quiet I endured the enjoyance of this dangerous swound (or rather deadly slumber) whereinto I was fallen, I absolutely know (or at least audaciously conjecture) that in equity and reason you would have refrain'd from disturbing me of my rest, and also permitted me to reap the tenuity of my consolation: But since things past cannot be recall'd, because accidents once produc'd, do soon fly far, having Times wings; I will, on condition you speedily depart my Castle, for this your first offence give you an absolute pardon. I have here wholly betaken my self to sorrowfulnesse, and have long since devoted my zeal to the shrine of disconsolation; my desire is neither to see nor be seen, but rather to lead the pilgrimage of my life from the sight of any: This solitary place I have elected for my purgatory; And here, unlesse death prevent my premeditations, I resolve to abide the return of a most dear Friend of mine, which inconstant Fortune this fourty moneths hath detained from me. I in heart hate the sight of any, and for his sake loath the prospect of all. Therefore at the request of a sorrowful Lady, (or if ever a tormented Damsel, may gain acceptance at the Bar of your Discretion) I beseech you delay not to depart, That according to my accustomed manner I may sincerely upon the Altar of his absence, devoutly sacrifice my affectionate sighes; In token, that till death, in the Garden of my Maiden amitie, the resemblance of his self, and Idea of his perfections, shall (to my everlasting comfort and souls contentation) immortally flourish. The Princes having very lowly saluted this lovely Lady, and with attentive ears listened to the effect of her speeches, They both began, or at least Thalmeno for both, instantly to frame her this benigne reply. perfections demonstrate you to be) If our suddain arrival have prejudiced your sorrowful devotions, or detained you from executing some service due to your Friend; by so much the more we are thereof exceedingly discontented. But since the purity of our pretence may plead for the excuse of our audacity, and the innocency of our resolutions crave remission for our boldnesse; we doubt not, but having heard the History of proceedings, you will in equity afford us a benigne pardon: For, know fair Lady, that we are both Princes; The one heire apparant to the Crown of Egypt , and the other to the Diadem of Cicilia ; Our Names Palma , and Thalmeno : who in the prime of our bloomy minority, before the consideration of future fortune was established in the Zenith of our capacities, we resolved to travel, and so secretly imbarquing our selves (without taking leave of our Parents) we of late arrived in the next bordering Harbour; since which time, as (faithlesse) Fortune would, (Errour being our guide) we strayed into an unknown Desart, where these three dayes we have most dangerously travelled, without finding sustenance to relieve our hungry stomacks; So that at last ranging these solitary Forrests, we fortunately arrived to the view of these your Castle: Our pretence, fair Lady, is not to incur your indignation, but onely to intreat you to relieve us with some benigne demonstrations of courtesie; that in giving Nature her due, we may avoid the tyrannizing dint of Death, which most inhumanly doth now begin to domineer over us: which if you effect, as vertuous reason cannot well deny; we shall continually remain servants, both to your Bounty and Beauty; and till the period of death, hold the term of our lives as again re- bought by your Majestical merits, and likewise depart when it shall please you to command us. The Lady pondering upon these pitiful speeches, very soon in her breast conceived a motion of reletation, which flaming in the embers of her zealous imaginations, very secretly commanded her to entertain them with all agreeable curiosity: So that taking them kindly by the hand, she most debonairly conducted them to a very sumptuous Dining-chamber, where causing her waiting Virgins to attend, and furnish the Table with such store of rich poverty as her solitary Cell could afford, They very orderly without the vanity of prolixious ceremonies fell hungerly to their meat; till repast being done, the Princes satisfied, and the Tables taken up, Thalmeno still burning with desire to know the effectual cause of this Ladies desolate retirement, evaporating bashfulnesse, and arming his capacity with courage, he very boldly (yet with a Princely grace) continued his familiar Oration as followeth: your grief, or the display of your sorrows increase not your disconsolations, I would (if I might crave so much grace at your Lilie-hands) entreate you to relate why so sadly you make this Desart your domestical Mansion, And the occasion why so often with vollies of sighes you repeat the name of Medor . Me thinks your Beautiful face, Slender personage, Majestical comportment, and vertuous perfections, should rather befit a Monarchs Court then a Rural Countrey, and a Princes Bed then a Pilgrims Cottage. But whither wade I so far, since by experience I am taught to see, that all are subject to fate, and none exempt from adversity? for assoone the Prince as the Peasant, the Madame as the Milkmaid, are (or at least may be) crost with the dart of Cupid , the sting of sorrow, or the tyranny of misfortune; Therefore, faire Lady, if any of these distasteful accidents have befallen you, with the (Soveraigne) salve of Patience so mollifie your passions, and raze out your sorrowes, that the residence of aggravation may not overtop the blossoms of your flourishing Juvenility, and so Tragically bring your beautiful self to the (untimely) enjoyance of a desperate martyrdome. The Lady perceiving Prince Thalmeno had now ended his speech; For answer thereunto replyed him as followeth. absence of whom hath willingly constrained me to live thus solitarily. Name him I will not, because the motive thereof will refresh the birth of my accustomed disconsolation: yet in respect you shall not condemn me of perverse ingrateful coynesse, I will (if you please to attend my arrival) hye me to my Closet, and there constrain my trembling Pen to indite the secrets of his Mistris sorrowes, and in effect to discover the sole History of my as yet Tragical misfortunes. Our two young Princes joyful of this benigne courtesie, accepted of her proffer; and so having familiarly saluted each other, the Lady instantly with a tormented Complexion departed. But by that time a future houre was spent, and swiftly constrained to follow his forepast predecessors; Lo, immediately the Lady descended the staires, and so presenting her self to their viewes, delivered them this short speech following: scroll; wherein though rudely, yet sincerely I have demonstrated the cause of my retiring hither, and penn'd down the sorrowes which in heart I do (more then sorrowfully) endure. My present wealth is such, as I cannot afford you many gifts; yet as a Testimonial of my zealous affection towards you, here take these Victuals, and small summes of mony, to repleat your necessities, when any future occasion shall present. What you find fault with in this Castle, I pray forget with favour, or in me I beseech you remit with partiality: In recompence whereof, I will sacrifice my devout prayers for the establishing of your prosperity,  & beseech th'Almighty to send you a most fortunate and safe Retnrn. In hope whereof, betaking you to your journy, and my self to my accustomed Cell of disconsolations, I most dolefully in all Honour take my sorrowfull Conge . Thalmeno and Parma receiving the Scroll, with weeping teares kist her mournful cheeks; And so rendring her many millions of thanks for their unmerited courteous entertainment, most sorrowfully departed, directing their course to a very high Mountain: whose top having attained, and burning with desire to peruse the Scroll, they at last casting themselves on a green Bank, embelished with the essence of many diapred Flowers, under the covert of a stately Pine-tree, whose branches were likewise apparalled with a Summers vesture; taking the Paper in their hand, found this or the like therein contained. conditions) Being that in courtesie you have requested my abrupt Muse to relate you the cause of this my desolate retirement, Know (valorous Martialists) that I am Florina , the onely Daughter of Agenor King of Numidia ; who attaining to the perfect age wherein Nature seems to triumph in the delectable pleasure of Nuptial ceremonies, I was sought for in marriage by divers Princes both of Africa and Europe ; whereof as the King my Father affected some for their private wealth, so others I hated for their publique enormities; in such sort, that to be plain, I could not esteem of any with whom I was contented to finish the limits of this my terrestrial pilgrimage: by vertue whereof, I some two yeares remained without either fixing mine eyes upon the influence of Love, or ever devoting my breast to the shrine of Affection. But at last Cupid storming at my liberty, and Venus her self at my single estate, (acknowledging that there was no life but Love, nor no paradise but the pleasures of Mariage) They so bent their invective ambition against my innocencie; that at last by the means of Fortune , which had likewise intruded her self in the union of their sympathie, they unexpectedly to my Fathers Court sent a sweet young Prince named M aedor , being sonne and heire to Orlando King of Biafara ; which Prince being penetrated with the report of my Personage, came of purpose to Numidia to protest him my Servant: Upon the soyle of whose beautiful Complexion I no sooner setled the influence of my Regards, but I immediately felt the flames of fancy sparkle within the concavity of my tormented breast. On the other side, Prince M aedor so often frequented my company, that at last (if his protestations were unfained) he reposed his blisse in my Beauty, and reaped his chiefest pleasure in enjoying my (desired) presence: So that tract of time did (by reason of many amorous Glances) so firmly unite our Affections with the twist of combined Ratification, that in few dayes I became Mistresse of his thoughts, and he Master of my imaginations. But now despightful Destiny resolving to metamorphise our sweet Nectar into bitter Aconitum ; began to display part of his infidelity: For the news of this our late familiarity being bruited throughout the Court, did in fine arrive to the King my Fathers understanding; who storming at this unexpected event, (because he bore a secret malice to Orlando Prince Medors Father) resolved not only to nip the blossoms of this our tender Affections in the April of their minority, but also to blast the Buds of our Love in the spring-time of their juvenility: In respect whereof, sending for Prince Medor before his Royal personage, he after having imbathed his capacity in the Acheron of indignation, so checkt him up with thundring threats, and frowned at him with invective speeches, that in fine, albeit Prince Medor began with a pithy Oration to plead for himself, and in his defence to descant upon his unmerited discourtesie; He not onely commanded him to silence, but also charged him to depart the Territories of his Kingdome. Ah infortunate sentence for so sweet a Prince! And therefore infortunate, because being constrained to depart, he left me desolate in the distasteful surges of perplexity! But again, after the King my father had bereaved me of this my Princely Paramour, (within the influence of whose personage I reposed my delectable contentation) being not any thing appeased with this his inhumane accident, but still severely determining to invest me with the recognisance of his wrath, He so cruelly intreated me, and so unnaturally restrained my liberty, that I could not one minute reap repose of my Imaginations, but continually lived in most tormented calamity; in respect whereof sacrificing my Oraisons upon the Altar of Prince Medors absence, and devolving my contemplations to the beautiful Idea of his excellencies, accounting Courtly joyes vainglorious trifles, and a Princely life a splendent misery; In a Cymmerian night, which seemed to allow of my resolutions, departed the Court, and betook my self to the establishing of so sorrowful life. So at last Fortune resolving to assist me in my misery, very happily made me retire hither; which solitary Castle doth so correspond with my mournful conceits, that for the ardent love which I beare Prince Medor , I firmly resolve either here to attend his (expected) arrival, or else to finish my dayes in manifestation of my fidelity. Therefore (sweet Princes) attribute my disobedience to my Parents a favourable censure; and resolve, that what my pen prescribeth, my capacity shall perform; that is, Immortally to remain faithful to Medor , or everlastingly unfriendly to my self. Which scroll they had no sooner perused, but pitying the estate of the miserable Damsel, they instantly vowed to range the confines of Africa in researching Prince Medor , that by their friendly diligence Florina might injoy her breasts chiefest solace and her soules delectable contentation: By vertue of which infused resolution elevating themselves from the fragrant grasse, they at last, with delicious familiar Amity, and delectable friendly applause prosecuted their Journey, in such pleasant sort that Phoebus gracing the Cincture of the day with his radiant complexion, they traversing many lofty mountains, and pleasant Penean Valleyes, at last towards the approach of drowsie Vesper arrived to a silver Fount ore-vaild with the Canopie of a sprowting Cypres , who frizling his curled locks, took this Chrystal spring to be his reflective mirrour, whereon (with Narcissus ) delighting to gaze, he continually trimmed himselfe in his verdant jolity: many Angelical Nymphs they likewise saw circumferencing this fountain in a Dance, who (resembling Daphne ) had their splendent haire dallying with the Nectar-breath of amiable Zephirus , being all apparel'd in Crimson Robes imbrodered with Lilies and Couslips; who no sooner saw our two Caviliers approaching, but thinking that the Shepheards and Satyres had sent them as spyes, thereby to intrap them in some treacherous Ambuscado, they forthwith (as having Pegasian wings) flew through the Thickets, with a far swifter pace then ever did Atalanta when she ran with Hippomanes: Our Princes seeing this Amorous Troope fled, were exceeding sorrowful that their arrival hindered their pastimes; so that hailing them with a shril Holaw, and perceiving none returned, they instantly sate them down upon the Diapred brim of the fountain; where accumulating many Nosegayes of Daffadillies , and prime flowers, they dipping them in the Orient water, therewith besprinkled their faces to refresh their spirits; so long, till reflecting their sight upon the excellency of the neighbouring Pasture, they at last espied a verdant Tent, on whose lofty Turret a snow-white Ensigne deliciously flourish'd in the Aire; whereat admiring, because they could not conjecture what this delightful object betokened, (as also to the end they might satisfie their ardent contemplations) they both very joyfully directed their course thither; which no sooner they approached, but they perceived it to be an Eglentine Bower: bespread (here and there) with Colombines and Damask-Roses , so that burning with desire (from point to point to survey it) they at last audaciously entered; where a snow-white Beagle being (with Argus eyes) awake, saluted them with his shrill (discordant) barking, wherewith as a vigilant servant arowsing (a Nymph) his Mistresse from sleep, she altogether at this unexpected Alarm began to teare through the Bower. But Venus and Diana , having metamorphosed their (forepast) malice, to a future Sympathie, so ordained, that her Amber locks should be intangled in the Eglantine Bryars; whereat our Princes setting hold of her loose Garments, did, despight her force, compell her to stay: but the Nymph thinking them to be Apollo and Jove , who had descended from Heaven to ravish her Maidenhood on earth, bitterly cryed out, and grievously tore the Tresses of her haire in a rage; the which our Princes perceiving, with faire exhortive speeches began to appease her aggravation, requesting her only to conduct them to some adjoyning Cottage, where for that night they might assuredly rest in some peaceful tranquility: whereat this jolly Nymph elevating her selfe from the earth, and gratifying them with many milions of thanks, bedecking her Lily Countenance with a cherry complexion, (as a skillful Pilot) very joyfully conducted them through the Woods and Forrests, where many Troopes of (Light-foot) Satyrs ran on before as triumphant Heraulds to proclaime them passage, so long till radiant Tytan flying the Zenith of our Horizon to alight the obscure Antipodes, she at last brought us to a sumptuous Palace, whose Pyramids and Towers superbiously presumed to elevate their tops in the (sacred) skies; the glorious sight whereof (repleating their senses with astonishment) made them conjecture it to be that admired Palace of renowned Felicia (so much dignified by the Pens of civil and prophane Poets) for the Wals hereof were of cleer glistering Alabaster, the gates of pure Chrystal, the pavement of black Jet intermix'd with azured Marble, the Battlements of refined Gold, the Arches of stately Porphyre, the windowes of translucent Diamonds beset with Carbuncles and Saphires, and the roof of Vermilion Coral, wrought Checkerwise with orient gards of Silver: what shall I say? The interiour lineaments owed nothing in correspondence to the outward Edifice; for the Portals and Galleries were of snow-white Ivory, the Bedsteds of clarent Amber, the Coverlids and Curtains of green Damask imbossed with Emeralds and Chrysolites, and the Tapestry of Crimson-Velvet imbrodered with Amethysts and Pearle. In the spacious Courts and delicious Bowers (which Flora had adorned with the Treasure of her painted Drapery) were likewise many curious (conceited) fountains, some thither conveyed by the instinct of Nature, and othersome they errected by the Ingeny of Art) There might you have seen Diana errais'd aloft upon a sumptuous Pillar, with a Bow in one hand, and a Banner (wherein was charactered Chastitie ) in the other, from whose Alabaster Paps the water sweetly distilling, was by her Nymphs in Chrystal Vases received, and so artificially conveyed to the Fountains center; and also another, where Pallas, Minerva , and Juno , do from their breasts raine Veines of water upon the beautiful faces of Daphne and Phylomela ; the which entering their corall lips, doth distill to the concavity of their Chrystaline Paps; from whence with a stern countenance, they furiously sprout it in the eyes of inhumane Jupiter and lustful Tereus ; also upon the borders of these fountains are growing many fruitful Fig-trees, whereon artificially range divers harmonious Birds, whose heavenly musique according with the waters murmure, doth yield forth many ravishing Tunes of Angelical melody: so that there wanted no bravery to make this sumptuous Palace a Terrestrial Paradice; It was impaled with lofty Woods, fenced Draw-bridges and impregnable Bulwarks, as also circumferenced with a dainty Rivers, within whose Tempee Gleam many Caistrine Swans most pleasantly imbathed themselves. So that our two Princes with their Nymph, being arrived to this dignified Palace, were forthwith met by an ancient Damsel, who seeming to be thereof Lady, very kindly bad them welcome: her habit was of a Sable hue, having her snowy haire dandling down her withered face; her beauty seem'd to be nipt by age; yet in the lineaments of her complexion lay furrowed the anatomy of an indifferent Countenance: the arches of her sorrowful eyes were overvailed with a crymson taint; from out whose conduits, it appeared, many brinish teares had had their issue. Which desolate Lady, after having had some conference with these our unknown Princes, and perceiving how the zeale of their youthful resolutions were devoted to travel, she with a faint voice delivered them these speeches: palace, but advance with applause! For your eyes shall be presented with such delectable objects, as shall both please your thoughts, and solace your contemplations. Whereat she abruptly brake off, and so as fast as the Postilions of Æ olus , fled to the Forrests. Our Princes seeing the sodain departure of this ancient Lady, exceedingly admired what this unlookt for novelty meant: But at last arming their resolutions with courage, as also seeing the sable night begin to orevaile the Element with obscurity, taking leave of their Nymph, they boldly entred; where no sooner they had past the outer gate, but they were forthwith met by two glorious Virgins, who saluting them with a smiling countenance, arm in arm most lovingly conducted them to a superbious Theatre, from whence they might deliciously behold many amorous Ladies and gallant Cavaliers circumferencing themselvs in a dance: from whence after having repleated their eyes with applause, they by the Ladies were conducted to a sumptuous Bed-chamber, where divers flourishing Knights were unchastely Courting of their beauteous Paragons, yea and with such unseemly dalliance, that Vesta , nay Venus her self could scarce refrain from blushing at their immoderate familiarity; In such sort, that being glutted with the variety of divers unchaste prospects, (which to repeat would but vainly replenish the Readers capacity with prejudicial contemplations) they were at last by many radiant Tapers alighted to their chambers; where to passe away the tediousnesse of the night, two lascivious Ladies were proffered to beare them company: But our young Princes (albeit ardently tempted with carnal inchantments) having their immoveable resolutions charactered upon the foundation of Honour (not accepting of this unexpected courtesie) very vertuously crav'd their absence; when thinking to repose themselves, lo they were instantly again sollicited by two tender Virgins, who bringing two Ivory Lutes in their hands, with their melodious ( Orphee ) Musique, thought to lull their premeditations asleep: Their breasts were nakedly unmask'd to the spectators eye, where one might apparently behold their Alabaster paps swell and sink at an instant, as being inspired with the luxurious winde of unsatiable desire. Immodest smiles they had at command; and with the Hi aena , their eyes darted forth prejudicial Assummons: Their outward vestments were both gay and loose, in all things fitly corresponding with their inward qualities: And their glistering Haire being escaped from the Tresses of Chastity, most viciously sported with their Chrystal complexions, as the amiable Fetters of Lust to inchant the Approachers. But neither their Syrene deceitful Melody, their sweet Aconitum -glances, nor their alluring lascivious gestures, could either (with Circes ) charm the capacity of our Princes, or else with Med aea inchant their conceits to range beyond the Lists of (dignified) Modesty: but like two religious Pilgrims they valorously fought against (vicious) Concupiscence, and ardently devoted their zeale to the shrine of Vertue: So that not passing for their smiles, nor esteeming of their temptations, they audaciously thrust them out their Chamber, and so securely bolting the door, betook themselves to sleep. But Morpheus had not long detained their spirits in delicious slumber, but having contracted his Influence with the instinct of Celestial deity, they were in the depth of Nocturnus arowsed by a grievous Clamour, which ratled in the Palace with such a thundering noise, as if the battlements, nay foundation thereof were subject to a sudden revolution; Grievous groans were plenty, Cries were common, and all diverted to such a tempestuous confused Chaos , as if the Atlas of the world had in the vivacitie of his fury assummoned the Confines of Earth to the dreadful day of Judgment: whereat our two young Princes, as having their obtuse senses repleated with feare, and their heroical courage daunted with timerosity, instantly stumbled from their beds, as if they had been transcended to the infernal concavity of obscure Acheron ; thinking that their glasse of life was already run, and that inhumane Thanatos had now taken his dart of tyrannie in hand, to finish the period of their terrestrial Catastrophies . But whiles being thus in the (supposed) path-way of destruction, lo there sodainly appeared unto them a delectable Dwarf, being apparalled in Crimson; which to evaporate their timerous despair, with an Angels voice pronounced them these speeches:  Fly Vice, flie Sin, flie Earthie vanitie, And with a martial courage feare displace; Detract no time, but with celeritie Come view the Beauty of Dame Vertues face. Our Princes seeing this pretty Pygmee, and with advised deliberation pondering upon the Etymoligie of his speeches, could not at first refrain from infusing their contemplations within the Cabinet of astonishment; but at last more seriously ruminating which way to elect for their security, they both resolved to follow the tender guide; thereby to free themselves from the peril of this ensuing stratagem; upon which resolution, arming their courage with magnanimity, they as having Pegasian wings flew through the Courts, directing their pace to a lofty mountain, from whence they espied this glorious Palace, to be suddenly swolne up in the earths concavity, and in such admired sort, that no appearance of foundation remained, but was utterly raz'd out as if the essence thereof had never there erected his (once) substantial situation. Which tragical (prospective) accident our Princes could not at first believe, but instantly thereupon surmised that their eyes and imaginations had been deluded with invasions: the Dwarf perceiving their doubtful perplexities, ran exactly from them; when to comfort their passions, the old forlorne Lady which they first met, again presented herself to their views, and so after having lowly saluted them, very mournfully uttered these speeches. invented this Tragedy for your advantage. The glorious Mansion which ye have seen destroyed, was the Palace of Folly , wherein only remained the Imps of luxurious Iniquity; who pampering up lustful Cytherea , were alwaies persecutors of chaste Diana: my society they ever disdained, and contumeliously smothered my Temples with the contagious Incense of Lubricitie; amongst which cursed Diabolical Regiment Perjury was rife, Swearing no sin, Pride a pearl, Lust a Lord, Ambition a Saint, and Treachery a Goddesse. But now (my sonnes) their immoderate Pride is past, their unchaste Desires extenuated, their devilish Oaths drowned, their aspiring Ambition evaporated, their gracelesse Treachery abolished, nay and all their superbious actions, with themselves, utterly destroyed, and furiously sent to remain in the infernal dungeon of everlasting perdition: Therefore beware by their (unaccustomed) stratagems, and let the mirrour of their misfortunes serve as an Instance to impale you within the circumference of Piety. And to the end that, being absent, you may still ponder and premeditate upon my Exhortations, here take this paper, and observe such Divine counsel as I have therein prescribed for your salvations. Which having said, she in the twinkling of an eye elevated her self in the aire, and so a brumy cloud orevailing her in the cincture of his imbracements, she immediately vanished. Our Princes astonished hereat, took up the paper, and opening it, found these Observations therein contained. 1\. Build the foundation of thy faith upon purity and piety, that thy zeale be not ecclipsed with the contagion of idolatry, but rather perfumed with the sweet incense of sincerity. 2\. Let devout Prayers be a Mediatrix between thy Saviour and thy self; for it is the most assured step to obtain felicity. 3\. Conceal thy secrets in the closet of thy breast; lest rashly displaying them to others, thou produce the prejudice of thine own tranquility. 4\. Flie Ambition, as the poison of the sense; and detest Envy, as the canker of thy contemplations. 5\. Gaze not on Beauty, lest it ingender repentance: but loath a lascivious Courtisan, as the scourge of iniquity. 6\. In thy Actions be faithful, lest being blemished with reproach thou impaire thy reputation. 7\. Honour thy Prince as the Anointed of Christ; and if occasion present, live and die for thy Country. 8\. Detest vainglorious Superbity, as the Aconitum of sinne; and abolish Superstition, as the cloak of ungodlines. Which having read, and knowing the sacred influence thereof tended to the establishing of their celestial tranquility; they so imprinted it in the concavity of their contemplations, as it futurely should serve for a fenced circumference to retaine them within the Confines of Piety; and likewise for an impregnable Cittadel to defend them from the fury of ungodlinesse: so as triumphing that fortune (in the Mirrour of experience) had presented them with so sacred an Instance, they repleating their thoughts with applauses, and their conceits with delectation, very joyfully departed. But wanne Aurora (being Daughter of Thetis ) had no sooner skipt from the bowers of Neptune , and so saluted the excellency of transplendent Phoebus , but our Princes afresh prepared them selves to their journey: When timely in the purpled morne, as radiant Titan began to give the Bezo les Manes to the verdent mountains; the Satyres, Fawns, and Nymphes skipt through the Forests; and dolefull Philomela (basinating her Breast in the aire on the superbous Peple) warbled forth her Tragedie: they were by a soft bloamy wind, which caused the verdant Leaves to caper, made acquainted with the delectable sound of a ravishing Cornet; the delicious (tripled) eccho whereof, redoubling through the thicknes of a curled Grove there next adjoyning, gave such a quavering grace to the aforesaid melody, that our Princes were perforce constrained to finde out the said (unknown) excelling Orpheus . To the end he might for a whiles recreate their distempered senses, with the rare exquisitnesse of his praise-worthy Art. And so directing their courses by their attentive Ears (which they took to be their guide) they at last arrived to the beautifull prospect of a faire ( Penean ) Valley; in midst whereof ran most leasureably a ( Tempe ) silver streame, whose Banks in equal distance were beset with fruitful Lemmon trees; on the Branches whereof, they might afarre off espie the yellow Citrons naturally growing: which delightful pleasant prospect so wel contented their youthful imaginations, that immediately they bent their course directly to the aforesaid Arboury; where entering, they espied this famous Musitian, being a beautiful young Boy, apparrelled in white, who being crowned with the Lawrel garland set upon a Flora -Bank close by the Rivers side, unto whose melody most attentively listening they at last in a fragrant Bower of delicious Eglantine espied an aged old Father, which as it seemed by the furrows of his complexion had in his tender years past the indurance of many distasteful calamities; his habit was of a Sable Black, which comming scarcely to his knees, was about his weak waste begirt with a Willow striple; his Visage was of a Wane taint; and his Snowy Beard, being milky-white, descended almost to his sorrowful middle; In his hand he held a Brazel staffe, which as it seemed, manifested to be the feeble supporter of his withered age; And before him, on a Table of Swan-like Alabaster lay open a guilded Book of absolute beautifulnesse, whereon in reading he solitarily busied the conceipts of his tormented cerebrositie; Which prospect as soon as our Princes espied, being instantly transported with desire to know the cause of his disconsolate retirement, they boldly entred, where interrupting him from his earnest study, Prince Palma , (to awake his distempered Muses from the Chaos of his perplexity) boarded him as followeth: term you,) If our audacious arrivals have disturbed your study, or our presence your patience; We beseech you to pardon the first, though a rash attempt; and to excuse the second, as being an unwilling enterprise. Travellers ears are (you know) amators of novelties, and their capacities as desirous of news, as the Antipodes of the sight of the Sun: Therefore, Reverend Father, we beseech you to relate us the cause of this your disconsolate retirement, and the motive which enduced you to imbrace this austere Life, as the Image whereunto your contemplations dedicate the generality of their terrestial devotions: As also to afford us so much favour, as (being forreiners, and unacquainted with the passages of this Country) we may under the support of some Debonaire Seigneur , erect (for a while) our residence; and so avoiding the scandalous imputation of Vagabonds, betake our resolutions to the obtaining of (desired) peaceful tranquillity. The antient Father perceiving by his speeches, that he had been trained up in the school of Vertue; as also conjecturing by the Physnomy of their countenances, that they were issued from some noble extraction; very kindly (with a gravity, which seemed to embellish his speeches) returned him this Friendly reply: disturbed my study, nor your presence prejudiced my patience: For as my nature is not attractive to severity on the one side, so on the contrary, I make use of the other at leisure. Therefore to my sorrowful Cel you are both exactly welcome: And in respect a friendly demand deserveth a familiar reply, Know (Gentlemen) that the Bower which I have here caused to be erected within the Incirculets of this fruitful grove, I make my retiring place, when passionate conceits begin to tosticate my distempered senses. This Boy being an Orphan, for charities sake I have caused to be instructed in the art of shril musique, to the end that when my eyes begin to dazle with overmuch reading, he may with his loud melody arouse my spirits from the thought of slumber, and so put me in mind of my accustomed duty, which in heart I immortally owe to the (sorrowful) shrine of my dead Saint, which whilst she lived I affected more dearly then my self; and being (now) dead, will honour with such ardent fidelity, that future ages shall have a meritorious instance to acknowledge, That till death, and after, to my fair Excellina I remained compleatly constant: Ah sweet Excellina! which sacred Name when I repeat, enforceth my cordial blood to distill my sorrowful heart, and also my brinish teares to descend the soile of my penitent cheeks; she (oh she!) was the unique daughter of a valorous Knight, whom I long courted with unfeigned love, and at last (after having received many bitter repulses) obtained the enjoyance of her gracious affection; whereof her shrewish step- mother being (by misfortune) throughly advertised, (as one that rather sought her ruine then advancement) she so severely lookt to her, and so inhumanely intreated her, that her Father being absent in a farre journey, she most tyrannously bolted her up in a Vestal dungeon; where seeing she could by no means obtain the object of my personage, she in the bitter anguish of ( Phlegiton ) dolor, (bidding the World, but chiefly Me, farewel) most dolefully yeelded nature her due; In remembrance of whom, to the other end of this Grove, in a Fragrant Valley, I have (as Duty and Love enforced me) erected a Tombe, whereunto till the period of my ending dayes, I have in heart daily vowed to offer her, not onely my devout Prayers, that I may soon follow her, but also my throbbing sighes, as repentant witnesses of my tormented calamity: Therefore Gentlemen, if you please to afford the time to walk thither, I will make your eyes spectators of that, which with great grief  & aggravation I have discovered to you; And after give you such Observations in your travels, that doubtlesse, if the celestial influence crosse not your Fortunes, you shall finde them very profitable for your advantage, and no way prejudicial to your adventures. The two Princes returning him thanks for his profered Courtesies, very willingly to his demand, soon condiscended; and so walking through ranks of lofty Cedars, which with their verdant branches beautified the adjoyning (silver) stream, They in fine arrived to a sacred Chappel, which with Alabaster Wals circumferenced that glorious Tombe; where entering, they espied it so repleated with munificent curious workmanship, that the view thereof drave them speedily more neer to approach, and so beheld the body thereof to be of Dove-white Ivorie, whose cover being of radiant Jeat, there was thereon the Picture of the aforesaid faire Excellina in Crymson fresh colours, most ingenously pourtraicted, and under her feet, in characters of rich Gold (Inammeled with Azur ) this Epitaph most sumptuously engraven.  Within this Ivorie Tombe doth lie The Phoenix of pure Modestie, Sweet Excelline , whose Beauty rare With Helens taint may well compare; Nay, Helens taint surpassing sure, Which did the Grecians Love procure; Being in Jove's Imperiall sight, A Nymph excelling Juno bright: Cut off by fatall Sisters three, In confluence of Loves plauditee . Therefore if any passe this way, With penitentiall tears doe pray, That she may in th' Elizian Plaine Vntill Eternitie remain; Still Crown'd with Hearts delicious joy, And freed from rage of dire annoy. Which Epitaph, when they had again and again over-read; as also reviewing the Tombe, and regarding her Picture, They very sorrowfully departed, to finde out the ancient Delmon (for so they knew him now to be named) who purposely attending their comming, took them by the Hand, and the tears standing in his Eyes, he (albeit his Tongue did falter) at last breathed out these speeches. too much offending my Soule, I could willingly be the administer of mine own (untimely) martyrdome; But alas, I know (I too truly know) that that would be a sacrifice too abominable before the sight of my Maker; which I protest is onely the Reine that withdraweth me from executing of my Resolutions: For why, though I live, I live discontented;  & by my death, my dolorous calamitie would enjoy a period. Should I, (most miserable I) be the cause of so sweet a Ladies destruction? Or, by my means should so gallant a Virgin be deprived of her future (delectable) pleasures? No, no, Delmon ; Live not, but die in memory of her Martyrdome; for so shall thy aggravations end, and thy everlasting joyes commence. Our two young Princes, seeing him run so farre in the diversity of (amourous) sorrow, thought best to recall him from his passionate dumps; and interrupting him, Thalmeno began as followeth. now (through Age) evacuated from your memory; and the remembrance thereof dryed up in the Cinders of Oblivion: For it is not for you, which are ready to salute the Grave, to sacrifice sighes to Cupid ; but rather for Youth, such as we are, to fight under the Banner of Beauty. Remember therefore with your self, that Venus was by Apelles Boy pourtraited with fresh colours, and not set forth with a withered Visage: and though Vulcan offered to the shrine of Juno , yet he at last cried peccavi , and was for his simplicity laught at by Jupiter . Therefore, Delmon , consider now with thy self, that Excellina is dead, and may not by any (mortal) possibility again be revived: In respect whereof, dry up your tears, and forget any more to devote your Oraisons to the image of Cytherea : that fighting 'gainst concupiscence, your actions may approve you to be an unspotted Personage for the celestial Monarchie; and while tracing on this earthly vale of misery to observe a blisful decorum of Aged staiednesse. Delmon perceiving he was answered somewhat roundly; instantly afresh wept, because their exhortive speeches toucht him to the quick: but at last comforting his sorrowful Muse with patience, he evapouring his tears requested them to enter his Cel,  & to accept of such homely Cates as his poverty could afford: whereunto they willingly agreed; and so deluding the time with familiar conference, they a long time solaced their capacities in amourous prattle; till at last repast being ended, and the Princes ready to depart; Delmon , with as much audacitie as his tormented passions could permit, at their Dernier adieu , pronounced them these speeches. Know, that some leagues hence, in the Kingdome of Zanfara , there reigneth a magnificent Prince, sirnamed Brilion , whose Vertue doth no lesse applause his Subjects, then his Valour doth daunt his Enemies; rewarding each with the guerdon of his merits, and retaining no honour from those which demonstrate their actions to be absolute magnanimous: So that, for Discretion, he may wel be esteemed a Solomon ; for Majesty, a C aesar ; for Prowess, a Scipio ; and for Benignity, an Alexander . His Court likewise may be tearmed the Rendevouz of the flower of Chivalry: for there are alwayes resident innumerable of Cavaliers; which as they account Discretion a chief point of valour, so they stick not (though desperately) to adventure their lives for the establishing of their fame. Their Senators likewise are both grave, politique, and provident; which from the sincerity of their contemplations, accompt Ambition a heinous crime, and Treachery a deadly sinne. Also their Pastors of the people are both zealous and vertuous, admonishing their Flocks, not with the servants of Baal , to place their Religion upon diabolical Idolatry, but to ground their zeale upon that Celestial Temple, whose foundation is Faith; whose pavement, Purity; whose doores, Devotion; whose arches, Amitie; whose pillars, Piety; whose windows, Sincerity; whose galleries, Glorification; and whose towers, Humility. Their Ladies and Damsels are likewise both gratious and faire, and generally so chaste, as if Diana and Nature had adorned them with the pride of their excellency; being of gesture, modest; of capacity, quick; of quality, kinde; and of behaviour, courteous. Therefore, Gentlemen, if you direct your course thither, you shal generally see each live by the fertilenes of his own Land, each reap the fruit of his own Vine, and (delectable) content sit smiling in every corner: there likewise shall you see the fragrant Fields adorned with their verdant vestures, the lofty Trees with their gay garments, and the delicious Arbours with their diaper'd treasure of Flora ; as also, the mountains oreveiled with snow-white Flocks, their Meadows with the riches of Ceres , and their Valleys with Daffadils, and prime flowers: In their Parks may you likewise see regiments of Fallow-Deer running untaken; in their Forrests may you likewise behold, troups of Nymphs trace unravished; and to be brief, on every bush, harmonious Birds warbling forth their melody. Thalmeno and Parma , perceiving that Delmon had finished his speech, being partly in conceit ravished with the report of so flourishing a Kingdom, giving him thanks for their benign entertainment, as also for his debonair vertuous exhortations, very joyfully departed: where travelling a long time these unknown Countries, they at last very fortunately arrived to the chiefest City of Zanfara , where the Court then was; And taking up the Lodge in the best Inne which the City did afford, they there some three dayes rested, to refresh themselves of their forepast (troublesome) travels: And after having (as was requisite) given almighty Jove most humble thanks for their safe arrival, they betook themselves to this private parley, where Thalmeno began as followeth. therefore with celerity it behoveth us to settle our proceedings upon the main of some resolution, to the end we may futurely avoid the receipt of ensuing misfortunes. Therefore, understanding that the King exceedingly delighteth in heroical Vertues, it were not in my opinion unfit to betake our selves under the umbrage of his service, where cherishing our valorous magnanimity, we may produce the demonstrations of dignified Princely atchievements, whose effectual apparitions in the eyes of all spectators may condignly purchase us the title of gallant (admired) admiration. Prince Palma hearing Thalmeno utter this haughty resolution, very instantly returned him this reply: determination: therefore, delayes set apart, let us proffer our selves to the Kings service. This day, I understand, he resolveth to hunt in a Forrest neer- adjoyning the Court; where, if you please, we may present him with a submissive supplication, thereby to intrude our selves within his Princely service; but let our names be obscured under the cloud of secrecy; So that Thalmeno may be termed Thalmo , and I Palma named Plivio , justifying our selves to be both Knights of Arabia . This pleasant invention was well liked of Thalmeno ; And so solacing their cerebrosity, they forthwith indited this supplication, which by a young Knight (a friend of theirs) they instantly sent to the Kings Majesty, the tenor whereof followeth,  Zanfara hath been transported to the bar of many Cavaliers understanding) in such sort, that they not only admire at your Princely valour, but also wonder at your (vertuous) animosity; so as their thoughts burning with desire to be made possessors of your (gracious) presence, and their resolutions flaming with applause to be spectators of your heroical audacity, they have upon the Altar of fame, long since devoted their resolutions to direct their course to your Country; amongst whom, we Thalmo and Plivio , two Knights of Arabia , having our capacities penetrated with the report of your affability, have undertaken this journey, to be made spectators of your renowned personage; So that being arrived to your flourishing Palace, we most humbly beseech you to accept us into your dignified service, assuring you, that our valour and fidelity shall be such, as shall well testifie our resolutions to take their offspring from audacious magnanimity. So imploring your Majesty to admit us into your service, and to grace us with that stellified Title to be invested your Servants, We in all humilitie prostrating our lives to your (gracious) command, Rest, Your Soveraign's devoted Vassals, Thalmo & Plivio .  This supplication was no sooner presented to King Brylion , but forthwith he commanded the two forraign Knights to be admitted to his presence, where saluting them in such sort as befitted his Royalty, He very benignly accepted of their voluntary service: Which famous acceptance adding applausible hope to our Princes expectations, made them in conceit conjecture that they were now at the foot to mount the steps of honour. And therein to conclude, because peradventure the discreet Reader may think the time too tedious in describing their proceedings, let this as a brief annotation suffice: That their valorous actions, vertuous demeanor, gallant comportment, heroical courtesie, and Princely grace, did so conquer the capacity not only of the King, but the Commons; that in a manner all the Island of Cicilia esteemed them worthy the prize of Olympian victory, I mean the Trophees of Laurel-dignified honour: Which by often demonstrations of their interior audacity did so instigate the King with the meritorious humour of preferring them, that not long after their arrivals, he appointed Thalmeno to be Attendant on the Princesse Athelia his daughter; and establish'd Plivio to be Lieutenant of Ithica -castle, wherein the fair Princesse Mersilva daughter unto Samor King of Bohemia was retained prisoner. But leaving them, I mean the aforenominated Plivio and Mersilva , to the protection of fortune, we will for a whiles entreat of Thalmo and the Princesse Athelia . of translucent Ph aebus , when the Flora -flow'rs were displaying the pride of their beauty, and the melodious Birds on the verdant bushes straining forth their melody) it chanced that Thalmo being tosticated with the beauty of Athelia his Mistris, betook himself to the fields, as well to refresh his tormented contemplations, as to make the flowry Meadowes acquainted with his amorous fancies; when directing his pensive course to the verdant Forrests, he at last arrived to a spacious Beech-tree, whose Branches expelling the darts of Tytan , made a compleat shadow for all tyred passengers to repose themselves. Which pleasant umbrage corresponding with Thalmo's passions, (and so much the rather, because amiable Zephirus embelished it with his Nectar -Blooms) being over-pestered with ardent affection, he there cast himself down on a Bank of prime Flowers, and taking out his pen and paper, endited this ensuing Sonnet.  So sit thee down accloy'd with lovely care, Begirt with flames of Cytherea's fire; And to the Woods relate the taint most faire Of her which did thy youthful breast inspire: And sigh and say, Oh Beauty gay, The causer of thy mournful Lay! First shew the Trees and fragrant verdant Bowers The piercing looks of thy Athelia's eye; Next tell the streams, and dainty Flora's flowers, The sweet Idaea of her jollity: And sigh and say, Oh Beauty gay, The causer of thy mournful Lay! Then to the Sylvanes, Satyres, Nymphs divine, Depaint the glistering haire, white front most pure, Together with her beauty Chrystaline, Which did thy Paphian torments first procure: And sigh and say, Oh Beauty gay, The causer of thy mournful Lay! Nay, to the shrine of Venus stately Throne Strain forth the praise and gracious rarity Of her whose beauty made thy breast to moane With plaints and teares of Love's perplexity: And sigh and say, Oh Beauty gay, The causer of thy mournful Lay! Having thus pourtraicted out his passions, and made the Forrests acquainted with the Pr aeludium of his malady; He forthwith, as being submerged with the variety of amorous contemplation, resolved to return: But fortune, willing to smooth up his Conceits in an extasie of Contentation, so ordain'd, that his Mistresse the Princesse Athelia , with her Troop of Ladies, should trace that way. Glad of this heavenly newes, he immediately blushed, because the Celestial Object thereof ravished his capacity with many millions of delicious applauds. So as elevating his resolutions upon the wing of Honour, and investing his courage with the consideration of magnanimity, he audaciously determined to present her with the physnomie of his affection; By vertue whereof, at last finding her sequestred from her attendant Damsels, and resident within a Myrtle-bower, in midst whereof she gaz'd on a silver-Fount there conveyed by mistresse Nature; He steeling his tongue with boldnesse, and taking a manly courage in the front of his faltring Oration, (with a grace, which though gallant, took his off-spring from feare) boorded her in this sort. singular sight of your delectable self, I immediately felt my tender breast to be inspired with the endurance of a Lovers passion, in such accidental amorous sort, that mine eies ever since conceiving their chiefest contentation from the vermilion-hue of your Alabaster-beauty, (at so divine an object) hath so firmly sworne my flourishing fidelity to the celestial service of your superexcellent deity, that I utterly abandon the contemplation of other Beauty, and sincerely betake my inward devotions to the glistering shrine of your dignified perfection. The grace which I saw did adorne your comely personage, the beauty which I espied did (sweetly) bedeck your lovely cheeks, and the vertue which I beheld did garnish your soveraign self, hath so inflamed my senses with the coals of affection, that in the prime of my Constancie I am like to be rak'd up in the embers of despaire, unlesse revived by the joyful news of your Princely favour. My birth is such, as if you throughly knew, peradventure might occasionate you to render the accomplishment of my Breasts expectation; whereon I will not now descant, because the motive thereof shall not move you to tearm me by the phrase of a peevish Insinuator. But (sweet Athelia! ) if my sighs might disclose, my teares explain, my rage manifest, or my passions discover with what zealous purity of affectionate love I in heart cherish the dainty resemblance of your sacred Id aea, I not only think but resoive, that your gracious self would at the first report, not onely recompence my desert with the reward of my merits, but also repay my fidelity with the guerdon of your affection; whereof till the celestial Deity shall by inspiration partly advertise you, I wil till the period of my (definitive) humane pilgrimage, remain as constant to beautiful Athelia , as I wish Athelia should be courteous to perplexed Thalmo . Athelia here at overveiling her Lily-cheeks with a crymson taint, on a sudden, as much blush't as Diana , when she espied unlook't for Acteon : and so metamorphosing her pleasant physnomie to a melancholy complexion, (being altogether unacquainted with such amorous encounters) bending her brows, within the furrows of whose lineaments it seemed anger sate triumphant, She very sharply returned him this quick reply. or my undeserved favour so presumptuous, that thou now givest wings to thy tongue to run a course absolutely so lavish? Hath my courtesie imboldned thee to aspire so high, as now, out of sense, to sue for thy Mistresse? Hath thy idle leasure, being in my service, taught thee to deck thy tongue with the phrase of flattery? and is there no other for thee to aime at, but my self? Ah fond Thalmo ! and therefore fond, because possessed with a peevish fancy. As thou deridest my beauty, I will laugh at thy folly; and in accounting me fair, I will esteem thee frivolous. For thy birth, know, that I disdain it as nothing, and thy self as lesse: If heretofore, thou hast sacrificed sighes, or shed tears for my sake, Why, expect a recompence where there is no satisfaction to be made; and hereafter, be more wiser, to ingender the conception of the like simplicity. To be brief, refrain from prosecuting thy audacious folly, or else I will use such means that my Father shall qualifie your courage, by nipping the blossomes of your flourish estate. This thundering answer proceeding from a Princesses mouth, might doubtlesse have made many fresh-water souldiers retire for fear; but our valorous Thalmo , disdaining to quit the siege for the first repulse, repairing his sense, and furnishing his Muse with a fresh supply, very boldly (as being nothing daunted) continued his combat in this sort following: discovering my affections, I flatter your merits with a shew of derision, you greatly wrong mine honour, in respect my nature was never attractive to so base an enormity; for what I protest in words, my effects shall manifest to be of truth, against the proudest Champion which durst undertake to maintain the contrary: Therefore sweet Athelia , let not an unconstant thought so obscure your Maiden-breast with obscurity, that for my faithful affection, you tearm me an ingrateful servant: for if the flower of my love was predestinated for your alone self, why, partly seek the means to affect him, which in heart hath long since vowed to adore you, as the image to whom he dedicates the generalities of his terrestial devotions: And therefore reward me not with checks for my affection, nor with frowns for my love; but kindely repay me with a sweet consent, which at the Bar of your courtesie I daily attend. Athelia perceiving that he still directed his course to one harbour, being in a manner over-pestered with listening to his old Love, instantly framed him this bitter Answer: thinks thou shouldest at my sincere request bury the reiteration thereof in the shrine of silence, and not so audaciously presume to advance the pretence of so unreasonable a demand: If thy phrase of glozing were so unfeigned as thou makest a shew of, or thy lovely passions perfect messengers of a sacred constancy, yet my determinate desires can never be diverted from reaping the enjoyance of a single life, which I have already upon the Altar of Vesta imposed: my desires rather adore the image of chaste Diana , then adore the shrine of lascivious Venus ; rather allowing of the ones principles, then esteeming of the others precepts. Therefore, Thalmo , since my minde may not be subject to the serviles of Love, let my commands in the closet of thy capacity be a mediatrix to make thee give a solemn conge to thy peevish (commenced) enterprise. Thalmo perceiving the Princesse Athelia now pretended to shroud herself under the Cloud of a solitary Climate; by informing him, she meant to imbrace the austere deity of a she-Saints devotion: Very hastily returned her this sudden Reply. affection; I should then account my self most happy, whereas now I esteem my fortunes most unfortunate. Unfortunate, I may well say, in that the Id aea of my fidelity is (without desert) obscured in the vaporous mist of incredulity; which if (without partiality) you would sincerely poise in the scales of reason, I assure my self, the zeal of my vertuous constancie would evacuate the residence of your mistrust, and as absolutely advertise you that my love is graciously sprung from the exact soile of fruitful fidelity. Whereas you demonstrate, that your pretence is to live solitarily, without accepting the society of any; Why, know (fair Nymph, and Goddesse of my imaginations!) that the possessing of your presence, and the obtaining of your commands, would yield me partly the satisfaction of my trembling desire: So that, (fair Athelia! ) if you please to grace me with the dignity of your Servant, it shall suffice; and upon that pleasant foundation will I futurely erect further delectable Trophies of delightful hope; And till my merits shall deserve more favour at your Princely benignity, I am resolved immortally to live and die in your service, and to attend on your sacred personage with such firm fidelity, vertuous affection, and submissive loyalty, that ( Athelia ) your sweet self, and King Brylion your father, shall one day blesse the houre of my arrival, and have just cause to acknowledge that the sympathie of our affections was predestinated to be united by the condescent of Celestial deity. Athelia well noting with what fervencie he uttered his passions, began immediately to produce some motion of debonaire pity: Yet in respect he should not conceive any spark of hope, where there was no performance meant to be effected, bitterly returned him this sharp Reply: Thalmo! If thou leavest not thy prattle, I will leave thy presence; For thy obstinate opinion will constrain me to flie thy sight, and hereafter (meritoriously) to loath thy company. It is now (more then) time to give a conclusion to thy conference, because the tediousnesse thereof doth overpester my senses in understanding it. What I have said, I mean to perform; that is, Athelia will live solitarily, and leave Thalmo to his passionate folly: And where thou desirest to remain my servant, I thereunto condescend, so far forth as thy desires aspire not to thy Mistresse prejudice. Let thy future attempts be seasoned with discretion, (for feare) lest folly overtopping thy capacity, thy downfal prove the more dangerous. Consider with thy self, I beseech thee, what my Father will say, being acquainted with thy presumption; And resolve not that he will blesse thee, but rather curse the instant of thy arrival, and (for recompence) reward thee with the recognisance of his indignation. Therefore, Thalmo , ask counsel of thy wits; Repent thee of thy forwardnesse, recall thy follies, and be penitent for thy offences: In effecting whereof I will assay with my self, not only that I may pardon thy presumption, but also that I may exempt the memory of thy crime out of the maiden garden of my youthful remembrance. Thalmo no sooner perceived that Athelia had finished her cruel Oration, but he instantly framed her this Answer: can at some times demure within the incirculets of one personage? And is it possible, that each being others enemy, they should both seek my ruine; and so in a seditious sympathie triumph o're my martyrdome? Ah, sweet Athelia! make not my fall your felicity, nor my ruine your rejoycing! But present before your sight the complexion of my Constancie, the fervencie of my Fidelity, and the regard of my Affection! Consider (I beseech you) the purity of my Pretence, the pretence of my Desire, and the desire of my Expectation! And think, that if Thalmo live, he must love his dear Athelia ; and though Athelia hate, yet Thalmo must needs love. What was predestinated for my fortune, per-force I must needs endure: yet in suffering her repulse, I in humility die, to see my fortunes checkt with Athelia's frown. Sweet Athelia! Distill into your heart the motion of pitty; and amidst the showers of your anger, let the splendant Sun of Favour evaporate your wrath! Let the dew of patience so mollifie the conceits of your cruelty, that I may (though long, yet) at last, amongst the briars of your displeasure, gather the delectable fruit of my Acceptance! Athelia perceiving that Thalmo still rejoyced in repeating his passions, very boldly interrupted him in this sort. mayest not be exempted untill thy time of innocencie be expired. I perceive 'tis in vain to disswade, where senslesse absurdity doth command; And it will little availe, where I see Exhortations are held as Toyes, and Requests obeyed as Trifles. I am sorry that I have remained with thee so long, in respect thou art blinded with a frivolous humour; which, I see, rather springeth from a fond capacity, then any way from a tormented spirit. But howsoever, it nothing availeth the advancement of thy demand, because unlawfull, and therefore to be rejected. Thalmo seeing the first interrupted him, thought now to render her le pareil , and so continued in this sort. of a tormented Lover, may gain acceptance in the contemplation of his Saint; I beseech you to grant me the accomplishment of my vertuous desire, that I may once in all chastity of marriage enjoy your sacred personage, which above the world I chiefly affect! But Athelia (as the custome of women is) resolving to have the last word, answered him, That his talk disturbed her thoughts, and his speeches her senses. And so in a disdainful humour (without bidding farewell) she immediately flew from him: when directing her pace to the Court, we will for a while there leave her, and a little intreat of Thalmo his passions: Who seeing his Athelia so sodainly departed, thereat (as being impatient with love) immediately stormed, changing his pleasant countenance to a pale complexion; and repenting the time that ever his mother Gratiana produced him into this miserable world, continually crying out on crooked Destiny, and very often sighing, as though his breast were overpestered with insupportable calamities, sometimes falling from sighs to teares, and then from tears to sighs again; sometimes repeating the name of Athelia , and then (sweetly) closing up his eyes, as though the Oracle of that celestial word had ravished his conceits with too many divine cogitations; At last desperately tracing these forenamed meadows, as though the Barque of his hope had already suffered the shipwrack of misfortune, He very pensively withdrew himself to his Closet, where to ease his tormented stomack, he resolved to write, and send Athelia a Sonnet, the Contents whereof followeth.  Athelia faire, the Image of my mind, The Mistresse of my thoughts, my heart and breast; Exile th'appearance of all frownes unkind, And all disdainful looks do now devest; Behold the torments of thy beauties power, Which peirc'd mine heart in an untimely houre. Your lofty font, the Throne of Graces faire, Amidst whose milk-white soyles doth alwayes fleet Celestial Veynes of purpled blood most rare, Which sometimes stray, and then again do meet; Hath so inflam'd my heart with lovely fire, That of all Saints your self I do desire. Your splendant haire, fine threds of natures skill, Which doth obscure the brightnesse of thy Sunne; Hath so combin'd my Heart with fancies fill, That their Idea in my thoughts do run: In such strange sort, that when I think to slumber, A thousand lovely toyes my brains do cumber. Your eyes like glistering Starres divinely bright, Do shine most faire, as having sacred power To draw all those which do approach their sight, Captives unto their beauteous prisons Tower; Amongst the rest, my selfe at first espie, Was forc'd to love, wherein I meane to dye. Your lovely cheeks within whose center spring Two dainty flowers, the Rose and Lily faire, At first espy did to my sences bring The thought (O thought!) of future pleasure rare; Which glads my soule, and makes my heart revive, When as my hope unto despaire doth dive. Within my tortured breast your sanguine sight Hath pitch'd his Tent, and sweareth there to remain, And still as Gardien both by day and night, The keyes thereof doth vow for to retaine; The faire resemblance of whose dainty view, Doth force my breast his Love for to renew. All sweet perfections, Beauty, Vertue, Grace, Which do adorn the April of your age; Do force me secretly for to imbrace, Your dainty selfe, to whom I do engage My Love, my Life, my service, constancie, My setled Faith, and firm Fidelity. Which Sonnet being ended, made up, sealed and directed; he forthwith posted to a Gentlewoman of Athelia's , named Levina , whose perfect visage promised him the accomplishment of a faithful performance; and imboldening himself to request her secretly to deliver it to her Mistresse, she thereunto voluntarily condescended; and so finding her very solitary in her Chamber, advancing her pace, she with an humble reverence effected her promise; albeit the Princesse at first made great difficult to receive it, in respect she knew not from whence it came; but at last unripping the Seales, it came from Thalmo : she dying her Chrystal visage with a Crimson blush, bad Levina depart; When bolting her dore, and casting her selfe on her dainty bed; she unripling the Seales, read the contents afore repeated, very often she perused those syllables and lines which best delighted her cerebrosity; and so kissing the Sonnet (contrary to expectation) she laid him in her naked neck, directly in that chrystal valley which her Alabaster Paps do inviron; when finding her self overpestered with many lovely contemplations, which ranged on the absent Idea of Heroical Thalmo , she at last to her selfe uttered these speeches; sighes thy miseries; thou mightest then envy (the better) the residence of thy tortures, and with preservative patience, the sweeter beare the insupportable burthen of thy tormented calamities: but alas, as the first cannot perform the one, nor the second effect the other; by so much the more mayest thou esteeme thy estate more then unfortunate; and curse the houre wherein thou didst first espie the (charmed) face of vertuous Thalmo; Thalmo , I say, whose valorous actions, heroical disposition, comely grace, and gallant demeanour hath so conquered the thoughts of thy mayden-capacity, that thou with the pale-fac'd Moon, midst clouds of obscurity, doest take thy pleasant light of conceived hope from the most resplendant Sunne; which in effect, is only Thalmo . Remember with thy selfe (nay perforce thou must remember) with what fervency of affectionate fidelity he pleaded to thy selfe for a kind acceptance; and call to mind the pearled teares, doleful sighs,  & passionate agonies, which as messengers (of faithful constancie) he sent to depaint before thine eyes the miseries of his malady; and blot not up in oblivion his wan complexion, hollow aspects, and repining despaire; which as (Authentical) solicitors, might have caused the most obdurate heart to relent, and have produced a motion of pity. But wretched Athelia ! (and therefore wretched, because Athelia ) forget not the proud repulses, sharp answers, bitter threatnings, nor obstinate denyals which thou gavest his enterprise; which when I consider, I burst into the very humor of Anger; condemning my selfe of (impudent) ingratefulnesse, in that I repayed the prime of his pretence with unkindnesse, and crost the proceedings of his hope with unmerited discourtesie: And being now alone, I must (nay will) confesse, that obstinate coynesse set apart, I in heart then honoured Thalmo , although Mayden-bashfulnesse would not permit me to discover it; and in such sort do still adore him as the (sacred) Image to whom I bind all my devotions; Ah sweet Thalmo ! none but only Thalmo livet within the common-wealth of my memory, and none but he (alone) may boast, hath conquered me with the prospect of his perfections: though at first I was proud in refusing his precepts, I will now be as courteous in accepting his proffers; though then obstinate in denying his requests, yet now as willing to agree to his conditions; and though then stuborn in not listening to his desires, yet now is as tractable to hearken to his demands. But soft, Athelia ! what Lunatick humor of folly doth possesse thy sences, or whether run thy wits a wandering without their guide, discretion? Hath amourous passion so soone transported thy conceits with fancies, or lovely toyes so instantly obscured thy Reason with absurdity, that without regarding modesty, or respecting bashfulnesse, thou shewest thy simplicity such, as the world hearing it, may condemn thee of peevish Levity? Is she which was so long courted, now become an Oratory suitor? and must she plead to him for love, whereas heretofore he prayed her for affection? Ah Athelia ! but such is thy fortune; And therefore contradict not that which the gods have already set down for a period; content thy selfe with that which is befallen thee; and herafter seek by some favourable means to parley with thy desired Thalmo , to the end that his presence may evacuate the mist of sorrow which doth so tosticate thy sences, and extinguish the birth of ardent flames, which doth begin to scorch the substance of thy fore-contented estate. The which she had no sooner uttered, but Levina her waiting Gentlewoman suddainly rushed in, as being from the Queen her mother to seek her (much marveiling where she should be so long absent) Athelia perceiving that the time had deceived her, instantly rose up, and masking her fancies (the best she could) under the shadow of (partly) a merry countenance, failed not according to her duty with all celerity to find out the Queene her mother, where being arrived, contrary to her expectation, she received this check: is it some extraordinary affairs which hath detained you so long from my presence? was your Tutor Lady Flerma with you, or else from whence came you? The Princesse Athelia (as a maxime incident to the Female Sex) being in such amorous actions, never unprovided of a sufficient excuse, extempore framed her this applausible answer: to see Fulvia the Countesse of Arios daughters Chamber; and this morning unexpected, she in person came for me; you being as then in your secret Closet, I was loth to disturb you, and so departed without Conge: for Lady Flerma , my Mistresse she was then at her devotions, and only Iffida my waiting-mayd attended me. This dulced Reply soon contented the Queene; and so Athelia remaining in her presence, we will a whiles there leave her, and return again to tormented Thalmo . Who being as it were plunged in the stream of Athelia's beauty, and almost drowned in the River of her affection, as also hearing no answer of his Sonnet, sent by Levina ; stormed in such sort, that his familiars (who being not acquainted with his passions) thought sure he would run Lunatique to dance with the skies, or else starke mad with the Man in the Moon to caper above the Clouds; for such rage possessed his sences, and such Anger overmastered his Reason, that I think he resolved with himselfe, or else vowed to Apollo to run to the confines of his wits Common- wealth; all company he abandoned, and detested the light, as Jupiter when he transcended in a cloud to dazle Vulcan , thereby to enjoy Juno : His speeches were far-fetch't sighes, unlesse now and then he would breathe forth the name of Athelia : his laughter was metamorphosed to tears, and no motion could enter the Cabinet of his conceits, but the resemblance of Athelia ; his Closet seemed to him a meere Purgatory, and his Bed a very exact Hel in conceited shew, (though not in effectual substance) his torments might be compared to the tortures of Ixion , onely excepted, that he had a more faire Mistresse in Athelia , then Ixion had in Proserpina . When he walked, the image of Athelia stood before him, whose Picture (with Pygmalion ) he adored, as the unique solace of his hearts contentation: being in his Study pensively passionate, he would suddenly arise and aske who was there? as if Athelia had been alwayes knocking at the door: From thence in a fantastical humour he would forthwith direct his course to the Fields, where most sorrowfully he would to the sencelesse Trees decypher forth the manner of his Mistresses cruelty; And again, as having offended, immeditately fall to sing a Sonnet in praise of her: and from thence, as though he had been bound apprentice to no trade, fall into another humour of recording his passions: amongst the rest (as I well remember) he once ranged into a very pleasant Forrest, and so from thence to Mountains next adjoyning, and again to Valleys, as the weathercock of his contemplations guided him; when being over-pestered with innumerable of amorous fancies, on the plain ground (where Mistresse May had naturally spread a Summer-Carpet) taking out his Pen and Paper, he there endited this ensuing Sonnet.  If walking by some stately silver stream, When as there chanceth a bloomy winde to be, Me thinks amidst that cockling vaperous gleam I presently my faire Athelia see; And if I trace upon their borders sweet, Instead of trees I still Athelia meet. If that I chance into the fields to hie To pluck a Nosegay for Athelia faire: Me thinks amid'st each flower I doe espie The sweet resemblance of her beauty rare: And if by chance to sing I doe pretend, For answer, she her ecchoing voice doth lend. If on high mountains sometimes I ascend To see the harmlesse flocks their pasture take, Me thinks from hill to dale mine eyes I lend If of my dear I may espial make; And if some Nymph or Shepherdesse I see, Me thinks farre off, it should Athelia be. From thence if I in valleys doe ekart My self to shade me from all humane sight, Or think to live in Woods alone apart, Hating the day, loving the mournful night: Athelia , as I hie, doth run before, When as my fortune hard I doe deplore. Which having ended, forgetting both pen and paper, yea Sonnet and all behinde him, (as Neptune did his Trident, when Nereus had almost found him with a Syrene) he resolved to range further into the unknown Forests. But as posting time gives a period to all terrestrial accidents, so in roving from place to place, without reaping so much as the blisful thought of one delectable applause, he at last arrived to a faire Cypres tree, where resolving to sleep, he was no sooner down, but (Love being impatient of delays) he rose again instantly, determining to depart; yet desirous to write some Ditty (in testimonial of his passions) although not knowing what to writ, he busily in his pocket search't for his Pen and Paper; but not finding it, he immediately drew out his Poinard, and there on the Bark of the aforesaid Cypres tree (with as much skil as his trembling hand could afford) he engraved (or carved) this Ditty following:  Thou Cypres tree, If once thou see My faire Athelia passe this way, Tell her I came To Print her name, Thereby my Passions to display. And let thy Bark Whereon I mark This sacred Dity of delight, Say, onely Love My hand did move In secret sort it to Endite, And without feare, Doe witnesse bear. On bended knee, I doe protest Whiles death shall give Me leave to live, To weare her Pourtraict in my breast. Which having ended, he very often kist it, as if there remained some figured resemblance of his Mistresses perfection. And so leaving the Fields, he again returned to his melancholy Cel, where busying his brain about his Mistresses beauty, we will instantly leave him to the fancy of his affections, and a little entreat of almost forgotten Palma . (wherein the beautiful Mersilva was detained prisoner) did, as having his heart inspired with pity, grieveously sorrow to see Porus his Captain so rigorously entreat her: For whereas King Brylion did allot her a comely Chamber, a pleasant Arboury, a correspondent Diet, and a Damsel to attend her; He on a sodain withdrew from her all these aforenominated priviledges, placing her in a very obscure Dungeon; where the thought of so detestable a Damp might have driven Alexander himself into the labyrinth of conceited despair: For, in stead of a Garden for her walk, she had only the liberty of her Close- prison; her Diet being of a homely fare, and that scarce enough to content nature; And in stead of being attended on by some Lady, very basely served by an ugly Ruffian, in the furrows of whose angry browes it seemed envious wrath sate triumphant, having from his Captain a strait command to hinder all those which (in her distresse) should aim to succour her Mersilva perceiving her self to be bolted up in this unmerciful prison, (as a Climate contrary for her Complexion to endure) exclaimed on Fortune, deploring that ever her tender years had attained to the sight of so dismal aspect! But well might she weep, and having wept, return to weeping again, because there were no spectators of her lamentation! And well might she lament, and having lamented, sigh again, because there were none to solace her in the depth of her perplexed miseries! For if at any time she bemoaned her self to her rigorous Keeper (with applausible reasons to enduce him to pitty) she was forthwith check't up with a Dictionary of reproaches, alledging that her entertainment exceeded her mertis. Which as a second wound, though the first deadly, did so transport her reason to the profunditie of compleat anguish, that with wringing hands, and throbbing sighes, as walking in her Citadel of despaire, she to her tormented self breathed out these speeches; cause to acknowledge how inconstant Fortune doth at her pleasure conduct Princes to the top of prosperity; and immediately changing humour, and turning the Needle of her Compasse to another point, doth violently tear the Bark of their former estate against the dangerous shores of future perdition, where suffering shipwrack, the memory of their happinesse is immediately submerged in the unmerciful intrailes of tyrannizing misfortune. Amongst the rest, ah unfortunate Mersilva , thou mayest of that Camelion tragedie term thy self a principal actor; because the subject of thy present misery, hath already as a Prologue, accidentally mounted the Theatre of destruction: Most wretched Mersilva! when the memory of thy birth doth (through the Chaos of thy conceits) pierce to the thought of consideration; And comparing dignities past to calamities present: what terrour of aggravation it doth profer to thy hope, thou mayest (since knowing) well coniecture; whereas others (therewith unacquainted) can scarcely presuppose. Ah, desolate Mersilva ! how are thy delicious delights now transmutated to melancholy contemplations! Thy pleasant pastimes diverted to doleful mourning and thy sweet sports metamorphosed to sorrowful disconsolations! Ah, sure it is, (and therefore sure, because ratified by the gods themselves) that glory doth fade, as well as flourish; beauty die, as well as domineere; and honour wither, as the flowers of the field, which no sooner sprout, with Titan , but die with Cynthia . What then is the world, but a labyrinth of perplexities? What then is dignity, but the seat of ambition? And what is glory, but the throne of superbitie? Ah Mersilva ! but such is the course of this terrestrial diadem, That being produced in sin, we prosecute in folly; and never forbear to detest Virtue, before ingulf'd in the Stygian stream of Vice. Therefore account thy miseries, as a recompence predestinated for thy fortune; account thy torments, as a reward sent for thy sin; and lastly, term thy calamities, as a meritorious affliction, projected for thy misdemeanour. Which doleful speeches she uttered with such zealous fervency, that the report thereof would have caused Disdain her self to have pittied her; for sometimes she walk'd (like mute Progne ) in her miserable cottage; and then instantly threw her self on her Bed of care, where drawing her Curtains close about her, one might well deem it to be a Tombe, and her self a dead Corps therein interred: when again, reviving her spirits, and remembring her misery, she would sorrowfully smile; and instantly rebuke her self for committing so comical an offence. Her Holland-Handkerchiffe (resembling the Caystrine Swans for whitenes) she often wash't with pearled tears (which distilled down the soile of her sorrowful cheeks,) and then imediately dried him with fanning winde on her face to arrouse her spirits: in which sorrowfull sort she most grievously past the day, without being comforted by the assistance of any; untill at last, the exclamation of her mournful complaint (by good fortune) arriving to the understanding of Princely Plivio , drave him to so instant a humour of relentation, that knowing her to be a Princess most royally descended, as also innocently imprisoned without committing any crime or scandalous malefaction to the Crown or Kingdome of Zanfara : he being vanquished with debonaire pity, burst into these terms; Mersilva should endure imprisonment, thy self being present? or, can the dignity of that (divine) Sex obtain no more favour at thy hands, where thou mayest by vertue of thy power bear sway? Are thy senses so mask'd with obscurity, thine eyes so obscured with impiety, or thine heart so fraighted with cruelty, that her tears cannot (to thee) sufficiently sollicite for her freedome; or her complaints, as advocates of her innocency, perfectly plead to thee for her speedy enlargement? How may the world blame thee of ingratitude? how may thy conscience accuse thee of rigor? or, how may thy thoughts condemn thee of tyranny? when the odiousnes of thy (impudent) fact, shall (with the wind of report) arrive to the barre of (unpartial) discretion; where thy faults being descried, and thy follies disclosed, what colour of correspondent argument canst thou alledge for thy excuse? or, what mask of sensibility canst thou produce to orevaile thy inhumanity? Ah Plivio ! consider with thy self in reason (unlesse exempt of all reason) from whence thou art extracted: if thou say (as thou canst not deny) from the loins of a woman, how falleth it then out, thou differest from so temperate a nature? or, if thou alledge thy father to be a Centaure , or thy mother a Prisciraxe ; no marvel thou art so perfidiously enclined to their devillish disposition. Ah, Plivio ! recall thy senses to the throne of Pity, and drown the rigorousnes of thy conceit, in the vast gulf of oblivion: Let thy thoughts before thine eyes beare the Banner of lenity; and let the Ensigne of remorse pitch his Tent in the Campe of thy cogitations: and, ungrateful Plivio , resolve, that to succour the distressed, is a point of good nature; and to assist a tormented Lady, is a fact condignely worthy commendation. What though Porus thy Captain hate her? is it therefore consequent that thou shouldest loath her? No Plivio , no, let not the suspicion of inhumanity obscure the appearance of thy benignity; nor let the thought of perverse impiety drown the apparition of thy flourishing affability; but rather let thy (demonstrative) actions savour of courtesie, and let thy resolutions be tempered with charity; so shall thy contemplations be established of the Saints for meer bountifulnesse; thy conceits accounted of all men for gratious benignity, and thy debonaire nature of the gods themselves esteemed for blisful Piety. Upon the ground of which applausible resolution, pricking forwards his breast with the animosity of honour, he very resolutely determined to visite Mersilva . So that giving wings to his courage, and liberty to his resolution, he immediately directed his course to the place where she sorrowfully lay imprisoned: where he was no sooner entered, but he might forthwith espy her mournfully sitting on her Bed of misery, having her face overvailed with a sable skarfe, as if she partly loathed to see the appearance of delightsome Phoebus ; when not securely sleeping, but rather dolefully slumbering, being by his pace aroused from her pensive contemplations, she forthwith elevated her selfe from her seat of sorrow, and ruffling aside her skarf, discovered the whole substance of her singular Visage (as the most faire Phoebe being released from the obscurity of the darksome clouds) from whence her radiant eies displayed their splendent influence as fixed Stars divinely seated in the (beautiful field of) celestiall Element, so she attending his comming he boldly approached her (where with an humble reverence) after he had most courteously saluted her, he borded her in this sort. guilty offender to crave pardon for my forepast crime, (in that I which within this Castle may something command, have so long defered from affording you consolation:) But sweet Mersilva ! my Captains command was the Rein that (inhumanely) with-held me from prosecuting my pretence; who being now departed to the Court, if you please to walk into the Fields (or Gardens here next adjoyning) to recreate your selfe in taking the fresh ayre, I will accompany you, assuring you that if this Castle possesse anything which may pleasure or serve you, you shall not only command it, but my (voluntary) assistance likewise. Mersilva seeing this (unknown) Gentleman proffer her such kindnesse, dying her chrystal Cheekes with a Vermilion blush, (which it seemed Hope had of purpose instantly sent her) very courteously returned him this applausible answer. brim of despaire) being now by the wind of your benigne newes again infused within the stream of consolation, doth for this your debonaire courtesie render you many millions of affectionate thanks; and, gracious Knight! since of (unmerited) kindnesse you proffer me this sweet comfort, I will not deny your (Nectar) demand, but account my selfe fortunate to enjoy the ayre of the fragrant Fields. Plivio perceiving how exceeding glad she was to signe her prison a general acquittance, (and again how willing to walk into the gardens) kissing his hand, and very kindly taking her by the arme, he conducted her by a Postern gate (through the Castle) to the Fields, and from thence to the Arbours of pleasure: where Mersilva delighting to range from Bank to Border, and from Fountain to Bower, leaving in a manner no place therein unprospected, she at last arrived to a very sumptuous Cistern; whose wals being of cleer glistering Alabaster and shining Marble, gave such a compleat grace to Mersilva's (partial) eyes, that her spirits at so pleasant a prospect did then receive the long lookt for motion of delightful contentment: so as at last hearing the discent of some issuing stream (which as it seemed made a musical accord, in falling to the concavity of the earth) she (taking her eare to be her guide) began to trace about the circumference of the aforesaid Cistern, where she forthwith espyed on the eastern-side therof (some Ell distant one from the other) two stately Pillars of Dove-white Ivory, being very curiously carved and begirt about with divers spacious guards of refined Azure, wherein were enamel'd both lovely Roses, and splendant Starres of most beautiful and artificial ingeny; on which Pillars tops stood two female Images most industriously painted, well resembling the Graces, each holding in their outward hands a little Vane, whereon on one side was painted Minerva , and on the other Diana ; and joyning their other hands (which they elevated over their heads) did support the third Grace, being Crowned with an Olympian Garland, holding in both her hands a Table of Celestial hue, seated in a frame of illustrious Argent, from out whose sixe globie Paps resembling for whitenesse the snow which doth imbrace the Pyrenian Mountains, rushed forth cleere Chrystal spouts of silver water; whereat she being with too much joy for a whiles ravished, at last perceived (betwixt the two Pillars) a pretty conceited Geometrical dore therein to enter, where entring, she saw a small Mountain in forme of a Pyramides, which did attain unto the top of the Cistern, from whence Nature (being by divine instinct commanded) did yeild forth full many a Veyne of weeping water, which by degrees distilling down the Rock, was lastly through Pipes of Silver by ingenious art, most curiously conveyed to the Graces Paps, which Mersilva seeing (and shutting the doore) resolved to depart; but by chance again thereon reflecting her sight (as unwilling so soone to take her farewel) and glancing her eyes at randome upon the perfection of the upper Grace, she (either deluded with a shadow, frumpt at with a fancie, or how I know not) immediately conceived that she saw her artificial eyes naturally reflect in the model of their influence, and so being in conceit induced that it was so, or else thinking that at the request of some second Pygmalion, the Goddesse Venus had with life likewise inspired her; She resolved with her self that the said Grace (although how she knew not) had interiorly some lively feeling of natural sence, and applying it as the illusion of her fantasie drave her, conjectured that she invited her (more neer) to approach. In respect whereof, mounting a step which stood (very close) before the Graces , she thought of them, but especially of the uppermost, to have some secret conference: where being elevated, she forthwith forgat herself, (as if some sacred Deity had so before predestinated it) and after was instantly put in mind of her doleful calamities; whereat much lamenting, she blushed with shame, in that she had committed so sottish an absurdity: when looking about her, and not seeing Plivio there, espying the blew Table which the Grace held in her hand, she from out her golden haire drew her glorious Head-pin, and so essaying and finding the stone tractable, (recalling her Muse to her sorrowful humour) in fair letters, Ala Romanisto , she thereon indited this Sonnet.  Fortune is frail, and changeth with the wind, Riches do fade, and Beauty soon doth flie, Honour is drosse, and Glorie now I find With Times instinct doth in oblivion die. What then is Riches, but a Summers shower? What then is Beauty, but a Winters-blaze? What then is Honour, but a Withering-flower? Or what is Glory, but the worlds amaze? Riches and Beauty, Honour, Glory, all, Are they not subject to Times deity? Yes, time doth cause their splendor for to fall At the assignment of his Soveraignty. Whiles thus Mersilva was overviewing the pride of this sumptuous garden, Plivio commanded a very gallant banquet to be there prepar'd; the which most kindly in an Eglantine-bower he presented her: And to make her Cates seem the most pleasant, he so ordained, that a Consort of Lutes, together with three tender Eunuchs, should (in her hearing) warble forth melodious harmony. So in this delectable manner for a whiles they deluded the time, wherein Plivio never failed to glance his eye on the sweet Object of Mersilva's Beauty; the which Cupid (at unawares) espying, immediately bent his Bow, and let flie an Arrow, headed with Desire, and feathered with Affection; which so forcibly hit Plivio to the heart, that he immediately fainted at the stroak, so that now he acknowledged no Goddesse but Citherea , no Saint but Venus , nor no Lord but Love: so that his breast being penetrated with the influence of amorous contemplation, after having reconducted Mersilva to the Castle, he hying to his Chamber, alone to himself breathed out these speeches: hath Cupid such power at the first approach to penetrate thy breast with affection? Can thy resolutions, which were devoted to Bellona , now stoop to Venus , and so make (Laurel) Garlands in her praise, whereas heretofore thou disdainedst her society? what, wilt thou fondly imbathe thy Capacity in the stream of Amorous contemplation, and so (albeit to thy prejudice) devote thy Oraisons to the Altar of Love? Beware, Parma! The Syrenes have sweet voices, yet deceitful; The Panthers fair skins, yet infectious; and the Amazons beautiful faces, yet meer dissemblers. What? Helen was fair, yet a Wanton; Thais was lovely, yet lewd; and Simiramis , though curious, yet a Courtisan. But alas, Plivio! One matter maketh not a Maxime; nor doth forepast examples include generall actions: For speak without partiality, and thy Conscience will plead, that as there hath been a wanton Helen , so a wise Calliope ; As a lewd Thais , so a chaste Lucretia ; And as a vitious Semiramis , so a vertuous Susanna: Therefore, Plivio , retire not with shame, but advance with valour; (For as the Poets report, Faint heart never pluck'd fruit from the tree of Love:) Consider, Plivio , with thy self, what Mersilva is; and then as in the Mirrour of Verity, thou shalt perceive her to be, of Descent a Princesse, of Qualities a Queen, of Beauty an Angel, and of Perfection the onely Phoenix of her Sexe. Who then, but would like such a Virgin? who then, but would love such a Paragon? Nay, who but would (upon the altar of Humanity) sacrifice his life in the behalf of so sweet a Saint? Thus embathing his Capacity in the ( Nectar ) Aganippe of Amorous contemplation, and solacing his senses in the ( Tempe ) stream of Mersilva's Beauty, he remained so tosticated in conceit, that no plaudite could please him, but the Idea of his fair Mistresse; no thought content him, unlesse sprung from her majestical vertue; nor no imagination delight him, unlesse derived from the pure Model of her rare perfection: So as burning with desire to display his pretence, he at last with a trembleing resolution indited this Letter, which (by a trusty Messenger) he sent to faire Mersilva , the Heavenly Queen of his Humane imaginations.  power of Cupid was peevish; the Instinct of Love, lewd; and the Influence of Cytherea vicious. But now, deare Mersilva , (and therefore deare, because Mersilva ) having sent the eyes of my Capacity to range upon the superexcellent soyle of your Beauty, and finding the Model thereof to be repleated with the physnomie of Majestical grace, I was instantly so surprised with a Favourable censure, That abandoning my former invective cruelty, I forthwith bent my devotion to the Altar of your flourishing excellency; Wherefore, amorous Princesse! since I repose the prime of my delight, in contemplating upon the Idea of your rare perfection, and derive my cheifest solace from the lovely Index of your angelical Personage, by so much the more seek to counterveile my love with the recompence of your friendship: and let an applausible answer be the (meritorious) guerdon of my constant fidelity. I will not in depainting my passions, seek to tosticate your conceits with (the prolixitie of) a tedious Epistle; because the report is, Many words umbrage desimulation: therefore sweet Angel of my breast, and goddesse of my cerebrosity, (I beseech you) penetrate your capacity with this brief principle, that Plivio must perforce either affect Mersilva , or hate himself; and ever account Mersilva till eternity to be the (divine) Saint of my soule; to whom all my terrestrial actions must maugre the effects of fortune be devoted. Till death and after, your constant Servant, PLIVIO .  Mersilva having received this Letter, and knowing from whom it came, without any disdainful coynesse unript the seals, and reading it with a variable countenance blush't; because the method thereof tasted of love, the which she had no sooner done, but fetching a sigh, she instantly found her senses beset with many agreeable conceits of Plivio's perfection: Every line seeming to make a smooth path way for Cupids entrance: But at last, daunting her Paphian sparks with a modest countenance, and considering the courtesie which he had before shewen her, she resolved to return him an answer, the contents whereof followeth.  difficulty, because I thought therein to finde ouely the appearance of your welfare; But unripping the seals, and perusing the substance, I (contrary to my expectation) found your lines to be repleted with the phrase of amorous fancy; wherefore I repented me of my audacious fact, as having committed a rash offence; and blamed my hand for having intermedled with so prejudiciall an affair: But again, weighing the former courtesie which you have presented me before the view of my contemplations, (albeit undecent for my sexe) I thought it agreeable to return you an answer: The substance whereof, is to request you, to give a solemne Conge to your commenced enterprize; because the thought of affection cannot lodge within the center of my breast; neither can my cogitations stoop to your shrine of distastefull love. Forbeare therefore the writing of more frivolous Letters, because they are motives which molest my imaginations; and cease suing of her, which till death intends not to be won by any: In stedfast hope whereof, without omitting thanks for your former courtesie, I rest Thy friend (if the enemy of amorous affections) MERSILVA .  Having thus finished her Letter; she stood in doubt to send him, fearing, lest the receit thereof might redound to the disadvantage of her fame: But at last, sounding the depth of her affection by the mutability of her fancies, and the foundation of her love by the allurement of her liking: And finding her self to be inspired with the flames of Cytherea , she instantly resolved (despight all contrary opposition) to prosecute her purpose, by vertue of which resolution subscribing to her Letter, she forthwith delivered him to her Page to convey him to Plivio ; who as a diligent servant made speedy way, that in short time he arrived to the Palace, where Plivio was as then resident, and being brought to his presence, and unvailing his Bonnet, he forthwith accomplished his Ladies command. Plivio , not knowing from whom it came, very busily unript the seals, and so without further prolixity of literature-introduction, he directed his sight to the Signers name; where finding the consonants of Mersilva to be charactered, whether his thoughts were then obscured with divine conceits, or his breast replenished with many ravishing contemplations: I refer the censure thereof to those Gallants which have likewise enjoyed the essence of the like sacred tenuity: Yet sure I am, that the sight of this divine present did not onely solace our dispairful Plivio , but likewise infused a sudden encouragement to his tormented malady; that imbracing the Epistle in his hand, he very often kist the Nectar-oracle of Mersilva's name, and with many pearled tears, seconded with affectionate sighs, instantly paid thereof the Bien veneu . But at last, calling his thoughts to a reterat, and sounding the drum of Discretion to refresh his senses, he orderly mounted the steps of the Letters preamble, and so with the Sun again descending, overviewed sincerely thereof the substance; which being not contrived to his humours complexion, nor complotted after the fashion of his distempered fancy, he instantly raged and stormed, as if the demonstration of his fumes were to be presented upon the Theatre of folly; sometimes he would stamp, and in a moment stare, as if his brains had been besotted with a lunatick frensie; then curse Cupid because he was contrary to his enterprise; and yet instantly yeeld many millions of thanks to gracious Venus for investing him a servant to so sweet a Mistress, when repeating the name of Mersilva , he would thereat quietly sit down and slumber, as though the Diety of that sacred word, had some charming authority to lull him a sleep; and again arise, and with detestable reproaches rebuke his eyes, because they so unfortunately anchored upon the Sand of Mersilva's beauty. The Page being all this while spectator of Plivio's tormented Passions; and knowing that it was onely his Mistresse Mersilva's refusal, which begirt him in that perplexity; instantly (leaving him to his passions) departed, when being arrived to his Mistresses presence, he failed not in the highest degree to depaint her the manifestation of the Gentlemans malady; as also the melancholy humour of his perplexed calamity. Which Mersilva no sooner understood, but being afresh inflamed with his affection, she very suddenly in her Princely breast conceived a motion of remorse; being exceedingly sorry that her occasion should administer the sparks of his aggravation: when separating her self from company, she betook her to her Closet (resolving to breath out her passions to her alone) where she was no sooner arrived, but the Princesse Athelia knocking at the doore, came to passe the time with her, as also to invite her self for that night her Bed-fellow. Mersilva smothering up her sorrows under the mask of a merry countenance, bade her (outwardly) welcome; (For her inward contemplations ranged upon the Idea of Plivio .) And so they with familiar dalliance, and friendly conference deluded the time, till Supper being done, and the skies orevail'd with the canopy of obscure night, they both betook them selves to their Bed; where both (but especially Mersilva ) slept with a watchful countenance, (as having their conceits tracing upon their Favourites perfections. Till splendent Aurora , the joyful messenger of Phoebus , had no sooner in combate conquered the vastal Night, and so given the sable Clouds a valorous overthrow; but radiant Titan transpiercing his darts through their Damask-curtains, early in the morn, made Mersilva arise; who without any noise (leaving Athelia in bed) apparelled herself, directing her course to the Fields; when circumferencing divers pleasant meadowes, she at last arrived to a fragrant Mountain; where not onely finding that the Spring did present her with a delicious umbrage, but also that Phoebus had there exhaled the Balmy-drops from the face of Flora , she very lovely (on the verdant grasse) most majestically layed her down, (having a Bush of Eglantine branches (interlaced with Couslips) in her hand, not only to repulse the Rayes of ardent Olympus , but also to keep off the Gnats and Bees which delighted to range upon the bloomy Roses of her Damask-cheeks; where pensively contemplating with her senses, she at last breathed out these speeches: affection! and how are thy delightful pleasures now diverted to amorous passions! Can the model of thy capacity, which heretofore could receive no impression, beome now tractable to receive any print? and must thy tender breast be so soon given over to affection? Which words she had no sooner uttered, but casting aside her sight, she might very plainly perceive her (unexpected) Plivio approach, whereat exceedingly blushing (because such fortunate newes incharmed her purpled blood to assemble) she immediately prepared her self to entertain him; who being arrived (as the Pr aeludium of his blisfulnesse) imboldned himself to kisse her, wherein he so exquisitely delighted, that he absolutely resolved, her coral Lips had attractive power, on so sweet a soyle to make his domestical demeur; but at last recalling his senses (though unwilling to depart from so sacred a solace) and sitting her down on a proper bank (which the Lady May had made the more pleasant, in bestowing for his recognisance a verdant livery) regarding her very lovingly, and straining her modesty by her Lily hand, at last (though affection on a long time had made his tongue silent) with a trembling Rhethorical voyce he layed his siedge in this sort. aspects upon the dainty soyle of your divine beauty, but I immediately felt my brest inspired with the suddain flames of lovely Cytherea ; the which in respect my abrupt Epistle can hardly relate, I am now on purpose come to present my faithful service to your sacred benignity, protesting that in heart I alone adore your exquisite self, as the Celestial Image to whom I bind and consecrate my earthly devotions: therefore, faire Mersilva , I beseech you to return my Love affection, my Courtesie kindnesse, and my Suit acceptance, that triumphing over fortune, I may give despaire a farewel, and so again cherish my afflicted hope, with the joy which your delectable self shall ingender in my more then joyful imaginations. Mersilva well noting with what zealous affection he pronounced his speeches, could instantly have found in her heart to condiscend to his so reasonable request, but (though transported with Love) thinking so soone to yield, were in her sex a point of imprudency, she at last framed him this answer. where the stream seemeth most delectable, it is often most dangerous; sweet words are but counterfeit shadowes for deceit; and when the skye seemeth cleere, it commonly presageth a storm: Men in these dayes resemble the pictures of Janus , which can fit a colour for every countenance, and a fancie for every favour; therefore as I will trust none, so I mean not to try any; lest reposing confidence unadvisedly, I buy repentance too deare, and so discretion comming too late, I cry peccavi out of season. Diana's maxims in my capacity are not so soone evaporated, neither will I so prejudice my quality as to account Venus my patronesse; in the mirrour of experience I daily see the downfal of divers, in respect whereof, by others harms I mean to beware. Therefore, Plivio , if thou leavest thy suit, I will perchance love thee as a friend; or, if the contrary, assuredly hate thee as an enemy. Plivio perceiving his Saint to fight alwayes under the Banner of cruelty, (as also that she held his fidelity in suspect) Having his tosticated Muse ingulph'd in the Ocean of perplexity, did a long time remain silent; but again reflecting his regards upon the daintinesse of her (excelling) beauty, he rousing his spirits, answered her as followeth. matters include future maxims: Affection cometh by destiny, not by device; and is therefore natural, not artificial; it is hard to censure of my qualities by others condions, and very difficult to judge of my affections by others infidelity; therefore because you mistrust that many circumstances overvaile inconstancy, I will cease only with this sincere protestation; That my Love to Mersilva is firm, not fickle; faithful, not fained; and so grounded upon the rock of immoveable, intire amity, that as my dayes shall demonstrate my perpetual affection, so my death shall testifie my immortal Fidelity. Mersilva understanding this his constant resolution, (as being penetrated to the quick with the dart of Cupid ) immediately blushed in such amorous sort, that she could scarce refrain from condescending to his demand; but at last danting her Vermilion complexion with a modest countenance, she briefly returned him this sharp Reply. since the theam whereon you descant proceedeth from folly; for if you conjecture that my conceits will stoop to the (alluring) bait of Love, you deceive your Hope with a vain absurd imagination, and onely with the Mastiffs of Cirum bark against the Moone. What I outwardly speake, I in heart inwardly presuppose; therefore ground the Anchors of your speech in the sands of silence; and presume not to present her with the Pils of your Love, which esteems not any way of your affection. Here perplexed Plivio was on the point to answer her Poetry. But Mersilva perceiving by the mutability of his countenance, to what harbour he still directed his course; very suddainly without taking Conge, departed; where leaving him to his perplexities, and her to her passions, we will for a while erre from their proceedings, and a little entreat of Prince M aedors adventures. of the Princesse Florina , and setled his affection in the soyles of her memory, was in the prime of his hope and entrance of his expectation frustrated by King Agenor her Father, because he utterly denied to match his Daughter with him, in respect of an ancient quarrel between M aedors Father and himself. So that M aedor seeing he could not obtain his purpose, nor so much as conferre with his desired Florina , (because the King her Father had to that effect conveyed her secretly to the Country, he immediately (perwiging his Capacity with Honour) resolved for a whiles to travel, hoping that the influence of time would raze out the residence of the Kings indignation: So as assummoning his wits to appeare before the Theatre of Discretion, he at last determined by Sea to voyage to the Isle of Madagascar , there to remain with his Uncle Duke Alphonso . But yet, if departing without Conge of his Saint, she might meritoriously rebuke him of ingratitude, he determined to send her a Letter: and so taking ink and paper, the tears standing in his eyes, he wrote to this effect.  bitter Aconitum, hath doubtlesse instigated the King your Father to bind his invective malice against our innocencie: So that (deare Florina ) I must depart; and being constrained to lose the paradise of thy Angelical personage, live I know not where in the Acheron of exact Hell; Oh Chamelion Fortune! not faithfull in any thing, but in absurd infidelity! How can I live without fixing mine eyes upon the Beauty of faire Florina ? And losing her sight, how can I demeure upon this vain Earth, without drowning my self in the brinish teares which distill from the Conduit of mine eyes? But such (fair Princesse!) is my fortune, nay unfortunate fortune, because the Gods in the Synod of their resolutions have imposed it for a period to commence my misery; nay more then so, I thinke, ratified it for a plague to impale me me within the circumference of endlesse disconsolation. But (sweet Florina! ) in what desolate place soever I erect my residence, my contemplations shall range upon the Id aea of your beauty, and my capacity ruminate upon the physnomie of your perfections: For in the Closet of my distempered breast I will establish the Image of your sweet Personage; and daily upon the Altar of Love sacrifice scalding sighes, in testimonial of my immoveable affection; Therefore, heavenly Paragon of my capacity, and earthly Queen of my imaginations, pluck up your courage from the profundity of sorrow, and resolve, that maugre the treachery of fortune, or the cruelty of the fates, I will shortly return, and despight destiny crown our amity with the triumph of contentation. Therefore, sweet Florina , till again I am blest by enjoying the celestial substance of your sacred presence, I will rest as I am (and till death mean to be) that is, ever constant to Florina , or always faithlesse to my self. Your vowed and devoted Servant, M aedor .  Which having ended, he forthwith delivered to a Gentleman of his to convey; and so at Galathio finding a ship ready to set sail for Madagascar , he immediately therein departed; where being a long time floating upon the back of Nereus , and having past the Isle of Maio Cape Verd , and Cape bone fortune , he was at last betwixt the Bay St. Anne and Isle Fernando , overtaken by a cruel tempestuous storme; which continuing a long time, forced them to stop at L'Golpho Delfei in Africa ; where getting the shore, and finding himself weak by reason of his sea-sicknesse, he instantly vowed there to make his demeur; and so taking leave of his ship-master, and bestowing his liberality upon the Company, he there betook himself (as aforesaid) to erect his residence; till at last being advertised by a Merchant of Tormano , that the Court of Zanfara was the Rendezvouz of the Flower of Chivalry, he determined thither to travel: In which journey, some ten leagues from the Court, by chance straying into a Forrest, and arriving to a solitary Cottage, whose situation in all things corresponded with his distasteful passions, he (all prepositions to the contrary) resolved there to make his abode; the better to delude the doleful time whiles he was absent from his fair Florina , (For to a Lover separated from his Saint, there is nothing so agreeable, as solitarinesse, which alwayes presents him opportunity to record his amorous passions apart.) And the better to mask his secrecie from the sight of neighbouring spectators, he shrowded himself in a Hermites weed, seeming outwardly to all passengers, the chief inhabitant of that vastall Grove; where forgetting his former dignity, and solacing himself with the remembrance of his faire Florina , he a long time lived as a man which had forsaken the alluring jollities of this fickle world, devoted his soule to the onely enjoying of celestial felicities. But Love which still pierced him to the quick (with the beauty of his Mistresse) would not so abandon this her amorous favourite, but so tyrannously intosticated his conceits with ardent flames of affection, that thinking to sleep, Cupid would permit Morpheus no entertainment; but enforced him divers times to arise, and pourtray forth his Passions in affirmation of his fidelity: where amongst many Sonnets and Elogies which he penned in memory of his absent Florina , I will not omit to relate these three following; because they are partly incident to the accomplishing of this our History. The first he framed in an Arboury adjoyning to his Hermitage, which displayes the Beauty of his Saint, to this effect, following:  The Picture of Florina faire, Within my Breast doth finely spring; Her lovely selfe, and beauty rare Unto my senses joyes doth bring. Her sweet delightfull colour pure, Unto my throbbed thoughts doth send Some hope of constant Love secure, Which dainty Love I still attend. Her constant Eyes, like Stars most bright, Doth alwyes shine within my minde. Her Lilly hew, and lovely sight Printed within my breast I find. Her cherry-Cheeks of taint most faire, In snow-white fields doth lurk and lie; Her coral-Lips like pastures rare, Doth force me there for food to flie. Her azured Veins like Rivers pure Through dainty soyles doth fleet and run, Her slender Waste did soon procure My stedfast love long since begun. Her speech most sweet unto my mind At all times ease for grief doth send; Her pretty pace, behaviour kind, Likewise some shew of love doth lend. Her modest grace, Vermilion hue, Like Claret-colour fair doth shew; Her self, her sight, and smiles most true, In love with her did make me grow. Her Beauty fair at first espie Inforc'd my mind her self to love: Therefore Florina , till I die, Most constant to your self Ile prove. The second, approving his Constancie, he coyned in his Closet, which was as followeth:  You little Birds, flie swiftly to my Dear, And there vnfold my faithful constancy: Tell her, my loyal Love shall firm appear, And whiles I live, all others I defie: Unfold my minde, and make her know for sure, Her Grace and Beauty did my Love procure. You whistling Winds, go tell my Mistresse fair, That still til death her Beauteous self I love; Disclose to her, that first her taint most rare To Cupids lure my tender Breast did move: Vow, swear and plead by right of reasons law, That first her sight my Breast to love did draw. You Sun-bright Beams of Phoebus splendant light, When with your golden Haire through azured Skies You wipe the Dew from dainty flowers bright; Go tell my Mistresse, that her piercing Eyes At first prospect did so my heart inchain, That constant to her still I must remain. You pleasant Flowers which in faire Gardens spring, Relate unto my sweetest Saint most faire, That still her absence doth annoyes me bring, And alwayes doth my joy with grief impaire: Go plainly tell that when I lose her sight, My Sun is soon obscured with darkesome night. You stately Woods, inform my Phoenix faire, That on your lofty verdant trees most tall, I have with faithful Pen, as well elswhere, Engrav'd her name which first did work my thral, And written for her sake full many a rime, In dainty morn of lady May's chief prime. You Valleys fair, in midst whereof doth run Sweet silver streams of dainty water pure: Go tell my goddesse, that my love begun, Till death, and after death must needs endure, Run swiftly, run, and swear, till final end, A thousand sighes for her sweet sake I send. The third is the description a Dream, which he in his sleep conceived to this effect:  When darksome night began to vest apace Her Ulie Mantle on the Sun-bright day; When Clouds obscure resolv'd to run their race, And with the pale-fac'd-Moon to sport and play; Lo then, even then as slumbering on my Bed, A lovely Dream ore-whelm'd my drowsie head. Me thought I saw my dear Florina faire Sitting alone in princely modest sort, Within the circuit of a golden Chaire; Where with her tears her heavenly haire did sport, In night attire, a Coif of Holland pure, Whereas she sigh'd, and sometimes slept secure. A Cloak of milk-white Damask did she beare All lin'd with azured Sattin end for end; And likewise under that, a robe did wear Of blushing skarlet, which did to me send The sight (faire sight) of Velvet Slippers pure, Wherein her naked Feet did rest endure. Her Colour pale, and yet as Chrystal clear, Did freshly shine within her Angel face; Her cherry Lips whereon delight did pear, Again did deck her hue with lovely grace; Grace so compleat, as Art can never blame, Nor once the like Dame nature may not frame. And yet amid'st her Lily Cheeks did spring A bloomy Rose of Crymson sanguine hue; Which sight unto my gladsom breast did bring Celestial joys, which did my heart subdue. Her splendant Eyes like Stars divinely bright, Did shine most faire, within my fancies sight; Sight which did force my trembling self to trace Unto the presence of my beautious Dear, Where when she saw me, with a princely grace She rous'd her spirits, yet fraughted with some fear, Began to sigh, ith' mid'st her sighes did say, Oh, welcome Medor! Feare fly now away. And then me thought, Oh! I with arms outspread Did softly take my faire Florina kinde, And laid her on her dainty maiden Bed Whereto in honest sort I alwayes lin'd, And gave her many a time a chaste sweet kisse, Which then was sole contentment of my blisse; Whereas she soon with lovely teares did pray, And praying blush'd, and blushing pray'd again, That I would then Dame Honours hests obay, And from all Venus -toyes my self refrain: Whereto at first I soon did condescend, And so in talk we both the time did spend. At last in trembling sort she faltring said, Since (Maedor) now thou hast perform'd my will, And instantly my deare command obay'd, No doubt hereafter thou shalt joy thy fill: For Jove will grant, where men aright require, In honest sort their chiefest hearts desire. Which having said, away she clean did fade Quite from my sight in twinkling of an eye, And so from slumbering sleep mine eyes soon made The fresh Aurora quickly to espie: When day was come, I knew 'twas but a Dream, Whereof the thought doth breed me woes extream. Prince M aedor in this solitary Grove led. Therefore let this suffice: That being pestered with ardent affection, he finally vowed to devote the pilgrimage of his dayes to Florina's service, and protested to adore her as the sacred Deitie to whom he dedicated the generality of his terrestrial devotions. Therefore leaving him to his disconsolate living, and his tormented Conceits to be solaced by patience; We will again intreat what befell Prince Thalmo , and his fair Athelia . devoted to cruelty, and conjecturing with himself that she triumphed of his martyrdome, being overcome with love, and fraighted with affection, could reap no rest of his Conceits, untill he was made fortunate by prospecting the object of her singular Beauty. So that resolving to speak with her, and knowing her in the next adjoyning Arbour, he boldly advancing his pace, saluted her in this sort. And therefore I am of purpose come, to know whether you are diverted from your accustomed cruelty. Athelia blushing to see Thalmo present; yet shadowing her love under the mask of coynesse, very soon returned him this sharp Answer: your old Folly is metamorphosed to new Discretion. For my part, I remain as I was accustomed; and if you the like, then as you came unlookt for, you may depart when you please. Thalmo seeing he was so peremptorily answered, prosecuted his purpose in this sort following: have been to you faithful, become now to your Deity inconstant; Or would you counsel me to divert my forepast affection into future hatred? Whereunto Athelia replied: care little for both, and for thy self lesse. Thalmo being ready to answer her, was instantly by Levina her Gentlewoman prevented, who came of purpose to attend her Mistresse; the which no sooner he espied, but vailing his Bonnet, with a sorrowful resolution he departed, raging against Cupid in respect he had predestinated him to serve so cruel a Mistris: when walking apart in a private place there next adjoyning, he espied his Saint Athelia to direct her course to the Court: by vertue whereof re- entring the Arbour, and hying himself to the Bower, he there espied a Nosegay which Athelia had left behind her; whereunto very often smeling, he at last, at so fantastical a Subject, indited this ensuing Ditty.  Say Crimson-Rose, and dainty Daffadil, With Violet blew; Since you have seen the beauty of my Saint, And eke her view: Did not her sight (fair sight) you lovely fill With sweet delight Of Goddesse grace and Angels sacred taint In fine most bright? Say, golden Prim-rose, sanguine Couslip faire, With Pinck most fine; Since you beheld the Visage of my Dear, And Eyes divine: Did not her globy Front, and glistering Hair, With Cheeks most sweet, So gloriously like Damask flowers appear, The gods to greet? Say, snow-white Lily, speckled Gilly-flower, With Daisie gay; Since you have viewed the Queen of my desire, In brave array: Did not her Ivory Paps, fair Venus Bower, With heavenly glee Of Juno's grace, conjure you to require Her face to see? Say Rose, say Daffadil, and Violet blew, with Primerose faire; Since you have seen my Nymphs sweet dainty-face, And gesture rare: Did not, bright Couslip, bloomy Pinck, her view White Lily, shine, Ah Gilly-flowers, and Daisie, with a grace! Like Stars divine? Having thus breathed out his Passion upon the fragrant Nose-gay, and yet therewith nothing applaused, continually burning in conceit, to see his faire Athelia absent, he at last, resolved to finde her secretly in her Closet: where very pensively entering, and not seeing her there, finding her Standish on the Table directly open; he on a faire Paper, which of purpose he brought with him, indited this ensuing Sonnet:  Earths onely Phoenix, Map of modestie, Angel of grace, pure Paragon of praise: Ah, from your breast now banish cruelty, That yet in fine, some hope I may eraise! Faire Saint, bright soveraign of my tender breast, Sweet Nymph, Dear darling of heavens Deity, How may my Muse with endlesse grief opprest Display the pourtraict of my misery! Ah sure, my Muse, nor yet Parnassus train Cannot relate my burning hearts desire; Because in beauties fire I doe remain, Fire, which I fear will life and breast destroy. Will lovely fire destroy both life and all? Then welcome Death, sweet actor of my ease: Ah, on thy sacred influence I call, Because thy tortures best my minde doth please. Come Death! else, Dear, invest my suite with Love; With Love which of your self I doe implore, That so your bashful sweet consent may move Jove's diety my life for to restore. Else, Minion of my thoughts, faire Saint, farewel, Farewell my joy, my breasts sweet extasie, And Cupid , to the world now weeping tell, That firme and constant to my Nymph I dye. The which having ended, he very zealously kist; and doubting whether she would for that night have occasion to use her Standish, took the Sonnet, and laid it fairly on her milk-white Pillow; where falling on his knees, and praying that his service might be accepted, he ex tempore (as having his Muse bedewed with the Chrystaline water of Aganippe ) to himself uttered these Verses.  Imperial Cupid! on whose shrine I doe present my Passions rage, And to whose Altar I resigne My faithful love, which I engage Here on my knees: I thee require, That my Athelia now may find This bashful Sonnet, whose desire Is to enjoy an answer kinde: And let his sight have perfect leave Her cruel Breast to mollifie; That my pretence may once receive Some sacred signe of amitie. Which words pronounc'd, he (giving her dainty Chamber a solemn Conge ) immediately directed his course to the Court; where he was no sooner arrived, but a superbious Page apparelled in crymson, with a lofty resolution, delivered him these prov'd speeches. Sir, Prince Almion my master, being certified of the love thou bearest the Princesse Athelia (affecting her beauty more firmly then thy self) protesteth his Valour, thy Rival; and to the intent thou shalt know his couragious determination, he hath by me sent thee this resolute defiance, which I here deliver thee. The which Thalmo opening, found to this effect therein contained:  aspiring affections; and seeing thou takest the Lady Athelia to be thy Saint, which the world knoweth I have (with Honour) so long served: My courage disdaining to digest so unpleasant a disgrace, hath by vertue thereof sent thee this defiance, Commanding thee, that as thou pretendest thy Love to Athelia faithfull, thou alone in the Castle-trench after Dinner (with thy Rapier drawn) meet me, where I will teach thy lewdnesse to crosse my Love; and make thee know, that in all things, thou hast abused thy superiour: And so expecting thy answer, together with thy acceptance, I rest, Thy mortal Foe, Almion Prince of Calexis .  Thalmo wondering to hear such unexpected news, and yet disdaining to be out- braved by any Zanfarian Seignior , boldly by his own Page; returned him this answer:  to Athelia , thou profferest me Combate; Know that my nature is such, that I disdaine, for her sake, to refuse any; and so in token of acceptance, I here with send thee my Gantlet; assuring thee, that if I live, I will at the time and place assigned meet thee, To demonstrate that my affection is such to Athelia , that whilest I live, I will dedicate my Love to her Service; and neither thy Valour (nor fear of death) shal rase her resemblance out of my memory: And so charging thee not to faile to accomplish thy Promise; I in hope thereof remain, Thy professed Enemy, Thalmo .  The Combat (as you have heard) being appointed, and the houre come, Thalmo according to his promise failed not to present himself; where, in stead of meeting his Rival Almion , he was (there) very treacherously encountered by a crew of desperate Ruffians, which (of purpose) were there by Almion placed in an Ambuscado to destroy him; who seeing they so fiercely approached him, instantly began to fit himself to defend their fury: where with a magnanimous courage he dealt such gallant blows amongst them, that at first, not able to endure his man-hood, they were generally forced to retire: but after stretching their Veins, and redoubling their strength, they very valorously (as being desperate servants) flew upon him, where they so manfully behaved themselves, that Thalmo not able to withstand their force, was glad to retire, and take the Castle wall for his defence; where he so valiantly behaved himself, that for recompence of their treachery, he made many of them bear the badge of his Cicilian Blade: but in fine, their force bearing sway, and their number masterdome, he unfortunately received many dangerous wounds; from whence such abundance of his Vermil-blood distilled, that finding his body weak, and feeling his senses faile him, thinking there was no way but death, falling to the ground, and gasping as he thought his last, he in memory of his dear Athelia breathed out these speeches:  Lo, now my blood shall testifie To sweet Athelia's amitie, How constant Thalmo did remain, When death his life almost did gaine. But now remark how fortune never faileth to assist fidelity! For Thalmo had no sooner uttered these his speeches, but Prince Plivio being there in a slumber behind a Bank next adjoyning, hearing the name of Thalmo repeated, immediately started up; and seeing the Prince his Cousin to be in danger amongst these rageful Ruffians, very sodainly (as having his breast inspired with part of his Associates calamities) stept to his assistance: where making way with his sword, he again lifted him on his feet, and so praying his Cousin to be of courage, stept to his Adversaries, where he distributed such valorous payment amongst them, that in fine they being some fled, and the rest vanquished, he triumphantly remained Conquerour: which no sooner he had finished, but with his best art binding up his Cousins wounds, he immediately conveyed him to a skilful Chyrurgion there next-adjoining, commanding him to dresse him with all care and industry; And so recovering a gallant Courser, he speedily posted to the Court, and advertising Athelia of these sorrowful news, she thereat (as being in conceit slain) immediately fell to the ground in a trance. Plivio seeing the arrival of this unexpected tragical accident, bethought himselfe what was fittest to be done; and so at last calling his lunatick senses before the throne of Discretion, he imployed his best diligence for the recovery of the Lady; which very soon he effected, praying her to be of good comfort, for that there was no doubt to be made of Thalmo's health. The Princesse being therewith a little qualified, for a whiles appeased her self; yet continually weeping to see him suffer such (painful) misery for their sake, (and knowing it was her affection which induced him to endure so desperate a hazard) bethinking how to comport her self in so tragical an enterprise, at last (shedding full many a teare in his memory) she resolved by his friend Plivio to send him a kind Letter, which as a Preservative-Mediatrix should consolate him in his malady; And so calling for pen and paper, she wrote to this effect:  resolve, it was the news of thy misfortune which hath caused my affection to put pen to paper; The which hath so replenished my senses with sorrow, that I may even right-well say, there are almost no words herein contained, but hath been bewasht with a teare, nor no syllable but hath been saluted with a sigh. Before mine eyes, me thinks, Parasius doth naturally present me with the physnomie of thy misfortune; and in the Closet of my conceit, Apelles proffereth me the Idea of thy aggrivation; which untimely tragical prospect doth so pierce to the profundity of my senses sorrowful imaginations, that I almost melt into tears, in that my obsurd occasion should be the Administer of thy prejudicial Accident. Yet, valorous Thalmo! since it is none but Athelia that is the original Actresse of thy misfortune; why, in courtesie, know that to the Confines of my power I will research the means to recompence thy affections with such friendly applausible amity, as either thou in right canst with honour ask, or I in reason may with honesty afford. In which mean time, till experience demonstrate thee what ardent zeale I have to congratulate thy valorous (and vertuous) affections, I abruptly end, continually upon the Altar of Love sacrificing many millions of penetential Oraisons for thy speedy Recovery: And so in hope thereof, recommending my sorrows to your favourable censure, I unfaignedly rest, Yours as her own, ATHELIA .  This Letter being conveyed by Plivio , and received of Thalmo , did instantly infuse such encouragement to his despairful malady, that in few dayes he recovered: And contemplating in his breast on the courteous Epistle which his deare Athelia had sent him, thought she would (or at least well might) condemn him of impudent ingratitude, if he vouchsafed not to return her a correspondent Answer: whereupon enforcing himself to sit up, he endited this ensuing Letter:  fortunately presented with the essence of your (sacred) Epistle, I instantly felt my tosticated senses to be ravished within the Lists of exquisite contentation: But at last in trembling wise unripping the seals, and perusing thereof the sweet Nectar-substance; I not only deemed my Conceits, but likewise my self to be in an extasie, tracing within the divine Eden of Elizium: so as administring that soveraign Antidote to my green wounds, I find the vertue thereof so pleasant, and the nature so delectable, that from a sickly Patient I am become a sound Personage, and from a dead Man in shew a living Saint in substance. Therefore, fair Athelia , upon the shrine of Love & alter of your absence, I not only thank thee for the re-establishing of my liberty, but also for the restoring of my life: Which benign (nay blisful) Courtesie, my sense in this world shall be alwayes mindfull to requite, and my soule in the Celestial paradise to come, never forgetful, to congratulate. The fervency of my faithful love, and the Idea of your fair perfections, doth bathe my Muse in the streams of distempered contemplations: Therefore what I omit with silence, countervaile with a favourable censure; or let passe unpolished, rectifie with a smiling conceit: So shall my Muse have a meritorious subject to acknowledge your benignity; my self a deserved instance to eternize your courtesie; and both a delectable motive unfainedly to remain Yours now and ever, THALMO .  Athelia perceiving by this Letter, that he had for that time made the Bark of his courage double the point of death, being thereof exceedingly glad, could find no rest in the Chaos of her joyful conceits, until she had fix'd her eyes upon the (desired) Object of his Personage, within whose incirculets remained her chiefest solace: So that at last finding a sit opportunity, when both the King and Queen her parents were absent, (taking with her only Levina ) she hyed her to the Lodge where she was advertised Thalmo was resident; and so being by the Lady of the house conducted to his Chamber, she very modestly opening the door, entred. Which Thalmo , being pensively there alone walking, (having his Arm bound up with a Lavender-scarf, betokening hope) no sooner espied, but he forthwith (as doubting whether waking or in a dream) went and imbraced her: where upon her Coral-lips, the sympathie of their affection was of each part so celestially united, that their eyes attractively reflecting piercing aspects upon each others sight, did (as Ambassadors of Love) in the Closet of their breast seek to confirm a mutual alliance: The contemplation whereof forced their breath to bereave their tongues of the use of parlying; till at last when an amorous blush had given Conge to that so pleasing encounter, Athelia (the teares standing in her eyes) began in this sort: therefore marvel not at my unexpected arrival: I am now of purpose come to display before thine eyes the model of my love,  & to make thy sight a prospector of my chaste fidelity; which albeit the appearance thereof hath been hitherto hidden under the mask of secrecie, yet know (dear Thalmo ) that thy forcible Vertue hath long since made breach of my maiden affections, and as the Avant-Coureur of Cupid , hath built his Tent in the proudest situation of my amorous breast. Thalmo having his ears repleated with this blisful news, and perceiving by the fervency of her method, that she spake no more then love did enduce her; very instantly, as being ravished with overmuch joy, giving her the impression of a second kisse, and softly straining her by her Lily-hand, very kindely returned her this courteous Answer: despaireful personage; and likewise caused my breast to triumph over my sicknesse, which I heretofore conjectured would not only have conquered my conceits, but also with Atropos cut off the vital thred of my life: Therefore welcome sweet Athelia , to thy sorrowful Thalmo ; and millions of thanks to gracious Fortune, for investing mine Eyes with the sweet object of your dainty Personage! But gazing on the rarity of your beauty, whither wander my conceits to erect trophes in the Aire, or Pyramids in the sky; that I forget my self so much, as not to gratifie your Love with reciprocall affection? but pardon me, sweet Athelia , and attribute the defects of my capacity to the distempered contemplations of my imbecility; and, Athelia , resolve that I will both now and ever honour you as the immortal Saint of my Fortunacy; adore you as the eternal goddesse of my prosperity, and esteem of you as the sacred image of my felicity. Athelia being ravished with the sweet cadence of these his sugar'd speeches, in lieu of his courtesie returned him this kinde reply: ensueth of custome: Therefore thy actions having cleared thee from imputation; feare not, for thy pardon is already granted: in respect whereof, advance in Love, and I will prosecute in Affection; proceed in Amity, and I will correspond in Friendship: The which to approve, take here my heart and hand as the stedfast seal of my immortal constancy; vowing before the Imperial throne of Heaven, to establish onely Thalmo as husband within the youthful garden of my tender juvinility. Thalmo esteeming himself exceeding fortunate, by the receit of this angelical reply, In congratulation of her protested Amity, returned her this joyfull Answer: applause, so repleat the influence of my capacity, that in recompence thereof; I vow not onely to dedicate my zealous devotions to the shrine of your bright excellency, but also to finish my terrestrial Pilgrimage in enrolling my self a loyal Servant upon the marble-statue of your maiden contemplations. Thus with many amorous ceremonies they firmly (each to other) contracted themselves; and in such affectionate sort, that neither the frowns of Fortune, the treachery of time, or the sugar of insinuation, should either blast the blossome of their flourishing friendship, or once daunt the appearance of their immovable fidelity: and the more deliciously to manifest their merriment, they ratified their resolutions with many heavenly kisses. So that having brought this lovely Couple to a sacred attonement, we will for a whiles leave them to the Paradise of their contemplations; and a little discourse of the strange accidents which befell the Lady Florina . Castle, was at last by Agenor the King her Father commanded to return to the Court, (all delay to the contrary set apart) wherat being exceedingly discontented (in respect the effecting thereof would prejudice her devotion due to her Deare M aedor ) she very peremptorily, as being a faithful Amator of his perfection, utterly refused thereunto to condiscend; King Agenor her Father, being advertised of her stubborn resolution, instantly sent forth Pursevants (perforce) to bring her to the Court; but she being before (by some of the Nobility her friends) therewith acquainted, assummoned her wits to a parley how she might avoid her Fathers indignation: at last, knowing there was no other means for her to escape, then to shroud herself under some Peasants Cottage, forgetting both her Princely birth and flourishing dignity, she instantly mauger all contrary oppositions thereunto, adrest her self, so that reaping an exceeding delight, to see the homely Shepheards lead their milk- white flocks to the fragrant fields, as also, to heare divers quires of harmonious Birds (at the sight of Titan ) to carol forth their madrigals, she a long time there remained, as well contented as a Damsel in her estate (opprest with Love) might: till on a day, bearing a Shepheardesse company to the Fields, directly in an evenings edge, as Phoebus was flying the Zenith of our Horizon to alight the Antipodes, and silver- Cynthia began to point out the Pilgrims to their desired rest; as these our two lovely females were returning from folding their flocks, Florina hiding herself under the Canopy of a sprouting Fig-tree, drawing out her Pen and Paper (of her Pocket) in praise of a Country life, indited this ensuing Sonnet.  Court harboureth, Pride whilest Country doth retain Instead thereof most rich humility; In Countries soyle Love alwayes doth remain, Whil'st Court doth nourish vitious enmity: Ambition still in Court doth pitch his Tent, And vowes even there to make his sole demeure, Whil'st in the Country friendly sweet content Delightfully in Peace doth rest secure. Which she had no sooner ended, but perusing it again and again, and finding no remembrance of her M aedor therein circumferenc'd, blaming her capacity for so oblivious an offence, she at last with as much speed as her tormented conceits and trembling hand could afford, in his memory framed these Verses following.  Though fortune 'reave me of thy wished sight, And crosse my Love perforce 'gainst my desire; Making my night seeme day, and day seeme night, And yet in both still burn in endlesse fire: Nay, though I flame, yet doth my soule pretend In honouring thy selfe my life to end. Though time detaine thee from my troubled eyes, And shroud my selfe from off my pale aspects, Yet in thy thought my wandering hope relies, And in thy absence writes Loves intellects: Therefore, despight of time, thy Princely hue Shall cause my maden-Love for to renew. Though destiny resolve for to compell My sense for to forget thy memory, Or think to make my constant breast expell The sweet resemblance of thine amity: Yet never shall his power me once constrain So wavering to my Maedor to remain. In fine, though fortune, time, and destiny, Would bend their force to make me leave to love, Or join in league of ragefull unity To cause me to my Maedor faithlesse prove: Yet never shall (despite their force) my minde To other Love then Medors be enclin'd. The Shepheardesse seeing Florina had now ended, entreated her to repair home, whereunto she willingly accorded; so along they go; the Shepheardesse being repleated with Country-applause, and faire Florina replenished with (distempered) amarous contemplation: but long they tript not o're the Diapred fields, (wherein remark the infidelity of Fortune!) but as they were pleasantly conferring together, they might behold a very young Stripling which hastily drew towards them, who being with running almost out of breath, to the Lady Florina uttered these speeches: hide your selves in some unknown Grove; for that there are arived to our Cottage some foure or five Cavaliers, which with diligence seek you, who have very grievously wounded my Father, in respect he concealeth your residence. Therefore delays set apart, it behoveth you (if you affect your tranquility) to flie: and, beautifull Lady, since the laws of nature and humanity do binde me generaly to aid your Sexe, but especially your self, I will, if you please, through the Woods and Vineyards conduct you; where I doubt not but you may remain in most assured peaceful security. Florina storming to see her Fathers cruelty, and yet rejoycing to behold this Shepheards courtesie, ruminating with her senses which way to wander in this dangerous accident, at last resolved to follow his advice, and so praying the Shepheardesse to accompany her, along they three hie together, directing their course to the Sea-side, which in two days they atain'd without being espied of any: but they were no sooner arived to --- a harbour-Town in the Country of ---, but they were instantly informed, that there was likewise search made for her apprehension; whereat being almost overcome with wrath, and vanquished with affection, they immediately without entring the Town crost the strand, and tracing upon the borders of the Sea, they at last, arrived to a little Creek, where espying an aged Fisher-man in his Cock-boat repairing his Nets; they after having saluted him with a good morrow, askt if he would transport them for pleasure a League on the Sea: the Fisherman demanding what recompence he should have for his pains, well-liking their proffer (and seeing his Boat afloat) thereunto agreed; so with a merry gale, which blew the Saile from the bending Mast, to Sea they went, where delighting to see the aged Father take store of Fish, as also to see the Boat dance lavolta's on the azured Seas, they in such sort deluded the time, till night being come, and then again returned. But before Florina resolved to put foot on shore, she to the antient Fisherman demonstrated her estate, and likewise prayed him (with tears standing in her eyes) to assist her in this her miserable calamity;  & for her better assurance, to convey her every day on the Sea: the old man pittying her estate, and being authentically instigated by the motives of her liberality, soon to her so reasonable request voluntarily condescended; wch course they many dayes observed, with as much joy of Florina , as if she had been now triumphing in her former dignity; till at last, Fortune resolving to adde more misery to her calamity, caused her unexpected (and sure unmerited) to fall within the labyrinth of a greater ensuing misfortune; for they so long time daily went to the Sea, till at length, being some two leagues from the shore, they were espied by a Pinace, which ranged close along by the clifts to attrap some purchase, who hoisting their Sails, came directly towards them, and so making speedy way, because the winde began to fresh, did very soon cut their Boat from the shore, commanding them to the main; which doleful sentence being to this our weak company so dreadful as the sight of the Wolf to the innocent Lambs, made them almost dye with grief to think on their disastrous misery; but especially Florina , from whose eyes distilled many fountains of pearled tears, which as the perfect messengers of sorrow, did apparantly demonstrante her insupportable grief; but all alas in vain, for there was no remedy to assist her, nor no undanted Alcides neer- hand to rescue her from their cruelty; but perforce, they were very rigorously commanded to come aboard, which with a faint courage and sorrowful resolution they effected, Florina being the last that entered, whom the Turkish Slaves no sooner beheld, but (reflecting their eyes upon the sweet object of her angelical beauty) clapping their hands, and throwing up their Caps, they exceedingly rejoyced in that they had gotten so sumptuous a prize, to present their Soldan : but all this while, the comfortlesse Florina hanging down her head, and diving into despair, thought she was now on the stage, where the catastrophe of her Tragedy should be acted. But the Captain of this cursed crew (albeit seldome seen in this our Age) discreetly viewing her beautifull Visage, did from the influence of her constant eyes and modest aspect immediately conceive that she was some vertuous Damsel, extracted of honorable Parentage; In respect whereof he discharged the rest, and retained only perplexed Florina , which he commanded to be intreated with all benigne favour and courtesie possible; And to that effect, forsaking his Cabin, he charged his Page therein to lodge her, and to attend her with as great diligence and vigilant curiosity, as his own personage: So that Florina (to her consolation) might perceive, that as they entertained her courteously, so they likewise honoured her by never presuming to defloure her of her maidenhood (which she a thousand times esteemed more dear then her life.) But again, remembering her M aedor , she would instantly weep, as if his absent Idea had a Regal Prerogative to make her water her Plants: Many bitter sighes she likewise thundered forth to the shrine of his Personage; and curs'd the unfortunate Fates for investing her with this disastrous misfortune: In her contemplation she delectably ruminated upon his flourishing perfections; but again pondering upon his absence, and her own present misery, she would forthwith burst into publique exclamation, cursing the inhumane Destinies for investing the Bulwark of her Breast with such distasteful aggravation. The which the Captain espying, began most debonairly to comfort her dispairful courage, adding moreover with the industrious art of his fluent tongue, that no disgrace or malefaction should be administred her, but such chaste kindnesse and modest courtesie as should every way correspond with the title of honour. But alas, sweet Florina , not understanding his language, could reap no applause by the anagram of his speeches; but still most bitterly bewailed her misfortune, lying prostrate in her Cell of misery. Where leaving her with the Captain of the Pinace, which resolved to transport her for Constantinople , we will commit her to the favorable occurrent of fortune, and a little intreat of Plivio and Mersilva . made acquainted with the fortunate successe which he had received in his Loves, began instantly to conceive some motion of hope, not doubting but by the means of Athelia he might obtain his desired Mersilva: Upon the foundation of which hope, apparreling himself in a white Suit of Sattin, cut out upon black Damask, (whose colour in Blazon display Purity and Sorrow) he hyed himself to the Court; where enquiring for Mersilva , and being answered, she was in company of the Queen, Athelia , and other Ladies hunting in the forrest, he immediately mounted his Courser, and with a gallant pace posted thither; where he was no sooner arrived, but hearing the shril cry of the couragious Hounds, and the loud report of the blasting Horns, he thinking the Huntsmen were on the foot of the game, being thereof a desirous spectator, but more zealous to contemplate on the Beauty of his Mistresse, he with a devout resolution made his Jennet advance; where traversing the Thickets, we will for a while leave them, and a little intreat of the adventures which befell Mersilva . Who, as before you have heard, being in the forrest with the Queen busily hunting, it so chanced that the Deer which they chased escaped from their sight; in respect whereof, the Troops both of Knights and Ladies again dispersed themselves to attrap him; amongst the rest there was present a young Cavalier named Blithion , which a long time before burned in love with the Princesse Mersilva , and could never reap any fit opportunity to disclose her the secrets of his Breasts contemplation, who sought by all means possible to sequester her from the company. At last Dame Fortune (though of Mersilva undeserved) determining with her Beauty to administer a treacherous accident, did by her Chamelion-influence cause the harmlesse Princesse to stray from the sight of her Associates, where ranging discontedly, as if her courage had been already vanquished by despair, was at last most infortunately met by this tormented Blithion , who being more then exceeding joyful of this (unexpected) news, giving spurs to his horse, and speed to his courage, in a short space overtook her, where with these unchaste speeches he impudently saluted her as followeth: millions of perplexed tortures, which the alone sight of your sacred Beauty hath engendered in my tormented contemplation: Therefore, fair Lady, since Destiny seemeth so favourable as to present mine eyes with the sweet object of your excellencie, I beseech you to grant my Affection the Comble of my ardent desire, that is, To let my Breast enjoy those heavenly pleasures of your delicate Virginity, the want whereof hath well-neer already acted the accomplishment of my untimely martyrdome. Mersilva smiling at these his fond speeches, immediately dying the center of her Lily-cheeks with a Vermilion-blush, (being altogether ashamed at his immodest conference) very sharply (as having anger seated in the furrowes of her brow) returned him this bitter Answer: Vertue, thou wouldest have tempered the Preludium of thy speeches with more discretion, and not so lavishly presumed to salute a chaste Lady in such lewd sort: But seeing thy sotish tongue hath already uttered that which may not be recalled, Know (impudent Villain) that I disdain thy suit, as the utter prejudice of my unspotted Honour, and detest thy self as the (pretended) inhumane Actor of my immortal disgrace. Therefore with speed depart, and instantly give a Conge to thy abrupt folly; otherwise I will advertise the King of thy lascivious enterprise, and instigate him authentically to reward thy offence with the deserved execution of thy demerits. Blithion , nothing dismayed at this thundering Answer, but rather more increasing the flames of his lascivious desire, instantly prosecuted his suit in this sort following: consider with your self, where you now are; for at present you are destitute from the Court, and exempt of assistance; so that your Virginity and life lyeth in my disposition: and to advertise you of my resolution, I may not be denyed with refusals, nor deluded with delayes; for despight of fortune, I must satisfie my Love, and now reap the enjoyance of my long desired contentation: therefore consent to my will, and repleat your tongue with no more coynesse; otherwise you will inforce me, after possessed of my pleasure, to use you with such inhumane rigour as my nature would scarce proffer to your lovely sex, much lesse to you, whom in heart I have ever adored as the divine Image of my breasts delectation. Mersilva greatly astonished at his pretence, began exceedingly to weep, because the sequel thereof with sorrow toucht her to the quick; still sighing and raging, as if the Coffin of her breast would immediately rent in sunder with imminent agravation, alwayes calling on the Godesse Diana , whom sincerely she prayed to revenge her quarrel, and to shelter her from the rapine of this imodest Knight: but at last considering that silence was a shew of consent; disdaining ever to stain the purity of her fame with deformity, or the Noble discent from whence she was extract, with disgrace; making a muster of her angry Muses, in the valley of her cerebrosities indignation, she very resolutely with an undanted audacity returned him this sharp Reply. reasonlesse, nor vouchsafe to permit me to depart in patience without blemishing mine honour with the spot of infamy; know, that rather then I will once consent to thy lascivious demand, or ever agree to thy lustful desire, I will voluntarily be the administer of mine own untimely martyrdome. And therewith unsheathing an inameled knife, which she had pending to her golden girdle, (as a second Lucretia ) with a fatal stroke she resolved to destroy her self: but the devilish Knight suspecting some such accident, very soone wresting the knife from her hand, prevented her purpose; the which having done (setting hold of the bridle) he immediately alighted her from her horse, whereat being overcome with feare, she in a dangerous trance fell to the ground, where metamorphising her cherry taint to a Cynthian complexion, she there lay speechlesse, as much trembling as an Infant-prisoner hearing the sentence of death pronounced against him; the which to arouse, Blithion spake to her in this sort. you,  & yet were Hercules himself present, he should not hinder me of my purpose; for my sensual ardor cannot be extinguished without accumulating the Roses of your (divine) Virginity. Which having ended, Mersilva arising on her knees most sorrowfully (with fountains of teares distilling down the soyle of her Vermilion cheeks) interrupted him in this manner: the Citadel of my Mayden breast with thy Rapier, then ravish me of that which I esteeme far more precious then my life; Erect not, I beseech thee, thy Trophies of pleasure in the defloration of my Virginity, nor build, thy golden mountains of solace, in depriving the inward treasure of my unspoted chastity. But here again the doleful confluence of her disastrous tears imbathed her faltring tongue in the Acheron stream of silence, so that that the courage of her exteriour audacity not permitting her to depaint the Physnomy of her inward aggravations, she (overvailing the instinct of her eyes with the Curtains of perplexity) lay for a while sencelesse, as if the valour of her conceits had been smotherd up in the antipathy of disconsolations; when arousing her sorrowful capacitie with the contemplation of imminent fear, she suddainly started up, and most inhumanely tore the sparkling tresses of her golden haire, wherewith dame Nature had most gloriously imbellished her; which tragical object, might ( Blithion excepted) have made the most bloodie inhumane Scythian to pity her estate; nay, have caused the sencelesse obdurate Rocks themselves to weepe, and sorrowfully to take compassion upon the spectacle of her miserable calamity. But Blithion not passing for her exclamation, but rather burning with inordinate desire to extenuate the imbers of his unsatiable lust, esteemed every Court-minute a compleat moneth, before (though to her immortal infamy) he had made proof of his superdiabolical enterprise: so that accepting of no Reason for satisfaction, nor accompting of any Imploration for payment, taking her by her trembling hand, he most viciously began to imbrace her. When being on the point to make shipwrack of her Honesty, and to set her Maidenhood to sale, lo thitherward unexpected came Plivio galloping amain; the which Mersilva (to her Nectar-comfort) espying, to him very loudly cryed out in this sort: Ah Plivio! as thou tenderest my Love, and desirest mine Honour, assist thy distressed Mersilva , and revenge the devilish pretence of this unmerciful Tigre with the merited guerdon of condigne punishment! Plivio perceiving it to be be his sweet Mersilva , instantly (as being inflamed with revenge) made his Courser more swiftly advance then the Jennets of Jupiter: when leaping from his horse, he with his Rapier drawn approaching his thrice mortal Enemy, very furiously uttered these words: Ah wretched Villain! make ready thy sword; for if there were no more men living, thou immediately dyest. Which words he no sooner pronounc'd, but in the twinkling of an eye he lodged his Rapier in his Rivals breast; where receiving his demerit, and falling gasping to the ground, Plivio first cut off his perfidious tongue which had so lasciviously pratled, and then without prolixity sent his servile soule to the Republique of Pluto , to tell Tereus and Tarquine , that he went neer to commit a lustful Rape. The which Mersilva with fearful joy perceiving, ran to Plivio , falling first to his feet, and then again arising imbraced and kist him; when after having given him many volleys of hearty thanks (seconded by many millions of penitential teares) she from point to point recounted him the manner of the Accident; the which when Plivio understood, he esteemed himself more then exceeding joyful, in that the Fates appointed him to arrive in so fortunate an houre. And so having comforted his now even comfortlesse Mersilva , remounting her on her milk-white Courser, (posting together) resolved to find out the Queen; to whose presence being arrived, sitting with her Ladies like Venus with her Nymphs, closely banquetting under the umbrage of Fig-trees, (whose spacious leaves kept them from the power of Titans influence) he to them depainted the manner of the Adventure, which mournful Mersilva testified to be of truth, by again on fresh shedding many pearled teares, which (like the clarent Dew on Damask-flowers) destilled on her sorrowful cheeks. Which when the Queen, together with her daughter Athelia and the rest of the Ladies understood, they all praising the Almighty, gave likewise incessant thanks to Plivio for his undaunted magnanimity, and exceedingly rejoyced in that the Princesse Mersilva was so fortunately preserved: when rising, they left the forrest, and instantly returned all to the Court; where they were no sooner arrived, but the Queen immediately made the King her Husband therewith acquainted; Who greatly rejoycing that Plivio the Arabian-Knight had so valorously behaved himself, did after in consideration thereof much advance him to honorable Dignities, in such sort, that both the name of Thalmo and Plivio (like the Sun of Renown) only flourish'd in the Court of Zanfara: Which adding more hope to Plivio's desired Enterprise, made him not a little glad of the accidental event of such fortunate fortunacie: For first he perceived that the King and Queen much favoured him, The Princesse Athelia (likewise) far the more, in respect of her best beloved Thalmo ; And again, he beheld his dear Mersilva to reap exceeding contentation in enjoying the Eden of his desired presence. Whereupon remaining continually in the Court, he at last in tract of time, found Mersilva solitary in her Closet; to whom boldly entring, he very amorously saluted her in this sort: What, fair Mersilva , all alone! Why, a kisse for your thoughts! To whom instantly she replied , Not alone (Plivio) for my self and I am together; And for my Conceits, I think on nothing, therefore I conjecture that lesse then a kisse may purchase them. Plivio almost ravished with joy to see her in so pleasant a humor, thought it now wisdome to strike the Iron being hot; and so by vertue of his supposed discretion, continued his conference in this sort following: deceive not my thoughts, Maidens will scarce content themselves with the like payment. To whom Mersilva again replyed; I'le prove the contrary; For if I faile not, my Muse tels me, one may kisse in conceit. I, but quoth Plivio , these are shews without substance; for there is difference betwixt pretence and performance: for the one in reason is the others contrary, as absolute as a shrewish Wife is a quiet Husbands. Whereat she very pleasantly smiling, again replyed: Why Plivio, you erre from your matter; for Wives and Husbands are not incident to our Theames. Plivio seeing her merrily disposed, framed her this pleasing answer: Surely, Princesse Mersilva , you herein prove your self a discreet disputant, in that you have put me in minde (or at least) in the plain path- way of our former purpose; for I now remember, a Kisse was our sentence; the which, by your leave, I mean to prosecute. And so imbracing her slender waste, he gave her (Nectar) lips, the impression of a dainty kisse: whereat she blushing, returned him this sharp answer: Why Plivio, I little thought you would have proceeded so peremptorily; for had I but once thereof deemed, my exact absence should have given you a precise gain-say. Plivio seeing her patience a little moved, thought to countervaile the offence with a courteous answer: And so encouraging his Muse with many amorous contemplations, he continued his speech as followeth: Why Princesse Mersilva , moved in a manner! or can the fuel of your wrath be so soon illuminated with a blast of Sun-shining! had I thought my enterprise would have so soon incur'd your displeasure, I would (assuredly) have prevented that which is now happened. Whereunto Mersilva answered; Nay, I now see this my kindenesse, which is the occasion of this distasteful accident: Therefore to avoid the like scandal, I pray, as you are come, depart; and being departed, arrive when you are sent for. Whereunto Plivio replied, Faire Mersilva, If the demonstration of my love have ingendred your displeasure, I pray you excuse affection, which was thereof the chief occasion: and if you please, for reward of my crime, inflict on me what punishment you think shall be sufficient for the offence. Mersilva hereat again blushed, but in such amorous sort, as it seemed that both love  & disdain sat in the modle of her cherry cheeks striving for supremacy: yet at last considering she had advanced her speeches so far without his affable merits, and seeing the subject so small wherein she had grounded the foundation of her wrath, she, to avoid the humour of future aggravation, instantly (without bidding Adieu) departed: where poor Plivio , opprest with love, remained so much tormented in thought, as that it seemed he had with the Greeks already seen the light of Capharia , and so the Barque of his hope was on the point to teare against the flinty-rocks of devouring Charybdis: For sometimes he would in her Chamber walk, and with his threat'ning hands menace the gods with revenge, and likewise reproach dissembling Cupid for ingratefulnesse; then immediately slumber, and in his drowsie capacity dream of Mersilva's cruelty: When rising, and premeditating upon the Chaos of his amorous contemplations, he would forthwith teare his beard for meritorious anger: In which, or the like fantastical humour he so long remained, till at last Mersilva (little thinking of him, or at least of his there being) returned; who astonished to see Plivio there present, forgetting her former wrath, askt him merrily, what wind blew him thither? Whereat he striving to abolish disconsolation, (fetching from the concavity of his heart a volley of distempered sighs) very mildly returned her this tractable answer: sorrows, and only your coynesse which hath caused my aggrivation: For since your departure, I have here remained in such discontented sort, as if you triumph not of my misery, you would condignly pitty my malady. Therefore delude my suite, I beseech you, no longer with delayes; nor contemn not my love, in laughing to my constancy: but resolve, faire Mersilva , that Plivio would willingly dye to demonstrate his fidelity, so farre forth as the tragedie of his misfortunes might make Mersilva tractable: Therefore, faire Princesse, attribute my sincere love some affection, and rejoyce not to martyr him with denial, which is ready to sacrifice his life before the shrine of your beautious Deity. Mersilva perfectly noting with what fervent zeal he pleaded for favour, did instantly as being inspired with affection, return him this applausible answer: the band of unity, hath long since in the Closet of my breast made way for thy affection, in such amiable sort, that being conquered by the aspect of thy blisful magnanimity, I in all honour (in lieu of thy kindnesse) remain thy attendant hand-maid: and albeit I have hitherto refrained my tongue in depainting you the fervency of my affection; yet impute it not to the defect of good will, but rather to the superaboundant zeal which I have had, to make proof of thy constancy: the event whereof hath fallen out so fortunate, that I now from my heart protest, I adore onely the essential pourtraict of Plivio , as the bright morning Star of my dayes felicity. Plivio well noting the fervency of her affectionate zeal, and perceiving into what strait of love Cupid had now brought her; being in conceit half ravished with the joyful alarum-bel of this unlookt for news, thinking his tongue deferred too long time in not congratulating her kindnesse with some reciprocal courtesie, very familiarly, at last, returned her this amiable answer. the flourishing ( & never dying) fidelitie which in heart I have devoted to your sacred self; I should acknowledge my capacity bound to nature for permitting me such good fortune, and account my self indebted to art, for enduing me with such blessednesse. But since, sweet Mersilva , that the coyner of my deliverance cannot sufficiently stamp the interior characters of my cogitations, nor the discoveror of my secrets enough worthily depaint the Physnomy of my affection: yet Mersilva , I beseech you believe that I have grounded my constancy upon so sure a foundation, and imprinted my fidelity upon so firm a resolution, that neither the alluring events of prosperity nor the terrifying threats of misfortune can either extenuate by flattering shews, or extinguish by frowning substance. And whereas I perceive that though long, yet at last you have banished cruelty from your breast, (and imbracing benignity) accepted me for your Servant; know sweet Mersilva , that in recompence of your amity, I present you with the Comble of my constancy, and vow that in the Closet of Plivio's cogitations Mersilva shall onely sit as triumphant governesse, where my affection shall serve her, my fidelity entertain her, my love attend her, and my never wavering constancy pay her the sweet bien venue of terrestrial blisfulnesse. Mersilva understanding his friendly answer, and solacing her sences with the assurance of his affection, typping her tongue with the phrase of favour, very mildly returned him this sweet answer. conference set at liberty, and made free from subjection in swallowing down the vitalitie of thy speeches: yet when I remember the estate of King Samor my father, I weep, in that I should so unadvisedly bereave him of a daughter; but yet the unity of our love hath linck'd me to thy affection, and in ruminating on thy vertues, I infuse his memory in the twists of oblivion: so that, sweet Plivio , condemn me not of disobedience, in being obedient to thy selfe, nor impute not the title of inhumane ignorance to my charge, in respect it is only the image of thy vertue which unites my fancies unto thy affection. And with that, she from the influence of her eyes rained showres of teares upon the Alabaster soyle of her Lily cheeks, which Plivio perceiving, interrupted her in this sort: evacuate the residence of sorrow; let the memory of our tender affections submerge the waves of discontent, and let the novelty of our friendship triumph over insinuating disconsolation. What? resolve it is the gods which seeke to sympathize our amity, and fortune her self, which delighteth to crown our friendship with contentation; Faire Mersilva , despaire is the path-way to destruction, therefore pluck up your spirits, and let a joyful countenance give sorrow the overthrow; and conjecture not that my acquaintance shall prejudice your estate, or diminish your dignity, for then were my sute dissimulation, and my affections folly; for the purity of my pretence, and the event of time, shall inform you the contrary: therefore imprint your resolutions upon the foundation of hope, and resolve that Plivio will live and dye, only to adore sweet Mersilva , as the divine Image of my felicity, to whom I consecrate the generality of my devotions. Mersilva sweetly pondering upon his firm fidelity, having almost her amorous conceits smooth'd up in the Lists of applausible contemplation, very affectionately returned him this gracious Reply. then you now promise, I in consideration thereof vow, that none but Plivio shall possesse my person, and only Plivio wil I account as the delightful Titan of my conceits, from whose radiant brightnesse I extract the splendant Zephyr of my soules contentation. affection, here take my heart aud hand in pledge of my immortal constancy, vowing before the Imperial Throne of Heaven, that my soule shall be first diverted into cinders, ere I withdraw my zeale from serving and honouring Mersilva . Thus having plighted their troths each to other, they a long time remained solacing their cerebrosities, within the Nectar Eden of applause; so that that the night approaching, it was more then time for Plivio to depart, when taking his Angelical Saint by the Alabaster hand, and fixing his aspects upon the divine mirror of her heavenly beauty, he with a sighing voyce gave her this friendly farewel: depart and leave thee to the Chaos of thy ruminating contemplations: Therefore sweet Minion of my breast, and Mistresse of my capacity, I will hie me to my Closet, and there invent the means for the establishing of our future tranquility; so that till I am again made (triple) fortunate by enjoying the excellency of your divine personage, I in all sympathy of faithful affection take my sorrowful Conge. Mersilva hereat painting her countenance with a Cynthian complexion (the tears standing in her eyes) answered him as followeth: feare lest wanting the image of thy personage, I immediately dye in contemplating on thy absent perfection; therefore, at my sincere request, satisfie my ardent expectation and in recompence thereof as I mean to live in thy gracious favour, so I resolve to die in thy vertuous affection. Thus, as the ordnance of their conceits had thundered forth many volleyes of sighs at their farewel, Mersilva (erecting Trophies in her breast) hied her self to her Closet; and Plivio (framing triumphs in his contemplation) betook himself to converse with his Cousin Thalmo , to whom he recounted the event of his fortunate proceedings, and the prosperous conclusions of his amourous enterprise; who being thereof exceedingly satisfied, askt if his Lady were contented to leave the Court and travel with him? whereunto he answered, that to the same effect he had already motioned whose reply was, she would follow him in weale and wo, in mirth and misery, in sorrow and sympathy, as far as the confines of the world would permit, or I desire. Why then, quoth Thalmo , my Athelia's fancies, and Mersilvas affections are incident to the Idea of one formosity; and hath vowed no more then Athelia could desire to effect. To remain here were folly, in respect we are absent from our native home; and to acquaint any with the modle of our affections were unfit: Therefore let us with the ingenious Bee return home in safety, and with the skilful Pilot redirect our course to the Port of our residence: for peradventure, tract of time may disclose the secrets of our pretence, and so the prime of our hopes may be by envy crost in the bloomy blossoms of their maturity, which to avoid (as before I have demonstrated) let us with haste return, and so through the Woods and Forrests convey our Ladies from the sight of any; for if the report of our departure did but arive to the Port of King Brilions understanding, doubtlesse he would so rigourously intreate us, and so severely handle us, that perchance our lives, or at least our liberties should remain as hostages for our misdemeanour. Plivio attentively listening to his Cousins exhortations, and sounding the depth of his counsel by the profundity of his own conceits; allowed well of the Plot which Thalmo had compacted for their retirement; the which, the better to accomplish, he willed his Cousin to make his Athelia therewith acquainted, as he protested to do the like to his Mersilva , to the end that when the hour of departure should be assigned, they might make themselves ready, and fit such necessaries as might be needful for their journey: upon which resolution, each departed to his Saint, to whom in the confluence of many amorous terms they dilated their purposes, and not only discovered the Picture of their noble birthes, but also the Pourtraict of their direct names; the winde of which novelty, they no sooner understood, but being (as it were) smooth'd up in the Extasie of many delicious contemplations, (the which seemed farre the more pleasant in respect of their innovation) they being compleatly therewith more then divinely contented, to their sweet demand (after many hearty congratulations) very soon condescended. By this time our two young Princes Plivio and Thalmeno , having apparent proof of each others affectionate resolutions, and burning with desire to set forwards their enterprises, instantly appointed that the next night following (at the outward Gate, betwixt twelve and one) they would attend the thrice happy arrivals of their sweet Saints; which warning, though short, seemed so sweet to their Ladies imaginations, that (applause building trophies of content in their trembling resolutions) they very pleasantly deluded the time in familiar dalliance; till at last, the hour (as they thought) being come, and their Princes absent, metamorphosing their mirth to melancholinesse, and their joy to discontent, they began to blame them for too much (unmerited) constancy; sometimes condemning them of ingratitude, and then again instantly with a sigh recalling their speeches, fearing lest the influence thereof might by some unaccustomed accident be transported to their favourites understanding: Sometimes exclaiming on their own fortunes, in that they saw fortune herself began to temper the preludium of their loves with distasteful misfortune. But alas, these amarous Ladies were both deceiv'd! for the Dial of their cerebrosities told the hour of assignation before the horologe sounded, and the clock of their conceits struck twelve and one, e're the essence of ten, farr lesse eleven, was in election to be finished; yet in such sorrowful sort they past the time, till at last (and not unlookt for) their two Princes arrived, giving a shril hola, which between this amorous troop served for a watchword; the which the Ladies to their delight no sooner heard, but instantly (as understanding the sentence of freedome pronounced to their imprisoned contemplations) giving courage to their thoughts, and dying their milk-white cheeks with a vermilion blush, they in their night- apparrel descended; the glimpse of whose glorious appearance our two young Princes no sooner espied, but advancing their pace with exquisite delectation, they went and saluted them, where so joyfull a meeting of divine sympathy was betwixt them demonstrated, that forgetting their senses, and almost themselves, I thought they would for that night have made their amorous demeure upon the Lily incarnate soile of their coraline lips; no words could they utter, because their tongues were (by love) devoted to silence, and such as past, were clamorous volleys of sorrowful sighes, which redoubling each on other, strove which should first unite each others heart with the sympathy of superabundant affection. But in fine, yea, and in the twinckling of an eye, they heard in the Palace a fierce and terrible noise, as if in a manner the whole Court had been in a seditious uproare, which repleating their senses with fear, and replenishing their conceit with timerosity, drave them all into a very effeminate humor of exact dispair; in such sort, that they knew not how to save themselves, nor where to convey their Majestical Ladies from the gurmandizing jaws of ruthful distresse; till at last, Thalmeno knowing their estate fickle, and perceiving it now stood upon him desperatly to cast at all, (I mean either to lose his own life, or his dear Athelia , which he esteemed far more pretious) refetching the courage of his undaunted magnanimity from the confines of feare, and arming the interior lineaments of his valorous capacity with animosity, he to his trembling associates pronounced these speeches. martial courage lead forth thy Lady,  & if any (though Hercules himself) presume to stop thy passage, sheath instantly thy Amazon-Bracamard in his perfidious breast, and so without prolixity send his servile soule to the common-wealth of Pluto , for a more then meritorious sacrifice: And you illustrious Ladies, feare nothing, for the Physnomy of our persons shall be a sufficient Bulwark for your preservation. Which said, arme in arme (like Apollo and Diana ) along they go, without finding any to resist them; and seeing the Porter in his Pavilion asleep, very cunningly took from him his keyes of the Palace; when unbolting the outer gate, they without making any noise issued forth, where they were no sooner come, but they found their Pages each with their Jennets attending them: glad of this newes they (taking their Ladies behind them) mounted on horse-back, and so as fast as the Steeds of Jupiter galloped through the streets, where in a short time, having past both Town and Suburbs, (the obscure night still seeming to condescend to their pretence) they at last (having cherished their Ladies with many comfortable speeches) began to consider what course to take: So that assuring themselves, the King finding the Princesse lacking, would with all possible celerity make speed for their apprehension, they finally resolved to gallop through the woods and Forrests, the better to shelter them from the sight of avant-Coureurs (if any such there were which presum'd to follow them) by vertue of which predicted resolution, they made that night such speedy way, that before the morning (or at least ere golden Titan domineered in the silver element) they found themselves very neere twenty leagues from the Court. Now to make any long discourse of the sorrowes which the Court of Zanfara received, or any ample relation of the Troops of magnanimous Knights sent to seek them, I think it needless, at least I omit it, because in my capacity my Muse terms it superfluous. But howsoever, our Troop of lovers were so far, that they now knew themselves out of confines of danger: And therefore to proceed with their future adventures, the next morning as they were swiftly riding by a Forrests-side, they through the branches (which were apparelled with a Summers vesture) might espie a very pleasant Cottage; which both Athelia , and Mersilva desirous to enter, requested their Princes to alight, and accompany them, who glad in any thing that might procure their Ladies delectation, thereunto condiscended; so leaving their Pages with their horses, they enter the Forrest, directing their course to the Cottage; whereto they were no sooner arrived, but thinking to find some shepheardesse, instead thereof beheld a very beautiful young man, (which seeming to be overcome with sorrow, shadowed the vivacity of his countenance under the wrinckled mask of a discontented visage) sitting very sorrowfully slumbering on a verdant bank, having a Book, Pen, Ink and Paper close by him; which hearing the sound of their voyces, rousing up his spirits, came, and in this sort saluted them. to be) admire not at my sorrowes, nor wonder not at my disconsolation; for it is powerful fortune which hath invested me with this miserable calamity: in respect whereof, to evacuate his tyranny, and to triumph over his usurpation, I have here solitarily withdrawn my selfe into this Grove, of purpose to live, though not so well contented as I could wish, yet so well pleased as a man in my estate may: my Rural Cottage affords no Cates, but poverty; yet as it is, if you please thereof to accept, I will account my self most fortunate, assuring you that what there wanteth, good will shall countervaile. Our Princes and Ladies perceiving the humor of his benignity, and the nature of his kind proffers, thinking their capacities far indebted to his bountifulnesse, very friendly by the tongue of Prince Palma , returned him this amourous answer. pleased you to afford us,  & the displays of amity which you have now demonstrated us, doth so make the Idea of our gratulations run into instant admire, that we find our selves so far ingaged in the bonds of arrerages, as we absolutely hold our imbecillities such, as our tongues cannot at present repay you with a condign recompence for your un merited courtesie; neverthelesse, according to the actions of Reason, and rules of amity (albeit a guerdon far insufficient to countervaile the motives of your benignity) we return you very hearty thanks for your proffered courtesie, assuring you that if ever any favourable subject presents, wherein (in honour) we may partly requite your kindnesse, you shall find us generally willing, and so willing, as the effects thereof shall term us to be no amators of ingratitude, but rather favourers of debonairnesse. Which no sooner was pronounc'd, but the stranger taking the two Ladies by the hands, requested them, as also the two Princes, to enter his hermitage: where in the best manner he could, he presented them with a dainty collation of dry Figs, Dates, and Apricocks, with other such fruits as the foyle of that Country did afford; which being ended, he to shew the Ladies the more pleasure, demanded if they pleased to recreate themselves in the Arbour, whereof being surpassing joyful, they very willingly agreed; and so hand in hand with the Princes, the stranger shewing the way, forth they went; where passing through a fragrant Alley beset with Fir-trees they at last attain'd the entrance of the garden; where they were no sooner arrived, but the two Princesses after having viewed the treasure of the oderiferous flowers, and perused the wealth of the fragrant hearbs, they to avoid the bright ardor of the splendent Sun (because a professed enemy to their Angelical beauties) with as much celerity as modesty could permit, betook themselves to the Bowers, where their beloved Cavaliers with triplicity of divine kisses failed not (chastely) to pay them their courteous welcome: the stranger viewing their amorous familiarity, suddainly wept, as if the object thereof had some Regal prerogative to make him water his Plants; in respect whereof, to smooth up his contemplative sorrowes under the Mask of a merry countenance, he instantly hyed him to the Cottage, and returning speedily, brought with him a dainty harmonical Lute; the which after having tuned, (thinking to delight their curiosity with the rurity of his melodious musique) he divinely warbled out a ravishing Lesson, and thereunto contracting his clarent voyce, he sweetly uttered this ensuing Sonnet.  Might I but dye (Ah!) in this mournful state, Then were my death the Actor of my ease; For then my death would to the world relate What Saint was subject to my Breasts disease. Should death relate (Ah!) no, death must conceale The dainty Mistrisse of my earthly joy. Live then in Peace; yet feare still to reveale The heavenly Actresse of thy Hearts annoy. Ah! Yet not actresse of thy endlesse paine, But the sweet Angel of thy Breasts desire; Therefore with Love immortally remain, Within the fewel of her beauties fire. No sooner had he ended his Sonnet, but he instantly began afresh to weepe, and so determining to asswage his sorrowes (vailing his Bonnet) he presently departed, walking aloofe from them in a faire Summer- house; the which our amorous troop perceiving, began immediately to conjecture that he was in love with some cruel Lady, and so her rigorous repulse was the motive of his distempered passion; whereat, weighing his grief by their own malady, and his disconsolation by their own sicknesse, they all bewailed his (tragical) misfortune, & pitied the accident of his distasteful calamity; lamenting that ever their arrival was the occasion to refresh his (amorous) uncured wound, and sorrowing that their presence in his capacity ingendered prejudicial contemplation. Yet at last to bring with Ariadnes thred our history out the Garden, Athelia and Mersilva rose up, determining to depart; which Thalmeno and Palma no sooner perceived, but they immediately hyed them to the knots, to gather each for his Mistresse a dainty Nosegay, whose beauty, scent and savor might best delight the humour of their fancies; the which Athelia and Mersilva remarking, began once more to make the round of the Garden, and so as fortune would, passing along by a stately Pyne- tree, they upon the Barke thereof might espye the Characters of some Verses to be very curiously incarved; which desirous to see, thereunto approaching, found this or the like fancie therein contained.  First Fish shall flie within the Element, And Aiery-Birds live in the Ocean sea; Fair Phaebus shall forsake the Firmament, And scorn to grace the cincture of the Day: Thetis shall wander o're proud Atlas top, And Nilus cease to water Egypts land; The Earth into the Skies shall fountains drop, And Neptune's Face refuse to kisse the strand: All Ships shall saile upon the massie Main, And Ætna frieze at splendor of the Sun; Dame Cytherea quite shall lose her train, And Elephants like Clouds in aire shall run: Lebanus -Cedars shall like thistles spring, And Hysop-tops aspire into the skie; From Thule to Gange the Dormouse voice shall ring, And Gnats shall drink all Brooks and Rivers dry, Before th'Idea of Florina's sight Shall once have power from me to take his flight. Which Sonnet persuing, and pondering what this Lady therein mentioned might be; They immediately went, and thereof advertised Thalmeno & Palma , who not a little admiring to see the name of Florina there charactered, began to conjecture that he might be Prince M aedor : in respect whereof, to satisfie their ardent desire, they with their Ladies went towards him, where being entred the Bower, Thalmeno boorded him as followeth: me to term you: I beseech you in friendship to certifie me, whether you are acquainted with the Princesse Florina Daughter unto the King of Numidia ; and also whether you know Prince M aedor Son nnto the King of Biafara? The Stranger no sooner heard pronounc'd the sacred Name of Florina , but he instantly as being conquered with too many divine cogitations, (in fainting sort) fell to the ground; when closing his eyes, one would have thought he resolved as then to take his last definitive Conge of this Caitiff-world. The which our amorous Crew no sooner beheld, but (pittying this sorrowful accident) they so imployed their best skill for his assistance, that in short time he recovered; and elevating himselfe upon his (as yet) weak legs, banishing silence from his faltring tongue, he in sighing sort breathed out these speeches: so fetching a deep sigh, again continued as followeth . Know (courteous Knights, and beautiful Ladies) that I have been acquainted with the Princesse Florina ; and to be plain, am that unfortunate M aedor which you enquire for: Unfortunate M aedor , I may well say, in being absent from Florina , the memory of whose divine beauty hath this fourty moneths been the goddesse of my devotions. Therefore, gracious Knights, if you know any news of the aforesaid Princesse, I beseech you in kindnesse to make my breast therewith acquainted; and to congratulate your courtesies. I will in lieu thereof remain your affectionate Servant. The which speech he had no sooner uttered, but Prince Thalmeno thinking it more then time to administer some soveraigne dictamnum to his tormented Patient, instantly returned him this applausible Reply. Druino King of Cicilia , and this Prince my cousin, Son to---King of Egipt ; who some two years since, resolving to travel, having united our resolutions with the league of amity, departed from my Fathers Court, directing our course to overview Africa , and so landing at --- and journying three dayes alone, being destitute of a guide, and unskilful of the Country, by misfortune strayed into an unknown desart; but fortune willing to intermix our bitter sorrowes with some delicious pleasures, conducted us fortunately to a beautiful Castle, which entering we found the Princesse Florina thereof the desolate inhabitant, who having forsaken her Fathers Court, vowed there to remain until the joyful return of your Princely self; therfore valorous M aedor , if you please to accompany us, we are bound for Cicilia , and immediately upon our arrivals, God willing, we will conduct you to the melancholy place of her solitary retirement. M aedor having his capacity repleated with the Zephyr wind of this fortunate newes, very kindly (accepting of their proffer) past his word to accompany them; nay, and with so cheerful acoutenance, that in his dead conceit it seemed the absent Idea of Florina had infused exact vitality; but at last fixing his humane eyes upon the sweet object of the Ladies beautie, and so pondering upon the rarity of his sweet Florina , he boldly demanded of Thalmeno what those Ladies were, and what private occasion induced them to travel; who relating him from point to point the history of their amorous proceedings, and advertising him likewise how they were desirous to be transported for Cicilia , he therupon after having saluted them with a Princely grace, and made his fluent tongue by an eloquent Oration display the dexterity of his ingenious capacity, very voluntarily proffered through the Vineyards and Champion Country to conduct them to the Sea-side; for quoth he, I have travelled these parts, and know the direct course to Golpho-Del-Rey, where I once Landed . Our Amorous Troope being divinely pleased with this applausible newes, very instantly prepared to depart, where they were no sooner arrived, but M aedor very fortunately met with a ship of warre of Madagascar , which belonging to Duke Alphonso his Uncle, was by tempestuous weather and contrary winds forced there to take harbour glad of this unexpected newes, and triumphing in that they saw fortune so smilingly assist their fidelities, they forthwith swapt a bargain with the Master to transport them, and so a favourable wind cleering them from the coast, in a sweet sympathy of heavenly amity, hence they saile for Cicilia , where on the Sea they so long remained, that after many tempestuous storms, having past the Isles of Fernando , the Bay of St. Anne , the Coast of Guenhye , Cape Verd , and the Isles of Teneriffa , they at last safely attained Gibraltar the entrance of the Mediteranean straights;  & so with joy keeping on their course for the desired Island of Cicilia , being opposite of Marsertis , they were towards the night, at the appearance of Cynthia , very quietly becalm'd, in such sort that their ship made no way, but only floated upon the face of Neptune , according as the slacknesse of the current drave her: so that at last keeping good watch, as the third glasse was in election to be finished, the M  r . in his Russet-Cap, walking aloft upon the Spare-deck, very apparently heard the noyse of Oares plowing in the intrails of Thetis ; whereat astonished, resolving to prevent the worst, he mounted the main shrows, directing still his linced eyes, by his attentive eares; so long, till at last (right a-head in their Fore-foot) he might espy a very stout Galley, using all possible speed with Oares and Sayles, swiftly made towards them; at which unlookt for accident (with a magnanimous courage) rousing his spirits, he with his Silver Whistle thundered forth afresh alarum, whereat the whole Troop of Sea-striplings (as if they had been at unawares surprized) with a gallant courage (quitting their course pavilions) mounted the upper-Deck, admiring exceedingly what this unaccustomed accident meant; the which no sooner they had done, but the M  r . shewing them the cause, and they seeing the subject before their eyes, very instantly with heroical resolutions fetched forth their Musquets, and provided all things which might be any way needful for a combat; amongst the rest, the M r . Gunner burning with desire to approve some experience of his praisworthy Art, requested the Captain that he might make some shot or two towards them; whereat condiscending, a couple of Demi- Culverings (which lay directly forth in the Prow) were immediately provided, whereunto giving fire (all the company saying Amen) forth went the shot, with a devilish fury; which being well aimed, so happily arrived to the desired mark, that it not only made a massacre amongst the miserable slaves, but also at so suddain a motion made the Commanders themselves tremble, in such sort, that finding their welcom not so pleasant as they expected, in went their Oars, down their Sailes, each betook themselves to their guard, not once presuming to approach more neere till the morning; which our Master no sooner perceived, but knowing that they would linger till the next day, having appointed each his place, and in his absence given the chief Commanders thereof the obstrict charge, down goes he to the Cabine, to comfort our almost comfortlesse troop of Lovers, who alas, lay in a meere exact humor of dispaire; For they no sooner heard the thundering report of the Cast-peece, but they generally resolved it came from some neere-harbouring enemy: There might you have seene Thalmeno mourn, to see his Athelia lament; Palma sigh, to see his Mersilva shed teares; and M aedor weep, to see them all so disconsolate: there might you have heard Athelia almost sighed out her heart, thinking to lose her Thalmeno ; have seen Mersilva on the point to melt into tears, to depart from her Palma , have perceived M aedor afresh with threats to menace the gods for the losse of his Florina ; and in fine, to have seen all to exclaim of their miseries, in that the fatal Atrapos of misfortune began so soon to cut the thred of their future contentation. Which the M  r . perceiving, having his breast penetrated with the clangor of their dolorous exclamations, very froliquely in the best sort he could, bade them be all of good cheere, adding moreover, that there was no fear in the matter; for that he doubted not but in the morning to remain conquerour; wherupon our three couragious Princes fell afresh to comfort their two sorrowful Ladies, within the influence of whose eyes for that night Morpheus could receive no entertainment; for diving into the conceit of the Masters speeches, and conjecturing they should the next morning enjoy a hot breakfast, they began to doubt of their own safeties, and to imagine what bloody stratagem might befall their Princely favourites, the which again and again imprinting within the Cabinet of their memories cerebrosity, they could not refrain from bewatering their Damask cheeks with chrystaline teares which distilled from the conduits of their sorrowful eyes: the which our Princes perceiving, and seeing that no perswasive arguments or soliciting intreaties might prevaile, or once evaporate their sighs with the wind of courage, knowing that it now stood upon them (in so dangerous a cause) to demonstrate their valours, as well to prevent their own captivity from the Pyrats, as also to free their Ladies, within whose brests their affectionate loves, nay lives lay imprisoned) very resolutely without taking leave, departed the Cabin,  & so thrust themselves amongst the souldiers and mariners, which were already infusing of audacity to their valour, and of valour to their resolutions; whom most couragiously they animated with such undaunted applausible exhortations, that imediately the souldiers generally protested to sacrifice their lives for the establishing of their tranquilities. So that when the limits of night was expired, and that the dawn drew near, Aurora in her silver apparel no sooner began to look through the Casements of heaven, but our Master and Princes so ordered the matter, that their flags and streamers were abroad playing with the winde, their Ordnance and Muskets arang'd and laden, their Waste-cloths unloosed, their Nettings laced up, their Yards sling'd, their Companies divided, their Linstocks lighted, the Master upon the Poop with his silver Sword to whease them to Lee-ward, and the Trumpets ready at a beck to sound the first onset: On the contrary part, the Gally dighted her self in the pride of her warlike jollity, and with a valorous resolution came towards them, making such terrible clamors and out-cries, as if they meant to affright Jupiter himself in the cittadel of his impregnable monarchie: when instantly, the winde begining to fresh, our Master by the condescent of the three Princes edged very near; and so being come within Cannon shot, brought themselves by their short sails, resolving to attend her comming, and with honour to fight it out; the which the Galley-Slaves espying, began to cry victoria , conjecturing that they had already yeelded: but alas, they were deceived of their hope; for thinking to board them, the Ship in a moment powred in their small shot as thick as hail, and therewithall let fly her whole broad-side, which in the Galley made such a rattling thunder, that their rails, penets, yea hatches and all began (superbiously) to band with the sky: there might you have seen some dangerously wounded, which lay gasping their last; some already slain, imbruing themselves in their fellows blood; and some, whose heads flying from their bodies went to advertise their friends of their woful Tragedies. Whereat the Captain and Commanders of the Galley fuming with rage, in that so unexpected they received such hot entertainment, disdaining to dye in their debts, bade their Gunners give fire, where betwixt them was so furious a Combat, that it was hard to judge on which side victory would encline: But leaving the event thereof, to the inconstancy of Fortune, we will a little erre from the fight, and take a second survey of our Ladies lamentations, who being destitute of their Lovers, and looking every minute for unmerited death, making their eyes gush forth fountains of tears, and their Breasts volley forth millions of sighes, for sorrow tearing their gorgeous apparrel, and the tresses of their translucent hair, lay imbathing their conceits in the flood of despair, as comfortlesse as innocent Lambs in the paw of the Lyon: their tongues could utter no speech, but the name of their Princes, whereupon continually ruminating, they infused their courage within the labyrinth of perplexity. Ah, quoth Athelia , would my breast might be a Bulwark for Thalmeno's preservation! and quoth Mersilva , would my body might be a Countermure for Palma's safety! else, quoth Athelia , I might die in Thalmeno's arms, to demonstrate my constancy! or, quoth Mersilva , I end my daies at Palma's feet, to manifest my fidelity! In which doleful manner, they mournfully remained, as if Thanatos had already assummon'd their senses to pay nature her due. But again to our Combatants; who eagerly seeking, did so valorously behave themselves, that it was impossible yet to judge, which side Fortune did most favour. But to conclude: as time gives a full period to all terrestrial accidents; when the fatall day was almost finished, wherein many had their lives catostrophies most famously signed with the signet of death, the Galley most dangerously (between wind and water) received a despairful shot, in such pittiful manner, that they all within-board made a pittiful cry: the which our Princes understanding, instantly conceived some hope of victory; whereupon they afresh let fly their roaring Canon, whose fiery Bullets wrapt in terrour, made such spacious breaches in the side of the Galley, that they seeing no apparition of hope whereon to rely amaining their saile, immediately yeelded, rendring themselves to the mercy of their mortal enemies: the which our Princes and company perceiving, for sudden joy shouted amain, triumphing in the conquest of so famous a Victory; when instantly they hoisted out their Shallop to avoid the prize: but now when she was replenished sufficiently with men and munition, if any repulse peradventure should have been offered, our Princes were in a difficult difference which of themselves should therein go Commander. Thalmeno he willingly offered his service, and Palma he vowed not to stay behinde; but Princely M aedor , whose magnanimous breast did likewise inharbour a Hectors courage, seeing his associates in contention, which should first be admitted, stept in and furiously protested that they should both stay with their Ladies, and he only would go the Master of the Ships: they likewise hearing of his voluntary resolution, allowed best of his reason, and so gave sentence he should. Whereupon with a noise of harmonical trumpets, away goes M aedor , and down goes Thalmeno and Palma to the Cabin. Their even now comfortlesse Ladies, being by the Herauld of report advertised of the victory, came reciprocally to imbrace them with congratulation of their undaunted magnanimities, where so joyfull a meeting was betwixt them demonstrated, that their conceits which right then swimmed in the Ocean of dispair, did now float upon the blisful waves of pleasant delectation; for their Cynthian complexions were meatmorphosed to cherry countenances; and their mournful eyes which were almost submerg'd with brinish tears, did now reflect their beams of splendant vivacity: as glorious Phoebe being freed from the cloudy prison of sable obscurity, each joyfully joyed in each others presence; either reap'd more then exquisite applause, and (in fine) all received such delectable contentation, that to be plain, my abrupt pen can no way display thereof the exquisitenesse, because my peevish capacity was never acquainted with the labyrinth of the like amorous encounters. In respect whereof, leaving their secresie to themselves, and the censure thereof to the industrious Readers, I will make a brief apostrophie from their melodious parling, and a little entreat of Prince M aedors proceedings; who by this time being neer the Galley, at last very resolutely entered his men, without finding any to resist them; who seeing they were all hidden, by sound of trumpet commanded them to make their appearance: when immediatly in trembling sort, out came the prisoners, who seeing their enemies with their swords drawn in their hands, instantly fell on their faces, desiring pardon; upon whose submissive prostration M aedor commanded his Souldiers, that upon pain of death none should hurt them, either in body or goods; the which the Captain understanding (conceiving some hope of his liberty) very sorrowfully came forth, desiring his life, which benigne Prince M aedor instantly granted: Whereupon after he had informed him of whence the Gally was, and to whom he appertained, he to M aedor continued his speech, as followeth: Albeit it grieveth my Valour (couragious Knight) to be conquered by any; yet since my fortune must needs (because predestinated) endure the frown of Bellona, I again rejoyce in that it was my blisfulnes to become tributary to so benigne a Commander; therefore kinde Knight, in respect that with such heroical voluntarines you have afforded us our lives, Know that within this next adjoyning Cabine, there is resident a vertuous Lady, whom fortune hath predestinated to be our prisoner: Her parentage I know not; but if outward gestures may depaint inward qualities, I presume she is some Lady of Noble descent; her behaviour (though in adversity) is such, that as she carrieth her perplexity with a modest countenance, so she disdaineth to render her self tributary to the infidelity of Fortune. M aedor no sooner understood this (unexpected) news, but burning with desire to know what this Lady might be; very friendly commanded the Captain to bring him to her presence; where he was no sooner arriv'd, but he might perceive this doleful Lady as it were imbathing her self in the stream of her tears; having prostrated her person on the floore, and overvailed her Visage with an obscure skarf, lying as it were in a Cyatical Lethargie, thinking that the first that entered was the Harbinger of death, or to be plain, the inhumane administer of her untimely martyrdome: but lo, it fell out otherwise; for when she thought he was lodging his Rapier in the cytadel of her innocent breast, why even then he took seisure of her lily hand, and with an amiable voice uttered these speeches: Arise, fair Lady; for your life and liberty is granted you! VVhereat very instantly, as being acquainted with the voice, she with a commendable grace started up; and perceiving (as indeed she thought) that it was her Princely M aedor which pronounc'd that melodious sentence; at the hearing thereof, as being ravished with too many divine cogitations, in a dangerous swound she fell to his feet. M aedor perceiving this tragical unexpected accident, having his heart penetrated with the Chaos of passionate fancies, failed not to imploy his best endeavour for her recovery; and so thinking to elevate her on her feeble leggs, by chance ruffling the Scarf from her beautiful visage, perceived it to be his (gracious) Florina ; whereat arousing the sincerity of his eyes, and the vivacity of his contemplations, and making his doubtful conceits run to the confines of astonishment, he at first perambulated with his curiosity, whether it were she which so well resembled the physnomie of her beauty; but lastly having diligently sent the influence of his aspects to make surview of her personage, and finding her to be essentially his unlookt for Florina , with a trembleing resolution advancing his pace, he with outspread arms most amorously went and imbrac'd her; where so delightful a meeting was betwixt them demonstrated, that me thought from so pleasing a solace it was meer sacriledge to separate them: For if M aedor outwardly rejoyced to possesse his affectionate Florina, Florina reciprocally in heart smiled to enjoy the presence of her heroical M aedor . Both sent forth disconsolate sighes in witnesse of their undaunted loves; And faire Florina having her conceits tosticated with too many applausible imaginations, could not (being transported with affection) refrain from bewatring the crymson roses of her angelical visage with many pearled teares, which descended the soile of her alabaster cheeks. But in fine, M aedor giving courage to his faltering tongue, thought to incamp the vantguard of his speeches; but again reflecting his partial aspects upon the divine object of Florina's beauty, he so found his conceits devoted to silence, that the review of her chery-countenance smoothing up his senses in an extasie of contentation, forced him instantly to fall into a despairful trance; the which sorrowful Florina perceiving, melting as it were into teares for imminent aggrivation, with her Lily-fingers began to corroborate the organs of his temples: so that the Nectar-balm of her soveraign breath infusing vitality to his sickly senses, made him again refetch his accustomed courage; when inviting his wandering tongue to display the secrets of his wavering capacity, taking Florina by her alabaster-hand, he from the profundity of his conceits, and cabinet of his affections, pronounced her these speeches following. cincture of thy imbracements, or now sacrifice the remainder of my life before the aspect of thy divine deity, I should not only account my self favoured of the Sts. in affording me such good fortune, but also esteem my enterprises more then blisful, in being ratified by the Synod of the gods themselves: but sweet Florina , (and therefore sweet because Florina ) since the angelical map of thy personage, and the sacred Zephir of thy Nectar speeches have so freed me from the chains of bondage, and unloosed me from the fetters of despair, that now before the shrine of your beauteous benignity, fair Mistresse of my thoughts, and goddesse of my conceits! I present you with the gift of my service, the donation of my constancie,  & the consecration of my fidelity, assuring you that as I have long since remained in the prison of your celestial beauty, so I resolve to dye in being accounted your ever faithful (and never wavering) Servant to the end; that when the fatal sisters determine to finish the catastrophe of my daies, unpartial Charon may testifie that in the Elizian plains, my penetential soul onely vowed to adore the beautiful image of Florina , as the bright Cynosure of eternal comfort, to whom I dedicated the generality of my terrestrial devotions. Which heavenly speeches Florina no sooner understood, but over-shadowing the center of her lily cheeks with the damask canopy of a crymson vail; having imbathed the Imps of her tender capacity in the stream of Love, and the conceits of her maiden resolutions in the floud of affection; being as it were in a very delectable extasie (albeit sudden conceited joys made her senses, yea self to tremble) she in her Ivory hand taking her snow-white handkerchiff, and evacuating the pearled tears from her chrystalline countenance, with a lovely (yet sorrowful) voice, she returned him this pleasant reply: god which ratified thy freedome, or with that favourable Saint which reconducted thee to my presence: my sincere congratulation should before their sight display with what faithful constancy I attended thy coming, and now with what simpathy of entire amity, I honour thy arrival: therefore welcome, (nay more then welcome) sweet M aedor to thy sorrowful Florina , and millions of thanks to gracious Mars , for investing me captive to so fortunate a conquerour: fortunate I may well say, because in the essence of thy personage, my absolute (nay onely) solace lay imprisoned; and if more may be, more then fortunate, in being by the enjoyance of thy prospect deprived from the residence of my accustomable disconsolations. Ah dear M aedor , since thy sorrowful departure, I have lived most comfortlesse; yet in enjoying the felicity of thy visage, I now wreath up the memory of aggravation in the cinders of oblivion; love (yea love) because invincible affection hath so captivated my conceits, and conquered my senses, that onely I now live to serve sweet M aedor ; and maugre the effects of Fortune, resolve to dye in the amorous league of his desired friendship. M aedor pondering upon this kinde answer, and perceiving his concetis were exceedingly obliged to her courtesie, straining her most affectionately by her Lily fingers, and banding his partial aspects upon the Tempe soyle of her Ivory incarnate visage, imbracing her again within his lovely (nay more then lovely, because most faithful) armes, he from the concavity of his joyful breast, shaped her this friendly answer. senses; banish now from thy breast the memory of sorrow, and let only the motives of contentation flourish in the Common-wealth of thy conceits; for now before the shrine of thy sacred selfe, upon the Altar of fidelity, M aedor presents thee with so compleat a portion of undaunted friendship, as you any way can desire, or the gods themselves distribute: And sweet Florina , since by fortune it so falleth out, that now contrary to my expectation you are made my blisful prisoner, know Mistresse of my imaginations, and Angel of my delights, that in most honourable company I am bound for Cicilia , where as soone as Æ olus and Neptune shall set me ashore, I will most willingly, if you please, solemnize the Rites of our Nuptials with the contract of Mariage, and ratifie my beautiful Florina to be the sole and supreme Empresse of my breasts expectation. Florina no sooner understood the harmonious Etymologie of these sacred speeches, but in her breast  & capacity sweetly ruminating upon the sugred Cadenca of their delectable interpretation, assummoning her Maiden senses in the field of affection, she instantly returned him this kind answer. hand-maid, I will now repent me of my enterprise, and so frustrate thy expectations in the Autumn of their hopes, but rather I pray resolve (at least if my prayers may gain acceptance in the front of your amity) that Florina esteems the seale of our Nuptials to be the preamble of her fortunacy, and the uniting of our affections the very quintessence of her felicity; therefore I I beseech you delay no time, but rather advance thy enterprise, to the end that M aedor receiving the chief solace of his breast, Florina may reciprocally enjoy the desired Prince of her immortal delectation. M aedor infusing her applausible resolution within the affectionate profundity of his competent censure; having his breast penetrated with more exquisite amity then he ever thought Venus presented to her wanton Adonis , or Dido to her wavering Æ naeas , sending again the influence of his aspects to ratifie a mutual combination with her Angelical beauty, he kindly imbracing her slender waste, and courteously giving her coral lips the impresse of a Nectar kisse, with a gracious familiar resolution, framed her this amorous answer. that I may advertise my Princely Associates of our blisfulnes, and so prosecute our voyage to Cicilia. To Cicilia! quoth Florina: and therewithal the pearled teares, trickled down her Vermilion cheeks; which M aedor perceiving, and admiring at her suddain sorrowfulnesse, couragiously demanded her the occasion of her disconsolation. Oh! quoth Florina, since I first heard you repeat the name of Cicilia, my present joyes doth afresh put me in mind of my forepast myseries: for, lovely M aedor, having for thy sake sequestred my selfe from all company, and built up my residence in a desolate Castle, thereunto unexpectedly arrived two sorraign Knights from Cicilia, who in reward of some small benignity I afforded them, protested very solemnly to research thee out (at least if the confines of Africa did contain thy personage .) Well quoth M aedor , and have you not since heard of their adventurous proceedings? No , replyed Florina, whereat I much sorrow, in respect they were amators of my passiors, and favourites of thy affections . Thus with most pleasant pratle in amorous dalliance they deluded the time; till at last Prince M aedor shaking himselfe out of his delicious dumps, and arousing his sences from their amorous plaudity, very secretly in his breast stamp'd this resolution; Why M aedor , are thy humane affections so devoted to love, that now in entertaining Cupid , thou givest Mars a farewel, or in courting Cytherea , thou leavest Bellona desolate? what, hath the faire aspects of Florina (with Circes ) so charm'd the fuel of thy desire, that in contemplating on her beauty, thou intombest thy military actions in the shrine of oblivion? No, no, M aedor: Affections are but fancies, and love doth best resemble the flowers of Syria , which no sooner flourish with the splendantnesse of Titan , but fade with the obscurity of Cynthia : therefore let passionate fictions give place to fame, and let amorous conceits stoop to magnanimity. Which aspiring speeches he no sooner pronounced, but instantly his fair Florina , in the jollity of her best attire, rusht from out her Cabinet; at the sudden sight wherof, forgetting his former inhumane conclusions, and now devoting his future oraisons to the Altar of her excellency, having lost his Martial courage in the Physnomy of her effeminate countenance, and drowned the motives of war in the chrystaline Vermilion of her beauty, he resolved to direct his pace towards her; but she perceiving his presence, determined to prevent his purpose, and so meeting him half wayes, delivered him this lovely salutation. with the triumphs of content; Fortune you know is variable, therefore let slip no time (in effecting our Nuptials) while opportunity doth present; Only this before we depart, I intreat you that these miserable slaves by your conquering valour made captives, may (without prejudice of their substance or selves) have free permission to depart safely. Prince M aedor well liking her benign nature, and commending her capacity for projecting so charitable a vertue, very willingly thereunto condiscended, and so taking conge of his prisoners, and commanding his Shallops to be made ready, (imbracing his goddesse Florina in his princely arms) with his noise of clarent Trumpets most cheerfully departed; but long he floated not on the surges of Thetis , till a favourable Zephyr gale reconducted him in safety to his ship, where couragiously entering, and demanding for the Princes, answer was instantly made him, that they were in the Cabine, playing on the Lute to delight their Ladies; whereupon leaving Florina (for a whiles) at the doore, down gos he to participate of their exquisite melody; the which Thalmeno and Palma no sooner perceived, but laying their instruments apart, each particularly with his Lady went and saluted him, asking what newes? why none quoth M aedor , but only this, that instead of a rich prize, I have found an inestimable Jem, the valuation whereof, in my conceit, may not sufficiently be numbred by the whole industrious characters of Arithmetiques faculty. No quoth Athelia and Mersilva, why then it appeares you have lighted upon the Mint of Mexico, or else fallen foule of the Minerals of Peru. Neither have I, replyed M aedor , and yet I divinely rejoyce in possessing the tenuity of so sacred a present. Whereunto Palma and Thalmeno answered, It is then like, Prince M aedor, that you have understood some novelty from your Princesse Florina, or at least seen the resemblant Id aea of her beautiful excellency. Maedor hearing the divine name of his Florina repeated, could not refraine from producing secret smiles, because the syllables of her sacred Anagram ravished his sences in an extasie of delectation; whereat Florina advancing her pace, presented her selfe before the compleat view of the company; at which beautiful object, Thalmeno and Palma reflecting their linced regards upon the superlative daintinesse of her Angelical Physnomy, presently conjectured her (as indeed she was) to be the perfect personage of admired Florina ; but again, not able to ratifie their suspected assurance with certainty, still contemplating on the rarity of such exquisit perfection, looking one on the other, durst not presume in adventuring to salute her; on the other side, Florina binding the influence of her speculation upon the mirror of their countenances immediately (by the Architect of their complexions) deemed them to be Thalmeno and Palma ; but at last after many amorous regards sent from the influence of their eyes were evacuated, Thalmeno refetching the sensibility of his conceits, began to esteeme that it was absolutely faire Florina upon the soil of which applausible resolution, definitely erecting an assured foundation, he very joyfully stept, and with a lovely kisse saluted her in this sort. of thanks to debonair fortune for investing mine eyes with the object of such unexpected blisfulnesse! Florina hereat blushing in the Lily soile of her alabaster cheeks (to the spectators sight) produc'd the apparition of crymson Roses; and so (after having glanced upon M aedors excellency) addressing her speech to Princely Thalmeno , she very gallantly with a modest grace, returned him this dulcid reply: Thanks, courteous Prince, for your heroical benignity; and more then fortunate am I, to be the essentiall subject of your dilectable contentation . But here Prince Palma interrupting her speeches, went majestically, and likewise saluted her; where betwixt these three majesticks of affection, such joyful plaudities of exquisite amity was repeated, that Athelia and Mersilva (of Florina unseen) sitting attentively in a corner, admired what this unlookt for prospect betokened; for first investing the habilement of a jealous conjecture, they thought this minion of beauty was of purpose come to frustrate their hopes of expected contentation: but instantly poizing the fidelity of their Princes by their own affections, and their undaunted loves by their absolute likings, (repenting themselves for the conceit of such unmerited inconstancy) they both resolved in familiar amity very kindely to salute them: but Prince M aedor standing aloof from their presence, and conjecturing by the mutability of their countenances, that their imaginations were tosticated in the surges of perplexitie, finding a lovely remorse in his affectionate breast, with a gallant (heroical) resolution went and in this sort, saluted them: deity) This beautious Nymph (if speaking without partiality) which here presents her self before the influence of your comtemplations, is (only) the sweet substance of my (admired) Florina; Florina I say, whose exquisite pourtraict and dainty personage I adore as the unique goddesse of my capacities felicitie. Athelia and Mersilva swallowing down the Ambrosian sweetnesse of these sugred speeches, and infusing in their cerebrosities the unlook't for event of this applausible accident, demonstrating by the plaudity of their smiling aspects that their conceits were rak'd up in the imbers of delectation, with the sympathizing unity of one melodious voice returned him this harmonical answer: Nay then, Prince M aedor , we exquisitely rejoyce in that celestial deity hath coroniz'd the trinary of our affections with the Garland of content; and much solace in that the fancies of our conceits are so blisfully confirmed by the fortunate arrival of your divine Florina ! Whereupon Prince M aedor gratifying their courtesies with thanks, and their curiosities with affection, taking each by the Lily hand, determined to go and salute his Saint; but on the contrary part, Prince Thalmeno and Palma conceiving their determination, thought to prevent their purpose, and so imbracing the Lady Florina in their arms, went reciprocally likewise to meet them; yea, and in such amorous sort, that each lovely Band advancing their pace, they at last, very affectionately approached one the other; where on both sides was demonstrated such super- ceremonious courtesie, that for instant joy me thought my Muse stood silent, as being ravished with pleasure in the labyrinth of delectable admiration. To relate therefore the loveli-smiles, affectionate sighes, piercing countenances, and pleasant prattle which were banded and sent between this amorous army, were but a meritorious subject to make this my (abrupt) Pamphet swel into an ample story. Therefore to avoid prolixity, and yet in such mediocrity, as hoping not to incur the Readers indignation, I will leave to consider with what fervent desire each wish't themselves landed upon the (esteemed Pactolus) shoares of golden Cicilia , the which the Master of the Ship perceiving (having his breast penetrated with the consideration of their tormented amities) failed not to the utmost of his power to shorten their Seafaring Voyage; so that hoysting on more Saile, and plowing through the liquid intrals of Nereus , they at last in a radiant day (when Titan in his Meridian thron began with his splendant locks to visit the Western Plains) very fortunately espyed the desired coast of Cicilia ; which at first they could not well make, untill the Æ tna Promontory decided their doubt: which the Master perceiving (throwing up his Cap for joy) went and immediatly advertised our Cyprine troop of this fortunate news; which no sooner was by the Herauld of report bruted amongst them, but instantly leaving their amorous (yet chaste) dalliance, they very cheerefully (being desirous to repleat the influence of their eyes with so wished for an object) most couragiously mounted the upper Deck, by which time the winde continually freshing, they were almost approaching the shore: The prospect whereof so revived their sickly senses, that Prince Thalmeno at last seeing the Ship at an Anchor, very couragiously commanded the Boatsen to set them a-land. In which mean time, the three Princesses hying to their cabinets, did so gorgeously dight themselves in the pride of their glistering jollity, that they rather resembled heavenly Nymphs, then humane Paragons, and Sacred Queens, then Terrestrial Personages: For their Angelical cheeks, which their golden hair delighted to sport withall; their globy fronts, within whose Alabaster circumference the Graces range in; their piercing eyes of power, to obscure the brightness of Olympus; and their Ivory paps, wherein their azured veins make their Nectar Ampythrite display such a delicate apparition of Paphian allurement, that I absolutely conjecture Ulysses would have stoopt to contemplate on the soyle of their countenances; and Jupiter himself, at their delicate sight, to be invested their favourite, would have left fair Ganymede desolate upon the Downs of Ida . So now the blisful hour of their departure being come, arm in arm, like Saints of Felicity they rushed forth, presenting themselves to their Princes; who attending their arrival, received them with more then exquisite applause; where amongst them past so many millions of Amazon speeches, that the motives thereof, would have daunted the proudest enemy of (Angelical) Cytherea : But in fine, they generally taking leave of the Company, (and the Shallop ready) in most exquisite Heroical manner they most gallantly departed: At whose Ultimum vale , the Master gave such a thundering volley of Ordnance, that the rebounding Eccho thereof drave the Harbouring Cicilians into the affrighting humour of Timerositie; upon which unexpected Accident, presupposing that some Forreign Enemy was come to invade them, they in swarms of Martiall Troops directed their course to the Sea-side; upon whose obdurate Sands with Drums couragiously sounding, and Ensigns sumptuously displayed, they very valorously attended their Landing. Our Princes perceiving this unexpected Warlike Assembly, began immediatly to doubt the issue of their Martiall determinations; so that grounding their resolutions upon the Rock of discretion, and their imaginations upon the Bulwark of Tranquillity, they afar off commanded a Banner of Truce to be demonstrated; and so evapourating fear from their courage, and timerosity from their Countenances, they very audaciously drew near the shore; Which the Cicilians espying, being desirous to know of what Country they were, and what this unaccustomed Alarme meant, in swarms of Martial Troops with magnanimous resolutions they advanced, to prevent their Landing: But Prince Thalmeno with the rest of his amorous Associats, not passing for their flourishing bravadoes, commanded the Boatsen to row them ashore; which no sooner was effected, but presenting their Ladies with many sugred kisses (for their Bien Venue ) each conducting his own beautifull Saint, they very valiantly marched forwards: The Cicilians conjecturing to have fought some hot skirmish, being only instead thereof met by this weak company, drag'd their Ensigns with laughter in the dust, whereas heretofore they superbiously displayed them in the ayre with doughtiness. In fine, the chief Commanders of the Regiments, burning with desire to know what this Martial effeminate, Tragi-Comedy meant, with couragious resolutions advanced their paces to parle with them: whom no sooner they approached, but first glancing their aspects upon the beautifull countenances of the Angelical Ladies, they at last making an Apostrophy from their Beauties, setled their sights upon the bold Complexions of the admired Knights; so that their (Lynceus) eyes ranging circumspectly upon the valorous Physnomy of their Heroical visages, they at last very apparently perceived their Soveraign young Prince Thalmeno to be there present: At which applausible (contemplative) Object, having their hearts conquered with instant Trophies of many delectable Triumphs, they casting aside their weapons, went and submissively prostrated themselves to his feet: which Prince Thalmeno perceiving, after having gratified their loyal affectionate humility with thanks, commanded them to Troop up their Forces, and so to accompany him and his Princely associates to the Palace: Which radiant celestiall news was no sooner bruted in the Camp, but very sumptuously in Warlike array, the porches being strewed with Laurel boughs and Roses, they gallantly marched forwards; whereof the ancient King Druyno being certainly advertised, (having his heart ravished with the applausible news of his Son Thalmeno's arrival) instantly commanded three superbious rich Coaches to be sent against them, to convey him with his Princely companions to the Court; which trampling couragious Coursers, like the Steeds of Phoebus , made such speedy celerity, that in short time they drew neere the Suburbs of Mesana ; which being the capital City of Cicilia , was so proudly dight in the pride of her warlike jolity, that the multitude of roaring Cannons, and silk ( Iris ) Ensigns, being planted on the Bulwarks and Towers, rather made me conjecture it to be famous Troy , then fair Mesana . The King his father being certified of his neere approach, accompanied with his lovely Queen, together with a glistering Regiment of Ladies, and Cavaliers, very Majestically issued forth to meet them, where before the Port-Royal they sumptuously saluted each other, and in such amibale wise, as was either in right due to the Father, or in reason (correspondent) befitting the Son; the Queen likewise with joyful teares bade him welcome, and so after having generally saluted as well Prince Thalmeno , as Palmo and M aedor , with their beautiful Ladies, they in pompeous magnificence rode on to the City; at whose joyful entrance, the Loyal-hearted Inhabitants caused such a thundering peal of Ordnance to be discharged, that the terrible rebounding eccho thereof not only affrighted Jupiter in his Celestial Diadem, but likewise made Mars himself tremble in the (sacred) Bulwark of his impregnable Citadel; the streets also as they past, were beautified with many sumptuous Pageants, where to demonstrate the Citizens voluntary kindnesse, this Royal Troop was feasted with many curious banquets, presented by peerelesse Virgins of super excellent beauty: Thus passing the streets in bravery, being impaled by the warlike young men of the City, they at last arrived to the dignifyed Palace; where a double Court of Guard (commanded by the chief Nobles of the Island) most famously received them. To recount therefore the sumptuous Feastings, the triumphant Tiltings, the majestical Masques, and the honourable assemblies, wherewith King Druino admiredly celebrated the arrival, were (I think) superfluous to this my peevish Pamphlet, and the Readers discreet capacity, because I conjecture he can more curiously conceive it in his contemplation, then my Infant-Muse may any way dilate it; by vertue of which premises, to proceed briefly with our history, Thalmeno having from point to point displayed King Druyno his Father the manner of his proceedings; as also depainted him the vertuous (Princely) disposition of the three Angelical Ladies (but especially of his Saint Athelia ) he being (upon report thereof) desirous to try if the temple of her sences were adorned with such rare perfections as his Son affirmed, very privatly invited her to a secret conference; where wresting her with sundry intricate questions, as well of wit as loyalty, Love as Modesty; he at last found her compleatly so vertuous, that comparing her ingenious qualities with her Princely descent, he accounted himself hapy to be endued with so gracious a Daughter, and his Son most fortunate in being endowed with so peerelesse a Paragon; the Queen likewise reflecting a partial eye upon her modest gesture, and prying into the concavity of her Princely conditions, found her natural qualities to be so adorned with the affable demonstratives of debonair benignity, that perioding her capacity with this definitive resolution, she thought her not only to be a second Diana for modest chastity, but also a super-excellent Calliope for ingenious curiosity; by vertue whereof, stil seriously ruminating upon the measured Cadenca of her Princely educations, as also pondering upon the splendant vertues wherewith they saw the Garden of her glistering cerebrosity to be imbellished, she imediately resolved that no greater blisse could accidentally befall her Sonne, then (for his Nuptial compartner) to be graced with so sweet a Princesse; so that the Father being (applausibly) pleased, the Mother more then divinely contented, and both triumphing in the conceits of this delectable sympathy, could enjoy no solace in their estimates, nor pleasure in their contemplations, untill they had assigned the day of desire, wherein the two darlings of Love might enjoy the fruition of their ardent affection; which was not long prefixing; for their Princely Parents knowing the frailty of youth, the force of love, the power of beauty, and the efficacy of temptation, thought, whiles occasion did present, to let no opportunity slip; and therefore, in the plaudity of a pleasant humor, appointed that the next Festival (which was some twenty dayes following) their Nuptial Rites should be solemnized; which sacred divine newes Thalmeno and Athelia no sooner understood, but having their hopes elevated upon the wings of contentation, flew as it were aloft, in the Celestial Paradise of eternity; so, as imbathing their curiosities in the Nectar streams of conceived solace, with many millions of amorous applauds they attended the houre wherein their expectations should be crowned with the heavenly Garland of content. But now to our other Princes and their Ladies, who being by the Herauld of report advertised of Thalmeno's Fortunate proceedings, burn with desire upon the Stage of Matrimony to be Actors of the like Comedy; the which Thalmeno perceiving, viewing their languishing sicknesse by his own tormented malady, went to the King his Father, and with a trembling Oration (the teares standing in his eyes) requested that his two Princely companions might likewise under his gracious favour enjoy their vertuous desired Paragons; which condign processe he so authentically sollicited, that the King his Father (with direction) diving into the concavity of his Sons demand, and finding the subject of their desires to be extracted from the pure model of chaste affection, presenting pitty before the stage of his eyes, and charity upon the Theatre of his contemplations, (with a debonair aspect) gave sentence, that one day should finish the general triplicities of their mariages. The Zephir winde of which sweet novelty was no sooner by Thalmeno transported to the ears of our amorous regiment, but Palma imbracing his beautifull Mersilva , and M aedor kissing the coraline lips of his faire Florina , did in the triumphes of love as it were floate upon the streams of blisful applause; so that their lovely conceits fetching a course beyond the confines of Cynthia , did (without rest) range upon the Paradise of approaching pleasures. On the other side, whiles these Imps of Venus were with pleasant dalliance beguiling the time, King Druino was not idle in making sumptuous preparations for the celebrating of their weddings: and the more to dignifie that day with heroical triumphs, he through the Carrafours of his Iland (by Gratian his Herauld of Arms) commanded a Tournoy and Joust to be proclaimed; whereunto not onely the Nobles of his Dominions should be welcome, but also all Forreign Princes and Cavaliers (whatsoever) might have free accesse: The heroical thundering report whereof was no sooner (by the silver trump of fame) despersed through the harbouring Nations, but thither (I mean to Cicilia ) came abundantly flocking many valorous Troups of magnanimous Martialists; so that at the time of assignation, as there wanted not swarms of prospectors to behold the triumphs, so there needed not innumerable of Cavaliers to satisfie their expectations. So that the joyfull day being come, which as the ingenious Cycilians did illustrate with terrestrial bravery, so the gods themselves in the Synod of their resolutions did determine to stellifie with heavenly beauty: for Aurora no sooner gave the obscure night a valorous overthrow, but splendant Titan in his fiery Coach began with his golden rayes to embelish the cincture of the day; when the streets being hung with curious tapestry, the Pageants adorned with glistering ingeny, and the Pavement strewed with Flora's jollity, by many bands of Kings, Queens, Nobles, and Ladies, these our (Idalian) Lovers most majestically were conducted to the temple; where being by the Ring of matrimony (til the final period of their lives catastrophie) each firmly united to other, They at last in the plaudite of amorous contented imaginations returned to the Palace, where with curious feasts, sumptuous dances, and stately masks, their marriages were so magnificently solemnised, that the description thereof my eaglet Muse (nay all the instinct of Parnassus ) cannot sufficiently relate: Therefore we will make an Apostrophie from these dignified braveries; and being overvailed with the Curtains of obscure night, bring each of these our amorous lovers to their (terrestrial Paradise) Bed-chambers, where the doors being shut,  & they entomb'd within the Ivory shrine of a pair of Lawn-sheets, we wil likewise leave them to their amorous (divine) pleasures, and (praying Venus to guard them within the lists of her sacred influence) return to the next day, wherein the Heroical feats of Chivalry were to be accomplished. The morn was fair, the skyes bright, the winde calm, and Phoebus in his radiant pavilion delighted to grace the cincture of the day with his meridional beauty: therefore the Tilts being built, the Tents erected, the Cavaliers ready, and the Herauld prepared; let us for a whiles give Conge to the Court, and with valour direct our History to the Campe; wherein a gallery (Theatre- wise) was so industriously built, that the royal Assembly, and sweet Ladies might at their ease prospect all, and in safety stand unprejudic'd of any, whose glistering divine beauty so gloriously sparkled admiration to the (astonished) spectators, that the excellent contemplation thereof was not onely of compleat power to infuse valour to the most couragious, but also of exact force to make a meer Dastard prove a doughty Conquerour. Now to begin with the Articles projected for Tilting, it was thus ordained, That the Cicilians should answer all commers: Whereupon by the Kings command, the Herauld sounded to the Combate; when instantly, a Cicilian Knight gallantly mounted, entering the List, was presently met by a warlike Hungarian , who at the first incounter lodging his Lance in his Enemies breast, very valorously unhorsed him, making him (despight his pride) most humbly greet the ground with his Personage, whereon but even then his horse superbiously trampled: To revenge whose infamy, another Cicilian saluting the King, (fetching his cariere) galloped within the Lists; which, as the first, was by the Hungarian in a moment vanquished: The King astonished hereat, by his Page-royal sent the Conquerour a Present; and so extolling highly his valour, commanded two fresh Champions to be admitted; which instantly was accomplished. But wavering Fortune resolving (for a time) to smile on the strange Cavaliers, did by the instinct of her Camelion influence continually afford them victory; so that of twenty Cicilians Champions which ran that day, not one remained Conqueror, but all to their immortall shame, returned vanquish'd. The whole assembly admiring hereat, could not refrain from (blushing) astonishment: the which the King remarking (instantly) commanded the triumphes for that day to break off, and so the general assembly departed. But now as the rumour hereof was bruted abroad, and almost in the Court no other news walking; our three young Princes (I mean Thalmeno Palma and Medor ) storming with disgrace to see their associats so defeated, (tickling their conceits with the consideration of honor)  & fame likewise in their brests refreshing the embers of magnanimity, they at last gave this period to their resolutions; that the very next morn (secretly) in person (maugre the effects of Fortune) they would maintain the Combate: Upon which resolute determination, they hied to the Kings munition- house, and there chose each of them a green Armour of Velvet, imbossed with fixed Stars and Roses of pure beaten gold: But again, the better to bring their purpose to passe, they under the mask of disguise, secretly so wrought with the King, that the next morn, to decide the Combate, there should be of each side elected three chief Champions, whereof, whosoever remained Conquerour, should immortally be invested with the Olympian garland of dignified fame. Whereupon Aurora (having washt her Amber locks in the azured Plain of Thetis ) no sooner with her Cynthian complexion appeared in the purpled sky, but the Drums traversing the Streets, advertised all (aswel natives and forreigners) of the Kings intended resolution. The Cicilian Knights (not knowing of the three Princes determination) prepared themselves to the Combate, and so likewise did the strangers, amongst whom, they elected three magnanimous Princes, whose names anone shal be at large related. In fine, King Druino , the Queen, the three Princesses, with the rest of the Nobility, were again seated in the Theatre, inwardly burning with desire to know on whose side (inconstant) Fortune would encline: whiles thus all things was ready, the Herauld no sooner sounded to the Combate, but three strange Champions entered the lists, being gallantly mounted and dight in silver Armour, inameled with Azure, having their Plumes all white and blew, prefiguring hope: on the contrary part, whiles the Cicilians were in contention, which three should enter: Lo, even then three gallant Cavaliers (being Cicilians ) unexpectedly arrived, richly mounted upon snow-white Barbarian Coursers, apparell'd in green Armour, having their Plumes crymson and white, displaying the beauty of their Ladies; the King and company admiring what these unknown Cicilians (commending their audacious valour and martiall dexterity) commanded them to begin. So the two foremost having made obeisance, giving Spurs to their Jennets, very valorously advanc'd; at which furious encounter, they both so gloriously behaved themselves, that it was difficult to censure whose side victory did most favour; but at last the Cicilian making a short turn (as being expert in those martial actions) planting his Lance in his enemies Crest, very gallantly bore him off the Saddle, to the no little rejoycing of the whole Assembly, which for ravishing applause shoured amain. The second stranger, not any thing daunted with his fellows misfortune, very couragiously set forwards; who being by the next Cicilian as bravely met, were both (at first) very neer dismounted: In which triumphant Combate, having broken their Lances (and sent the shivers in the Aire to band with Mars ) they retired; but no sooner were they furnished by their Pages with fresh Lances, but giving Spurs to their coursers, they again advanc'd, where the Cicilian so gallantly behaved himself, that at the next incounter he forced both horse and man to the grouud, yea and with such a terrible fury, that the whole assembly conjectured he had given the world his (last) fatal farewel, which the third strange Champion perceiving (as having his valorous courage inflamed with honour) with an undaunted resolution gave Spurs to his Jennet; so the last Cicilian Knight perceiving his approach, with a fierce audacity ran to incounter him, where betwixt these warlike heroical Martialists so many valorous feates of Chivalry was demonstrated, that the whole assembly reaped exact applause by prospecting the object of so rare a Combate. But to conclude, as the influence of time giveth a full period to all terrestrial accidents, so in the twinckling of an eye, this strange Cavalier was by the Cicilian Knight most famously vanquished, to the no little rejoycing of the joyful spectators, but also to the delicious applause of the King himself, who for this fortunate victory (erecting Trophies of contentation in the Center of his capacity) came himself in Person to gratifie these Conquerours with his royal thanks: When (being unarmed) espying them to be his Son Thalmeno , with the other two Princes Palma and M aedor ; having his conceipts elevated within the Eden of delectation, very courteously went and imbrac'd them, triumphing in the Conquest of their audacious magnanimities. The Queen likewise being advertised of this unlookt for news, accompanied with the three Princesses, Athelia, Mersilva , and Florina (together with a glistering troop of Ladies) came likewise to salute them, and so (after many amorous speeches were past) conducted them in a most triumphant manner to the Palace; where they were no sooner arrived, but burning with desire to know what these vanquished Knights were, they so wrought with the King, that he presently dispatched a Nobleman of his (gallantly followed) to request them to the Court; when instantly, those vanquished Cavaliers (nothing daunted with the infidelity of misfortune) accompanied with many troops of valorous Knights (with a gallant resolution) directed their pace to the Court, where passing the silver Hall and golden Gallery, they were conducted to the dignified Chamber of Presence, where the King, Queen, and Princesses, under a glorious Canopy of Purple imbossed with Diamonds, attended their arrival; at whose enterance, descending their Thrones of Estate, they advanc'd to salute them. But now remark the mutability of fortune; for our three beautiful Paragons presenting themselves before their Presence (with intent to salute them) and glancing their eyes upon the phisnomy of their complexion, immediately perceived them to be their (unexpected) naturall Fathers; the sodain sight whereof so daunted their contemplations, that betwixt love and feare, they prostrateing themselves to their feet, very instantly fell to the ground, demanding pardon; At which comical accident the Cavaliers prying more seriously upon their bashful complexions, found them absolutely to be their onely daughters; so that natural affection constraining them to rain fountains of tears from the Conduits of their eyes, being in conceit ravished with the joyful alarum-bell of this unlookt for news, they elevated them again on their feet, and so banding their sight each upon others countenances, they in the plaudity of that heavenly contemplation a long time remained silent; but at last accumulating their wits before the throne of discretion, and steeling their tongues with the phrase of joyful acclamation, they in sighing sort breathed out these speeches: Welcome sweet Daughters to your (once) sorrowfull Fathers, and millions of thanks to celestial deity for investing our eyes with the desired object of your beautifull personages: Which King Druino with his Queen no sooner overheard, but perceiving them to be the happy Parents of these vertuous Ladies, in most affectionatewise graciously went and saluted them, blessing the divine houre which afforded them the honour of their presence, and exquisitely rejoycing in that by their arrivals they were made so exceedingly fortunate. The three angelical Princesses all this while having their pleasant countenances metamorphosed to sorrowful complexions, with teares in their eyes stood trembling for timerosity, fearing lest their Fathers would rebuke them for their disobedient audacity. The which their Fathers perceiving, (but not supposing that either of them were married) with chearful countenances demanded the cause of their disconsolations; who having their senses overvailed partly with sorrowful feare, and partly with natural affection, dying their visages with a vermilion-blush, stood meerly silent, as trembling to incamp the avant-guard of their speeches. The which King Druino remarking, very boldly stept to their Fathers, and related him, That being married without your Princely condescents, he supposed they doubted to discover it, fearing lest they should (deservedly) incurre the livery of your indignation. Married! quoth their Fathers; why to whom? Surely, quoth Druino, Athelia to Prince Thalmeno my sonne and heire apparent to my Crown; Mersilva to Prince Palma , Son to Blithgora King of Egypt , and Florina to Prince M aedor son to Orlando King of Biafara . The which these Kingly Parents no sooner understood, but triumphing in that their Daughters were so honorably matched, they amourously went, and most sweetly embraced them: King Druino seeing them herewith divinely contented, determining to adde more applause to their ravished conceits, told them likewise that it were those three dignified Gallants (their Son in Laws) that so valorously had conquered them; which again administering more joy to the plaudity of their pleasant imaginations, did so tickle their conceits with Nectar applauds, that they desired they might fix their eyes upon the object of their Sons personages, which immediatly was performed; For our Heroical young Princes no sooner understood the Zephir news of this strange novelty, but instantly posting to their presence, they very obediently saluted them, imploring pardon for their audacious enterprises, which with a gracious benigne reply was soon granted them, and so embracing them (in their daughters sights) with a sweet affectionate sympathy, they in publique view generally, from their hearts, ratified that which before was solemnly solemnized. King Druyno perceiving this unexpected Heroical meeting, remarking how these sweet Martialists of affection were with their sweet Paragons fortunately united, failed not in most triumphant order to imbellish this dignified Assembly with sumptuous bravery: So as banquetting these forraign Kings with such Princely entertainment as was befitting their Majestical personages, He a long time retained them in his Cicilian Kingdom, to the no less applause of his faithful Subjects, then admiration of all forreign spectators; many dayes were expired in solemnizing these sumptuous Triumphs, the dignified honour whereof mounting the skies, will till eternity redound to the Cicilians immortal fame. The three renowned Kings seeing it now high time to draw homewards, (because they knew the publique affairs of their Kingdoms required their presence) repared themselves to depart; and so gratifying King Druyno for their Royall entertainment (as also taking their gratious Conge of the Queen and the Nobility of Cicilia ) they at last (with their Princely sons and daughters) most sumptuously imbarqued themselves; when a favourable Zephir gale blowing them from the Cicilian coast, did most pleasantly reconduct them in safety to their own Kingdoms: so as Thalmeno being with his fair Athelia arrived in the Territories of Zanfara, Palma with his sweet Mersilva in the Country of Bohemia , and M aedor with his dear Florina in the Confiues of Numidia , they all very contentedly there lived in the height of most amorous affection: till at last death (by the Dart of Thanatos ) assummoning their aged Parents to pay nature her due; and being deprived from the vanity of this earthly Kingdom to be invested Saints in the Celestial Monarchy, Our young Princely Martialists of love were in their stead most triumphantly Crowned, where living in delectable tranquility, they a long time reigned to their hearts continual comfort, their souls eternal contentation.
