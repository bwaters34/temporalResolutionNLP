 continually frequented the Court of Adobrandinus, because it was his chiefe studie to search out the nature of stones. All that courted to Atlanta were hunters, and none sued to Sapho but Poets. Wheresoeuer Maecanas lodgeth, thether no doubt will schollers flocke. And your honour being a worthie fauourer and fosterer of learning, hath forced many through your exquisite vertue, to offer the first fruits of their studie at the shrine of your Lordships curtesie. But though they haue waded farre & found mines, and I gadded abroad to get nothing but Mites, yet this I assure my selfe, that they neuer presented vnto your Honour their treasure with a more willing minde, then I doo this simple trash, which I hope your Lordship will so accept. Resting therefore vpon your honours wonted clemencie, I commit your Lordship to the Almightie. Your Lordships most dutifully to commaund, Robert Greene. dispraised his small cunning, began both to plaie so loude, and so long, that they were more wery in hearing his musick, then he in shewing his skill, till at last to claw him and excuse themselues, they said his pipe was out of tune. So Gentlemen, because I haue before time rashly recht aboue my pitch,  & yet your curtesie such as no man haue accused me, I haue once againe aduentured vpon your patience (but I doubt so farre) as to be rid of my follie, you will at the least saie as Augustus said to the Grecian, that gaue him oft times many rude vearses: Thou hadst neede (quoth he) reward me wel, for I take more paines to read thy workes, then thou to write them. But yet willing to abide this quip, because I may counteruaile it with your former curtesie, I put my selfe to your patience, and commit you to the Almightie. Farewell. Robert Greene.

Hac iter est, hac dirige, tutior ibis. Richardus Portingtonus. There dwelled in the Citie of Metelyne a certaine Duke called Clerophontes , who through his prowesse in al martiall exploits waxed so proud  & tyrannous, vsing such mercilesse crueltie to his forraine enimies, and such modelesse rigour to his natiue Citizens, that it was doubtfull whether he was more feared of his foes for his crueltie, or hated of his friends for his tyrannie: yet as the worst weede springeth vp more brauely then the wholesomest hearbe, and as the crookedst tree is commonly laden with most fruit, so this rigorous Duke was so fauoured and fostered vp by fortune, his estate beeing so established with honour, and so beautified with wealth, so deckt with the diadem of dignitie, and endued with fortunate prosperitie, hauing in warres such happie successe against his foes, & in peace such dutifull reuerence of his friendes, (although more for feare then fauor) as he seemed to want nothing that eyther fortune or the fates could allowe him, if one onely sore which bred his sorrowe coulde haue bene salued. But this griefe so galled his conscience, and this cursed care so combred his mind, that his happinesse was greatly surcharged with heauinesse, to see the cause of his care could by no meanes be cured. For this Clerophontes was indued with two children, the one a Daughter named Lewsippa , and the other a sonne called Gwydonius , this Lewcippa was so perfect in the complection of her bodie, and so pure in the constitution of her minde, so adorned with outwarde beautie, and endued with inward bountie, so pollished with rare vertues and exquisite qualities, as she seemed a seemely Venus for her beutie, and a second Vesta for her virginitie: yea, Nature and the Gods had so bountifullye bestowed their giftes vpon her, as Fame her selfe was doubtfull whether shee should make greater report of her excellent vertue, or exquisite beautie. But his sonne Guydonius was so contrarie to his sister Lewsippa , (though not in the state of his bodie, yet in the stay of his minde) as it made all men meruaile how two such contrarie stems could spring out of the selfe same stocke: His personage indeede was so comely, his feature so well framed, each lim so perfectlye couched, his face so faire, and his countenance so amiable, as he seemed a heauenly creature in a mortall carcasse. But his minde was so blemished with detestable qualyties, and so spotted with the staine of voluptuousnesse, that he was not so much to be commended for the proportion of his bodie, as to bee condempned for the imperfection of his minde. He was so endued with vanitie, and so imbrued wt vice, so nursed vp in wantonnesse, & so nusled vp in wilfulnesse, so carelesse to obserue his Fathers commaund, and so retchlesse to regard his counsell, that neither the dreade of Gods wrath, nor the feare of his fathers displeasure, could driue him to desist from his detestable kinde of liuing. Nay, there was no fact so filthy, which he would not commit, no mischiefe so monstrous, which he wold not enterprise: no daunger so desperate, which he would not aduenture: no perill so fearefull, which he would not performe: nor no action so diuellish, which he would not execute. So immodest in his manners, so rude in his iestures, yea, and so prodigall in his expences, as mines of golde were not able to maintaine such witlesse prodigalitie. This loathsome lyfe of Cwydonius was such a cutting corasiue to his Fathers carefull conscience, and such a haplesse clogge to his heauie heart, that no ioye could make him inioye anie ioye, no myrth could make him merrie, no prosperitie could make him pleasant, but abandoning all delyght, and auoyding all companie, he spent his dolefull daies in dumpes and dolors, which he vttered in these wordes. Now (quoth he) I proue by experience, the saying of Sophocles to be true, that the man which hath many children shall neuer liue without some myrth, nor dye without some sorrowe: for if they be vertuous, he shall haue cause whereof to reioyce, if vicious, wherefore to be sad, which saying I trie performed in my selfe, for as I haue one childe which delights me with her vertue, so I haue another that despights me with his vanitie, as the one by dutie brings me ioye, so the other by disobedience breeds my annoy: yea, as ye one is a comfort to my mind, so the other is a fretting corasiue to my heart: for what griefe is there more griping, what paine more pinching, what crosse more combersome, what plague more pernitious, yea, what trouble can torment me worse, then to see my sonne, mine heire, the inheritour of my Dukdome, which should be the piller of my parentage, to consume his time in roysting and ryot, in spending and spoiling, in swearing and swashing, and in following wilfullye the furie of his owne frantike fancie. Alasse, most miserable & lamentable case, would to God the destinyes had decreed his death in ye swadling clouts, or yt the fates had prescribed his end in his infacy. Oh yt the date of his birth had ben the day of his burial, or yt by some sinister storme of fortune he had ben stifled on his mothers knees, so that his vntimely death might haue preueted my ensuing sorowes, and his future calamities: for I see that ye young frie will alwayes proue olde frogges, yt the crooked twig will proue a crabbed tree, that the sower bud will neuer be sweete blossome, how that which is bredde by the bone wil not easily out of the flesh, that he which is carelesse in youth, will be lesse carefull in age, that where in prime of yeares vice raigneth, there in ripe age vanitie remaineth. Why Clerophontes , if thou seest the sore, why doest thou not applie the salue, and if thou dost perceiue the mischiefe, why doest not preuent it with medicine, take away the cause and the effect faileth, if Gwydones be the cause of thy ruth, cut him off betimes, least hee bring thee to ruine, better hadst thou want a sonne then neuer want sorow. Perhaps thou wilt suffer him so long till he fall sicke of the Father, and then he will not onely seeke thy lands and liuing, but life and all, if thou preuent not his purpose: yea, and after thy death he will be through his lasciuious lyfe the ouerthrowe of thy house, the consumer of thy Dukedome, the wracke of thy common weale, and the verie man that shall bring the state of Metelyne to mischiefe and miserie. Sith then thy sonne is such a sinke of sorrowes, in whose life lies hid a loathsome masse of wretched mishaps, cut him off as a gracelesse graft, vnworthie to growe out of such a stocke. Alasse Clerophontes , shalt thou bee so vnnaturall as to seeke the spoile of thine owne childe, wilt thou bee more sauage then the brute beasts in committing such crueltie, no, alasse the least misfortune of our children doth so moue vs, that as the Spider feeleth if her web be prickt but with the point of a pin, so if they be toucht but with the least trouble, we feele the paines thereof with prickking griefe to pinch vs. Why hath not nature then caused loue to ascend as wel as to descend, and placed as dutifull obedience in ye child, as louing affection in ye father: & with that he fetcht such a deep sigh, yt it was a signe of ye extreame sorrow he conceiued for his sons witlesse folly. But as he was readie againe to enter into his doleful discourse, to aggrauate his griefe the more, and increase his care, certaine complaints were brought him by sundrie Citizens, of the outragious behauiour of his sonne Gwydonius , which being attentiuely heard, he in great cholar called for his sonne, against whom he thundered out such threatning reproches, laying before his face the miserie that would insue of such recklesse mischiefes, & promising that if he directed not his course by a newe compasse, and leuelled his life by a new line, he woulde not onely repay his folly with the penaltie of the lawe, but also by consent of his Commons, disinherite him of his Dukedome: that Gwydonius greatly incensed with the seuere censure of his Father, broyling with furious rage, sturdely burst foorth into these stubborne tearmes. Sir , (quoth he) if Terence his Menedemus were aliue, and heard these your fond and fantasticall resons, he would as readely condemne you of crabbednes, as he accused Chremes of currishnesse: for as he by too much austeritie procured his sonnes mishappe, so you by too much seueritie seeke to breed my misfortune. You old men most iniustly, or rather iniuriously, measure our stailesse moode by your stayed mindes, our young yeres by your horie haires, our flourishing youth by your withered age, thinking to direct our dooings by your doatings, our wills by your wits, our youthfull fancies by your aged affections, and to quench our fierie flames by your dead coales and cinders: yea, supposing that the Leueret shuld be as skilfull in making of a head as the olde Hare, that the young Cubs shoulde as soone tapish, as ye old Fox, that ye young Frie shuld as wel auoid the net as the olde Fish, and that the young wantons shuld be as warie as the old wysards. But this sir, is to make fire frost, to chaunge heate to colde, mirth to mourning, singing to sadnesse, pleasure to paine, and to tye the Ape and the Beare in one tedder, sith then young stemmes will not be set on a withered stocke, that the young twigge liketh not vnder the old tree, that the toyish conceipts of youth are vnfit for the testie cogitations of age: I meane for your satisfaction and my solace, to departe from the Court, and to spend my dayes in trauell. Clerophontes no sooner heard this determination of his sonne Gwydonius , but his sorrow was halfe salued, and his care almost cured, thinking that by trauell hee should either ende his life or amend his lewdnesse, and therefore both hearted and hastened his sonne in this his newe course, least delay might breede daunger, or time by some toye cause him tourne his tippet, furnishing & finishing all things necessarie for his sonnes iourney, who readie to goe (more willing to trauell, than his father to intreate him) had this friendly farewell giuen him by Clerophontes . Sonne (quoth he) there is no greater doubt which dooeth more deepely distresse the minde of a young man, then to determine with himselfe what course of life is best to take, for there is such a confused Chaos of contrarie conceipts in young wits, that whiles they looke for that they cannot like, they are lost in such an endles Laberinth, as neither choice nor chance can draw the out to their wished desires, for so manie vaines so many vanities: if vertue draweth one way, vice driueth another way: as profit perswades the, so plesure prouokes them: as wit weigheth, will wresteth: if friends counsell them to take this, fancie forceth them to choose that: so that desire so long hangs in doubt, as either they choose none, or els chaunce on the worst. But in my opinion, the fittest kind of life for a young Gentleman to take (who as yet hath not subdued the youthfull conceipts of fancie, nor made a conquest of his will by witte) is to spende his time in trauell, wherein he shall finde both pleasure and profite: yea, and buye that by experience, which otherwise with all the treasure in the world hee cannot purchase. For what chaungeth vanitie to vertue, staylesse wit to stayed wisedome, fonde fantasies to firme affections, but trauell: what represseth the rage of youth, and redresseth the witlesse furie of wanton yeares, but trauell: what tourneth a secure life to a carefull lyuing, what maketh the foolish wise, yea, what increaseth wit and augmenteth skill, but trauell: in so much that the fame Vlysses wonne, was not by the tenne yeares hee laye at Troy , but by the time he spent in trauell. But there is nothing Gwydonius so precious which in some respecte is not perillous, nor nothing so pleasaunt which maye not be painefull: the finest golde hath hys drosse, the purest wine his lees, the brauest rose his prickles, each sweete hath his sower, each ioye his annoy, each weale his woe, and euerie delyght his daunger. So trauaile Gwydonius is a course of life verie pleasant, and yet very perillous, wherin thou mayst practise vertue if thou take heede, or purchase discredite if thou beest carelesse: where thou maist reape renowne if thou beest vertuous, and gaine reproch if thou be vicious: whereout doo spring wisedome and folly, freedome and bondage, treasure and trash, fame and discredite, honour & shame, according to the disposition of him which eyther vseth it to his profit, or abuseth it to his discommoditie. Sith then thou shalt beare sayle in such perillous Strayghtes, take heede least thou dash thy ship agaynst most daungerous Rockes. It is a saying Gwydonius , not so common as true, that hee which will heare the Syrens sing, must with Vlysses tye himselfe to the mast of a ship, least happely he be drowned. Who so meanes to be a sutor to Circes , must take a Preseruatiue, vnlesse he will be inchaunted. He that will fish for ye Torpedo , must annoynt his hand with the oyle of Nemiphar , least he be charmed, & who so meaneth to enter combat with vanitie, must first surely defence himselfe with the target of vertue, vnlesse hee meane to be a captiue to care, or calamitie. I speak this Gwydonius by experience, which afterwarde thou shalt know by proofe, for in trauell thou shalt finde such subtill Syrens as will indaunger thee, such sorcering Cirees as will inchaunt thee, such poysoned Torpedos , as will not onely charme thy hand but thy heart, if by my experience and other mens perils thou learn not to beware. First Gwydonius , be not too sumptuous least thou seeme prodigall, nor too couetous least they compt thee a niggard: for by spending in excesse thou shalt be thought a vainglorious foole, and by too much sparing a couetous pesant. Be not wilfull in thy dooings that they count thee not witlesse, nor too rash, that they think thee not deuoyd of reason: be not too merrie that they count thee not immodest, nor too sober least they call thee sullen, but shew thy selfe to be an olde man for thy grauitie, and a young youth for thy actiuitie: so shal all men haue cause to praise thee for thy manners, and commend thee for thy modestie. Be not too curious Guydonius , that they deeme thee not proud, nor too curteous, least they call thee counterfaite. Be a friend to all, & a foe to none, and yet trust not without triall, nor commit any secret to a friendlye stranger, least in too much trust lye treason, and thou be forced by repentaunce to crie Peccaui . The sweetest Muske is sower to be tasted, the finest Pils most bitter to be chewed, and the flattering friend most tickle being tried, then beware least faire words make fooles faine, & glozing speeches cause had I wist come too late. Lende not Gwydonius a listning eare to the Alarums of loue, nor yeeld not thy freedome to the assault of lust, be not dazeled with the beames of fading beautie, nor daunted with the desire of euery delicat damsell, for in time such blisse will proue but bane, and such delightfull ioye, but despitefull annoye. Lust Gwydonius will prooue an enimie to thy pursse, and a foe to thy person, a canker to thy minde, and a corasiue to thy conscience, a weakner of thy wit, a molester of thy minde, a besotter of thy sences, and finally a mortall bane to all thy body, so that thou shalt find pleasure the pathway to perdition, and lusting Loue the load-stone to ruth and ruine. Seeke not then Gwydonius greedely to deuour that baite, where-vnder thou knowest a hurtful hook to be hidden: frequent not ye plesure which wil turn to thy poyson, nor couet not ye copanie, which will conuert to thy confusion, least through such follye thou haue cause in time to bee sadde, and I to be sorrowfull. Now Gwydonius that thou hast heard the aduertisement of a louing father, follow my aduice as a duetifull Childe, and the more to binde thee to perfourme my former preceptes, that this my counsaile be not drowned in obliuion, I giue thee this King of gold, wherein is written this sentence, Praemonitus, Praemunitus . A Posie pretie for the wordes, and pithie for the matter, shorte to bee rehearsed, and long to bee related, inferring this sence, that he which is fore-warned by friendlye counsayle of imminent daungers, is fore-armed against all future mishappe and calamitie, so that hee maye by fore-warning preuent perills if it be possible, or if by sinister fortune he cannot eschew them, yet hee maye beare the Crosse with more patience and lesse griefe. Keepe this King Gwydonius carefully, that thou maist shew thy selfe to respect thy owne case, and regarde my counsaile: and in so dooing thou shalt please me, and pleasure thy selfe. fatherlye affection, and giuing him his blessing, went secretlye into his Chamber the more to couer his griefe which hee conceyued for his sonnes departure: vnwilling his sonne should perceyue by his sorrowe how vnfainedly he both liked and loued him. Well , Gwydonius hauing taken his leaue of his father, furnished both with counsell and coyne, with aduice of wisedome and ayde of wealth, passed on his iourney very solempnly, vntill he was past the bounds of his fathers Dukedome, and then as merrie as might be he trauayled by the space of seauen weekes without anye residence, vntill he came to a Citie called Barutta , where (whether he were delighted with the scituation of the place, or deluded with the perswasion of some Parasiticall persons) he securelye setteled himselfe by the space of a whole yeare: in which time hee so carelesly floated in the seas of voluptuousnesse, and so recklesselye raunged in lycentious and lawlesse lybertie, thinking himselfe a peasaunt if hee were not prodigall, counting nothing comelye if not costlye, nothing seemelye if not sumptuous, vsing such monstrous excesse in all his actions, that the Citizens of Barutta noted him for a myrrour if immoderate lyfe, and a verye patterne of witlesse prodigalitie: yea, his excessiue expences daylye so increased, that Mynes of golde had not bene sufficient to mayntaine his pompous magnificence, in so much that the Magistrates of Barutta , not onelye meruayled where hee hadde coyne to counteruayle his expences, but also beganne to suspecte him eyther for some skilfull Alcumist, or that hee had some large Commission to take vp those pursses that fell into lapse, for want of sufficient defence: wherevppon beeing called before the Magistrates and stricktlye examined what Trade hee vsed, why hee stayed so long, in the Citie, and howe hee was able to mayntayne so Princelye a porte as hee carryed? Guydonius vnwillyng to haue them priuye to his Parentage, beganne to coyne a scuse, yet not so cunninglye but hee was trapte in his owne talke, and so caste in Prisonne, where hee laye clogged with care, and deuoyd of comforte, hauing not so much as one trustye friende, amongest all those trothlesse flatterers which in prosperitie hadde so frequented his companye, the ingratitude of whome, so perplexed his molested minde, as surcharged with sorrowe, hee burst foorthe into these tearmes. Alas (quoth hee) now haue I bought that by haplesse experience, which if I hadde bene wyse, I might haue gotte by happye counsayle: Nowe am I taught that with payne and perill, which if selfe-loue hadde not besotted my sences, I myght haue learned with profitte and pleasure: that in the fayrest Sandes is most ficklenesse, out of the brauest Blossome moste commonlye springeth the woorste Fruite, that the finest Flower seldome hath the best smell, that the moste glystering Stone hath oftentymes the leaste vertue, and that in the greatest shew of good wyll lyes ofte times the smallest effecte of friendshippe, in moste flatterye leaste fayth, in the fairest face the falsest hearte, in the smoothest Tale the smallest Truth, and in the sweetest gloses moste sower ingratitude: Yea, I see nowe (quoth hee) that in trust lyes treason, that fayre woordes make fooles fayne, and that the state of these fayned friendes are lyke to the Marygolde, which as longe as the Sunne shyneth openeth her leaues, but with the leaste Clowde beginneth to cloase, lyke the Uyolettes in America , which in Summer yeelde an odoriferous smell, and in Winter a most pestilent sauour: so these Parasites in prosperitie professe most, but in aduersitie perfourme least: when Fortune fauoureth they laugh, when shee frowneth they lowre: at euerye full Sea they flowrish, but at euerye deade Neape they fade: Like to the Fish Palerna , which beeing perfectlye white in the Calme, yet tourneth passing blacke at euerye storme: to the Trees in the Desartes of Affrica , that flourish but while the South winde bloweth, or to the Celedony stone, which retaineth his vertue no longer than it is rubbed with golde. Sith then Gwydonius , (quoth hee) thou findes such falsehoode in friendshippe, and such faythles deedes in such paynted speaches, shake off these fawning curres with the flagge of deflaunce, and from hencefoorth trye ere thou trust. I, but (quoth hee) it is too late to applye the salue when the sore is incurable to crye alarum when the Citie is ouer-runne, to seeke for couerte when the storme is past, and to take heede of such flattering mates when alreadie thou art deceyued by such fawning Marchauntes: nowe thou wilte crye Caue when thy coyne is consumed, and beware when thy wealth is wracked, when thou hast nothing wherof to take charge, thou wilt be chary, and when follye hath alreadie giuen thee a mate, thou wilt by wisedome seeke to auoyde the checke, but nowe thou tryest it true, that thy Father foretolde thee, that so long thou wouldest bee carelesse, as at last Repentaunce woulde pull thee by the sleeue, and then had I wyst would come to late. Wel Gwydonius , sith that which is once past can neuer be recald againe, if thou hast by follie made a fault, seeke by wisdome to make amends,  & heap not care vpo care, nor adde not griefe to sorrow, by these thy pittifull complaints, but cheere vp thy selfe and take heart at grasse, for the end of woe is the beginning of weale, & after miserie alwaies insueth most happie felicitie. Gwydonius hauing thus dolorously discoursed wyth himselfe, remained not aboue ten dayes in prison, but that the Senate taking pittie of his case, and seeing no accusations were inferred against him, set him free from his Purgatorie, and gaue him good counsaile that heereafter he shoulde beware by such witlesse prodigalitie to incurre such suspition. Theseus neuer triumphed more after he had escaped the daunger of the perillous laborinth, then poore Gwydonius did whe he was set free from this pernitious Limbo, now the bitternesse of bondage made his freedome seeme farre more sweete, and his daunger so happily escaped, caused his deliuerie seeme far more delightfull. Yet he conceiued such discourtesie against the Citizens, for repaying his liberall good will with such loathsome ingratitude, that the next morning he departed from Barutta , not stored with too much mony for molesting his minde, nor ouercharged with coine for combering his conscience with too much care, but hauing remaining of all his treasure onely that ring which his father gaue him, trauailing verie solempnly toward Alexandria . Where at that time there raigned a certaine Duke named Orlanio , who was so famous and fortunate, for the peaceable gouernment of his Dukedome, administering iustice with such sinceritie, and yet tempering the extremitie of the lawe with such lenitie, as hee both gained the good will of straungers in hearing his vertue, & wonne the heartes of his subiectes in feeling his bountie, counting him vnworthye to beare the name of a Soueraigne, which knewe not according to desert, both to cherish and chastise his subiects. Fortune and the fates willing to place him in the pallace of earthly prosperitie, endued him with two children, the one a sonne named Thersandro , & the other a Daughter called Castania , eyther of them so adorned with the giftes of Nature, and beautified with good nurture, as it was hard to knowe whether beautie or vertue held the supremacie. But least by this happie estate Orlanio should be too much puffed vp with prosperitie, Fortune sparing him the mate, yet gaue him a slender checke, to warne him from securitie, for before his daughter came to the age of fourteene yeeres, his wife dyed, leauing him not more sorrowfull for the losse of her whom he most entirely loued, then carefull for the well bringing vp of her whome he so deerely lyked. Knowing that as his Court was a Schoole of vertue to such as brideled their mindes with discreation, so it was a nurse of vice to those tender yeeres that measured theyr willes wyth witlesse affection, esteeming lybertie as perillous to the staie of youth, as precious to the state of age, and that nothing so soone allured the minde of a younge maide to vanitie, as to passe her youth without feare in securitie. Feared with the consideration of these premisses, to auoyde the inconueniences that might happen by suffering Castania to leade her lyfe in lawlesse libertie, hee thought it best to choose out some vertuous Ladie to keepe her companie, who might directe her course by so true a compasse, and leuell her lyfe by so right a lyne, that although her young yeares were verie apt to bee intangled in the snares of vanitie, yet by her counsell & companie, shee might steddelye tread her steppes in the trace of vertue, and none hee coulde finde more fitte for the purpose then a certaine olde Widdowe, called Madame Melytta , honored for her vertuous life throughout all Alexandria , who beeing sent for to the Court, he saluted on this manner. Madame Melytta (quoth hee) the reporte of thy honest conditions, and the renowme of thy vertuous qualyties are such, as thereby thou hast not onely purchased greate praise, but wonne greate credite throughout all the Countrie. Insomuch that I incensed by this thy singular commendation, I haue selected thee as the onely woman to whome I meane to commit my chiefest treasure, I meane Melytta , my Daughter Castania , to whome I wyll haue thee bee both a companion and a counseller, hoping thou wilt take such care to traine her vp in vertue, and trace her quite from vice, to winne her minde to honestie, and weane her quite from vanitie, that shee in her ripe yeares shall haue cause to thanke thee for thy paines, and I occasion to regarde thee as a friende, and rewarde thee for thy dilygence. First Melytta , so that shee leade her lyfe both charylye and chastly. Let her not haue her owne wyll, least shee prooue too wilfull, nor too much lybertie, least shee become too lyght. The Palme tree pressed downe, groweth notwythstanding but too faste. The Hearbe Spattania , though troden on, groweth verie tall, and youth although stricktlye restrained wyll prooue but too stubburne. The vessell sauoureth alwayes of that lycour wherewith it was first seasoned, and the minde retayneth those qualyties in age wherein it was trayned vp in youth. The tender twigge is sooner broken then the strong braunch, the young stemme more brittle then the olde stocke, the weake Bramble shaken with euerye Winde, and the wauering wyll of youth tossed with euerie puffe of vanitie, readie to be wracked in the waues of wantonnesse, vnlesse it be cunninglye guided by some wise and warie Pylot. Then Melytta , youth is so easily intrapped with the alluring traine of foolish delights, and so soone intangled with the trash of pernitious pleasures, suffer not my daughter to passe her time in idlenesse, least happily being taken at discouert, she become a carelesse captiue to securitie (for whe the mind once floteth in ye surging seas of idle conceits, then the puffes of voluptuous pleasures, and the stiffeling stormes of vnbridled fancie, the raging blasts of alluring beautie, and the sturdy gale of glozing vanitie, so shake the ship of recklesse youth, that it is daily in doubt to suffer most daungerous shipwracke. But let her spend her time in reading such auncient authors as may sharpen her wit by their pithie sayings, & learne her wisedome by their perfect sentences. For where nature is vicious, by learning it is amended, and where it is vertuous, by skill it is augmented. The stone of secret vertue is of greater price if it be brauely polished, th golde though neuer so pure of himselfe, hath the better coulour if it be burnished, and the minde though neuer so vertuous, is more noble if it be inriched with the gifts of learning. And Melytta for recreation sake, let her vse such honest sportes as may driue awaie dumps, least she be too pensiue, & free her mind from foolish conceites, yt she be not too wanton. Thus Madame as you haue heard my fatherly aduise, so I praie you giue my daughter the like friendly aduertisement, yt heereafter she may haue both cause to reuerence thee, and I to reward thee. Melytta hauing heard with attentiue heede the mind of Orlanio , conceiued such ioy in this new charge, & such delight in this happie chaunce, as with cheerefull countenance she repaid him this aunswere. Sir (quoth she) although in the largest Seas are the forest tempestes, in the broadest wayes most boysterous windes, in the highest hilles, most daungerous happes, and in the greatest charge the greatest care, yet the duetie which I owe you as my Soueraigne, and the loue I beare you as a subiect, the care I haue to please you as my Prince, and to pleasure you as a Potentate, the trust you repose in my truth without sufficient tryall, ye confidence you put in my conscience without sure proofe, the courtesie your grace dooth shewe mee without anie desert, haue so inflamed the forepassed fire of duetifull affection, and so incouraged mee to incounter your graces courtesie, with willing constancie, that ther is no happe so harde which I woulde not hazard, no daunger so desperate which I woulde not aduenture, no burthen so heauie which I woulde not beare, no perill so huge which I would not passe, nor no charge so greate, which both willingly and warily I would not performe. For, since it hath pleased your grace to vouchsafe so much of my simple calling, as to assigne me for a companion for your Daughter Castania , I will take such care in the charie performaunce of my charge, and indeauour with such diligence both to counsell and comfort Castania , as your grace shall perceiue my dutie in pleasing you, and my diligence in pleasuring her. The Duke hearing the friendly and faythfull protestation of the good Ladie Melytta , tolde her that although it were great trouble for one of her age to frame her selfe as a companion to such young youth, and that some care belonged to such a charge, yet hee woulde so counteruaile her painefull labour with princely lyberalitie, that both she and all Alexandria should haue cause to speake of his bountie. householde affaires in good order, repaired to the Court as speedely as might be. But leauing her with Castania , againe to Cwydonius . Who now beeing aryued at Alexandria , pinched wyth pouertie and distressed with want, hauing no coyne left wherewith to counteruaile his expences, thought it his best course, if it were possible, to compasse the Dukes seruice, repairing therefore to the Court, he had not staied there three dayes before hee found fit opportunitie to offer his seruice to Orlanio , whome verie duetifully hee saluted on this manner. Tye report (right worthie Prince) of your incomparable courtesie and pearlesse magnanimitie, is so blazed abroade throughout all Countries, by the golden trumpe of Fame, that your grace is not more loued of your subiects which tast of your liberall bounty, then honoured of straungers, which onely heare of your princely vertue. Insomuch that it hath forced me to leaue my natiue soile, my parents, kindred, and familiar friendes, and pilgrimelyke to passe into a straunge Countrie, to trie that by experience heere, which I haue heard by report at home. For it is not (right worthie sir) the state of your Countrie which hath allured me (for I deeme Bohemia , whereof I am, no lesse pleasant then Alexandria , neither hath want of liuing) or hope of gaine intised me, for I am by birth a Gentleman, and issued of such parents as are able with sufficient patrimonie to maintaine my estate, but the desire, not onely to see, but also to learne such rare curtesie and vertuous qualities as fame hath reported to be put in practise in your Court, is the onely occasion of this my iourney. Now if in recompence of this my trauaile, it shall please your grace to vouchsafe of my seruice, I shall thinke my selfe fully satisfied, and my paines sufficiently requited. Orlanio hearing this dutifull discourse of Gwydonius , marking his manners, and musing at his modestie, noting both his excellent curtesie and exquisite beautie, was so inflamed with friendlye affection towarde this young youth, that not onely he accepted of his seruice, but also preferred him as a companion to his sonne Thesandro , promising that since he had left his Countrie and parents for this cause, he would so counteruaile his dutifull desert with fauour and friendshippe, as he shoulde neuer haue cause to accuse him of ingratitude. Gwydonius repaying heartie thankes to the Duke for his vndeserued curtesie, beeing nowe brought from woe to weale, from despaire to hope, from bale to blisse, from care to securitie, from want to wealth, yea, from hellish miserie, to heauenly prosperitie, behaued himselfe so wisely and warily, with such curtesie in conuersation, and modestie in manners, that in short time hee not hnely purchased credite and countenaunce wyth Orlanio , but was most entirely liked & loued of Thersadro . Now there remained in the Court a young knight, called Signor Valericus , who by chaunce casting his glauncing eies on the glittering beautie of Castania , was so fettered in the snare of fancie, and so intangled with the trap of affection, so perplexed in the Laborinth of pinching loue, and so inchaunted with the charme of Venus Sorcerie, that as the Elephant reioyceth greatly at the sight of a rose, as ye bird Halciones delighteth to view ye feathers of the Phoenix , and as nothing better contenteth a Roe buck, then to gaze at a red cloth, so ther was no obiect that could allure the wauering eies of Valericus , as the surpassing beautie of Castania , yea, his onely blisse, pleasure, ioy, and delight, was in feeding his fancie with staring on the heauenlye face of his Goddesse. But alasse her beautie bredde his bane, her lookes, his losse, her sight his sorowe, her exquisite perfections, his extreame passions, that as the Ape by seeing the Snaile, is infected, as the Leoparde falleth in a traunce at the sight of the Locust, as the Cockatrice dyeth with beholding the Chrisolito, so poore Valericus was pinched to the heart with viewing her comely countenaunce, was griped with galding griefe, and tortured with insupportable tormentes, by gasing vppon the gallant beautie of so gorgeous a dame. Yea, he so framed in his fancie the forme of her face, and so imprinted in his heart the perfection of hir person, that the remembrance thereof would suffer him take no rest, but he passed the daie in dolour, the night in sorrow, no minute without mourning, no houre without heauinesse, that falling into pensiue passions, he began thus to parle with himselfe. Why how now Valericus (quoth hee) art thou haunted with some hellish hagge, or possessed with some frantike fury, art thou inchanted with some magical charme, or charmed with some bewitching Sorcerie, that so sodainely thy minde is perplexed with a thousand sundrie passions, alate free, and now fettered, alate swimming in rest, and now sinking in care, erewhile in securitie, & now in captiuitie, yea, turned from mirth to mourning, fro plesure to paine, from delight to despight, hating thy selfe, and louing her who is the chiefe cause of this thy calamitie Ah Valericus , hast thou forgot the saying of Propertius , that to loue howsoeuer it be, is to loose, and to fancie howe charie so euer thy choice be, is to haue an ill chaunce, for Loue though neuer so fickle, is but a Chaos of care, and fancie, though neuer so fortunate, is but a masse of miserie, for if thou inioye the beautie of Venus , thou shalt finde it small vauntage, if thou gette one as wise as Minerua , thou mayst put thy winninges in thine eye, if as gorgeous as Iuno thy accompts being cast, thy gaine shall be but losse: yea, be shee vertuous, be she chast, be she courteous, be she constant, be she rich, be she renowmed, be she honest, be she honourable, yet if thou be wedded to a woman, thinke thou shalt finde in her sufficient vanitie to counteruaile her vertue, that thy happinesse will be matcht with heauinesse, thy quiet with care, thy contentation with vexation: that thou shalt sowe seede with sorrowe, and reape thy corne with sadnesse, that thou shalt neuer liue without griefe, nor dye without repentaunce, for in matching with a wife ther is such mischifes, and in mariage such miseries, that Craterus the Emperour wishing some sinister Fortune to happen vpon one of his foes, prayed vnto the Gods, that he might be maried in his youth, and dye without issue in his age, counting mariage such a combersome crosse, and a wife such a pleasant plague, that he thought his foe could haue no worse torment, than to be troubled with such noysome trash. Oh Valericus , if the consideration of these premisses be not sufficient to perswade thee: if the sentence of Propertius cannot quench thy flame, nor the saying of Craterus coole thy fancie: call to minde what miseries, what mischiefes, what woes, what wailings, what mishappes, what murders, what care, what calamities haue happened to such, as haue bene besotted with the balefull beautie of women, enioying more care than commoditie, more payne than profite, more cost than comfort, more greefe than good: yea, reaping a tunne of drosse, for euery dramme of perfect golde. What carelesse inconstancie ruled Eriphila ? what currish crueltie raigned in Philomela ? how incestuous a life lead Aeuropa ? and how miserable was that man that married Stheuolea ? What gaines got Tereus in winning Progne ? but a loathsome death for a little delight. Agamemnon in possessing the beautie of Crecida , caused the Grecian armie most greeuously to be plagued. Candaules was slaine by his murdering wife, whom so intyrely hee loued. Who was thought more happy than the husbande of Helena , and yet who in time lesse fortunate? What haplesse chaunces insued of the chastitie of Penelope ? what broyles in Rome by the vertue of Lucretia ? the one caused her sutours most horriblye to be slayne, and the other that Tarquin and all his posteritie were rooted out of their Regall dignities. Phaedra in louing killed her haples sonne Hippolitus , & Clitemnestra in hating slew her louing husband Agamemnon . Alas Valericus , how dangerous is it then to deale with such Dames? which if they loue, they procure thy fatall care: and if they hate thee, thy finall calamitie. But ah blasphemous beast yt I am, thus recklesly to raile & rage without reason, thus currishly to exclayme agaynst those without whome our life though neuer so luckly, should seeme most loathsome, thus Tymon lyke, to condempne those heauenlye creatures, whose onely sight is a sufficient salue against all hellish sorrowes: is this right, to conclude generallye of perticular premisses, is it Iustice to accuse all for the offence of some, is it equitie to blame the staye of vertuous women, for the state of vicious wantons? Doost thou thinke Valericus to shake off the shackles of fancie with this folly? or to eschewe the baite of beautie, by breathing out such blasphemie? No, no, assure thy selfe, that these thy raging reasons, will in tune be most rigorouslye reuenged, that the Gods themselues will plague thee for braying out such iniurious speaches. Alas, Loue wanting desire, maketh the minde desperate: and fixed fancie bereaued of hope, tourneth into furye. The loyall faith I beare to Castania , and the loathsome feare of her ingratitude, the deepe desire which inforceth my hope, and the deadlye despayre which infringeth my happe, so tosseth my minde with contrarie cogitations, that I neyther regarde what I saye, to my harme, nor respecte what I doo, to my owne hurte: yea, my sences are so besotted with pinching Loue, and my minde so fretted with frying fancie, that death were thrice more welcome, than thus to linger in despayring hope. And with that, to passe awaye those pensiue passions, hee floung out of his Chamber with his Hawke on his fiste, thinking by suche sporte to dryue awaye this melancholycke humour, which so molested his minde. But as hee was passing thorough the Courte, hee was luckelye incountered by Melitta and Castania , who minding to haue some sporte with Valericus before hee did passe: had the onset thus pleasauntly giuen him by Castania . It is harde Signor Valericus (quoth she) to take you either without your Hawke on your fiste, or your heart on your halfepenie, for if for recreation you be not retriuing the Partridge with dogs, you are in solemne meditation driuing away the time with dumpes, neyther caring for companie to solace your sadnesse, nor plesantly discoursing of some amorous Parle : which makes the Gentlewomen of this Court thinke, that you are either an Apostata to Loue, as was Narcyssus , or haue displayed the flagge of defiaunce against Fancie, as did Tyanaeus . If these their surmised coniectures be true Valericus , I warne thee as a friend to beware by other mens harmes, least if thou imitate their actions, thou be mangled with the like miserie, or maymed with the like misfortune. Valericus hearing his Saint pronouncing this sugred harmonie, feeling himselfe somewhat toucht with this quipping talke, was so rapte in admiration of her eloquence, and so rauisht in the contemplation of hir beautie, that he stoode in a maze not able to vtter one word, vntil at last gathering his wits together, he burst foorth into these speaches. Madame (quoth he) what it pleaseth the Gentlewomen of this Court to surmise of my solytarinesse I knowe not, but if they attribute it too curiousnesse, or coynesse to strangenesse, or statelinesse, either that I am an enimie to loue, or a foe to fancie, that I detest theyr bountie with Narcissus , or contempne their beautie with Tiancus , they offer me great iniurie, so rashly to coniecture of my disease, before rightly they haue cast my water. But to put your Ladiship out of doubt what is the cause of my dumpes, so it is that of late raunging the fieldes, my heart (my hawke I shoulde say Madame) houered at such a princely pray, and yet myst of her flight, that since she hath neither prunde her selfe, nor I taken anye pleasure. Marie if the fates should so fauour me, or fortune so shrowde me vp in prosperitie, that my desire might obtayne her wish, I would not onely change my mourning to mirth, my dolour to delight, and my care to securitie, but I would thinke to haue gotten as rich a pray as euer Caesar gaind by conquest. Surely Signor Valericus (quoth Melitta ) no doubt the pray is passing princely, since the valew thereof is rated at so precious a price, and therefore we haue neither cause to condempne your Hawke of haggardnesse, for want of pruning, nor you of foolyshnesse for want of pleasure. And if your heart (your hawke I should saye Signor Valericus ) hath reacht farther with her eye, than she is able to mount with her wing, although I am no skilfull Fawlconer, yet I thinke you had better keepe her on the fist still and so feede her with hope, then let her misse agayne of her flyght, and so she tourne tayle and bee foyled. In deede Madame (quoth Valericus ) your counsaile is very good, for as there is no better confect to a crazed minde, than hope, so there is no greater corasiue to a carefull man than despaire, and the Fawlchoners also iumpe with you in the same verdite, that the Hawke which misseth her praye, is doubtfull to soare aloofe and prooue haggard. Yet if she were so tickle, as she would take no stande, so ramage as she woulde be reclaymed with no lure, I had rather happely hazarde her for the gayning of so peerelesse a praye, though I both lost her and wanted of my wish: than by keeping her still in the Bynes to prooue her a kyte, or me a coward. In deede Sir (quoth Castania ), Fortune euer fauoreth them that are valyant, and things the more hard, the more haughtie, hie and heauenly: neyther is anye thing harde to be accomplished, by him that hardelye enterpriseth it. But yet take heede that you fishe not so fayre, that at length you catche a Frogge, and then repentaunce make you mumble vp a masse with Miserere. No Madame (quoth he) it is neuer seene that hee which is contented with his chaunce, should euer haue cause to repent him of his choyce. And yet (quoth she) hee that buyes a thing to deere maye be content with his chaffer, and yet wish he had bene more charie. Truth Madame, (quoth Valericus ) but then it is trash and no treasure, for that which is precious is neuer ouerprised, and a bad thing though neuer so cheape is thought too chargeable. Oh Sir (quoth Melytta ) and is it not an old saying, that a man maye buye golde too deare, and that Iewells, though neuer so precious maye bee set at too high a price. I see if you had no better skill in manning of a Hawke, than in making of a bargaine, you would prooue but an ill Fawlchoner. But since we haue so long troubled you with our talk, we wil now leaue you to your sport, and so bid you farewell. Valericus with a courteous Conge repaying theyr courtesie, and with a glauncing eye giuing hys Goddesse the dolefull A dio , went solytarily into the secret woods, wher laying him downe in the shade, he fell into these musing meditations. What greater prosperitie (quoth he) can happen vnto any earthlye wight, than if he be crossed with care, to finde a confect to cure his calamitie: then if hee be pinched with paines, to get a playster for his passions: if he be drenched in distresse, to finde a meanes to mitigate his miserye, which I see by proofe perfourmed in my seelye selfe: for the sight of my Goddesse hath so salued my fore-passed sorrowes, her sweete words hath so healed my heauye woundes, that where before I was plunged in perplexitie, I am nowe placed in felicitie: where before I was oppressed with care, I am now refreshed with comfort. O friendly Fortune, if from hencefoorth thou furiouslye frowne vppon mee, if thou daunt me with disaster mishappe, or crosse mee with perpetuall care, yet this thy friendlye courtesie shall bee sufficient to counteruayle all future enormityes. But alas, I see euery prosperous puffe hath his boysterous blaste, euerye sweete hath his sower, euerye weale his woe, euerye gale of good lucke his storme of sinister Fortune: yea, euerye commoditie his discommoditie annexed: the bloud of the Uiper is most healthfull for the sight, and most hurtfull for the stomacke, the stone Celonites is very precious for the backe, and very perillous to the braine: the flower of India pleasaunt to be seene, but who so smelleth to it, feeleth present smart: so as the ioye of her presence procureth my delight, the annoye of her absence breedeth my despight: yea, the feare that she will not repaye my loue with lyking, and my fancie with affection, that she wil not consent to my request, but rather meanes to stiffle me with the raging stormes of repulse, and daunt me with the doome of deadly denialles, so fretteth my haplesse minde with hellish furie, that no plague, no paine, no torment, no torture can worse molest me, than to be distressed with this dreadfull despaire. Alas, her callyng is too high for me to clymbe vnto, her royall state is farre aboue my reach, her haughtie minde is too loftie for me to aspyre: no doubt if I offer my sute vnto her she will prooue like the Stone of Silicia , which the more it is beaten the harder it is: or like the spices of Ionia , which the more they are pounded the lesse sauour they yeelde, lyke to the Isiphilon , which yeeldeth foorth no iuyce though neuer so well brused: so, though I shoulde with neuer so great deuotion offer vp at her Shrine, prayers, promises, sighes, sobbes, teares, troth, faith, freedome, yea, and my heart it selfe, as a pledge to pleade for pitie, yet she would make so small accompt of these my cares, and as lyttle regarde my ruth and ruine, as Eriphila did her faithfull friend Infortunio. But oh vilde wretch that I am, why doo I thus with out cause condempne Castania , why doo I accuse her of crueltie, in whome raigneth nothing but courtesie? why doo I appeach her of coynesse, in whome bountie sheweth small curiousnesse? How friedly, how familiarly, yea how faithfully did she talke with me, what a cheerefull countenaunce did shee carrie towardes me, what sodaine glaunces, what louely lookes, which no doubt are signes that though she repulse me at the first, she will not refuse me at the last: though she be straight in words, she wil not be strange in minde: though she giue me some bitter pilles of deniall, it shall be but for the better tryall. And shall I then beeing fedde with this hope prooue such a meacocke or a milkesoppe as to be feared with the tempestuous Seas of aduersitye, when as at lenghth I shall arriue at the Hauen of happie estate: shall I dread to haue my shippe shaken with some angrie blastes, hoping to bee safelye landed on the shoare, and so haue my share of that, which the showers of shrewde Fortune for a time hath denied me. No, no, Dulcia non meruit, qui non gustauit amara . Hee is not worthye to sucke the sweete, which hath not first sauoured the sower: hee is not worthie to eate the kernell which hath not crackt the shell, hee deserueth not to haue the crowne of victorye, which hath not abidde the brunt of the Battaile: he meriteth not to possesse the praye, whih will not willyngly take some parte of the payne: Neyther is hee worthye of so heauenlye a Dame as Castania , that woulde not spende the most precious bloud in his bodye, in the pursute of so peerelesse a peece. rooting out the dead flesh of despayre with the Playster of trust, determyned to stryke on the Stythe whyle the yron was hotte, and to pursue his purpose whyle his Mystresse was in her good moode. And therefore leauing his sporte for this time, hied him to the Court in hast: where insinuating himselfe into the societie of the Ladies and gentlewomen, hee shewed himselfe in sport so pleasaunt, in talke so wittie, in manners so modest, in conceits so cunning, in parle so pithie,  & in all his conuersation so comely, that whereas before hee was specially loued of none, now he was generally lyked of all: insomuch that for a time there was no talke in the Court but of the Metamorphosis of Valericus minde. Who often times determining in plaine tearmes to present his sute to Castania , when he came to the point, feare of offence and dreade of deniall, disappointed his purpose, that he remained mute in the matter: but at last perceiuing delaie bred daunger, seeing his mistresse sit alone in his presence, houering betweene feare and hope, he began the assault with this march. Madame (quoth hee) for that I see you sitting thus solitarie in dumps. I am the bolder to prease in place, although the most vnworthie man to supplie it. Hoping you will pardon my rudenesse for troubling thus rashly your musing meditations, and count my companie the lesse offensiue in that I see you busied with no such seryous matters whervnto my presence may be greatly preiudiciall. Cyneas the Philosopher, Madame, was of this minde, that when the Gods made beautie, they skipt beyond their skill, in that they framed it of greater force then they themselues were able to resist, if then there is none so wise or worthie whome beautie cannot wracke, nor none issued of such princely birth, whom beutie cannot bend, though I haue bene intangled with the snare of fancie, and haue listened to the lure of beautie, I am the more to be borne with, and the lesse to bee blamed. For I must of force confesse Madame, that the giftes of nature so abundauntly bestowed vpon you, your excellent beutie and exquisite vertue, haue so scaled the wals of my fancie, and sacked the fort of my treedome, that for my last refuge I am forced to appeale vnto your courtesie, as the onely medicine which may cure my intollerable disease. Nay incurable I may well call it, for (I speake with teares outwardly, and droppes of bloud inwardly) vnlesse the missing showers of your mercye mittigate the fire of my fancie, the drops of your princely fauour quench the flame of my affection, and the guerdon of your good will giue a soueraigne Playster for my secrete sore, I am lyke to passe my lyfe in more miserie, then if I had taken the infernall tormentes. But I hope it is not possible, that out of a Sugered Fount shoulde distill a bitter streame, out of a fragraunt flower a filthie sappe, and from such diuine beautie shoulde proceede hate and hellish crueltie. It is Madame your beautie which hath wrought my woe, & it is your bountie which must worke my weale. It is your heauenly face which hath depriued mee of lybertie, and your curteous consent must bee the meanes to redeeme mee from captiuitie: for as hee that eateth of the Briane leafe, and is infected, can by no meanes bee cured, vnlesse hee taste of the same roote: As hee which is wounded of the Porcuntine, canne neuer bee healed vnlesse his woundes bee washt with the bloude of the same beast, as there is nothing better against the sting-of a Snake, then to bee rubbed with an Adders slough, and as hee which is hurt of the Scorpion seeke a salue from whome hee receiued the sore, so Loue onely is remedied by Loue, and fancie by mutuall affection: You madame must minister the medicine, which procured the maladie, and it onely lies in your power to applie the plaister which inferred the paine. Therefore I appeale to your good grace and fauour, and at the barre of your beautie I humblie holde vp my handes, resting to abide your sentence, either of consent vnto life, or of deniall vnto death. maze with this vnlookt for motion, musing that he would so farre ouershoote himselfe, as to attempt so vnlikelye a match, and therefore with disdainefull countenaunce shee gaue gim this daunt. As your present ariuall Signor Valericus , dooth not greatly preiudice my muses, so I thinke it will as little profit your motion, and as your companie pleaseth me regarding the person, so it much misliketh me, respecting the parle : that your countes beeing once cast, you shall finde your absence might haue more pleasured you, and better contented mee. For it is vnpossible Valericus to call the Fawlcon to that Lure wherin the pennes of a Camelion are pricked, because shee dooth deadly detest them, it is harde to traine the Lyon to that trappe which sauoureth of Diagredium , because he loatheth it. And it is as impossible to perswade mee to enter league with fancie, which am a mortall foe to affection, and to vowe my seruice to Venus , which am alreadie addicted to Diana . No, no sir, I meane not to loue least I liue by the losse, nor to choose, least my skill beeing small I repent my chaunce. She that is free and willinglye runneth into fetters is a foole, and who so becommeth captiue wtout constraint, may be thought either wilful or witles. It is good by other mens harms to learne to beware,  & to looke before a man doth leap, least in skipping beyond his skill, he light in the myre. Who so considereth the ficklenesse of mens affections, & the fleeting fondnesse of their fading fancie, who carefully looketh at the lyghtnesse of their loue, and marketh the inconstancie of their wauering minde, who readeth the recordes which make mention of their deepe dissemblinges, faithlesse protestations, false vowes, periured promises, fained loue, and forged flatterie: how poore Ariadne was abused, howe Medea was mocked how Dido was deceiued, how Oenone was reiected, and how Phillis was forsaken, and yet would be allured to the traine with such filthie scraps, I woulde count her chaunce too good, were her choice neuer so bad. But leauing these necessarie doubtes, Valericus , I tell you for troth, if I ment to loue, it is not you I meane to lyke, if affection forced me, it is not your person I meane to fancie, your patrimonie is not sufficent to counteruaile my parentage, nor your bringing vp my birth, and therefore I would wish you to sow the seede of your sute in a more fertill soile, for in me you shall finde no grafts of graunt to growe, nor no consent to be cropped, for I neither lyke of your vnlikely loue, nor meane not to bee framed to your fancie. Valericus beeing pushed with this Pike, thought it a signe of small courage to yeelde at the first foine, & therefore looking more narrowly to his ward, and gathering himselfe within his weapon, he stoode to his tackeling with this replie. Madame (quoth hee) if you condempne me of folly for climing a staffe to high, or accuse me of fondnesse for laying my loue on a person of such princely parentage, if I seeme to make an ill market in cheaping such precious chaffer, as the price thereof is farre aboue my reach, yet my offence is too small to beare anie waightie penaunce, sith where the fault proceedeth of loue, there the pardon ensueth of course, but your beautie shall beare all the blame, as the onely spurre of this my rash enterprise. For as it is impossible for the yron to resist the operation of the Adamant, or the sily strawe the vertue of the sucking Ieat, so as impossible it is for a loner to withstande the brunt of beautie, to freeze if he stande by the flame, or to peruert the lawes of Nature. So that madame if you knewe what a breach your beautie hath made into my breast, and howe deepelye I haue shrined the Idoll of your person in my happelesse heart, I assure my selfe though my person and parentage, my birth and bringing vp be farre vnfitte for such a mate, yet you would deeme my loue and loyaltie to deserue no lesse. Loialtie I call it madame, for as all things are not made of one mould, so all men are not of one minde, as the Serpentine pouder is quickly kindled, and quickly out, so the Salamander stone once set on fire canne neuer be quenched, as the soft Waxe is apt to receiue euerie impression, so the hard mettall neuer chaungeth forme without melting. Iason was neuer so trouthlesse as Troilus was trustie, Paris was neuer more fickle then Pyramus was faythfull, Aeneas was neuer so lyght as Leander was faythfull: And sure Madame, I call the Gods to witnesse, I speake without faining, that sith your beautie and vertue eyther by fate or fortune is so deepely shrined in my heart, if it please you to accept me for your slaue or seruaunt, and admitte mee so farre into your fauour, as that I may freely inioy the sight of your sweete face, and feede my fancie in the contemplation of your beautie, in liewe thereof I will repaie such duetifull seruice, as the betrothed fayth of Erasta to his Persida , shall not compare with the loue of Valericus and Castania . pricked forwarde to take some remorse of his tormentes, felte within her minde a carefull conflict betweene fancie and the fates: loue and the destinies, fancie perswaded her to take pittie of his paines, the fates forced her to giue him the repulse, Loue wisht her to retourne his good will with gayne, the destinyes draue her to denie his request, tossed thus with contrarie cogitations, at last she burst forth into these doubtfull speeches. cannot repaie it with loue, because fancie denies me to like: to marie I meane not, to retaine seruaunts I may not. Marie to let thee either to loue, or looke, take this for an aunswere, I neither can nor will. And with that shee went her waie, leauing Valericus greatlye daunted with this doubtfull aunswere, with feare and hope so fiercely assailed, that beeing lefte alone, hee beganne thus to consider of his amorous conceites. If euer wofull creature had cause to complaine his wofull case, then vndoubtedly maye I preace for the formost place, for there is no sorrow more sower, no torment more terrible, no griefe more grieuous, no heauynesse more hurtfull, then to haue desire requited with despight, and good wyll with hate, then to like vppon hope of courtesie, and to finde nothing but hate and hellish crueltie. Alasse poore Valericus , is thy true loue thus triflinglye accounted off, is this the guerdon for thy good wyll? Doeth thy deepe desire merite no better desert, then hast thou no choice, but eyther to dye desperatelye, or else to liue loathsomelye? Why fonde foole, doest thou count her cruell, that at the first giues not a free consent? Doest thou thinke her coye that commeth not at the first call, wouldest thou haue the match made at the first motion? Shee that is wonne with a worde, wyll bee lost with a Winde, the Hawke that bates at euerie cast of the Lure, wyll neuer bee steadfast on the stonde, the woman that frameth her wyll to euerie wishe, will prooue but a wild wanton. No, no, Valericus , let not her denials daunt thee, let not the sower tast of her talke quat thy queasie stomacke, conster all thinges at the best, though her censure was verie seuere, yet shee knitte vppe her talke wyth a courteous close. The hound which at the first default giueth ouer the chase, is called but a curre. The Knight that finding the first encounter combersome, giueth ouer the quest, is counted but a coward, and the louer that at the first deniall is daunted with despaire, is neyther worthie to obtaine his desire, nor inioy his desert. And with that hee floung out of his Chamber, both to auoyde the melancholy which tormented his minde, and see if hee coulde haue a sight of his Goddesse. But Castania altogether vnwilling to parle wyth her newe patient, kept her selfe out of his sight, which Valericus espying, was no whit amazed, but lyke a valiaunt Souldier gaue the fort a fresh assault with a new kinde of batterie, seeking to obtaine that with writing, which he could not gaine with words, and therefore speedely framed a letter to this effect. There is no creature (madame Castania ) so bereaued of reason, or depriued of sence, which beeing oppressed with direfull calamities, findeth not by meere instinct of nature, a present medicine for his maladie, man onelye excepted, who by reason of this want, maye iustlye accuse the iniurious Gods of iniustice. The Tyger though thou shalte tourne the endlesse stone with Sisiphus , and therefore take my naye for an answere. For if I wold I can not, and if I coulde I will not. And so farewell. No waye yours, Castania. seeing with what great disdaine she reiected his dutifull deuotion, and howe with coye countenaunce and lowring lookes she rewarded his loyall loue, hee beganne with reason somewhat to represse his rage, and with wisedome to redresse his witlesse follye, for comparing her crueltie with his owne courtesie, and her wilfull disdaine with his willyng dutye, his disordinate desire beganne not onely to decay, but his extreame loue tourned to extreame hate, in so much that forced with despight, hee sent her in reuenge these raging lynes. because (quoth he) they be women: so if thou aske of me why so rudely I raile agaynst thy recklesse folly, I aunswere, because thou arte Castania , whose mercilesse minde is so misledde with ingratitude, and whose currish nature is foyled with carelesse inconstancie, that lyke Menechmus Supreptus his wife, thou doost not begin to loue, ere agayne thou seekest to hate. Thou playest Castania lyke the young Eagles, which beeing hatched vp by the Birde Osyphaga , neuer seeke to pearke on loftye Mountes, but to sitte in durtye Dales, and lyke the greedie kyte might be by his Page to Castania , who finding her at conuenient leasure, with most reuerent dutie deliuered it. Castania at the first sight coniecturing the contents with scorneful lookes and disdainfull countenaunce vnripped the seales, where seeing and reading his deep deuotion, she perceiued that his affection was no lesse in deede, than hee professed in word, she notwithstanding would take no remorce of his torment, but to dryue him more into dolefull dumpes, she retourned him this dampe. As it is impossible ( Signor Valericus ) to strayne moyst licour out of the drye flint, to procure flaming heat in that which alreadie is nipped with chilling colde, to force the sturdie streames to run against their common course, so as harde it is to winne vnwilling loue, eyther with teares, for trueth. For if thy birth and patrimonie coulde counteruaile my parentage, if my Father were content to knitte vp the knotte, yet neyther his commaunde nor thy intreatie shoulde not make me to choose without my owne loue or liking. Sith then thou arte the man, whome I rather loath than like, cease from thy sute, make a vertue of necessitie, and asswage the flame thy selfe, which no other will quench. By importunate persisting in thy purpose where no hope is, thou proouest thy selfe rather a desperate sotte than a discreete souldiour. To hoppe against the Hill, is extreame fondnesse, to stryue agaynst the streame meere follye, then Valericus auoyde the one and eschew the other: for if thou wilt seeke to gaine my good wil, The Mastiffe Dogge Valericus , can neuer queste lyke a Spaniell, but hee must alwayes barke lyke a Curre, it is naturall for the Pye to chatter, for the Iaye to iangle, and for thee to rayle and rage like a franticke foole. Dooest thou (thinke Valericus ) by brauling like a beggar to become a king, or by thy moodlesse follye to obtaine my fauour, no, as I knowe thy knauerie, so I passe not for thy brauerie: neither can those vaunts stande for payment, where the partie is prickte for a peeuish paltring patch. It is no maruell if thy doggish letters sauoure of Diogenes doctrine, for in troth thou art such a Cinicall kinde of Dunce, that thy fond felicitie is in biting bitterly those, whom otherwise thou canst not reuenge. In deede gentle Balaams Asse, if I had bene so lyght as to haue loued you, I myght iustlye haue bene accused to haue bene a Curre or a Kystrell, for in faith she that feedes her fancie on thy face, maye onely reape this profite to fill her eyes full with the figure of a foole. For my louers Armes Valericus they are imblased in such a coate, as it is harde for thee to controwle. But I know thou boastest yt thou hast gotten thy Antiquitie by conquest, and keepest thy Letters patentes in the beggers bore. Thus adieu Sir Dunce, the more you mislike mee, the better I loue my selfe. Thy detested foe, Castania. with this rigorous reply, but thought himselfe halfe satisfied, that he hadde thus which leaueth the sweete flesh, to praye on the stincking carrion. But why doo I so farre forget my selfe? Is shee to bee blamed that leaueth her choyce to haue a better chaunce, or is the Fawlchon to bee accused of bastardie, that leaueth the Starlyng to praye on the Larke? No: and no doubt such is thy case, for if it be true that all speaketh, or at the least suspecteth, thou art lyke by thy louers Parentage to become a greate Potentate: for if armes bee the bewrayer of auncient discentes, no doubte hee is come of an olde house. Yea, thy Father Orlanio maye reioyce if hee lyue to see the daye that his Daughter shall bee so well wedded as to such a wranglyng Wisarde. But Pasiphae preferred a Bull before a King, and Venus a smeered Smith before Mars the God of Battayle. Tush, Psomneticus was Father to Rhodopes Children, whosoeuer begatte them, and that Cloake is of a course spinning, that cannot keepe off the raine. Farewell. Liuing he hopes to reuenge thy iniuries. Wofull Valericus. minde fried with the flames of furie, and her breast boyled with raging wrath, in such sort, that she coulde not be in quiet nor take any rest, she busied her selfe so carefully in studying with what kinde of reuenge she might best wreake her wrathe vppon him, and requite his spitefull speaches. At last womanlike, she found her tongue the best wepon, and with that she plagued him in this sorte. neuer so deadly wounded tasteth the roote of Tamariske, and is presently cured: The Deare beeing stroken though neuer so deepe, feedeth on the hearbe Dictamum , and forthwith is healed: the Lyon salueth his sicknesse by eating the Sea woolfe, and the Unicorne recouereth his health by swallowing vp the buddes of a Date tree. But man beeing crossed with care, or oppressed wyth griefe, pinched with fancie, or perplexed with Loue, findeth no Hearbe so wholesome, no medicine so milde, no Playster so perfect, nor no Salue so soueraigne, which by their secret vertues can appease his passions. Which madame I knowe by proofe, and nowe speake by experience, for your diuine beautie and secrete vertue, the perfection of your bodie and the bountie of your minde, hath kindled such a flaming fire in my haplesse heart, that by no meanes it maye bee quenched, but will tourne my bodie into dry earth and sinders, vnlesse by the drops of your pittie it be speedelye redressed. Then Madame your beautie is my bale, let it bee my blisse, since it hath wrought my woe, let it worke my weale, and let not my faithfull seruice and loiall loue be recompenced with such rigorous refusalls. Striue not for my lyfe, since you haue my lybertie, seeke not my death, since you are the Saint to whome I offer vp my deuotion. But good madame, let the sweete Balme of your beneuolence salue the sore which so painefully afflicteth my carefull conscience, and with the deaw of your grace redeeme him from most hellish miserie, whose lyfe and death standeth in your aunswere, which I hope shall be such as belongeth to the desert of my loue, and the shewe of your beautie. Yours if he be Don Valericus. kindly toucht her to the quicke, praying the Gods, that sith it was not in his possibilitie to make any sufficient reuenge, they would by some sinister meanes requite hir crueltie. But leauing him to his dumpes, at last to Gwydonius , who besides the beautie of his bodie, and the bountie of his minde (whereat all Alexandria wondred, had by good gouernment and perfect practise, obtained such a dexteritie in all things, as in feates of armes no man more forward, in exercise none more actiue, in playe none more polliticke, in parle none more pleasant, amongst his auncients very wise, amongst the youthfull who more merrie: so that there was no time, person, nor place, whereto he aptly applyed not himselfe: insomuch that he entered into such fauour and familyaritie with Thersandro and Castania , that he was the onely man whose companie they desired to enioye. But especially Castania , who by casting a gazing glaunce some time vpon the beautie of Gwydonius , felte a certayne restraint of libertie in her affections, an alteration of minde, and as it were a ciuill assault within her selfe: but hauing small practise in the pangs of loue, shee could not coniecture the secret cause of these her sodaine passions, thinking that as it was a toye lyghtlye taken, so it would as lightly be left: and vpon this still she rested, conceiuing onely an ordinarie kinde of liking towards Gwydonius . Who bathing thus in the streames of blisse, and safely harboured in the hauen of happinesse, wanting nothing which might content his minde, eyther for plesure or profite, thought it a poynt of meere folly, eyther to seeke or wish for more than inough, knowing that to strayne further than the sleeue would stretch, was but to make the arme bare, and to skippe beyonde a mans skill, was to leape, but not to knowe where to lyght: to auoyde therefore hastinesse in hazarding, hee fell a slumber in the carelesse seate of securite. But as it is impossible for a man to sleepe by the Uiper and not bee inuenomed, to gaze vppon the Cockatrice and not be infected, to stare vppon the Sunne and not bee dazeled, to looke vpon Medusas head and not be transformed, to wade in the waues and not bee drenched, to handle coales and not be scorched, so it was as impossible for young Gwydonius to gaze vppon the beautie of Castania and not bee galled, to fire his eyes vppon her feature and not bee fettered, to see her vertuous qualyties and not bee inueigled: for her courtesie hadde so incountered him, her modestie hadde so amazed him, and her charie chastitie so inchaunted him, that whereas hee came to Orlanio his Courte free from affection, hee was nowe become a seruyle Slaue to Fancie, before a foe to Lust, nowe a friende to Loue: yea, hee felte such an alienation of his senses, and such a straunge Metamorphosis of his minde, as reason was tourned to rage, myrth to mourning, ioye to annoye, delight to despight, weale to woe, blisse to bale: in fine, such contrarye passions so perplexed this doubtfull Patient, as maugre his face, he yeelded the Fort to fancie, and pulde in the former flagge of defiaunce, intreated for truce, and beganne to enter parle with Cupide on this manner. what sollempne motion, naye, what sodayne madnesse, what foolish frensie, or rather what franticke affection hath possessed thee? Is thy lawlesse lybertie tourned to a slauish captiuitie? Is thy freedome fettered? Are thy sences besotted? Is thy witte inueygled? Werte thou of late a defier of Venus , and arte thou nowe a defender of vanitie. Diddest thou of late renounce beautie as a foe, and wilt thou now imbrace her as a friende. Is this the carefull keeping of thy Fathers commaundement, or is this thy diligent duetie in obseruing the counsayle of thy olde Sire Clerophontes ? Hast thou so soone forgotte his fatherlye precepts, or committed to oblyuion his friendlye aduertisement? Did hee carefully warne thee to beware of Loue, and wilt thou carelessely wedde thy selfe to Lust? Did he shewe thee what poysoned bane is hidden vnder the painted baites of beautie, and wilt thou be haled to the hooke? O haplesse case: naye rather, if the charye charge thy Father gaue thee, will be no constraint, if his counsayle will not commaunde thee, if his warning wil not make thee warie, nor his aduice be thy aduertisement: yet let imminent perills, and insuing daungers bee a precious preseruatiue against future calamities. Consider with thy selfe Gwydonius , what difference is betweene freedome and bondage, betweene libertie and captiuitie, mirth and mourning, pleasure and payne, rest and care, happinesse and heauinesse: and so farre dooth he which is free fro affection differ from him which is fettered in fancie. Why but Gwydonius , why doost thou thus recklesly rage against reason? Why doost thou thus fondly exclayme agaynst thine owne welfare? Why doost thou condempne thy selfe of that crime whereof thou art not guyltie. Thy Father warned thee to beware of fickle fancie, but this thy lyking is firme affection. Hys counsayle was to perswade thee from leawde lust, but not from lawfull loue, from vanitie, not from vertue: yea, his will was to wish thee from lykeing such a lewd minion, who had neither birth, welth nor vertue, but a little fading beautie to be either her credite or thy countenance, not to warne thee from louing such a chast maiden, nay a peereles Princesse, whose birth may countenaunce thy calling, whose power may promote thee, whose liuings may inrich thee, whose vertue maye aduaunce thee: yea, in obtaining whome, thou shalt gaine both honour, and perhaps the inheritaunce of a Dukedome. Doost thou thinke then Gwydonius in winning so worthie a peece, to purchase thy Fathers displeasure, nay assure thy selfe he will not onelye be content with thy chaunce, but he will thinke thou hast runne a happier race, than Hyppomanes did in winning Atlanta . Content with thy chaunce? Why Gwydonius art thou so fonde a foole, as to count the Castle conquered, that as yet thou hast not compassed: to suppose the Citie sacked, which thou hast not beseeged: to thinke the bulwarke beaten, which as yet thou hast not battered: or to count the Ladie wonne, whome as yet thou hast not wooed. Nay Gwydonius , if thou weigh thy case in the equall Ballaunce, thou hast more cause of feare than of hope, of doubte than of assuraunce, of myssing thy pretence, than of obtayning thy purpose. The Fawlchon ( Gwydonius seldome perketh with the Merlyne, the Lyon seldome lodgeth with the Mouse, the Hart seldome feedeth with the Pricket, Aquila non capit Muscas , and a Dame indued with Nobilitie, vouchsafeth not to match with a man of meane Gentilitie. Of meane Gentilitie Gwydonius ? yea truely, for Castania rather thinketh thee sprong of some poore peasaunt, than of anye princely personage. Besides, alas Fortune her selfe denieth me anye such fauour, my good will as yet hath deserued no suche gwerdon, my desire is farre aboue my deserts, my ambition aboue my condition, and the poore staye of wandering Gwydonius farre vnfit for the princely state of worthie Castania . But put case she did will as I did, wish that she wer pricked in ye same veine, caught in the same snare, trapped with the like traine, & fired with the like fancie, yet the Duke her father will neither condescend to her mind, nor consent to my motio, neither think well of her liking nor of my loue, nay if he shoulde but once heare of such recklesse folly, as he hath wrought my promotion, so he would worke my confusion, as hee hath bene my friend, so he would be my foe, and in troth Gwydonius not without cause, for art thou so voide of vertue, or vowed to vice, so nursed vp in vanitie, or nusled vp in villanie, as to requite his liberalitie with such disloialtie, to returne the trust which he reposeth in thee with such treason. Tush, Loue is aboue Lord or Lawe, friend or faith. Where Loue leadeth, no master is made account off: no king cared for, no friende forced off, no dutie respected, but all things done according to the qualitie yt is predominant. Why Gwydonius , what doubts are these that thou thus dreamest on? Why dost thou cast beyond the Moone, and feare before thou art in daunger to fall: knowing that Loue and Fortune desireth not them that are dastards, nor careth not for them that are cowardes. The Captaine that retireth from the walls before he hath the repulse, shall neuer returne a conquerour, the Souldier that fainteth before the battaile bee fought, shal neuer vaunt himself of victorie. He that feareth euerie tempest is not fit to be a trauailer. He that doubteth euerie waue shall neuer proue a perfect Pylot, and he that in loue dreadeth euerie chip of mischance, may well encounter, but neuer obtaine the conquest. Sith then Gwydonius , hardie venturing is a signe of happie victorie, sound out the march with the trumpet of trust, beginne the assault, giue the onset. Laie the battering peeces of loue, against the bulwarke of beautye, and no doubt thy successe shall bee such as thou shalt triumph with Caesar and saie, Veni, Vidi, Vici . And art thou so presumptuous fonde foole, as to promise thy selfe the conquest, knowest thou not that the path of loue is perillous. And with that he fell into such melancholike passions, such contrarie cogitations, such doubtfull thoughtes, such fearefull supposes, that as hee which eateth of the Goorde roote looseth his memorye, and as the Elephaunt when hee eateth of the Helitropion leafe, is then verie sleepie, so Gwydonius was so perplexed with these vnacquainted passions, that contrarie to his custome hee hadde driuen mirth into mourning, pleasaunt conceites into painefull cares, laughing into lowring, singing into sorrowe, as beeing thus besotted to solace himselfe, hee went into a Parke adioyning to the Dukes Pallace, where sitting vnder the shade of a beech tree, leaning his head on his hande, he laye as one in a slumber. But Fortune willing somewhat to fauour this young Nouice, brought it so to passe, that Tersandro, Valericus, Castania and Melytta , with diuerse other gentlemen, were for recreation sake, raunging in ye same Parke, who espying ghostly Gwydonius sitting as one in a traunce, Castania passing before the rest, pulling him by the sleeue, draue him thus out of his dumpe. Why how now Gwydonius (quoth shee) are you dreaming or doubting, or is your minde musing vpon some metaphusicall motions, that you sit thus as a man half mortified, your solempne iesture makes me remember the picture of Pigmalion , which once I sawe portrayed out by a skilfull painter, who leaning his head on his Marble mistres, (that so vnfainedly he loued) sate wyth his-eyes as one in a slumber, hauing his face notwythstanding so bedewed with brinish teares, as his outward plaintes did sufficiently bewraie his inward passions. In truth Gwydonius I had taken thee for Pigmalion , if thou hadst hadde teares as thou wert in a traunce, for thou doest not greatly differ from him neither in countenaunce nor colour, wel if it were but a dreame Gwydonius , that thus combred thy conscience, or a doubte that made thee thus dumpish, I wil deuine the one if it be not to darke, or decide the other, if it be not too secrete, marie if the case be combersome, I leaue it to the iudgement of these Gentlemen. seeing before his eyes his gorgeous Goddesse, the verie Saint, at whose shrine he was offering vp scalding sighes, farre fetcht sobbes, plaintes, prayers, and protestations, was so appalde with her presence, that as the Basiliske looseth his sences with the sight of a naked man, as the Torteise seeing the North starre is benummed, as the Henneline looking on the stone Echites is greatly amazed, so Gwydonius seeing the incomperable beautie of his best beloued Castania , was so astonished, yea, so inchaunted with the rare perfection of this heauenly Pallas , that as one besotted he sate sencelesse, not being able to vtter one worde, vntill at length reuiued with the view of her cheerefull countenance, he repaide her with this pleasaunt aunswere. Madame (quoth he) whereas iestingly you saye, that at the first sight you had taken me for perplexed Pigmalion by my pittifull plaintes and carefull countenaunce, but that I wanted trickeling teares to decypher my sorrowe, I aunswere, that woe may verie well bee wythout watrie wailinges, for when the Stone Garatides fryeth wythout, it freezeth within, the Germaunder leafe, when it is most full of moisture, looketh then most drie, where the streame is most deepe, there it is most still, and where is the smallest shewe of teares, there is the greatest signe of sorrowe. And also I call the heauens to witnesse, that when you wakened me out of my dreame by your diuine eloquence, I tooke you either for beautie to be Venus , for comelynesse to be Pallas , or for port and honour to be Iuno , so that both your presence and curtesie daunted my minde, your presence in dazeling my eies so sodainely with so solempne a sight, your curtesie, in that your Ladyship without curiositie would vouchsafe to talke with so meane a Gentleman. But Madame, sith that I perceiue your skill in nauigation to be great, in that you made so cunning a coniecture, and without anie great aiming, so rightly hitte the marke, to put you out of doubt, I confesse I was both in a dreame and a doubt, wherein sith it pleaseth your honour to take so much paine, I will craue your aide to deuine the one, and decide the other. I was walking (Madame Castania ) in my dreame, (as I supposed) solitarily by the sea side, where, as I tooke delight to see the Dolphins leape (which as the Mariners saie is a signe of imminent tempest) I forthwith espyed a rocke in the sea, wherevpon stoode a Ladie araied with roabes of burnisht golde so formed and framed, so adorned and decked with the giftes of Nature, as at the first I tooke her to bee Thetis , that had so gorgeouslye clad her selfe, to welcome home her louer and Lord Neptunus . But viewing her countenaunce more narrowly, I perceiued her to be a mortall creature (though vnworthie such diuine beautie should be shrouded in the substaunce of an earthly carcasse) which so inflamed my affection, so fired my fancie,  & so kindled my desire, that the tormentes of Tantalus , the torture of Ixion , the sorrowe of Sisiphus , were not halfe comperable to the perplexed passions that pinched my haplesse heart, when I sawe all hope cut awaie from inioying this earthly Goddesse, the sea which compassed the rocke was so deepe and daungerous, the cliffes so steep- downe and fearefull, as to descend was no lesse daunger then death it selfe, thus as I surged in griefe, and wandered vp and downe in woe, I spied a bridge a farre off, whereby was a passage to the rocke, which sight so salued my forepassed sorrow, and so reuiued my daunted minde, as I was driuen into an extasie for ioy, to see so good meanes to inioy my wished desire. Comming to the bridge, I found it built of glasse so cunningly, and so curiously, as if Nature her selfe had sought to purchase credit by framing so curious a peece of workmanship. But yet so slenderly, as ye least waight was able to pash it into innumerable peeces, and vnderneath the bridge did run so terrible a sea, such bouncing billowes, such tumbling waues, such fearefull surges, such roaring stremes, such hideous goulfs, as it made the passage seeme a thousand times more perillous. This terrible sight was such a cooling Card to my former conceits, as hope was turned to feare, blisse to bale, & supposed happinesse to assured heauinesse. And yet my fancie was not quenched, but rather far the more inflamed, my desire was not diminished, but augmented, & my liking no lesse, but rather inlarged, so that to liue in loue without hope was loathsome, to seeke redresse was losse of life, to want my wish was horror, to inioy my will was hell, to liue in care without comfort was calamitie, to seeke for cure was more the miserie, not to possesse ye pray was hellish daunger, to venture for the prize was haples death. Thus crossed with cares, & daunted with such diuers doubts, desperate hope so repulsed direfull feare, yt incouraged by ventrous desire, I hadde either obtained my wish, or wanted of my will, if your Ladyshippe had not so sodainely wakened me out of my slumber. Thus madame Castania , you haue heard my dreame, now the doubt is, whether it had ben better to haue ventured vppon the brickle bridge, and so either desperatly to haue ended cares with death, or else valiantly to haue inioyed desire with renowme, or still like a fearefull dastard to haue ended my dayes in lingering loue with myserie. Castania hearing the surmised dreame of Gwydonius , both smelled the fetch, and smiled at the follie of this young youth, knowing that these fantastical visions and presupposed passions, would in time (if he tooke not heed) proue but too true, to preuent therefore such imminent perills, shee nipt her young nouice on the pate with this parle . deuotion, by so much the more desirous attentiuely to heare it, by howe much the more I finde it straunge and wonderfull: yea, so straunge as if I my selfe had not wakened thee out of thy slumber, I would either haue thought it a fained vision, or a fantasticall inuention, but sith these Gentlemen heere present  & mine owne eyes are witnesses, & thine owne tongue a testimonie of thy talke, suffice I beleeue it, though I can not diuine it: to giue a verdit where the euidence is not vnderstood is vanitie, to yeeld a reason of an vnknowen case is meere folly, and to interpret so straunge a dreame without great practise is but to skip beyond my skill, and so lay fast in the mire. Yet least I might seeme to promise much and performe nothing, I will decide your doubt if you please to take my doone for a censure. It is a saying Gwydonius , not so common as true, that the hastie man neuer wantes woe, and that hee which is rash wythout reason, seldome or neuer sleepeth without repentaunce. To venture amiddest the Pikes when perills cannot bee eschewed, is not fortitude but folly, to hazarde in daungers, when death ensueth is not to bee worthely minded, but wilfully mooued. Uertue alwayes consisteth betweene extremities, that as too much fearefulnesse is the signe of a quaking coward, so too much rashnesse betokeneth a desperate Ruffian. Manhoode Gwydonius consisteth in measure and worthynesse, in fearing to hazard without hope. But to giue a verdite by thine owne voyce, I perceiue thou art guiltie of the same crime, for when the bricklenesse of the Bridge portended death, and the surging Seas inferred losse of lyfe, yet desire draue thee to aduenture so desperate a daunger. Better it is Gwydonius to liue in griefe, then to die desperatelye without grace: better to choose a lingering lyfe in miserie, then a speedie death without mercie, better to bee tormented wyth haplesse fancie then with hellish fiends, for in lyfe it is possible to represse calamity, but after death neuer to redresse miserie. Tully Gwydonius in his Tusculans questions, discoursing of the happinesse of life and heauinesse of death, sayth, that to lyue we obtaine it of the louing Gods, but to die, of the vnluckie destinies: meaning heereby, that lyfe though neuer so loathsome, is better then death, though neuer so welcome: whereby I conclude Gwydonius , that to liue carfully, is better then to die desperatly. Gwydonius perceiuing that Castanias parle was nothing to the purpose, and that shee toucht not that point whereof hee desired most to bee absolued, but meant to shake him off wyth a sleeuelesse aunswere, beganne to drawe her to the Trappe wyth this traine. Madame Castania (quoth he) I confesse that rashnesse neuer raigneth without repentaunce, nor hastie hazarding without haplesse harmes, that he which aduentureth desperate daungers is a foole, & he that passeth ineuitable perills is worse then an Asse: Yet from these so generall rules Madame, I exempt these perticular exceptions, namely Loue & Necessitie , which two are tied wtin no bonds, nor limitted within no law, for whom ye diuel driues he must needes run, be the passage neuer so perillous: and whom Loue or Necessitie forceth, he must venture be the daunger neuer so desperate: for as there is no enterprise so easie which to an vnwilling man seemeth not verie hard to bee atchieued, so there is no incounter so combersome where will wisheth, that seemeth not passing easie to bee perfourmed, nowe this will is with nothing sooner pricked forwarde, then either with the force of Loue, or sting of necessitie. So that whosoeuer aduentureth in a daunger, though neuer so desperate, is not to be blamed, if inforced by fancie, or incouraged by affection, and especially where the perill is in possibilytie to bee passed without death, and in the performaunce thereof, the possession of such a prise as the passionate person more esteemeth then lands, limmes, or lyfe it selfe, bee it neuer so sweete. In which case madame my cause consisteth. For the Ladie who was an heauenly obiect to my glasing eies, was so beautified with the giftes of nature, and so perfectly pollished with more then naturall perfection, that with the only view of such diuine beutie, my sences were so besotted, my wit & will so inueigled, my affection so inflamed, & my freedome so fettered, yea, Loue alreadie had made so greate a breach into the bulwarke of my breast, that to obtaine so gorgeous a Goddesse, I thought death no daunger, though neuer so direfull, nor losse of lyfe no torment, though neuer so terrible. In deed Gwydonius quoth Thersandro , I agree with thee in this poynt, that there is no carpet Knight so cowardly that wold not passe most perillous pikes to possesse so liuely a Dame as thou doost decypher, nor no dastard so daunted with dread which would not greatlye indanger himselfe to inioy so louely a damsell, in ye fruition of whom consisteth nothing but ioy, blisse, rest, contentation of minde, delight, happinesse, yea, all earthlye felicitie. And yet Sir (quoth Gwydonius ) your sister Castania condemnes me of follye, in ventring for so precious a price, when as hope perswaded me, that no hazarde could be haples, and assured me that Loue and Fortune fauoureth them that are bold: that the Gods themselues seeing my perplexed passions, would of pittie defend me from those perillous daungers. For if Theseus by Diuine power were ayded against the force of the monstrous Minotaure , or if Iason , who constrained with a couetous desire to obtaine the golden Fleece, arryuing at Colchos , was preserued by the Gods, from the dint of the deadly Dragons, no doubt Iupiter himselfe woulde either haue made the staggering bridge more strong (cosidering that no hope of wealth, no desire of riches, no greedinesse of gaine, no loue of lucre, but beautie her selfe was the victorie I meant to vaunt of,) or els if I hadde sowsed in the roaring Seas, hee woulde haue prouided some happie Dolphin, that Arion lyke, I might arriue at the desired Rocke: and then my daungers should haue bene tourned into delight, my perilles into pleasures, my hazarding into happinesse: yea, I should haue possessed that heauenly paragon, and enioyed the loue of that louelye Venus , whose onelye sight were a sufficient salue, against all fore-passed sorrowes. Staye there Master Gwydonius (quoth the Ladye Melytta ) for I see to graunt one false proposition, is to open a doore to innumerable absurdities, and that by suffering you too long, of these supposed premisses, you wil inferre some cauillyng conclusion to your former reasons: thus I replye. That I confesse necessitie to haue no lawe, but I graunt not the same of Loue: for if it be lawlesse, it is leawde: if without lymittes, lasciuious: if contayned within no boundes, beastlye: if obserued with no order, odious: so that lawlesse Loue without reason, is the verye Load-stone to ruth and ruine. Sith then Master Gwydonius as your selfe affirme, this was the pricke that pusht you into perill, how can the effect be good, when the cause was naught, or howe can you clearkly defend your desperate motion, proceeding of such a fonde and foolish occasion. But it was the perfection of her comelye person, her exquisite feature, and rare beautie, that so kindled thy desire, and so bewitched thy sences: for, who is so fearefull that beautie will not make bolde? who so doubtfull, that beautie wil not make desperate? yea, what so harde that a man will not hazarde, to obtayne so diuine a thyng, as beautie. Oh Gwydonius , hast thou not hearde the Fish Remora lystening to the sounde of a Trumpet is caught of the Fishers, that while the Porcupine standeth staring at the glymmering of the starres, hee is ouer-taken with dogges, that the Deare gazing at the bowe is striken with the bolte, that the Leoparde looking at the Panthers paynted skinne is taken as a praye, and that he which taketh too much delyght to gaze vpon beautie, is oftentimes galled with griefe and miserie. Yea, his pleasure shall inferre such profite, and his good wil such gayne, as if he reapte the beautifull apples of Tantalus , which are no sooner toucht, but they tourne to ashes. Beautie Gwydonius , no sooner flourisheth but it fadeth, and it is not fullye ripe before it beginne to rot: it no sooner blossometh but it withereth, and scarcelye beeing toucht it stayneth, lyke to the Guyacum leafe, that hath the one halfe parched, before the other halfe be perfect: to the Birde Acanthis , which hatched white, yet tourneth blacke at the first storme: or lyke to the Stone Astites , that chaungeth colour with the onelye breath of a man. If then Gwydonius , Beautie be so fading, so fickle, so momentarie, so moouing, so withering, so waning, so soone passed, and so soone parched: is this the Iewell, which you count more deere than life? and the Iemme which you thinke worthie to be purchased with the danger of death? No doubt Gwydonius , if you wonne the victorie, you might vaunt of a great Conquest, and if your long hope were repayed with a great happe, it shoulde bee much lyke to his, which thinking to embrace Iuno , caught nothing but a vanishing clowde. You doo well Madame (quoth Castania ) to put an If, in it, because hee that vaunteth of victorie before hee hath wonne the fielde, maye prooue himselfe a foole: hee that bragges of gaines before the accompts be cast, may perhappes put his winnings in his eyes: and hee that bloweth the Mort before the fall of the Buck, may very well misse of his fees: so he that counts himselfe a speeder before he be a wooer, sheweth himselfe a vaine person or a vaunting patch. Might it not bee I praye you Master Gwydonius , that passing the bridge scaping the dangerous seas, & happely arriuing at the desired Rocke, yet you might misse of your purpose? Yes forsooth: for many a man bendeth his bow, yt neuer killeth his game, laieth ye strap yt neuer catcheth the fowle, pitcheth the Net that neuer getteth the fish, & long time are heauie wooers that neuer proue happie speeders. So perhaps Gwydonius you might be crossed with a chippe of the same mischaunce, and the gorgeous Dame whome you adore for a Goddesse might repaye your liking with loathing, your loue with hate, your good will with despite and your fixed fancie with small affection, either that she lyked you too little, or loued another too much. All these doubts Gwydonius are carefullye to be cast, and wisedome it is to feare the worst, and finde the best: but you Sir like a lustie champion, thinke a Ladie won at the first looke, and the good will of women gained at the first glaunce, thinking the Gods theselues are to be accused of iniustice, if they be not ayders to your enterprise, insomuch that if in ventring ouer the perilous passage, you had by disaster Fortune fallen into the daungerous Seas, you doubted not but that Iupiter would haue sent a Dolphin, that Arion like you might escape the fearefull surges: but Gwydonius bee not so ventrous, least though you harpe very long, you get not the like hap. These premisses considered, if my censure might stand for a sentence, I deeme it better to be counted a dastardly coward, than a desperate caitife, better to forsake your Goddesse, than your God, better to lyue pinched with a few momentarie passions, than with desperate death to destroy both soule and body: for there is no sore such which in time may not be salued, no care such which cannot bee cured, no fire so greate which may not bee quenched, no loue, liking, fancie, or affection, which in time may not either be repressed, or redressed. Valericus hearing this rough replye of Castania , supposed that although she leuelled at Gwydonius , yet shee shot at him, and fearing the fort should be too much shaken with this fearce assault, he stifly defended the walles with this fresh Alarum. Madam quoth hee, I se you will sit nye the wals eare you be thrust out for a wrangler, and that you will speake against your owne conscience, but you will haue the conquest: for my owne part Madame, howsoeuer I seeme to lyke it, I will not saye I mislike it, but I am sorrie you Madame Melitta shoulde so blasphemouslye imblaze the Armes of beautie, and so recklesselye rayle against the sacred lawes of loue: take heede for crossing Cupid so crabbedlye, for though he forgiue and forget, Venus is a woman, and will seeke reuenge. Valericus (quoth she) take no care what daunger I incurre for speaking the truth, if I chaunce to bee harmed, it is mine owne mishap, and for Venus reuenge I care for it the lesse because I feare it not: if I speake against my selfe, you may see I am the fitter to bee a Iudge, because I am not partiall, nor haue any respect of persons. These quippes Madame (quoth Gwydonius ) are nothing to the purpose, therefore in the behalfe of my selfe and beautie thus I answere. That as there is nothing that so soone procureth a man to loath as deformitie, so there is nothing which sooner perswadeth a man to loue than beautie, for the most precious stone is chosen by the most glystering hiew, the purest golde by the most perfect colour, the best fruite by the brauest blossomes, and the best conditions by the sweetest countenaunce, so that where beautie raineth, there vertue remaineth, and vnder a faire face resteth a faithfull heart. Sith then beautie and bountie cannot be parted, what man is hee so brutish, whom the least of these will not make to break or bende? And wheras you condemn me of vanitie for vaunting before the victorie, I say, that if fortune had so fauored mee, that I had gayned the presence of my Goddesse, I would neuer haue doubted to haue obtained my desire: for if she had seene the desperate daunger which I aduetured, and the fearefull perilles which I passed for her sake, she coulde not but of conscience, repaye my loue with vnfayned loyaltie, and my good will with treble gaine. And in troth I thinke it vnpossible, that such heauenlye beautie shoulde bee eclypsed with crueltye, and such perfect comelynesse be blemesht with curious coynesse. Why Gwydonius (quoth she) doost thou call it crueltie, not to condiscende to the request of euerie one that wooeth, or doost thou tearme it coynesse not to yeelde to the assaulte of euerye flattering Louer, then in my iudgement it were good for euerye woman to bee both cruell and coye, that by crueltie she might auoyde the traine of trothlesse wooers, and by coynesse eschewe the troupe of faithlesse suters. And so Madame (quoth Valericus ) she should reape small comfort and lesse credit. Tush Signor Valericus (quoth Gwydonius ) it pleaseth her thus merelye to iest, whereas I knowe shee dooth accompt more of a courteous Dame, than of a curyous Damsell, and that her Ladishippe so detesteth the name of crueltye, that shee woulde bee loath to bee thought to haue a mynde deuoyde of mercie. And in troth to leaue these particular instaunces, women in generall, or for the most parte, are bountifull, courteous, sober, chaste, demure, not imbrued with vice, but indued with vertue: so that by howe much womens bodies are weaker than mens, by so much their mindes are more strong and vertuous. What Gwydonius (quoth she) doo you thinke to bee a free-man in Wales , for offering a leeke to Saint Dauie , or to bring Pan into a fooles Paradise, by praysing his Pipe. Not so Madame (quoth he) but I hope in extollyng a Souldiours life to haue Saint George to my friend, and in giuing verdit with Venus to gaine her good wil, and to reape the reward that Paris had for his censure. Marte sir (quoth Castania ) if you haue no better gettings, you may gaine long inough, and yet liue by the losse: for in obtaining one friend, you shall reape two foes as Paris did, who was more plagued by Pallas and Iuno , than pleasured by flattering Venus . And yet Madam (qd he) his mishap shall not make me to beware: for if Venus wold grant me but one Lady in the world, whom most entirely I loue, I would neither respect Pallas, Iuno , nor Diana her selfe, were she neuer so despitefull. Yes but you wold (quoth she) if she pinched you but with Acteons plague, to pester your heade with as many hornes as a Hart. It wold cause you coniecture your new Mistresse were too much giuen to the game, or that thou wert come from Cornetto by discent. Tush Madame (quoth he) doo you count Acteons hap such a great harme, the only sight in seeing Diana naked, was a recompense for all his ensuing sorrowes, and if my selfe might inioye my wish, and obtaine the heuenly Dame that so hartely I desire, the plague of Acteon , nay ye griping griefs, ye ghostly spirits do suffer, shuld not counteruaile the ioye I shoulde conceiue in inioying so peerelesse a Iewell. Truly (quoth Thersandro ) thou art worthie Gwydonius to be a chapman, that thou bids so well for thy chaffer, and in my minde she is not in Alexandria , who for her beautie is so to be loued, or at ye least wold deeme thee not worthy to be liked. But leuing these amorous discourses, let vs hye vs in hast to the Court, least in tarrying Orlanio misse vs, and so we be shent. The companie obaying the minde of Thersandro , passed as speedely as might be to the Pallaice, where being arriued, they departed euery man to his owne lodging. Castania had no sooner conueyed her selfe closely into her chamber, but her minde was moued with a thousand sundry motions, and she felt such a cruell conflict in her haplesse hart, by the assault of diuers contrarie passions, that how stoutly so euer she defended the walles, she found her force too weak to resist the rage of so recklesse a tyrant. Now the prayers Valericus powred forth came to effect, now Venus meant to be reuenged for the crueltie she vsed to her valiant Captain Valericus , who so valiantly had fought vnder the flagge of affection, and yet could by no meanes preuayle. For Castania hearing the sugured Eloquence, which so sweetlye flowed from the sappie wit of Gwydonius , framing in her fancie the forme of his face, and printing in her heart the perfection of his person, was so intangled in the snares of Loue, as shee coulde by no reason redresse her miserie, but will shee, nyll shee, fell into these bitter complaints. Alas witlesse wretch (quoth she) that I am, what fierie flames of fancie doo frie within mee? what desire, what lust, what hope, what trust, what care, what dispaire, what feare, what furie? that to be payned wyth these perplexed passions, to me that neuer felt the force of them before, is no lesse dolour than death it selfe, bee it neuer so dyrefull. O Gods, where are nowe become those loftye lookes I vsed to Valericus ? Where is the disdaynefull dealynges, the coye countenaunces, the curyous congies, the causelesse crueltie? Yea, the harde heart, which so rigorouslye reiected the loue of him which so entirely liked me. Could I, fonde foole that I am, valiauntly withstande the assaults of a worthie Gentleman, & shall I cowardly yeeld to an vnknowen strauger: did I loath him whose parentage was little inferiour to mine, and shall I loue another of base and vild birth: did I disdaine to looke at the lure, and shall I now stoope without stall, come without call: yea, and to such an emptie fist, O lawlesse Loue, O witlesse will, O fancie, fraught full of phrensie and furie. Alasse, if I should be so carelesse as to consent to this franticke toie, what will they say, that praised me for my vertue? will they not as fast dispraise me for my vanitie, wil not my father fret, my kinsfolke crie out, my friendes be sorrie, my foes and especially Valericus , laugh me to scorne, and triumph of this my mishap: yea, wil not all ye world wonder to see me alate giuen to chastitie, and now shake hands with virginitie, to yeeld my deerest iewell & chiefest treasure into ye hands of a stragling straunger, who came to my fathers court without countenance or coine, wealth or worshippe, credit or calling: yea, who by his owne report is but a person of small parentage. Seeke then Castania to asswage this flame, and to quench this fire, which as it commeth wtout cause, so it wil consume without reason. For the greatest flowe hath the soonest ebbe, the sorest tempest hath the most sodaine calme, the hottest loue hath the coldest end, and of the deepest desire oft times ensueth the deadlyest hate: so that she which settles her affection wt such speed as she makes her choice without discreation, may cast her corne she knowes not where, and reapes she wots not what, and for her hastie choosing, may perhaps get a heauie bargaine. Alasse, I knowe this counsaile is good, but what then? can I denie that which the destinies haue decreede, is it in my power to peruert that which the Planets haue placed? can I resist that which is stirred vp by the starres? No, what neede I then make this exclamation, sith I am not the first nor shall not be the last whom the frantike phrensie of flickering fancie, hath with more wrong and greater vauntage piteously oppressed. What though Gwydonius be not wealthie, yet he is wise, though he be not of great parentage, yet he is of comelye personage, it is not his coine that hath conquered me, but his countenaunce, not his vading riches, but his renowmed vertues, & I far more esteeme a man then money: I but the Duke my father is not so base minded as to bestow me vpo so meane a Gentleman, he neuer will consent that poore Gwydonius shuld inioy yt which he hopeth some pearlesse prince shall possesse. What then? shall I preferre my Fathers weale before mine own wil, his liking before mine own loue? no, no, I will choose for my selfe whatsoeuer my choice be. Why but perchance Gwydonius will no more esteeme thee then thou didst Valericus , & repay thee with as smal fancy as thou him with affection. Tush, doubt it not Castania , thou art ye dame which he so deciphered in his dreme, thou art ye Venus which he saw in his visio, yu art ye goddesse, whose beauty hath so bewitched him, yu art ye iewell to possesse, yt which ther is no hap to hard which he would not hazard, no daunger so desperate which hee wold not aduenture, no burden so heuie which he wold not beare, nor no perill so huge which he wold not passe. And shall not then Gwydonius be my seruant, sith I am his Saint, shall not I like him which loueth mee, sith he is my ioy, shall I not inioye him? Yes, Gwydonius is mine, and shall bee mine in despight of the fates and Fortune. Castania hauing thus pittifully powred out her plaints would gladly haue giuen Gwydonius intelligence (with modestie if she might) of her good will towardes him, & god knows how faine Gwydonius wold haue discouered his feruent affection, if too much feare had not astonished him, & too great bashfulnes staied her. She therfore houering betweene feare & hope, perseuered so long in his pensiue passions & careful cogitations, yt by couert concealing of her inward sorrow, the flame so furiously fried within her, that she was constrained to keepe her bed. Whervpon Melytta coniecturing the cause of her care by ye colour of her countenaunce, thought to sift out the occasion of her sorrow, yt by this meanes she might apply a medicine to her maladie, & finding fit opportunitie, she brake with her in this wise. Madame Castania (quoth shee) since I haue by ye Duke your father bene assigned to you as a companion, I haue in such louing wise both comforted & counselled you, as I hope you haue iust cause to say yt I haue most carefully tendred your estate, for perceiuing how willing you were to follow my direction, I counted your wealth my weale, your pleasure my profite, your happinesse my ioy, & your prosperitie my felicitie. Which friendly care if it wer not to be considered, if I shuld shew you what great sorrow I sustaine by your heauinesse, you would iudge my words to proceede either of folly or flatterie, but if your sore be such as it may be salued, if your care may be cured, if your grief may be redressed, or your malady mitigated by my means, comand me good Castania in what I may to pleasure thee, & thou shalt find me so charely to performe my charge, as my willing mind shall euidetly bewray my well meaning. I see Castania , of late, such a straunge Metamorphosis in thy minde, as for pleasant conceits thou dost vse pensiue cogitations, thy cheerefull countenance is changed into lowring lookes, thy merrie deuises into mournful dumps, & yet I cannot coniecture no cause of this sodaine alteration. If want of riches should worke thy woe, why thou swimst in wealth, if losse of friends? thou hast infinit of noble paretage, which loues thee most entirely. If thou meanest no longer to leade a single life, no doubt thy father will prouide thee of such a princely match, as shall content thee for his person, and countenaunce thee with his parentage. But if in all these supposes I haue mist the marke, and haue not toucht the case of thy calamitie, vnfolde vnto me Castania what the paine is that thus doth pinch thee, and assure thy selfe, I will be so secrete in thy affaires, as euer Lampana was to her Ladie Cleophila . Castania hearing this friendly discourse of Melytta , thought for al this faire glose ye text might be to intricate, & that these painted speeches would proue but rotten pillers, fearing therefore the fetch, and doubting the worst, if shee bewraie her minde, shee framed her this aunswere. Madame (quoth she) the incomperable curtesie and vnfained friendship which since your first comming I haue found in you by experience, will neither suffer mee to suspect your Ladyshippe of flatterie, nor my selfe willingly to be accused of ingratitude, for your diligence hath bene so great, & my deserts so small, that if I might but liue to requite some parte of your good will, it were the second felicitie I looke for in this life. But touching the pensiue passions which thus diuersly perplexed mee, I aunswere, that as he which is wounded of the Bores tuske, if his sore take aire is verie hardly healed, as hee which stroken with a Scorpion if his wound take wind can neuer be cured: so madame, many inward maladies carry this nature, that if they be once discouered they are far the more hardly recouered, that it is better to conceale them with griefe, then reueale them in hope of releefe. Not so Castania , your principle is not true, for if your passions proceeded of loue, which of all other inward sores requireth greatest secrecie, yet vndoubtedly ye more it is discouered, the sooner it is cured, for as the stoke of Armenia beeing couered with sande, burneth most extreamly, and no sooner taketh aire but it cooleth, so the firie flames of loue raked vp in silence, frie most furiously, but beeing by discourse disclosed, they soone conuert from flame to fume and smoke. Wherfore good Castania impart vnto me the matter which doeth import thee so neere, and I sweare vnto thee by the sacred rites of Caeres , which is so honoured in Alexandria , that if thou doost loue where thy friends do not like and thy wish be contrarie to their will, yet I will seeke all meanes possible to redresse thy sorrowe. Alasse good madame, rather then you shoulde thinke mee so incredulous or suspitious, as not to beleeue your oth, or doubt of your secret dealing, I will without delay make you priuie to the cause of my paine, what perill so euer I incurre by reuealing it. So it is Melytta , that the perfection of Gwydonius , his exquisite qualities, and excellent vertues haue fiercely assaulted the sort of my fancie, as I am perforce constrained to resigne my libertie captiue vnto his curtesie, and to make his person the prison of my heart. This lucklesse and vnlikely loue madame, is the cause of my care, & the sum of my sorrowe, this frantike affection hath driuen my drouping heart to shew forth these drousy looks, this is it which hath made me an enimie to my selfe, a foe to all good companie, & to delight in nothing but sorrow & solitarinesse: yea, this is the sore, which if in time it be not salued, will preuent by death all other miseries. And is this (quoth Melytta ) the paine that so greatly perplexeth you, is this the care which so cobers thy conscience? is this the daunger which driues thee into such deepe distresse? Doest thou thinke so superstitiously of Gwydonius , or so abiectly of thy selfe, yt thou deemest this matter impossible to be brought to passe: no, no, doubte not Castania , I my self dare absolutely promise thee, that thy loue shall sort to such happie successe, as thou thy self doest seeke for. And with that Melytta staied by a sodaine sight shee had of ye Saint that Castania so hartely serued, for Gwydonius was entering in at the chamber doore with a dish of delicates, which Orlanio hearing his Daughter was sicke, had sent her. Melytta seeing yt Cupid began to fauor the cause of his clients, in giuing them such fit opportunitie to discouer their cares wet her way, leauing Gwydonius ye first man to play his part in this tragicall Comedie, who seeing his goddesse thus surprised with sicknesse, was so galled with griefe, so pinched with hellish passions, & so tortured with extreame torments, yt his colour began to change, & he fetcht a deep sigh or two, which Castania hearing, she perceiued wtout touching his pulses, the cause of these his sodain passions. In fine, such melancholike motions so amazed his minde, that he was almost mute in his message, yet at length incouraging himselfe, he presented it vnto her in this wise. Madame (quoth he) the Duke your Father hearing of your sodain sicknesse, in token of his fatherly affection, amongst all his dainties, hath sent you this dish, which he thinks most meete for your diet, wishing your Ladyship to let no doubtfull motions distresse your minde, nor no carefull thoughtes cumber your conscience, for you shall lacke nothing if you reueale to him your want, which either your will or wish can desire. And truely madame, to manifest my willing duetie (if the prayers of a poore Gentleman may be heard of the heauenly Gods) I wish that before you tast of this foode, it may turne to Nectar , whereby not onely your sicknesse should be salued, but your diuine beautie and vertue according to desert shuld be crowned with immortalitie. Castania perceiuing with what feruent affection Gwydonius vttered these wordes, began to cheere vp her selfe, in hope yt her good will should not be repaied with ingratitude, taking therfore the present at his hands, and liking it neuer the worse for his sake that brought it, she returned him this replie. Gwydonius (quoth she) as I haue cause most reuerently to accept of my fathers louing curtesie, & to repay his natural affection with most dutiful obedience, so I haue cause to thanke thee for thy paines, and to thinke wel of thee for thy wish, promising in recompence of thy good will, if in any respect I may plesure thee, to seeke and sue to my father for preferment. Madame, I account the performance of my message no paine, but pleasure, and I think my selfe as much honoured by this office, & thrice more happie the if I shuld in Ganimedes place present the cup to Iupiter . But Madame, sith that to stop the streame, is to make the floud flow more fiercely, to represse the fire, is to make it flame more furiously, and to restraine the force of loue, is to kindle a greater flame, least too long delaie shoulde breede too great daunger, and by concealing my sorrow I shuld make the sore incurable, I thought good either presently to heare the curteous sentence of my lyfe, or the cruell doome of my death. So it is Madame, that too long gasing vpon the beames of your heauenly beautie, & to narrowlye construing ouer your vertuous conditions, I remaine so caught in the snare of your bounty, & so thralled in the thridde of your vertue, that the staie of my life hangeth in your hands, either to driue me downe to hellish miserie, or to hoist me vp to heauenly felicitye. For although I haue not heeretofore by duetifull seruice made manifest the loyaltie of my loue, yet since I first framed in my fancie (as in a mirrour) the shape of your surpassing beautie, my heart hath bene crossed with such cruell Camizados for your sake, as if with the Target of hope, I had not withstoode the furious force of such raging furies, I had by dispaire bene dashed against most dangerous rocks. Sith the Madam ye sight of your sweet face hath fast fettered my fancie in the linkes of loue, as without your meanes I can neither bee redressed nor released: I humbly desire you neither to resist the motion of my wel meaning, nor to reiect the deuotion of my good will, but to accept your poore Gwydonius as a faithfull seruant. Castania hearing diligently the faithfull discourse of distressed Gwydonius , perceiuing by his sighes the pinching sorow of his thoughts, and seeing him to fast fettered in folly, on a sodaine to giue her the slip, had that she desired, and now her louing lookes was tourned to lowring glances, her delightfull curtesie, to disdainfull coynesse, & she thought to repaie the sweet meate wherewith before she fed him, with most sowre sauce, not that she misliked of his loue, for it was the onely thing she desired, but to make him the more feruent in affection, vttering these or such like words to her selfe secretly. And is not Castania the victory most accounted of, wher the conquest is most doubtful? is not the castle which abideth the longest battery thought the richest bootie, are not those pearles which are scarcely found & hardly gotten, euer of the greatest value, what so is gained by perill, is thought alwaies precious, hardly come by, warily kept. The Maide that by long sute and much trauaile is obtained, by how much the more she was hard in the winning, by so much the more she will be sweet in the wearing, she which in her virginitie is charie of her chastititie, in her marriage wil be as warie of her honestie, therfore I will qualifie ye hot loue of Gwydonius with a cold potion, & with that she made him this waspish answere. Why Gwydonius , shal the olde Prouerbe be verified in thee, that the Priest forgets himselfe that euer he was a Clearke, that too much familiaritie breedes contempt. I see well if Appelles that cunning Painter suffer the greasie Sowter to take a view of his curious worke he will grow so malapert, as to meddle with his picture: if the proud Centaure Ixion be bidden to the Feast of the Gods, no lesse then Iudo her selfe wil suffice him for his choyce. Set a beggar on horse-backe they saye, and he wyll neuer alyght. Extoll one of base stocke to any degree of dignitie, and who so proud and haughtie. I speake this Gwydonius to thy reproofe: is thy stomacke alate waren so queasie, that no diet will downe but my Fathers owne dish? will no meanor mate suffice thee, vnles thou match with a Prince? is there no Ladie will like thee, but my loue? is there no courser Dame to couet, vnlesse thou courte vnto me? Did my Father promote thee to this thou art from the state of a begger, and wilte thou now presume to be my better? Haue my lookes bene so louing, my countenaunce so courteous, my glaunces so full of good will, as to promise so much as thou dost presume? No: but one only countenance in a seruile mind is too much incouragement. Doost thou thinke Gwydonius , that I accompt so meanelye of my person, as to match with a man of thy pitch: Shal I so [illeg.]cracke my credite, as to cumber my selfe with one of the callyng? Shall I so stayne my state, as to stoope to thy lure? No: where is thy coyne to maintaine my countenaunce? Where is thy wealth to vphold my worship? Where is thy patrimonie to conteruayle my personage? But put case I accepted of thy fate, dost thou thinke euer to gaine my fathers good will? doost thou thinke it is possible to compasse his consent? doost thou hope euer to take him in such a vaine as he will be willyng to giue his verdit on thy side. No Gwydonius , but if he were priuie to this thy presumption, he would repaye thy follye with too much furie, he would vnplume thee of all his feathers, that like Aesops Crowe thou mightst receiue the reward of thy rashnesse. If therfore thou loue thine owne welfare keepe thy selfe within thy boundes, and striue not farther than thy sleeue will stretch, least in climing too high, thou catch the sorer fall. Castania hauing thus sharply shaken vp my young youth Gwydonius , thought she had giuen him a sufficient cooling Carde: but he no whit dismayed with thys denial, like a lustie champion entred pece mele with her in this wise. Madame (quoth he) the poore shoomaker was not blamed for viewing Appelles picture, but because in finding fault he went beyond his shooe: the Centaure Ixion was not reprooued for his familiaritie with Iuno as he was a guest, but in that his sute tended to the sackeing of her honestie: familiaritie neuer breedes contempt in a good mind, neither am I to be accused of ye crime, for the most seruile slaue in Alexandria (I call the heauens as witnesses of my wordes) dooth not with more louing duetie reuerence and honour your person and parentage, then doth your poore seruaunt Gwydonius . Well Madam though my nature and nurture be such in your sight, as they bewray my bringing vp and birth to bee so base, as if I meane to draw my discent, I must (as you say) imblaze mine armes in the beggars coate, yet thus much I aunswere in respect of my parents and without arrogancie thus farre I stande on my pantuffles, that the credit I haue in your Fathers Court, is not coequal with the calling I haue in my owne countrey, if I did not count it more great credite and honour, in that I haue sometime inioyed a curteous countenance of your sweete selfe, since my comming. But if I were the most famous Prince in the world, I so esteeme your deuine beautie and exquisite vertue, as I would thinke my self farre vnworthy to possesse such heauenlye perfection: which if I could obtaine, the displeasure of your Father could no whit discourage mee, his thundring threates could no whit amaze me: no, death it selfe could neuer daunt my minde, were it neuer so despitefull. But who (say you) can lay their loue wher is no desert, and wher want breeds a flat deniall? Ah Castania , Nature by her secret motion, hath indued all creatures with some perfect qualities, to supplye that want which breedes misliking. The Moule depriued of sight hath a wonderfull hearing, the Hare being very fearefull is most swifte, the fish hauing no eares, hath most cleere eyes: so though want of dignitie disgrace me, though want of coyne discountenaunce me, though lacke of wealth impaires my credite, yet Nature hath giuen me such a loyall and louing heart, as I hope in the perfection of that, she hath supplyed the want of all the rest: so that Madame though I want coyne I do not want constancie, though I haue no lands, yet I lack not loyaltie, though I want wealth, yet I want not wil to ende my life to doo you good, or spend my time to doo you seruice. whether she should presentlye consent to his demaund, or still driue him off with delayes, whether she shuld yeelde the fort at the first skirmish, or stand to the doubtful euent of battaile: at length least she shuld digresse from the course of womankinde, she thought best to denie that she most of all desired, and therefore then gaue him this aunswere. what you are by discent I knowe not, nor I care not, and if I did, it auayleth not, but this I saye, that it is harde taking of Fowle, when the net is discryed, and ill catching of Fish, when the hooke is bare: impossible it is Gwydonius to inferre beleefe, where no credite will be giuen, and to deceyue her that spieth thy fetch: when the string is broken, it is hard to hit the white, and when a mans creditte is called in question, perswasions can little preuaile. It is a religion amongst louers to sweare and forsweare, to promise mountaines and perfourme moulhilles, to bee ripe without and rotten within, to carrie a rustie blade in a veluet scabberde, and a siluer Bell with a leaden clapper. Therefore Gwydonius I had rather mistrust too soone, than mislyke too late, I had rather feare my choice than rue my chaunce, I had rather stop at the brimme, than at the bottome: for the signet being set, it is too late to breake the bargaine, and fancie being once fixt, it is too late to reclayme affection. For the loue of a woman is lyke the Oyle of Flynt, which being once congealed will neuer be dissolued, like the Diamonde, which being once rubbed with the gum of a Pine tree, will neuer be broken: so if I fancie any, sith I meane not to fleete, it shall bee such a one, as I neede not repent me. And whereas you say Gwydonius , that in despight of Fortune, Nature hath giuen you a louing heart, I my selfe surely did neuer deeme any lesse, but thought you of the crue of those louers that loue too much, hauing as manie Ladies as they haue wits, and that is not a fewe, who count that euery face must haue a new fancie, and if they see a thousand then must be all viewed with a sigh, which considered Gwydonius , I meane not to like nor to loue neither you nor any other. And shall then Madame (quoth he) my merite be repayed with no meede, shall my good will be requited with no gain? shal I haue in lieu of my loue no liking? will you so swarne from Iustice, as not to giue euerye one according to his desert? at the least recompence: not desire with despight, and heartie loue with loathing hate, for as the Poet sayeth. Quis emni succenset amanti . Well Gwydonius , as I will not be thy priuie friend, so I will not be thine open foe, and as I cannot be so curteous as to requight thee for thy paines, so I wil not bee so cruell as to despight thee for thy presumption, and whereas thou crauest gaines for thy good will, I am content to remaine thy vnwilling debter. Yet Madame (quoth he) where the debt is confest, ther remaineth some hope of recouerie, for though ye creditor be neuer so vnwilling to pay the debt being due, hee shall by constraint of lawe and his owne confession, (maugre his face) be forced to make restitution. Truth Gwydonius (quoth she) if he commence his action in a right case, & the plea he puts in, proue not imperfect. But yet take this by the way, it is hard for that plaintiffe to recouer his costs, where the defendant beeing Iudge sets downe the sentence. Gwydonius feeling himselfe pincht to the quick with this pretie quip made no further reply, but lest his long tarying might breed suspition, wishing his Mistres welfare, tooke his leaue very solempnly and sorrowfully, of Castania , who seeing him gone and her selfe alone, began thus to muse and meditate vppon the sharpe aunsweres she had giuen her best beloued Gwydonius . Why Castania , what franticke follye hath made thee thus far to forget thy self. Is the bird inticed to the strappe by the shew of the nettes, is the Foxe allured to the traine by the viewe of the trappe, will the Mouse march under that Ensigne, where the Cat proclaymeth her selfe Captaine? will the silly Doue lay her egges in the Fawlchons neast? or is it the meanes to haue him to thy friend, whome with bitter blowes thou doost rebuke: is there no other call for courtesie but crueltie? doost thou finde no fitter meanes to obtain a reasonable request but by a rigorous repulse? or is it the nature of women to defie that outwardly which they most desire inwardly, to loath that in their mouth, which they loue in their minde, to reiecte that with their hande, which they most willingly would receiue in their heart? Doost thou thinke Castania to drawe Gwydonius to thy desire, by detesting him? Doost thou thinke to allure him to thy loue, by loathing him? Doost thou suppose to winne him to thy will by these waspish aunsweres? No: and what, doost thou know what perill will insue of this repulse, what daunger will followe of this denyall? Is it lyke hee will put it vp patiently? No sure, either looke to haue his extreame loue tourned to extreme hate, or that he will persist no longer in the pursute of his purpose. Oh would to God Gwydonius , thou wert againe to begin thy demaund, and I to frame mine aunswere: then would I salue thy sores with sweet strops, not with cutting corasiues: then wold I mittigate thy maladie with easie medicines, not with pinching playsters: then wold I comfort thee with consent, not daunt thee with denyalls. But alas, had I wist now comes too late, & therefore Castania if thou hast made a fault, seeke to make amends, and recompence this his iniurie with most friedly courtesie. And with that came Melitta , who comforting Castania , passed away the rest of the day in parle . But Gwydonius , who all this while had a flea in his eare, was driuen into a quandarie with the taunting quips of his Mistresse, fearing that although his accompts were great, his gaines should be little, & though he made a very long haruest, yet he shoulde reape but a very small croppe, thinking that vnder such sower speeches, a sugred minde could not be contained: yet at last entring into deeper consideration with himselfe, he fell into these tearmes. But by the sweete (quoth he) how should we know the sower: but by the blacke how should we know the white: he neuer greatly accompteth of prosperitie which hath not bene before pinched with aduersitie: which perchaunce Castania meanes to make me trye by experyence, thinking to feede me first with bitter broaths, that her after daintie fare may more delight me: to daunt me with the raging stormes of deniall, that the calme of her consent may more content me: to make mee tast the bitter pills of annoy, that heerafter I may enioy the greater ioy: for the chilling cold of Winter makes the sprowting spring time seeme farre more pleasaunt, the parching heate of Summer, makes the coole shade more delightfull, and the frowning lookes of Castania , will make her smiling countenaunce seeme more cheerefull. Then cease not Gwydonius to pursue thy sute with endlesse paine, either to enioy her curtesie, or tast of her crueltie, to thy great happinesse or extreme heauinesse. misfortune, neuer feared to giue the assault for all the first repulse, but onely sought opportunitie how he might in close combat once again incounter with Castania , vowing either to return wt some signe of victorie, or els to put him and life in hazard. But fortune meaning plesantly to sport wt this youg nouice, wold neuer minister such fit occasio, yt he might haue solitary accesse to his goddes, for Castania of preteded purpose so warely auoided his companie, and with such disdainfull lookes so reiected his dutie, as Gwydonius was constrained to seeke his course, by a new compasse, delyuering vnto one of her maides a friendly letter to this effect. Who so tasteth (Madame Castania ) of the Riuer Licos in India , feeleth such a continuall flame to fry and fret his intrayles, as it is more torture than to bee tormented with the hellish-furies, and this griefe canne neuer be redressed, but with drinking the bloud of his deerest friend. And as he that is venomed by the Phalanga , feeleth such painfull passions, as he runneth mad, and is onely cured by the meanes of most harmonious musicke: so Madame, the furious heate of fancie, dooth so scorch and scale my haplesse heart, and dooth perplexe me with such hellish pangues, as death it selfe were thrice more desired, than thus to driue my dayes in dolour. And I haue so greedely swallowed vp the sugred poyson of your deuine beautie, as through the extremitie of pinching griefe, which so direfully distresseth me, I rest as one distract from his senses, not possible to obtaine a cure for this my calamitie, vnles with the deaw of mutuall affection you mitigate my maladie, or with the pleasant harmonie of your musical consent, you appease my miserie. Sith then Madam my care proceedeth from your beautie, let my sore be cured by your bountie, sith the perfection of your person hath wrought my bane, let the effect of your courtesie procure my blisse, and reiect him not so rigorously, which respecteth you so reuerently. Loath him not so hatefully, which loueth you so heartely: nor repaie not his dutifull amitie, with such deadly enmity. The pike fatally prosecuteth the fish Mugra , as his mortall foe, and yet seeing him snared on the fishers hooke, he speedely shreddeth the line in sunder, to deliuer him, the Snake most deadly detesteth the field- mouse, and yet she heapeth vp in her hole store of prouision to preuent her enimies penurie: and shall then madame, your crueltie so farre exceede these sencelesse creatures? shall your rigour be so voide of reason, as to requite your friende with paine? when they repaie their foes with pleasure, to driue your friends into distresse, when they redeeme their foes from daunger, no madame, I hope you wil not counteruaile my constancie with such discurtesie, nor so recklesly regard your poore Gwydonius , whose loue and loyaltie is so great, that as the stones which are found in the riuer Lyncestis , the lowder the winde bloweth, & the deeper they are drencht in the water, the more they burne and blaze: so the more you seeke to coole my fancie with disdaine, the more my affection is kindled with desire, the more you loath, the more I like: the greater dispaire you driue me into by denialls, the greater hope, (incouraged by constancie) I haue to obtaine my request, in which feruent affection, I meane to remayne without chaunge, crauing in liewe of this my loyaltie, that you will speedely send the messenger of present consolation, to him which pineth awaie, and is yours onely, and euer. Still in hope, Gwydonius. although she perceiued by the contents that his loue was not counterfait, but constant: not lyght, but loyall: not floting, but faithfull: and that she should not finde him immutable in prosperitie, which was so permanent in aduersitie. Yet (whether it were for coynesse in consent, or charinesse of choise I knowe not) she once againe thought to sound him more deeper, to keepe out still the flagge of defiaunce, and to spende one Uollee of shot in the face of her enimie, to see if a hot skirmish would make him flie the field. And if lyke a valiaunt souldier he did manfully march on, and not refuse the brunt of the battaile, shee woulde then resigne the fort of her freedome into his hands, and yeelde vp the bulwarke of her breast, which so long he had battered, that triumphauntly he might set vp Trophees in signe of a most victorious conquest. To put therefore the matter in question, she returned him this answere. Maister Gwydonius , your Letter beeing more hastely receiued then heartely read, I perceiue by the contents, that you are still perplexed with your pensicke passions, and that your disease is incurable, for if your pains may be appeased, or your maladie mittigated by no medicine, but by my meanes, you are like either to pay your due vnto death, or still to linger in distresse. My cunning is too small to enterprise the composition of anye secrete simples, and my calling too great to become a Phisition to such a paltering pacient, so that I neither can nor wil cure another mannes harme by mine owne mishap. To loue him whome I cannot like, were but to wreast against mine owne will, to flatter him whome I meane not to fancie, is but a meere tricke of extreame follye. What the cause is Gwydonius , that thy good will reapes so small gaine, and that so rigorously I repaie thy loue with hate, I knowe not, vnlesse the constellation of the Starres by some secrete influence haue so appointed it in the calculation of our natiuitie. But this I am sure, that as no Serpent can abide the smell of a harts horne, as the Panther escheweth the companie of the Ownce, as the Uulture is mortall enimie to ye Eele, and as it is impossible to hatch vp a Swanne in an Eagles neast, to temper Dile & Pitch together in one vessell, to mire the bloud of a Lyon and a Woolfe in one bowle, and to procure amitie betweene the Fawlcon called Tilo , and the Foxe, so hard is it to procure me by ruthfull request to be thy friend, which am by instinct of nature thy protested foe, and as harde to winne me to thy wife, who so little likes of thy loue, that the verie remembrance of thy person makes me fal into most hatefull passions. Cease the Gwydonius to condempne me of crueltie, and leaue off at last to appeale to my curtesie, for thou shalt alwayes bee sure to feele the one, & neuer to finde the other. Yet least thou shouldest accuse me of ingratitude, though I cannot inwardly mittigate thy miserie, yet I will outwardlye teach thee to applie such plaisters (as if the experience of them proue true) shall greatly appease thy paine. Plinie Gwydonius reporteth, that hee which drinketh of the riuer Auerna , cooleth and mortifieth his affections, but if the water be toucht by any meanes before it be drunke, the vertue thereof is of no value. He that weareth the feathers of the Birde Ezalon about him, shall euer bee fortunate in his loue, but if they bee not pulde when the Sunne is eclipsed, they are of no force: and to conclude, ther is nothing that sooner driueth awaie amorous conceits, the to rub ye temples of thy head with ye sweat of an Asse, which if you canne performe it, as no doubt you may put it in practise, I hope you shall be redressed from your intollerable griefe, and I released from such an importunate sute. Forced by the destinies still to denie thee, Castania. Gwydonius hauing viewed and reuiewed ouer this Letter, seeing ye rigorous resolution of his mistres, could by no meanes be remoued, and that a most seuere sentence was pronounced against him by a most iniurious Iudge, was driuen into a doubt whether he should styll with plaints sue for pittie, or else blasphemously exclaim against her brutish crueltie, whether he should bewraie his parents and parentage to the Duke and her, or still stand to the doubtfull chaunce of Fortune, to pursue his purpose still with plaints, her hellish crueltie perswaded him: to blaspheme against her, the sinceritie of his loue would not let him: to bewraie his birth, diuerse daungers might insue: to stand to the chaunce of Fortune, was still to hazard without hope: combred thus with diuers cogitations, at last he determined to breake vp the batterie, and to laie to an inuincible hold, but to returne with as much speede as might be to his father Clerophontes Court, there by absence to mittigate the maladie which so grieuously molested him: yet he thought before his departure to giue her a friendly farewell, that might both confirme his constancie, and condempne her crueltie, which he framed to this effect. I meane not, most mercilesse mistresse, any longer to sue for mercie, nor with pittifull plaints to trouble your patience, sith to stirre that which the Starres hath staied, is to striue against the streame, and to force that which the fates haue framed, is to couet to be counted a foole, but as one whom fortune meanes to make a myrrour of miserie, and ouer whom Venus her selfe meanes to daunt as of a most haplesse vassall, I sorrowfully send you this fainting farewel, as a faithfull token of my feruent affection, for seeing neither my person canne please, nor my liuing like you, nor my base calling content you, nor I my selfe reape any guerdon for my good will, to auoid the remembrance of these passions, which renue my paines, & to asswage the rigour of my raging loue, I purpose as speedely as wind & weather will permit me, to abandon ye place of your abode, not incensed by furie, as one in despight, but inforced by ye rage of fancy to depriue my selfe of al delight, either to consume in solitarie cares without compassion, or by absence to mittigate some part of my martirdome: for to hope stil I see is but to heap wo vpon wretchednes, and care vpon calamitie Yet madam thus much I say, yt Dido queene of Carthage loued Aeneas , a banished exile, and a stragling stranger Enphinia daughter to the king of Corinth , & heire apparant to his crowne, who for her feature was famous throughout all the East Countries, vouchsafed to applie a soueraigne plaister to the furious passions of Acharisto , her fathers bondman. The dutchesse of Malphey chose for her husbad her seruat Vltico , & Venus , who for her surpassing beuty was canonized for a Goddesse disdained not the loue of limping. Vulcan , they madame respected the man, and not their money, their wils, & not their wealth, their loue, not their liuings, their constancie, not their coine: their perso, not their parentage: & the inward vertue, not ye outward value. But you are so addicted to the opinion of Danae , yt vnlesse Iupiter himselfe be shrouded in your lappe, vnder the shape of a shower of golde, he shall haue the repulse, for all his deitie: seeing then it is not in my poore power, either to performe or practise it, I cease off to seeke for impossibilities: promising in what coast or Country so euer I shall remaine, to haue my heart wholy dedicated to your diuine beautie and vertue, both by dutie and seruice, and so commending my selfe to you, and committing my health to the Gods, I bid you farewell. Yours while he is, Gwydonius sans espoier. Castania hauing receiued this Letter from Gwydonius , perceiuing the constant mind of the young Gentleman, yt these his protestations were not vanity, but veritie: not trifling, but troth: no signes of fleeting fancie, but of a firme affection: standing a while in a dumpe, at last she fell into this discourse. I now (quoth she) both see and trie by experience, that there is no fish so fickle, but will come to the baite, no Doe so wilde, but will stande at the gaze, no Hawke so haggard, but will stoope at the lure, no Niesse so ramage but will be reclaimed to the Lunes, no fruit so fine, but the Caterpiller wil consume it, no Adamant so hard but will yeelde to the File, no mettall so strong, but wyll bend to the stampe, no maide so free, but Loue will bring her to bondage and thraldome. And doe I call it bondage fond foole, to bee bound vnto beautie, is it slauery to be subiect vnto vertue? is it thraldome to liue in league with him who wil like me in my youth, and loue me in my age, in whom I shall finde nothing but pleasure and contentation: who will be the hauen of my happinesse, wherein I may rest: and the port of my prosperitie, wherein I may be safe harboured from the tempests of froward fortune, and shroud me from the bitter blasts of bale: Shall I repent me sith my bargaine is good, or complaine of the losse of libertie, sith I haue a change for farre more worthie chaffer? Shal I grudge when ye gods are agreed, or defer it, whe the destinies driue it: or froune at it, sith fortune frames it? No, Gwydonius is my Saint and him will I serue he is my ioy, and him will I inioy. He hath laide the siege, and he shall sacke the citie, he hath abode the batterie, and he shall haue the bulwarke of my breast, he hath fought the combat, and he shall bee victor in the conquest. For I cannot be so vnnaturall, to reward his loue with loathing, so without reason to defraude him of his right, so diuellish for his deepe desire, to giue him a dolefull dish of dispaire. No, no, I haue setteled with my selfe, that if euer I marrie, Gwydonius shall bee the man I will match with. And therefore as I haue driuen him with delayes, and fro him with follie, so nowe I will send him a setteled answere of my good will and fauour, as I haue giuen him cutting corasiues, so I will sende him confectes of comfort. As I haue bene fearefull to shew my liking for the better triall, so now I will be bolde to shew my loue in token of a better trust, and with that she wrote him a Letter to this effect. fortune or the fates can allowe him. requests of his most deerest friends, wtout great entrety  & long sute, answered, yt things lightly grauted (though neuer so costly) are finally accounted of, which saying Gwydonius , I take as a sufficiet excuse for my folly, for my straightnes in words was no stragnes in minde, my bitter speeches were written with my hand, not wrought with my heart, my deniall was onely for the better triall, and those rigorous repulses were either to rip vp thy fained fancie or feruent affection, for if thou hadst retired at the first foile, I would haue thought thy fancie but a flash, readie to be quenched with the least missing deaw of misfortune. But since thou hast kept thy course so rightly by thy compasse, amidst most daungerous rockes, and hast stoode to thy tackling against all the blustering blasts of fortune. Assure thy selfe in liew of this thy loue, thou hast not heeretofore found me so disdainfull, as heerafter thou shalt find me dutifull, neither did I euer reiect thee so currishlye, as I will accept thee curteously, being redie to restore the iniurie I haue offered thee, with anye courtesie that thou maist eyther honestly require, or I iustly affoord. But alas Gwidonius what curtesie shall I euer be able to shew thee, that may counteruaile thy kindnes? How entirely shal I loue thee to requite thy loyaltie? what duetie can be a due recompence to this thy good will: yea, if I by any meanes canne quit this thy loue, I neuer doubt to bee deemed ingratefull while I liue: Thy worthy constancie ( Gwydonius ) hath wonne the castle which many haue besieged, & thou hast obtained yt which diuerse haue sought to gaine: yet it is not the shape of thy beautie, but the hope of thy loialtie which entiseth me, not thy faire face, but thy faithfull heart: not thy comely countenaunce, but thy modest curtesie, not thy words, but thy vertues: not thy wealth, but thy wit: for she that builds her fancie vpon such fading subiects, tieth her loue to the inconstant wheele of fortune. And what though the Duke my father be incensed against me, for making (in his minde) so carelesse a choice? What care I for his friendship, so I haue thy fauour, let him fret, let my friends frowne, let liuinges be lost, hap what hap wil, no misting showers of mischance, no boysterous blasts of aduersitie, no terrible tempestes of disaster fortune, shall make my constant minde in any respect to mooue: no torments, no trauaile, no care, no calamitie, no penurie, no pouertie, no onely the losse of life shall diminish my loue, in liew whereof remain thou but constant, and in pledge of my protested good will, haue heere my heart and hand, to be thine in duste and ashes. Thine, though the Gods say no: Castania. This Letter being most luckelye deliuered into the hands of Gwydonius , I leaue you to iudge Gentleme into what a quadarie this youg youth was brought to see such a sodaine chaunge, and so happie a chaunce, as to haue his hellish bale requited with heauely blasse, his despightfull annoy, with delightfull ioye: his heauinesse with happinesse, and doubtfull despaire tourned to assured hope: to see Fortune which of late defied him as a foe, now to imbrace him as a friend, and to will that he did wish: to see his mistres crueltie tourned to curtesie, her disdaine to desire, her bitter pilles to sugured potions, her stormie repulses to calme consent, and her contemptuous protestations, to most constant promises. For if the carefull captiue, who by the doome of the Iudge expecteth each hower to die, reioyceth when he heareth his pardon pronouced, no doubt Gwydonius ioye could be no losse, sith deniall was his death, and consent the conserue to heale his wounds: the greater care, the greater ioye, the more paine the greater pleasure, the more hellish miserie the more heauenly felicitie. Yea, Gwydonius was driuen into such an extasie for ioy, that he was in doubt, whether this letter was preferred to him in deede, or presented to him in a Uision, whether hee were wrapte into a Traunce, or rauished with some drowsie slumber: but at last perceiuing it to be no fained fantasie, such a deep desire inforced his affection, as he thought euery moment a month, euery houre a yeare, euerye daye a thousande, vntill hee might freely enioy the presence and sight of his loue and Ladie Castania . Fortune meaning to aduaunce him to the toppe of her inconstant wheele, brought it so to passe, that before the weeke was ended, he spied Castania walking alone in the garden: which sodaine sight so reuiued his sences, yt without anye dread or doubt he manfully marcht on towards her, and was as hastely & hartely incountred by Castania : who embracing Gwydonius in her armes, welcommed him with this salutation. As the Whale ( Gwydonius ) maketh alwayes signe of great ioye at the sight of the fish called Talpa Marina , as the Hynde greatlye delyghteth to see the Leoparde, as the Lion fawneth at the viewe of the Unicorne, and as he which drinketh of the Fountaine Hypenis in Scithia , feeleth his mind so drowned in delight, that no greefe though neuer so great, is able to asswage it: so Gwydonius I conceiue such surpassing pleasure in thy presence, and such heauenlye felicitie in the sight of thy perfection, that no miserie though neuer so monstrous is able to amaze me, no dolour though neuer so direfull is able to daunt me, nor no mishap though neuer so perillous, is able to make me sinke in sorrow, as long as I inioy thy presence, which I count a soueraine preseruatiue against all carefull calamities. That as he which tasteth of the hearbe Hyacynthus is neuer combred with care, and as he that weareth the stone Agathes about him, is surely defenced against all insuing sorrrowes, so inioying the sight of thy seemely selfe, and feeding mine eyes with the forme of thy feature, I think my selfe sufficiently shrowded against all the tempestuous showers of sinister fortune. And to proue these my promises to be no fained vanities but faithfull veritie, I commit my selfe, my stay, and state into thy hands to dispose of me at thy plesure, wishing rather to liue with thee in most distressed penurie, than to linger heere in most fortunate prosperitie. with the sight of her sweete face, and so rapt into a traunce with the contemplation of her beautie, that as the Lyon tasting of the gumme Arabicke becommeth senselesse, as the Bul by browsing on the barke of a Iuniper tree falleth a sleepe, as the Camill standeth astonished at the sight of a Rat: so Gwydonius seeing in his armes the Saint whom in heart hee did honour, and imbracing the Goddesse whome with most deepe deuotion hee did adore, was so amazed, that he was not able to vtter one worde as witnesse of his happinesse, vntill at last gathering his wits together, he beganne thus to reply. ioyned hard to the sight, hindereth the sence, the flower put into the nosethrill stoppeth the smelling, the Wine vessell beeing full, lets passe no wine though neuer so well vented, the water-pot beeing filled to the brimme, yeeldes forth no licour, though hauing a thousand holes: so where the minde is surcharged with ouermuch ioy, or too much pleasure, there the tongue is both tied, and the sences so restrained, that the heart is neither able to conceiue the ioye, nor the tongue able to expresse the pleasure. Which Castania I nowe speake by proofe, and knowe by experience, for I am so drowned in delight by inioying that princely Iemme, which I esteeme the rarest and richest Iewell, not onely in Alexandria , but in all the worlde, and so puffed vp in pleasure by thy diuine presence. Yea, thy faithfull and vnfained affection, the promise of thy constancie, and the hope of thy loyaltie, the report of thy chastitie, & the renowme of thy modestie, the force of thy beautie, & the fame of thy vertue. But aboue all thy prodigall bountie, in bestowing these heauenlye perfections on thy poore Gwydonius , beeing by person and parentage most vnworthy to possesse them, so surchargeth my silly heart with excessiue ioye, that my tongue not being able in part to expresse the extreame pleasure of my minde, I am with Philistion the Comicall Poet, constrayned by silence to vnfolde that affection, which in words the filed phrase of Demosthenes were not able to decypher. But this assure thy selfe Castania , that if Iuno wold aduance me to be Monarch of the world, if Pallas would preferre me to exceede hautie Hercules in valour, if Venus wold present me with some princely peece of heuenly perfection, yet would I not so gladly receiue their proffers, as I doo gratefully accept the promise of thy loue and loyaltie. No, I accompt the treasure of Croesus but trash, in respect of the guerdon of thy good will: I accompt the fortune of Caesar but folly, respecting the fruites of thy fauour: I esteeme the dignities of Priamus as dregs, in respect of thy diuine perfection. Yea Castania , I am so snared with thy beautie, and so intangled in the trap of thy bountie, as I shall neuer leaue to loue thee, nor euer beginne to like any other. It is easie Gwydonius (quoth Castania ) to purchase credite, where the partie is alreadie perswaded, and to infer beleefe, where euery word is counted an Oracle, Therefore omitting these friuolous protestations, thus much I say touching the purpose. Cecillius Metellus was wont to say, that as it was necessary that old men shuld be graue in counsaile, so it was expedient young men should be secret in loue, and therefore when the contract was made betweene Fuluius and his daughter, he sealed vp their lippes with his signet, meaning that to violate the secret conference of louers, was to commit a second sacriledge. I speake this Gwydonius , as one carefull of thy staye and my state: for if Orlanio my father should but once heare of our loue, or suspect our liking, it wold breede thy mishap and my miserie: yea, no doubt hee would speedely preuent our pretence, which woulde bee thy care and my calamitie. Dispose our affaires at thy pleasure, but discouer not our purpose, if thou hast won the castell vaunt not of the conquest, if thou hast made a good market, bragge not of thy gaines, lest by boasting of thy bootie, thou loose thy pray and be thought a pratler. And Gwydonius aboue all men beware of Valericus , least vnder the shape of a friend, he proue in tyme thy mortall foe, least his fained amitie proue faithlesse emnitie: that in trusting too much without triall, thou finde not treason: and then though thou repent, yet had I wist cometh too late, & so thou wish thou hadst neuer loued, and I neuer liked. Tush Castania (quoth Gwydonius ) he that is afraide to venter on the Bucke because he is tapisht in the briers, shall neuer haue hunters happe, and he that puts his doubt in loue for euery chaunce, shal neuer haue louers lucke. Cannot the Cat catch Mice, without she haue a bell hanged at her eare? Cannot the Hobbie seaze on his praye but he must checke? Cannot the Spaniell retryue the Partridge, but he must quest? and cannot we deale so warely but all the worlde must wonder at it? Yes, it is a subtill birde that breedes among ye aerin of Hawkes, and a shifting Sheepe that Lambes in the Foxes Denne, and he shall looke narrowlye, that spyes me halting. Let Orlanio not onely weigh our workes, but our wordes, and let Valericus both deeme our deeds, and deuine our thoughts, and yet I hope we will deale so secretlye in our affaires, as neither the one shal haue cause to suspect our familiaritie, nor the other to detect our affection. And therefore Castania least (if we bee spyed) the time and place giue occasion of mistrust, I will leaue you as I found you, and so farewell. Well these two louers placed thus by fortune in the Pallaice of earthlye prosperitie, floated so securelye in the streames of blisse, as they thought no chips of mischaunce might chaunge their present happinesse to future heauines, as long as their priuie contract was kept so secret to themselues. But as they which cannot see fire in the strawe are stone blinde: so he that cannot see the flame of fancie is a foole. It is harde to couer smoake, but more harde to conceale loue, which these two Louers in tract of time tryed true. Who as closely as they kept their cloake, yet it was most easie to espie the lining: for fancie secretly restrayned, is like the sparke couered with ashes, which at length bursteth into a great flame. For there passed betweene Gwydonius such amorous glaunces, such louing lookes, such courteous congies, such countenaunces, and such friendlye familiaritie, such often meetings, such open greetings, such sighes, such sobbes, and such straunge passions, as not onely Valericus but all the Courte (though they poore soules, thought to daunce in a Nette and not bee seene) perceiued how entirelye they loued, and lyked each other. Which as it did not displease many which loued Gwydonius as their friend, so it greatly despited Valericus which was his foe, to see one of small countenaunce preferred before one of his callyng, that Gwydonius shoulde winne the Bulwarke which he so long had battered: that hee pitching the Field, another shuld obtaine the Conquest: that hee laying the siege, another shoulde vaunt of the victorye: that while he beat the Bush, another shoulde catche the Birdes: and that the meede of his merite, should be giuen to one of small deserte. Beeing combred with these cholaricke cogisations, and perplexed with these despightfull passions, inflamed with wrathfull furie, he fell into these termes. O Goddes (quoth hee) what courtesie is there to bee sounde in such Kytes of Croesus kinde, or what constancie is there to bee hoped for, in suche dayntye disdayning Dames? whose wauering wills and staylesse wittes both waxe and wane with the Moone, whose Lunaticke mindes chaunge with euerye suddayne motion: yea, whose lyghtnesse and leawdnesse is suche, as they delyght with the Rauen to feede en the moste loathsome fleshe, with the shee Woolfe to choose the fowlest Make, with Aesops Cocke to preferre the barley Corne before a most precious pearle, & with Glaucus to make a chaunge of his golden armour for brazen harnesse. Didde not Euphinia forsake most famous Princes, and imbrace a most infamous Bondeslaue? Didde not Sirichia the Princesse of Denmarke reiecte moste Princelye Potentates, and at laste accepte a poore Peasaunt? Yea, didde not Venus her selfe with the beetle, disdain all day to light on the most fragrant flowers, and at night vouchsafeth to lodge in a filthie cowsheard: I meane, did shee not refuse the renowmed Gods, and choose a most deformed Smith. Why, but Valericus , is it fancie that forceth them to this folly? Doth loue lead them? doo the Destenies driue them? doth beautie allure them? Is it their countenance that constraineth them? no, they are clownes: is it their person or parentage that perswadeth them: no, they are pesants. But like craftie Calipsos they thinke by these vnequall matches to rule the roste after their owne dyet, to be soueraigne Mistres of their owne mindes, with Venus to let Vulcan possesse the tree, and Mars enioye the fruite, to haue their husbands feede the sheepe, & some other reape the fleece: vnder the shaddowe of his heade, doo defende themselues from such heate, as would otherwise greatly scorch their credite, to make him followe the bent of their bowe, although he set the Cuckoldes end vpward. It is a simple cloake that cannot couer one from a shower of raine, and a silly husband that is not able to father that another dooth beget. But to see howe these gallaunt girles, if they like not the partie, what shewe of shamefastnesse they will make, how they will vale their face with the visour of virginitie, howe they will cloake themselues with the colour of continencie, how charie they will be of their chastitie: whereas if they fancie, who so loose of their lips, and free of theyr flesh as they. But Valericus , why doost thou thus reckelessely raile and rage against womankinde. It is not Castania that thus crosseth thee with care, but Gwydonius that breedeth thy griefe. It is not shee that inferreth thy sore, but hee that procureth thy sicknesse. Shee is not the meanes of thy maladye, but hee the hinderer of thy medicine. Shee is not the worker of thy woe, but he is the sower of thy sorrowe. And shall hee bee puffed vp with prosperitie, and I pressed downe with miserie? shall he swimme in wealth, and I sinke in want? shall he hath in blisse, and I waile in woe? shall he bee pampered vp with pleasure, and I pinde awaie with penurie? No, I will either spoile him, or spill my selfe, in despight of the fates and fortune. While thus Valericus sought opportunitie to reuenge his wrath vppon guiltlesse Gwydonius , Fortune minding to bewraie her immutabilitie, brought it so to passe, that whereas Orlanio was accustomed to paie a yeerely tribute to the duke of Metelyne , which surmounted to the sum of thirtie thousand Duckets, either wilfully or vnwittingly he with-held this debt, which Clerophontes claimed as his due, insomuch that beeing demanded by Embassage for ye paiment of this tribute, hee flatly answered, that he would not from hence foorth disburse one denier, & he was sorrie that in paying it heeretofore he proued himselfe such a foole. Wherevpon Clerophontes being fraught with raging fury, was so incensed against Orlanio , that taking counsaile of his nobilytie, he determined with as much speede as might bee, to wage battaile against him, and to obtaine that by constraint, which he denyed him of curtesie. As thus he was musing with himselfe whom he shuld appoint Captaine generall of his armie, because he meant not in proper person to abide the hazarde of the battaile, the remembraunce of his sonne Gwydonius , came into his minde, which not onely amazed him, but so molested him, as hee was driuen into most distressed dolour, now he called to minde his mercilesse crueltie in correcting his faults, and his moodlesse rigour in rebuking his folly: nowe he bewailed his long absence, and wished his speedie presence: yea, he was so diuersly perplexed, as he began thus dolorously to discourse with himselfe. Alasse (quoth he) now I see the saying of Cicero to be true, that who so wilfullye peruerteth the lawes of nature, seemeth to proclaime himselfe an enimie to the Gods: for that Nature neuer framed anye thing amisse, wherein I haue most grieuously offended: For in beastly rage I haue surpassed the brute beasts, and in crueltie the sencelesse creatures: I haue beene more deuoyde of pittie then the fowles of the aire, and more vnnaturall then the Fishes of the Sea. The Birde called Apis Indica , seeing the venimous Uiper readie to deuour her young ones in the neast, presenteth her selfe to death, to preserue them from destruction. The Eagle is so carefull ouer her young, that if it happe by her default one of them doe perish, shee willinglye woundeth her selfe in many places with her owne beake. The Lyon so louingly fostereth vp her Whelpes, that shee neuer tasteth of the praie vntyll they bee fullye satisfied. The Foxe is so carefull ouer her cubbes, that shee willingly falleth into the Hunters handes to defende hir young from harme. But I vilde wretch, (as though I had drunke of the Ryuer Lincestis in Bohemia , which presently tourneth whatsoeuer it toucheth into stones. In steede of friendly courtesie, haue abused mine owne sonne with frowning crueltie, in liew of mercie I haue brought him to miserie, the fatherlye affection I haue shewed him, hath beene raging furie: yea, my rygorous Nature, naye rather my vnnaturall rage hath beene such towardes him, as hee lyueth a bannished exile in a straunge Countrey, perhappes pinched wyth penurye, oppressed with pouertie, wandering in the wilde Desartes, in daunger of deuouring, in peryll of spoyling, afflicted not onelye with the maladie of the bodie, but the miserie of the minde: so that no doubte hee wisheth that I had neuer beene Father to such a sonne, or he neuer sonne to such a Father. Alasse what ioye canne I nowe enioy, when I want my onely ioye? What comfort canne I haue to see my childe in calamitie? What pleasure canne I take while hee toyleth in penurie, who nowe in mine age shoulde bee the staffe whereon to staie, that by his valyaunt courage and warlike prowesse (wherewith from his infancie hee hath beene indewed) might defend mee from mine enimies, and reuenge mee of my foes. But alasse I lament too late, the calme commeth out of time, when the Shippe alreadie hath suffered shipwracke, and these pittifull plaintes little preuaile, where the patient is alreadie pushed into perill. No, no, my rage hath beene too greate, to heare of his hastie retourne, my peruerse furie hath beene such, as hee dare not abide my presence: and surely my sorrowe is too greate euer to bee salued. And with that Clerophontes start vp, minding to reuenge these his cholarike cogitations by bloudie battaile, vppon the confines of Alexandria , and therefore in greate hast mustered all his men, made great prouisions for the warre, and caused his Nauie to bee rigged, for that hee meant to conueie his armie by sea into Alexandria . While thus there was no worde through the whole Dukedome of Meteline but warre, warre, and no newes but of the cruell conflicte that shoulde insue betweene the two Dukes. Certaine Merchauntes of Alexandria , which then roade in the Hauen, durst not goe a shoare to sell their commodities, but as fast as Winde and weather would serue them, highed them out of the harbour, and coasted speedely into their owne countrie: wher they no sooner arriued, but they made reporte thereof to Orlanio , who driuen into a dumpe wyth this noysome newes, whether he doubted of the puissant power of Clerophontes , who was such a worthie warriour, and in battaile so bolde, that no man durst abide him, or whether he feared his owne force was not able to resist the furie of his raging enimie. He presently summoned all his Lordes to a Parliament, where after some conference, it was concluded, that Thersandro should bee sent Embassadour to Metelyne to parle of peace with Clerophontes , which determination was no whit deferred, but with as much speede as might be, the barke wherein he should passe was prouided, the charge of the Embassage was giuen him, & he accompanied with a traine of braue Gentlemen, departed. But if this newes was dolefull to Orlanio , no doubt it was death it selfe to Gwidonius , who hearing that his Father would bend his force against the place, wherein he was. Sawe all possibilitie taken awaie from obtayning his purpose. For he feared death if he were knowen to Orlanio , and he doubted despightfull hate at the least if he bewraide himselfe to Castania . Which double dolour so distressed him, as he felte himselfe diuersly perplexed with dumpish passions, his mirth was tourned to mourning, his pleasaunt conceits, to painefull cogitations: his wanton toyes, to wailing thoughtes, now he abondoned all good companie, and delighted onely in solytarie life, the wilesome woodes were his wished walkes, and the secret shades the couert he chiefly coueted. In fine, he seemed rather a Tymon of Athens , then a Gentleman of Alexandria , so that all the Court meruailed at this so sodaine a chaunge: but especially Castania , who coiecturing his doleful hart by his drousy looks, was astonished at this his strange state, casting in her mind whether she had giuen him any cause of this care, or whether by her occasion he was crossed with this calamitie. But alas poore soule, howsoeuer she aimed she mist ye marke, for Gwydonius felte his disease so secrete, as hee knewe none could but himselfe deuine the cause of his maladie, which no doubt was such, that it woulde haue inferred present death, if he had not hoped for some happie newes by Thersandro . Who no sooner luckely ariued at Metelyne , but Clerophontes was certified, that the Dukes son of Alexandria was come to impart with his grace some waightie matters of importaunce. Nowe at this instaunt when the message was brought him, his Daughter Lewcippa was by, who (as the Nature of women is, desirous to see and bee seene) thought she woulde both heare the parle , and viewe the person of this young Embassadour, and therefore found fish on her fingers, that she might staye still in the chamber of presence, whether presently Thersandro was sent for, who curteously and curiously dooing his obysaunce to the Duke, deliuered his Embassage in this manner. Where-as (right worthie sir) Orlanio , the Duke of Alexandria , more vnwittingly then wilfully denyed certaine tribute, which hee confesseth both hee and his predecessours haue paide to you and your auncestours. Hearing that heerevppon your grace meaneth rather to wage battaile, then to loose anie parte of your due although he feareth not your force, as one able euery way to withstand it, nor passeth of your puissaunce, as a Potentate sufficient to resist your power. Yet, the care hee hath of his subiectes safetie, and the loue hee hath to preserue the life of his commons, the regard he hath to paie and performe that which conscience and custome requireth, and lastly, meaning with Tully, Iniquissimam pacem iustissimo bello anteponere . Hee hath sent mee both to sue for conditions of peace, and to pay the tribute, which if your grace shall refuse, of force he must put his hope in the hazard of Fortune. him that vpon a sodaine he woulde not dispatche so waightie a matter, but meant first both to consulte and take counsaile of his Nobles: which done, within three dayes hee shoulde haue an aunswere. In the meane time hee commaunded Lucianus the Steward of his house, verie courteouslye to intreate both Thersandro and his traine, and to feast them with such sumptuous fare, as they might haue cause most highly to extoll his magnificence. But leauing Clerophontes to consult with his learned counsaylours, and Thersandro to companie with the lustie Courtiers, againe to Lewcippa , who while this young youth was telling of his tale, neuer markte the matter, but the man, nor regarded not the parle , but respected the person: neuer noted the contents, but viewed his countenance: In such sort, that shee was so scorched with the fire of fancie, and so scalded with the flame of affection, so bewitched with his beautie, and so inueagled with his bountie, as hee was the onelye man that made her checke at the praie, bate at the Lure, and wyllingly yeelde to the first assaulte of fancie. And on the other side, Fortune so fauoured, that Thersandro printing in his heart the perfection of Lewcippas person, felte his freedome so fettered by the viewe of her heauenly face, and so snared in the beames of her amorous glaunces, that hee wisht that eyther this discention had neuer growen, or that hee hadde not beene the deliuerer of the message, for hee felt his heart alreadie so ouergrowen wyth good-will towardes this younge Princesse, as no salue but her selfe was able to mittigate his sorrowe, no medicine but her courtesse was able to cure his calamitie, and hee thought to preferre his sute to his professed foe, was follie: to linger still in loue, was death and miserie: to seeke for helpe at her handes, neyther woulde the present state permitte him, nor time suffer him to prosecute his purpose: daunted with these diuerse doubtes to auoyde the melancholike motions that molested his minde, hee presently went from his lodging to the Court, that by companie he might driue awaie these dumpes, where hee found in the great chamber diuerse Ladies and Gentlemen, passing awaie the time in pleasaunt parle , amongst whom was that pearelesse Paragon, princely Lewcippa : who (after due reuerence done to the Gentlewomen in generall) was singled out by Thersandro , and courted in this wise. Madame (quoth hee) if anie creature hath iust occasion to accuse either Nature or the Gods of unustice, man onelye hath the greatest cause to make this complaint, for there is none eyther so depriued of reason, or deuoide of sence, which by some naturall instinct dooeth not skilfully presage of perills before they come, and warily preuent ere they be past. The Goates of Lybia knowe certainelye when the Canicular dayes beginne, wherein commonlye they fall blinde, and therefore by eating the hearbe Polopodium they prouidentlye preuent their disease. When the Lyon leaueth his Lawnes, and raungeth in forraine Desertes, hee alwayes foresheweth a drought. When the Fish called Vranascapos sinketh downe to the bottome of the Sea, hee bewrayeth greate tempestes to bee imminent. But man is so farre from this secrete foresight, that not onelye hee cannot deuine of these ensuinge daungers, but rather wilfullye or willing, pusheth himselfe into most manifest perills, which madame, I speake, as feeling my selfe distressed with this want. For if I had bene indued with this sacred prescience, perfectly to presage of ensuing perilles, I had not ben crossed with such cares as I am like to incur, nor hadde cause to repent this my present arriuall. But sith lacke of such skill hath procured my losse, and that when the hurt is had it is too late to take heede, though reuealing of my mishappe cannot heale my miserie, nor repeating of my paines redresse my sorrowe: yet, I meane to participate my passions to your good grace, that though you cannot or will not mittigate my maladie, yet you maye pittie my estate, which will somewhat ease my heauinesse. I came to your Fathers Court madame, a free man of Alexandria , and am lyke to retourne a captiue of Metelyne , I arriued deuoyde of care, and am lyke to departe, drenched with calamitie: I landed free from affection, but feare to passe hence fraught with fancie: my charge was onely to parle of peace, but my chaunce is to discourse of passions. Yea, your beautie hath so fettered my freedome, and so snared my heart in the linkes of your loue, that it shall neuer bee raced out by anye sinister meanes of Fortune, although I see it is almost impossible to obtayne it. For I doubte our parents are lyke to proclayme themselues professed foes, and the vrgent necessitie of my affayres, forceth mee to departe so speedelye, as want of time wyll not suffice to make tryall of my loue, whereby I might claime a sufficient guerdon for my good wyll: yet howsoeuer the matter shall happe, whether my hope be voide, or my happe be vaine, I meane madame to remaine yours for euer. Lewcippa tooke such delight in hearing Thersandro discourse so louingly, as she could scarely keepe her countenaunce from bewraying the pleasure she conceiued in this parle , seeing that her loue was requited with lyking, and her fancie incountered with the like affection. Yet least Thersandro should thinke her too curteous if she shuld come at the first call, and very light of loue, to like at the first looke, she framed him this aunswere. Sir (quoth she) if of your sute for conditions of peace there insue no better successe than the reuealing of your passions shall reape pittie at my handes, or if the intreatie for truce be as lightly respected by my Father, as either your person or petition is regarded by me, you are like to carrie home cold newes to your coutrey, and to vaunt that you bad faire, but bought little: that your Haruest was long, but your corne not worth the cropping: that your venter was much, but your gaines such, as if your winnings proue no better, you are lyke to liue by the losse. For sir, doo you suppose mee so sottish, as to thinke euery one that flatters dooth fancie, or so addicted to selfe loue, as by a few filed phrases to be brought into a fooles Paradice: knowing that it is the fashion of men by their fained subtiltie to deceiue our faithfull simplicitie. No, for if you meane to counterfaite, take this for a rule, it is ill halting before a creple. But sir, this your sodaine liking bewrayes ye lightnesse of your loue, this your fonde affection, imports the ficklenesse of your fancie: for soone hot, soone cold? easely inflamed, as quickly quenched: like to the Apples of Arabia , which begin to rot, ere they be halfe ripe. And if I meant to loue, had I none to like but my Fathers foe? should I desire him whom my Father dooth detest? And if I should so farre forget mine owne staye, or my Fathers state, as to consent, it were impossible either to appease his wrath, or to get ye graunt of his good will, so yt to desire yt which I can neuer inioy, wer to driue my self wholy into despair, which wold smally profit you, and greatlye displeasure me, and therefore cease to sue for that, which maye well be wisht, but neuer obtained. Thersandro although he heard Lewcippa decide the case sufficiently, yet he was so wilfull, that he woulde not take her doome for a verdite, but retourned her this replye. Madame (quoth he) where in liew of hate there insueth loue, it is alwayes the signe of the greater affection: and that it is a thing either confirmed by the Fates, or appointed by the Gods. Tereus the Prince of Thrace , being sent by his Father to defie Pandion the king of Athens , was enamoured of his daughter Progne , whereby betweene the Parents in steede of fatall enmitie, there insued friendly amitie. When as the bloudie warres betweene Atis the King of Libia , and Lycabas the Prince of Assur was most hot, young Admetus being sent Ambassadour into Libia , was so stroken in loue with Alcest , onely Daughter to his fathers foe, and she repaying his lyking with such loyaltie, as death it selfe could neuer dissolue their amitie. If madame, these premisses may perswade you to take pittie of my passions, or these examples induce you, not to let the hatred of our parents be a hindrance of our loue, whether your father reiect me as a foe, or accept me as a friende, I doubt not but the destinies will driue the bargayne through, in despite of them and fortune. Sir (quoth she) I confesse Progne poore wench loued Tereus , but how wretchedly did he reward her loyaltie? and Scylla was enamored of Minos her fathers foe, but how tyrannously did he repay her loue with treacherie, Tarpeia betrayed the Tower of Rome to one of the Sabynes whom she most entirely loued, but the meede of her merite was extreame miserie. Shall I then Thersandro see the traine and yet fall into the trappe, shall I spie the nettes, and yet strike at the stale? shall I see the mishap, and yet wilfully incurre the mischaunce, no I meane not for an inch of ioye, to reape an ell of annoy, for a moment of mirth a month of miserie, for a dram of pleasure, a whole pound of paine, and by procuring mine owne delight to purchase my fathers death and destruction. But let this suffice Thersandro to signifie how I pittie thy passions, and thinke wel of thy person, that if my Fathers will might be framed to my wish, if he would condiscend as I would consent, thou onely art the man who in the way of mariage shoulde dispose of me at thy plesure. But sith the frowning state of Fortune denies our loue to haue such happie successe, hope well, and rest vpon this poynt, that I will alwaies like thee as a friend, though not loue thee as my pheere. As Thersandro was ready to replye, and to seale vp the bargaine of their loue vppon her sweete lippes, Clerophontes came in, who marred all their market, & tourned their sweete to sower, for he gaue Thersandro his aunswere before Lewcippa , which was this. That he neither ment to accept of the conditions of peace, nor to receiue the tribute, but to claime his due by the doubtfull euent of battaile. That he shortly pretended in person to visite Orlanio , and within the walls of Alexandria to demaund his debt, and that he would bestow his Fathers Dukedome vpon a Lord of his called Lucianus in dowrie with his Daughter Lewcippa . Thersandro was nothing amazed with the first part of the message, but when he hearde howe Clerophontes meant presumptuously both to depraue him of his lyuing, and depriue him of his Loue, he was so puffed vp with wrath and chollar, as hap what hap would, he fell into these tearmes. I remember (quoth he) that Caligula the Emperour prouiding a mightie armie to subdue great Britaine , when he was come to the Sea, readie to post ouer his Souldiours in his Nauie, he lefte off his endlesse enterprise, and set them to gather Cockles. Siphax boldly boasting that he would bestowe the kingdome of Numidia vpon his second Sonne, was by Massinissa ouerthrowen, and solde as captiue to the Romanes . I dare not sir inferre comparisons, because they be odious, nor apply the examples, sith time and place forbids me: but this I say, that to fish before the net, is alwaies counted folly, and to vaunt before the victorie, is but vanitie. Yea, and if I had as good right to your Daughter Lewcippa , as I haue to the supposed Dowrie which you assigne her, I woulde in despight of Lucianus and the diuell himselfe, dispose her at my pleasure. Clerophontes hearing the cholaricke conclusion of Thersandro could scarcely bridle his frantick furie from raging without reason against this young youth, yet somewhat mittigating his moode, he breathed out these cruell threatenings. If the lawe of Armes (quoth he) did not both safely protect thee, & surely forbid me to hurt thee in yt thou art a messenger, I would with such seueritie chastice these thy presumptuous speeches, as thou shuldest learn heereafter to answere with more reuerence: yet I wysh thee not to stande too stiffe vpon this poynt, least if thou be so recklesse as to breake the bondes of reason, I be so forgetfull as to passe the lymits of the law. Thou hast receiued a determinate aunswere for the Embassage, & there I charge thee this present day to depart out of my Dominions. Thersandro fearing the tyrannie of this cruell Clerophontes , presently passed out of the Chamber of Presence, taking his leaue of Ladie Lewcippa , onelye with louing lookes, which she requited with such glaunces of good will, as they were sufficient signes what insupportable sorrowe she receiued by his so sodayne departure: yet knowing that her fancie was incountred with mutual affection, she droue away the mystie clowdes of despaire, hoping that the Gods seeing their faithful amitie, would take pitie of their passions, & in time redresse their miserie. But Thersandro hauing with speede dispatchte hys affaires (all his train being set aboord, and they coasting the straights with a luckie gale) was so combred with care, and so ouer-growen with griefe, that he passed no hower, minute, nor moment, without wofull waylyng, sorrowfull sobs, and farre fetcht sighes, so that the Gentlemen his companions, supposing that he was thus painfully perplexed for feare of Clerophontes puissance, began both to comfort and incourage him not to doubte or dread the force of the enimie, sith his father was able to repulse him, without any daunger to himselfe, or any great damage to his subiects. But these their perswasions could no whit preuaile to asswage his passions, this their incouragement coulde not cure his care. But as there is no greater bane to the bodye, than trouble of the minde: so Thersandro so long continued in these pensiue passions, and carefull cogitations, concealing his griefe so couertly, which so much the more furiously flamed within him, that he was constrayned to keepe his Cabbin till his arriuall at Alexandria . Where being set on shore, and presently conueyed to the Courte, he remained for the space of three dayes, so strangely perplexed, as he was not able to make report of his message: which so griped Orlanio with such inspeakable griefe, as he wished rather to haue died valiantly wt the force of hys enimye, than to put the health of his sonne in hazard by passing so perillous a iournie. But Thersandro seeing that sorrow would not salue his sore, but rather increase his sicknesse: that mourning would not appease his maladie, but rather augment his miserie: began to take heart at grasse, and within few dayes began to recouer his former health. And then hee declared to his Father, what he had in charge from Clerophontes , how he meant speedely to wage war against him, & by force of armes to driue him out of his Dukedome, which he had alreadie promised to one Lucianus in dowrie with his Daughter. Orlanio hearing this proud presumption of this bragging Duke, thought the greatest barkers were not alwaies the sorest biters, and that it was farre more easie with words to obtayne the victorie, than with deeds to attayne the Conquest. Yet, least he might be taken at vnwares, he made a generall muster throughout all his Dominions, prouiding in euery place necessarye munition for the defence of hys Countrey. And assembling his Nobilitie to giue theyr verdite, who were fittest to bee Captaines in this skirmish: after some consultation had in this cause, they concluded, that since Clerophontes meant to ioyne battayle in his owne person, that lykewise hee shoulde bee Generall of the field, and Gwydonius who surpassed all the rest in martial exploites, should be Lieuetenant, and conduct the armie, which he no sooner hearde but hee was tormented with inspeakable griefe, he beganne to pull downe his Peacockes feathers, to hang his wings, and crye creake: euery man hoping to winne fame was merrie, but he alone mourning: euery man laughed, & he alone lowred: insomuch, that he was generallye suspected to be a fearfull cowarde, and that dread of daunger draue him into these dolefull dumpes. But as they rashly coniectured the cause of his sorrowe, so they mist the nature of his sicknesse: for Gwydonius seeing that of this cruel conflict his calamitie should ensue, and that this bloudie broyle would breed his bane, he fell into such solitarie surmises, and such musing meditations, that Valericus his open friende and yet his secrette foe, sought by sundry meanes to search out the cause of his care, but not being able to wring out any thing, eyther by flattering promises or fained protestations, he ceased fro his importunate sute. But froward fortune brought it so to passe, that Valericus comming by the chamber of Gwydonius , heard him thus desperatly discoursing with himselfe. Alas (quoth he) I see the Sunne being at the highest declineth, the Sea being at full tide ebbeth: calme continueth not long without a storme, neither is happinesse had long without heauinesse, blisse without bale, weale without woe, mirth without mourning. For who a late so floated in the flouds of felicitie as I, which now by the sinister meanes of frowning fortune am sowsed in the seas of sorrow, exalted alate to the highest degree of happines, am nowe driuen to the greatest extremitie of euill: alate puffed vp with prosperitie, & now pushed downe with aduersitie: yea, alate placed in Paradise, and now plunged in perplexitie. Oh Gwydonius , if thy fathers friendlye preceptes might haue perswaded thee, if his aduice had bene thy aduertisement, and thou hadst carefully kept his counsaile, then by his fore-warning thou hadst bene fore-armed against all mishap and miserie. The force of fickle fancie had not then giuen thee the foyle, loue had not so lyghtly procured thy losse, nor the painted shew of beautie had not so soone procured thy bane. My bane? Why fond foole, beautie hath bred my blisse, fancie hath not giuen me the foyle, but hath yeelded me the fort: Loue hath not wrought my losse, but requited me with treble gaine. Hath not Castania requited my loue with loyaltie, and repayed my good will with mutuall affection? Is shee not my Saint and I her seruaunt? Are wee not contracted together by loue, and shall continue together by lawe? May I not dispose of her in the waye of marriage at my pleasure? Yes, but what then, the more is my grief, and the greater is my care. For if her presence procureth my delight, will not her absence breede my despight? If her consent preserued my life, will not her contempt inferre my death? Yes. For alas since the destinies meane to dissolue that fancie hath decreed, since the frowning fates seeke to vnloose that which loue hath linked, since froward fortune means to break the bonds wherin beautie hath boud vs, since these bloudie broiles will cause Castania (where before shee accepted mee for a friend) nowe to reiecte mee for a foe: What better lucke canne I looke for, then a loathsome lyfe, or what better happe can I hope for, than horrour and heauinesse? Yea, which waye so euer I tourne mee I see nothing but woe and wretchednesse. For if Orlanio perceyued our liking, how would he storme at our loue? If he knew my chaunce, how woulde he fret at his Daughters choyce? Woulde hee euer consent, that Castania should match with so meane a mate, that her princely personage should be disgraced with my base parentage, that her calling shuld be crazed with my slender countenaunce: no, he would no doubt first banish me out of all his dominions. Tush Gwydonius , would God this were the worst, and then thou mightest hope in time by some meanes to redresse this doubt. But if Orlanio shoulde knowe thou wert heire apparaunt to the Dukedome of Metelyne , and onely sonne to Clerophontes , his fatall foe, what torment were there so terrible, which thou shouldest not trie? What paine so pinching, which thou shouldst not passe? What hap so hard which thou shouldest not hazard? Yea, what death so direfull, which at his cruell hands thou shouldest not suffer? And what if Castania were priuy to thy state, dost thou think her so constaunt as to consent to her Fathers for? doest thou thinke she would wish the sonnes weale, when the Father wisheth her mishap? No, assure thy selfe if thy state be once knowen, that Castania wil most deadly detest thee, which will be more grieuous to thee then death it selfe, be it neuer so terrible. Sith then Gwydonius , thou must shortly either go in armes against thine owne father, or else loose both thy loue and thy life, let not delaie breede daunger, but strike on the stith while ye yron is hot, Castania hath promised to forsake both Father, friendes, and her owne countrie, to passe wher and when it pleaseth thee, she doubteth no daungers, shee forceth of no misfortune, she careth for no calamitie, she passeth for no perills, so she inioy thy desired companie, and therefore as speedely as may be, conueie her closely into ye confines of Metelyne , before eyther she know thy staie or thy state. And shall I so practise her with pollicies? shall I so sift her with subtiltie? shall I put so little trust in her troth? and so small confidence in her constancie? as to coceale from her anye secret? No, come woe, come wretchednesse, come death, come daunger, hap what hap will, I will presently impart vnto her my present state, and my pretended purpose. Valericus hearing this doubtfull discourse of Gwydonius , was driuen into an extasie for ioy, to see that hee had found such fit meanes whereby he might not onely purchase the Dukes fauour, aspire vnto honour and dignitie, but also obtaine the loue of Castania , for he meant speedely to preuent the pretence of Gwydonius by vnfolding to the Duke the summe of his secrete purpose, assuring himselfe, that after Orlanio knew his parents and parentage, that hee was sonne and heire to Clerophontes , no price though neuer so precious, no raunsome though neuer so rich, might redeeme him from the most despightfull death that could be deuised. And of these premisses he inferde this conclusion, that the cause bee taken awaie the effect faileth, that Gwydonius beeing reiected, hee should bee receiued: that hee being despighted with hate, he shoulde be requited with loue, and vppon this hope he went presentlye to bewraie this matter to Orlanio , whom he found with his sonne Thersandro , and diuerse other noble men consulting what course they had best take against Clerophontes , whome Valericus saluted in this wise. sentences in all ages haue bene holden as most diuine Oracles, portrayeth out in the books of his Common wealth, the picture of a perfect Citizen, whose liniaments beeing first leuelled, hee tricketh vp with these coulours, that he loue his Prince loyallye, keepe the lawes carfully, and defend his Countrie valyantly, in which three pointes (saith he) consisteth the chiefest duetie of a trustie subiecte: this saying of Plato throughly considered, and calling to minde the sundrie good tournes which without desert your grace hath bestowed vppon me, I thought if I shoulde not repaye your fauour with faithfulnesse, and your trust you repose in me with inuiolable troath, I might bee counted a vicious vassall, deuoide of all vertue, a trecherous Citizen, rather then a trustie subiect, a carelesse slaue, then a carefull Gentleman: yea, a gracelesse monster, misled with ingratitude. I am come (right worthie Sir) not to betraie my foe, but to bewraie my friende, not to discouer the fault of my enimie, but to disclose his offence, which liueth with me in perfect amitie, in whose companie hetherto hath ben all my ioy, pleasure and delight: but since his pretence is greatlye preiudiciall to your graces person, I thought to preferre your profite before mine owne pleasure, and the commoditie of my countrie before mine owne priuate contentation. So it is that Gwydonius , whome your grace hath honoured, and all the Court esteemed, is sonne and heire to Clerophontes , the Duke of Metelyne , who by the peeuish pollicie of his Father, vnder the pretence of seruice, is purposed to procure your fatall death, and the finall destruction of your Dukedome. And the better to performe this diuellish practise, hee hath contracted himselfe to my Ladie Castania , who blinded with his beautie, and inueagled with his wit, hath consented, not onely to keepe his counsaile to your confusion, but also closely to conuey her selfe with him into his Countrie. Which pretence if your grace doth not speedely preuent, you shall finde that delaie breedes daunger,  & that procrastination in perils is but the mother of mishap. And haue I (quoth Orlanio ) brought vp the Birde that will picke out mine owne eyes? Haue I fostered vp the Serpent in my bosome that will breede my bane? Haue I giuen her lyfe that seekes to yeelde me death? Haue I cherisht her beeing younge, and wyll shee consume me being older: was there none to choose but Gwydonius , nor none to loue but the son of her fathers foe? Will she preferre her lust before my life, her priuate pleasure, before the safetie of my person? Well, as she forgets the dutie of a child, so I will forget the natural affection of a Father, and therefore Valericus , goe speedely with these noble men to Gwydonius chamber, and apprehend him, that I may requite his hatefull trecherie with most hellish torments. And Thersandro , see you that Castania be closely kept vntill we haue caught the traytour, least she vnderstanding that their deuise is disclosed, she saue her selfe by flight. Valericus hauing this commission giuen him from the Duke, made no delay, but passed to Gwydonius lodging with as much speed as might be: but Fortune who after euery chip of mischaunce, sendeth some lot of good lucke, and after euerie storme of aduersitie, sendeth a quiet calme of prosperitie, so carefully prouided to free Gwydonius from mishap, that he was newlye gone towardes Castania , to impart vnto her this his pretence, but before he came to her chamber, he was incountred by Thersandro , who stearnly taking Gwydonius by the bosome, pulling out his Rapier, commaunded him as a traitour to stand, or else without anye farther doome he shoulde feele the dint of death. Gwydonius amazed with this sodaine motion, stoode as one in a traunce, neither being able to defend himselfe with word or weapon, but yeelded himself into ye hands of Thersandro , who shakt him vp with these bitter speeches. Thou traiterous wretch (quoth he) as it is impossible for the flame so closely to bee couered, but it wyll bee spied, so it is impossible, but that treason, though neuer so secret, should in tract of time bee disclosed, which now by experience is verified in thee, for although thou hast hetherto falsely fained thy selfe to be a straunger of a foraine nation, thou art now knowen to be sonne and heire to Clerophontes that cruell tyraunt my Fathers foe, by whose peeuish pollicy thou hadst not only brought the common wealth to confusion, but didst pretend to be preiudiciall to my fathers person, if thy deadly practise & diuellish purpose had not by Valericus his meanes ben preuented. Hast thou ben so trained vp in trecherie, or is thy minde so spotted with villany, as to repaie my Fathers good wil with such barbarous ingratitude, and to deuise his destruction which simply foresought thy preferment. Yea, to counsel my sister Castania , not onely to consent to thy desire, but to my fathers death? Is this the manner of Metelyne ? or the custome of thy countrie, to be such cosoning counterfaits? Well, since I haue happely attached thee as a traitour, & as a villanous rebell, both transgressing humane and diuine lawes, thou shalt abide the paine & punishment due to such diuellish offenders. Now let thy cruell sire Clerophontes free thee from those torments that thou art like to suffer for thy trecherie, & let the Lords of Metelyne deliuer thee from his hands, who meanes in most miserable wise to martir thee. Yea, let thy Concubine Castania , who is like for her gracelesse disobedience to sippe of the same sorrowe, see if her teares will now preuaile to mooue Orlanio to pittie. No, if Iupiter himselfe sent Mercurie to mittigate his moode, neither the authoritie of the one, nor the eloquence of the other might preuaile to pacifie his furie. secretes disclosed, but that also Valericus most villanously had accused him and Castania of that which they neuer so much as once imagined, was so perplexed, and driuen into such dumpes, as he seemed by silence to auerre that which Thersandro had alleadged, yet at last he began thus to replie. will not denie that which is true, but come dolor, come death, come miserie, come martyrdome, come torture, come torments, I wil neither accuse my selfe iniustly, nor excuse my selfe by periurie. I confesse Thersandro that I am sonne and heire to the Duke of Meteline ,  & contracted to thy sister Castania , that Clerophontes is my father by the lawe of nature, & Castania my wife by the league of loue, but that I either pretended or purposed to be preiudiciall to Orlanios person, or yt Castania was counsailed or euer consented to her Fathers confusion, I not onely denie, but I will proue by combat, that Valericus most villanously doth accuse vs of that whereof we are altogether sacklesse. Why Gwydonius , (quoth he) wilt thou seeke to proue thy self loial, when the hearers deeme thee a lyar, or to make a tryall of thy troth, when thy words can haue no trust? Doest thou thinke my fathers furie will suffer thee to fable? Doest thou thinke his wrathfull rage will abide thy reasons, or that he wil be so patient as to heare thee pleade thine owne cause? No, if thou wert as cleere from these crimes alleadged against thee by Valericus as I am, yet in that thou art sonne to Clerophontes , the coine of Croesus , and kingdomes of Caesar , were not sufficient raunsome to redeeme thee from death. But Gwydonius , since thy health hangeth in my handes, and thy lyfe or death is in my power, I will neither bee so bloudie minded as to breede thy bane, nor so cruell, as to be the cause of thy confusion. The guerdon Gwydonius I craue for this my good will, and the recompence I claime for this curtesie, is: that when thou commest to, Metelyne , thou certifie thy sister and thy loue and Ladie Lcwcippa , that for her sake I haue procured thy safetie, that her perfection hath preserued thee from perill, the loue I beare her hath saued thy lyfe, the duetifull deuotion I owe vnto her, hath redeemed thee from death and daunger. And in token of this my vnfained affection, I will lift my hand against none that commeth from Metelyne , but against Lucianus onely. Before Thersandro was able fullye to vnfolde his minde, or that Gwydonius had time to yeeld him thanks for the sauegard of his lyfe, they hearde a greate noise, which made Gwydonius flie, and Thersandro hie him hastely to Castanias lodging. Nowe the companie which came, was Orlanio himselfe, who certified by Valericus that Gwydonius could not be found, laid not only watch and ward throughout all his Dukedome to attach him, but went in proper person with his Garde to apprehend Castania , and laie her in close prison, whom he found all blubbered with teares, for that she had understoode the cause before of her brother Thersandro: Orlanio no sooner spied her thus weeping, but he raged against her in this wise. Hath the force of loue, nay rather the furie of lust (vild wretch) so blinded thy vnderstanding, that to accomplish it thou passest not to peruert both humane and diuine lawes. Doth lasciuious affection and fleshly fancie so furiously frie within thee, as thou woldest procure thy fathers death to purchase thy diuellish desire? Could no rules of reason, no prick of conscience, no respect of honestie, no feare of God, nor dread of man prohibit thee from pretending such a monstrous mischiefe, as to conclude wt my mortal foe to worke my fatall confusion. The young Storkes so tender the old ones in their age, as they will not suffer the so much as to flie to get their owne liuing. The Bird called Apis Indica , being young, seeing the old ones through age growen so weake, as they are not able to waue their wings, carrie them continually from place to place on their backs: these sauage creatures haue but onely sence, and are obedient, thou hast both reason & sence, & art more vnnatural, these bruite beasts are most dutifull to their parents, and thou a reasonable creature art most disobedient to thy Father: yea, contrarie both to the lawes of Nature and nurture, thou seekest to bath thy handes in his guiltlesse bloude, and without care or conscience to commit most cruell murther, which is so hatefull to all things, as the sencelesse plantes and stones most deadlye detest such villanie. The Oliue tree so hatefully abhorreth a Parracide, that who so beeing guiltie of that crime, attempteth to plant it, dooeth not onely himselfe presently perish, but the tree forthwith wayneth and wythereth. The stone Epistrites so loatheth this offence, counting it a fact so repugnaunt to nature, that it will not vouchsafe to be worne by a murtherer. And shall I then let thee liue who the sencelesse creatures do so deadly loath. No, this had which cherisht thee being a child shall now chastise thee beeing such a cursed caitife. And with that he drew out his Fawlcon redie to haue slaine her. But that Thersandro kneeling down, desired him that he would not so in his furie forget himselfe, as without the sentence of the law put her to death, but to commit her to ward vntill the wars between him & Clerophontes were happely ended, & then vppon more straight examination, if she wer found faultie, to assigne her a punishment due for such an offence. Orlanio somewhat pacified with his sonnes perswasion, commanded that presently she should be carried to prison, and the Ladie Melytta with her, as an actor also in this Tragedie. And that with all speed they should post the countrie for the attaching of the traitor Gwydonius . Who after that he parted from Thersandro , seeing before his eyes the terrour of torments, and the hellish horrour of death, was driuen forward so with the dread of daunger, and feare of imminent perills, that knowing perfectly the coast of the Country, he passed so secretly & speedely, as he was not so much as once descried by the Postes that pursued him, but scaped safelye out of the Dukedome of Alexandria . Beeing now without the dint of the Dukes daunger, seeing that although hee had escaped himselfe, yet he had lefte his Loue and Ladie Castania in hazarde of her life, he began thus to exclaime against his owne folly. Ah Gwydonius (quoth he) what folly hast thou committed by this thy fearefull flight, what carefull calamitie is like to insue of this thy cowardise in auoyding Scylla thou art falne into Charibdis , in preuenting one danger thou art like to be plagued with a thousand discommodities. Had it not bene better for thee to haue died in Alexandria with honor than to lyue heere with shame and reproach, to haue suffered mishap with Castania then to linger heere in miserie? Doost thou thinke that she will euer count of such a prating Parasite, as will loue her in prosperie and leaue her in aduersitie, as preferreth his owne safetie before her securitie, his lyfe before her loue, and draweth himselfe out of daunger to leaue her in distresse? No, she will contempne thee as a coward, more fit to be a mate to some country Ant, than a match for such a courtly Princesse, she will thinke thy greatest faith was but fained sicklenesse, thy forged loue was but filthie lust, thy promises was but periuries, and that thy greatest amitie was but most dissembled enmitie: so that of a professed friend she wil become thy professed foe, her desire will tourne to despite, and her loue to most hellish hate. Why alas, would my paine haue pleased her, would my martirdome haue contented her minde, had my peril procured her profite, or my care her commoditie. Naye, rather would not my daunger haue bene her death, my mishap her miserie, my torture her torments, and my fatall destinie hir small destruction. By sauing my life in time we maye enioye our loue, but by death no hope had bene lefte for obtaining our desire: so that I assure my selfe, Castania will rather allowe of my pollicie by preuenting perilles by flight, than mislyke of my practise in procuring mine owne safetie. And vpon this point I rest, hoping that the Gods seeing how vniustly Valericus hath accused vs, will in tract of time ridde vs from blame and reward him with shame. combred, wt care to see so strange a chaunce and so sodaine a chaunge, that she who of late was a royall Princesse, was now a ruthfull prisoner, that her freedome was tourned to fettars, her dignitie to miserie, and her happie stay to a most hellish state: that after flouds of teares which fell from her Christall eyes, she burst foorth into these tearmes. Alas (quoth she) what poore Damosell was euer driuen into such doubtfull distresse? what Princes was euer perplexed with such dolefull passions? what mayde was euer crossed with such mishap? nay what creature euer was clogged with the like calamitie? Haue the spightfull destinies decreed my destruction, or ye peruerse Planets conspired my bitter bane? Dooth froward fortune meane to make me a mirrour of her mutabilitie, or is this the rewarde that Cupid bestowes vppon hys Clyents? Is euery one that dooth fancie maymed with the like misfortune, or is loue alwayes accopanied with such haplesse lucke? Alas no, for their loue is lawfull,  & mine leawd and lasciuious: their fancie is fixed vppon vertue, and mine vpon vanitie, they make their matche with consent of their parents, and I my market without my fathers counsaile: so that I am like in choosing such chaffre, to chop and chaunge and liue by the losse: yea, to buye repentance at an vnreasonable rate. Had it not bene better for thee Castania , to haue condiscended to the requests of Valericus , then consented to the sute of Gwydonius : to haue liked thine owne countrey-man, than loued a straggeling straunger: to haue satisfied thy selfe with assuraunce, than vainely to fish for hope? Truth, but what then? can the strawe resist the vertue of the pure Iet? can the flaxe resist the force of the fire? can a louer withstand the brunt of beautie? freeze, if he stande by the flame: peruert the lawes of nature, or eschew that which is framed by the fates, or flye from the force of fancie? No, for who so escapeth the deadlye dartes of Cupid , shall be scorched with his fire, and shee that with the deaw of chastitie quencheth this flame, shall be ouer-taken with his wings: so that to seeke by flight to eschewe affection, is foolishly to enterprise that which can neuer be atchieued. But alas, if I must needes lende a listening eare to the allurements of loue, was there none to like but thy Fathers foe? How fonde foole couldest thou shew him courtesie, that intendes to repaye thee with crueltie? Howe couldest thou choose the sonne to thy mate, when the father seekes thy miserie? It is not possible to mixe the bloud of a Bull and a Beare together in one vessel. The Lyons whelpes wil neuer copanie with the young Wolues: the Fawlchons called Pelagrae will neuer fly with the young Lauaretes, and if the egges of a Crowe and a Curlewe bee put in one neaste, they both foorthwith burst in sunder, because there is suche auncient enmitie betweene the olde ones. And wilt thou then be so wilfull to loue him whome thy Father dooth loath, or so peruerse as to place thy selfe in that Parentage, where there is such mortall hatred betweene ye Parents? wilt thou so farre forget the duetie of a childe, as more to respect thy fatall enemie, than regard thy naturall father? But why vilde wretche doo I thus fondely fable, though Clerophontes be my fathers foe, yet Gwydonius is my faithfull friende: though the one seeke to procure my paine, the other seekes to purchase my pleasure: though the olde sire striues to subuert my fathers state, yet the sonne neuer sought to be preiudicall to his person: although that periured parasite Valericus hath most vniustly accused him of treacherie. Shall I then hate him who hath alwaies honoured me? shall I work his woe that wisheth my weale? shal I be his bane, who hath bred my blisse? shall I detest him, which serueth me with most deepe deuotion? No, I heere heartely powre out most pitifull plaints to the Gods to preserue my Gwydonius from perill, and that Fortune may so fauor him as he may passe out of Alexandria without death or danger. What though I heere in prison pine in pain, what though I sinke in sorrowe, what though I be distressed with griefe, and oppressed with miserie, what though I be crossed with care, and combred with calamitie? Tush, let my Father fret and fume in his furie, let my brother rage and rayle, let that traitor Valericus triumph, and all the Countrey most bitterly curse me: yea, let them martir me most miserablye, let them torment me most terribly, yet direful death shall not feare me, as long as I know Gwydonius is deuoyde of daunger. For I hope though fortune frowne, though the destinies denie it, though ye fates forsweare it, yea though the Gods themselues say no, yet in time we shall haue such happie successe, as the loyaltie of our loue, and the cleerenesse of our conscience by the lawe of Iustice doo deserue. And therefore Gwydonius shall be the Planet whereby to direct my dooings, he shall be the starre shal guide my compasse, he shall be the hauen to harbor in, & the Saint at whose shrine I meane to offer my deuotion. Castania hauing thus discoursed with her selfe, shee determined when the warres were ended, if she coulde haue no hope to enioy the loue of Gwydonius , to confesse her faults, and to sue for mercie at the barre of her Fathers curtesie, not that she meant to liue without Gwydonius , or to loue or like anye other, but to prolong her dayes in dolour, that she might most rigorously reuenge the villanie of Valericus , and by bathing in his bloude she might both satisfie her selfe and signifie to Gwydonius how intirely she loued and lyked him. But leauing her perplexed with these passions, againe to Clerophontes . Who frying still in his franticke furie, was not any whit perswaded to conclude peace with Orlanio , but hauing mustred his men, as speedely as might be, imbarkt them, and with a luckie gale arriued at the coast of Alexandria , wher the borderers not able to abide his force, were constrained to saue themselues by flight. But hee as a man hauing exiled from his heart both pietie and pitie, bathed his hands in guiltlesse bloud fiering euery fort, battering downe euery bulwarke, sacking each Citie, racing downe the walles to the grounde, and commaunding his souldiours vpon paine of most greeuous punishment, not to haue any respect of persons, neyther to regarde the hoarie haires of the aged Citizens, nor the tender yeares of the sucking Infants, but to imbrue their blades with the bloud of all men, of what degree soeuer. Orlanio hearing how Clerophontes had inuaded hys dominions, and with what barbarous crueltie hee hadde murthered his subiects, hauing also intelligence by his Scowtes, that his armie was passing huge, the better to resist the furious force of his enimie, hyred out of other Countreyes, a great multitude of Mercenarie Souldiours, so that he gathered a meruailous great hoast, wher in was an infinit number indued with great skill, and long experience. Furnished thus sufficiently both with men and munition like a wise and warie Captaine, seeing that he no waye els might resist the puissaunt power of so mightie a Prince, determined without further delaye to meete him and to giue him present battaile, hauing meruailous affiaunce in the approoued manhoode & vertue of his Souldiours. Clerophontes likewise being of such a valiaunt and inuincible courage, as he seemed from his infancie to bee vowed to Mars and martiall affaires, manfully marched forward to meete with his enimies, which he performed so speedely, that within few dayes, both the Armies wer within viewe, which Clerophontes seeing, he began to incourage his souldiours on this sort. Although most trustie subiects (quoth he) I neither doubt of your prowesse, nor haue cause to feare your manhoode, as hauing mine Armie fraught with the most couragious Captaines, and boldest blouds of Metelyne , yet I wish you to consider how desperately we haue aduentured vpon the Conquest of this Dukedome, which if we atchieue, we shal not onely gaine perpetual fame and renowme, but reap such riches and treasure, as shall sufficiently counteruaile our trauaile. But to obtaine this victorie we must behaue our selues valiantly, neither dreading any daunger though neuer so desperate, nor doubting any perill though neuer so fearefull. Before our face we haue our enimies, behinde our backes the surging seas, so that fight we must, but flye we cannot: in being couragious we winne the fielde, and returne conquerours: in proouing cowards, we both loose our liues and the conquest: if we foyle our foes we returne with triumph, if we faint and flye we haue no hope of safetie, but death and desperation is imminent. Be then hardie to hazard, and valiaunt to venture amiddest the prease of your enimies, that daunted with your valour they may be forced to flye, and we both triumph and inioy the treasure. the other side seeing his men began to feare the force of the enimie, and were amazed with such a monstrous multitude, prickt them forward with this Parle . That mightie Monarch Alexader ye great, who for his martiall exployts, was a mirror to all his posteritie, whose prowesse was such as he daunted Darius , & by his inuincible courage made a conquest of the whole world: hearing on a time one of his Captaines to demaunde what multitude was in their enimies campe, aunswered, that it was not the point of a good soldier to inquire how many the enimies were, but wher they were, meaning that to feare the multitude is rather the signe of cowardise, then a toke of courage. Which saying I wish you carefully to consider, yt the huge army of Clerophontes neither amaze your minds, nor abate your valor, sith yt the equitie of our cause doth more the counteruaile his companie. He inuadeth our realme without reason, & we defend but our owne right: he cruelly seeketh to depriue vs of freedo, & we lawfully do maintain our own liberty. He tirannously striueth to make vs bondslaues, and we fight to free our selues from captiuitie. If he preuayle let vs looke for no pittie, but that we shall be murdered without mercie, we shall see before our face our wiues rauished, our daughters defloured, our parents put to death, our children slaine, our goods spoyled, our Citie sacked, and our selues brought to vtter ruth and ruyne. Sith then we are placed betweene two extremities, eito possesse our owne with plentie, or to passe our liues in penurie: let vs valiauntly venter whatsoeuer wee gaine, let vs fight without feare: for better it is to die with honour, than to liue with shame. By that time Orlanio had ended his Oration, the Armies met in a Plaine, within thirtie leagues of Alexandria . Where both of them ordering (as became good Captaines) their people, there began in the breake of the day, the most cruell and terrible battaile that earst was heard of, considering the number on both partes, theyr experience and pollicie, with the valiant prowesse and courage of the Captaines. Thus continued they in fight, euen almost vntill eeuen, with meruaylous slaughter on both sides, the victorie yet doubtfull, till in the ende the Alexandrians began to faint and flye, more oppressed with the excesse of the multitude, than distressed for want of manhoode, for there were two and fortie thousand slaine, but not one taken prisoner, and of Clerophontes companie eight and twentie thousand slain, and sixe hundred mortally wounded. This monstrous massacre and fearefull slaughter, so amazed the mindes of these two Captaines, that for the better burying of the dead, and healing of them which were hurte, they concluded a truce betweene them for fifteene dayes, in which time Orlanio sent Ambassadors to parle of peace wt Clerophontes , but in vaine: for he was resolued either valiantly to die in the field with glorie, or to inioye the Dukedome of Alexandria with renowme. Yet as a worthie Prince, preferring the securitie of his soldiers before the safetie of his owne person, he offered them the combat, which Orlanio to auoide the effusion of bloud, most willingly accepted. Nowe it was agreed and concluded betweene the, that two champions might be chosen, who by the dint of the swoord should stint the strife betweene these two armies. If he of Metelyne remained victor, then Orlanio shuld not onely paie his former tribute, but deliuer vp his Dukedome into the hands of Clerophontes . But if ye Alexandrians obtained ye conquest, ye Duke of Metelyne should peaceably depart the countrie, release the tribute, and also resigne his state, and become a subiect to Orlanio . And for the better keeping & confirming of these conditions, they presentlye dispatcht Embassadours to Fernandus the king of Bohemia , to intreate his maiestie that he would vouchsafe to become iudge in the combat, who for that he wished wel to both these dukes, graunted to their requests, and with as much speede as might be, came to Alexandria . But in the meane time there was some difference aboute the champions. For Clerophontes sayd, that sith in loosing the field, consisted the losse of liuing, life, and libertie, and in getting ye victorie, the gaine of a Dukedome, he would in proper person fight the combat and trie the chance of Fortune, and therefore made a challenge to Orlanio . But he finding himselfe farre vnfit to resist his furious force, refused it. Yet promising, that none vnlesse he were descended of Nobilitie should enter the lists, wherwith Clerophontes was verie well contented. Nowe while this truce continued, which was prolonged for thirtie dayes, it was lawfull for them of Alexandria to come and viewe the campe of Metelyne , and for the Metelynes to goe and see the Citie. Wherevpon Clerophontes desirous to see Orlanio and his Court, went onelye accompanied with his garde to Alexandria , where he was most royally entertained, and sumptuously feasted by Orlanio , both of them remitting the rigour of their mallice, till it shoulde bee shewed in effect, by reason of their manhood. But as soone as Thersandro and the other Lords saw Clerophontes , yt he was rather a monster then a man, hauing each lim so strongly couched, each part so proportioned, so huge of stature, & so fierce of countenance, they were so dauted with the sight of his perso, as they almost feared to come in his presence, saying: that thereof the boldest blouds in Alexandria were not able to abide the force of Clerophontes . Who now peaceably departing to his hoast, lefte Orlanio as greatly perplexed for assebling his nobilitie together, amongst whom he appointed the champion shuld be chosen. They not onely with one consent withstood his comaund, but began to murmure and mutine against him, condempning him of folly that he would so vnaduisedly commit his own state, & ther stay to the doubtful hazard of one mans hap. Orlanio seeing yt it was now no time to chastise this their presumption, vnlesse he meant to raise ciuill dissention in the citie, which were the next way to confirme the enimie, & breed his owne confusion, he dissebled his cholar & began to work a new way. For first he freed Castania out of prison, the made generall proclamation throughout his Dukedome, yt what Lord so euer wtin his land would try the combat with Clerophontes , if he remained victor in the conquest, he would not onely giue him his daughter Castania to wife, let him possesse peaceably the Dukedome of Metelyne as her dowry, but be content to acknowledge him as his liege, & paye him tribute, as he was wont to Clerophontes . While he lingered and listened how this proclamition would preuaile, Castania hearing this seuere sentence & dolefull doome pronounced, seeing that shoulde not onely be forced to forsake Gwydonius , but be constrained to match in marriage with one whome shee should neyther loue nor like, burst forth into these bitter complaintes. Aalasse (quoth she) how pinching a pain it is to be perplexed with diuers passions, what a noisome care it is to be combred with sundrie cogitations, what a woo it is to hang betweene desire & despaire, & what a hell it is to houer betweene feare and hope. For as to him which is assured to die, death is no dolour, in that he perfectlye knowes there is no salue can cure his sorrow, so to him which feares to die, & yet hopes to liue, death were thrice more welcome, then to linger in such doubt. In which cursed case alas my case consisteth, for as out of the riuer Cea in Sicillia bursteth most feareful flames, and yet the streame is passing colde, neither is the water able to quench the fire, nor the fire cause the water to bee hotte, so the heate of hope flameth out of the chilling fountaine of feare, & yet the force of the one is not able to asswage the vehemencie of the other, but still my heauie heart is diuersly assailed with them both. If my Father Orlanio winne the conquest, I doubt my desire shall neuer haue happie successe, if Clerophontes triumphe as victour, I greatly feare his crueltie is such, as I shall not escape most haplesse death. And yet againe I hope that then my own Gwydonius wil accept me for his, and with triumphant armes imbrace me. But alas, will Clerophontes suffer him to match with his mortal fo, wil he not rather preuent it by my peril? Yes no doubt, if he returne with triumph, my Father shal serue him as a subiect, my brother shall become his vassall, my friendes shall bee forlorne, my Citie sackt, and my natiue Countrie brought to vtter confusion. And shall I for the loue of a straunger wishe these straunge stratagemmes? Shall I to feede mine owne fancie, and content my lustinge minde, wish my Fathers death, my Brothers bane, my friends mishap, my Countries confusion, and perhappes my owne miserie. For though Gwydonius loued mee when our parents were friendes, he will not now lyke me beeing foes: but to reuenge the iniuries my Father offered him, will subtilly seeke to sacke my honour and honestie, and so triumph of my shame and discredit. Had I not better praie my Father may winne the combat, & then shall I bath in the streames of blisse, and flowe in the flouds of felicitie, then shall I dread no daunger, no feare, no perills: then shall I see my father, friendes, and Countrie, flourish in most happie prosperitie: then shall I inioy some iolly Gentleman, who will loue me beeing young, and cherish me being olde, and possesse the Dukedome of Metelyne for my dowrie. And canst thou Castania be so ingratefull, as to will his woe which wisheth thy weale, to desire his destruction which prayeth for thy prosperitie? canst thou be so couetous as to craue that for thy possession, which is thy Gwydonius patrimonie, or so suspitious as to accuse him of trecherie, which hath bene but to trustie: to count him a counterfaite, which hath alwaies bene constant? No, come what come will, let froward fortune fauour whome she please, so I may ioy and safely inioy my onely ioy Gwydonius . As Castania had thus ended her complaint, Gwydonius who all this while lurked about the borders of Alexandria , heard what successe Orlanios affaires had with his Father Clerophontes , how verie fewe or none at all durst trie the combat with him, that his loue and Ladie Castania was the prise that he should get that gained the conquest. Which things considered, supposing yt Castania had cast him off, & that she plaid, out of sight out of mind, by a secret and trustie messenger, he presented her with this Letter. The pure spice Castania the more it is pounded, the sweeter smell it yeelds, the Camomill increaseth most beeing troden on, the Palme tree the greater waight it beareth, the straighter it groweth, the stone Terpistetres the more it is beaten the harder it is, and loyall loue is not weakened by the stormes of aduersitie, but rather far the more fortified by the froward state of frowning fortune: which Madame I speake by proofe and experience, for since I haue sipped of the sower dregs of sorrow, and bene pestered with the bitter pills of penurie, since sinister fortune hath crossed me with mishaps, and disaster fates haue driuen me downe to miserie, my fancie hath so furiously assaulted my minde, and affection hath so incessantly battered the bulwarke of my brest, as ye sparks of loue which were kindled in me in prosperitie, are turned to fierce and firie flames by aduersitie. So that madame, your presence did not before procure me such pleasure, as your absence doth paine, neither was I so drowned in delight in frequenting your companie, as I am drenched with despight by leading my life in sorrowfull calamitie. Alasse Castania what vnspeakeable griefe hath tormented mee? what direfull dolour hath distressed me? what hellish horrour hath hunted me? yea, what woe and wretchednesse hath wracked my wittes, since thou hast beene proclaymed a praie to him whosoeuer winneth the prise in the combat. Howe ofte haue I wished that I might bee the champion to make the challenge, that I might venture my lyfe to purchase thy lybertie, that my death might redeeme thee from daunger. But alasse, I see to wishe is in vaine, to to craue of the Gods, that thy Father shoulde vaunt of the victorie, is but to wish that your loue shoulde haue haplesse successe: to praie that Clerophontes should returne with conquest, thou wilt deeme I desire thy friends misfortune, thus assailed with diuerse doubtes, I driue off my dayes in dolour: hoping howsoeuer fortune froune, that the fates wil assigne vs a perfect calme of permanent felicitie, for this sturdie storme of pinching miserie. Thine euer, exiled Gwydonius. fortune was able to change ye fixed fancie of Gwydonius , conceiued such assured hope in his constancie, as now she thought his troth was filed with no spot of trecherie, that his faith was quite deuoide of flatterie, and that whatsoeuer chaunced, she might safely repose her staie and state in his loyaltie. Insomuch that to driue out the euill opinion which she thought her brother Thersandro had conceiued of Gwydonius conspiracie, shee secretly shewed him the Letter, which after he had read ouer and carefully construed euerie clause, hee began both to detect and detest the villanie of Valericus , desiring his sister Castania that she would earnestly perswade Gwydonius in disguised apparell speedelye to repaire to her lodging, promising with solempne vowes and sacred oaths, not to bee preiudiciall to his person: Castania affying greatly in her brothers faith, and desirous to haue a sight of her louing Gwydonius , returned him these fewe lines. Who so tasteth Gwidonius of the hearbe Mely, Sophilos is neuer tormented with the sting of aduersitie, and she that weareth the stone Mephites aboute her, neuer soroweth at sinister fortune, who so fancieth without faining neuer proueth fickle, and she that loueth loyally may well be crossed with calamitie, but neuer iustly accused of inconstancie. Account thy Castania good Gwydonius to be in the same predicament, for let disaster mishap driue me downe to most deadlye miserie, let the cruell fates compasse me with cursed care, let fortune and the destinies conclude my confusion, yet it shall not diminish my fancie, but rather increase my affection. I will stil in weale, in woe, in bale, in blisse, in mirth & miserie, say I loue, and it is onely Gwydonius . For shall our fancie bee such as it shal be foiled with misfortune: no, but as Thetis chaunging into many shapes, at last returned into her owne forme, so into what mishap I be driuen by misery, yet I will stand in mine olde state in despight of ye fates and fortune. Come therefore Gwydonius to the court in disguised apparell, but without care, for thou shalt finde me so trustie, as my troth shall be without spotte, & thy health without hazard. Thus wishing thy curtesie to conster well of my constancie, I bid thee farewell. Thine or not her owne, constant Castania. letter, although ye rigor of Orlanio might haue giue him sufficient cause of suspitio, yet ye cleerenes of his own conscience  & the loue he bare to Castania , wold not suffer him eyther to suspect anie treason, or to doubt of anie deceit, but determined without any delay to put the saftie of his person and the sauegard of his life into her handes. But leauing him to bring his purpose luckely to passe, againe to Orlanio . Who seeing that his proclamation could not preuaile, and that his nobles preferred their owne safetie before his securitie, was perplexed with such hellish passions, and griped with such pinching griefe, as the Ghoasts tormented with grisly fiends felt no such haplesse furie. To fight with Clerophontes , he felt his strength farre vnfit to resist his force, to denie the combat hee neither coulde nor wold, although he brought himselfe to confusion, and his children to captiuitie, so that howsoeuer he tourned himselfe, he sawe before his face death and dispaire, woe and wretchednesse, mishap and miserie. Combred thus with this curelesse care, and sitting solitarily in sorrow, seeing the dismal day drew on, and hearing that Fernandus the king of Bohemia was lately landed, he fell into more furious passions, vntill he was driuen out of his dumps by his sonne Thersandro , who perceiuing his father thus dolefully daunted, he began most louingly to comfort him, promising that since none durst venture to deale with Clerophontes , he himselfe would fight ye combat, and either worthelye winne the conquest with renowme, or manfully die in the field with honour. Orlanio hearing the bold courage of this new champion, felt his sorrow somewhat salued by this proffer, perswading himselfe yt his sonne was better able to abide ye brunt then he, & hoping that the Gods would fauour the equitie of the cause, and assuredly by iustice graunt him the victorie. Resting I saie vppon this hope, and thanking Thersandro for his naturall affection, and praysing him for his noble courage, hee presentlye went to meete Fernandus , whom he most princely entertained, conducting him very royally into Alexandria , where hee most sumptuously feasted him and all his traine. But as they passed away the time in pastime and pleasure, so poore Thersandro spent the daye in dolour and the night in sorrowe. For although to comfort his Father he made light of the combat, and valiauntly offered himselfe to trie the chaunce of Fortune, yet seeing his enimies force farre to exceede his feeble strength, he began to faint, although like a worthie Gentleman he couered his dreadfull courage with a desperate countenaunce, raunging vp and downe the fieldes to driue awaye his melancholy, where by chaunce in disguised apparaile he met Gwydonius , to whom after some Parle past between them, he bewrayed the whole state of the matter, howe he was to enter combat with Clerophontes , and that hee doubted greatly of the euent of the victorie, fearing the force of his Father, and fainting at his owne imbecilitie. Which Gwydonius hearing he made this short aunswere. when delay breedes daunger,  & folly to hope for faire weather when the aire is ouercast with clowdes: leauing off therefore all oathes to confirme my faith, thus much to the purpose. If it please thee to trust me without triall, and to giue anye confidence to my words, I heere promise both to make manifest my loyall loue to Castania , and to repay thy courtesie, that I will, resembling thy person, and disguised in thy armor, enter combat with my father Clerophontes , either intending by winning the victorie to obtaine my will, or by loosing the conquest to want my wish: if this my proffer please thee, I will passe priuilie to ye Court, if not good Thersandro , let me goe as I came. Thersandro commending the subtill deuise of Gwydonius caried him as couertly as could be to Castania , to whom he was farre more welcome than soone come, remaining closely in her closet till ye next morning. Castania notwithstanding knowing nothing of their pretece. Fernandus King of Bohemia the nexte daye being gone with all his nobilite to the place appointed for the combat. Orlanio, Castania , and all the Lords of Alexandria , clad in mourning attire folowed him, thinking this dismall day should be the date of their destruction. And Clerophontes as a baleful wretch thirsting after bloud, and glorying in the hope of his supposed conquest, stoode in the lystes expecting his fatall foe. To whome Gwydonius his sonne furnished with the armour of Thersandro , presented himselfe. Who seeing, that forced by the fond allurements of loue, he was to fight, not wyth his mortal foe, but with his natural father, he fell into these doubtfull dumpes. Alas poore Gwydonius (quoth he) how art thou combred with diuers cogitations, what a cruell conflict dost thou finde in thy minde betweene loue and loyaltie, nature & necessitie? who euer was so wilfull, as willingly to wage battaile against his owne father? who so cruell as to enter combat with his owne sire? Alas, duetie perswades me not to practise so monstrous a mischiefe: but the deuotion I owe to Castania driues me to perfourme the deede, were it thrice more daungerous or desperate. The honour I owe to my Father makes me faynt for feare, but once to imagine so brutish a fact: the loue I owe to Castania constrayneth me to defende the combat if Iupiter himselfe made the challenge. And is not (fond foole necessitie aboue nature, is not the lawe of loue aboue King or Keyzar, Father or Friends, God or the Diuell? Yes. And so I meane to take it: for either I wil valiantly win the conquest and my Castania , or lose the victorie, and so by death ende my miseries. With that the trumpets sounded, and Gwydonius lustely leaping into the lystes, fell presentlye into furyous fight with his father, driuing not onely Fernandus & Orlanio , but also both the armies into a great doubt, for although Clerophontes most cruelly prosecuted him, yet he alwaies receiued the strokes, but neuer so much as once returned one blow, till at last looking aloft, and spying Castania , his courage so increased, that all feare set aside, he carelessely flang away his sword and shield and ranne vpon his Father, not onely tearing from him his target, but vyolently casting him vpon the ground, and speedely vnlacing his Helmet, offered to cut off his head with his owne sword; but Clerophontes crying out confessed himselfe captiue, and granted his enimie the conquest. Wherevpon they of Alexandria , gaue a mightie showte, and Fernandus and Orlanio came down readie to carrie Clerophontes captiue to the Citie. But Gwydonius first demaunded of Orlanio if hee was content to perfourme that which he promised by proclamation, to whom Fernandus aunswered that both he would and should or els as he was his friend so he woulde bee his foe. Gwydonius hearing this faithfull assertion of the King, pulling downe his beauer, began to speake in this manner. I let thee Orlanio (quoth he) and the worthie king of Bohemia to knowe, that I am Gwydonius , sonne and heire to this conquered Clerophontes , who for the loue of thy Daughter Castania haue not spared contrarie to the lawe of nature, to fight with mine owne Father, hoping the destinies by my meanes haue decreed, not onely of fatall foes to make you faithfull friendes, but to finish vp our loue, which otherwise coulde not haue bene perfourmed. I haue wonne Orlanio my Fathers Dukedome by victorie, and thy Daughter by conquest, the one I had before by inheritaunce and the other by loue, yet I wold willingly haue thy good will, which if thou graunt, I hope my father will both pardon my offence and thinke well of my proffer. Clerophontes kissing and imbracing Gwydonius , tolde him his care was halfe cured, in that such a good Captaine had wonne the Conquest. Fernandus & Orlanio stood astonished at this strange Tragedie, doubting in whether they dreampt of such a rare deuice, or saw it effect. At last Orlanio as one wakened out of a traunce, with trickeling teares imbraced Clerophontes , honouring him as his Soueraigne, and promising not onely to giue Castania to Gwydonius , but also halfe his Dukedome in dowrie. Clerophontes thanking him for his curtesie, consented most willingly to this motion, so that before Fernandus departed, the marriage between Gwydonius and Castania, Thersandro and Lewcippa , was most sumptuously solemnized. FINIS. Robert Greene, Master of Artes. be present. Loue and Folly arriue at one Instant at the gate of the Pallace, which was shut, hauing nothing open but the wicket. Folly seeing Loue readie to enter in, passeth before, which repulse driueth Loue into choller. Folly auoucheth that of right shee ought to bee the formost. Wherevpon they enter into disputation of their power, dignitie and superioritie. But Loue not able to get the coquest by words, taketh his bowe in hand and shooteth at her, but in vaine, for Folly became inuisible, and in despight pulleth out Cupids eyes. And for to couer this deformitie, shadoweth his face with a vayle, so framed by the Destinies, that it was not possible to take it awaye. Venus complaineth of Folly vnto Iupiter, who appointeth Appollo and Mercurie to plead the case of these two Clients, whose discourse beeing heard, hee pronounceth his sentence. I feare greatly that I shall be the last at the Feast of Iupiter , where all the Gods no doubt doo attend mee And yet me think I see the Sonne of Venus which is as late, as I. I will passe before him, least they call me sluggish and sloathfull. What foole is this that repulseth me so rudely? take heede least hast make wast, and that thy rashnesse cause thee not cry Peccaui . Oh sir, blame me not though I make hast, for I goe before to tell the Gods, that you come at leasure. Nay, that which is easely begun, is not alwaies lightly ended: for before thou escape me, I will reuenge this thy iniurious iesting. Let me goe fond Loue and stay me not, for as it is a shame to quarrell with a woman, so it is more discredit to take the foyle. The foyle. What boasting brags be these? who hath euer aduentured to despise mee, much lesse to defie mee? But doost thou know what I am. Thou art Cupid the Sonne of Venus . How darest thou then vaunt thy selfe against mee, which how little so euer I be, am the most redoubted of all the Gods. Thy words are great whatsoeuer thy workes be, but tell me, what or wherein lyeth this thy great power. The heauens and the earth fonde foole are witnesses of my words, there is no place where I haue not lefte Trophees in signe of triumph. Looke into heauen, and demaund if any of the Gods haue escaped my handes? Begin with olde Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Apollo , and end with the Demigods, Satyres, Fawnes, and Siluanes: Nay, the Goddesses themselues will not shame to confesse somewhat. Looke vpon the earth, and see if thou canst find one, which hath not ben foyled by my means. Behold in the furious Seas, how Neptune and his Tritons doo yeelde me obeysaunce. Yea, and lastly looke into Hell it selfe, if I haue not forced Pluto that infernall Prince, to steale awaye Proserpina the daughter of Ceres . And to the ende, thou doubt not with what engines I haue atchieued these victories, behold this Bowe and these Arrowes onely, which haue wonne mee these worthie Conquests. I haue no neede that Vulcan doo temper my tooles. I am not accompanied with the Furyes and Harpies, to cause me to be feared before the Combat. I haue not to doo with Charyots, Souldiours, Captaines, men of armes, nor great troupes of Horsemen, without the which mortall men cannot triumph. No, I haue no other counsaile, munition, nor ayde, but my selfe. When I see mine enimyes in the Fielde, I present my selfe with my Bowe, and lette flye my Boltes, and the victorye is alwayes gotten at the first stroke. I excuse thy youthfull yeares poore Cupid , or else I woulde blaze thee for the most presumptuous patche in the worlde. It seemeth by the vaine vaunting that euerye one holdeth his lyfe of thy mercie, and that thou art the onelye Lorde and Soueraygne both in Heauen, Earth, the Sea, and Hell. But manie things are spoken which are neuer beleeued. And art thou so hard of beleefe, to denie that which euery one confesseth. I haue not to doo with other mens opinions: but this I am sure, that it is not by thy force and prowesse, that so many myracles are wrought in the worlde, but by my industrie, by my meanes, and by my diligence, although thou knowest me not. But if thou doost continue long in this thy choller, I will let thee vnderstand that thy bowe and thy arrowes whereof thou vauntest so much, are more weake than waxe, if I bende not the one, and temper the other. Doost thou thinke by this scoffing to pacifie myne anger, or by contemptuous threatening to quallyfie my choller. Hast thou euer (fonde foole) handled my bowe, or directed my boltes? Is it thy prowesse and not my force which perfourmeth such valyaunt Conquestes? But since thou regardest me and respectest my force so little, thou shalt presently feele the proofe thereof. But where art thou become? How hast thou escaped me? This onely is the straungest case that euer chaunced vnto me. I had thought that amongst all the Gods I onely could haue made my selfe inuisible. But now I see I am deceiued. Did not I tell thee before, that thy bowe and thy arrowes are of no force, but when it pleaseth me, and that by my meanes thou alwayes obtainest the conquest. Meruaile not if I be inuisible, for if I list the eyes of the Eagle or of the Serpent of Epidawrus , cannot espie me, for Camelion like I take the shape of them with whom I doe remaine. Truely as I coniecture thou art some Sorceresse, or some Inchauntresse, some Circe , some Medea , or some Fayrie. Well, since thou doest thus recklesly raile vpon mee, know that I am a goddesse as thou art a God, my name is folly: I am she which raiseth thee vp, and casteth thee downe at my pleasure. Thou vnloosest thy bowe, and lettest flie thine arrowes in the aire, but I place them where it pleaseth me. Thou doest addresse thy selfe against Iupiter , but he is of such puissaunce, that if I both guide dnot thy hand, and tempered thy arrow, thy feeble force could little preuaile against his prowesse. Indeede yu didst force Iupiter to loue, but I caused him to change himselfe into a Swanne, into a Bull, into Golde, into an Eagle. Who caused Mars and thy mother Venus to bee taken in bed together by the limping cuckolde Vulcan , but I? If Paris had done no other thing but loued Helena, Sparta had neuer reioyced, nor Troy ben brought to ruine. But did not I cause him to goe to Menelaus vnder coulour of Embassage, to Court vnto his wife to leade her awaie by force, and after to defend his vniust quarrel against all Greece ? Who had spoken of the loue of Dido , if he had not deuised to goe a hunting, that she might haue the better commoditie to communicate with Aeneas , that by such priuate familiaritie he might not be ashamed to take from her that which long before most willingly she would haue giuen him. I beleeue no mention had beene made of Artemizia , if I had not caused her drinke the cynders of her husbands dead carcasse, for else who had knowen whether she had loued her husband more then other women. The effect and issues of things alwayes make them to be praised or dispraised. If thou makest men to loue, yet I am oft times the chiefest cause. But if any straunge aduenture or greate effect chaunceth, in that thou hast no part, but the onely honour belongeth vnto me. Thou rulest nothing but ye heart, the rest I gouerne: yea, I leade thee, I conducte thee, and thine eyes serue thee to no more vse then the beames of the Sunne to a blinde man. But to the ende thou knowe mee from hence foorth, and that thou mayst giue mee thankes for conducting thee carefullye: Beholde nowe howe greatlye thine eyes dooe profite thee. Alasse Iupiter , O my mother Venus , what auayleth it to bee thy sonne so feared, so redoubted, both in heauen and in earth, if I be subiect to bee iniured as the most vile slaue in the worlde: Alasse, haue I thus lost mine eies by an vnknowen woman. Take heede fond foole another time to rayle vppon those who perhappes are of more force and puissaunce then thou. Thou hast offended the Queene of men, thou hast outraged her who gouerneth the heart, the braine, and the minde: Under whose shadowe euerie one once in his lyfe shroudeth himselfe, and ther remaineth either long or short time according to his merite, thou hast displeased her who procureth thy renowme, thou hast contempned her who hath aduaunced thee, and therfore hath this misfortune fallen vpon thy head. Alasse, how is it possible for me to honour her whom I neuer knew, or to reuerence that person whom before I neuer sawe: but if thou hast borne me such great good will as thou saist, pardon this my offence, and restore me my sight. To restore thee thine eyes is not in my power, but I will couer the place to hide the deformitie. And in liew of this haplesse lucke, thou shalt haue these wings which shal cary thee whether thou wilt wish But where hadst thou this vaile so readie to couer my deformitie. It was giuen me as I came hether, by one of the destinies, who told me it was of that nature, that if it were once fastned, it could neuer be vnloosed. How vnloosed? am I then blinde for euer? O vile and traiterous wretch, coulde it not suffice to pull out mine eyes, but to take awaie the meanes, that the Gods cannot restore them, now I see the sentence verified on my selfe, that it is not good to take a present at the hande of an enimie. O cruell destinies, O cursed daie: shall not the heauens, the earth, and the seas haue cause to waile, sith loue is blinde. But why doe I complaine heere in vaine, it is better for me to sue to the Gods for reuengement. mischiefe. Alasse in what miserable case am I, what can eyther my bowe or mine arrowes auaile me, nowe can I not cause whom I list to loue, but without respect of persons, euerie one is in daunger of my darts. Hetherto I haue onely caused daintie damsells and young youths to loue, I did choose out the brauest blouds, and the fairest and most well featured men: I did pardon vile and base persons, I excused the deformed creatures, and let olde age remaine in peace. But now thinking to hit a young gallaunt, I light vpon some olde doating lecher: in steed of some braue Gentleman, I strike some filthie foule lurden. And it shall happen (I doubt) that they shall bee most fortunate in their loue, so that by patrimonie, presence, or wealth, they shall soonest winne the fauour of women, and by this meanes my kingdome shall come to ruine, when men see in it such disorder and euill gouernment. I haue carefully long sought thee my deare sonne, meruailing what the cause shoulde bee that thou hast not bene present at the banket of Iupiter . Who is greatly incensed against thee, not onely for thy absence, but for the complaintes which are powred out against thee by sundrie poore artificers, labouring men, pesaunts, slaues, hand maides, olde men, and toothlesse aged women, crying all vnto Iupiter , that they loue, thinking themselues greatly iniured in this respect, that the passion which is proper to worthy and noble men, should be inflicted vpon them which are of the base and vildest sort. Had not the great misfortune which is chaunced vnto me happened, I had neither bene absent from the banquet, nor these greeuous complaints had not bene inferred against mee. Why? and art thou hurt? Who hath thus vailed thine eies. Folly hath not onely pulled them out, but also hath put this bande before mine eies, which can neuer be taken away. O cursed enimie of all wisedome, O haplesse wretch, vniustly called a Goddesse, and more vnrightly tearmed immortall, hast thou depriued me of my chiefest delight and felicitie. O disaster loue, O dissolute mother, O wofull Venus , who seest thy sonne, thy ioy, and onely care, thus cruelly depriued of his sight. Well, since thy mishap is so great, I vowe that euerie one that shall loue (what fauour or happie successe so euer he shall haue) shall not be without some care, trouble, or calamitie, that hee vaunt not himselfe to be more happie then the sonne of Venus . Cease off good mother from these sorrowfull complaints, & redouble not my griefe by these your dolorous discourses, suffer mee to beare mine owne misfortune, and wish not euill vnto them which shall bee my subiectes. Well, let vs then goe to Iupiter , and complaine of this cursed inchauntresse. If euer thou hadst pittie of my plaintes, most iust Iupiter , when thou sawest me labour to saue my son Aeneas from the furie of the raging Seas, and to defend him from other daungers, in the which he was present at the siege of Troy . If my teares for the death of my deare Adonis moued thee to compassion. The surpassing sorrow that I doe conceiue for the great iniurie offered to Cupid , I hope shall moue thee to pittie. If teares wold suffer me I would bewraie the cause of my sorrow, but behold my sonne in what plight he is, and thou shalt easily perceiue the cause of my complaint. Alasse my deare daughter, what doe these teares preuaile, knowest thou not what fatherly affection I haue alwaies borne thee, what doest thou distrust that I wyll not succour thee, or that I cannot. No, I neither doubt the one, nor distrust the other, I onely demaund iustice against Folly , the most outragious furie in the world, which hath thus grieuously abused Cupid . Most mightie and soueraigne Iupiter , beholde I am heere readie to answere to Venus complaints, and to debate my right against Cupid . Folly , I will neither accuse nor excuse thee, vntill I haue heard the defence of the one, as well as the plaint of the other, least I should be thought parciall, neither for the more auoiding of iniustice in the matter, wil I suffer you to plead your owne causes, but Venus choose you one of the Gods, and Folly take you an other. I choose Appollo to defend my cause. And I Mercurie to maintaine my right. Then Apollo & Mercurie , prepare your selues to plead well in your clients cases, and Apollo since you take the plaintiefes part, let vs heare what you can say. The common people, right soueraigne Iupiter (although their minds be sotted & almost seceles, yet they haue al way had loue in such sacred estimation, yt they haue carefully rewarded the wt the titles of honor & dignity, which haue excelled in yt holy affection, esteeming this only vertue (if so rightly it may be tearmed) sufficient of a ma to make one a God. The Scithians for this cause canonized Pilades & Orestes , erecting temples vnto the, & calling the the Gods of amitie. Castor & Pollux were made immortal by this meanes, not in yt they were brothers, but in yt (which is rare) their loue was inuiolable. Howe hath fame blazed abroad ye loue of Dauid & Ionathas , ye amitie of Pithias & Damon , & of Titus & Gysippus . But ye better to make manifest ye force of loue & amitie, I will alledge the saying of Darius , who opening a Pomgranat, being demanded wherof he would haue as many as ther were graines within, answered, of Zopyres: this Zopyre was his faithful friend, by the meanes of whom he conquered Babylon . I remember also a certaine Syrian demanding a maide in marriage, and being willed to shew of what wealth he was, said that he had no other riches but two friends, esteeming himself rich inough with such possessions to craue ye daughter of a great lord in mariage. Did not loue cause Ariadne saue Theseus life, Hyperminestra redeeme Linceus fro danger, & Medea free Iason from perill? Haue not many poore soldiers ben aduanced to high dignities by ye meanes of loue? yea, doth not all pleasure & profit proceed to man by loue, causing him to looke wt an amiable countenance, to speake pleasantly, and to be curious in his ieastures, although by nature he be dull, sottish, & of a fierce looke. What causeth a man to go braue & fine in his apparell, seeking euerie day new fashions, but loue? What procureth Gentlewomen to haue their haire frizeled, crisped, and embrodered with golde, to be dressed after the Spanish, French, or Italian fashion, but Loue. Painting their faces if they be foule, with liuely colours. But if they be faire, they so carfully keepe their beautie from the parching heate of Summer, from the chilling colde of Winter, from Wine, raine, and age, as they remaine almost euer young, not so much as forgetting to haue their shooes made fine and neate (because the curiousnesse of men is such, as they leaue not to looke from the crowne of the head to the soale of the foote) to haue their iemmes, iewells, ouches, ringes, perfumed gloues, and what not? In fine, what beautie or brauerie is in the apparell eyther of man or woman, all proceedeth of Loue. Shall I saie that Musicke was onely inuented by loue, yea truely, for eyther it mittigateth the passions wherewith men are perplexed, or else augmenteth their pleasure, so that dayly they inuent diuerse kindes of instrumentes, as Lutes, Citrons, Uiolls, Flutes, Cornets, Bandoras, whereon they plaie Madrigalis, Sonnettes, Pauins, Measures, Galiardes, and all these in remembraunce of Loue, as he for whom men doe more then for anie other. What causeth men to iust, tourney, runne at tilt, and combat, but loue? Who caused Comedies, shews, Tragedies and Masks to be inuented, but Loue. Wherof commeth it that men delight to rehearse their amorous chaunces and straunge passions, and to relate them to their companions: some praising the courtesie of his Ladie, another condempning his mistresse crueltie: yea, recounting a thousande mishappes which happen in theyr loues: as Letters disclosed, euyll reportes, suspitious iealousie, sometimes the husband comming home sooner, than either the louer would, or the wife doeth wish: sometimes coniecturing without cause, and other times beleeuing nothing, but trusting vppon hys wiues honestie. To be short, the greatest pleasure after loue, is to tell what perillous daungers are passed. But what maketh so many Poets in the worlde, is it not Loue? the which seemeth to be the plaine song whereon all Poets doo descant: yea, there is few which write vppon any serious matter, but they close vp their worke with some amorous clause, or els they are the worse accepted. Ouid hath celebrated the fame of Cupid, Petracke and Virgil, Homere and Liuius, Sapho , yea & that seuere Socrates wrote somewhat of his loue Aspasia . Tush, who rightly can denye, that Loue is not the cause of all the glorie, honour, profite and pleasure which happeneth to man, and that without it he cannot conuenientlye lyue, but shall runne into a thousande enormities. All this happie successe came by Loue, as long as hee had his eyes, but now being depriued of his sight, and accompanied with Folly, it is to be feared, nay certainly to be beleeued, that he shall be the cause of as manie discommodities, mischiefes and mishaps, as hethertoo hee hath bene of honour, profit, and pleasure. The noble men which loued their inferiours, and the subiects which dutifully serued their Lords, shall be meruailously chaunged by the meanes of folly, for the master shall loue his seruaunt onely for his seruice, and the seruaunt his master onely for commoditie. Yea, there is none so addicted vnto vertue, but if once he loue, he shall presently commit some foolish touch: and the more straight and firme loue is, the greater disorder there shall be by the meanes of Folly. There will returne into the world more then one Biblis , more then one Semyramis , then one Myrrha , then one Canace , then one Phaedra . There shall be no place in the world vnspotted. The high walls and trellissed windowes, shall not keepe the Nunnes and Uestall Uirgins in sauegard. Olde age shall tourne her aged affections into fond fancies and wanton desires. Shame shall lyue as an exile. There shall be no difference betweene the Noble and the pesaunt, betweene the Infidell and the Moore, the Turke and the Iewe, the Ladie, the Mistresse and the hand-maide. But ther shall insue such a confused inequalitie, that the faire shal not be matched with the wel featured, but shal be oft times ioyned with fowle and deformed persons. Great Ladies and noble Dames shall fall in loue with them whome before they would disdaine to accept as their seruants. And when the loyall and faithfull Louers, haue long languished in the loue of some beautifull Dame, whose mutuall good will they haue gayned by deserte: then Folly will cause some fickle & false flatterer, to enioye that in one hower, which in all their life they coulde not attayne. I passe ouer the continuall debates and quarrells that shall ensue by Folly, whereof shall spring woundes, massacres, and most fearefull murthers. And I greatly feare that wheras Loue hath inuented so many laudable sciences, and brought foorth so many commodities, that now he will bring great idlenesse accompanied with ignoraunce, that he will cause young Gentlemen to leaue feates of armes, to forsake the seruice of their Prince, to reiect honourable studyes, and to appplye them selues to vaine songs and sonnets, to chambring and wantonnesse, to banketting and gluttonie, bringing infinite diseases to their bodies, and sundrie daungers and perills to their persons, for there is no more daungerous companie than of Folly. Behold O souereigne Iupiter the mischiefes and miseries that are like to insue, if Folly be appointed companion to Loue. Wherefore I in the person of all the Gods beseech, your Maiestie to graunt that Loue maye not be ioyned with her, and that Folly may greeuously be punished for the outrage she hath done to Cupid . beginneth to speake in this wise. Whereas (right worthie Iupiter) Apollo hath with his painted eloquence set out the praises of Loue, and hath sought with his filed phrases to discredit Folly, I hope when your Maiestie shall throughlye heare the cause decyded, you will commende his Eloquence, more than his reasons. For it is not vnknowen vnto you and all the Gods, that Folly is no whit inferiour vnto Loue, and that Loue should be of no force without her, neyther could his kingdom indure without her help, ayde and counsayle. I praye you call to remembraunce how Folly incontinently after Man was placed in Paradise, beganne most imperiously to rule, and hath euer since continued in such credite, as neuer any Goddesse had the like, raigning and ruling amongest men, from time to time, from age to age, as the onely Princesse of the worlde. Insomuch that who haue bene more honored than fooles. Who was more subiect vnto Folly, than Alexander the great. which feeling himselfe to suffer hunger and thirst, to be subiect to sorrow and sicknesse, not able to keepe himselfe from dronkennesse, yet would be honoured for a God. What kinde of people hath bene in greater credit than Philosophers, and who more fooles? Did not Aristotle most foolishly dye for sorrowe, because he knewe not the ebbing and flowing of the sea? Did not Crates in casting his treasure into the sea, commit a wise deede? What folly shewed Empedocles , by his straunge coniectures? what say you to Diogenes tunne, and to Aristippus flatterie? Who so throughly considereth their opinions, shal finde them subiect to the state of Folly. How many other sciences are there in the world, which are altogether foolish, and yet the professors of them had in high reputation amongest men. They which are Calculators of Natiuities, makers of charecters, casters of figures, are they not Friers of this fraternitie. Is it not Folly to be so curious, as to measure the heauen, the height of the starres, the breadth of the earth, and the deapth of the sea, and yet the professors heereof are highly esteemed, & onely by the meanes of Folly. Nay, how could ye world continue, if the daungers, troubles, calamities and discommodities of mariage, were not couered by folly. Who would haue coasted the seas if Folly had not ben his guide? to commit himselfe to the mercie of ye winde the waues, to liue in daunger of fearefull surges, and and perillous Rockes, to trafficke with sauage and barbarous people, onely incensed by the meanes of Folly. And yet notwithstanding by this meanes the common wealth is maintained, knowledge and learning augmented, the properties of hearbes, stones, and birdes beastes, perfectly searched out. What Follye is it most daungerously to passe into the bowels of ye earth to dig for yron, and seeke for golde? How many Arts and occupations shuld be driuen out of the world, if Folly were banished? truly the most part of men should either beg for want, or dye for hunger. How should so many Aduocates, Procurators, Sergeaunts, Atturneyes, Scriueners, Imbroderers, Painters, and Perfumers liue, if Lady Folly were vtterlye exiled. Hath not Folly inuented a thousand deuices to drawe a man from idlenesse, as Tragedies, Comedies, Dauncing schooles, Fencing houses, wrastling places, and a thousand other foolish sports. Hath she not made men hardie & venterous to fight with Lyons, Boares & Bulles, onely to gaine honour, & to passe other in folly. What did Antonie and Cleopapatra when they straue who should spend most in beastly banketting? What caused Caesar lament that he had not begun to trouble the world in that age, wherin Alexander had conquered the greatest part? Why did diuers seeke to fill vp the valleyes, to make plaine the mountaines, to drye vp riuers, to make bridges ouer the sea, as Claudius the Emperour did? What made Rhodope build the Pyramides, and Artemisia frame the sumptuous sepulcher? but Folly. In fine, without this Goddesse man should be carefull, heauie, and whollye drowned in sorrow: whereas Folly quickeneth his spirite, maketh him sing, daunce, leape, and frame himselfe altogether to pleasure. It is not possible that Loue shuld be without the daughter of youth, which is Folly. For Loue springeth of sodaine and sundry causes, by receyuing an Apple, as Cydippe : by looking out at a Windowe, as Scylla : by reading in a Booke, as the Ladye Frauncis Rymhi : some fall in loue by sight, some by hearing, but all liuing in hope to obtane their desires. And yet some haue loued without anye naturall cause, as Pigmalion , who fell in Loue with his marble picture, & I pray you what Sympathia could there be betweene a lyuely youth, and a dead stone, what was it then but Folly that kindled this flame? what forced Narcissus to fall in Loue with his owne shadowe, but Folly. Yea, what aduenture is passed in loue without Folly. For the Philosophers define Folly to be a depriuation of Wisedome, and Wisedome is altogether without passions: of the which when Loue shall be voyde, then no doubt the sea shall be without waues, and the Fire without heate. Consider but a young man which onely placeth his delight in amorous conceiptes, decking, dressing, and perfuming himselfe most delicately, who passeth out of his lodging, fraught with a thousand sundry fancies, accompanied with men and pages, passing to the place where he may haue a sight of his Mistres, obtaining for his trauell no gain but perhaps some amorous glaunce, making long sutes, spending his time and his treasure, consuming his wit, and wasting his wealth, and yet reaping nothing but disdaine and discredite. But if it chaunce that his Mistresse condiscend vnto his requests, she appoynteth him to come at some suspitious houre, which he cannot performe without great perill. To come with companie, were to bewray his secrets: to go alone, most daungerous: to goe openly, too manifest: so that he must passe disguised, sometime like a woman, other times like a peasant or some vilde person, scaling the walles with ladders, clyming vp to the windowes by cordes: yea, continually in daunger of death, if Follye did not holde him vp by the hand. It is not also vnknowen vnto you how manye sundrye passions doo perplexe the poore passionate Louers, all which proceede of Folly, as to haue ones heart seperated from himselfe, to be nowe in peace and than in warre, now couering his dolour, blushing one while and looking pale another, fraught wholly with feare, hope and shame, seeking that carefully which he seemeth to flie, & yet doubtfully dreading not to find it, to laugh seldome, to sigh often, to burn in cold, & freeze in heate, to be crossed altogether wt cotraries, which be signs not only of folly but of phresie. Who shall excuse Hercules , handling so carefully the distaste of Omphale , or Salomon for combring himselfe with so many Concubines, Annibal in submitting himselfe to his loue, Aristotle in obeying Hermia , and Socrates in yeelding to Aspasia , and many other which we see daily to be so blinded, as they knowe not themselues, and what is the cause heereof but folly, so that we see that it is she which maketh loue to be so feared & redoubted, it is shee that honoureth him, exalteth his name, and causeth him to be counted as a God. Further, whosoeuer loueth must applie himselfe to the affection of his mistresse, although it be contrarie to his natural constitution, if he be quiet, wise and discreete, yet if his louer please to haue him chaunge his state, he must turne his stearn and hoise his saile to goe with another winde, Zethius and Amphion could not agree, for because the delight of the one was a despight to the other, vntill Amphion left his musicke. If the Lady whom thou louest be couetous, thou must chaunge thy selfe into golde, and so fall into her bosome, if she be merrie, thou must be pleasaunt, if sullen, thou must be sad. All the seruauntes and sutors to Atlanta were hunters, because she delighted in that sport. Many Gentlewomen to please their louers which were Poets, left the rocke and the needle, and tooke in hand pens and bookes: now tell me if these straunge Metamorphosis be not meere pointes of folly? Doe you thinke that a souldier which goeth to the assalt, marketh ye trenches, thinketh of his enimies, or of a thousande harguebushes, wherof euerie one is sufficient to destroy him? No, he only hopeth to win the conquest, and doth not so much as once imagine the rest. He which first inuented sailing, doubted not of the perillous daungers: and he that playeth, neuer thinketh to become a looser, yet are they all three in daunger to be slaine, drowned, and vndoone. But
