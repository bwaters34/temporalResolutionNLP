 to detayne the childe to longe in that tedious labours/eyther in the greke or latyne gramer. For a gentyll wytte is there with sone fatigate. Grammer/beinge but an introduction to the vnderstading of autors/if it be made to longe or exquisite to the lerner/hit in a maner mortifieth his corage: And by that time he cometh to the most swete & pleasat redinge of olde autors/the sparkes of feruent desire of lernynge is extincte/with the burdone of gramer/lyke as a lyttell fyre is sone quenched with a great heape of small stickes: so that it can neuer come to the principall logges/where it shuld loge bourne in a great pleasaut fire. Nowe to folowe my purpose: after a fewe and quicke rules of gramer/immediately or interlasynge hit therwith/wolde be redde to the childe/Esopes 2 fables in greke: in whiche argument childre moche do delite. And surely it is a moche pleasant lesson/ & also profitable/as well for that it is elegat & brefe (& nat with standing it hath moche varietie in wordes/ and therwith moche helpeth to the vnderstandinge of greke) as also in those fables is included moche morall and politike wisedome. wherfore in the teachinge of them/ the maister diligently must gader to gyther those fables/whiche may be most accomodate to the aduauncement of some vertue/ wherto he perceiueth the childe inclined: or to the rebuke of some vice/wherto he findeth his nature disposed. And therin the master ought to exercise his witte/as wel to make the childe plainly to vnderstande the fable/as also declarynge the signification therof compendiously/and to the purpose. fore sene alwaye/that as well this lesson as all other autours/whiche the childe shall lerne/either greke or latine/verse or prose/ be perfectly had without the boke: wherby he shall nat only attaine plentie of the tonges called Copie/but also encrease and nourisshe remembrace wonderfully. The nexte 3 lesson wolde be some quicke and mery dialoges/ elect out of Luciane/whiche be with out ribawdry/or to moche skorning/for either 4 of them is exactly to be eschewed/specially for a noble man/the one anoyeng the soule/the other his estimation/concernyng his grauitie. The comedies of Aristophanes 5 may be in the place of Luciane/and by reason that they be in metre/they be the sooner lerned by harte/I dare make none other comparison betwene them/for offendyng the frendes of them both: but thus moche dare I say/that it were better that a childe shuld neuer rede any parte of Luciane than all Luciane. I coulde reherce diuers other poetic/whiche for mater and eloquence be very necessary/ but I feare me to be to longe from noble Homere: from whom as from a fountaine/ 6 proceded all eloquence and lernyng. For in his bokes be contained/and moste perfectly expressed/nat only the documetes marciall and discipline of armes/but also incomparable wisedomes/and instructions for politike gouernaunce of people: with the worthy comendation & laude of noble princis: where with the reders shall be so all inflamed/that they most feruently shall desire and coueite/by the imitation of their vertues/to acquire semblable glorie. For the whiche occasion Aristotel moost sharpest witted/& excellent lerned Philisopher/ as sone as he had receiued Alexander from kynge Philip his father: he before any other thynge taught hym the mooste noble warkes of Homere. wherin Alexander founde suche swetenes and frute/that euer after he had Homere/nat onely with hym in all his iournayes/but also laide hym vnder his pillowe/whan he went to reste: and often tymes wolde purposely wake some houres of the nyght/to take as it were his passe tyme with that mooste noble poete. For by the redinge of his warke called Iliados / where the assembly of the most noble grekes agayne Troy is recited with theyr affaires/he gathered courage and strength agayne his ennemies/wysedome and eloquence for consultations and persuations to his people and army. And by the other warke called Odissea /whiche recouteth the sondry aduentures of the wise Vlisses: he by the example of Vlisses/apprehended many noble vertues: and also lerned to eskape the fraude & deceitfull imaginatios of sondry & subtile crafty wittes. Also there/ shall he lerne to enserche and perceiue the maners and conditios of them that be his familiars/siftinge out (as I mought say) the best fro the warst/wherby he may surely comitte his affaires and truste to euery persone after his vertues. Therfore I nowe conclude/that there is no lesson for a yonge gentil man to be compared with Homere/if he be playnly and substacially expouned and declared by the mayster. Nat withstandinge for as moche as the saide warkes be very longe/and do require therfore a great time to be all lerned and kanned: some latine autour wolde be therwith 7 myxte/and specially Virgile: whiche in his warke called Eneidos /is most lyke to Homere/and all moste the same Homere in latine. Also by the ioynynge to gether of those autors/the one shall be the better vnderstande by the other. And verily (as I before saide) none one autour serueth to so diuers witts as doth Virgile. For there is nat that affect or desire/wherto any childes fantasie is disposed/but in some of Virgils warkes may be founden matter therto apte and propise. For what thinge can be more familiar than his bucolikes? nor no warke so nighe approcheth to the comune daliaunce/and maners of children/and the praty cotrouersies of the simple shepeherdes therin cotained/wonderfully reioyceth the childe that hereth hit well declared/as I knowe by myne owne experience. In his Georgikes/lorde what pleasaunt varietie there is: the diuers graynes/herbes/and flowres/that be there described/that redig therin hit semeth to a man to be in a delectable gardeine or paradise. what ploughe man knoweth so moche of husbandry/as there is expressed? who delitynge in good horsis/shall nat be therto more enflamed/ reding there/of the bredyng/chesinge/and kepyng of them? In the declaration wher of/Virgile leaueth farre behynde hym all breders/hakney men/and skosers. Is there any astronomer/that more exactly setteth out the ordre and course of the celestiall bodies: or that more truely dothe deuine in his pronostications of the tymes of the yere/ in their qualities/with the future astate of all thinges prouided by husbandry/than Virgile doth recite in that warke? If the childe haue a delite in huntyng/ what pleasure shall he take of the fable of Aristeus? semblably in the huntynge of Dido and Eneas/whiche is discriued moste elegantly in his boke of Eneidos. If he haue pleasure in wrastling/rennyng/ or other lyke exercise/where shall he se any more plesant esbatementes/than that whiche was done by Eurealus & other troyas/ whiche accompanyed Eneas? If he take solace in hearynge minstrelles/ what minstrel may be compared to Iopas/ whiche sange before Dido and Eneas? or to blinde Demodocus/that played & sange moste swetely at the dyner/that the kynge Alcinous made to Vlisses? whose dities & melodie excelled as farre the songes of our minstrelles/as Homere and Virgile excelle all other poetes. If he be more desirous (as the most parte of children be) to here thinges marueilous and exquisite/whiche hath in it a visage of some thinges incredible: wherat shall he more wonder/than whan he shall beholde Eneas folowe Sibille in to helle? what shal he more drede/than the terrible visages of Cerberous/Gorgon/Megera/and other furies & monsters? howe shall he abhorre tyranny/fraude/& auarice/whan he doth se the paynes of duke Theseus/Prometheus/ Sisiphus/and suche other/tourmented for their dissolute and vicious lyuyng? Howe glad soone after shall he be/whan he shall beholde in the pleasat feldes of Elisius/the soules of noble princes & capitaines/which for their vertue and labours/in aduauncing the publike weales of their coutrayes/ do lyue eternally in pleasure inexplicable? And in the laste bokes of Eneidos/shall he finde matter to ministre to hym audacite/ valiaunt courage/and policie/to take and susteyne noble enterprises/if any shall be nedefull for the assailynge of his enemies. Finally (as I haue saide) this noble Virgile/ like to a good norise/giueth to a childe/ if he wyll take it/euery thinge apte for his witte and capacitie. wherfore he is in the ordre of lernyng to be preferred before any other autor latine. I wolde set nexte vnto hym two bokes of Ouid/the one called Metamorphosios /whiche is as moche to saye/as chaungynge of men in to other figure or fourme: the other is intitled De fastis: where the ceremonies of the gentiles/and specially the Romanes/ be expressed: bothe right necessary for the vnderstandynge of other poetes. But by cause there is litell other lernyng in them/ concernyng either vertuous maners or policie/ I suppose it were better that as fables and ceremonies happen to come in a lesson/ it were declared abundatly by the maister/ than that in the saide two bokes/a longe tyme shulde be spente & almost lost: which mought be better employed on suche autors/ that do minister both eloquence/ciuile policie/and exhortation to vertue. wherfore in his place let vs bringe in Horace/ in whom is contayned moche varietie of lernynge/and quickenesse of sentence. This poet may be enterlaced with the lesson of Odissea of Homere/wherin is declared the wonderfull prudence and fortitude of Vlisses/in his passage from Troy. And if the childe were induced to make versis by the imitation of Virgile and Homere/ it shulde ministre to hym moche dilectation & courage to studie: ne the makig of versis is nat discomeded in a noble man: sens the noble Augustus/and almost all the olde emperours made bokes in versis. be very expedient to be lerned: for the one setteth out the emulation in qualities & prowesse of two noble and valiant capitaynes/ one enemy to the other/that is to say/Silius writeth of Scipio/the romane/ & Haniball/ duke of Cartaginensis: Lucane declareth a semblable mater/but moche more lamentable: for as moche as the warres were ciuile/and as it were in the bowelles of the Romanes/that is to say/vnder the standerdes of Iulius Cesar and Pompei. Hesiodus in greke/is more briefe tha Virgile/ where he writeth of husbandry: and doth nat rise so high in philosophie: but is fuller of fables: And therfore is more illecebrous. And here I conclude to speke any more of poetis necessary for the childehode of a gentill man: for as moche as these I doubt nat will suffice vntill he passe the age of.xiij. yeres. In which time childhode declineth/ and reason waxeth rype/and deprehendeth thinges with a more constant iugement. Here I wolde shulde be remembred/that I require nat that all these warkes shud be throughly radde of a childe in this tyme/ whiche were almost impossible: But I only desire that they haue in euery of the saide bokes so moche instruction/that they may take therby some profite. Than the childes 9 courage inflamed by the frequent redynge  of noble poetes/dayly more and more desireth to haue experience in those thinges/ that they so vehemently do commende in them/that they write of. Leonidas/the noble kynge of Spartanes/ beinge ones demaunded/of what estimation in poetry Tirtaeus (as he supposed) was: it is writen that he answeryng saide/ that for sterynge the myndes of yonge men he was excellet/for as moche as they being meued with his versis do rene in to the bataile/ regardyng no perile/as men all inflamed in martiall courage. And whan a man is comen to mature yeres/ and that reaso in him is cofirmed with serious lerning & longe experiece: tha shall he in redyng tragoedies execrate & abhorre the intollerable life of tyrantes: And shall contemne the foly and dotage expressed by poetes lasciuious. Here wyll I leaue to speake of the fyrste parte of a noble mannes studie: And nowe wyll I write of the seconde parte/whiche is more serious/and containeth in it sondry maners of lernynge. lesson of poetes. Cap.xj. After that .xiiij. yeres be passed of a childes age: His maister if he can/or some other studiouslye exercised in the arte of an oratour/shall firste rede to hym some what of that parte 10 of logike that is called Topica /eyther of Cicero/or els of that noble clerke of Almaine/ which late floured/called Agricola: whose warke prepareth inuention/tellynge the places/from whens an argument/for the profe of any mater/may be taken with litle studie: And that lesson with moche & diligent lernyng/hauyng mixte there with none other exercise/will in the space of halfe a yere be perfectly kanned. wolde be semblably taught/either in greke out of Hermogines/or of Quintilian in latine/begynnyng at the thirde boke/and instructyng diligently the childe in that parte of rhethorike/principally whiche cocerneth persuation: for as moche as it is most apte for consultations. There can be no shorter instruction of Rhetorike/than the treatise that Tulli wrate vnto his sone/which boke is named the partition of rhetorike. And in good faythe to speake boldly that I thinke: for him that nedeth nat/or doth nat desire to be an exquisite oratour/the litle boke made by the famous Erasmus (whom 12 all gentill wittis are bouden to thanke/and supporte) whiche he calleth Copiam verborum et Rerum /that is to say/pletie of wordes and maters/ shall be sufficient. Isocrates cocerning the lesson of oratours is euery where wonderfull profitable/hauynge almost as many wyse sentences as he hath wordes: and with that is so swete & delectable to rede/that after him almost all other seme vnsauery and tedious: and in persuadynge/as well a prince as a priuate persone to vertue/in two very litle and copendious warkes/wherof he made the one to kynge Nicocles/the other to his frende Demonicus/wolde be perfectly kanned and had in continuall memorie. Demosthenes and Tulli/by the consent of all lerned men/haue preeminence and soueraintie ouer all oratours: the one reignyng in woderfull eloquence in the publike weale of the Romanes/who had the empire and dominion of all the worlde/the other of no lasse estimation in the citie of Athenes/whiche of longe tyme was accounted the mother of Sapience/and the palaice of musis and all liberall sciences. Of whiche two oratours may be attayned/nat onely eloquence excellent and perfecte/but also preceptes of wisedome and gentyll maners: with most comodious examples of all noble vertues and pollicie. wherfore the maister in redynge them/muste well obserue and expresse the partis and colours of rhetorike in them contayned/accordynge to the preceptes of that arte before lerned. by redyng these oratours is/that whan he shall happe to reason in counsaile/or shall speake in a great audience/or to strange ambassadours of great princes/he shall nat be constrayned to speake wordes sodayne/and disordred/but shal bestowe them aptly and in their places. wherfore the moste noble emperour Octauius is highly comended/ 13 for that he neuer spake in the Senate or to the people of Rome/but in an oration prepared and purposely made. Also to prepare the childe to vnderstandynge of histories/whiche beinge replenished with the names of countrayes and townes vnknowen to the reder/do make the historie tedious/or els the lasse pleasat/ so if they be in any wyse knowen/it encreaseth an inexplicable delectatio. It shall be 14 therfore and also for refreshing the witte/a couenient lesson to beholde the olde tables of Ptholomee/where in all the worlde is paynted/hauynge firste some introduction in to the sphere/wherof nowe of late be made very good treatises/and more playne and easie to lerne than was wonte to be. All be it there is none so good lernynge/as the demostration of cosmographie/by materiall figures and instrumentes/hauynge a good instructour. And surely this lesson is bothe pleasant and necessary. For what pleasure is it/in one houre to beholde those realmes/cities/sees/ryuers/and mountaynes/ that vneth in an olde mannes life can nat be iournaide and pursued? what incredible delite is take in beholding the diuersities of people/beastis/foules/fisshes/trees/ frutes/and herbes? to knowe the sondry maners & conditions of people/and the varietie of their natures/and that in a warme studie or perler/without perill of the see/or daunger of longe and paynfull iournayes? I can nat tell/what more pleasure shulde happen to a gentil witte/than to beholde in his owne house euery thynge that with in all the worlde is contained. The comoditie therof knewe the great kynge Alexander/ as some writars do remembre. For he caused the countrayes/whervnto he purposed any enterprise/diligently and counningly to be discribed and paynted/that beholdynge the picture/he mought perceyue whiche places were most daugerous: & where he & his host mought haue most easy & couenable passage. Semblably dyd the Romanes in the rebellion of France/and the insurrection of theyr confederates/settynge vp a table openly/wherin Italy was painted/to the intet that the people lokyng in it/shuld reason & consulte in whiche places hit were best to resiste or inuade their ennemies. I omitte for length of the matter/to write of Cirus the great kinge of Perse/Crassus the Romane/and dyuers other valiant and experte capitaines: whiche haue lost them selfes & all their army by ignorance of this doctryne. wherfore it maye nat be of any wyse man denied/but that Cosmographie is to all noble men/nat only pleasant but profitable also/and wonderfull necessary. In the parte of cosmographie/wherwith historie is mingled/Strabo reigneth: whiche toke his argument of the diuine poete Homere. Also Strabo hym selfe (as he saith) laboured a great part of Africa and Egypte/where vndoubtedly be many thinges to be maruailed at. Solinus writeth almost in like forme and is more brefe/ & hath moche more varietie of thiges & maters/and is therfore maruailous delectable: yet Mela is moche shorter/ & his stile (by reason that it is of a more antiquitie) is also more clene & facile. wherfore he or Dionisius/shall be sufficient. of histories: but fyrst to set hym in a feruent courage/the mayster in the mooste pleasant and elegant wise/expressinge what incomparable delectation/vtilitie/and commodite shal happen to emperours/kinges/ princis/and all other gentil men/by reding of histories: Shewinge to hym: that Demetrius Phalareus/a man of excellet wisedome and lerninge/and whiche in Athenes had be loge exercised in the publike weale/ exhorted Ptholomee kyng of Egipt chiefly aboue all other studyes to haunte and embrace histories/ & suche other bokes/wherin were contayned preceptes made to kynges and princes: sayng that in them he shulde rede those thinges/whiche no ma durst reporte vnto his parsone. Also Cicero/father of the latin eloquece/calleth an historie the witnesse of tymes/maistres of life/the lyfe of remembrance/of trouthe the lyght/and messager of antiquite. Moreouer the swete Isocrates exhorteth the kynge Nicocles/ whom he instructeth to leaue behynde him statues and images that shall represent rather the figure & similitude of his mynde/ than the features of his body/signifienge therbye the remembraunce of his actes writen in histories. By semblable aduertisementes shall a noble harte be trayned to delite in histories. And than accordynge to the counsayle of Quintilian/it is best that he begynne with Titus Liuius/nat onely for his elegancie of 16 writinge/whiche floweth in him like a foutaine of swete milke: but also for as moche as by redynge that autor/he maye knowe howe the mooste noble citie of Rome of a small & poure begynnynge/by prowes and vertue/litell and litell came to empire and dominion of all the worlde. Also in that citye he maye beholde the fourme of a publike weale: whiche if the insolencie and pryde of Tarquine had nat excluded kynges out of the citie/it had ben the most noble and perfect of all other. and an excellent capitayne/so inuented and ordred his warke named Paedia Cyri: whiche may be interpreted the Childehode or discipline of Cyrus/that he leaueth to the reders therof an incomparable swetenes and example of lyuynge/specially for the conductynge and well ordring of hostes or armyes. And therfore the noble Scipio/who was called Affricanus/as well in peace as in warre/was neuer seene without this boke of Xenophon. with hym maye be ioyned Quintus Curtius/ who writeth the life of kyng Alexader elegantly & swetely In whom may be fouden the figure of an excellent prince/as he that incomparably excelled al other kinges and emperours/in wysedome/hardynes/ strength/policie/agilite/valiaunt courage/ nobilitie/liberalitie/and curtaisie. where in he was a spectakle or marke for all princes to loke on Contraryewise/whan he was ones vainquisshed with voluptie & pride/ his tiranny and beastly crueltie abhorreth all reders. The comparison of the vertues of these two noble princes/equally described by two excellent writars/well expressed/ shall prouoke a gentil courage to contende to folowe their vertues. Iulius Cesar and Salust for their compendious writynge/to the vnderstandynge wherof is required an exact & perfect iugement/ and also for the exquisite ordre of bataile/ and continuinge of the historie/without any varietie/wherby the payne of studie shulde be alleuiate: they two wolde be reserued/vntyll he that shall rede them/ shall se some experiece in seblable matters. And than shal he finde in them suche pleasure & comodite/as therwith a noble & gentyl harte ought to be satisfied. For in them both it shall seme to a ma that he is preset & hereth the cousayles and exhortations of capitaines/whiche be called Conciones/ and that he seeth the ordre of hostes/wha they be embatayled: the fiers assaultes and encountringes of bothe armies: the furiouse rage of that monstre called warre. And he shall wene that he hereth the terrible dintes of sondry weapons/and ordinaunce of bataile: the conducte and policies of wise & expert capitaines/specially in the comentaries of Iulius Cesar: whiche he made of his exploiture in Fraunce and Brytayne/ and other countraies nowe rekned amonge the prouinces of Germany. whiche boke is studiously to be radde of the princes of this realme of Englande and their counsailours: considering that therof maye be taken necessary instructions concernynge the warres/agayne Irisshe men or Scottes: who be of the same rudenes and wilde disposition/ that the Suises & Britons were in the time of Cesar. Seblable vtilitie shal be founden in the historie of Titus Liuius in his thirde Decades: where he writeth of the batayles that the Romanes had with Annibal and the Charthaginensis. Also there be dyuers orations/as well in all the bokes of the saide autors/as in the 18 historie of Cornelius Tacitus: whiche be very delectable/and for counsayles very expedient to be had in memorie. And in good faythe I haue often thought that the cosultations & orations wryten by Tacitus do importe a maiestie with a compendious eloquence therin contained. In the lerning of these autors/a yonge getilman shal be taught to note & marke/nat only the ordre & elegancie in declaration of the historie: but also the occasion of the warres: the cousailes & preparations on either part: the estimation of the capitaines/ the maner & fourme of theyr gouernance: the continuance of the bataile: the fortune & successe of the holle affaires. Semblably out of the warres in other dayly affaires/ the astate of the publike weale: if hit be prosperous or in decaye. what is the very occasyon of the one or of the other: the forme and maner of the gouernace therof/ the good and euyll qualities of them that be rulers: the comodites and good sequele of vertue: the discommodies and euyll conclusion of vicious licence. Surely if a noble man do thus seriously and diligently rede histories/I dare affirme there is no studie or science for him of equal comoditie and pleasure: hauynge regarde to euery tyme and age. By the time that the childe do com to.xvij. yeres of age/to the intent his courage be bridled with reason: hit were nedefull to 19 rede vnto hym some warkes of philosophie: specially that parte that may enforme him vnto vertuous maners: whiche parte of philosophie is called morall. wherfore there wolde be radde to hym for an introduction two the fyrste bokes of the warke of Aristotell/called Ethicae: wherin is contained the definitions and propre significatios of euery vertue: and that to be lerned in greke: for the translations that we yet haue/be but a rude and grosse shadowe of the eloquence & wisedome of Aristotell. Forthe with wolde folowe the warke of Cicero called in latin De officiis : whervnto  20 yet is no propre englisshe worde to be gyuen: but to prouide for it some maner of exposition/ it may be sayde in this fourme: Of the dueties and maners appertaynynge to men. But aboue all other/the warkes of Plato wolde be most studiously radde/wha the iugement of a man is come to perfectio/ and by the other studies is instructed in the fourme of speakynge that philosophers vsed. Lorde god/what incomparable swetnesse of wordes and mater shall he finde in the saide warkes of Plato & Cicero: wherin is ioyned grauitie with dilectation: excellent wysedome with diuine eloquence: absolute vertue with pleasure incredible: & euery place is so infarced with profitable counsaile/ioyned with honestie: that those thre bokes be almoste sufficient to make a perfecte and excellent gouernour. The prouerbes of Salomon with the bokes of Ecclesiastes and Ecclesiasticus be very good lessons. All the historiall partes of the bible/be righte necessarye for to be radde of a noble man/after that he is mature in yeres. And the residue (with the newe testament) is to be reueretly touched/ as a celestiall iewell or relike/hauynge the chiefe interpretour of those bokes trewe and constant faithe/and dredefully to sette handes theron/remembrynge that Oza for puttyng his hande to the holy shryne/that was called Archa federis /whan it was broughte by kyng Dauid fro the citie of Gaba/ though it were wauerynge and in daunger to fall/yet was he stryken of god/and fell deed immediately. It wolde nat be forgoten/ that the lytell boke of the most excellent doctour Erasmus Roterodame (whiche he wrate to Charles/nowe beynge emperour/ and than prince of Castile) whiche booke is intituled the Institution of a christen prince/ wolde be as family are alwaye with gentilmen at all tymes and in euery age/as was Homere with the great king Alexander/or Xenopho with Scipio: for as all men may iuge/that haue radde that warke of Erasmus: 21 that there was neuer boke written in latine/that in so lytle a portion/contayned of sentence/eloquence/and vertuous exhortation/ a more compendious abundaunce. And here I make an ende of the lernynge and studie/wherby noble men may attayne to be worthy to haue autoritie in a publike weale. Alway I shall exhorte tutours and gouernours of noble chyldren/that they suffre them nat to vse ingourgitations of meate or drinke/ne to slepe moche/that is to saye/aboue.viij. houres at the moste. For vndoubtedly bothe repletion and superfluous slepe/be capitall enemies to studie/as they be semblably to helth of body & soule. 22 Aulus Gellius sayth that children/if they vse of meate and slepe ouer moche/be made therwith dull to lerne: and we se that therof slownesse is taken/ & the childrens personages do waxe vncomely/& lasse growe in stature. Galen wyll nat permitte that pure wyne without alay of water/shulde in any wyse be gyuen to children/for as moche as it humecteth the body or maketh it moyster & hotter than is conuenient: also it fylleth the heed with fume/in them specially whiche be lyke as children of hote & moiste temperature. These be well nighe the wordes of the noble Galen. auncient noble men. Chapi. xii. men be nat as excellent in lernyng as they were in olde tyme amonge the Romanes and grekes. Surely as I haue diligently marked in dayly experiece/the principall causes be these. The pride/auarice/and negligence of parentes: and the lacke or fewenesse of suffycient maysters or teachers. As I sayd/pride is the first cause of this incouenience. For of those persons be some/ which without shame dare affirme/that to a great getilman/it is a notable reproche to be well lerned/ & to be called a great clerke: whiche name they accounte to be of so base estymation/that they neuer haue it in their mouthes/but whan they speke any thynge in derision: whiche perchaunce they wolde nat do if they had ones layser to rede our owne cronicle of Englade/where they shall 23 fynde/that kynge Henry the first/sonne of willyam conquerour/and one of the moste noble princes that euer reigned in this realme/ was opely called Henry beau clerke: whiche is in englysshe/fayre clerke/and is yet at this day so named. And wheder that name be to his honour or to his reproche/ let them iuge that do rede & compare his lyfe with his two bretherne/william/called Rouse/and Robert le courtoise/they both nat hauyng seblable lernyng with the sayd Henry/the one for his dissolute lyuyng and tyranny/beynge hated of all his nobles & people/finally was sodaynely slayne by the shotte of an arowe/as he was huntynge in a forest/whiche to make larger/and to gyue his deere more lybertie/he dyd cause the houses of .lii. parisshes to be pulled downe/ the people to be expelled/and all beyng desolate/ to be tourned in to desert/and made onely pasture for beestes sauage. whiche he wolde neuer haue done/if he had as moche delyted in good lernig/as dyd his brother. The other brother Robert le Curtoise/beyng duke of Normandie & the eldest sonne of wylliam Conquerour: all be it that he was a man of moche prowesse/and right expert in martial affayres: wherfore he was electe before Godfray of Boloigne to haue ben kyng of Hierusalem: yet natwithstandynge/ whan he inuaded this realme with sondrie puissaunt armies/also dyuers noble men aydinge hym: yet his noble brother Henry beau clerke/more by wysdome than power/also by lernynge/ addyng polycie to vertue and courage/often tymes vaynquisshed hym/and dyd put him to flyght. And after sondry victories/finally toke him and kepte hym in prison: hauyng none other meanes to kepe his realme in tranquillitie. It was for no rebuke/but for an excellent honour/that the emperour Antonine was surnamed philosopher/for by his most noble example of lyuing & industrie incomparable/ he during all the tyme of his reigne kept the publike weale of the Romanes in suche a perfecte astate/that by his actes he cofirmed the sayeng of Plato: That blessed is that publike weale/wherin either philosophers do reigne: or els kiges be in philosophie studiouse. These persones that so moche contemne lernyng/that they wolde that gentilmens children shulde haue no parte or very litle therof: but rather shulde spende their youth alway (I saye not onely in huntynge and haukyng/whiche moderately vsed as solaces ought to be/I intede nat to disprayse) but in those ydle pastymes/ whiche for the vice that is therin/the comaundement of the prince/and the vniuersall cosent of the people expressed in statutes & lawes do prohibite/I meane playeng at dyce and other games named vnlefull. These persones I say/I wolde shulde remembre/or elles nowe lerne/if they neuer els herde it/that the noble Philip kyng of Macedonia/who subdued al Grece/aboue all the good fortunes that euer he hadde/ most reioysed that his sonne Alexader was borne in the tyme that Aristotle the philosopher flourisshed/by whose instruction he mought attaine to most excellent lernynge. Also the same Alexader often tymes sayd/ that he was equally as moche bounden to Aristotle as to his father kyng Philip: for of his father he receyued lyfe: but of Aristotle he receyued the waye to lyue nobly. who dispraysed Epaminondas/the mooste valiant capitayne of Thebanes/for that he was excellently lerned and a great philosopher? who euer discomeded Iulius Cesar/ for that he was a noble oratour/ & nexte to Tulli in the eloquence of the latin tonge excelled al other? who euer reproued the emperour Hadriane/for that he was so exquisitely lerned/nat onely in greke and latine/ but also in all sciences liberall/that openly at Athenes in the vniuersall assebly of the greatteste clerkes of the worlde/he by a loge tyme disputed with philosophers and Rhetoriciens/whiche were estemed mooste excellet/& by the iugemet of them that were preset/had the palme or rewarde of victorie? And yet by the gouernace of that noble emperour/ nat only the publik weale florisshed/ but also diuers rebellios were suppressed/& the maiesty of the empire hugely increased. was it any reproche to the noble Germanicus (who by the assignemet of Augustus shulde haue succeded Tiberius in the empire/ if traitorous enuy had nat in his flourysshynge youth bireft hym his lyfe) that he was equall to the moost noble poetes of his time: and to the increase of his honour and moost worthy comendation/his image was set vp at Rome in the habite that poetes at those dayes vsed? Fynally howe moche excellent lernynge commendeth and nat dispraiseth nobilitie/it shal playnly appere vnto them that do rede the lyfes of Alexander/called Seuerus/Tacitus/Probus/ Aurelius/Constantine/Theodosius/ & Charles the gret/surnamed Charlemaine/ all beinge emperours: and do compare them with other whiche lacked or had nat so moche of doctrine. Verily they be ferre from good raison in myne opinion/whiche couaite to haue their children goodly in stature/ stronge/deliuer/well singyng: wherin trees/beastes/fysshes/and byrdes/be nat only with them equall/but also ferre do excede them: And connynge/wherby onely man excelleth all other creatures in erthe/ they reiecte and accoute vnworthy to be in their children. what vnkinde appetite were it to desyre to be father rather of a pece of flesshe/that can onely meue and feele/than of a childe/that shulde haue the perfecte fourme of a man? what so perfectly expresseth a man as doctrine? Diogines the philosopher seing one without lernynge syt on a stone/sayde to them that were with him/beholde where one stone sytteth on an other. whiche wordes well considered and tried/shall appere to contayne in it wonderfull matter/for the approbatio of doctrine. wherof a wyse man maye accumulate ineuitable argumentes: whiche I of necessite/ to auoide tediousnes/must nedes passe ouer at this tyme. The seconde occasion wherfore gentylmens children seldome haue sufficient lernynge/is auarice: For where theyr parentes wyll nat aduenture to sende them farre out of theyr propre countrayes/ partely for feare of dethe/whiche perchace dare nat approche them at home with theyr father: partely for expence of money/whiche they suppose wolde be lasse in theyr owne houses/or in a village with some of theyr tenantes or frendes: hauyng seldome any regarde to the teacher/whether he be well lerned or ignorant. For if they hiare a schole maister to teche in theyr houses/they chiefely enquire with howe small a salary he will be contented/ & neuer do inserche howe moche good lernynge he hath/and howe amonge well lerned men he is therin estemed/vsinge therin lasse diligence than in takynge seruantes/whose seruice is of moche lasse importance/and to a good schole maister is nat in profite to be compared. A gentil man/er he take a cooke in to his seruice/he wyll firste diligently examine hym/howe many sortes of meates/ potages/and sauces he can perfectly make/ and howe well he can seaso them/that they may be bothe pleasant and nourishynge. yea and if it be but a fauconer/he wyll scrupulously enquire/what skyll he hath in feedyng/ called diete/and kepyng of his hauke from all sickenes: also how he can reclaime her & prepare her to flyght. And to suche a cooke or fauconer/whom he findeth expert/ he spareth nat to gyue moche wages with other bouteous rewardes. But of a schole maister/to whom he will comitte his childe to be fedde with lernynge/and instructed in vertue/whose lyfe shall be the principall monument of his name and honour/he neuer maketh further enquirie/but where he may haue a schole maister: and with howe litle charge: & if one be perchance founden well lerned/but he will nat take paynes to teache without he may haue a great salary: he than speketh nothing more/or els saith: what shall so moche wages be gyuen to a schole maister/whiche wolde kepe me two seruauntes? to whom maye be saide these wordes/that by his sonne being wel lerned he shall receiue more commoditie and also worship/than by the seruice of a hundred cokes and fauconers. The thirde cause of this hyndrance is negligence of parentes/whiche I do specially note in this poynt/there haue bene diuers as well gentill men as of the nobilitie/that deliting to haue their sonnes excellent in lernynge/ haue prouided for them connynge maysters/who substancially haue taught them gramer/and very wel instructed them to speake latine elegantly: wherof the parentes haue taken moche delectation/but whan they haue had of gramer sufficient and be comon to the age of . xiiij. yeres/and do approche or drawe towarde the astate of ma: whiche age is called mature or ripe (wherin nat onely the saide lernyng continued by moche experience shal be perfectly digested & confirmed in perpetuall remembrance: but also more seriouse lernynge cotayned in other lyberall sciences/and also philosophy wolde than be lerned) the parentes/ that thinge nothinge regarding/but being suffised that their children can onely speke latine proprely: or make verses with out mater or sentence: they fro thens forth do suffre them to liue in idelnes/or els putting them to seruice/do as it were banisshe them from all vertuous study/or excercise/ of that whiche they before lerned: so that we may beholde diuers yonge gentill men/ who in their infancie and childehode/were wondred at for their aptnes to lerning/and prompt speakinge of elegant latine/whiche nowe beinge men/nat onely haue forgotten their congruite (as is the comune worde) & vnneth can speake one hole sentence in true latine: but that wars is/hath all lernynge in derision: and in skorne therof wyll of wantonnesse speake the moste barberously that they can imagine. Nowe some ma wyll require me to shewe myne opinion/if it be necessary that gentilmen shulde after the age of . xiiij. yeres cotinue in studie. And to be playne and trewe therin: I dare affirme/that if the elegant speking of latin be nat added to other doctrine/ litle frute may come of the tonge/sens latine is but a naturall speche/and the frute of speche is wyse sentence/whiche is gathered and made of sondry lernynges. And who that hath nothinge but langage only/may be no more praised than a popiniay/ a pye/or a stare/wha they speke featly. There be many nowe a dayes in famouse scholes & vniuersities/whiche be so moche gyuen to the studie of tonges onely/that whan they write epistles/they seme to the reder/that lyke to a trumpet they make a soune without any purpose: where vnto men do herken more for the noyse than for any delectatio that therby is meued. wher fore they be moche abused/that suppose eloquence to be only in wordes or coulours of Rhetorike/for as Tulli saith/what is so furiouse or mad a thinge/as a vaine soune of wordes of the best sort & most ornate/cotayning 24 neither connynge nor sentece? Vndoubtedly very eloquence is in euery toge/ where any mater or acte done or to be done is expressed in wordes clene/propise/ornate/ and comely: wherof sentences be so aptly compact/that they by a vertue inexplicable do drawe vnto them the mindes and cosent of the herers/they beinge therwith either parswaded/meued/or to delectation induced. Also euery man is nat an oratour/that can write an epistle or a flatering oratio in latin: where of the laste (as god helpe me) is to moche vsed. For a right oratour may nat be without a moche better furniture. Tulli saienge/that to him belongeth the explicating or vnfoldinge of sentence with a great estimation/in gyuing counsaile concerninge maters of great importaunce: also to him appertaineth the steringe and quickning of people languisshinge or dispeiringe/and to moderate them that be rasshe & vnbridled. wherfore noble autours do affirme/that in the firste infancie of the worlde/men wandring like beastes in woddes and on mountaines/ regardinge neither the religion due vnto god/nor the office pertainig vnto ma/ ordred all thing by bodily strength: vntill Mercurius (as Plato supposeth) or some other man holpen by sapience & eloquence/ by some apt or propre oration assebled them to geder/& perswaded to the/what comodite was in mutual couersatio& honest maners. 25 But yet Cornelius Tacitus describeth an oratour to be of more excellent qualities/ saynge that an oratour is he/that can or may speke or raison in euery question sufficiently/ elegatly: and to persuade proprely/ accordyng to the dignitie of the thyng that is spoken of/the oportunitie of time/ & pleasure of the that be herers. Tulli before him affirmed/that a man may nat be an oratour heaped with praise/but if he haue gotte the knowlege of all thynges/& artes of greattest importaunce. And howe shall an oratour speake of that thynge/that he hath nat lerned. And bicause there may be nothynge but it may happen to come in praise or dispraise/in consultation or iugement/in accusation or defence: therfore an oratour by others instruction perfectly furnisshed/ may in euery mater and lernynge/comende or dispraise: exhorte or dissuade: accuse or defende eloquently/as occasion hapneth. wherfore in as moche as in an oratour is required to be a heape of all maner of lernyng: whiche of some is called the worlde of science: of other the circle of doctrine/ whiche is in one worde of greeke Encyclopedia: therfore at this day/may be fouden but a very few oratours. For they that come in message from princes/be for honour named nowe oratours/if they be in any degre of worshyp: onely poore men hauyng equall or more of lernyng/beyng called messagers. Also they whiche do onely teache rhetorike/ whiche is the sciece wherby is taught an artifyciall fourme of spekyng: wherin is the power to persuade/moue/and delyte: or by that science onely do speke or write without any adminiculation of other sciences: ought to be named rhetoriciens/declamatours/ artificiall spekers (named in Greeke Logodedali ) or any other name than oratours. Semblably they that make verses/expressynge therby none other lernynge but the craft of versifyeng/be nat of aunciet writers named poetes/but onely called versifyers. For the name of a poete/wherat nowe (specially in this realme) men haue suche indignation/ that they vse onely poetes and poetry in the contempte of eloquence: was in auncient tyme in hygh estimation: in so moche that all wysdome was supposed to be therin included/and poetry was the first philosophy that euer was knowen: wherby me from their childhode were brought to the raison howe to lyue well/lernynge therby nat onely maners and naturall affections/ but also the wonderfull werkes of nature/mixting serious mater with thynges that were pleasaunt: as it shall be manifest to them that shall be so fortunate to rede the noble warkes of Plato and Aristotle: wherin he shall fynde the autoritie of poetes frequently alleged: ye and that more is: In poetes was supposed to be science misticall and inspired: and therfore in latine they were called, Dates: which worde signifyeth as moche as prophetes. And  26 therfore Tulli in his Tusculane questyons supposeth that a poete can nat abundantly expresse verses sufficient and complete/or that his eloquence may flowe without labour/ wordes wel sounyng and plentuouse/ without celestiall instinction. whiche is also by Plato ratified. But sens we be nowe occupied in the defence of Poetes/it shall nat be incongruent to our mater to shewe what profite may be taken by the diligent reding of auncient poetes/contrary to the false opinion that nowe rayneth of them that suppose/that in the warkes of poetes is contayned nothynge but baudry (suche is their foule worde of reproche) and vnprofitable leasinges. But first I wyll interprete some verses of Horace/wherin he expresseth the office of poetes: and after wyll I resorte to a more playne demonstration of some wisdomes and counsayles contayned in some verses of poetes. Horace in his seconde booke of epistles sayth in this wyse/or moche lyke. But they whiche be ignoraunt in poetes/ wyll perchaunce obiecte as is their maner/ agayne these verses/sayeng that in Therence and other that were writers of comedies: also Ouide/Catullus/Martialis & all that route of lasciuious poetes that wrate epistles and ditties of loue/some called in latine Elegiae/ & some Epigramata/ is nothyng contayned but incitation to lechery. First comedies whiche they suppose to be a doctrinall of rybaudrie/they be vndoutedly a picture or as it were a mirrour of mans life. wherin iuell is nat taught but discouered/ to the intent that men beholdynge the promptnes of youth vnto vice: the snares of harlottes & baudes laide for yonge myndes: the disceipte of seruantes: the chaunces of fortune cotrary to menes expectation: they beinge therof warned: may prepare them selfe to resist or preuente occasion. Seblably remebring the wisedomes: aduertisemetes: cousailes: dissuasion from vice & other profitable setences: most eloquetly & familiarely shewed in those comedies/Vndoubtedly there shall be no litle frute out of them gathered: And if the vices in them expressed shulde be cause that myndes of the reders shulde be corrupted: than by the same argumente nat onely entreludes in englisshe/ but also sermones wherin some vice is declared/ shulde be to the beholders and herers like occasion to encreace sinners. And that by comedies good counsaile is ministred: it appiereth by the sentence of Parmeno 28 in the seconde comedie of Therence. There be many mo wordes spoken whiche I purposely omitte to translate/nat withstandynge the substance of the hole sentence is herin comprised. But nowe to come to other poetes/what may be better saide than is written by Plautus in his firste comedie? 29 Also Ouidius/that semeth to be moste of all poetes lasciuious/in his mooste wanton bokes hath righte comendable and noble sentences: as for proufe therof I will recite some that I haue taken at aduenture. Martialis whiche for his dissolute wrytynge/ is mooste seldome radde of men of moche grauitie/hath nat withstandynge many comendable sentences and right wise counsailes/as amonge diuers I will reherce one/whiche is first come to my remebrance. 31 I coulde recite a great nombre of seblable good sentences out of these and other wanton poetes/who in the latine do expresse them incomparably with more grace & delectatio to the reder/than our englisshe tonge may yet comprehede. wherfore sens good & wise mater may be picked out of these poetes/it were no reason for some lite mater that is in their verses/to abadone therfore al their warkes/no more than it were to forbeare or prohibite a ma to come into a faire gardein/ leste the redolent sauours of swete herbes and floures shall meue him to wanton courage/ or leste in gadringe good and holsome herbes he may happen to be stunge with a nettile. No wyse ma entreth in to a gardein but he sone espiethe good herbes from nettiles/ and treadeth the nettiles vnder his feete whiles he gadreth good herbes. wher by he taketh no damage: or if he be stugen he maketh lite of it/ & shortly forgetteth it. Semblablye if he do rede wanton mater mixte with wisedome/he putteth the warst vnder foote/& sorteth out the beste/or if his courage be stered or prouoked/he remembreth the litel pleasure & gret detrimet that shulde ensue of it: and withdrawynge his mide to some other studie or exercise/shortly forgetteth it. And therfore amonge the iewes though it were prohibited to childre/ vntill they came to rype yeres to reade the bokes of Genesis/of the iuges/ Cantica Canticorum/ and some parte of the boke of Ezechiel the prophete/For that in them was contayned some matter/whiche moughte happe to incense the yonge mynde/wherin were sparkes of carnall concupiscence/yet after certayne yeres of mennes ages/it was lefull for euery man to rede and diligently studie those warkes. So all thoughe I do nat approue the lesson of wanton poetes to be taughte vnto all children: yet thynke I conuenient and necessary/that whan the mynde is become constante/and courage is asswaged/or that children of their naturall disposition be shamfaste & continent/ none auncient poete wolde be excluded from the leesson of suche one as desireth to come to the perfection of wysedome. But in defendynge of oratours and poetes I had all moste forgoten where I was. Verily there may no ma be an excellent poet nor oratour/ vnlasse he haue parte of all other doctrine specially of noble philosophie. And to say the trouth/no man can apprehede the very delectation that is in the lesson of noble poetes/vnlasse he haue radde very moche/ and in diuers autours of diuers lernynges. wherfore as I late said to the augmentatio of vnderstandyng called in latine Intellectus et mens /is required to be moche redyng and vigilaunt studie in euery science/specially of that parte of philosophie named morall: whiche instructeth men in vertue and politike gouernaunce. Also no noble autour specially of them that wrate in greke or latine before. xij. C. yeres passed/is nat for any cause to be omitted. For therin I am of Quintilianes opinion/that there is fewe or none auncient warke/that yeldethe nat some frute or comoditie to the diligent reders. And it is a very grosse or obstinate witte/that by readyng moche/is nat some what amended. Concernynge the election of other autours/to be radde/I haue (as I truste) declared sufficiently my conceipt and opinion/in the firste boke of this litle treatise. Finally like as a delicate tree/that cometh of a kernell/whiche as sone as it burgeneth out leues: if it be plucked vppe/or it be sufficiently rooted/and layde in a corner/ it becometh drye or rotten/and no frute cometh of it: if it be remoued and sette in an other ayre or erthe/whiche is of contrary qualities where it was before/it either semblably diethe/or beareth no frute/or els the frute that cometh of it/leseth his verdure and taste/and finally his estimation. So the pure and excellent lerning wherof I haue spoken/thoughe it be sowen in a childe neuer so tymely/and springeth and burgeneth neuer so pleasauntly/if byfore it take a depe rote in the mynde of the childe/ it be layde a syde/either by to moche solace/ or continuall attendaunce in seruice/or els is translated to an other studie/whiche is of a more grose or vnpleasaunt qualitie/ before it be confirmed or stablisshed by often reding or diligent exercise/in conclusion it vanissheth and cometh to no thing. wherfore lete men replie as they list/but in myne opinion/men be woderfully disceyued nowe a dayes (I dare nat saye with the persuasion of auarice) that do put their children at the age of. xiiij. or. xv. yeres to the studie of the lawes of the realme of Englande. I will shewe to them reasonable causes why/ if they wyll paciently here me/infourmed partely by myne owne experience. Histories. Cap. xxiiij. actes comitted or done by other men/wherof profite or damage succedynge/  32 we may (in knowynge or beholdinge it) be therby instructed to apprehende the thing/ which to the publike weale/or to our owne persones/may be commodious: and to exchue that thing/which either in the begynnyng/or in the conclusion appereth noisome and vicious. The knowledge of this Experience is called Example/and is expressed by historie/whiche of Tulli is called the life of memorie: And so it agreeth well with the versis of Affranius/by me late declared. And therfore to suche persones as do contemne auncient histories/reputing them amonge leasinges and fantises (these be their wordes of reproche) it may be sayd/that in contemnynge histories/they frustrate Experience: whiche (as the sayd Tulli sayeth) is the light of vertue/whiche they wolde be sene so moche to fauour/all thoughe they do seldome embrace it. And that shall they perceyue manifestly/if they will a litle while laye a parte their accustomed obstinacie/ & suffre to be distilled in to their eares two or thre dropes of the sweete oyle of remembrauce. Lete them reuolue in their myndes generally/that there is no doctrine/be it eyther diuine or humaine/that is nat eyther all expressed in historie/or at the leste mixte with historie. But to thentent that there shall be left none ignoraunce/wherby they mought be detayned in their errour/I will declare vnto theim what is that/that is called an historie/and what it comprehendeth. Firste it is to be noted/that it is a greke name/& commeth of a worde or verbe enserche/to enquire/to here/ to lerne/to tell/or expoude vnto other. And than muste historie/whiche cometh therof/ be wonderfull profitable/whiche leaueth nothinge hydde from mannes knowlege/ that vnto hym may be eyther pleasaunt or necessarie. For it nat onely reporteth the gestes or actes of princes or Capitaynes: their counsayles and attemptates: entreprises/ affaires/maners in lyuinge good and bad: descriptions of regions and cities with their inhabitauntes. But also it bringeth to our knowlege/the fourmes of sondry publike weales/with their augmetations and decayes/and occasion therof. More ouer preceptes/exhortations/counsayles/ & good persuasions comprehended in quicke sentences and eloquent orations. Finally so large is the compase of that whiche is named historie/that it comprehendeth all thynge that is necessary to be put in memorie. In so moche as Aristotell where he declareth the partes of mannes body with their description & offices: and also the sondry fourmes and dispositions of all bestes/foules/and fisshes/with their generation. He nameth his boke an historie. Semblably Theophrast his scholer a noble philosopher/descriuynge all herbes and trees/wherof he mought haue the true knowlege/intitleth his boke the historie of plantes. And finally Plini the elder/calleth his mooste excellent & wonderfull warke/the historie of nature: in the whiche boke he nothing ommitteth/ that in the bosome of Nature is cotayned/ and may be by mannes witte coprehended/ and is worthy to be had in remembraunce. whiche autorities of these thre noble & excellent lerned men: approueth the signification of Historie/to agree well with the exposition of the verbe historeo wherof it cometh. Nowe let vs se what booke of holy scripture/ I meane the olde testament and the newe/may be saide to haue no parte of historie. The fiue bokes of Moises/the boke of Iuges/the foure bokes of kynges/Iob/ Hester/Iudith/Ruth/Thobias/And also the historie of Machabees (whiche from the other is seperate) I suppose no man wil denie/but that they be all historicall: or (as I mought say) intier histories. Also Esdras Nemias/Ezechiel/and Daniel/all though they were prophetes: yet be their warkes compacte in fourme of narrations/whiche by oratours be called enunciatiue/and only pertaineth to histories: wherin is expressed a thyng done/and persones named. All the other prophetes/thoughe they speake of the tyme future or to come/whiche is out of the description of an historie/yet eitherr in rebukinge the sinnes & enormities passed/ or bewayling the destruction of their countray/ or captiuitie of the people/& suche like calamitie or miserable astate/also in meuing or prosuading the people/they do recite some circumstaunce of a narration. But nowe be we commen to the newe testament/& principally the bokes of the Euagelistes/vulgarely called the gospelles/which be one contexte of an historie: do nat they contayne the temporall lyfe of our sauyour Christ/kinge of kiges/& lorde of the worlde/vntill his glorious assention? And what thinge lacketh therin/that doth pertayne to a parfecte historie: There lacketh nat in thinges ordre & disposition /in the context or narration/veritie/ in the sentences grauitie/vtilitie in the cousailes/ in the persuasions doctrine/in expositions or declarations facilitie. The bokes of actes of apostels/what thinge is it els but a playne historie? The epistles of saint Paule/ saint Peter/saynt Iohn/saynt Iames/and Iudas the apostles do contayne cousailes & aduertisementes in the fourme of orations/ resitig diuers places as well out of the olde testamet/as out of the gospelles/as it were an abbreuiate called of the grekes & latines Epitoma . This is well knowen to be true/of them that haue hadde any leasure to rede holy scripture: who remebringe them selfes by this my litle induction wyll leaue to neglecte historie/or contemne it with so generall a disprayse as they haue bene accustomed? But yet some will impugne them with a more particuler obiection/sayenge that the histories of the Grekes and Romanes/ be nothyng but lyes & faynynge of poetes: (some suche persones there be/betwene whome and good autours haue euer ben perpetuell hostilitie). Firste howe do they knowe/that al the histories of grekes & Romanes be leasynges/sens they finde nat/that any scripture autentike/made about that tyme that those histories were writen/do reproue or codene the? But the most catholike & renoumed doctours of Christes religion/ in the corrobration of their argumetes and sentences/do alledge the same histories/and vouche (as I mought say) to their ayde the autoritie of the writars. And yet some of those Rabines (in goddes name) whiche in comparison of the sayde noble doctours/ be as who sayeth petites, & vnethe lettred: wyll presume with their owne selye wittes to disproue that/whiche both by auncientie of tyme/and consent of blessed & noble doctours is allowed/and by theyr warkes honoured. If they will coniecte histories to be lyes/bicause they somtyme make reporte of thynges sene/and actes done/whiche do seme to the reders incredible. By that same raison may they nat only codemne all holy scripture/whiche cotayneth thynges more wonderfull/tha any historien writeth/but also exclude credulitie vtterly from the copany of man. For howe many thinges be daily sene/ whiche beinge reported vnto him that neuer sawe them/shulde seeme impossible? And if they wyll allege/ that all thynge contayned in holy scripture is approbate by the hole consent of all the clergie of Christendome / at diuers generall counsailes assembled: Certes the same cousailes neuer disproued or reiected the histories of grekes or Romanes: but the moste catholike and excellent lerned men of those congregations embraced theyr examples/ and sowyng them in their warkes/made of them to the churche of Christe/a necessarie ornament. Admytte that some histories be interlaced with leasynges: why shulde we therfore neglecte them? sens/the affaires there reported/no thynge concerneth vs/ we beynge therof no parteners/ne therby onely/may receyue any damage. But if by redynge the sage counsayle of Nestor/the subtile persuasions of Vlisses/the compendious grauitie of Menelaus/the imperiall maiestye of Agamemnon/the prowesse of Achilles/ & valiaunt courage of Hector: we may apprehende any thinge/wherby our wittes may be amended/& our personages be more apte to serue our publike weale and our prince. what forceth it vs/though Homere write leasinges? I suppose no ma thinketh/ that Esope wrate gospelles: yet who doughteth/but that in his fables the foxe/ the hare/and the wolfe/though they neuer spake/do teache many good wysedomes & whiche beinge well consydered/men (if they haue nat auowed to repugne agayne reason) shall confesse with Quintilian that fewe/and vnethe one may be founde of auncient writars/which shall nat bringe to the redars some thinge comodious: And specially they that do write maters historicall/ the lesson wherof is as it were the mirrour of mannes life/expressinge actually/and (as it were at the eye) the beaultie of vertue/ & the deformitie and lothelynes of vice. Wherfore Lactantius sayeth: Thou muste nedes 33 perysshe/if thou knowe nat what is to thy life profitable/that thou maiste seke for it: & what is daungerous/that thou mayste flee and exchue it. Whiche I dare affirme may come soonest to passe by redynge of histories/ and retayninge them in continuell remembraunce.
