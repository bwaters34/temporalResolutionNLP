 birth-place; and as my Frends there pay dueties for the place they liue in, so tender I this here as part of my duteous loue. The Authour of the Booke hath left it to the wide world without a Patron, perchance esteeming it vnworthie protection: neyther doo I thinke it in the least part worthie your protection, before whose excelent iudgement (so daily conuersant among the most iudiciall) it cannot but vanish like light smoake before a bright flame. All my excuse is loue, all my request is pardon; which as (I first inferd) your noble disposition assures mee of. On which foundation building, I cease now to bee more bold. Your VVorships, most dutifully affectionate: Iohn Danter . Cornewall , with his rare atchiuements for faire Cellestina daughter to Lewes King of Fraunce . How Chinon the Earle of Cornewalles Sonne was borne a foole, and of the excellent ornaments of nature wherewith his faire Sister Laura was beautefied. In the beginning of this flourishing Kingdome, when Arthur then Monarch of this little worlde, with his attendant Knights, whose valorous exployts euerywhere acted for theyr Countries honour, hath eternized their euerliuing names, euen in the farthest coasts of the barbarous Pagans, where yet in despite of consuming time liues their eternal Trophies as spectacles for all posterities. In this time liued there in England an auncient Knight, whome this famous king for his many merits and well deseruing deedes, had installed in the Earledome of Cornewall , a dignity as hee thought fitting the deserts of this famous man, that had so often vndergone the furious attempts of the vnciuill Pagans, enemies to God, foes to his countrie, and great hindrances to the then but young plants of springing Christianity, as also endeuoring himselfe euery where to defend the fame of his countrie, then of all other only fame worthy the Honour of his order euery where honored, and the dutie belonging to his Knighthood, which hee alwaies performed, till at the last when the waight of many wearie yeares, gan bow his declining bodie downe to the lowly earth, making his oft tried Armour too heauie a burthen for his now war weakned body, his brandishing sword beating downe his age fallen armes, and euery supporter of his lustie limmes beginnes to faile of their former force, he determins to end his life in peace at home, whose beginning he had spent in warres abroad, incouraging younger men with the spectacle of his former valours, couragiously themselues to attempt the like indeuors. In which time of his home aboad, the heauens blessed him with two goodly Children, a Sonne & a Daughter: but yet as it is the continual course of al ruling fortune to mixe with euery good some ill, with euerie sweet a sowre, & with euery sunshine show of promising hap, a tempestuous storme of ill boading hurt, so fared it in the issue of this yet vnhappie Prince: for when the stealing houres of all ripening time had brought them from their Infant Cradelles to some participation of sencible knowledge, his Daughter whose name was Laura , so forwardly prospered in euery Liniament of her beautifull bodie, & all eternall quallities of a vertuous minde: so that in short time she became the censured subiect of all wise iudgements, in determination whether nature had better beautefied her bodie, (where indeede shee had exceeded herself) or the Gods quallified her mind, wherin they had made her the only similitude of themselues. No penne that was not busied in painting her praises, though all too little for that purpose, and no tongue but was still telling her perfections, though they neuer could attaine them: for too bright was her beautie, to be shadowed in the couloring cunning of a mortall capacitie, and too high her heauenly minde, to be enstauld with the earthlie weedes of mans base wit, that as the toile some Sailers in the dangerous Seas watching the misfortunes of a tedious night, doth with themselues mightily admire the gorgeous state of many twinckling stars, till when the siluer Moone proudlie rising from her glorious bed, drawes backe their daseled eies to behold her more than common countenance: so fares it in this age of theirs, where no starre may compare with her state, no face with her faire fortune, nor no grace with the least glimce of her glorie: so to leaue to expresse that in wordes, which could not bee comprehended in all wits, neuer did nature before compose of so rude a Chaos, so comely a creature: But her Brother whose name was Chynon , outwardly formed in as faire a fashion, as might well beseeme the sonne to such a sire, but in his minde more than a maimed man, wanting that portion of sensible capacity which commonly doth accompany euen the meanest seruillitie: So that by how much his Sister exceeded in extraordinarie wisedome, by so much was hee scanted in ordinarie witte, where in steede of Princely feature, was nothing found but foolish behauiour, for high atchiuementes boyish follies: for that which is required in a man, not so much as is commonly found in a childe, vncapable of the rudiments of good counsaile, and vnfit to conceiue the commoditie of comelie quallitie: whence as all men with admiration wondred at the one, so none but with commisseration pittied the other, that so well fashioned a body should containe so ill formed a minde, strongly had nature forged hys limbes, which promised his valour, but weakely had the enuious Fates framed his mind, wher was no hope of better, So that heere nature vnnaturally handling so good a subiect, had enclosed in the perfecte body of a man, little better than the vnperfect soule of a beast, like almost the imitating of an apish artificer, that in faire showes deciphers a formall substance, in curious cunning colours painting a Princely perfection, which satisfies the outward sence as the same, but cannot content the inward conceit, beeing but a bare show: So by euery outward appearance was he iudged well, till triall by experience to euery one proued him worse, but how great a corsiue it was to his careful Parents, I leaue it to the to consider whom experience hath taught to conceaue the like inconuenience, great griefe was it to his old father that had beene himselfe full of valour, to see his young sonne though able, yet vnfit for any such endeuour, which turned his hoped for rest to haplesse ruine, his aged mirth to angrie moane, and what so euer other content, into a contrarie conceit, to see his poore neighbours comfort their seruile liues with the sight of their forward Children, and hee their vnfortunate Lord wanting that redresse which those poore creatures in respect of him in such plentifull manner do daylie possesse. Thus grieuing to remember that which hee cannot forget and sorrie to haue so discontented an obiect to his aged eies, which he stil bewailed, though by no meanes his griefe could be healed, atlast learnes with patience to beare that which with paines he cannot amend, and instantly solicites the great Parlament of heauen, in whose dispose rests the estate of all creatures, that in their vnsearchable wisedome they woulde either open the eyes of his blinded soule, forged in the mistie vale of a cloudy ignorance, or els cut short the vnpleasant date of his wearie life, and so preuent the insuing ignominie of his future times: where wee must now leaue him a while in his follie, till the processe of our History bring vs thither againe. How two of King Arthurs Knights, ariued in Earle Cadors Court, and how Launcelot du Lake obtained the loue of faire Laura . During which time this young Ladie Daughter to this worthie Earle Cador , with the report of her matchles beautie, resounded in euery eare the welcome sounde of selfe pleasing loue, and thereby incited many aduentorous Princes, and matchles Knightes to forsake their farthest Countries with contented trauailes, to confirme with their eyes what had so filled their longing eares, as doth the neuer moouing pole drawe the adamantine touche of euerie steely compasse, still to direct their purpose to one point, so fared it here, whether declines the glance of al eies, the thoughts of all harts, and the aime of all actions, amongst whom arriued two Knightes of the honourable order of King Arthurs rounde Table, which was then so fullie furnished with a peareles troupe of couragious Cauileers, as iustly compared with all countries for like company, whose names were Sir Lancelot du-lake , and Sir Tristram du-Lions , two wonders for their worthines, matchles for their might, and for their curtesie exceeding compare: who amongst many millions of other braue Gallants there all for one purpose assembled, proudly opposes themselues against all approaching powers both of forraine and home borne foes that durst any way set themselues against her Soueraignetie, wherein they so valiantly behaued themselues, especiallie Sir Lancelot du-lake , whose vndaunted courage stroke such terror to the hearts of his foes, and won such fauour in the sight of his friends, as hee was generallie admired of all, but especiallie of Laura whose maiden heart beeing nowe touched with the pricke of affection, receaued so deepe an impression, as could neuer after be raced forth againe, and looke as there is no substance without his accident, no fire without his smoake, nor shadow without his body: so is there no loue how closely soeuer it bee shadowed, howe cunningly soeuer it bee dissembled, or how farre so euer remooued, but will by some meanes manifest it selfe, which in her proued true: for though her modest countenance blushing, ashamed at first to discouer the earnest affection of a so soone conquered louer, labored what in her lay still to repres her new mounting thoughts winged with the aspiring defence of a resiles louer: yet like fire the more it is kept downe the fiercer it riseth, floods the surer they are stopped, the sooner they ouerflow their bankes, and windes the greater that are their oppositions, the more furious are their forces: so fared it with the laboring heart of this lawles louer, sometimes determining to disclose with her tongue what lay so hid in her heart, and then she blushed for shame: then determined to smother it in obliuion; and then lookes she pale as fainting in dispaire: no minute but there entred into her minde the thought of a thousand doubtes, no doubt but redoubled her troublesome thoughtes, and both more and more doubtes, still increases the vnquenchable fire of her loue-thirsting soule. In that thinges by howe much they are hard to compasse, by so much are more worth being once compassed, gladly would she forget that which most shee delighteth to remember, faine would she shunne the snare that shee so willingly runneth into, and desires to winke at that shee doeth most desire: On the other side the worthie Knight dispairing of his good fortune, or els doubting his former force, grew with melancholly demeanor to spend halfe in dispaire, the dayes hee was wont to ouerpasse in the fulnes of desire, thinking eyther her affections were els where so throughly setled as could not be seuered, or his worth merriting demeanor deserued not so much as a fayre aspect from those powerfull plannets that guides the distressed estate of his sicklie soul. Looke as a weary wayfaring man, that tired with the toilsome labor of a tedious trauaile, dispayring with in his time to enioy the end of his iourney, and therefore vseth a speedier pace to perfourme his purpose, so fares it with the still troubled minde of this distressed Knight, who determining with himselfe how he might worke some meanes that might merrite mercie in the moodie censure of that disdainefull Iudge, who as he thought with a seuere sentence, would rather pronounce his death than promise his life, determined with himselfe how he might doe his endeuour to obtain her frendly fauour, which with long consultation hee thus concluded, namely to vndertake some hardie aduenture,  & dedicate his labour to her loue, and so if peraduenture the happie course of all helping heauens did so prosperously further his attempts, as that in his wearie plotted way, hee might but fortunately finde any worthie worke, whose conquest might deserue commendations, he fed himselfe with this hope, that the setled perswation of his sure loue confirmed by the dangerous endeuors of his longing life, perfectly presented to her memorie, by the atcheiuements of his worthie victorie, wold somwhat asswage the fury of her contemptuous conceit, & if not at the first win her, yet by little & little weare out the blot from her memorie, that detaines his loue from her minde: yet least his abrupt departure might be a greater cause of his disgrace, hee determined before hee went to paint forth that passion in the vnblushing lines of an amorous letter, which he could not disclose with the inforsiue words of a pittie moouing louer, & therfore sequestring himselfe from the resort of all company, hee thus in pittiful termes discouers his pure loue. Laura . naked name, for that thou dimmest all accents of fayre, and exceedest all Epethites of wit, the Poets thought Venus fayrest when she was naked, for that her beautie being sufficient of it selfe, scorned all the artificiall ornaments of rich apparrell: And so of thee, whose shaddow fairer than her substance, canst not bee fitted with any stile which thou doest not farre surmount: Looke downe vppon the seruile estate of a subiect slaue, that burning in the fierce flame of a neuer dying fire, prostrates his sillie soule at thy perfections shrine, so deepely imprinted in his hart, as but the comfort of thy pleasing selfe, no salue may ease his dying smart, onely thou hast hurt mee, and saue thy selfe none can heale mee. Ah doo not then triumph in my tragedie, because peculiarly from thee proceedes my remedie: nor bee not proude of thine Art, because thus piteouslie I implore thine aide, but with gentle fauour intertaine what with humble submission I intreat; and in requitall of that deede I will impose to my selfe a toile without rest, a trauell without end, and be a Conquerour without conquest, till my ceaselesse paine may deserue thy pittie, my toilesome trauell procure our truce, and the Trophies of my victorie requite some part of thy curtesie: Thus what I doe or what I suffer, what I presently possesse, or whatsoeuer I shall haue, I sacrifice at thy Altar, as propitiatorie offrings, and with the sad sighes of a sorrowfull hart cense thy sacred shrine, still intreating but this, that thou wouldest gently accept these rude lines of a rude Louer, and when discontented distance shall diuorce mee from thy Angelicall presence, thou wouldest at the least pittie my sorrow, though thou wilt not salue my sore. Thine whilst his owne Lancelot du Lake . This Letter he deliuered to a Page attendant vpon him, and whilst his seruant was gone to conuay it to her, himselfe went in to take his leaue of the Duke and the rest of his Noble friends and fellow Knights, where with a tedious discourse he discouers the cause of his so sodaine departure, vowing his deuoted seruice wholly to her honor, for whose loue he was now forced to leaue his Country, and seeke straunge Aduentures in forraine Coastes, whom they all were sorry to forgoe; yet seeing his importance, solemnely commits him and his intended enterprises to the good fortune of his still fauourable starres, except Sir Tristram du-Lyons , who for loue of him, and honourable care of his solemne order, would needes in despite of what euer contrarie perswations, accompany him in his course: whom whe Sir Lancelot had with many perswasiue arguments of forceable friendship diswaded from his indeuour, laying open vnto him the great cause of his dole full departure, which so deuoutly hee had vowed to performe, as also what discontent the absence of so many Knights would breed in their King and Captaine Arthur of England, whose royall furnished Table had ransacked the treasurie of the world for to supply his want: yet all in vaine stroue his wordes to disswade the other from his will, for not all the sugered wordes the others oratorie could afford, would anie whit diswade him from his former purpose: but in despite of what euer accident should ensue, he would needs accompany him in his iournie, vowing to sustaine what hardy stormes of abiect misfortune soeuer shoulde betide this thrice famous Lancelot hys vowed brother, that neuer should the burning heate of all springing sommer, nor the cruell colde of deade killing winter, weale nor woe, prosperous felicitie, nor aduerse extreamitie, sunder their soules whilst life did vphold their bodies: Whom when Lancelot saw that by no meanes he could diswade, hee gentlie admits his so long desired company, and with as many thankes accepts it, as the other with millions of offers had vrged it. How Lancelot du-Lake , and Tristram du-Lions ariued in the French Kings Court,  & how Lancelot du-Lake ouercame Roderigo Duke of Austria, and wonne the chiefest prizes in the Turnament, with other thinges that hapned. Thus these two aduenterers for honor, after they had solemnly tane their leaues, ioyfully set forwarde on their iournie,  & with a prosperous winde quickly cuts ouer the calme consenting Seas vnto the bordering rockes that walles their countrie France from the furie of the sometime surging Sea, and after their ariual, being proudly mounted vpon stately Steedes, stout of courage, able of limmes, and beauteous in show, attended onely with two Pages, who for that purpose they had appointed, takes vppon them the nearest and directest way that bordered vpon that coast where they lately landed, & spending the partching heate almost of a whole sommers day wandring through desart woods and manie vnpeopled plaines: till when the sweating Horses, of the weary sunne swiftly descending from the highest top of that heauenly hill, whence in his glory hee ouerlookes the mightiest mountaines that the earth affordes, & by their fiery tract summoned the silent night vp to her wearie watch, they began to looke out where they might espy any conuenient place for their purpose, where that night they might repose themselues to rest. At last after much curious search descending down into the pleasant bottome of a lowlie dale, where by chance ran from forth, the bowels of a mighty mountaine, a coole fresh spring, whose siluer current shadowed ouer with the heat expelling power of thicke tuffted trees, refreshes the increase of all adioyning vallies, who weary with wandering, and willing nothing more than such pleasure as there was plentifully promised, they alighted, and rayning all their horses to the big bowes of an aged neighboring Oake, gins with the fresh coole current of that plesant spring to alay the thirst of their hot stomackes, where they had not long solicited themselues in the shade after their great trauaile, but that an auncient Hermite inhabiting the desart roomes of that vnaccquainted corner, walking his accustomed iournie, by chaunce lightes vpon these wearie Knights, as they were cooling their weake limmes in the delightsome depth of that pleasant spring, who as ioyfull to see some creature of whome they might be better directed for the furderance of their affaires, as the other was willing to supplie their wants, with that poore prouision that himselfe wanted not, they with curteous salutation entertaine him, and hee curteously regreeting them with the like wishes of good lucke, requires what, whence, and who they were that had so farre wandred from the beaten wayes of those wide Desarts, to whome Lancelot with reuerent regard to his olde age, mildely answers that they were two Knights of the round Table, aduenterers in Armes, that had for the honor of their order, the credit of their countrie, & the loue of their loue worthy Ladyes, vndertaken to trauaile euen as far as sunne and seas, the one would giue them light, and the other afford them land. Then answered the old Hermite, are you happely come into these Confines: for not far from hence is the great Court of that mighty Monarch Lewes of France, that for the eternall memorie of all succeeding posterity, hath for the trie the strength, valour, & manhood that all the wide world can afford, appointed three Prises, the first a rich Armour curiouslye wrought, and richly bee deckt with precious stones, whose worth I cannot in words sufficiently set forth, with al the habilliaments thereunto belonging: the next a gorgeous Bedde curiously couered ouer with beaten gold, the fashion whereof farre exceedeth the worth of the massie worke, & all the rich adorninges thereunto appertaining: the last but best, faire Celestina his daughter and heire, whome I may well call the wonder of our world, whose beautie I will not labour to blase, least fayling in furdering that rare report, I should discredite my selfe in seeming curiously to commend that whose least moytie exceeds the highest reach of any earthly minde: There may you trie the trust you haue in your selues, & cut short the processe of your long pretended iournie: for that thither will resorte all the flowers of Cheualrie, that now flourishe ouer the face of the whole world: To morrow begins these triumphes, whether in good time you shall attaine, and for that this day well nigh done, will not afford you any further trauaile, please it you but to accept the turfie Cabbine of a homely Hermitage, and the simple supper of a sillie sequestered man, that hauing forsaken the vaine delights of his young dayes, hath betaken himselfe to the melanchollie remembrance of his after life: where to supplie your want of meate, you shall haue store of welcomes, and when the next morne shall bring glad tidings of the swift insuing sun, my selfe will directe you backe thither, from whence you far erred in declining your wearie iournie hither. Those two Knights curteously accepting the pleasure of this aged Hermite, contented themselues that night with the vnbolstred bed of a hard hurdle, & whe the liuely Larke a gladsome Harrald to the dawning day, gan with her siluer sounding note to discharge the melanchollie glooming night, hence haste these fame following aduenterers, to practise their forward indeuours, whome the olde Hermite duelie directes how they should againe get into the great traced way that directlie would carrie them to the Court, and so with manie praiers for their good speede, committeth them to the charge of him that carieth the care of all creatures: from whence they had not long trauailed recounting to themselues the happie chance of theyr speedie ariuall, but before them ouer an euen leuelled plaine, they might espie a wide beaten way, beeing full fraught with still approaching trauailers, that like a huge and mightie streame sending all his force to the sea, turnes all the course of their conueiance to one end, directs their iourney with al speed thither, supposing that to be the way that should lead them to the Court, and those trauailers wandring thither to be witnesses of the rare report of those deeds of Armes, wherof their old Hoast had the other night giuen such great commendations: where when they came, they found it to be euen so as they before imagined, and turning themselues that way whither pressed the streame of the increasing company: At last they ouertooke a mightie knight clad in habilliments of gold, such as was the Armour of Achilles , mounted on a blacke Barbarian Steede, that with his stately gate stoutly contendes to put downe his Master in pride, trapped with the rich pompe of Persian worke, curiously set with starres like Diamonds, that playing with the dazeling beames of the golden Sunne, dimes all the gazing eyes of the greedy beholders: before him rides richly mounted ten Esquiers bearing ten lustie Launces, and thus martching in as triumphant a state as euer did Caesar in the Romane streets, he comes to the Court, where were readie prepared all necessarie circumstances for such Knightly seruices: where before the Court vppon a plaine greene prouided for that purpose, the attendants appointed to bee erected a riche Pauillion of wealthie wrought Crimson silke, the ropes of the same colour wrought with siluer threds, and what els belonged to the supporting thereof was workemanlike wrought of the same mettall: there till the time that euery thing was ready for the Tilt, he reposes himselfe, where Lancelot longing to know and proue what was conteined with in all this Port, boldly gins inquire of an attendant vpon him what he should be, who answered that his Master was sonne and heire to the great Soldan of Babilon , drawne from his Country with the fame of faire Celestina , for whose loue hee came thither, to aduenture his life. Shortly after approaches the place another puisant Knight clad all in blacke, and he onely attended by a little Page that bore his Lance, erected a sable Tent of whom when he required to knowe, it was answered that he was called Triamore , sonne to the Duke of Brittaine , who for that hee had long affected this beauteous Prince (for whose sake all this was prouided) and shee with like affection answered his loue, seemed discontented in himselfe, that shee should be offered to any but himselfe. Next him came many other of whome were too long seuerally to dilate. But in the ende when all were ready, & euery thing for these stately triumphs orderly prouided, the Prizes brought forth, the Iudges set, and euery other appurtenance orderly appointed, the first that entred the Lists was Ferdinand heire to the Emperour of Almaine , mounted on a white Courser, that being artificially arrayed with cunning conceited wings, Peggasean-like deceaued the earnest eies of euery beholder, with a showe of fained flight. Against him prepares a Pagan, mightie of body, and cruell of countenance, who furiously meeting, like the fatall opposition of two Elements, shiuers their strong staues, whose splinters spinning in the emptie Aire, with their buzsing sound, tels the braue encounters of their furious fight from whome they flew, which course the Pagan borne from his Horse, and sore brused with the big bound of his vnweildie body, was conuayed from the place of their Chiualrie, almost past hope of recouery. In whose reuenge stepped sooth many mightie men, hardie and approued Knights whome this yong Prince with like furie, forced to fall with their fellowes: till at last like an angry Bore newly roused from his drowsie den, busling vp his big brissels, as aiming at an act of rigorous reuenge, steps foorth the proud Soldans sonne, and he pricking his Palfray to the end he might rigorosly root out the springing hope of this young Prince, clapping as heauie a Launce in his strong rest, as euer Aiax fore the walles of Troy , shiuered for the recouerie of their vnhappie losse: euen like the furious stroke of two strong streames, that with their tirrible thunder affrights the vnacustomed eares of their neare neighbours: meetes in the midest of the Lists the liuely Lordes, where with equall encounters they were both dung downe to the grounde, where Ferdinand his horse vnhappily falling vppon his Masters leg, so brused it, as hee was not able againe to recouer his saddle, but was conueyed thence: which when the young Soldan perceaued, stoutlye triumphing in his valiant victory gins saucely to proclaime aproud challenge against all Christians, for the reuenge of those fore punished Pagans: which vaine glorious vaunt so stirred vp the neuer vanquished valour of valiant Lancelot , as that addressing him to the fight, gins shew himselfe at the other ende of the Listes, as ready to recouer the almost lost Honor of his Christian Countrie, whome so soone as the Soldan had espied, spreading his winges like a greedy Goshauke houering ouer a fearefull couie of cowardly Fowles, gins addresse himselfe to his former demeanor: whome Lancelot with such courage encountred, as bearing downe both horse and man to the ground, astonished the vnchristned slaue with so fearefull a fall, as almost quite expelled the vitall spirits from his bigge swollen breasts: But yet feeling himselfe in so great a daunger of deuouring death, & out of all hope of the pittifull compassion of his eager enemie, beganne againe to rouse himselfe, and speedily preparing his strong fencing furniture, to assay the fortune of a furious fight, casting ouer his shoulder a large sheltering shield and brandishing in hys hand a keene edged Curtle-axe, gins nowe a foote to assayle him, that before on Horse backe hee did assault. When Lancelot perceaued it, he prouided himselfe for the like purpose, and couragiously encounters this harme hammering Heathen, where betwixt them againe beganne a farre more fiercer fray on foote, then was the cruell encounters before with their Horse, which continuing very long on both sides confirmed with the fierce falles of their vnwildie weapons, makes at length Sir Lancelot du-Lakes armes (weakned with the issue of much blood, that the Pagan had spilt with his blowes) almost to faile of his former forces, which beeing espied of the Christians, and especially of the King, who aboue all other, despised a Pagan should possesse so Princely a Prize, as they had there prouided, gins euery where to enquire of that Knight, on whose strength almost nowe depended their whole estate, to whom at length word was brought that it was a Knight of King Arthurs round Table, whose name was Sir Lancelot du-Lake , to whome all the Confines of Christendome hardly in Chiualrie afforded a fellow: which stroke such a dismall dumpe into the moodie minde of this discontented King, to see the Champion of Christendome so neere vanquished, vnder the pittilesse power of a most hellish heathen, as almost driues the bright and Rosiall colour from his afore well coloured Cheekes. Till when this still triumphant Knight shakeing himselfe as from a sluggish slumber, reaches at the Pagan with such power, as that at one blow with his well tempered sword, hee quite cuts a sunder the strong turret that hemmed in his head, & settling further downe to his harmefull head, batters a sunder the siluer wall that shieldes the principall partes of soule seruing sence, and the rest remayning remnants of that little world, wanting the direction of their greatest guide, altogether faile any further to fence their fainting fellowes from his battring blowes, which sight bred no small content to the almost sickly soule of the King, who expected nothing lesse then the so speedy death of his spitefull foe, who beeing by the conquered disarmed of his rich habilliaments, was by the rest of his company quickly conuaied to his curions Tent, and all his attendants sent home with sorrow, that whilome flourished in such hope for felicitie. After this approached many other Knights to trie their fortunes in that fight: from whence Sir Tristram du-Lions won the honor of that day, still working for greater glorie with more manlike demeanor: Till when the nights blacke shadow, gins set an end to that dayes bright showes, and so euery one expecting the end of their aduentures, thronged to heare the iust iudgement of that sure censuring Senate, forepointed by the King to determine of this doubt, who with one assent after they had highly commended the many valerous deedes of diuers couragious Cauileers, did aboue all wholly attribute the honor of that dayes dutie to Sir Lancelot du-Lake , as one that had best deserued it of them all, and so putting him to the King, at whose hands he was to receaue this renowned, reward: he there with no lesse pleasure to heare the murmering noyse of the muttering multitud, buzsing the report of his valerous deedes: then with the hope of those rich rewardes appointed for the Conquerours meed, receaued at his Kingly hands al those robes, of more than estimable estate, and whatsoeuer by due was fitting his desert. Amongst which was that more than faire Celestina , for whom rather than the rest was assembled such and so many mightie men, euen from the furthiest Coasts of al the Esterne Kingdomes to the Westerne Iles, bound vp in the Oceans bosome: but for that himselfe had before setled his seruice, to honour that Saint whose Idea grauen with the Diamond points of Christall caruing eyes, in the impregnable table of his secrert heart, whence no furie of newe assaulting force, can euer wash it away, determines in this to winne to himselfe the report of more worth, than by his former acts he had fully atchieued: and therefore with many thankes to his Maiestie, receauing the rewardes of his honour, which nowe lay all in hys power to dispose after some conference, such as to like affaires are most fit, calling for Sir Tryamore , of whome we before told you, that he was sonne & heire to the Brittaine Duke, gins thus discourse his honorable intent. Since quoth he the vnmerited mercy of euer helping heauen, from the great attemptes of many more mightier than my selfe, hath attributed the honour of this day to the vndeserued dutie of my deedse: By the censure of which sentence, I am to enioy the possession of all this pleasure, whose especiall good, rests in the glorie of this more than a Goddesse: yet since my minde not cappiable of her loues impression, because alrerady it retaineth the beautie of another, in such sure possession, as that no time can trie it, no beutie blot it, nor other loue with languishment lauish it away, to thee will I giue what I might by right take away, and so gaine more honour by the voluntary release of her loue to thee, then I should get fame by the forceable detayning of her affections to my selfe: In which I shall binde thy loue to me, as to a friend, her liking as to a fauorer of her fortunes, and further the faire fruite of a yet scarce blooming bud, in the blessed bosome of anothers beautie; & so deliuering her freely ouer to Sir Triamore , twixt whome there had beene afore such settled likeing of likely loue, to the Kinges great content, the louers full consent, and his owne more furthered intent, he disposed of the greatest part of his prize: the other seueral rewardes he determined to send ouer into England to present to his Laura : for whose conueyance he adressed a trustie Esquire of his owne, that from a childe had followed him in all hys actions of honor: where awhile we must leaue him to his further aduentures, and prosecute the presentment of his Prize to his peareles Parramour, which by his Page was quickly performed: who flying with the fauorable fortune of well wishing windes, in shorter space than commonly acompanieth such tired trauellers, ariued in England at the olde Earle Cadors Court, where was then a Royal assembly of Courtlike company: to whom when it was knowne that there was arriued one ready to tell straunge tydings of the admirable atchiuements of their late fortune finding friends, assembled all to gether to heare those welcome wordes into the Earles great Hall: where both himselfe, his daughter and his vnseemely sonne, as also the rest of that Royall resort orderlie placed with attentiue diligece, quieted themselues to heare expressed these straunge exploits: to whose presence did prease a comely Esquire attended by a drudging Dwarffe that was loaded with a rich Armour, who after he had in order rendred deseruing duty to euery seuerall assemblant, thus deliuered hys message. Great Earle to whose honor wholly submites it selfe the whole worth of his worke, that from the fierce furie of Alians armes hath brauely born away these Princely rewards. Grant pardo to my rash resort, and giue licence to my truth telling tonge in few wordes to disclose the especial cause of my hastie comming: and then with the honorable accidents of these worth worthie wars, gins he to paint forth the praises of that famous fight: wherein from the stil flowing force of many furious foes, had his matchles master brauely borne away the home brought booties: Which tale hee so furnished with fitting Epethites, and true titles of aduenterous valour, as neuer sung the sweet tuned tongue of heauenly Tullie in the famous Capitoll of still renowmed Roome, with more applausiue speeches of a truth vrging tale, extolling the eternized honor of those thrice famous aduenterours with the heauen scaling stile of a more than earthly Oration: and then with the blacke tragicke tunes of strange misfortune, such as was the Art framed action of that Thracian Knight, when he described to doleful Dido the true story of Troys estate: To whose powerfull speech listned the attentiue eare of that pitty mouing Prince of whom we before told, whe the happy heauens dispersing now the sable vale of sad faced follie, that so long in the darke dungeon of ignominy, had lockt vp the happines of his after hopes, being now able in himselfe to see, that which before in another he could not discerne, euen as the Eagle after her age casts her bill, the Serpent slides off his skin, or the wanton Bucke his harmles head: So he to the great admiration of all those worthy witnesses, suddainely starting at the strange tale of this well spoken Page, griuouslie bewailed the lucklesse date of his forespent dayes that had so sluggishly ouer slipt the young yeares of his youthfull iollitie in the fabling fancies of childish follie: wherein hee neyther had discharged the duty of a sonne, satisfied the honour owing to hys countries seruice, nor won the least part of that worth, that by due desert he saw generally attributed to many men of far meaner byrth, & therefore nowe turning his former foolish demeanors to more Princely promising endeuours, he suddainelie sollicited his old sorrow tyred sire, that hee would thus far further his intent, as to graunt him leaue a while to forsake his natiue soyle, and learne thus to aduenture for honor in far forraine lands, whose instant intreatie not brooking the deferring of further delay, earnestly vrged his now more fortunate Father to further so his forward Sonne, as that presently prouiding all such necessaries as to him was most needefull, without any more meanes made for his bootlesse abode, fitly furnished him in euery point for such a purpose: where euery necessary being prouided, and himselfe now readie to depart, blessed with the many praiers of hys ioyfull father to see hys forward sonne recouered from the helples horror of darke ignorauce, to the approuing prowesse of Princely pusance, and with the well willing wishes of all his friendly fauorites, he departs his home to seeke his so long lost glorie abroad. Meane while whilest thus Lancelot had sent ouer to hys Mistris the afore named fauors, speedy preparation was prouided in Fraunce for the solemnezing of this Royall marriage betwixt Sir Triamore , and faire Celestina : which for that his father then resident vpon his Dukedome, was desirous to content his old conceit with the sight of his sonnes marriage: Syr Triamore earnestly intreated of the King, that he would so farre further his olde fathers request, as to licence their departure home into Brittanie , whereto the old King willingly condiscended and most Royally furnished this their ioyfull iourney: whither being attended with sir Lancelot du Lake , and sir Tristram du Lions , besides many other aswell valiant Knights as beauty brauing Dames, drawen out from the chiefest choice of all that Countrie, merrily sets forward on their way. In the meane time the Soldan hearing of the disgraced death of his sonne, and certefied by some of his espials, of the pretended purpose of these Christian Princes were the onely sharers of that glorie, gins presently to leuy what forces his Countrie in so short a time was able to lend, and imbarking with all speede his Armie, in short time landed all his men vppon the vnhappy Coast of Britanie , where orderly incamping themselues, about the warlike walls of that strong defended Towne, where the Duke with all his attendants kept then a puisant Court for the welcomming of his sonne and his beauteous Bride; cutting off all those conueying passages, that leades any way to their neighbour compassing Confines, remoouing all semblance of succour from their longing sight: And being further certefied of the neere approach of that triumphant troope of valiant Uictors, that fearing nothing lesse than such trothlesse treason, weares out their iourney with such ioy, as experience in farre meaner mens matters proues passing all other pleasure. Whose purpose the subtle Soldan purposing to preuent, in an old ouergrowne wood, scituate some foure miles from the Citie, slily insconses a great Scout both of horse and foote: who as soone as they had encompassed this carelesse company within their ill intending Armes, rudely rusht out vpon them: who for because their comming somewhat too sudden in with the other Knights, could hardly prouide to resist their foreplotted purpose, and the numbers so far different, as scarcely might they afford one Christian to twenty Pagans, whereby they were forced to a furious fight: In which saue onely Lancelot, Tristram , and Triamore all were slaine, and Celestina maugre all their force, conueyed away in the fight. Which when they perceaued, like three inraged Lions, amidst the troopes of the Forrests feareful inhabitants, prayes vppon the cursed carkases of these vnchrissened Curres, till when no more fuell was left for their fire, no remainder whereon they might worke their further reuenge, nor any other subiect for their conquering swords, hope of recouery was past, because their numbers were too great; the furie of further fight in vaine, because themselues were too weake; and being desperate almost, what way to take to find reliefe. Long time they spent in disputing what were best to doo in this extreame danger, themselues being sore wounded with the many blowes of their ouer numbred foes, their Armour brused with the oft falling forces of their Foe- mens swords, and their weapens almost all broken in this barbarous battell, incites to their sadde thoughts what secure meanes they might seeke for their best safegard. Being thus left destitute welnigh of all defence, they wandred vp and downe the vntrodden wayes of those wast woods, one reciting this, another inditing that, and the third misliking both; till when the comfortlesse couering of the sad faced night, gins hide away the life ioying sight of the lightsome day, when these sorrowfull sighing soules wandring in the vnpeopled paths of these wide woods, spent all that tedious night in tyred trauels, sometimes straying this way, and then stepping that way againe, till the sorrow of their sower chance had almost quite taken away the ready remembrance of them selues. At last as euery sorrowe hath an ende, so had this long night, and the pleasant spring of the next insuing day gins somewhat to cheare vp their troubled mindes from the cruell cares of their ouer passed paines, when determining with themselues to make speedy post to euery seueral Christian Kingdome, and from thence to leuy such powers of people, as should perforce make this heathen Hel-hound again to render vp to their handes this beauty staining Bride, whom he had so cowardly caught away: Till wandring together downe the pleasant side of a summer showing hill they might espy beneath in the broade bottome of a dismall dale a great worne way, yet not such as accustomably are the conueyances of peopled beaten pathes, but as it were the fatall footsteps of some mighty Monster that with his ill fauored feete had poysoned the sprouting springes of that pleasant Plaine. Which after they had a long time followed, prying euery way what this wonder should import: At last they a farre off might heare the vnaccustomed cryes (as it should seeme) of some tormented soule, that beeing grieuously afflicted with some straunge torments, made those ruthfull moanes to mooue the compassionate mindes of some wayfaring wanderer to deliuer her from that great miserie: which they like two lost fellowes in a great growne woode, that with the resounding Ecchoes of theyr lowde scriking cries, brings themselues after long search together againe, who listning from what likeliest place this same might growe, at last vnder the darke shade of a sheltring Cipresse that ouerhung the mouth of a craggie Caue, he went out (as it should seeme) of the big body of a ruinous Rocke, they might perfectly perceiue the same to proceede: Whither poasting in all hast, striuing who should stand in most sted for the release of this losse (as they supposed) rudely they together ran downe without regard into this darke Denne, who as soone as they were in, from out the darke couert of another cabbining Caue stept foorth a mightie Monster, framed with the deceitfull face of a faire woman, but the big body of a subtill Serpent, whose poyson swolne bowelles bearing the breadth of a mighty Tunne, was supported with the ioyntles legs of a Castle carrying Elephant, hands had she in forme like a man, but in the substace of her frame more than a monster, a tayle that Serpent like catcheth in the vnprouided trauailers, her backe strongly fenced with broad buckling scales, that proudly opposes it selfe gainst the toughest steele, her force more than could bee comprehended within the reach of a reasonable conceit: For she (after her Crokadile complaints she had) drawing the harmelesse Knight into that subtill snare, quickly rootes vp against the mouth of the hole a mightie stone, which the force of many men could not els remooue, and so locking in these well meaning men within the compasse of her loathsome Denne, shee leaues them to the comfortlesse consort of their nowe almost curelesse cares. How Chinon after his transformation from his foolishnes, betooke himselfe to seek for forraine aduentures, and after how hee encountred Sir Lancelot , and Sir Tristram in a Forrest, where hapned a straunge aduenture, and how Chinon pulled a sword from an inchaunted Rocke of stone. By this had Chinon crossed the Seas out of his owne countrie, and ariued in Fraunce where hee neuer came before, and himselfe yet ignorant in the course of trauaile, wandred vp  & downe a long time, seeking some worthy work wheron he might make triall of his strength. But for that the desolate Coasts bordering vpon the sea side, afforded no matter for his manly courage, after he had there spent some fewe dayes, he takes a new course of trauell ouer the vntrodden hilles into the bosome of the next bounding Country. Which weary way, for that his horse being young and not yet vsed to the hard hap of aduentures himselfe, euen as a childe that newe sprung from his cradle, can hardly counteruail the worlds weary works; so fared it with this new Knight, who was greedy of glorie, but vnfit to finde it: yet hoping of better hap, drawes out his iourney ouer many high hilles, and then settles hee downe into the melancholly shade of deepe darkened valleys, wher before neuer footed any earthly creature, saue foule Serpents, no noyse but the sorrowfull sound of the ill boading Owle; no light saue the glimmering of a little beame that shining through the transparant leaues of blacke Cypresse boughes showed him some comfort amidst this more than the shadow of death: No meate could hee come by, saue such as that vnfruitful earth did afford, nor drinke saue the troubled streames of an vnpleasant spring, that mixed with the vnholsome sorts of deade dropping leaues full of the filthy slime of sluggish Toades, and many such vnholsome creatures: his Bedde the ouergrowne mosse vpon the side of the mountaine; his pillowe the toppe of an vneuen stone; his couering nothing saue the ouershadowing bowes of age trembling trees; his nightly sleepes often affrighted with the hissing of many foule snaks, vnacustomable antomes to his eares: yet as he that will trauell vpon the sea, must addresse himselfe to abide the trouble of euery storme; hee that will enioy the sweet content of felicitie, must needes vndergo all the hard haps of enuious aduersitie: so he that wil in this spacious world seeke the aduantage of Honour, must beare base direction of vnseemely misfortune. So this yong Prince after hee had long time wandred thus without the direction of any way, at length espies a far off a chalkie path, scaling the top of a high hill, whether with much adoe at length he came vnto, and after he had long time climed vpo the side of this mount, at length with many wearie steps he attains the toppe: from whose height hee might againe looke backe at his ouerspent iourney: following a longe while the broad tract of that beaten way, presentlie he came to a narrow cut of passage out of the side of a flintie Rocke, where the high hill steepe ore his head, troubles the course of the winde wandring cloudes, beneath the lowlie bottome of a blacke dismall Dale, filled with the furious force of aspyring springs, that working from the wombe of the sea, euen vnto the highest toppe of that mightie Promontany, breaks out againe, and with a fierce fall downe into the dismall Dales, makes such a hidious noyse: as when the vnbridled force of the ouerflowing sea breakes downe the boundes of his neighboring bankes, and drownes all the nere placed plaines, with his euerworking waters: Yet Chinon still hoping that after showers, at length would come a sunne; after woes, weale; & after these hard passages pleasanter plaines; with as much patience as hee could, ouergoes this griefe he had, and gins at last to see the farther side of his wearie way: from whence looking downe, hee might espie a more pleasant dale, whether descending by a downe falling path that went into the bottome of a Hill he gladly at length attained, and there in a more fresher and pleasanter streame than before of a long time hee had met withall: hee some what refreshes himselfe, and beeing content with such fruit as that soyle did afforde him, hee goes forwarde on hys iournie, still searching for that hee coulde not finde: At last he came as hee thought to the mouth of some Caue that was fullie filled vp with the stronge bulke of a mightie bigge stone, whose hugenesse was such as could not be remooued by the might of manie men, where in olde almost outworne letters, were these lines ingrauen. In prison here a puisant wight, Betraied by cunning craft now lies: Whence no man but a maiden Knight, Can free him from his miseries. Whose first tried valour must assay, To rid this wretched man away. Which when he had red and curiously considered, gins to resolue with himself, to assay whether his fortune should bee so good as to performe this seruice, where looking round about for him that did heere in a peremptorie painted challenge keepe the passage of that place, where this Knight whereof mention was there made, is by subtiltie inclosed, at last sodainelie, but from whence he saw not, there was a huge deformed Monster, such as before he seldenie or neuer had seene, whose shape neyther imported the proportion of man nor beast, but a mixture of them both: from foorth the furnace of whose fierie bellie, issues like the ashes of Aetna , many cloudie mists of darke smoke, that almost smoothered this famous follower of hardy deedes before he began the fight, and in this Fogge armed with the bulke of a yong springing Oake, the fell force of whose fall, had beene sufficient to haue ground him a sunder, gins vnawares to assaile him: which when he perceaued, nimbly leaping backe to eschue the heauy stroke, prepared in as short space as he could to prouide himselfe for this fray, but ere he could be in euery point armed, gins againe this monster the second time to assault him, which he in the best sort he could deuise, sought meanes to escape, for to vndergoe it he could not: and then nimbly conueying himselfe within the ende of his mighty weapon, with his well tempered sworde gins assay to worke vppon the Monster, but all in vaine, for so strongly was it euery where buckled with insconsing scales, as no more entrance was affoorded for his sword, then if he had stroken vppon the hard face of a flinty Rocke, when the subtle serpent with a sodaine turne gaue the Knight such a heauy blowe with the poysoned weight of her strong tayle, as perforce beat him downe to the grounde, and almost banished the breath from his body: But hee mindfull of what hee had in hande, to encounter so vnnaturall an enemie; long lyes not in that case, but nimbly rousing vp himselfe againe, gins freshly to assaile his enemie: who still threatning him with the bigg blowes of his vnwieldy weapon, puts him euery way to his shift how he might best shun them. At last spying a fit oportunitie, he with his sword indeuoured to cut asunder her vnacustomed kinde of weapon, which in short time he performed, so that now free meanes he had for to assay what he could do vppon her vnwieldy body: But all his labour was lost, for so safely was shee garded from all entrance, as not the keenest steele the smoakie Cyclops forged for the mighty God of wrathfull warre, could euer enter into her: when hee troubled at once with two illes, the furious force of her serpentine taile, which now prooues her best weapon, and the brimstone flaming which still issued out at the Furnace of her fiery mouth. At the last after much labour, the weary Knight tyred almost with this tedious toyle, gins somewhat to returne backe, to the end he might recouer againe his nie lost breath: which flight for that the Serpent did not with such eager force pursue, as she was wont to doe in the beginning of their fight, hee made longer stay to recouer thereby better strength, & then as two furious fighting Stagges that fetching a farre flight, thereby to encounter with more force, begins againe these new olde enuies and with their furious blowes so plagued one another, as if the opposition of two great Armies had sent the noyse of their battering Armes from euery resounding eccho: till at length after the many fierce assaults of the furious Knight, hys foyled enemie in a sudden as she came, vanishes away, which he suspecting but to be some diuelish deuise, with an intent to set vpon him againe at vnawares, gins circumspectly to prie into euery corner, to the end he might be sure that no intrapping ambushes of her hobgoblin companions, might priuily lurk to insnare his life: when vnwares he perceaued the mighty stone so meruailously laid ouer the Caue of it selfe to roule away, and from foorth the hole issues out three goodly Knights, two whereof he knew, for hys Countrymen and olde acquaintance: but the thirde which was a stranger he neuer saw before, these wer they of whome we said afore were by the subtill shift of a deceauing Syren, cunningly compassed in that Caue: where when Syr Lancelot du Lake and hys fellow Tristram saw Chinon , that at their departure from England they left foolish in their friendes, & his fathers house, miraculously transformed to a valiant Knight, and so luckily there ariued, for their reliefe: no maruaile if with admiration, theyr woondering wittes were drawne into a laborinth of such deepe conceites, how this might come to passe; that beeing amazed as were those stone turned people, which gazing vppon Gorgons heade, coulde hardly beleeue in their mindes, what was so liuely presented to their eyes, till Chinon perceiuing their passion, gins thus to waken them from their drowsie and sluggishe dreame. Fellowes in Armes (quoth hee) the very reporte of whose valour hath from the heauy weight of obscure follie, rowsed my deade drooping thoughtes to the liuely remembrance of a higher mounting mind, not happier shall you be in this your release, than I in bringing you reliefe; in that the succession of after growing ages, shall eternize my name for the opening of this worse than hellish mouth, and for the vanquishing of that more than miraculous Monster, for that by the one I againe restored to the world two such valiant Knights: and by the other, rid them of a pestilent plague. Stand not in a maze, for I am the man that lately you left in a world of follie, but now by the power of prouident heauen, raised from that deiection. At last Lancelot (ouercloied with ioy to see him thus fortunate, that whilome was so foolish) regreetes his good hap with many ioyfull wordes, such as commonlie passe betwixt long parted friends at their vnexpected meeting, and then sir Tristram likewise salutes hys honorable aduenture, with the many great thankes and good wishes of like future good fortune: then sir Triamore for that he himselfe altogether vnacquainted with Chinon , although hee had often heard hys friendes and then followers in Armes, with mickle griefe to relate the wofull case wherein they left such a Prince, as there they named in England : yet hee begins to enquire of sir Lancelot the whole passed storie of hys friendes estate, who with ioy repeating, what oft with sorrow hee had seene performed: gins certefie him in euery point according to hs asking, which when sir Triamore vnderstoode that hee was a Knight of comely carriage and curteous demeanor, he forthwith with many gentle greetings and more thankes to heauen and him for their happy deliuerie, vowed vnto him all the honor of his actions: Who long professing kindly friendshippe and duteous indeuor, to deserue this more then common curtesie, they were presented with a troope of Fairies; mongst whome was Oboram there King, who especially choosing Chinon from the rest, began with many wordes of woonder to commend his Cheualry, for that last being his first Combate, he had so valiantly behaued himself, as had all the chiefe choise of powerfull Christendome stroue with themselues to haue exceeded his worth, their Forces all ioyned in one, in respect of him had beene none: And then turning to the rest of the Knights, tolde them that the Monster by whose deuise they were there deceaued, was no other than himselfe, who for the desire he had to approue the Prowesse of this newe come Knight, vndertooke that shape, in requitall of which wrong he had prouided a costly sword, which by his Art was fastned within the close binding body of a strong Rocke, and he of them that should stoutly pull it out, should for his paines inioy a Iewell of rich price: which sword was artificially framed for Iulius Caesar , by the cunning craft of a mighty Magitian, inhabiting within the desolate places of those darke vallies, and for that it so pleased the great Director of all mens dealinges, that that worke should come to naught, for that the valiant Romane was before the perfection thereof vnluckily slaine in the Senate, hee had closely reserued it to another vse: But who that should be of al them foure, (of which by necessity must needs bee one) that as yet was not knowne to himselfe, and then leading them through the darke shades of many light lacking vaultes, shewing them the seacrets of his close couched Kingdome, bound vp within the bowels of the earth: whether when they were a little descended, they might partly see armies of many little Elues come posting towards him, as speciall attendants on his traine, whose busie fingers woulde gladly haue beene pinching theyr wearie legges for higher they coulde not reach: but that forbidden by the great charge of their commaunding King, they durst not aduenture it againe, Thus after their long walke in those close kept countries, hee brought them at length into a broade vale, in midst whereof was grauen vp a mighty ragged Rocke, wherein was a faire fashioned sword curiously contriued of many sundry mettals, which should seeme by some or other meanes to haue beene stroken thereinto, where this fairie King told them they were all to approue their forces at the pulling of it, and he whose lot it should be to win it, for his pains should alwaies were it, whose temperature was so good as would clearely cut a sunder whateuer, stone, mettall, or any harder obiect was opposed against it, the vertue this, that whosoeuer wore it shoulde neuer be assailed by base crosbiting of anie slie deceitful Inchanter. And thus with many words extolling the excellencie of the thing, and promising good fortune to them whosoeuer should attaine it. Hee first appoints Syr Lancelot , who as greedie of this goodly weapon, as a hungrie hauke of her pray, stoutly steps foorth, and laying hold of the sword with a maine force, offering to vnsheath it, could nothing at all remoue it. The next was sir Tristram , and he also offering to doe his endeuour therein was also at the first expelled: Next him steps Triamore , but his force as feeble as the rest let stand still that for which they also stroue: till Chinon taking sure hold vpon the hilt, with one hand did more than they were able to effect with all their power: which when he had done, brandishing it about hys head, as promising therewith to worke some extraordinarie wonders, he straight waies by Oborams direction was presented with a rich Armour, and all necessarie furniture thereunto belonging, borne by two little Elues, which he straight put on, and then girding himselfe with his new got sword, makes all possibe speede to returne as one longing to approue what those rich habilliments did promise: to whome Oboram after a long oration of much prefiguring valour and valiant exploytes by him to bee performed, with many offered assurances of what readie helpe rested in his power to performe, whereof quoth he thou shalt ere long stand in need: giues him further, a faire shield, composed by the cunning of a famous Inchantres: wherein was in rich mettall curiouslye engrauen a statelye flintie Rocke, shiuered in peeces by the power of a naked man, vnder which in letters of gold was ingrauen this posie, Nihil difficile , & appointing him a Page of his owne bringing vp, a little ill fauored Eluish Dwarffe, but trusty at all assayes, commits him to the keeping of good fauoring fortune, till time and his necessity shall againe bring them together. How Chinon and Triamore redeemed Celestina from the Soldan of Babilon , after a most strange maner, with other Noble atchiuementes that they performed in the same exploit. Thus in a sodaine trance they being back againe conueyed to the place whence he first led them: where they then beginne to acquaint him with all the manner of their triumph in France, the losse of their Lady, the victory of the Pagan, & what els ill hap had betyded them since theyr departure from the King of Frances Court, which tragick tale so whetted the longing lust of this pearelesse Prince, to reuenge the iniuries of those his so happy met mates, as that he straight gins to deuise how hee might best worke some speedy meanes for her deliliuerie, that nowe was closelie pent vp in delights, farre more worse vnto her than darke Dungeons: which with many hammering plots: At length hee thus purposed to bring to passe. Thou Triamore quoth hee, for that by thy default this Lady so vnluckely lost her libertie, shalt venture with me thus to recouer her, and these my friendes shall in a nother sort employ themselues, as I will direct them: then seeing thy yeares are yet young, thy face louely, and euery well fashioned part of thy body fit to further our intent, thou shalt take vpo thee the shape of some inchantres, I & my dwarffe trimmed vp in other apparrell will attend vppon thee as dilligent seruants which thou shalt pretend thou imployest in such secret affaires, as none saue such simple slaues, will abide to beare: where thou shalt vndertake to procure the likeing of faire Celestina , to affect him which for that no welcommer newes can come to his besotted minde, than the sound of such seruice, he will easily condiscend to doe any thing that thou shalt direct him to: which beeing done, leaue the rest to my disposition, and in the meane time these my ancient friends shall whilest we worke within, attende here without, and the next night when the Queene of shades gins in her quiet rule to dimme the glimering show of lesser lights, in some secret place, that thou (for that the best cannot direct vs in this cuntrie) shalt appoint to attend our comming: where for the next dayes arise we will worke a deede of such worth, as shall eternize our honour in all ages, and make vnborne Children hereafter to repeat what exceeding valour, we for our Christian Countrie (ouerloaden with the hatefull burden of barbarous Pagans) performed, and then instructing them throughly in euery point of his purpose, and carefully prouiding to take away euery obstacle of aduerse suspition, that might any waies be a hindrance to their well intended purpose, they meeting all againe on their sturdie Steedes rides foorth, till they came neare to the place whereas the Pagan with all his Armie lay, and there in the same place wherby treason they were surprised, staies Lancelot and Tristram in a thicke Castell, couered ouer with thicke leaued hollie, where they might easy shrowd themselues from the sight of all passengers: whilest Chinon; Triamore , & hys Dwarffe sets boldly forward to execute the fore plotted purpose: who comming into the Campe, made it straight knowne to some of the Soldans nearest attendantes what they were: Triamore pretending himselfe to be (as afore we told) an Inchauntresse, that was come from far, to further the loue of the great Soldan to faire Celestina : Which newes when it was told him, sounded no lesse pleasant in hys eares than Aue Caesar at his Coronation: where charging them straight to be brought to hys presence, he gins to question with Triamore of his skill, posing him in the relation of kings past, as how, when, and where he first surprised that Lady: which Triamore for that himselfe was an vnfortunate acter in that dolefull Tragedy could in euery point fitly answere him: which the Pagan simply attributing to hys great skill, giues thankes to hys gods that in so good time had thither directed the skilfull Inchantresse, by whose meanes he hoped not onely to enioy hys new foyles loue: but also to performe such prodigious exployts, as should redound to the eternal dishonour of all Christian Countries, and then begins to question with him about the recouerie of his loue. Triamore with a fine forged tale, gins tell him that if he would but practise such meanes as he should appoint, he would so Inchaunt the louely minde of that fayre Christian Princesse to affect hym, as mauger al the mallice of whatsoeuer opposing power, she should forsake father and friends, kinsfolks and Countrie, & only bind herselfe to tarrie with him. Which soule pleasing sound, did ring such sweete musicke in his rude eares, as that he with all speede willed her but to determine what was herein to bee done, and he with asmuch expedition would fully effect, if it were to the losse euen of halfe his Kingdome. Then quoth Triamore , this night hath Cinthia filled fullie vp her emptie hornes, whose fauorable aspects will fitly futher our purpose: when therefore the silent night hath shut the eyes of euery watchfull creature, thou, thy loue, and my selfe, must by some such meanes as thou shalt best appoint, be conueyed secretly from the Campe into the bosome of a neare bordering wood, where wee may clearely see all the coarse of the ceasles frames of neuer resting heauen: where I with my inuocations, and forcesiue Magick spels, will so Inchaunt the minde of thy beauteous loue, as hence foorth shee shall neuer affect any other saue thy selfe, and then pretending to prepare such necessarie furniture as should fit her purpose, she desired that her selfe and her seruants might a while bee remooued into some secret place, where they might prouide all thinges fit for their purpose, and where they might haue some speech with the Damsel, which was speedily done: for a secret seruant nerely belong-to the Soldan, was appointed to direct them: where by themselues they had free talk with faire Celestina : to whome Triamore begins to relate al that had hapned them since their inforcesiue departure, with the happie aduenture of Chinon for their deliuerie, and what els had befallen them, in that trauel: and then comforts her with the hope of escape, by theyr thus plotted purpose: where long they were repeting their ouerpassed paines and reioycing in their hoped happines, till time approached of their departure: when the Soldan not vnmindefull of this matter, sent to the Sorcerer to see if all thinges were readie for their purpose: which affirmed that shee was orderly prouided. At last the latest houre is come, when he calling together all the chiefest of his Captaines & acquaints them with the cause which tended so much to the furtherance of his desire, & intreating the most of them that they would walke with him out into the next adioyning wood to be witnesses of this work: to whom they willingly condescended, & then gathering themselues together after the watch was set, they secretly departed: where the Soldan stil thinking on the inioying of his loue, neuer dreampt of any pretended treason that might thereby insue, but greedily catching like a foolish fish at the golden baite, they still followe on theyr way, till they were come to the place where Lancelot , and Tristram lay hid: where Chinon casting off his disfiguring maske, begins now to shew himselfe in his owne likenes, and with a watch word calling for his fellowes, brauely sets vpon these their enemies: where in short time they had sent to hell all the rest, saue the Soldan himselfe, and taking him prisoner, carries him away bounde: when Triamore now once againe reuelling in the treasury of his loue: gins with all humble submission, attribute to the honour of Chinon all the fore passed proofe of this their fortunate seruice which they had performed. But Celestina that nowe like the Thracian Damosell returned with the Lorde of her loue from the dismall Gates of Hell, beginnes with the teares of true ioy to prostrate her selfe at his honorable feete, whose force had againe restored her from the tedious slauerie of loathsome captiuitie, to the pleasant presence of life feeding libertie, vowing deuoted seruice for this her second life: But Chinon disdayning that the foule faced earth shoulde enioy so much as a touch of her heauenly hew, with gentle intreatie rayses her vp, and thus replied to her suppliant speech. Fairer quoth he than is the common composition of earthly creatures, and therfore of more worth than millions, if I haue ought done in this that hath bred thy content, it is no more than beseemeth the dutie of my degree: Then doe not thus attribute more honor for my meede, than is due by deserts to my deed: more is thy smile towards the reward of a well deseruing worke, than the rich rewards of many millions of an others vowes, more pleasant is the sight of an houres sunne, than the show of twenty shadowed daies: but thy sight exceeding the brightest shining sunne, that day is at the mid dayes height the pearcing beames of euery bright eyes sight, more welcome to vs, than day to the wearie watch, or the repose of a quiet Inne to a tyred trauailer, gracest our paines with thy presence. More worth is his worke that rifles in the rich bowels of the gold growne earth, than hee that drudges in the bottome of a dunghill ditch, and yet the last labor is more than the first: but that the subiect exceeding in worth, excels the reward of his work more than the trauaile graces the thing: but the worth of the subiect dignifies the desert of the deede, whereby our credit by thee is maintayned, and not thy matchles selfe by our might magnified. Looke on hym for thy loue aduentured his life, and the rewarde of my paynes is this, that they redound to thy pleasure, and for thee Triamore , sith now againe thou hast thy hearts content, remember the estate of thy old father as thou toldest mee, is compassed within the circle of yonder beseedged walles, still expecting the speedy help of his forward friends: but yet hath this nights worke so weakned hys foes, as that there is no doubt of further danger. By this with such like chat had they chased awaie the sable show of this silent night, and next the sunne gins with cheareful countenance to looke vpon the honorable actes of their thrise prayse worthy exployts, when by this time they were wandred farre from the place where they first gaue the onset to atchiue this honour: where Chinon calling to him his two countrymen, giues this carefull charge, You two quoth he whose honors accents is euerie where blazed for your valours, shal hencefoorth leaue these wandring wayes, and returne with me into our Countrie: where I will present to my longing Father this Pagan Prince, the first fruits of my Mayden manhood, dooing all my humble dutie to hys Honorable age: but first in safety let vs conueye these Fayre friends to their fathers Court, and set them there safe from further sorrow at home, that haue sustained the hard brunt of fell misfortune abroad, where may as many pleasures attend them there in peace, as honorable accidents happen to me in warres. Of Chinons returne into England, accompanied with Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram , with their most honorable entertainment there. After that hee had thus aduentured for the recouerie of beauteous Celestina from the handes of the Soldan, that had traiterously tane her away from Syr Triamore ,  & sent them home to her fathers Court to solemnize their marriage. Lancelot, Tristram , and himselfe, tooke the direct way that led them home into theyr own country, that there they might in quiet tell those thinges with pleasure amongst theyr friendes, which they had in trouble performed with labour amongst their foes: In which iournie no occasion of further let encountered them anie more, but as fareth with ordinary trauailers, they peaceablie passe ouer their iournie, till they came home into Cornewall to Earle Cadors Court, that was not a little glad to see the returne of his sonne, with good hap to answere the long expectation of hys faire hope, he entertaines them with such curtesie, as commonly passe betwixt lost friends, at theyr vnacquainted meetings. Chinon discoursing to hys old father the storie of their trauailes whose very wordes breedes new life in the dryed sinnowes of hys old limmes: as doeth the approaching sunne cherrish the decayed winter worne strength of the earths increase. Lancelot hee presents to hys loue the Trophies of his victorie, with many perswasions how for her loue hee had aduentured his life in winning those Princely Prizes, the chiefe wherof (whose worth exceeded all except herselfe) he had bounteously bestowed vppon sir Triamore, Tristram , he followes on his friends with the praises of them both: first how by their meanes the Lady was atchiued: then how by Chinons deuise she was secondly attained, with all the whole History of their former fortunes: where what ioy was generally receaued, as well of the King himselfe, and her, that whose life still lasts in the euerliuing acts of succeeding ages, famoused as much for the renowne of his round table, as Alcides for his twelue labors, Iason for hys iournie to Calcos , or the Greekes for theyr triumphes at Troy . Hee now in the winter of hys waning age, affecting to heare that now of others which before in his youth he had effected the like himselfe, welcomes home all these wearie wanderers, that had beene so long abroad, writing in the Registers of other realmes the courage of their own country: as also the poore inhabitants of this pappy Kingdome, that ioyed to see their neighboring lands dispoyled of such riche rewardes as was brought home by their countrymen. Thus when euery man had filled his eares with the report, Arthur willing also to further the courage of this young Caualeer, summons a solemne meeting of all the Nobles and Peeres of his country to his Court: where when at the time apointed all were gathered together, the King at a Royall banket, gins to declare the cause of this their calling together, that themselues should see how Princely he had, and would still pay the rewards of such deserts, as by the aduentures of their yong countryman Chinon had beene prosperously performed, and then with Epethites accents of honour, telling the victorious tale of his fight, as Aeneas the Tragicke storie of their flight he concludes hys speech with the performance of hys promise, which was the solemn orders he commonly vsed at the instalment of any of his Knights, and dubbing him, there withall appoints him his place at the Table: where a while he remained, as well to comfort the decaying date of his Fathers yeares: whome wrestling age had almost now layed along in hys graue, and as the Mariegold that neuer spreadeth her flowers but against the sunne: So he neuer opened his age dimmed eyes to beholde the chearefull countenance of any creature saue his Son Chinon , and like the melancholly Turtle when her mate is from her sight: So fares it with this aged Earle, that neuer sleepes but dreames of hys Sonne, neuer is well waking when he sees him not, & neuer contented with any sounds if he heare him not: as also the intire affection of hys King and Captaine Arthur of England, that inamored with his curtesie, was lost to leaue hys company, he was forced a while to refraine his affections, whose body thought it was walled in at home, yet was his minde wandring abroad: which the fates foreseeing (as do the careful Parents prouide for their forward children) seeke meanes for theyr furtherance in that quallitie whereto they are most inclined, loath that so many vertues should be cooped within the compasse of a sillie Iland, and not spread their braunches abroad to the wide world, carefully contriued a meanes to conuaye hym away. How Chinon was by the Fairies conuaied into Egipt . Thus hee spending the pride of his dayes at home in daliance, letting rust eate away his well tempered Armour, that warres before had scoured, lying one day vppon a pleasant ouerspread banke, vnder the couert of a nature framed Canopie, bound together with the bowes of sweet smelling roses: vpon whose pleasant spraies sate the seuerall sorts of musicke making birdes, that with theyr naturall notes, calles on inchaunting sleep to possesse the quiet organes of his body with all pleasing rest, in the midst of a sweet slumber, suddainely appeares to the view of his drowsie thoughts, two airie bodies such creatures as we call Fairies, whome some imimagine to be those spirites that fell downe vpon the earth, and since that time inhabit the seuerall corners thereof; sometimes deluding mens senses with the showes of that they are not: other, somtimes showing themselues in the semblances they commonly accustome to put on, dancing roundelayes ouer the plesaunt meades, searing the secrete corners of euerie shade: in which sort it should seeme they found thys Knight, to whom they gan shewe a rich embrodered armour, curiously carued and richly set with all manner of precious stones, and a faire sword with all the formall furniture thereunto belonging, faire passing that which before he had pulled out of the Rocke, and there withall ginnes feed his fancie, that they nourished his imagination in the perfectest ioye of all naturall delight, with the show of a faire Uirgin, whose rare countenaunce promised more than her outward colour of attire, for that meane were her weeds, such as commonly we read of the Arcadian Shepheardesses, whose perfectios haue put to silence so many pens in labouring to portrait their picture. But her selfe more than a mortall Maid, looked vppon with the impartial censure of a iudging eye, might draw into an endlesse Laborynth, the labouring thoughts of an indeuoring wit, striuing with it selfe to picture forth her worth. Where a while we must leaue him Endimion -like spending his time in this sweete speculation, and for a time talke of this rare sight here showed hym in his sleep. This Ladie, was daughter to an ancient Lord, named Bessarian cheif Counseller to Egbaton then King of Egypt , and was there earnestly beloued of a noble Man named Perosus who for that he saw by no way he could compasse his desire, neither by amorous demeanor of himselfe, instance of his frends, nor earnest soliciting deserts of his dumb intermissiue gifts could preuaile to drawe towarde him the dutye of her loue he determining by another drift ether to win her to himselfe, or to weare her out of conceit with all other, secretly this worke with an old Witch, whose name was Eutropa , who hyred by him, hammered about to work some meane how she might change the setled affections of her maidenlyke minde, somwhat to encline themselues to his intent: which when by no meanes she could bring about, she straight works a way to remoue her quite from all companie, to liue on the vnpeopled Plaines among brute beasts, and to that ende aiming her actions, by meanes of an ayrie Spirit attendant vppon her, suddenly conueyed her from the Courtly presence farre off to an vnfrequented Plaine, scituate by the Riuer Nylus , where shee perceiuing her selfe displaced, but seeing no reason of her remooue, straitwaies begins to consider with her selfe what luckles occasion might thus crosse her in her hopefull course, and when after long search in the selfe knowen records of her inward conscience, shee could finde no readie reason, how her offences should anie wayes haue procured so great a punishment, as this vnnaturall diuorse, not onely from the comfort of her kindred, but all other frends, hauing with all humble dutie alwaies honored her superiors,  & wyth carefull curtesie intreated her inferiors beeing euer held as the myrrour of good demeanor. And thus finding her selfe as cleare from those vengeaunce meriting sinnes that drawes downe the heauie wrath of all-iudging Gods so sharply with such seuere plagues to punish the offences of men, shedding manie showers of amber teares, whose power were able to haue drawne pittie from the steely hearts of hell- holden furies, sits her downe by the side of that siluer streame, that with his seauen heads, still sends fresh supplie to the all eating sea, and tuning her voice to the bubling musick of his gliding course, & to the flocking sortes of sundry fishes, that like the dancing Dolphins at the sweete sound of Arions Harpe gather themselues together. Ye free borne people from th'inthralling bands, That we poore soules perforce are subiect to: You glide with pleasure ore these golden sands, And feeles no hope of weale, nor hap of woe. Time, fortune, foes, nor any other power, Changes, casts downe, or turnes your sweet to sower: But we whome nature wrought vnto the best, Triumphant time still tosses vp and downe: And they whome former fortune whilome blest, Cruell misfortune with a suddaine frowne: Casts from a throane where sur'st we seeme to dwell, To worser woes than death, dispaire, or hell. Thus whilest with this song shee sought to please her sorrow sodainely this wicked woman, (by whose meanes shee was brought thether,) carried through the emptie aire in fierie flaming cars, such as was that secret searching Medea , amidst the sable shadow of the silent night, ouerroad so many tops of hilles to finde those hearbes, that in the age worne limmes of a bloodles man, cals backe fresh spring to keep againe his residence in that body: when presenting her selfe vnto her in the accustomed shape at other times shee vsually shewed, her selfe: begins at her first entrance to disclose vnto her the manner of translation from her father and friends vnto these peopleles plaines, confessing her selfe both to be Author and actor of this diuellish deuise: where quoth she for the coy countenances that so oft thou haste repayed to the pitty moouing perswations of him, that for thy loue well nie lost, weares out in woe, the dayes and watches with tirrible torments the night, that in euerie sentence he speakes, so oft cites thee by thy proper name, and himselfe with bare conceit that hee hath, thee whom by consent he rightly should haue had, pines awaie poore soule in the phisicke fits of a passionate louer In whose reuenge quoth shee I haue here seated thee by thy selfe, far from the resort of men, where desolation shall here teach thee to tell thy selfe that thou art now worse than wilde beasts, that before esteemest of thy selfe better than faire framed men: where quoth she, till thou canst call backe thy proude presuming thought, to pitty his case that for thee spends his life in such care, here shalt thou haue thy abode, and be as far from any consolation of others, as then art from comforting of him, and so sodainely leauing her againe to her selfe she departed. At which abrupt Oration, the maid seemed at the first dismayed: yet at length comfortes somewhat more her conceit, in that she knew the meanes of her remoue, and so at last after shee had long remained there in that people wanting world, to eschue the occasion of harme, and the effect of idlenes, shee be tooke herselfe to carefull keeping of some simple natured sheepe, whereof that place was stored, of whose wooll she now begins to spinne her selfe some homely atire, that was wont to be robed in the richest aray that nature and Acts could afford, and in the meane time, the weary wordes preuenting all occasions of further misfortune, that might els in the continuance of time haue crossed theyr intent, workes meanes to discredit her wofull Father: who now destitute of all his children, his daughter the hope of comfort to hys declining age, and hauing three godly sonnes, whome nature had euery way furnished with gifts fitting their degrees, whose names were Michander, Terpander , and Theonas : all these had hee employed in the quest of their sister, when as his foes taking the aduantage of their time, Perosus that was alse a Counceller, gins secretlie to informe the King of certaine treasons pretended to his life and land, by Bessarian father to thys new shepheardesse, of whome before wee tolde you: to the end that hauing vnfurnished him of the Kinges fauour, himselfe might the easlier effect what occasion soeuer should be offered, and the poore father left destitute of all meanes to further his sonnes affaires: which the king at the first was loth to beleeue, both for that he had had so long tryall of the faithfull seruice old Bessarian had alwaies performed, as also that hee supposed that such subtiltie could not harbour in a siluer coloured head:: for that quoth he Serpents alwaies lurke in young greene tufftes, & not in winter wythered grasse, age abolishes deceits, as it abandons vaine delights, & as the bodie waxes weake, by so much more doth the minde waxe strong, as being nowe freed from all the intising affections in hys age, whereunto the vaine pleasures of this wicked world did still intise him to in his youth: whereunto the other ready to replie with fresh inforsive argument, shewes straight to the King the intermissive letters that so long had passed too and fro, betwixt Bessarian and many of his Maiesties enemies, for the effecting of their treasons, to which he had so cunningly counterfeited the oldmans hand, as if himselfe had substancially set it downe, and the better to proue euery seuerall circumstance of this his surmised tale, hee presently produces two or three periured companions, who for that purpose hee had subborned: whose substantiall tale tooke such effect, and so farre incensed the King, that in all haste sending for the old guiltlesse soule who was so farre from pretending this ill, that notwithstanding all the crosse occasions that so vnluckely had hapned vnto him, he spends all his time intending still naught but hys Soueraignes good: where when hee came, the King breaking foorth into impatience, beginnes with traiterous names to vpbraid him, who God knowes was so farre from inuenting it, that he studied nothing more than the preuenting it: and then vnripping vnto him the forged treason, shewing him the counterfet letters signed by his own hand, the seuerall circumstances prooued by such sufficient witnesses, as there pretended themselues to be, impatient of excuse, and therefore vtterly denying to heare his further answere, still vrged by the enuious inuented perswasions of his subtill enemie, gins thus to bewray his hatred. Experience quoth he hath taught vs, and the dayly proofe of still present time offers occasions to our eies of new examples, how in brute beasts the countinace of long time groundes perfect loue, as the silly dogge that brought vp at hys Masters trencher, in his kinde remembers his curtesie, and whiles nature lends him libertie of life, indeuors himselfe still in all duty to requite it, and shall then man their reasonable ruler, be worse than these reasonles thinges, by him so ruled? herbs, trees, and other vegitable creatures increasing from the earth, to them that with care manure their roots & prune their braches render fruit for a reward, the beastes they in their sundrie kindes requites their owners cost: as one with his skinne, another with hys fleece; one with his huffe, and another with hys horne, one with hys labour, and another with hys loue; and shall not then he whome God hath made as Master of all these creatures exceede them in his reasonable raign, that subiect theselues reasonles to be ruled. Since first I came to sway the heauie Scepter of this great Kingdome, and tooke into my hands the tuition of so many people as inhabite these spacious plaines of wide west Egipt , haue nourished thee euen in my bosome: nearest haue I kept thee to my selfe, because I would draw thy affection from all other, & haste thou now with Esopes vngratefull snake, stinged him in the breast, that so carefully sought to preserue thee in his bosome. Can it be that vnder the reuerend show of such honourable age, should rest the vndeserued thoughtes of vnreuerent reuenging rage. Is there founde foule drosse in faire gold, bad showes on good substances, & can there be such hatred in sure hearts? I, I, I see the fayrest somer shine hath his sodaine shower the best blossome is oft times soonest blasted & the truest friend prooues oft the most trecherous foe: But as no man comends the sunnie morning, nor the showrie night, the frustrate hope of his fruite, for the bad blasted bud: so let euery man especially condemne the soules secret friende, when hee turnes to a sore serching foe: which simile I to thy selfe must now applie: that vnder the faire show of friendship, hast secretly gone about to ouerturne my estate, & bring this welgouerned common weale to a ruinous decayed wracke, which fault is so apparant, both by thine owne hand sufficiently set foorth, as also confirmed by the Testament of others: as that my pacience, scarce conteining it selfe within the bounds of euill behauiour, cannot abide to heare any excuse, and therefore will I against thee pronounce this heauie doome for thy ill deseruing deedes, the punishment of death were a pleasure to thee, so that so I should ease thee of a great deale of sorrow, if thou shouldest still continue in thy best state thou wert likely to sustaine, and therefore from hencefoorth like a cursed creature, shalt thou wander in the world and eate the bitter bread of banishment in a forraine soyle, that whilome liuedst so sweetly in thine owne naturall seat, and so for euer I banish thee from the compasse of this Kingdome, to burie thy siluer haires in sorrow, that haddest such hope to harbour them in their graue with ioy. At which wordes the olde man not able to speake for the abundance of teares that stopped vp the way of his wordes, was forced to leaue him without further replie and hopeles of any helpe, patiently to departe. By this time had the King (more to punish his supposed amis,) seazed vpon all his goods, to the ende he might leaue him no succour to saue himself abroad: which when he saw, sorrowfully sighing to himselfe, desperately departes away without any further following the King, for the repeale of this his punishment, and straight way betakes himselfe to hys trauaile: which when Perosus perceaued how they now had brought euery thing euen to the bent of their own bow, gins glorie to themselues in their likely prosperitie, purchased by the hard hap of an others aduersitie: but on a sodaine Europa , the Witch by whose counsell all this trecherie was contriued, looking further into the matter what was likelie to follow: by these meanes perceaued in the speculatiue glasse, how that the rightful reuenging gods had by many means determined her release: as first by Chinon , whom for that purpose they had brought out of England: then by her brethren, who had vndertaken to search all the world for their sister, and lastly by her father, whose giltles banishment could not long be concealed, & the beeing called home to hys former place, woulde seeke such meanes for her recouerie, as their power coulde hardly preuent, and therefore to escape these insuing illes he thus determined to deale. The maide who though she was from thence far remote, and in a place whether lay no ordenarie passage: yet foreseeing how at length that all would hit vpon that way incloses by her wicked workes this faire Damsell within the ruine of an olde Rocke hard by the riuer side, vpon whose bankes before shee made her abode: where accompanied with shadowes of naturall creatures, hauing faire womanly faces like her selfe, that seemed to outward sence of the far beholders, to make her merrie with melodious musicke, but to her selfe she found it far contrarie, proouing nothing els but a harsh discord of misliking sounds: which outward semblance was for this purpose by them prouided, that it might some what satisfie any idle beholder, to see that her prison was rather a pleasure, than anye such paine as should mooue the mindes of men to venture any thing for her release: where poore soule shee now coopt vp in a Cage that before tooke her pleasure vpon those spacious plaines, like to the beguiled bird that vnwares falling into the Fowlers gin, is nowe caged vp in a little compasse, that whilome was wont to play vpon the broad branches of euery springing Plant. How Bessarian her father was by the Witch turned into the likenes of a Beare, and how hee met with his sonnes in that shape. Thus hauing determined of her, they straight waies begin to striue with themselues how they might deuise some drift to remooue the feare that they had of her Fathers rising againe to his former state, which by the meanes of Eutropa the Witch they thus contriued. Shee calling to counsaile her attendant spirits: by whose meanes shee brought to passe all this matter, gins giue them seuerally in charge to vse their Artes in plaging of this poore man, which they should so surely effect, as no hope should be left of any more comfort to come vnto him: where beating together their hell bred braines, they thus concluded with theselues, that they woulde chaunge hym from the shape of a man, into the big body of an vgly. Beare, and so let him die a beast that was borne a man, and further yet, to aggreuate hys woes, which might notwithstanding this enuie haue an end, they intended in his disguise to hasten on hys death, least by some crossing occasions, as oftentimes are vsually seene vnexpectedly fall out for the release of Magicke bandes, which they thus determined when they had wrought their willes in his transformation, about his necke they hang a scroule, wherein were written two verses which were these. He whose good hap shall kill this beare, That man shall haue his hearts desire. Thinking by this meanes the better to drawe on euery mans might, to the effecting of their former plotted purpose, for that all men by a naturall instinct ar greedie to get any hope of pursuing their purposes, though oft times they doe it with the danger of theyr liues: where the oldman turned after this manner, wanders through the woods, clogged with the burden of selfe feeling sorrow, and in dispayre of reliefe, settles himselfe to that thraldome without hope of release. Many were the miseries in this shape hee sustained, as the many hungry dayes that in spite of himselfe he was forced to spend for that his stomacke was not vsed to feede vpon such filthie carion, as those beasts accustomably deuoure, the raw restlesse nights without couert hee must now continue, the want of his friends, and feare of hys foes, with a countlesse company of more griefes than the capacitie of man can conceaue was conteyned in him, being then as a beast, sauing that still he retayned the vse of his reasonable soule, which they by no meanes could make to miscarie. In the meane time the Witch now in the midst of her busines, seeing in her speculatiue Glasse (wherein she vsually saw what accident soeuer was likely to happen) the approach of her Brethren, who (by tracing vp and downe in the World) were some of them come neere (at vnwares) to the place where she was; poasted her selfe with all speed, the better to prosper her purpose, and with violence inforces a spirit (one of her owne Attendants) to vse the organes of her bodie, to an ende which her selfe had deuised: that was, to send sundrie wayes her Brethren, who were like seuerally to come thether where now their Sister did soiourne. And by that time this Hag had brought this purpose to passe, Michander her eldest Brother (that now almost wearied with walking vp and downe among the high desolate Hills) had framed his iourney towards that Riuer, the which with his swelling waters moystens once euerie yere those pleasant Egyptian Plaines, to refresh his tyred limmes in the coole streames of that pleasant Current, bathing his sweet bodie in those refreshing Springs, suddenly in the midst of a clouen Rocke he espies sitting a companie of faire Creatures, whereof one (exceeding all lyke the Huntresse amidst the naked troupes of her attendant Nimphs) hee quickly startes vp and hies to the place where he supposed they should bee: to which as hee came neerer, hee might perceaue the middlemost Ladie that so farre exceeded the rest, to be Cassiopea his Sister, for whom he had made such search: when in an extasie of ioye, standing still as not able at the first to vtter the sudden mirth of his minde, the enuious Stone closes his sides and shuts them al from his sight. At which sudden accident, his senses as farre cast downe as before they mounted themselues with the hope of recouering his Sister, gins with himself deuise what this matter might meane, till from the Rocke hee heard one pitifully call him by hys owne name; which at length he perceiued to be the voice of his Sister whom before he had seene: and answering againe to her sudden call, ginnes demaund by what meanes he might come vnto her? To whom straight she answeres, that there was no passage to that place: for that by the wicked worke of an enuious Inchantresse, she was ther so surely inclosed, as neither force of man, edge of weapon, violence of fire, nor any other earthly meanes whatsoeuer the World could affoord was able to auaile, except himselfe would aduenture one thing for her deliuerance. And then shee coniures him by the dutie he ought to his Father, the loue to her his Sister, and the care of preseruing their Kindred, that he should vndertake this Aduenture: which he with more earnest desire offers to doo, than she could with her former reasons perswade hym too, desiring her to tell him his taske, that he might slip no time, but in al hast hye him to the performance of this thing, which was like so highly to pleasure the both, her with comfort, and him with content. To whom she thus begins to vnfold her intent. Under (quoth she) that toplesse Hill which we call by the name of Taurus , that with his length gyrdells in the wyde Continent of flowring Asia , vnder the roote of an euerlasting Lilly, stands there a Uiall full of Uirgins teares, that encoutred with the like crosse as I am now (poore Soule) in, and before her release dyed there for sorrow: to whose eternall memorie, against the infectiue rage of this ouer ruling power, the Fates haue there reserued that powerfull Potion, whose Uertue is to breake the strongest inchaunted Bands; and so Shee that by them was thus bound while shee liued, haue the Gods ordained as an Instrument to vnbinde them now she is dead. But the still working wits of these wicked wretches, hatching nothing but harme, intending nothing but what is ill, and perfourming nothing but that which tends to our plague, haue to preuent that which is thus prouided, strongly garded the ground where thys Uyall standeth, with the power of a sight killing Serpent, such as we call a Cockatrice, against whom no power is able to preuaile. At which words, Terpander breaking her from hir furder discourse, ginnes to perswade his sister a little with patience, and ere long hee doubted not by hys meanes to work her libertie. And thus like the greedie Grey-hound that suddenly sets out to follow the swift footed Hare, flies he to attaine his purpose, beleeuing as his sorrowfull Sister did, that there had been that vertue in the water, but it was onely the deceipt of her deadly Enemie, that determined to make away all her Bretheren whose indeuours were else likely to worke her release: and therefore (as before wee said) inforced her tung to tattle that which her minde did not meane, whereby shee might bee theyr deaths in seeking to doo her good. Not long after Tepander had thus betaken himselfe to his iournie, with hope that her release from that place shoulde repay the desertes of his paines, comes to her the second brother, whose name was Micander , and hee as the first ioyfull to see the ende of hys iournie, which was the sight of hys sister, begins after the manner of newe met friendes to resalute her, and as he offered to haue kissed her hand for ioy of his good happe sodainely the Rocke shutting her from him, deuorces a sunder both their desires to resalute whose proffered kindnesse, she speaking from her prison, telles him with teares the manner of her inclosure, intreating him by all the true loue that nature workes in the mindes of men, that he would vndertake some meanes for her freedome; which he readier to offer than shee willing to inioyne, calls to hys solemne vow all the Gods of Heauen and Guiders of Earth, that were it a greater toyle than to number the sands of the Shore, the droppes in the Sea, or the starres in the Skie, more heauie than the burden of Atlas , more toylsome than the Labours of Hercules , or more tedious than the Laborynth of Theseus , hee would with ease vndergoe it, with courage performe it, and with pleasure proceed in it: and therefore hastened her forward (poore Soule) to pronounce hys harme. She gins tell him, that in the Deserts of Arabia rests Orions Harpe, brought thether by the meanes of an Inchauuntresse, to release from the thraldome of such subiection as now I am in, a valorous Knight, whom another Magitian had there imprisoned: and fayling by some crosse occasion to perfourme the purpose whereunto it was brought, there still remaines; but kept by a man eating Canniball , hauing neither the forme of a man, nor the fashion of a beast, but compound of them both. Him (quoth shee) if thou canst ouercome, and bring backe that well tuned Instrument, at whose stroakes the dauncing Dolphin delighted, beares on his backe wofull Orion from the furie of the fierce swelling seas, when by the Pirates he was cast among the waues. The sound whereof wilbe sufficient to vndoo the doores of this diuelish deuice: for which deed thou shalt bee blessed, and I borrowed from this punishing prison. Which said, the forward yong Man, loath to loose time by standing on reply, gets speedily from the place and hies him to his labour. After whose departure, by chance (as did both the first) comes Theonas the yongest and last of these brethren, who at a sudden seeing his Sister there inclosed in the Rocke, gins as did the other, to resalute her with such louing looks as accustomable passe betwixt longing frends at their first meeting; wher after manie words on both sides, Theonas wondring why she should sit so still in her seate, and not offer the like curtesie he intended to her, gins to draw neerer the place where she was, when on a sudden, the Rock (closing together) denies his neerer approach: at which, shee sorry within and he as sad without, gins both of them distil as manie amber teares from their christal eies, as might haue dissolued againe the craggie cliffes of those pittiles Rockes. At length shee (as afore to the other two) gins tell him the manner of her life, and intreates his aid for her release, telling him of a perilous Iland that was somteime kept by a skilfull woman named the wise Erganea , where on an Altar in a Temple (there built vnto her name) lies a golden Booke, in which (quoth she) is contained all the Enchauntments that Arte can affoord, and their seuerall releases again, kept by two Harpies (such were those monstrous birds with whom Alcides fought, and for his conflict with them was so great, it was accounted as one of the xij. Labours hee atchieued): thence if thou canst but fetch it away, it wil be the only meane to worke my release, and end thy long desires and tedious labour. Wheretoo the yong man attentiuely harkening, as one that longed to eternise his name to succeeding posterities, for the perfourmance of some such famous Worke, makes small delay to prosecute this busines, with comfortable promises of fairer dayes, cheering and comforting her minde, leaues her to the mercy of her Foe, till his happie returne make her more fortunate. These seuerall Aduentures by her imposed on her Bretheren, had this Witch before prouided, only for a meane to destroy all them that should in this labour indeuour themselues, and perforce made her tongue the vnwilling Instrument to incite them to this ill: who otherwise intended their indeuours onely for her good. How Chinon came to the Rocke where the Ladie was inchaunted, and what happened thereof. In this time the Fayries (by whose meanes Chinon was conueighed out of England ) had brought hym to the place, where in the Uision whilest he lay asleep vnder the Arbour in England , they shewed him the faire Shepheardesse, and had taken their leaue, telling him, how (by his meanes) that Ladie (now in Captiuitie) was to bee released: but how manie dangers hee must first passe through, left him thereto folow his farder fortune, with great promises that after labour he should finde rest, after stormes calmes, and after frowning aduersitie smyling prosperitie: and so on a sudden vanished away. When he (seeking vp and downe for her, whome by no meanes he could find) wondring how so rare beutie could be bred in such a homely soyle, whereas the Earth was vnfruitfull for want of tillage, the Trees vnorderly bearing frute for lacke of pruning, and the seuerall Beasts disagreeing in their owne kindes for want of ordering: plainly the true definition of solitarie desolation, that oft abounding in all things, is cause of decay to euerie thing. At last as hee wandered along the Riuer, he heard excellent musique, and a more excellent voyce tune forth this Ditie. How sweete a thing is this Content To which poore countrie Swaines are born These falls of Fortune they preuent, And other hard mishaps doo scorne. Oh how thrice blessed had I beene, If (but obscurde in countrie weedes) Those mightie men I nere had seene, Whose loathed loue my sorrow breedes? But such is the vnconstant state Of this still-changing Worlds delight, Making the meane a Princes mate, Crossing high hopes with low despight. Which makes my Soule (in sad despaire) Die here ten thousand times a day, Woond vp within a world of care, Whence nought can it release away. When hee following the sound of the voyce, at length found her where she was sitting in the hollow side of a Rocke, hemmed round about with a show of such creatures as her selfe, to whom Chinon ginnes thus to bewray himselfe. Ah thou more than thy selfe, in that thou retainest too heauenly a forme for anie earthly frame. How impartiall are the Fates that turnes the neuer standing Wheele of Fortune, to grace with so continuall a Sunne this Soyle, and lowre with obscure showres on other places. Goddesse of these Plaines that giuest more grace to these fields, than did the Goddesses to the place where they pleaded for the golden Prize. Hadst thou liued in those dayes when young Apollo loued, then hadst thou been the Paramour of Learnings Prince, and guided his will that now gouernes the World. For thy sake am I transported from the furthest place of the wide western World, into these cynged Plaines of euer ouer dried Egypt . For thee will I follow the aduentures of Armes, so that when for thy sake I haue sought the World, and with my sword engraued (in neuer changing characters) thy God like name in the farthest corners of all breeding Earth, where no consuming fire, cutting sword, nor eating eternitie shall euer weare awaye thy memorie: so that for my labour thou wilt reward me with thy loue. When with exceeding passion he had deliuered these speeches, with more than common admiration he paused, like one that were suddenly amazed wyth the showe of some vnacquainted sight, stood a long while as in a traunce: when as the wylie Witch perceiuing this new come Companion likely to marre what shee and false Perosus (by their practises) had been so long a making, beginnes to take once more the charge of her tongue, and thus boldly begins to tie him to his taske. Faire Knight quoth shee, whose willing minde to doo me seruice, wins more reward than I am able any wise to bestow: If I were what now I am not, then would I doe what now I doe not, with fauour requite thy forward fortunes: but thus it is, and then she begins in a long Historie to relate her frowning fortunes. First drawne from the Court, then perforced long time by her selfe to dwell solitarily vpon that vnpeopled soyle, and lastly when shee began to comfort her selfe with that country content: then solitarily to shut her vp in that place, where was no passage for any people to come to her, and she depriued of all power to come out to them, & then telling how there rested no hope of redresse, if that for her sake some mighty man would not vndertake a trebble taske, worse than tormented Sisiphus hys toyle. Which words wrought such a desire in the minde of this forward Knight, as vowing to performe more mightie deedes than those deedes of the olde Giantes that heaping hill vpon hil assayd the height of heauen, he instantly begins to intreat that in this her charge, she would admit of him as her Champion. At which wordes the Hag that all this while had hid her substance in an inuisible shade, gins vrge her to impose vpon him all those plagues she had appointed the other three, and when hyr perswasiue Oration was scarce done, hys eager minde that alreadie was working for so faire a rewarde, like the towring hawke, that swiftly takes the aduantage of the fearefull foule fares hee, that proud to himselfe so faire a Saint should so soone accept of his seruice, and imploy him in so serious a peece of seruice as was the remedy of her release, flies with al speed to effect hys purpose, and shee poore soule hoping well that one of her workmen would at last returne againe with the reward of their worke, with comfort contents her selfe to abide the end: where wee must a while leaue her very melancholily meditating with her selfe, howe shee might best spende her time in that wicked Prison, thinking euery houre to bee a whole yeare, and euery yeare a thousand, till shee had heard againe some newes of her searching seruants, that had spred them selues all abroad in the wide world to seeke her some meanes for to mittigate her miserie, and restore her to her former freedome againe, and nowe a while follow our seuerall Aduenturers for her aide, that by this time had trauailed far from the place where they first tooke in hand this iournie. How these brethren came to the seuerall places appointed by the sister, and of their aduenture there. through the spacious plains of Asia , hopelesse to finde: for that beeing long since, hee came to the side of the mountaine, where hee was promised to finde this viall of teares, and had almost sought euerie seuerall corner of the same, and yet could finde no likelyhood of any such matter: Notwithstanding loath to leaue vnsought any place, where shewed any appearance of such a matter. At last he saw a farre off the rising as it were of an Alablaster Rocke that halfe ouershadowed a hole, artificially cut into the side of the hill: whether hying him apace to see what thereby might be meant, came at last to the place, and there at the first seeing nothing that might any waies auaile him, was about to depart againe, till hearing somewhat hasting it self foorth of the hole, he stood stil to see what it might bee, at last appeares vnto him the forepart as it were of an ouergrowne Cocke, but farre greater than any of that kinde, that with his fierie eyes poysons euery obiect he sees, against whose force Terpander had prouidently prouided a bright Armour of steele, which couered euery seuerall part of him, on whome when he looked, the reflexe of hys sight, sending back againe the dart of poyson to himselfe, that hee threw out at another, powerfully poysoned himselfe, the hinder part of this beast was framed after the manner of a Cocodriles tayle, such as are commonly resident about the bankes of Nilus in Egipt, that with the force thereof had beene able to haue brused the best prooued Armour: with which when by the retorquation of hys ouer sight, he had lost the vse of his eyes hee lustily laid about, till such time as the vpper part of hys bodie forceably swelling with the inwarde working poyson, made him so vnwildie that now vnable to weald his body any more, was forced to fall downe, and with the power of the poyson shortly after died: which when Terpander perceaued that his foe was so soone foiled, taking it to be the place of which his sister had foretold, by reason that in her discourse, she discribed vnto him such a like keeper of that precious water, as was this same, that there kild with his owne weapon, lay dead before him, gins diligently to search vp and downe for the thing it selfe, which at last on the other side of the rocke he perceaued: where vnder a faire Lillies roote stoode the treasure for which he had spent so much paines: which when he saw, hartely thanking those helping heaues, that had so mightely, not only preserued him from the force of hys foe, but also helped him to the inheritance of that hee so much desired, goes boldly forward to the place, where hee saw this Lillie spring,  & taking away the viall which he poore soule tooke to be no other than the teares of a virgin, that by such kind of meanes as his sister had discribed vnto him was placed there, and about to returne with ioyfull newes of his sisters deliuerance, hee had not gone farre from the place where first hee found it, ere the Uiall beginning to warme with the heat of his hand, sodainely by vertue of the venomous water therein inclosed, infused such a contagious heate into euery seuerall vaine and sinnow of his body, as that wherewith the poysoned shirt was that inraged madding Hercules : So this poore man, that for his good meaning, was thus recompensed with ill measure inraged with the extreame paine of his inuenomed limmes, gins fall into a frantike humor, leauing the way should lead him backe againe to hys Sister, and furiously without regard of himselfe, gins reuenge hys iniurie vpon sensles and brutish beastes, that had now lost all the power of a man. This was the end the sorceres had intended shuld betide to him, that in hope to fetch his sisters blis shuld there finde his owne bane, and by some meanes or other kill himselfe, or els vnable so with reason to rule himselfe, should fall into the daunger of some wilde beast, who without pittying his case, might cast hym away where we must leaue him in his lunacie, and come to the second brother, who by this time was attained to the appointed place, scituate in the bosome of the Arabian deserts: where vpon a Cypresse branch he might a far off discerne the golden instrument, on whose trembling stringes the beauteous beames of the sunne delights to dally: There vnderneath this dismall shade, for that now the sunne at the Zenith of this Sphere, dartes downe his perpendicular beames with such force vpon the face of the earth, as makes euery creature seeke to shelter himselfe in the coole shades: for which cause this monster was then crept vnder the Cipresse shadowes, and ouercommed with the heate of the aire was then falne a sleepe: to whome when Micander came neere, diligently vewing each seuerall part of his deformed body, for that the Instrument hung high vpon the tree, and without styrring this stubborne beast could no waies be come by prepares himselfe after the best manner hee could to Combat with this Curre, and when he had buckled on his Armour, made readie his weapon and was now encouraged to encounter with hys enemie, gins with some such noyse as then hee made to rouse hym from hys rest. When as the Canniball like the throted Dogge whome Theseus awaked in the Gates of hell, sends out such a hideous crie, as affrighted the neighboring Birdes and Beastes that inhabite that part of the world with his terrible sounde, and shaking of himselfe, gins shew in hys vpper parts the perfect forme of a Dogge with long eares, which long dangling eares that exceeded the substance of the greatest spanniels, hung well nie downe to his middle. From the middle downeward he had the shape of a man, big boned as are these wilde people that liuing lawlesse in such vnruled places, feeding themselues after their fashion vpon the fat of the earth, out growes the common sort of well guided people, and taking vp from the earth a great Iron club, such as was in his iudgement too big to be swayed by a ma, without any warning gins fall to his weapon: where betwixt them two was begun a dangerous fight, & long time continued with vncertaine hope of succes, till Micander nimbly eschueing the weight of his weapons fall, gins get within his reach, & so carues his skinne and bones with his well tempered sword: which for that purpose he had only prouided, that in short time hee made him with the great issue of blood that fell from hys wounds so weake, as he was not able any more to beare the waight of his blowes, but was forced to fall vnder his foe: which when Micander perceaued, he straight waies dismembers him of all his limmes and leaues nothing behinde for his helpe, but the naked bulke of his body, and then reaching downe from the tree that fatall instrument, (which the Witch to another end than hee aimed at had prepared,) gins turne back his course, and with that Consort, hie him home to comfort his sister. As thus hee was trauailing to his long wished for place of ariuall sodainely hee determined with him selfe to trie what was the harmonie of that famous instrument, that with his sound coulde call the censelesse trees from their rootes, remooue the craggie Rockes from their Cliffes, mittigate the reuenging wrath of brutish deuouring beasts, compose concord betwixt the Lambe and the Lyon, the Hound and the Hare, the Fawcon and the sillie foule: whose strings he had no sooner touched, but determining with himselfe to sing some delightsome Ditty to the sweete tenth of these siluer sounding stringes, for ioy hee had compassed his desire. The powers of his tongue denying any more to execute their office, hee was sodainely stroken dumbe, which was the plague this witch had pretended should light on him, by the Magicke made sound of this Instrument, which was nothing els but an illusion as were all the rest, to draw these brethren into danger, where we wil leaue him making what shift his dumb demeanes affordes him to trauell homeward, and come now at last to the third brother. Theonas that by the fauorable hope of winde and weather was nowe ariued vppon the perillous Iland: where comming into the Temple of Erganea the wise Inchauntresse, that was richly adorned with all peculiar thinges therevnto belonging. At the vpper end thereof vppon an Altar of cleare Christal that was couered with a curious cloth of gold, ouer whome was hung the perfect picture of an ancient woman, which woman was the forenamed Erganea , there twixt two golden Candlestickes that were filled with two continuall burning Tapers censing the Temple with sweet sauours, lyes a golden book which was kept by two harpies, monsterous byrdes, halfe Women, and halfe Serpents, that with their winges so beats the young aduenturer, as hee was scarce able to abide theyr force. But as hee that looking still vpon the goles is better incouraged to goe forward, hee that sees the harbour, takes greater paines to get home, hee that is neare an end of his labour, thinkes all the paines but little hee hath to spend: So fares it with Theonas , that looking vpon the end whereto hee had endeuored himselfe, thinkes the paines but a pleasure hee indured, & in short time so behaued himselfe, as that he had ouerthrowne one of hys enemies, and then like the Hart, that by casting his horne, renues his strength, the Eagle by loosing his bill strengthens his flight so he at the sight of hyr fall, begins to fight a fresh, and in short time had the like succes of the one as before he had found in the other: so that nowe there was no partition betwixt him and his pray, but that he might take away the booke, to which when hee came, opening it that hee might bee an eye witnes what was there included, in steed of those powerfull spels that there he shuld haue read, from out the closure thereof came such a dustie fogge, as filling his eies with a blacke myst like vnto pitchie smoake he was suddenly stroken blind, and there left to grope his way back, that came thether with the perfect vse of his eyes. This Booke (as were both the rest) was nothing els but a deceipt of the Inchaunteresse, to drawe thether one of those Brethren; where (in stead of releeuing their Sister) they might inthrall themselues. Thus poore Theonas (euen in the prime of his Spring) hauing lost the vse of this light, which is the especiall comfort of mans life wanders vp and down like old forsaken Oedipus in his exilde life: where we must a while leaue him in this pitteous case with hys Bretheren. How Chinon met with these Bretheren seuerally one after another, and what became thereof. By this time was Chinon come to the place where we first left Thersander mad after hee had taken vp the Uiell of Water: who seeing him fare so with himselfe, rending vp trees by the rootes, tearing vp mightie stones from theyr places where they stood, and tumbling them downe from the tops of high hills, into the bottomes of deepe vallyes, who (notwithstanding his misfortune) kept still the Uiall about him vntouched: to whom Chinon came wondering to see what man should walke that waye, begins to question with him about the manner of his comming thether? To whom the mad man far vnlike himselfe, (for that before he was courteous, but now contrarie to his kinde hee had changed his countenance to hair-braind crueltie) and in stead of courteous behauiour, answeres him in rayling opprobrious tearmes, and at the length begins with force to assaile him as an enemie; which Chinon perceiuing, closing with the mad man as hee came to incounter with him forceablie casts him downe,  & taking from him the Uiall of water, which all this while hee had kept closely in his handes, beginnes to looke what it should be the poore soule had in such request, when suddenly by the like mischance that the other was changed, himselfe was with Lunacie presently possessed: and raging like Aiax after his foyle for Vlysses hys armour, or mightie Alcides when on the Mountaine Octa he built the Altare whereon himselfe was sacrificed, tearing his clothes from his backe, the hayres from his head, and launcing with deepe wounds the limmes of his bodie; releases Tirpander from the plague wherwith he was possessed, and brings it vppon himselfe. Which the other perceiuing how hee was deliuered from that daunger, pittied the wofull estate of this worthie Man, but helpe him hee could not, for that such was his inuincible strength, now by the force of his furie much more augmented, which force neither man nor beast, stocke nor stone, nor any other creature whatsoeuer was able to stand in hys hand; so that in short time, what with his vnorderly tracing through vnfrequented passages to finde fuell for his fire, and his swift paces that stil ouer-went the other wearie wearie man, who had tyred himself before in his furie, Chinon was quite gone out of his sight, whom wee must now leaue after the recouerye of his wits, trauelling home againe into hys owne Countrey, to seeke out some other meanes for the release of his Sister, and followe Chinon , who raging and rauing like an angrie Lion at last ouer-takes Micander , who (poore man) as quiet for the sorrow he had lost the vse of his tongue, as the other vnruly in his rage, seeing him a farre off, staid still to expect the euent of his sudden approach; when the madde man comming to him gins with vnseemly behauior to abuse the other poore distressed Soule, and wyth force pulling from him the Instrument which he was loth to loose, though by it he had incurred such a displesure: yet at last Chinon (farre stronger than the other) perforce pulls it away, and assaying with his fingers to strike the strings, was at the first sound thereof stroken dumbe, whereof as soone as Chinon was possessed, Micander was straight waye released. Which infirmitie when Chinon perceaued in himselfe, redoubling the rigour of his handes for the vse hee had lost of his tongue, gins furiously to fall vpon Michander and beate him, for being the Authour of his ill: which the other perceiuing, farre vnable to sustaine the strength of his stroake makes meanes to escape his hands, which by his swift flight hee soone attayned. So in short time ridding of himselfe enough from the feare of this foe, hee for his owne safetie, takes home the neerest waye hee could finde into hys owne Countrey. In the meane time Chynon wandring wyldly thus about the World all carelesse where hee went, because how soeuer hee turned, euerie where lay his way, at last comes downe vnto the Sea side, where by chaunce he findes a Boate readie furnished with all prouision necessarie for the Sea; who (after the manner of such madde men) leaping there intoo, (though ignorant what to do or careles whither to go, more than to satisfie his mad humor) launched from shore, and making shift to set vp his saile, was quickly conueyed farre from the sight of anie Land into the midst of the merciles seas, sayling too and fro manie dayes not fearing to be drownd, because he perceiued nothing: nor expecting anie place whether to goe, for that he scarce knew, where he was either at sea or on shore. But at the last (flying with his Barke before the Winde) he was suddenly driuen on shore vpon an Iland, where (leaping a land) he betooke himselfe to trauaile vp into the countrie, to see what people it did affoord: where he had not long trauelled, but a farre off vpon the side of a Hil he espied one sadly sitting by himselfe, towards whom he made what hast he possibly could. This was the yongest Brother of those three, that before we told ye of was stroken blind by looking into the inchanted Booke; to whom when he came, suddenly snatching the Booke out his hande, (after hys fond furious fashion) opens the claspes to see what was therein contained, when suddenly issued out such another fogge, as that wherewith Theonas was striken blinde, and in like manner bedazels his eyes: when presently Theonas was againe restored vnto his sight, and wondring to see there so goodly a man possessed with so manie plagues at once, ginnes then with himselfe consider how it should come to passe? who for that himselfe was vnacquainted with what had happened to his other Bretheren, could gesse at none but that which lately he was punished wythall himselfe: one, for that the reasonlesse Man (for all these troubles wherewith hee was tormented) could not (by his meanes) be brought within the compasse of quiet behauiour, thought it best to prouide some meanes for his owne escape, and leaue hym there to the mercie of GOD, that would not be ruled by the meanes of a man; so he betooke himselfe to his Iourney, where wee must also leaue him (ridde by thys meanes of a mischiefe) retourning to seeke hys Bretheren, and take some other order for their inchanted Sister. The Inchauntresse now (that all this while sawe the issue of this matter) greeuing that her cunning should be so crossed, and yet ioying that all these punishments were light vppon his head, whom she before feared more than all the rest: set all her wits aworke, to deuise a meanes how shee might (now hauing him at such a vantage) make him sure for euer escaping out of her hands againe foreseeing, that by his meanes all this scattered Kindred were likely to be restored againe to their former estate. And therefore (by her power) incloses him within the clift of a Rocke, against which she rouled vp a mightie stone, such as the force of manie ordinarie men was not able to remooue: and so least by any meanes he might be recouered out of this inchaunted Castle, shee places as Porter before the doore thereof a mightie Gyant, twice as great and grim as the ordinarie kynde of such ouer-growen Creatures vse to bee. Where, when hee was inclosed (supposing him now safe enough from anie resort that should bring him releefe) she was content all his plagues should cease, and hee (the more to aggreuate his griefe) be restored againe to his wits; which was effected as speedily as determined. No sooner was he closely shut vp into that vncomfortable Cabin, but all his Instruments (by whose meanes he came by those crosses) as his Water, his Harpe, and his Booke vanished away, and he himselfe restored (as I before said) againe to the same estate of sense as he was before, his libertie onely excepted: where we must now awhile leaue him in his melancholy Cell, and retourne againe into England . to see the sorrow of olde Cador Duke of Cornwall , for the sudden departure (without taking leaue) of Chinon his Sonne. How Arthur of England sent three of his Knights to search for Chinon , & how they found him. Inchauntresse effecting, stil spent his yeares in sorrow for the sudden losse of his Sonne, and at last (wearied with too much grief) he intended to make some friendly meanes to the King, for to haue his royall fauour and helpe for his recouerie. Therefore on this determining, he repaired one day to the Court, and there finding the King and all his Knights, as carefull for his crosse misfortune as himselfe, gins in very humble manner (yet with honourable regard) thus to intreate his Maiestie. Most royall Souereigne (for whom from my first able yeares my seruice hath been imployed) vouchsafe me in my decayed yeares this Kingly comfort: Send foorth (I beseech you) some of his worthie fellow Knights to seeke Chinon my Sonne; who albeit he hath yet deserued little either of your Grace or of them, yet his forward endeuour hath alway showne he would much more ere this haue merited, had not enuious fortune crost him in this sort. To whom the King and all his Nobles present did most willingly condiscend. Then calling together al the Knightly companie of his Round Table, declared to them Duke Cadors request, and his owne readinesse to haue it vndertaken: who all were not onely to goe in Quest of Chinon , but each man manifested his more than common earnestnes, by taking offence if anie one were named beside himselfe. To ende this controuersie, the King thus prouided, that euerie man should drawe his Lot, and on whom soeuer it fell, that Knight should foorthwith chuse hym two Fellowes from the rest of the Companie, and so they three shuld take vpon them this desired trauaile. The Lots accordingly were made and euerie one of the Knights drew, and the Lot fell vpon Sir Calor , who was Sonne vnto Sir Lancelot du Lake and the beauteous Celestina Daughter to the King of France , whose Parents Chinon before valiantly reserued, being betraid and taken in the hands of the trecherous Souldan. But before their departure, it was thought conuenient (for the better furtherance of their Iourney) to take some counsell of Merlin , who then liued accounted as a Prophet in England , and by his skill could tell of secrete things forepast, and hidden mysteries to come. Merlin beeing sent for by the Kings commandement, came to the Court, and shewes them in a speculatiue Glasse the manner of his departure out of England , the manie troubles hee had endured in hys Iourney, and now at last opens at large the whole manner of that great miserie whereuntoo he is now brought by the meanes of that subtill Inchauntresse: telling them further, that except they made verie exceeding great speed for to procure his release, hee was likely to dye there for want of releefe, being there detained from all necessaries fit to sustaine a man; or at least hauing of those necessaries a verie short pittance allowed him. Merlin hastening them forward on their iourney, promised al the cunning he could affoord for their speedie conueyance, which he effectually perfourmed, so that in short time they were arriued in this perillous Iland: where after long search for the place wherein Merlin did promise they should finde their friend, at last they might espie this monstrous man, iaylour to that vnfortunate Knight, stretching himselfe at the mouth of the Caue wherein Chinon was kept. To him they made all possible speede, and first of all Syr Calor addressing himselfe to fight, gins before hee offered violence with curteous greetings to salute hym gently, demaunding what he was that liued so desolately in that vnfrequented Iland? To whom the detested and currish Carle made this vnmannerly aunswere. I am quoth hee as thou seest, one within whose clawes thou and the rest of thy sawcie companions haue compassed your selues: if therefore you will submit your selues to my mercy, then will I thus dispose of you heere within a hollow Caue hewne out of this craggie Rock, wherein lyes inclosed a knight such a one as you are, who for the like offence that you now haue offered, is condemned to the eternall slauerie of perpetuall imprisonment, within shall you spend your hatefull liues, and when for hunger you are welnie starued, fall freshly then to eate one anothers flesh, but if you stubbornely stand out against mee, thus will I dispoyle you in renting your cursed limmes peece meale a sunder, or els fastning you seuerall to the big bulks of some of these trees: where when the imperiall punishment of hastning hunger shall seaze vpon your selues, you shall there be inforced to eate your owne flesh, that might here haue fed vpon another, to whome Syr Calor thus answered. Foule vglie fiend, wee come not to kneele to thee, but to force thy subiection to vs and for the release of a Christian Knight that thou keepest Captiue within thy power. At which wordes the Giant seeing them addresse themselues to fight, presently he stirs himselfe, and taking an Iron mace, (which to that ende the Witch had prouided) lets driue at Sir Calor with all the might he could, from which he nimbly leaping away eschued the force of the fall, whe as the other knights comming into rescue sir Calor , before the Giant could againe get vp his weapon from the grounde, they had so mangled hys limmes, as he was now far vnable to fight, but falling prostrate downe before them, humblie intreats for his life: which they were willing to graunt, as not seeking the losse of him, but the life of their friend, to whome the Giant gins relate all the manner of the imprisonment of Chinon , and at the last opens the doore of the Caue, and calles him out to his friends, who resaluting one another with such friendly greetings as are vsuall at such aduenturos accidents, take their iournie from thence vp into the Countrie, and for that the Giant had tolde them in hys former discouse of the manner of Chinons imprisonment, how that Perosus for whose loue all this had come about, had in Egipt taken Armes against the King, for that his treason beeing discouered, he intended to recal old Bessarian from his banishment, and that his power so daylie increased, as that it was now far greater than the Kings, they intended to shape their iournie thetherwards and help the king in his warres against this traiterous rebbell: where wee must let them goe forward a while in their iourny, and returne againe to our three aduenturers for their sisters libertie. How Bessarians sonnes met with their Father in the shape of a Beare. After that these three yong men were againe restored to their former estate, Terpander the first of them trauailing homewards to seeke againe his sister, meetes by the way his transformed Father, who not a little glad to see his sonne, though the other taking him for no lesse than he seemed, made some hast to fly from him, till looking backe and perceauing the scroule about his necke for the regaining of his harts desire, strikes his poore father with such a blow, as breaking his sword vpon the scalpe of his head, he was forced to flie for want of weapons, fearing least the Beare should haue fallen freshly vppon him, beeing tyred when as God knowes the sillie man astonished with the stroke, was rather afraid of an vnnaturall deaths wound by his sonne, then willing to prosecute any reuenge for the same. Not long after Terpander had thus hurt his Father, comes that way the second brother, who in like case meeting with the Beare and hoping by his death to obtaine his desire, gins with a Borespeare hee had in his hand eagerly to assayle him, in so much that in short time hee had grieuously wounded hym, but the head of his weapon by chance breaking off, hee was forced to flie as did his brother: to be short the Witch that intended by the meanes of some of these sonnes, to make away their father. After that the first two had fayled, brought thether the third, who eager to accomplish his desire, promised by the scroule that hung about hys fathers necke, begins a fresh fight,  & so wounded his sillie sire, as that for want of blood which hys weapon had lauishly lanched out, hee was forced to fall downe, whome Theonas supposing to be dead, left there to follow his desire. In the meane time whilest these thinges were thus in dooing had there beene sought a great battaile in Egipt, betwixt Egbaton their king, and Perosus the traitour, of whome before we told you: where by the meanes of the Englishmen the King ouercame, and Perosus was put to flight: who for his sauegard forsaking hys Countrie, betooke himselfe to the Mountaines: where after hee had long traueiled, hee by chance met with Bessarian transformed, as afore wee haue told you, who hauing some what recouered himselfe after the wounds of his sonnes, fearing least his foe should at his sight flie away, layes sodaine holde vpon him. At which Perosus beeing afraid seeing himselfe assailed, gins make all the meanes hee could for hys escape: but the other loath to requite him euill for hys ill dealing, in steede of such rauinous behauiour, as commonly is found in such like beasts, gently fawnes vpon him, shewing himselfe rather willing to helpe him, than readie to hurt him. When Perosus calling to mind hys former offence in the bewitching of the old man, and seeing by the writing about his necke, that this was he whome hee had so cruelly crost, falles downe before him, & with submissiue teares intreats his pardon: to whome the Beare though vnable to speake, yet with dumbe demeans shewing the effect of his minde, answers in dum tokens what he could not tel in plausible words: to whom Perosus there promised, that would hee but follow him, hee would foorthwith conduct hym to the place where hys daughter was imprisoned, & where he hoped also to meet with her, by whose meanes all this was brought to passe. In the meane time Chinon and his fellow knights following their foes from the fight, by chaunce intercepted Eutropa the Witch as shee was flying awaie, whome presently they intending to kill, & shee knowing very well their crueltie, fell downe before them, humbly asking pardon for her life, and in requitall thereof shee would restore to liberty, her for whose sake Chinon had suffered all this extreamity, than which Chinon desiring nothing more graunts her requests, whome shee presently transportes to the place where Cassiopea lay imprisoned: where when they came, they found her three brethren dilating vnto her theyr seuerall ill luckes, whome as soone as they came, the Witch released from the bondage of the Rocke, and falling downe on her knees askes hartie pardon for her amis, to whome the Lady glad of her release straight forgiues that offence, and then Eutropa telling her the great perrill Chinon had ouerpassed for hir love: shee with all curtesie falles downe at hys feete, submitting her selfe for requitall thereof to be disposed at hys pleasure, whom he taking vp from the ground, offering himselfe like wise to her. In the meane time whilest these folkes were thus reioycing, comes in Perosus leading of the transformed olde man, and humbly there asking pardon of
