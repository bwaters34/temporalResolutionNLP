 and yet I assure you my good wil striueth to counteruaile his curtesie, but had I the precious pearles of Patroclus, or the golden Sandes of Ganges: I could finde in my hart to make you the owner of them, as wel as I haue chosen you to be the patron of my trauaile, vnder whose buckler of defence I haue comitted my Book to the printers presse, but because I will obserue decorum, and auoide teadiousnes, this sinode and solemne parliament holden of the Gods and Goddesses in sacred Olympus, shall reueale a plain and simple method, the occasion and effect of Phillips Uenus, the which as time and leasure, setting aside your searious affaires, shall permit you, I am fullye perswaded you will throughly peruse and reade: that doon, I trust you will giue your censure in such sorte, that heereafter I may be incouraged to publish some other treatise, which may further delight you. Thus leauing you to the mercifull and gratious protection of the almighty, I bid you most hartily farwell. Your woorships to commaund Io. M. auntient for antiquitie: was there holden a regall and princelike Parliament, by the sacred Synode of all the Gods and Goddesses. The cause of their sitting, was by reason of a great slaunder raised through the outragious follyes of that vaine and wanton Venus, whom by a common consent for her ficklenes, was banished the compasse, circuit, and scope of the stately and orient Heauens. She exiled, the Senate was quieted, contentions allayed, and all things well pacified: but as there is no counterfaite without his blemish, no blossome but hath her blast, nor flower without his branne: so to that commoditie, was added this discommoditie: that her seate being now voide of a soueraigne, her place of a Princes, and garde of a Goddesse: caused Cupid to care, Mars to mourne, but Vulcan to smile: rumours ranne throughout the Senate, and priuie mutterings heard, in euery Session dayly billes were exhibited by the Amorous, and the Louer pleaded for his Ladye as he would haue doon for his life: there might you haue seene the sadde lookes of the Ladies, the heauye countenance of many a carped Knight, and like Aesops frogs so importunate for a Queene, that had not Iupiter been in a merry mood, twenty to one it had made him starke madde. At the last, (for what will not inuocations intreat, and dayly praiers obtaine) it was decreed by the whole house, that an election should be made to supplye the want of a Godde, and satisfie the petitions of the people, and thus it was. There was among the seemely train, attending the Goddesse Diana, a Nymph of such passing beautye and singuler vertue, that I may doubt whither to commend in her the exterior shape of the body, or interiour habite of the minde: her sad countenance or sage counselles: her modesty, gestures, or merry glauncings, the sharpenes of her wit, without wantonnes or sweetnes of her speech, without wilfulnes, the attire of her bodie was comely, yet not too costly: her ornaments all seemly, yet nothing superfluous: for the most parte so singuler, that she excelled all other of her sex, in all things so rare, that she seemed rather a Saint, then a subiect: and to write without partialitie, who euer behelde her, would rather iudge her a mate for the greatest God in heauen, then a companion for the mightiest Monarche on earth: more like Phoebus Sister, then her seruant: and better beseeming a Goddesse, then the hand maide of a Goddesse. This Dame was by birth royall, in behauiour curteous, bearing a shape importing her owne name Venus, the modesty of her Mistresse Dyan, pallas wit, and Iunoes maiestie, Lucretias faith, with Artimesias loyaltie: In stature not of the tallest, but indifferent in all proportions, nothing meane but absolute and excellent: so that should I note with my pen the halfe of her perfections, I should therin erre with my pen, and sinne in peeuishnes. This seemely Saint or rather gallant Goddesse (for what was it her beautye might not promise? and her vertues performe? my Venus attending the entraunce of the Capital, the interuent and comming of her Lady Mistresse, was not so happie as wished for, espied of the mightye Iupiter, who beholding hir bountye, but admiring her beauty: so farre excelling the rest her fellowe Nimphes in brauerie, as the Sunne in brightnes exceedeth phoebae, or phoebae in bignes the little Boetes, walked vp and downe as halfe in a mamering, deuising some strange shape to entertaine his rare Mistresse. Now adioyning to the entrance of the Capital, was there an outward chamber curiously hung with a stately Arras, wrought with golde and richlye beset with Turkasses, Saphires and Diamonds, as best beseemed the maiestie of so braue a place, and the presence of so heauenlye persons: heere before they entred the Capitall, which was richlye embost with roofes of beaten gold, and pillarde with Iet, round wrought and beautified with Emeralds and Crisocolles, did the Gods make their firste obuent, and decke them with robes wherin they sat the day before in the Senate. In this place sat all the waiting Nimphes, attending the comming of their Ladye Goddesses: and as that time fell out, mistrusting the house would sit longer then their accustomed manner: desputed how to driue the day in some merry method, wherin euery one past her censure, till Venus in the midst gaue after this manner her sentence. Ladies (quoth she) and my fellowe Nimphes, to make a long processe to little purpose, or to vse many woords to little woorth, were but to pull Hercules shooe on a Childes foot: to burne one Candle, in seeking another: to exercise our tungs, fill our eares, but deceiue our expectations: to talke of warre, were too vnseemelye for women of Science, not fitting our sexe: what then? Loue, that in trueth best is beseeming Ladies, and sithence we all studie which way to passe the time, let vs all conclude to vse some merry pastime: whereto all agreeed, and liked so well of the motion, that without further speeche, they made vp the match, and saide it should be loue: Their order was thus, she that cunningly and most comely could courte little Ganymede, should be mistresse of her fellowes, and Ladye of Loue for that yeere: and by whome should the triall be, but by the Boyes troth, that being tyed to his fancy, might all rest vnder his fauour, and whom Ganymede said I loue, to her should fall the lot. Now was the Boy at the nether end of the Chamber, whither it were knitting of true loues knots in rishes to try his wits, or making of Puppits to passe the time I wot not: but Venus skipping lightlye from her seate, ran hastily to the childe, and catching him in her armes, kissing the prittie wagge, placed him with the women. Ganymede whither gessing shrewdly at the matter, or groping subtilly (as the wanton well could) at womens mindes: why Venus saide he, will you rauish me before all this companye, or rifle me amid this crue? it becommeth not Nimphes of Dians train, to entermeddle with Pages of Iupiters troupe: fire and water agree neuer in one vessell, it is dangerous to cast flax to fire, Apples to Children, liberty to Louers, were it not for the place Venus, I would hardly like your practise: Coy elfe (quoth Venus ) are you so collerick? no Venus, (answered Ganymede ) take heed you wax not frantick, for women speake not vntill they be spurred, but put once out of their meane, then are they past all mean, because you should not fall into a mischeefe by reason of idlenes: I did but whet your wits Venus, to finde you exercised, for this age is wicked, subiect to many euilles, and the house sitteth long, and I wist not how you would spend the daye: to courte Ganymede, saide Cyane, and why so? replyed Ganymede, to whet your minde or my manners: bothe answered Venus, for by our controuersie shall Ganimede finde our conceite, and by thy iudgement shall we know Ganimedes wit: if that be all Ladies (saide he) begin when you will, Ganimede is with you and for you. Haue with you then quoth Cyane, and Ganimede let this exordium be for you. Where the late adultresse Venus was wrapt with desire of her faire Adonys, no bird nestled her brest but beautie: when in pride of her dietie, she graced Phao with an extraordinary fauour: what was the greatest gift but beauty? and what Venus I wot not striuing in thy nature Ganymede to excell her Art, hath more then naturally inriched thee with a hue of greater (if greater may be) then excelling beautye: if Venus were with her owne woorkes taken, no meruaile then if Cyane be with so exceeding a power ouer-taken: I loue Ganimede, sweete Ganimede I loue, I loue thee, yea thee, a fairer then whome, is not contained in compasse of our Sphere, or of greater beautye, no one resteth heere in Olympus: if the Gods for a fauour of their inferiours to enrich them with any blessing of liberalitie, graunt them loue: if our Ladye mistresse in fauour to their Gods, haue no greater graunt then loue: if loue made the King of our Capitall become little Cupids captiue, driue Iuno to ielousie: and Cynthia though she seeme surely to smile sometime on her welbeloued Endymion: but if Ganimede in my disputation grauiled, make any doubt of my deuice: Mars, Neptune, yea Pluto and wise Apollo himselfe, shall satisfie him in loues perfections and praises. Thus I loue Ganimede, yea Ganimede I loue, then let not Ganimede repaye for loue, hate: but carying beautye in his forhead, harbour Excomesis loue in his hart: for beauty long since and loue were both conioyned in an endlesse league of amitie: if beautifull, then is Ganymede louelye: and therefore louelye because beautifull, ah wittes Cyane, what ambiguitie doubtest thou in Ganymedes loue, that shineth so orient in pride of his beautye, but admit beautye were not Cyane. Yea marye, saide Ganymede, heer I ioyne with Cyane, for admit no beautie in Ganymede: yet answered Venus (standing by) bereaue not Cyane of her beautye Ganymede, for it is her life: nor of life Dorye another Nymph standing by, least you loose her loue: I admit them (concluded) Ganymede, both Cyans beautye and life: because she shall not perrish in her loue, all this is but a pause saide Venus, to bring Cyane to her purpose: yet hardly answered Cyane shal I proceede, if you thus penne me from my purpose: howbeit to make vp her medlye, forward she goeth in this manner. Let not the modesty of thy yeeres sweet Ganymede, frustrate the desart of my praises, but lengthen my life with thy beauty, thou wilt grace my beauty with thy loue: vnfitting were it, faire Iupiters Page should now become foule ingratitudes Prisoner: I tell thee Ganymede, to forget iniuries is not the meanest poynte of wisdome: to rewarde desart, the highest type of a true Trophea, whither was Alexander more famed for his victories of the worlde, or infamous for the slaughter of his faithfull Clytus ? ingratitude I tell Ganymede hath frustrated mightye Princes of the loue of their people, hath decayed Kingdomes, and ruinated the weale of the happiest worlde: if any Ganymede coulde but discearn what difference there were in remundicating a sweete desert, and practise of a scorning desire: what destinction betweene a pleasant replye, and a displeasing repulse: greater should be his sweetnes exercised in these vertues, then others vertues practising no such sweete. He that hath read the Trophies of the Romain triumphes, shall there finde in a Princely breast, a princelike bountye: who for the purchase of ease, repaies with rewarde of life: perfourming a regall office in a Lyons nature: well may he be tearmed a King, that Kinglye dealeth with his vassailes: shewing that in greatest personages, ought to harbour greatest vertues. Sweet mouse, in this let me intreate thee resemble Aesops mouse, that as he with his teeth released the Lyons thrauldome, thou with thy tung vntye thy Goddesse bondage: ease her thoughts, whose hart fainteth with the burden of thy beautye: and make thy soueraigntie rather pleasing by thy liberality, then indurate through thy tirannie: so shalt thou be honoured with thy inferiours, praised by thine equalles, and loued of thy superiours: carrye with thy Lyons lookes a Lyons minde: who being King ouer my thoughts, become princelike in thy deedes. And is there among mortall wights a thing of more immortall resemblaunce then loue? deuine are his causes which worketh deuine effects, and a matter without compare for forme, whose incomparable forme maketh so rare a matter: were Aristotle heere to deuine his principio, or Plato to distinguish of his cause: they both would recant their blinde ouer-sight, and consorting them with me, commend my braue in-sight: look about Ganymede, and beholde this goodlye Theatrum of the heauens, praise the Skyes with those glorious Lampes of thine, and ouerviewe the base earth, and tel me if either farre or neere, aboue or belowe: there be any thing of greater compare then vnitie. Seeste thou not what a heauenlye hermonye there is of celestiall, reunited by great art to vpholde a great charge, where nothing is superfluous, eche one serueth orderly the other, the Sunne imparteth her light to the Moone and Starres, the Moone and Starres with due proportion lymiting times and seasons: bodies belowe gouerned by powers aboue: yea, there liueth not one person, but is guided by a Planet: one is crossed with aduersity, he hath felt the fury of angry Saturne: another liueth pleasant, fast bound in wedlockes sacred bandes: who doubteth whither Iuno hath shewed her his fauoritie, some fortunate in enterprises, some I account safe sholded with the maiestie of Iupiter, other some triumphant in the conquest of their Ladies loues: then earst our Venus flattered in her pride, and this is too manifest a preheminence ouer th'inferiours, to ye end they might honor and loue their superiours. Now let not Ganymede born on the earth, but nursed in the heauens: loued of the Gods for his beautye, but honoured among men for his dietie, become vnnaturall, so goodly graced with all the ornaments of a deuine nature: if neither the earth that bread thee can challenge any of her right, yet let the heauens that harbor thee, receiue somewhat for their due: then least striuing to become more then a God, thou proue lesse then a man: repugne not heauen and earth, least being an enemye to ye one, thou proue odious to the other and lesse fauourable to me, scarse acceptable to thy selfe: be not so straite laced Ganymede in thy conceite, nor haue no selfe will which engendreth a selfe woe: carry in thy sweete bodie a sweete minde: content is greater riches then a Kingdome, and loue nothing inferiour to life: be as thou seemest, a God for beautye, and seeme that thou oughtest, to be more then a God for thy bountie: imitate him, whose commaundes makes him thy maister Iupiter, and be not coye to thy mistresse: accept the courtinges of Iuno, the one shall enrich thee with great honors, the other honor thee with fortunate matches. Heer would Cyane no doubt haue continued a long content, had not Ganymede (turning to Venus ) interupted her processe with this parliance. Beleeue me Venus, Cyane hath laid on loade for her loue, and hardlye she galleth me for ingratitude: but concearning the beauty she treateth off, I neither yeeld the conceite, nor consent: but tell me Venus, is not Cyane a merry wench? it is but her custome Ganymede, and nothing strange among vs Nimphes saide Venus, to be pleasant. But tell me Venus (replyed Ganymede ) are all Nymphes thus pleasant? yea, answered Venus, al pleasing Nimphes, of the which number now striueth Cyane to be one: and I allowe her contention, if you allow it: Ladies (saide the Boye) then must Ganymede needs like it, yet will I reserue a further sentence, till I heare further saying. Heere Dorys because she saw Cyane interrupted, sitting in a grater muse, burst suddainly into these tearms of purpose to raise mirth: Ganymede (saide she) women men say, are of their first louers passing coy, of their last passing curious: feare causing the first, loue the latter: whither of these I wist not, Cyane is fallen into, so that if you suspence some censure, you depriue Cyane of her sence. Clymen another Nimphe standing by, replyed vpon Dorys in this manner: not of sence, but of conceite: she hath doon so superlatiue well, that I iudge her wrapt into a second heauen. Cyane hearing them descanting thus on her plaine song, to marre their musick rowsed from her muse, and with a stearne gesture, such as women vse when they are waspish: thought to conclude her tenor in some discording tune, had not the house disagreeing on certaine poyntes, suddainly been dismissed, and they compelled by constrainte to attend their Lady Goddesses, where I must leaue them to their seruice, my selfe tyed to their secrets: whom because I may not reueale, for that they belong to women, I will rest with Phaebus, and expect Auroras glad appeare. By this had Tytan tane his restie Stoedes, and traced them vnto his Chariot, when Mercurye ye swift winged messenger saluteth him from the King of Gods after this manner. Faire Phaebus saide he, from my Father loue I haue to greete thee, and thus it is: he craueth thy presence to sit with him in Parliament: shall, saide Apollo, then faire Terra be of her light be reste? not so (answered Hermes ) for this day the heauens as earst with sable cloudes shal ouer mantled be: so that thine absence is no misse to men, & yet as acceptable will it proue to the Gods: & to auoide Dame Tellus distemperature, my Father will dispose a plot that best may fit their profit. Short tale to make, it was not long before that all addresse and betake them to their sollemne counselles, whose decrees because they egresse my purpose, they must exceede my pen, Qui supranos, nihil ad nos, Starres may be poynted at, but not pulled after: me list not treate of the secrets of Gods, being the mean of al men: nor intermeddle with the heauens, least with the Typheonis I be ouerwhelmed in the earth: I had rather sit in the Sunne with Irus, then rule the Sunne with Phaeton: creepe on the earth with the Ant, then soare in the heauens with Icarus: I leaue the Capitall too high for my capacitie, and returne to the great Chamber where are sitting my merry companye, whome maye I smoothely bring to this daies end. I shall performe such a taske as will glad me foreuer. Dorys and Clymen haue gotten them to a corner of the Chamber, as it should seeme to talke of their late nightes rest, or early mornings rising: Venus alone in a bay windowe was busie beholding the faire fruites of Flora, who in great brauerie adorned a garden plot prospectiue in the Chamber lights: Cyane no sooner entred the presence, but she began to descant on the former daies parliance, and with the very sight of the place renued her old passions: Ganymede (his Lord yong Ops, now newly entred the Capitall, because he would not sit expecting the aduent of his adherents) had no sooner recouered the Chamber, but pryed for his companions, who that day were to holde the chat: and soothelye to say, had not Ganymede driuen Cyane from her dumps, verye mellenchollye of minde had brought her to her death: which sadde comfort when Ganymede had well viewed, he fell immediatly like a prittie wagge into his olde vaine of wantonnes: running in all the haste to Cyane, crying arme, arme, arme: Cyane halfe amased, skipt soddainly from her seate, and Clymen with Dorys brake off their silent whispering, when Venus at his woords began to turne from the windowe, seeking the author of this sodain alarme, who espying Ganymede encompassed with the companye, with her siluer voice resoundeth these wordes, the messengers of her conceipte. In faith (Sir wagg) come you so suddainlye crying for armes? no doubt by that all haue said, you wil shame your arte: be it with shame or honor Venus saith he, I will bring it all to end: Nyphe, Hyale, and Ramys, with all the rest of the Nymphes, being at the neather end of the Chamber, and beholding them conuocated in a cluster, not vnlike their former daies order, mused much of the match, and drewe something neer to vnderstand the matter, the which by diuers circumstances hauing gathered sitting eche by her fellow, expecting what would be the greeting: whose presence Ganymede beholding, fearing euery one to cast in her verdict, which in his opinion seemed verye vaine, began with this caueat to giue them all the canuas. Ladyes saide he, I being heere elected as iudge, adiudge on paine of my displeasure, no one Nymphe open her lippes to speake among this presence, except Dorys, Cyane, Clymen, and Venus, wherewith euerye Ladye repast her laughter, demaunding Ganymede to whom he would graunt his leaue: to Dorys answered Ganymede, wherefore speake Dorys be it but to winne the praise. Dorys looking Ganymede steadye in the face, beholding his countenance and ye rest of her crue, between earnest and iest, shot foorth her bolte in this or the like bente. Cyane in her yesterdaies courtinges, grounded her gratious loue Ganymede on thy lookes, measuring thy bounty, by thy beautye: but of a contrarye censure frame I my fancye by thy fame: preferring thy witte before anye other woorthinesse, my reasons in a woord are these. The chaste Penelope chose not the great Lord of Ithica for his wealth, but his wisdome: nor Andromache, Hector for his valure, but his vertue: so tooke Sulpedia, Lentulus: and Hypperstria wedded the Philosopher Crates, infinite were examples, should I dwell in their repetition, being extant in wit, and tryed by experience: I wil not heere enter in the discourse of wit, but leaue you to suppose it greater then it is by coniecture, then finde it lesse then it ought to be by triall: but this haue I heard diuers men say, being my selfe but a woman, that wit bewitcheth, when wealth wearyeth: Inuention and disposition Rethoritians tell me, are two diuers things by their diuers rules, not so hard is the inuention in getting, as the disposition in keeping when it is gotten: Kingdomes are easier conquered, then kept: and Lordships sooner purchased then loue: one thing is cast away in a moment, that was not composed in a moneth: Troye was but a day burning, that was tenne yeeres conquering: the foolish fisherman that let the Eeele slippe through his hand into the water, was not so glad of his taking vp, as sorrowfull for his slyding downe: the giftes of fortune are transitorie, tyed to no time: the giftes of nature permanent, during in all times. I account it heere no fault my Ganymede to be beautifull, but a commendation to be wittie: nor scorne I him that hath wealth, but honor him that is wise: wit wil get wealth, but wealth shal neuer purchase wit: and yet both wit and wealth agree in the brauest sympathye: counsell maketh the meanest comelye, but comlynes sildome or neuer counselleth: and yet comelynes where is good counsel, is a grace that giueth the brauest grace. I remember a Gentleman in my time mouing an Italian question to an English Louer, referred him in his choise to the election of three changelings: the first a faire foole, the second a wise wanton, the third a crooked Saint: because of euery one he hath discussed so well, I shame to say any thing except I could do better. Hyperchyon neuer strained his voice after he heard Orpheus play on his Harp: the Black-birde represseth her notes where the Nightingale sound out her layes: I could heere recite to Ganymede, the commodities and pleasures reaped by the profit of wit, were not the repetition needlesse, being already known, and the knowledge manifest, taught by daylye experience: what attempteth not wit? what causeth not wit? what offereth not wit? which discouereth the eminence of euils, and is a soueraigne medicine to recure their maladies, tryeth the secrets of Ladies thoughtes, and entreth conqueror into their daintiest hartes. Agamemnon had a kingly grace, but Paris a courtely gesture: Aiax fought hard for Achilles honors, but Vlysses pleaded better that got away his armour: why preferred Cornelia a poore Miller before a wealthye Mizer: and Cyrca a bell to enchaunt many millions of men to dispell her enchauntments, shewing her selfe too much like a woman. Shall I tell Ganymede what the famous Epyrote Pyrrhus could doo with his wit, and eloquence of Blundus entituled Roma Triumphanta, doo not deceiue me, who saith, that this Pirrhus was so eloquent and wise, that the man with whome once he had spoken, remayned so much his, that from that time forward in his absence he tooke his parte, and declared his life in presence: the saide Blundus also saith, and Tytus Lyuius affirmeth the same: that as the Romaines were of all things provided (seeing he was of so rare wit and eloquence) for him were they so prouided, that no Romaine Ambassadour conferred in his presence, but by the mediation of a third person, otherwise he would so allure them with his sweet woords, that they returned perfourming matters of little woorth. And there-vpon I conclude that Ganymede being wittie, must be beloued of Ladies by constraint, and honoured of duetye: So now Cyane affectes Ganymede for his beautie, Dorys for his wit thy countenance making a breache ( Ganymede ) into Cyanes brest, thy wit woorking wonders in Dorys thoughts, if therefore Ganymede be beloued for his beauty, shall he be hated for his wit? if for his outward shadowe, why not then for his outward vertue? for by that time beautye hath cast her Cardes with indifferencye, she shall want many an ace of wit. Heere Dorys very earnest to haue proceeded to her purpose, was interrupted by Clymen, with this merrye processe. Your wit Dorys is so good, that if we make you not to pause, you will make vs pant: what, what now Dorys ? wit whither wilt thou? Ganymede to giue Clymens clause a close with this verdue, cast in his verdit: Dorys saide he in wit, is a Doctor, who to proue me for wit singuler, giueth vs occasion to thinke Dorys for wit past compare: I would I were Dorys, so wise to finde womens wyles, or my owne weaknes: then turning no further then led by reason, I need not for want of iudgement incurre such Ladies rage. Venus perceiuing Cyane all this time so mute, who earst was euer wont to be merry, thought by some prittie deceit, to haue driuen her from her pensiue conceit, between mirth and game vttering this glose: while you treate of wit, others talke of warre: you are amid your mirth, but Cyane mornes with melancholye: trust me the Ladye either feedes on pilles, or on displeasure, her taste seemeth so vntoothsome: why how now Cyane ? I pray you Lady what cheere? Cyane was stung with Venus tale, and though at firste she began to stand, yet bethinking her selfe better, she recouered her strength, & because none should know where the showe wrong, but she that wore it, with this prittie glose plaied on her game: I haue fed Venus (said she) too rife on Dorys reasons, so sweet is her fruite as if she bore foorth Figges: Heereat Dorys thought to catch Cyane at the nyck, requiting her curtesie with this prittie quippe: Cyane (answered she) euer caryeth a sweete tooth in her head, and a sweet thought in her hart, beauty breedes no other, loue as much. Heere Iupiter hauing been something earnest in certain causes discussed in the Capatal, sodainly rose from his seate, forsaking the Senate: the rest he commaunded to tarrye, because he would haue further triall, leauing the alone to haue a sight of his loue: softly therfore discended he the Capitall; and vnawares stealeth down on the merry knot sitting in the great chamber, who beholding the little Senate of pettie Nimphes and Damosels, bit the lippe in conceite, but by your leaue changed countenance: for such was Venus presence, that alwaies moued Ioues patience: yet because his changing should be perceiued of none, he entred a with-drawing Chamber by, not perceiued of any, calling in all the hast to Ganymede: and ye rest of the Nymphes being earnest in their discoursings, gaue little attendance to Iupiters intercourse, so that he passed by them into the chamber before he was seene or heard of any, but when the Boy had once heard the voice of his Lord, it was no time to wil him hye ore the lappes of his Ladyes, but as if Aeolus droue him with the blast of his breath: so lightly forsooke he his company and his bench. Iupiter his page no sooner entred his presence, but began in these tearmes to salute his pettie person. Sir wagge (said he) you are amidde the women when you should attend my will, beholding others braueries, but neglecting my businesse: I beseeche you Sir, what Nymph was she that attended your right hand while I passed by the left. Ganymede remembring it was Venus, and accordingly, infourmed his Lord, reporting her to be an attendant on Dyctymia. Venus (answered Iupiter ) haue we been two daies seeking Venus in the Capitall, you hauing stolne her out to sporte with you in the great Chamber? I thought (saide he) her some rare personage being adorned with so rare perfections. Hye you therefore to the Senate, and tell the Gods (for this day) I adiorne the Session: Ganymede as was his Lordinges message, hasted him to the Capitall to enforme the his maisters minde: vpon the hearing wherof, all the house rose seeking no further reason. By this the Debyan God had discharged his fierye courses, betaking him to the bower of his beloued Thetis, it was no time for Nymphes to chat of loue, when their Mistresse to stop their mouthes, had abridged the of their leisure: they moreouer poore soules so weary of their late nightes ouer-watching, are so drowned in sleepe, that there is not one waking: and for my parte I so greatlye tender a womans ease, that rather then I would wake them, I will refuse mine arte: a sweete smyling kisse of a Ladyes sleepye lippe, I account farre greater treasure then a largis at a mighty Emperours hand: rest you therfore (sweete loues) secure, voide of troubled thoughts, while I trouble others to coniecture of your sugred mindes. Now was it time when Cynthia forsaking her siluer Orbe, had left the whole Zoane vnto Apollos charge giuing leaue to Zephirus to prouide for Aeolus passage: the Nymphes now risen attend their Ladyes call, and hasten forwards for their mistresse quick dispatch: short tale to make, each entred the Capitall, earnestly expect the comming of their King: I will heer repeat the accidents hapned with mighty Iupiter, if any can entreate Ganymede, I dare warrant my life he shal hear of much prittie sporte: the boye and his Lord long ere this are supposed lost, and Gods graunt it my fortune to pronounce them happie found. Saturnus soon after diuers sportings with ye Paphlogoman youth his Page, now mindeth ye Senate, and is entred the presence: whether no sooner come, but narowly he pryeth to haue a sight of his new sweet hart Venus: what need I heere to note Iupiters loue, wherin none are ignorant, acquainted with his life, his close courtings, glorious glaunces, and prittie practises: I rather leaue them to others, whose studies haue made them famyliar with his factions, then vndertake the charge too chargeable for my fortunes: his trewanting from Olimpus, when more meeter he had beene in the heauens: and metamorphoses of shapes, because he would not be knowen on earth: all these are better descryed by the prying of Iuno, then the penning of a nouice such as I, whose eares haue neuer yet made me priuie of such experience, nor whose experience euer attained such priuities: but thus suppose, that if euer he loued any, he loued Venus, and Venus more then any: if euer he desired any he desired Venus, and my Venus desired he before any: if euer he metamorphosed himselfe for any, he metamorphosed himselfe for Venus,  & for Venus was he more strangely metamorphosed the for any: if he fained him self Aethra to obtain Calisto, now sought he a more maidenly shape the Aethraes to be conuersant with my Venus: if in habite of Dyane he deceiued ye Nymph Nonacris, what shape sought he the think you to deceiue euen Phaebe her selfe? he entertained not so many golden Actions, when he begat the famous Porsey, as he did the golden thougts at the view of his exceeding Venus. I dare not holde him long thus doting on his Goddesse, least wanting in the Senate, I encurre the hatred of the Gods and exercising Pentheyes contempt: I endure Pentheyes punishment. He passeth on now to parliament expected of his Peeres, and my crue are now clustred entending their purpose: Ganymede hasteth Venus to vndertake her promised charge, and giueth charge to the Ladyes none interrupt Venus heste. And now being silent, the royall crue of Carthage, the Ilyan stranger greeteth Dydo after this semblaunce. Lycurgus (saide Venus ) the Lacidimonians lawe giuer, had neuer liued renowned in Greece, had not his lawes obserued, maintained the state of Greece, and him self in Greece framed his life correspondet to his lawes, the lawe maker must be no Law breaker: and he that gouerneth others, is then more wise, when rightlye he ordereth himselfe: infamous is that bird, that peruerting the law of nature (as saith the olde adage) defileth her owne nest: what Pallamides had driuen Vlisses from Greece, had not Tellemacus care reuealed his Fathers cursse: and what Ganymede compelled Venus to display her imbecilities, had not Venus own sentence pronounced her repented follies. Pardon me Ladies and Ganymede excuse thy Venus, vnwilling though I am to enter these vnacquainted actions: the Painter feathereth not the Shafte, ne the Fletcher handleth not the Pencell: who setteth the Asse to the Hare, or the Puttocke to the Partridge: The stock of Grapegraftors tell me, suteth not with the syence of the Medlar: nor is the stalke of a Thorne naturall for the graffe of a Pippin: the Gillyflower twise set, groweth double by art, when simply sowen, she springeth single by nature: long is it or the Mastie be taught to retriue the Partridge, or the Hound of the Kitchin, to maintaine chase after the Hare. I shall but deceiue you (sweet Nymphes) that expect matters of strange compare from Venus, when strange it is any matter at all should distill the wits of Venus: if you would Vlisses wit, serch Homers tomes: if Aeneas valiant acts, read learned Maroes Aeneads: Galen shall giue his goods, Iustinian honours, and loue who seekes, let him searche the auntient house of proud Halyan sulmo. But I heare these Ladies say that Venus prescribed an edict, but wil you tye me to necessitie? the is your law (Ladies) without lawe, because grounded on necessity: yet hearken faire Nymphes, Venus shall not be coye without a cause: nor hauing cause, contend to be curious: if you haue vouchsafed of curtesie to vndertake Venus motions, Venus for your sake shall straine all her vaines, either for an appologie, or an apostacie. Ganymede must be courted say you, and Venus saith Ganymede, and none other must court him: shall I iniurie Ganymede of his loue, or these Ladies of their praises? no, Ganymede shall participate of my loue, but to satisfie his list and these Ladies, my reasons be it to yeelde them their rights. Oh how well spake Cyane, (Ganymede) in praise of thy beauty, and how eloquent Dorys in commendations of thy wit: the first an argument of great force in Ladies mindes, the latter a rare spectacle in womens manners: both these so excellent, concluding their arguments, that shame will it be to me in shewing my arte. Shall I like Apelles boy seeking to mend the Nose, mare the Face: or the foolishe Fletcher exceeding my bounds, deface the forme of my bolt: O how rude shall Venus reasons seeme, among those propositions of Dorys and Cyane, yea Cyanes beauty ( Venus will imblasen thy deformetie: and Dorys wit, discouer thy follies. Yet Nymphes and sweete Ganymede, pardon me, and regarde my necessitie: if Venus wantonly wander it is but for necessitie: if she digresse, necessitie: if she erre necessitie: whatsoeuer Venus dooth, none dooth excuse her, and accuse necessitie: but such burthen pleaseth these Nymphes to oppose on Venus, Ganymedes beautye I both admire and loue, and cannot indeed indifferently praise it, his wit, I reuerence and adore: and cannot rightly commend it, all things in Ganymede excelling Venus skill: and Venus skill too base to vndertake Ganymedes brauerie, vnlesse some Dorys or Cyane vouchsafe him their censures. But Venus must speake, and what speaketh Venus (Ladies) but your prayses? whose wit so rare in defining Ganymede, haue edified you, and eternized Ganymede. Had Bellerophon lefte labour after conquest of the Chymery, or left him quiet after conquest of the Solynye: Perseus Palfreye had not beene his poyson, ne the exercising Pelagus lynes prised so deare, as with the losse of Bellerophons life. Ah me vnhappy Venus, that necessitie being voide of lawe, should tye me to the performaunce of a law: and soaring beyond my pointe, fall to my vtter perdition. If I loue Ganimede, I must praise Ganimede: if I praise Ganimede, then for his perfection must I praise Ganimede: perfecter may Ganymede then beautye can make him, what is then left Venus (vnhappie Venus ) wherin Ganymede to praise thee, when Dorys and Cyane haue in all partes so brauelye emblazoned thy praises? In all things there is but good, and bad: right, and wrong: little, or great: but bethinke thee Venus, Aristotle as saide Cyane, treating de principiis, declareth them three: and Tullye de locis deliberatinis, other three: honestum, vtile and possibile: vnder vtile ( Ganimede ) I conteyne thy beauty, honestum thy wit: but whither wilt thou wander Venus, for thy possibile ? Aristotle saith in his Ethicks, that in all things diuisible, there is something more, something lesse, something equall: more or lesse, what can there be then beauty and wit? or of greater equalitie? But Marcus speaketh of a mediocratie, and that wil he haue his vertue. Well found indeede Venus, thy vertue Ganimede beares away the bell, thy beauty either with the Sommers Sunne is scorched, or the Winters storme blasted: thy wit, age weakeneth, or sicknes preiudiceth: thy vertue ( Ganimede ) neither the force of Phaebus parching rayes can enter, nor Brumaies foggie moysture attainte: which like the Cedars in Etla neuer rot, or the Daphnean Lawrell neuer wither: keepeth with the pure Cyuet his sweete sauour, and the tried Adamant, his perpetuall hardnes. What maketh men on the earth famous, in their graues glorious, in the heauens immortall? but vertue. This made Caesar a mighty Emperour on earth, honoured for a God in heauen, eternized Scipio for a Saint, and that inuinsible alsydes worthily woorshiped vnder title of an heauenly Heroes. Glad am I Ganimede although occurrent with these Nimphes, I yet finde some argument at the least something discrepant from these Nymphes wherein I confesse I shall but auere your reasons (Ladies) though exercise mine own wits: wit saide I, too meane (faire Sisters) to be inserted in your disputations, and too base mettall Ganimede, to incorporate with thy deuine matter: whose naturall proclinitie approueth my disputation vnnaturall Sophistrie: yet Ganymede is my loue, nothing lesse then these my Sisters, though my beauty be inferiour, my desire is as great: though my wit be so greene, all that I can say is vertue the handmayden of the Gods, and sole mistresse of men: vertue ( Ganymede ) which beautifieth thy beauty, and couereth thy rare wit to an absolute wisedome, directeth thy course in this life, adopting it to be a further life. What, shal I shew thee the necessitie heerof to th'attaining the summum bonum of Cicero, or the absolute pathway to the felicitie of Aristotle: all these are better knowne by the writinges of learned men, then the assertions of an effeminate woman: better taught the ignorant by experience, then the learned by reading: so amply euery way, that I cannot with indifferency commend it any way, for if he haue knowne any thing: who can conceale this from Ganymede ? if he haue read any thing, what is after viewed by Ganymede ? By this I hope Ganymede conceiuing good opinion of my loue, will yeelde me for a fauour, one iotte of good lyking: and though I cannot challenge nothing by deserte, yet bestowe one fauour of Venus of almes: which if Ganymede of fauour, and these Nimphes of pitie shal graunt: Venus, will doo homage to these Nimphes, and reporte Ganymede onely gratious. but, Yea but (saide Ganymede ) and none but Venus hath hit the butte and the white: Clymen shall keep her reasons close. And for that close (said Clymen ) I bequeathe Ganymede content, thankes and praiers to Ganymede, that so prudent hath discharged the disgrace of Clymen. No disgrace Clymen, saide Ganymede, but a dismission, knowing your sufficiencie such, as better can answer learned arguments, and easier argue in greater exercises. As for this task, I thinke it so fullye perfourmed, that attend these Nymphes my sentence: onelye Venus caries away my censures. If any thing in this my iudgement more then reason, or lesse then wit, displease these pleasing Goddesses: I flye no farther for fauour then the lymits of your fancyes, whose vrgent opportunitie, haue offred this thaklesse opportunitie: but sithence you haue annexed to my loue a lotte: making my woords oracles, and my saying a sentence: I will with one lyppe you pronounce Venus my loue, striuing no farther for maistrie, but accept her for mistesse: heere with so sweete consent possessed these Ladyes contents, that with full voice they cryed all Venus, Venus, Venus. Now rowsed horned Hamon from his Chaire of state, and at the name of Venus all the Senate stoode, thinking the late exiled aduldresse had aproched mauger their deities, to exhybite her appeale: the caster of the fearefull lightnings, stormes, and thundereth deadly inward sighes, and threates as if Lycaon were to sustaine new sentence for his sinne: or the earth bread his thundenboltes in reuenge of their boldenes: the very sight amazed the Senate that saw him carry terrour in his browes, a secret silence passed through the house, and Ioue that storming expected strange newes remembreth now Ganymedes exercise, and Venus name. Now hath Iupiter peace in his hart, mirth in his countenance, loue in his minde: the Gods smyle to see their king so pleasant, and the whole sinode as it were sung for ioye to beholde him so merrye: he beckeneth forthwith to the louely Sonne Maya, sending him into the great Chamber with this message, that Ganymede should present him with his Venus to quiet his minde, and the others variaunce. The Gods which yet knewe not Iupiters minde, looked strangelye on Iupiters message: but hearing Iou treate of a conclusion to their variance, they were all willing to welcome Ganymedes Venus: thus being earnest fixt the eyes of euery person: Ganymede after this manner bringeth in his present. Firste entred Hermes with a statelye pace, as if he manned Bryseis to her Uirgins bowers: then issued on the gallant Ganymede, a Lawrell wreathe within one hand, his loue fast by the other: then all the Nymphes her fellowes within whose hands sweete Oliue palmes they beare, as if they then attend Dyana to chase, walking along the sweete Thessalyan Playnes: or els the Muses trauailing Hellicon, when they met the adulterous Thracian Pyrew. How might I heare depainte Venus praise, or declare the delight taken in her presence, such as haue felt the full excesse of ioye shall decide this doubt, whome I make my Iudges. Iupiter commaundes his Page to declare the order of their pastime: and controuled their vanities, that made such outcrye on Venus. Ganymede describeth his Lord the whole circumstance of their iesting, and saide Venus vertue had merited a iudgement, desiring the whole house if he had made a sinne, without further pause to reuoke his passed sentence. What should I write heere the wonder of the Gods and Goddesses gathering by Ganymedes talk such hope of Venus graces: I referre you to the sequell, how regarding her absolute vertues the whole house pronounced a second sentence, redoubling Venus, Venus, Venus. The ruler of the Welkin secretlye triumphes to see his purpose sorte of good effect: commaunding Latona and
