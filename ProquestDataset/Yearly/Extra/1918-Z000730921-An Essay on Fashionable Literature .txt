 for many reasons, and afford a subject of speculation which may be amusing, and I would add instructive, were I not fearful of terrifying my readers in the outset. As every age has its own character, manners, and amusements, which are influenced even in their lightest forms by the fundamental features of the time, the moral and political character of the age or nation may be read by an attentive observer even in its lightest literature, how remote soever prima facie from morals and politics. VI. The newspaper of the day, the favorite magazine of the month, the review of the quarter, the tour, the novel, and the poem which are most recent in date and most fashionable in name, furnish forth the morning table of the literary dilettante. The spring tide of metropolitan favor floats these intellectual delici ae into every minor town and village in the kingdom, where they circle through their little day in the eddies of reading societies. VII. It may be questioned how far the favor of fashionable readers is a criterion of literary merit. It is certain that no work attracts any great share of general attention, which does not possess considerable originality and great power to interest and amuse. But originality will sometimes attract notice for a little space, as Mr. Romeo Coates attracted some three or four audiences by the mere force of excessive absurdity: and the records of the Minerva press will shew that a considerable number of readers can be both interested and amused by works completely expurgated of all the higher qualities of mind. And without dragging reluctant dullness back to-day, let us only consider the names of Monk Lewis and of Kotzebue, from what acclamations of popular applause they have sunk in a few years into comparative oblivion, and we shall see that the condition of a fashionable author differs very little in stability from that of a political demagogue. [VIII. Mr. Walter Scott seems an exception to this. Having long occupied the poetical throne, he seems indeed to have been deposed by Lord Byron, but he has risen with redoubled might as a novelist, and has thus continued, from the publication of the Lay of the Last Minstrel , the most popular writer of his time; perhaps the most universally successful in his own day of any writer that ever lived. He has the rare talent of pleasing all ranks and classes of men, from the peer to the peasant, and all orders and degrees of mind from the philosopher to the man-milliner, of whom nine make a taylor. On the arrival of Rob Roy , as formerly on that of Marmion , the scholar lays aside his Plato, the statesman suspends his calculations, the young lady deserts her harp, the critic smiles as he trims his lamp, the lounger thanks God for his good fortune, and the weary artisan resigns his sleep for the refreshment of the magic page. But we must not anticipate.] IX. Periodical publications form a very prominent feature in this transitory literature:---To any one who will compare the Reviews and Magazines of the present day with those of thirty years ago, it must be obvious that there is a much greater diffusion of general talent through them all, and more instances of great individual talent in the present than at the former period: and at the same time it must be equally obvious that there is much less literary honesty, much more illiberality and exclusiveness, much more subdivision into petty gangs and factions, much less classicality and very much less philosophy. The stream of knowledge seems spread over a wider superficies, but what it has gained in breadth it has lost in depth. There is more dictionary learning, more scientific smattering, more of that kind of knowledge which is calculated for shew in general society, to produce a brilliant impression on the passing hour of literature, and less, far less, of that solid and laborious research which builds up in the silence of the closet, and in the disregard of perishable fashions of mind, the strong and permanent structure of history and philosophy. X. The two principal periodical publications of the time---the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews \--- are the organs and oracles of the two great political factions, the Whigs and Tories; and their extensive circulation is less ascribable to any marked superiority, either of knowledge or talent, which they possess over their minor competitors, than to the curiosity of the public in general to learn or divine from these semi-official oracles what the said two factions are meditating. XI. The Quarterly Review and the Courier newspaper are works conducted on the same principles and partly by the same contributors. These are the hardy veterans of corruption. The British Critic , the Gentleman's Magazine , and the [ blank space in MS .] are its awkward squad: the Antijacobin Review and the New Times are its condemned regiment. XII. The country gentlemen 1 appear to be in the habit of considering reviews as the joint productions of a body of men who meet at a sort of green board, where all new literary productions are laid before them for impartial consideration, and the merits of each having been fairly canvassed, some aged and enlightened censor records the opinion of the council and promulgates its definitive judgment to the world. The solitary quack becomes a medical board. The solitary play- frequenter becomes a committee of amateurs of the drama. The elector of Old Sarum is a respectable body of constituents. This is an all-pervading quackery. Plurality is its essence. The mysterious we of the invisible assassin converts his poisoned dagger into a host of legitimate broadswords. Nothing, however, can be more remote from the facts. Of the ten or twelve articles which compose the Edinburgh Review , one is manufactured on the spot, another comes from Aberdeen, another from Islington, another from Herefordshire, another from the coast of Devon, another from bonny Dundee, etc ., etc ., etc ., without any one of the contributors even knowing the names of his brethren, or having any communication with any one but the editor. The only point of union among them is respect for the magic circle drawn by the compasses of faction and nationality, within which dullness and ignorance is secure of favor, and without which genius and knowledge are equally certain of neglect or persecution. XIII. The case is much the same with the Quarterly Review except that the contributors are more in contact, being all more or less hired slaves of the Government, and for the most part gentlemen pensioners clustering round a common centre in the tangible shape of their paymaster Mr. Gifford. This publication contains more talent and less principle than it would be easy to believe coexistent. XIV. The monthly publications are so numerous that the most indefatigable reader of desultory literature could not get through the whole of their contents in a month: a very happy circumstance no doubt for that not innumerous class of persons who make the reading of reviews and magazines the sole business of their lives. XV. All these have their own little exclusive circles of favor and faction, and it is very amusing to trace in any one of them half a dozen favored names circling in the preeminence of glory in that little circle, and scarcely named or known out of it. Glory, it is said, is like a circle in the water, that grows feebler and feebler as it recedes from the centre and expands with a wider circumference: but the glory of these little idols of little literary factions is like the many circles produced by the simultaneous splashing of a multitude of equal sized pebbles, which each throws out for a few inches its own little series of concentric circles, limiting and limited by the small rings of its brother pebbles, [while in the midst of all this petty splashing in the pool of public favor Scott or Byron plunges a ponderous fragment in the centre and effaces them all with its eddy: but the disturbing power ceases: the splashings recommence, and the pebbles dance with joy in the rings of their self-created fame.] XVI. Each of these little concentrations of genius has its own little audience of admirers, who, reading only those things which belong to their own party or gang, peep through these intellectual telescopes, and think they have a complete view of the age while they see only a minute fraction of it. Thus it fares with the insulated reader of a solitary review: the inhabitants of large towns, the frequenters of reading rooms, who consult them en masse [ sentence unfinished in MS .] XVII. In these publications, the mutual flattery of "learned correspondents" to their own "inestimable miscellany" carries the "Tickle me, Mr. Hayley" principle to a surprising extent. XVIII. There is a systematical cant in criticism which passes with many for the language of superior intelligence; such, for instance, is that which pronounces unintelligible whatever is in any degree obscure, more especially if it be really matter of deeper sense than the critic likes to be molested with. A critic is bound to study for an author's meaning, and not to make his own stupidity another's reproach. (The Edinburgh Review and Excursion and Christabel .)---How very ill Pindar would have fared with these gentlemen, we may readily imagine; nay, we have sufficiently seen, in the memorable instance in which he appeared incognito before a renowned Gr aeculus of the critical corps. XIX. This instance occurred in an article on one of the most admirable pieces of philosophical criticism that has appeared in any language: Knight's Principles of Taste . One of the best metaphysical and one of the best moral treatises in our language appeared at the same time. The period seemed to promise the revival of philosophy: but it has since fallen into deeper sleep than ever, and even classical literature seems sinking into the same repose. The favorite journals of the day, only within a very few years, were seldom without a classical and a philosophical article for the grace of keeping up appearances: but now we have volume after volume without either, and almost without any thing to remind us that such things were. XX. Sir William Drummond complains that philosophy is neglected at the universities from an exclusive respect for classical literature. I wish the reason were so good. Philosophy is discouraged from fear of itself, not from love of the classics. There would be too much philosophy in the latter for the purposes of public education, were it not happily neutralised by the very ingenious process of academical chemistry which separates reason from grammar, taste from prosody, philosophy from philology, and absorbs all perception of the charms of the former in tedium and disgust at the drudgery of the latter. Classical literature, thus disarmed of all power to shake the dominion of venerable mystery and hoary imposture, is used merely as a stepping-stone to church preferment, and there, God knows, Small skill in Latin and still less in Greek Is more than adequate to all we seek.--- XXI. If periodical criticism were honestly and conscientiously conducted, it might be a question how far it has been beneficial or injurious to literature: but being, as it is, merely a fraudulent and exclusive tool of party and partiality, that it is highly detrimental to it none but a trading critic will deny. The success of a new work is made to depend, in a great measure, not on the degree of its intrinsic merit, but on the degree of interest the publisher may have with the periodical press. Works of weight and utility, indeed, aided by the great counterpoise Time, break through these flimsy obstacles; but on the light and transient literature of the day its effect is almost omnipotent. Personal or political alliance being the only passports to critical notice, the independence and high thinking, that keeps an individual aloof from all the petty subdivisions of faction, makes every several gang his foe: and of this the late Mr. Wordsworth is a striking example. XXII. There is a common influence to which the periodical press is subservient: it has many ultras on the side of power, but none on the side of liberty (one or two weekly publications excepted). And this is not from want of sufficient liberty of the press, which is ample to all purposes; it is from want of an audience. There is a degree of spurious liberty, a Whiggish moderation with which many will go hand in hand; but few have the courage to push enquiry to its limits. XXIII. Now though there is no censorship of the press, there is an influence widely diffused and mighty in its operation that is almost equivalent to it. The whole scheme of our government is based in influence, and the immense number of genteel persons, who are maintained by the taxes, gives this influence an extent and complication from which few persons are free. They shrink from truth, for it shews those dangers which they dare not face. The legatur of corruption must be stamped upon a work before it can be admitted to fashionable circulation. XXIV. In orthodox families that have the advantage of being acquainted with such a ph aenomenon as a reading person (which is fortunately as rare as the Atropos Belladonna---a hunting person, on the other hand, a much more innocent variety, being as common as the Solanum Nigrum---) or any tolerably literate variety of political and theological orthodoxy---the reading of the young ladies is very much influenced by his advice. He is careful not to prohibit, unless in extreme cases---Voltaire, for example---who is by many well-meaning grown ladies and gentlemen in leading-strings considered little better than a devil incarnate. He is careful not to prohibit, for prohibition is usually accompanied with longing for forbidden fruit---it is much more easy to exclude by silence, and pre-occupy by counter-recommendation. Young ladies read only for amusement: the best recommendation a work of fancy can have is that it should inculcate no opinions at all, but implicitly acquiesce in all the assumptions of worldly wisdom. The next best is that it should be well- seasoned with petitiones principii in favor of things as they are. XXV. Fancy indeed treads on dangerous ground when she trespasses on the land of opinion---the soil is too slippery for her glass slippers, and the atmosphere too heavy for her filmy wings. But she is a degenerate spirit if she be contented within the limits of her own empire, and keep the mind continually gazing upon phantasms without pointing to more important realities. Her province is to awaken the mind, not to enchain it. Poetry precedes philosophy, but true poetry prepares its path.---See Forsyth.--- XXVI. Cervantes---Rabelais---Swift---Voltaire--- Fielding---have led fancy against opinion with a success that no other names can parallel. Works of mere amusement, that teach nothing, may have an accidental and transient success, but cannot of course have influence on their own times, and will certainly not pass to posterity. Mr. Scott's success has been attributed in a great measure to his keeping clear of opinion. [But he is far from being a writer who teaches nothing. On the contrary, he communicates great and valuable information. He is a painter of manners. He is the historian of a peculiar and remote class of our own countrymen, who within a few years have completely passed away. He offers materials to the philosopher in depicting, with the truth of life, the features of human nature in a peculiar state of society, before comparatively little known.] XXVII. Information, not enquiry---manners, not morals---facts, not inferences ---are the taste of the present day. If philosophy be not dead, she is at least sleeping in the country of Bacon and Locke. The seats of learning (as the universities are still called, according to the proverb, "Once a captain always a captain") are armed cap-a-pie against her. The metaphysician, having lifted his voice and been regarded by no man, folds up his Plato and writes a poem. XXVIII. The article of the Edinburgh Reviewers on Mr. Coleridge's Christabel affords a complete specimen of the manner in which criticism is now conducted, and certainly nothing but the most implicit contempt for their readers, and the most absolute reliance on the prostration of public judgment before the throne of criticism, could have induced them to put forth such a tissue of ignorance, folly, and fraud . The last is a grave charge, but it is the worst and the most prominent feature of modern criticism: for as to ignorance and folly, they are by no means criminal, and are perhaps indispensable in critical journals, for whose non integra lignea wisdom and learning would be too heavy ballast. But neither ignorance nor folly, nor any thing but the most unblushing fraud, could have dictated the following passage. Crimine ab uno disce omnes . [ It is obvious that at this point---though his MS . supplies neither quotation nor reference---Peacock intended to insert the following passage from the Edinburgh Review for September , 1816 , Vol . XXVII , p. 64: \--- "One word as to the metre of Christabel, or, as Mr. Coleridge terms it, ' the Christabel'---happily enough; for indeed we doubt if the peculiar force of the definite article was ever more strongly exemplified. He says, that though the reader may fancy there prevails a great irregularity in the metre, some lines being of four, others of twelve syllables, yet in reality it is quite regular; only that it is 'founded on a new principle, namely, that of counting in each line the accents, not the syllables.' We say nothing of the monstrous assurance of any man coming forward coolly at this time of day, and telling the readers of English poetry, whose ear has been tuned to the lays of Spenser, Milton, Dryden, and Pope, that he makes his metre 'on a new principle!' but we utterly deny the truth of the assertion, and defy him to show us any principle upon which his lines can be conceived to tally. We give two or three specimens, to confound at once this miserable piece of coxcombry and shuffing. Let our 'wild, and singularly original and beautiful' author, show us how these lines agree either in number of accents or of feet. 'Ah wel-a-day!'--- 'For this is alone in---' 'And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity'--- 'I pray you drink this cordial wine'--- 'Sir Leoline'--- 'And found a bright lady surpassingly fair'--- 'Tu---whit!---Tu---whoo!'"] Now Mr. Coleridge expressly says: Though the syllables may vary from seven to twelve the number of accents will be found always the same: i . e . four. If the reviewer had had the common candor which characterises even the lowest of mankind (reviewers excepted), he would have stated Mr. Coleridge's assertion truly, and then have disproved it if it had appeared erroneous. Mr. Coleridge asserts that lines of any number of syllables from seven to twelve contain alike four accents, and [nothing can be more] true: and how does the reviewer disprove this assertion: He first omits the limitation, and makes him say what he never said, that all his lines contain the same number of accents; and then placing lines of four and fourteen ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) syllables in contact. Can any one suppose that the suppression was not wilful? That a man would copy one half of a sentence, the whole of which he could not disprove, and argue against the half as if it were the whole? Could any man do this under any supposition but that of wilful and fraudulent misrepresentation? Or would any man have ventured to do it if he had not felt conscious that in his capacity of critical purveyor he was catering not for liberality and taste but for envy and malignity? XXIX. Reviews have been published in this country seventy years: eight hundred and forty months: and if we reckon only on an average four numbers to a month, we shall find that in that period three thousand three hundred and sixty numbers have been published:  2 three thousand three hundred and sixty numbers, two hundred thousand pages, of sheer criticism, every page of which is now in existence. What a treasury of information! What a repertory of excellent jokes to be cracked on an unhappy author and his unfavored publications! So it would seem. Yet on examination these excellent jokes reduce themselves to some half dozen, which have been repeated through every number of every review of the bulk of periodical criticism to the present day (and were stale in the first instance), without apparently losing any portion of what Miss Edgeworth would call the raciness of their humour. They were borrowed in the first instance from Pope, who himself took one or two of them at second hand. They have an everlasting gloss, like the three coats in the Tale of a Tub . XXX. One of these is the profundity of the Bathos. There is in the lowest deep a lower still, and the author in question (be he who he may) has plunged lower than any one before him. Another is that the work in question is a narcotic, and sets the unfortunate critic to sleep. A third is that it is unintelligible, and that true no-meaning puzzles more than wit. A fourth, that the author is insane. It cannot be denied that this is super-excellent wit which can bear so much repetition without palling, for there is not any number of any review which does not contain them all at least once, and sometimes six or seven times: but taking them only at an average of one in a number, they have been repeated three thousand three hundred and sixty times in seventy years, and so far it is demonstrated that they are three thousand three hundred and sixty times better than the best joke in Joseph Miller, whose brightest recorded repartees will not bear a second repetition. XXXI. This ready cut and dried wit, thus stamped with eternal currency, is very convenient to a trading critic who has no wit of his own; and when all this mighty artillery is concentrated in a single article, the great hand of fulminating Jove is armed with a thunderbolt indeed. Tres imbris torti radios , etc . The reviewer of Christabel accordingly has seized them all, and launched them at the devoted head of his Capaneus, Mr. Coleridge.--- (three extracts and parallel notes.) XXXII. Lord Byron had, it seems, in a singularly original collocation of words, characterised Christabel as a "wild and singularly original and beautiful poem." This unfortunate phrase proved a tid-bit for the critics, who rung the changes upon it with infinite whim. ["''Tis the middle of night by the castle clock, And the owls have awaken'd the crowing cock; Tu---whit!---Tu---whoo! And hark, again! the crowing cock, How drowsily it crew.' 'Sir Leoline, the Baron rich, Hath a toothless mastiff bitch; From her kennel beneath the rock She makes answer to the clock, Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour; Ever and aye, moonshine or shower, Sixteen short howls, not over loud; Some say she sees my lady's shroud.' 'Is the night chilly and dark? The night is chilly, but not dark.' It is probable that Lord Byron may have had this passage in his eye, when he called the poem 'wild' and 'original;' but how he discovered it to be 'beautiful,' is not quite so easy for us to imagine."] The critic does not condescend to alledge any reason for his disapprobation: he knew well that his readers would not require any, but on his magisterial affirmation would take it for granted that the passage was naught, without exercising a grain of judgment for themselves.---But with all due deference to this Aristarchus, let us examine the culprit on whom he thus summarily pronounces. Christabel is a ballad romance, a tale of wonder and mystery told with the simplicity of our elder minstrels, who depict every scene as it were passing under their eyes, and narrate their most marvellous legends with an unaffected bonne foi , that shews a mind fully impressed with the truth of its own tale. They never destroyed the appearance of self-persuasion by too much minuteness of detail, and a perpetual pausing to explain and account for every thing. They seem to tell as much as they know, and leave it to be supposed that there is much more of which they are ignorant. Their language is always that of circumstantial evidence, never of complete and positive testimony. (Note. Sir Patrick Spence ). Their style is at once simple and energetic, unincumbered with extraneous ornaments; the natural expression of distinctly conceived imagery, rising and falling with the elevation or homeliness of the subject. Such is the style and the language of Christabel . The poet relates a tale of magic and mystery, as one who is himself perplexed by the dark wonders which have passed under his own knowledge. The poem is a succession of scenes, and every succession or change presents as many visible or audible circumstances as the fancy can comprehend at once without vacancy from their fewness or confusion from their multitude ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) (note Homer Milton etc . as opposed to Chaucer and his modern imitators.) The first scene, the castle at midnight, is characterised by a few circumstances at once original and true to nature. And the regular howl of the dog, under some unknown supernatural influence, prepares the reader at once for a supernatural tale. "Much of the art of the wild writers consists in sudden transitions---opening eagerly upon some topic, and then flying from it immediately. This indeed is known to the medical men, who not unfrequently have the care of them, as an unerring symptom. Accordingly, here we take leave of the Mastiff Bitch, and lose sight of her entirely, upon the entrance of another personage of a higher degree, 'The lovely Lady Christabel, Whom her father loves so well'---" This short sentence is admirable in many ways. We have the three thousand three hundred and sixtieth repetition of the fourth standard joke, which insinuates that the author is insane; and secondly, a profound discovery that all poetry is mad that is not monodramatical, and that any person or object, once brought on the stage, must remain in constant view to the end without being displaced by any other; and that consequently Shakespeare in his Macbeth , having eagerly opened upon three witches, and made us immediately lose sight of them on the entrance of another personage of a higher degree, King Duncan, thereby gave an unerring symptom that he ought to have been forthwith consigned to the care of Doctor Monro. "The lovely lady Christabel...... Who it seems had been rambling about all night---" The poem neither says nor implies any such thing. Christabel has just left the castle and walked into the wood: Extract from the poem: then from the criticism.--- With "the key that fitted well": the expression Homeric: note on " I wis " and " all in the middle of the gate:" Lady G. then sinks down "'belike through pain;' but it should seem more probably from laziness." This is misrepresentation again: Geraldine is a witch who designs evil to Christabel: this is obvious enough throughout: She cannot pass the threshold of the castle, nor afterwards of Christabel's apartment, unless Christabel herself be the agent of her transition ( ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Eve of St. John, etc .)--- She therefore in both instances sinks down on the threshold apparently from weariness ( ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The poet says "belike through weariness" in the character of one who sees the action and does but guess at its cause) and Christabel, so interpreting it, lifts her over it. She then walks on as she were not in pain: implying that the conjecture "belike through weariness" was unfounded. The supernatural powers of Geraldine, the evil which she intends to Christabel, etc., etc ., are always told by implication: the whole effect of the poem would be destroyed were they told in any other manner ... "too much tired to speak"---? ... It is the implication of a charmed sleep, and of the consciousness on the part of the sleeping dog of the presence of an evil guest. The critic could scarcely be so stupid as not to see this, but it is wonderful how far a little understanding can be wholly darkened when its whole attention is directed, not to understand a work, but to disparage and misrepresent it ... "a dram of some home-made liquor" ... O weary lady, Geraldine, I pray you, drink this cordial wine! It is a wine of virtuous powers; My mother made it of wild flowers ... now would this passage to any but a genuine and bona fide garreteer capable of pawning the very book he was reviewing for a glass of brandy---have suggested any such idea as that of comforting themselves with a dram! "Like a lady of a far countree From which we may gather among other points the exceeding great beauty of all women who live in a distant place, no matter where." The true meaning of the passage is obvious: She was most beautiful and had the air of a foreigner. The conjunction was superfluous and would have marred the passage,---without checking the critic's predetermined ridicule: for this species of wit is the cheapest of all, and can find abundant food in the most perfect compositions, as we shall presently shew. "---a very dark spell, which we apprehend the poet manufactured by shaking words together at random; for it is impossible to fancy that he can annex any meaning whatever to it." Here we have the third standard joke, that the passage is unintelligible: but the critic has shot his bolt too soon, according to the proverb, for the passage is scarcely obscure, and is indeed intelligible to the meanest capacity, though seriously perhaps not to our reviewer's. This is the whole of it.--- Explain it.--- "To understand what follows, we own, surpasses our comprehension." The third standard joke again. ... "The Baron falls into a passion, as if he had discovered that his daughter had been seduced; at least, we can understand him in no other sense, though no hint of such a kind is given; but, on the contrary, she is painted to the last moment as full of innocence and purity. ---Nevertheless, 'His heart was cleft with pain and rage, His cheeks they quiver'd, his eyes were wild, Dishonour'd thus in his old age; Dishonour'd by his only child; And all his hospitality To th' insulted daughter of his friend By more than woman's jealousy, Brought thus to a disgraceful end---'" Surely none but an idiot could truly misunderstand this, and yet I am inclined to take the critic at his word, and believe that he really did; but the meaning is manifest. Christabel brings the Lady Geraldine and tells him all that it is in her power to declare, etc ., thus recommending her to the baron's hospitality, and shortly after, without any obvious reason, desires him to send the woman away. The Baron's heart is cleft with rage for the disgrace thus brought upon his hospitality, which was the chief of virtues in those days: he is dishonored in his old age by his daughter's violation of hospitality: he attributes this to jealousy of the parental kindness with which he had received the daughter of his friend, and which, if it had been Christabel's true motive, would have been indeed more than woman's jealousy, and therefore---extr: I blush for an age of literature in which any one can require an explanation of so plain a sentence; still more for an age in which any one can come forward and tell the public that, in the grovelling stupidity of his intellect, he cannot understand what is intelligible to a child, and that for this very declaration he shall be held an oracle. Truly this is like what Locke tells us of Egypt, where complete and incurable idiocy is a title to divine honors. "Nothing further is said to explain the mystery; but there follows incontinently, what is termed ' The conclusion of Part the Second ' And as we are pretty confident that Mr. Coleridge holds this passage in the highest estimation; that he prizes it more than any other part of 'that wild, and singularly original and beautiful poem Christabel,' excepting always the two passages touching the 'toothless mastiff Bitch;' we shall extract it for the amazement of our readers---premising our own frank avowal that we are wholly unable to divine the meaning of any portion of it." The third standard joke for the third time.--- "'A little child, a limber elf, Singing, dancing to itself, A fairy thing with red round cheeks, That always finds and never seeks; Makes such a vision to the sight As fills a father's eyes with light; And pleasures flow in so thick and fast Upon his heart, that he at last Must needs express his love's excess With words of unmeant bitterness. Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together Thoughts so all unlike each other; To mutter and mock a broken charm, To dally with wrong that does no harm. Perhaps 'tis tender too, and pretty, At each wild word to feel within A sweet recoil of love and pity. And what if in a world of sin (O sorrow and shame should this be true!) Such giddiness of heart and brain Comes seldom save from rage and pain, So talks as it's most used to do.'" Obscure this probably is---unintelligible it is not--- at all events the meaning of portions of it is sufficiently plain. "A little child" etc . down to "light." So far there is no difficulty to any one but our reviewer. "And pleasures---bitterness---" The meaning is still obvious, though the fact may be questioned that a father, contemplating his playful child, will experience pleasure so excessive that the ordinary language of pleasure cannot express it, and he therefore of necessity borrows the language of bitterness to express the excess of his love. So far as the use of such terms "little lovely rascal" etc . this is certainly true. "Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together" etc . "To dally with wrong that does no harm." which is certainly the case when excessive affection prompts the employment of such language. "Perhaps 'tis tender too, and pretty," to "pity." As if there were an injustice in employing such terms at all, though the language of ordinary affection can find none sufficiently forcible. "And what if in a world of sin" etc . The fact that words of bitterness are often employed to express excessive affection being assumed, the cause is then surmised: The state of excessive love and delight is a giddiness of heart and brain. But in a world of sin, giddiness of heart and brain is caused more frequently by pain and rage than by love and delight. Therefore when the state of giddiness etc ., which is a habit of pain and rage, occurs from its less frequent cause of love and delight, it employs the language of its more frequent habit, and talks as it is most used to do. The fact may be denied, and if the fact be admitted the solution may be controverted: but the poet's meaning is clear, and the critic who proclaims his own inability to comprehend it, comes forward like Dogberry, and gravely intreats to be written down an ass: and indeed if the voluntary confession of stupidity were in those days, as in ours, the passport to reputation for extraordinary critical acumen and judicial sagacity, honest Dogberry's desire is by no means ridiculous. Metre. "A damsel with a dulcimer In a vision once I saw: It was an Abyssinian maid And on her dulcimer she play'd, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep delight 'twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! And all who heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes with holy dread: For he on honey-dew hath fed." It is extremely probable that Mr. Coleridge, being a very visionary gentleman, has somewhat deceived himself respecting the origin of Kubla Khan ; and as the story of its having been composed in his sleep must necessarily, by all who are acquainted with his manner of narrating matter of fact, be received with a certain degree of scepticism, its value as a psychological curiosity is nothing, and whatever value it has is in its poetic merit alone. But from its having been asserted by the author to have been produced in sleep, it was to be foreseen that the third standard joke would present itself to the critics too naturally to be passed by; that the poem itself would be pronounced to be a narcotic, and to smell strongly of the anodyne, etc . etc .; and accordingly, in every review which I have seen of Christabel , this very exquisite joke has been duly cracked over the head of Kubla Khan . It has been uniformly pronounced unintelligible, especially that passage beginning "a damsel with a dulcimer" etc . As the poem is short, and the manner in which the critics have treated it affords throughout an excellent standard of critical taste and sagacity, I will insert the whole of it, prefixing a number to each sentence as a reference to the following observations. In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. I have read this poem several times over to discover what is unintelligible in it, as intending to explain it for the benefit of the critics, in the hope that when they have got their lesson, and learned to understand it, some of them will condescend to tell us anew what they think of it. For that a man should pass judgment without understanding what is in itself intelligible, is as if a judge should take a nap during the latter half of [a] trial, and waking to give his charge should say to the jury: "Gentlemen, I do not understand the defendant's evidence; therefore you will do well to find for the plaintiff." The jury, if not a special jury, would naturally say, "My lord, if you do not understand the evidence, we do; and are therefore better qualified to give judgment on it than your lordship." I do not believe that to any person of ordinary comprehension, who will take the pains to read this poem twice over, there will appear any thing unintelligible or incoherent in it: indeed there are very few specimens of lyrical poetry so plain, so consistent, so completely simplex et unum from first to last. Bacon. II. 254.
