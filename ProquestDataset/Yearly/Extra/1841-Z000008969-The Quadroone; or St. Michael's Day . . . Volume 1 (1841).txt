MICHAEL'S DAY. BY THE AUTHOR OF "LAFITTE," "CAPTAIN KYD," "BURTON,"  &c. "For me to love is infamy. Heaven-born love---that links the virgin heart To its own noble mate---is not for me, Maiden of a race accursed and outcast. Alas! true love to me is but dishonour; And, ere it bud, must be outrooted, E'en if the heart come with it." William Cutter . IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I. HARPER & BROTHERS, 82 CLIFF-STREET. 1841.

The paper containing this critique was sent to me by a friend; and I need not inform you, "who have written," with what self-gratulation I laid the unction of your words to my soul, and with what avidity I committed every good thing you had said of them to memory. But I was then a fledgling in type, and had never before trusted my wing to fly above the gins and snares that editors spread out to catch young birds withal! To find that I had alighted in safety made me fancy myself in full feather, and henceforth I boldly resolved to take my flight with eagles; in plain words--- to write a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf160v1&image=160-009.jpg) \- external link  - Dedication iv. ] book;  a thing which, in my innocency, I had never dreamed of doing. The result of this valorous determination was shortly afterward made manifest by the appearance, in 1836, of two volumes under the title of "The Southwest." The first book, like the first sin, is the mother to a numerous progeny. While collecting materials for "The Southwest," I chanced to light upon a brief account of Lafitte's romantic abode on the Isle of Barritaria, in the Bay of Caminada. It struck me that it would afford a fine subject for a story of Romance. I went to work; and a novel, which I first denominated the "Buccaneer of Barritaria," but afterward called "Lafitte, the Pirate of the Gulf," was the fruit of my labours. I had now gone too deep in literary transgressions to turn back, and, the CACOETHES SCRIBENDI being strong upon me, I forthwith wrote a third book, on the early career of Colonel Burr, under the title of "Burton, or the Sieges." "Captain Kyd," who did so many wicked deeds "as he sailed," soon after made its appearance. And now the "Quadroone" finishes the list of my offences. Looking upon you, in some degree, in the light of my "Peter in Literis," as having, in a few kindly-penned lines, which, when I afterward spoke of them to you, had quite escaped your memory, imboldened me to aspire to authorship, I now take pleasure in employing the instrument you have contributed to furnish for yourself in acknowledging [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf160v1&image=160-010.jpg) \- external link  - Dedication v. ] my indebtedness, and, with your permission, do hereby cheerfully inscribe your name on the Dedicatory page thereof. With the highest consideration, Your obedient servant, J. H. Ingraham .
