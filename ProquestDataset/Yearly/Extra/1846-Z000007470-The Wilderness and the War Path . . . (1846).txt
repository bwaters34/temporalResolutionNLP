"BOOKS WHICH ARE BOOKS." No. 1.---JOURNAL OF AN AFRICAN CRUISER  0 50 ------ This is the first volume of Wiley and Putnam's "Library of American Books," a new Series of Works by American authors. We have given it more than an editorial reading, and find its sprightly and highly instructive sketches of travel possessed of uncommon interest.--- Balt. Lit. Observer . This is a very clear, spirited sketch of what everybody likes,---nautical adventure,--- heightened by the interest our own Navy always inspires; the scenes being laid in a part of the world as yet free from the tread of tourists. This gives a freshness to the narrative, which the unsophisticated style of the writer does not diminish.--- U. S. Gazette . 2.---TALES BY EDGAR A. POE  0 50 ------ Our readers know him to be one of the most accomplished authors in America. In England he is ranked among the classic writers of the mother tongue. In his narrative pieces he exhibits qualities of mind deemed incompatible with each other---such as a talent for profound analysis, and a most brilliant fancy---a power of rigidly minute and exact detail in description, like testimony on oath; and, contrasted with this, a skill in the "building" of marvelous and grotesque stories, which make the Arabian Tales seem tame in comparison. We are tired of being merely satisfied; and we like occasionally to be astonished . Talent and learning can satisfy. It takes genius to astonish. This Poe possesses, and he has exhibited some of its most decisive proofs in the volume before us.--- Godey's Lady's Book  . 3.---HEADLEY'S LETTERS FROM ITALY  0 50 ------ Mr. Headley is one of the most pleasant of modern travellers---of those, at least, who venture to bestow the results of their travel on the public. He is not only a lively narrator, like Stephens, but a sensible one, who knows just what to describe, and when the proper business of description is over. He sees in the right places, and so agreeably reconciles us to the disagreeables of his experience, as doubly to secure our gratitude for having gone before us in the discovery. His volume, which forms one in the new Library of American authors, by Wiley and Putnam, is not the least meritorious in their collection. He might have made it twice as large with a corresponding increase of value.--- Southern Patriot . 4.---THE WIGWAM AND THE CABIN. By W. Gilmore Simms  0 50 ------ These tales are told in a vigorous, graceful manner, and evince manly feelings with a happy eye for nature. The thoughts grow out of the subject in agreeable proportion; the narrator is no lecturer but our intelligent companion by the way. This volume is a desirable addition to the library of entertaining books, and gives us a lively acquaintance with those parts of the country in which its subjects are located. To the lovers of books describing Indian life and manners, and the perilous adventures of settlers in the wilderness, these collected tales of Mr. Simms will be acceptable.--- Prot Churchman . 5.---BIG ABEL AND THE LITTLE MANHATTAN. By C. Mathews  0 25 ------ `Big Abel and the Little Manhattan' presents, in a pleasant way, a magic lantern view of New York, and will, by its substance and manner, attract many readers.--- Tribune . There is a life and spirit in this lively production that not only renders it attractive, but evinces the power of true genius. Every page attests the great abilities of the young author.--- N. Y. Evangelist .
