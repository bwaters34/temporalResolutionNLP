I, however, may it please Your Majesty, choose [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] rather to go to the fountain-head---the source and grand reservoir of dignity and power---and scorn to skulk behind the outworks, when I flatter myself I may have the good fortune to effect a lodgment in the very citadel itself, under the immediate protection of your most sacred Majesty, to whom, of all potentates, can be justly applied the great maxims: "The king can do no wrong."---"The king never dies." You alone reign by Divine Right: you alone inherit the privilege, and exercise the power of judging the past, directing the present, and presiding over the future. You alone are the great arbiter of living and posthumous fame; for being yourself immortal, it is yours to confer immortality on others. Your empire is self-governed and self-sustained. You require neither fleets, armies, nor armed police, to enforce your decisions, for your fiat is fate. You can set up kings and knock them down like nine-pins; you can make and unmake laws at pleasure; you can make little men great, and great men little: your will, when you choose to exert it, is despotic throughout the nations of the earth, for Your Majesty is the only sovereign that ever existed who could justly boast of universal empire. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] Not only is your power without limits, but your judgment infallible in the selection of favorites, and the bestowal of honors. If you call a pigmy a giant, a giant he becomes; and if you dub a man a fool, the wisdom of Solomon cannot save him from the Hospital of Incurables. The reputation of heroes, statesmen, sages, and philosophers, is entirely at your mercy; you keep the keys of the Temple of Fame, and none can enter without your royal permission. In short, when Your Majesty issues a decree, it must be carried into effect, for with you there is nothing impossible, and all must obey him who is himself all. It is for these, and other special reasons, which I forbear to enumerate, lest I should tire Your Majesty's royal patience, that I have, as it were, turned my back on the rest of the world, and selected Your Majesty as mine own especial Mecoenas, knowing full well you are of all patrons the most munificent and discriminating. May it please Your Majesty then to issue your Royal Bull, directing that no critic shall presume to mangle this my work with a stone hatchet, or dissect it with a butcher's cleaver, unless he can give a good reason for it: that it shall be puffed and trumpeted to the uttermost confines of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] your universal empire, insomuch that it shall go through as many editions as the Pilgrim's Progress, or Robinson Crusoe: that all members of Congress, past, present, and future, shall be furnished with a copy at the expense of Your Majesty, and what is more, be obliged to read it---unless their education has been neglected; that whoever ushers it into the world shall make a judicious distribution of copies; and above all, that Your Majesty will order and direct some munificent Bibliopole to publish it, at the expense of the author. Relying thus on the powerful aid of Your Majesty, I considered it my interest, as well as my duty, to consult Your Majesty's royal palate in the conception and development of this my humble offering; and having been assured by an eminent publisher that Your Majesty relishes nothing but works of fiction and picture-books, I hereby offer at the footstool of your royal clemency a work, which, though it contains a great many truths, I flatter myself they are so dextrously disguised that Your Majesty will not be a whit the wiser for them. If I appear, or affect to appear, as an adviser or instructor to Your Majesty, it is not that I have the presumption to suppose that Your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] Majesty requires either advice or instruction, but because it is next to impossible for an author to dissemble the conviction that he is wiser than his readers. Having, for a long time past, been sedulously occupied studying Your Majesty's royal tastes, I am not ignorant of your preference for high-seasoned dishes of foreign cookery, most especially blood-puddings, plentifully spiced and sauced with adultery, seduction, poisoning, stabbing, suicide, and all other sublime excesses of genius. I am aware also that Your Majesty, being yourself able to perform impossibilities, believes nothing impossible. Possessing this clew to Your Majesty's royal approbation, I solemnly assure you I have gone as far as I could to secure it, with a safe conscience. I have laid about me pretty handsomely, and sprinkled a good number of my pages with blood enough, I hope, to make a pudding. If I have any apology to make to Your Majesty, it is for permitting some of my people to die a natural death, a thing so unnatural that it has been banished from all works of fiction aiming at the least semblance to truth. I am aware, may it please Your Majesty, that it is one of the established canons of critical and other [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] criminal courts, that killing is no murder; and that a writer of fiction is not amenable to any tribunal, civil, ecclesiastical, or critical, for any capital crime, except murdering his own story. But, may it please Your Majesty, I am troubled with weak nerves, and my great grandfather was a Quaker. I am, therefore, naturally averse to bloodshed, and have more than once nearly fallen into convulsions over the pages of Monsieur Alexandre Dumas, whom I consider a perfect Guillotine among authors. In short, may it please Your Majesty, I abjure poisoning, or smothering with charcoal, and confess myself deplorably behind the spirit of this luminous age, which is as much in advance of all others, as the forewheel of a wagon is ahead of the hind ones. Your Majesty will, I trust, pardon the most devoted of your servants, for thus intruding on your valuable time. But it is a notoriously well-established fact that authors are a self-sufficient race, who think themselves qualified to direct Your Majesty's opinions. I therefore make no apology for so universal a failing, and shall limit myself on this head, to beseeching Your Majesty's forgiveness for introducing to your royal patronage so many honest, discreet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] women, not one of whom hath the least pretensions to figure at doctors' commons, the criminal court, or in modern romance. As this is a time when empires are overturned, and potentates exiled by romances and newspapers, I deem it incumbent on me to conclude this my humble Dedication, by assuring Your Majesty that I have not the most remote intention of meddling with those dangerous edge-tools, politics and polemics, any farther than seemed necessary to render probable the conduct of the actors, and the incidents of my story. I solemnly declare that I have no idea of interfering with Your Majesty's regal prerogative; that I have no design against Your Majesty's royal person; that I am neither High-Church nor Low-Church, Socialist, Red Republican, Anti-Renter, Agrarian, or Philanthropist, but a peaceable disciple of the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance in all cases where Your Majesty's prerogative is concerned. One word more, may it please Your Patient Majesty. Not considering myself as writing a historical fiction, or bound by the strict rules of matter of fact, I have indulged in one or two trifling anachronisms, which I refrain from pointing out, in order that Your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] Majesty may have the pleasure of detecting them yourself. I am, May it please Your Majesty, Your most gracious Majesty's Most Faithful, Most Humble, Most Obedient, Most Devoted Servant, THE AUTHOR. Some Account of a Very Ancient and Obscure Family---An Accident which Gives Coloring to a Whole Life---A Conventicle---A Crop-Eared Preacher---A Surprise and a Capture---Danger of Being in Bad Company. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] In the reign of King Charles---courteously styled the Martyr---there resided in an obscure corner of the renowned kingdom of England, a certain obscure country gentleman, claiming descent from a family that flourished in great splendor under a Saxon monarch whose name is forgotten. This ancient family, like most others of great pretensions to antiquity, had gone by as many names as certain persons who live in the fear of the law, but finally settled down on that of Habingdon, or Habingden, by which they were now known. They were somewhat poor, but very proud, and looked down with contempt on the posterity of the upstart Normans who usurped the domains of their ancestors. They had resided on the same spot for more than eight hundred years, during which time, not one of them had ever performed an act worthy of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] being transmitted to posterity, with the single exception of one Thurkill Habingdonne who flourished in the reign of King John---of unblessed memory---and who is recorded to have given one-third of a caracut of land, and a wind-mill, to the priory of Monks Kirby, "to the end," as he expresses it, "that his obit should be perpetually there observed, and his name written in the Martyrologe." But, as hath been discreetly observed, the most miserable of mankind, as well as the most insignificant, would feel still more miserable and insignificant, had he not in a secret corner of his heart, something to feed his vanity or pride. The very beggar will prate of better days, deriving a strange satisfaction from contrasting his former prosperity with his present debasement, and those who have nothing to boast of in the present, or little to anticipate in the future, revert to the past for consolation. Most especially is this the case with those who derive their sole claim to respect from antiquity of descent, and modestly appropriate to themselves all the exploits, good, bad, and indifferent, of their forefathers, although, if the truth were fairly told, there is scarcely one of these residuary legatees of renown, that looks back into the family history, who would not find it stained with actions which, did he really feel himself identified with his ancestors, would light up his face with the blush of shame. But the Habingdons have never figured in the tempest of war, or the dead calm of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] peace, and if they could not boast of illustrious actions, were free from the infamy of illustrious crimes. From the manuscript family chronicle, which commenced with the first of their ancestors who learned to write, and in which were carefully recorded the marriages, births, deaths, and other remarkable events, it appeared that during this long period of eight hundred years, the estate had passed in direct descent from father to son; and that the respective proprietors had, without exception, been once, at least, in their lives, foremen of the Grand Jury. It is also especially noted that in the reign of Henry the First one of the Habingdons repaired a window of the parish church at his own expense; and that another at his death bequeathed a mark to aid in the support of a charity school. The most illustrious of them all, however, was one who was a justice of the peace, and a churchwarden, and who on divers occasions acted as deputy to the high sheriff of the county, as will distinctly appear, from the history of the ancient borough of Slimbridge, now extinct, in five quarto volumes. No wonder the Habingdons were proud of their descent, and eschewed upstart wealth and mushroom titles. Though the original patrimony of the family had, according to the manuscript record, comprised land enough for William the Conqueror to enrich two or three of his beggarly barons, and maintain a stupendous herd of swine, it now consisted of little more than three hundred acres, which the generous Norman had suffered the ancient proprietor to retain as a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] reward for not grumbling at being despoiled of the rest. It was the peculiar hereditary boast of the family, that they had thus, for so long a period of time, invariably held up their heads and maintained their position among the gentry of the county. Whether from some providential dispensation, or that the breed was nearly worn out, is difficult to decide; but it is a remarkable fact sustained by the manuscript record, that not one of the proprietors of the estate, after so great a portion was appropriated by right of conquest, ever had more than two sons. The eldest, in order to keep up the family dignity, was always the sole heir, though by some peculiarity of tenure, the property was not entailed, and of course a gentleman, while the younger, if there chanced to be one, was invariably an idler, and being too poor to marry, lounged about the house and neighborhood; hunted, drank, and Philandered with bar-maids and country lasses, finally died a bachelor, and was buried by the side of his forefathers. The daughters, if not married in good time, usually entered a nunnery, so long as these refuges for desperate maidens flourished in England. If there ever was a family that had preserved a blameless existence throughout so long a period, during which the world had been so often tempest-tossed by political and religious revolutions, it was that of the Habingdons, not one of whom, up to the time in which our story commences, had ever been sus-per-col , or obliged to flee his country for felony, treason, or patriotism. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] The present head of this ancient, though not very illustrious race, was Everard Habingdon, who might lawfully aspire to the dignity of an Esquire, which he justly observed was much more ancient than those mushroom titles which had sprung up amid the corruptions of the feudal system. He was a harmless person; rather reserved, if not actually shy; somewhat of a scholar; a little of an astrologer; still more of an antiquary, and as loyal as a colonial official, as might be expected from the aristocratic pretensions of his family. But there was a still better reason. He had written a book in defense of the Jure Divino , and against toleration, in which he maintained that the desire of liberty was the sole cause of the fall of Adam; that the divine right of kings extended equally to doing wrong; and that princes might with less hazard give full liberty to men's vices and crimes than to their consciences. In short, he was one of those blind, wise men, who imagine that religion and governments will remain the same, while everything around them is changing. After thus publicly committing himself, there was no room for backsliding; and though, next to the laws of Edward the Confessor, he cherished a profound respect for Magna Charta , which venerable old parchment had been not a little signed by James the First, as well as his successor, yet did the old gentleman continue to the end of his days a pattern of loyalty, a perfect exemplification of the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance. It cannot, however, be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] denied that his principles were once grievously assailed on a certain occasion, during one of those "Royal Progresses," not uncommon in the reign of Elizabeth and James, when the sovereign was accustomed to honor certain special favorites with visits that nearly ruined them, his cattle, teams, and laborers were all put in requisition in behalf of the royal vagrant, who was exempted from the ignominy of making compensation by virtue of the prerogative. But with all these foibles of the age, he was in the main an honest, good-tempered man, full of the milk of human kindness towards all mankind, except Crop-ears, Papists, Republicans, and Frenchmen. The posterity of Squire Everard Habingdon was an only son, now just arrived at manhood, who was called Harold, after his grandfather, of whom honorable mention would be here made, had not his life passed like a ship over the sea, or a bird through the air, without leaving a trace behind. They were the last of their race, the father and son. Every other branch of the old family tree had withered, dropt off, rotted, and mingled with its parent dust. The Squire had in the downhill of life committed suicide on the family dignity, after the manner of many discreet old bachelors, and took to wife a buxom, blooming country damsel, who had approved herself eminently useful in keeping his house in order, as well as attentive in time of sickness. And here we must beg permission to remark on the egregious vanity of some would-be wise men, who imagine there is such a thing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] as the enjoyment of perfect freedom in this world, and who therefore studiously avoid entering into the bonds of matrimony, in the hope of escaping that species of government which, though not noticed by Aristotle, or his commentators, is supposed to be of primitive origin. The great law of attraction pervades all nature, and the constituent parts of the universe might as well rebel against it, as man attempt to resist its power. He may for a time, perhaps, escape that species of witchcraft which is the common attribute of women, who have, for that reason, in all ages been singled out as the peculiar victims of superstition and ignorance; but his time must come at last, and some blooming handmaid, or plump, middle-aged house-keeper, will sooner or later avenge her sex by exercising despotic sway over the refractory sinner, who pretended to hold them in defiance. Squire Everard Habingdon is a case in point. Just as he arrived at that age, beyond which it is said a man never improves, the great law of attraction began to operate with irresistible force, and in despite of eight hundred years of uninterrupted, unimpeachable purity of blood, did he marry a damsel without a pedigree, and who, it is greatly suspected, had not a drop of Saxon blood in her veins. By this fortunate slip new life and spirit was infused into the old, lazy current, which had for so many ages slumbered in the bodies of the Habingdons, and thrown great doubt on the theory of Dr. Harvey. There is nothing like crossing the breed; and if the present race of kings, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] throughout all Christendom, would only follow the example of Squire Habingdon, there is every reason to believe their posterity would be both physically and morally greatly improved. Be this as it may, Harold, the sole issue of this union of opposites, was a striking exception to all his ancestors on record, and foreboded a revolution in the house of Habingdon. He was of a hardy, courageous, energetic, and determined spirit; but these qualities, as is not very unusual, veiled themselves under the appearance, and indeed reality, of a cool, quiet, demeanor, approaching humility. Yet the current of his feelings, though it scarcely murmured or rippled, was deep and strong. He had passed some time at Oxford, the most loyal and orthodox of universities; but having tweaked the nose of a scholar who insulted him, and who was son to a nobleman, the patron of sixteen livings and four fellowships, and refusing to apologize, he was expelled as contumacious, and returned home. The Squire, in accordance with his doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance, would have had him attempt to reinstate himself by complying with the requisitions of his college; but Harold, though hitherto the most docile and obedient of sons, demurred on this one occasion, and his obstinacy proved invincible. From this time he occupied himself either in desultory reading, in rambling in lonely solitude, banqueting, or rather starving on his own thoughts, that rose and died away without leading to action, and bearing on his shoulders the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] most grievous of all burdens except remorse---the leaden weight of unoccupied time. Thus he lived, unacquainted with himself and unknown to others; nourishing that quiet, latent enthusiasm which formed the basis of his character, until called upon to mingle in the strife of men, and take part in that terrible conflict now approaching a crisis, between the prerogative of the king and the rights of the people of England. The little estate of Habingdon lay in a remote part of England, where Puritanism had made no inconsiderable progress. Though persecuted by the dominant church according to invariable custom, until the new world set an example of toleration to the old, that indomitable spirit, so essential to the existence and progress of a new sect, which, like a strange bird in a poultry-yard, is sure to unite all the established denizens against it on a first appearance, enabled them not only to resist the tide of persecution, but make, at length, inroads on their persecutors. The milder spirit of the age had abolished the rack, the stake, and the fagot in England, yet the ruling church still flourished the cat-o'-nine tails of star-chamber fines, spiritual censures, imprisonment, stripes, and pillory. It did not actually inflict martyrdom, but contented itself with slitting noses and cutting off ears. Still, like certain hardy plants, that only grow more sturdily for being crushed under foot, the severe doctrines of the Puritans continued to advance as irresistibly as the tide of the ocean, and only rose the higher for the barrier that opposed them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] The elder Habingdon scorned these Crop-ears, as he called them, with his heels, and so did the younger, who had imbibed a deep-rooted prejudice, amounting to antipathy, against these obstinate schimatics, at Oxford, the very hotbed of loyalty and orthodoxy, where it is said pedantry is often mistaken for learning, and bigotry for religion. The retired situation of this part of the country proved, however, favorable to the growth of the new sect, and meetings, known by the opprobrious epithet of conventicles, were occasionally held in the neighborhood. It so happened that as Harold was one morning strolling away from home at random, and without any settled purpose, except, perhaps that of killing time in a retirement that afforded little amusement and less excitement, he unexpectedly came upon one of those unlawful assemblages. He was roused from his reverie, at first, by the distant moanings of a monotonous hymn, that broke on the silence of a calm summer day with a simple melody that harmonized with the scenery around, which exhibited only the unstudied graces of nature in her birth-day attire; and, attracted by the sound, quietly approached the wood whence it proceeded, where he found a number of plain country people of both sexes and divers ages reverently listening to a preacher, so different in appearance from all he had ever seen or heard, that his attention was at once attracted, and he unconsciously became an auditor, notwithstanding his contempt and dislike of his associates. He appeared without any of the insignia of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] Protestant clergyman. Instead of a gown and band, he was dressed in coarse materials fashioned after the garments worn by the country people at this period, and both his language and manners announced that he had not been drilled into the etiquette of the established church. His face was pale and stern, bearing a striking expression of intellectual as well as moral vigor. He wore a black velvet cap, which covered his ears but left his brow exposed, and addressed his little audience in a voice equally melodious and powerful. He spoke of the corruptions of the times; the profligacy of the higher ranks, and the laxity of morals among the people who had been led away by their example. He declaimed bitterly against the innovations of the established church, and the persecution of those who were seeking to restore the purity and simplicity of the apostolic times. To illustrate this last, he reverted to his own labors and sufferings. He bared his arms and showed the marks of manacles on his wrists; he pointed to the stripes he had endured, the scars of which remained indelible on his shoulders; and finally pulling off his cap, the audience, which listened and gazed in reverent silence, perceived that he was destitute of ears. "These," he exclaimed, with almost supernatural vehemency, "these are the testimonials of the sincerity of my faith, and the truth of my doctrines; these are the rewards I have received for following the dictates of my heart and my understanding. These badges of infamy, which in better times marked for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] contempt and abhorrence the lowest, most atrocious offenders against the peace of society and the rights of their fellow-creatures, are borne by one who, though standing as a criminal before the throne of grace, and humbly hoping for pardon, is innocent of any crime against his brother man, for the welfare of whose immortal soul he is ready and willing to lay down his life, and triumph in the sacrifice. For myself I care not, for I knew and was prepared for all, and more than I have suffered. But"---and here he pointed towards a sober-looking matron, by whose side sat a young woman plainly attired---"But look you there--- those whom I love and cherish above all earthly treasures have shared my sufferings and disgrace. They have been dragged from the peaceful fireside of our humble home, and carried away like the daughters of Israel, to herd with criminals, and be insulted by turnkeys and jailors; they have been reviled, outraged, yea, smitten by brutes in the shape of men, and I---I was compelled to look on, unable to afford them help or consolation, except by appealing to Heaven, and offering up my prayers. "But think not, my brethren and sisters," continued he with increasing fervor, think not that I complain of my sufferings in the cause of truth and piety. It is one of the inflexible laws of the Most High that all good here as well as hereafter must be purchased by sacrifices; and as a pure and holy faith is the greatest of all sublunary blessings, so must it be attained by the greatest of all human inflictions. Let none that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] hear me be afraid; let none despair of better times, because they are not already come. Remember that the black cloud charged with the bolts of heaven is the harbinger of a brighter sunshine, and that after wandering through the deep shadows of the cold and chilly wood, we suddenly enter the region of light and warmth. Believe me---I say, be sure that the period is close at hand, when the oppressor shall be laid low, and the beneficent Messiah reign in place of the tyrant." At this moment, when the listening group was wrapt in the silence of breathless sympathy, the preacher was interrupted by a loud voice, exclaiming: "Who talks of the tyrant? He must mean our most gracious sovereign King Charles. Down with the Crop-ear, seize him and his gaping crew. I'll teach him to rail at the king and the church. He shall be hanged for heresy and quartered for treason." A posse of peace officers, as by courtesy they were called, at the head of which was Master Justice Shorthose, the author of the foregoing speech, now rushed forward into the midst of the affrighted group, which was taken by surprise. A few of the most alert made their escape into the wood, but by far the greater number were captured, and among the rest our friend Harold, who had been so wrought upon by the crop-eared preacher that he was completely taken by surprise. But if this had not been the case, he was of a mettle that never stomached running away. The Justice, who knew him well, was one of those pliant [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] tools of power, who have been so often described that it is scarcely worth our while to sketch his character. It is sufficient to say that he was ignorant, servile and tyrannical; and that he had a most stupendous idea of the dignity of his office, considering himself the immediate representative of his most sacred majesty King Charles the First. He recognized Harold among the stricken pigeons, and exclaimed--- "'Slife, Master Harold Habingdon, are you among the Crop-ears? Are you, too, a convert to the whipping-post, the pillory, and the jail? Pray how long is it since you aspired to the martyrdom of losing your ears? Does your worthy father know of your conversion?" To this insulting address, Harold at first scorned any reply; but recollecting the delicacy of his position, and the severe laws against conventicles, he at length condescended to explain his appearance on this occasion in the confident expectation of being released. But he reckoned without his host. Master Shorthose was a magistrate who knew but one law, to wit, the will of his superiors, and held himself bound to carry it into effect without discrimination, though in so doing he outraged every principle of justice. He listened with dignified gravity, and responded as follows: "And so, Master Harold, you came here accidentally, and listened from sheer curiosity. Don't you know that curiosity is a great crime in these perilous times, and that a man listens at the risk of losing his ears? 'Slife, sir, you have incurred a praemunire." "A praemunire, Master Justice? How can that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] be? There is no occasion for warning me to appear, when I am here in my own proper person." "Well, then, you have incurred something quite as bad, and that is all the same. You are caught at a conventicle, listening to treason and blasphemy, and that is, as it were, becoming an accomplice in the eye of the law, being as how it was your duty as a loyal subject to have stopped your ears and run away. I shall carry you to jail with the rest of the elect, but hope, for old acquaintance sake, you will escape without being stuck in the pillory, or losing your ears, like yonder preaching rascal." "Let me tell you, Master Justice," quoth Harold, "let me tell you, sir magistrate"--- "'Slife, whom do you call sir magistrate? I am no knight, that you should thus dub me; and what do you mean by addressing me with, `let me tell you,' as it were in defiance? Let me tell you , sir, that I represent his most sacred majesty King Charles of blessed memory---no, not of blessed memory, but he will be in good time---and that you insult him in my person, which being, as it were, the shadow of the substance of royalty, is equally sacred." "My good sir," began Harold--- "Good sir! 'Slife, do you confound me with the vulgar commonalty, by addressing me as you would a clodhopper? It is as much as telling me I'm no better than I should be." "Well, if you won't hear---" "Well! is that the way you speak to the king's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] representative? Could you not add, your honor, or your worship, or something smacking of mine office and authority?" "In two words, then," answered Harold, half vexed and half diverted at the tenacity with which the Justice asserted his dignity; "in two words, since you demur to my style of addressing you, I shall merely say, that if it so please your worship, I will accompany and make common cause with these good people." "Common cause---good people! Very well, sir, this will bring you within the statute, which says--- Hem---hem. But come, Master Roundhead, march." "I am no Roundhead, and you have no right to call me so," quoth Harold, somewhat nettled. "'Slife, sir, I have a right to call you what I please in the king's name. Come, Master Habingdon, if that pleases you better. You shall accompany me to town with these good people, as you call them. You shall be lodged in jail with these good people, and it shall not be my fault if you don't pay handsomely for being caught in such good company. Come, this is the best way; marry, why? because it is the only one. Come along---I wouldn't be in the skin of your ears for all the fees I have received since the accession of his sacred majesty King Charles the First of blessed---hem!" Saying thus, master Justice Shorthose placed himself at the head of the posse, and marched his convoy, consisting of some eighteen or twenty persons of both sexes, to the neighboring town, where he triumphantly lodged them in prison, there to await the justice of their country.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] As these were times when jails were apt to be crowded, Harold was deposited in the same room with the preacher, who, at the instance of the Justice, announced himself as Israel Baneswright, of Boston, in Lincolnshire, at which his worship rubbed his hands, and exclaimed: "O ho! I've heard of you before. You are famous among the elect for abusing his sacred Majesty through the nose, and dubbing the bishops wolves in sheep's clothing. Instead of calling the Pope anti-Christ, as every good Christian should do, you bestow that title on our great defender of the faith, Archbishop Laud, who I honor next the king himself. You are the man for faith without works, but, i'faith, I'll work you. I see you've lost your ears, but, by good luck, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] your nose is still amenable to the law, and as all your treason and blasphemy escapes through that organ, it is but just it should suffer the penalty." "Say your say, and do your worst, Master Justice," replied Israel Baneswright, "I am prepared to suffer in the good cause, sustained as I am by a power superior to the archbishop or the king. "Hear him!" cried the Justice, in wrath; "Hear him---'Slife, I'll teach the Crop-ear who is the strongest before I have done with him. Clap him in irons, and see that he does not escape by a miracle." "Angels have sometimes ministered to the relief of the saints in time of sore jeopardy," replied Israel, reverently, "and one thing I know, that whatever I am doomed to suffer by the divine will, that will shall enable me to bear." "Hear him again," cried the Justice, appealing to his officials. "The blasphemer has the presumption to question the power of the head of the church, and place his conscience above the authority of the king. Gag the Crop-ear, that he may spout no more treason in the face of the representative of majesty and justice." The officials obeyed with orthodox alacrity, and Master Shorthose departed with his followers, locking the door, and leaving the two delinquents alone. Without thinking of, or perhaps not caring for the consequences, Harold forthwith removed the gag, and the first use Israel made of the recovery of speech, was to thank him for his kindness. Gradually they fell into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] discourse, and Harold perceiving that Israel took it for granted he was one of his followers, immediately undeceived him, by relating the manner in which he had become involved in the same predicament with himself. "You came to scorn us then," said Israel, with a look and tone of mingled disappointment and displeasure. "No," rejoined the other, "not in scorn; I came by accident, and remained from curiosity." Israel paused a few moments, as if communing with the inward man, and seemed somewhat in doubt and perplexity. But proselytism is the invariable concomitant of zeal. In all this world of seeming inconsistencies, there is not such a jumble as that mass of motives which prompts the actions of men and shapes their course of life, which often seems directed by the mere waywardness of the will. Hence many things appear extraordinary and beyond belief, though in reality there is nothing improbable in this world, but actions without motives. Israel Baneswright was the son of a clergyman of the established church, who, besides fattening at a stall in the Cathedral of Durham, held a plurality of livings in various parts of the country, so distant from each other that it was physically impossible for him to perform the duties of shepherd of the flock to all of them. He was both loyal and orthodox in the highest degree, as in duty bound, and having the advowsion of one of his best livings for this his only son, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] had educated him accordingly in the strictest tenets of the Pharisees, as the Crop-ears irreverently called them. After going through the necessary preparation he was sent to the university, where he studied diligently, at times, though his conduct was occasionally not a little irregular. He was exceedingly self-willed, and often took the bit between his teeth, when neither tutor nor proctor could restrain him. Among his fellow students was Oliver Cromwell, whose youth little indicated his future character and destiny, he being at that time more famous for his pranks than his prayers. Similarity of tastes and habits produced a college intimacy between the future Protector and the future field preacher, cemented by various frolicks that subjected them to various degrees of punishment. It is recorded that they once performed together in a play, got up in honor of King James the First, on a visit to the university, called "The Marriage of the Arts," which, according to an old chronicler, "was too grave for the king, and too scholastic for the auditory, (or, as some have said, that the actors had taken too much wine before they began.) His Majesty being heartily tired, after divers yawns offered to withdraw. At length being persuaded by some that were near to him, to have patience till it was concluded, least the young men should be disheartened, he sat down much against his will. Whereupon these verses were made by a certain scholar: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] "At Christ Church marriage played before the king, Least that those mates should want an offering, The king himself did offer---what, I pray? He offered twice or thrice to go away." The profane career of Israel was, however, suddenly arrested. About this time, Puritanism began to show itself in this stronghold of orthodoxy, and more than one student became infected with the heresy. Among these was Israel, who, through the native ardor of his character, suddenly passed from one extreme to the other. He at once adopted the Puritan creed, dress, deportment and every other peculiarity of these extraordinary people, who seemed expressly formed for bearing the bright torch of Christianity, civilization, and liberty, into the wild recesses of a new world. He caused his hair to be cropped, accommodated his dress to the severe simplicity, and his deportment to the staid, sober self-denial of the strict models of the sect, and talked openly of the downfall of anti-Christ's kingdom, the creation of a new heaven and a new earth, new churches, and a new commonwealth together. Expulsion naturally followed such bold defiance of the statutes of the university; and the worthy Pluralist, his father, indignant at this enormous backsliding, on his return home, proffered him the alternative of the thirty-nine articles, or disinheritance. Parental affection and parental authority, kindly exerted, and pursued with perseverance, might, perhaps, have restored Israel to his mother church. But, unhappily, it but too often happens, that in the enforcement of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] what they believe to be the truth, men lose sight of those unchangeable and eternal truths which constitute the basis of our most sacred duties. Men may differ on speculative points, but it is believed that no one in this latter age would think it either Christian or humane to banish a son for differing in opinion with his father. Israel was obstinate, his father inexorable; and thus one of the holiest of all human ties was severed forever. They parted never to meet again, and Israel became a houseless wanderer on the face of the earth. Impelled by zeal---perhaps aided by necessity, he turned field preacher, trusting to the pious gratitude of his followers for food and raiment. He became accustomed in time to rely on the immediate intervention of Providence for the relief of his wants; and finally, in the temerity of his faith, married one of his female disciples, at the moment that he was without a home, and destitute of every hope save that which animated his enthusiastic spirit. That he was a firm believer in the faith he preached, and that all his deeds and doctrines were the result of conviction, cannot be reasonably doubted, for this was demonstrated by the sufferings he endured for their sake. It is not in human nature to sustain what has been so often inflicted for difference of opinion on points of faith, without being braced by that inward conviction which seems to spring from the secret whisperings of the divinity himself, and is the only test of truth to which mankind can directly appeal. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] Hypocrites never become martyrs. This grand tribunal of conscience is, without doubt, sometimes, nay often, perhaps always, subject more or less to the influence of self-love, the great moving principle, which is most directly assailed by persecution. What costs us most, is most dear to us; and that for which we sacrifice all, is everything. The faith of Israel Baneswright had grown up against wind and tide, and the force by which it was assailed only increased its power of resistance. It passed the bounds of zeal, and had grown into a rigid, inflexible bigotry, amounting to uncompromising intolerance. Persecution makes bigots, and bigots make persecution. Though his humanity might have revolted from inflicting on others the sufferings he himself encountered for a difference of opinion, still he shrank with pious abhorrence from the idea of permitting to others that toleration which he demanded for himself and his followers. Stimulated at once, by the ardor of conviction, the hope of being instrumental in the conversion of a sinner, and of adding to his flock one of somewhat higher rank than most of those who as yet composed it, he at once with all that enthusiasm which alone achieves miracles, commenced an attack on the High-Church principles of his fellow prisoner. The design of this tale is not to enter into polemical discussions, which too often end in biting sarcasms or bitter denunciations, equally unbecoming the subject and the occasion. Suffice it to say, that at the end of a long controversy, Harold remained [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] unchanged, and Israel spent his eloquence in vain. As usual in such cases, that feeling of fellowship which arises from community in misfortune, subsided into a coolness approaching dislike. Harold looked on his companion as a bigoted exclusionist, and Israel, on the other hand, considered him one of his persecutors. Yet was Harold not a man who suffered his feelings to be embittered so far as to make him forget the common offices of humanity, which were never more necessary than in behalf of these unhappy conventiclers. The jailer was a dependent on Justice Shorthose, and sought to gain his favor by adding insult to the hardships he daily inflicted; and the petty underlings followed their leader. Like all persons of little and ignoble minds, they were over-zealous in emulating their betters; and it is notorious that of all tyrants there is none so intolerable as the slave. These miserable tools who, after all, give the sharpest sting to that whip of scorpions wielded by persecution, were, or pretended to be, devotedly attached to church and king, under whose broad mantle they sheltered their petty malignity. Harold soon perceived that the anxieties of his companion were less for himself than his wife and daughter, of whose destiny he could learn nothing since their separation. He never failed to inquire of the jailer and turnkeys as opportunity offered, but was answered, for the most part, by bitter taunts, or significant hints of what would happen on the return of his worship the justice, who was absent hunting the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] Crop-ears. He could gain no information, but such as served to increase his solicitude. There was in his bosom a feeling still more powerful than that of enthusiasm. He was devotedly attached to his wife and daughter, who had shared his disgraces and sufferings, and who merited his affection by their tenderness, patience and devotion. He pined for their society, and all his prayers were for them. Nor was Harold without his troubles. On being lodged in prison, he debated within himself whether to apprise his aged father, who was laboring under the weight of years, as well as of a long protracted infirmity which was dragging him by inches down to the grave. The good man had lost his buxom helpmate, years before our history commences. The decayed old trunk had outlived the verdant vine that twined around it, and now stood bare and desolate, nodding to its fall. Though aware that his sudden disappearance would excite the most painful apprehensions, at home, Harold also knew that such was the bigoted devotion of his father to church and state, that he would never forgive his son for attending a conventicle. After long reflection, however, he decided to send to his father, partly to relieve his worst apprehensions, partly in the hope his interference might procure his release. For some days he could procure no messenger, it being contrary to directions of Justice Shorthose for any one to carry a letter or message from a Crop-ear. Nearly a fortnight elapsed, and his anxiety to hear from home had become in the highest degree painful, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] when one day, on repeating his solicitations to be allowed to send a message to his father, the jailer informed him with a grin, the messenger would have a long way to go, for his father on hearing he had become a Crop-ear, had sunk under his afflictions of mind and body, and been laid in his grave, a martyr to the backslidings of his only son. Regardless of the shock which this information occasioned, he proceeded to inform him with a look of peculiar satisfaction, that Master Justice Shorthose, having communicated his apostacy to the proper authorities, a heavy fine had been laid on the estate by the High Commission Court, and a pursuivant, under special supervision of his worship, was now in possession of the house, till the fine was paid. Such were the consequences resulting from accident, and the indulgence of a mere whim of curiosity. Well may man humble himself in the dust when he every day sees himself the sport of trifles in themselves less than nothing. Harold Habingdon, though abstractedly a stern devotee of passive obedience and non-resistance, was one of those men that cannot be crushed, and never fall of themselves. Whatever might be his feelings, he gave them no utterance; and when Israel attempted to console him, he could scarcely perceive that he required consolation. He remained unruffled as before. But his outward seeming belied the spirit within. He felt the death of his father, which left him, as it were, alone in the wilderness of mankind; and the wrongs inflicted on himself became more galling, from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] reflection that they had shortened the days of his only parent. It was now, for the first time in his life, that he began to question in his inmost mind, the truth of that creed which sanctioned such injustice, as well as the legitimacy of the authority by which it was inflicted. He had previously met with some of those famous declarations of Parliament which so ably asserted the rights of the people; and though they came directly in conflict with the principles he had imbibed from his earliest youth, still they had imperceptibly undermined his prejudices without his being as yet conscious of their operation. But having never heretofore suffered from the practical consequences of these arbitrary principles, their intrinsic deformity was not brought home to him, and he had continued to bow implicitly to the slavish doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance. Now, however, he began to feel the galling of the chain, and what his reason had refused to sanction, was realized by actual suffering. Previous to his capture and imprisonment, he would have shrunk from the idea of any limitation to the authority of the king, but that of his own will, and promptly taken arms in its defence, if necessary. But now all the long cherished series of hereditary impressions descending from generation to generation, gathering new strength by the way, and centering in his person, together with the precepts as well as example of his father, and all those with whom he associated, were gradually swept away. The conviction was at length brought home to his door by sad [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] experience, that as man is a being of imperfect virtue and wayward will, that will should be circumscribed by impassible barriers. He had not as yet become quite a Republican; but the course of his reasoning as well as feelings, was calculated to lead to that result in the end. His High-Church principles, too, were sensibly shaken by the same personal experience of the consequences arising from their practical application; since he could not but perceive that the hardships they inflicted on himself and others, were the joint issue of a domineering church, and a despotic king, mutually aiding each other in oppressing the people. He became at length aware of what all history demonstrates, that the worst species of tyranny is that which arrogates to itself the sanction of Holy Writ, and seeks to sway the reason of mankind by the infliction of corporeal suffering, or the withholding of civil rights. Of all despotisms that of ecclesiastical bigotry supported by civil and military power, is the most rigid and unrelenting. While this mental metamorphosis was imperceptibly going on, events bearing closely on the future destinies of Harold had taken place. Master Justice Shorthose had during this period been looking through a perspective at the end of which stood tho old manor house of Habingdon. The powers of this class of officers had been greatly extended for the purpose of more effectually executing the severe laws against the Puritans, and they had become for the most part the petty [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] despots of the fireside, entering houses, seizing persons, and inflicting punishments on the lower orders with as little regard to their rights, as the Star Chamber and High Commission Courts paid to those of a more dignified class. The Justice had already attracted the favorable notice of these renowned tribunals by his zeal and activity, and received some of the crumbs that fell from the great men's table. Thus his fervor was quickened by the hope of gain, as well as power, the love of which is, perhaps, more insatiable in the petty official than the higher functionary. From the period of the infliction of the heavy fine on Harold, Justice Shorthose had thought he perceived a fair prospect of obtaining possession of Habingdon, and in order to pave the way to the gratification of his wishes, now changed his deportment entirely towards his prisoner. He took frequent occasion to express his deep regret at having so precipitately seized and conveyed him to prison, and at the failure of all his efforts to procure his release. He insinuated the inflexible rigor of the higher powers towards persons of his degree when in a similar predicament, and the absolute necessity of paying his fine as a preliminary to his release from prison. He offered from pure regard to the memory of his deceased father, for whom he had always cherished the sincerest regard, to advance the necessary sum, in case Harold found it difficult to raise it, on the spur of the occasion; and finally, with the appearance of great candor, advised him not to make [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] himself more obnoxious to those who had the power as well as the will to crush him to the earth, should he prove refractory. With a view to soften the cool rigidity of Harold towards him, he was somewhat offensively officious in pressing upon the young man various little indulgences; and perceiving the strong interest he now began to take in the misfortunes of Israel Baneswright and his family, permitted his wife and daughter to pass the day in the room allotted to himself and the preacher. This arrangement of course brought Harold into the society of Mistress Baneswright and her daughter; and as usual, similarity of situation, aided by community in misfortune, produced a more than ordinary cordiality. Harold had never before paid any special attention to the appearance of the latter, and was not now particularly struck with her appearance. Her face had little remarkable in its features, and her figure, clothed in garments neither fashionable or costly, presented in its sober simplicity an outline that though not ungraceful, was without any special attraction. Her complexion was very pale, and its expression sad and touching. It was impossible to look at her, without an inward conviction that she had been inured to suffering. Her eyes were black, and though glazed with sorrow, still at times lightened up with sparkling flashes; and her hair, though disposed after the ungraceful manner of her sect, was glossy as well as exuberant. Perhaps the most touching of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] attributes was a voice of mournful melancholy, sweet as the sighing breeze; and when, after a few days' association she spoke to Harold of the long series of hardships her family had endured, it was with a sad, touching pathos, exquisitely affecting. She was pious, but never declaimed; devout without ostentation; and resigned without insensibility. For the first few days, she spoke but little, and that little addressed to her parents. But soon perceiving the deep interest Harold took in their misfortunes, and at the same time sympathising with his own, they gradually fell into an easy intercourse, like that of brother and sister. They usually conversed on the subject of their situation, which naturally led to a communion of feeling, as their fortunes seemed to have thus become strangely associated. In the course of these conversations, Susan Baneswright perceived with a sigh which she believed, and perhaps she was right, originated entirely in spiritual considerations, that Harold, though imprisoned as an accomplice, was not one of her faith. Accordingly, by a tacit understanding, they mutually avoided the rock on which so many good feelings have been wrecked, and refrained from all attempts to convert each other. But with one whose zeal, like that of Israel Baneswright, had been quickened instead of quelled by persecution, it was next to impossible to be thus domesticated day by day, without occasional allusions to the cause of his sufferings. Without directly addressing himself to Harold, he would speak of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] persecutions himself and family had suffered, for following the dictates of their conscience, and guiding others into the path of righteousness. In the course of his conversations he would sometimes enter into details of miserable petty oppression, and wanton outrages inflicted under color of law, that awakened all the sympathies of his heart in behalf of these helpless women, and excited the deepest indignation against those who, under pretence of vindicating the gospel of peace, outraged every principle of Christian benevolence. By frequently listening to these revolting relations, and at the same time associating with these victims of ecelesiastical tyranny, his previous impressions became greatly strengthened, and he at length arrived at the conclusion that a persecuting church was an instrument of man, not of his Maker. As the time passed away, Harold began to find it gradually becoming less irksome and oppressive. He no longer pined for his lonely home, for he had now a gentle, pleasing companion by day, and a subject for nightly contemplation, when, as often happened, his memory would recall the placid yet affecting countenance of Susan, earnestly gazing on him with a look of saintly sorrow, as if lamenting that though joined together by accident and misfortune, they were separated by their creeds. His latter days had been so lonely and contemplative, and his thoughts so full of abstractions, that hitherto those affections that form a part of the very nature of man, had only been awakened in imagination. It is scarcely to be wondered at, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] if being thus daily associated with a young woman, who although not beautiful, was by nature fair, as well as attractive, and whose situation called forth his deepest sympathy; who by her sufferings had excited his pity, and by her patient endurance called forth his admiration---he should gradually be awakened to a feeling more profound and lasting. He at last became conscious of his situation, and would probably have disclosed himself to Susan, but that being confined to the same small apartment, and perpetually in the presence of her parents, he could do nothing more than resort to that universal language which seems equally understood by all civilized, as well as savage beings--- by childhood, youth, and old age. Meanwhile, Justice Shorthose had been sedulously at work to induce Harold to permit him to advance the money to pay his fine, on the security of a mortgage on the estate of Habingdon. But he found the young man every day becoming apparently more indifferent about the affair, and on one occasion being more earnestly pressed for a decision, Harold declared with bitter solemnity, that he would rather rot in jail than voluntarily submit to such illegal exactions, by doing which he should virtually acknowledge their justice. Master Shorthose who had only remitted his zeal for a purpose he now perceived was unattainable, hereupon resolved to bring matters to extremity. According he caused Harold and the Baneswrights to be brought before him for judgment, trial being out of the question, as he judiciously observed, he himself [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] having witnessed their delinquency. This is called Lynch Law. It was a scene at which humanity might weep, and justice shut her eyes, had she not already been blind. Harold and Israel stood stiff and lofty, while the wife and daughter, with folded arms and downcast eyes, awaited the result with pious resignation. The Justice sat in all the stateliness of awkward dignity, surrounded by his subordinate officers, grinning in mockery, and having directed his clerk to read the law against conventicles, gravely observed that being himself a witness to the offence no other proof was required. Here he was interrupted by Israel, who declared no proof was necessary, as he acknowledged, nay, gloried in his vocation, which he was fully assured were imposed upon him by Divine ordination. "Silence!" cried the Justice---"I must at least go through the forms prescribed by statute, and sanctioned by His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is not only Primate of England, but Primate of all England. I don't want your confession unless accompanied by atonement and amendment. 'Slife, Master Crop-ear, do you mean to insult the King's representative, by pretending to confess what he saw with his own eyes? Do you mean to insinuate that I am blind and deaf too, that I did not see and hear you? Your confession is an additional offence, and shall be remembered in your punishment. But to the point. Here, clerk, give me the book. So, now, most reverend apostle, you say you are a preacher of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] gospel. Will you promise to read this to your congregation--- that is to say if you have any next Sunday, if I let you go?" Israel took the volume, opened it, and finding it to be "The Book of Sports," as it was called, so obnoxious to the rigid Puritans, hurled it from him with indignation, at the same time exclaiming--- "Read it---read that accursed work of abominations--- the book of Satan, which converts the holy Sabbath into a holiday for sinners! I'd rather read one of those profane stage plays, some of which, and these among the most abominable, are written by men who call themselves ministers of the gospel. Let it be read at Bartholomew Fair, for verily I will not pollute my lips with such scum of iniquity." "Silence!" again roared the Justice, "or, though it be not in the statute, I will, by virtue of that discretion which appertains to me as being the representative of both church and king, order that foul tongue of yours to be cut off, that it may utter no more blasphemy. Silence, I say, and listen to your sentence, as becomes a contumacious sinner." "I will not be silent," answered Israel, "it is my calling to speak, and I will speak while I have breath to declare the word of truth, and protest against the devices of the ungodly. Lift not your beseeching eyes to me, my poor shorn lambs," said he, glancing at his wife and daughter, "for I am called to fight the good fight, and have girded my loins for the combat. Be not afraid; a little while longer we may be hunted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] like wild beasts of prey; a little while longer we may be insulted, buffetted, striped, imprisoned, and exposed to worldly shame. But hold up your heads, my darlings, and look to Heaven for that justice which yet for a time, a very brief time, I trust, is banished from this land which boasts of its freedom, while it seeks to enslave the mind. He who is justice itself will not forever permit injustice to triumph, for that would carry with it the utter degradation of His creatures. "Yea," cried he, as his feelings gradually waxed into enthusiasm---"Yea, verily the time is coming; it is close at hand; it is already come. England is about to smoke with blood---the blood not of bulls, and goats, and sheep, but of men. For every wrong shall be a victim; for every pang inflicted on the flock of the Shepherd, He shall smite the aggressor with fire and sword. For every drop of blood that hath been drawn by stripes and mutilations, rivers shall flow over the devoted land. For every earthly good we must pay the purchase. But when the welfare of the immortal soul is at stake---when not alone the salvation of the present, but of countless generations yet to come, is in imminent jeopardy; when our greatest good---that which is as high above all sublunary blessings as heaven is above earth---is to be attained, the price, like the benefit, is inestimable. Their must be martyrs to seal with their blood the sincerity of their faith. Every sacred drop that flows from their veins into the ground, nourishes some goodly seed of piety into a stately tree that casts its shadow afar. Blood [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] is the great libation of man, the seal of his bond of faith. "In times like these one martyr will not suffice. When nations sin, nations must atone. There must be hecatombs, thousands, yea tens of thousands of victims, not as heretofore wasting on the burning pile, or quivering on the rack, but offering up their lives on the field of battle where alone the great contest is to be decided, and crimes of rulers expiated by the blood of their people. As for me, I am but a worm, and they may tread on me if they will. If I am not worthy of martyrdom, stripes may suffice. I am ready, Master Justice. Be quick. The past has been yours, the future is in stronger hands than those of the archbishop and the king." This was poured forth with a vehemence and rapidity, that for the time not only silenced the Justice, but caused him to quail before the despised Crop-ear. He soon, however, rallied his dignity, and as is natural to little and malignant minds, revenged himself for his temporary awe by exercising that discretionary power the law allowed him, in the infliction of a severer punishment on the person who had subjected him to the mortification of being cowed by a Crop-ear, in the presence of his officials. "What!"---he at length exclaimed---"you are a prophet as well as a priest? 'Slife, I suppose you will set up for a king soon. Can your reverence, in the spirit of prophecy, predict what is going to happen to yourself, as you have what is going to befall the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] nation? Constable, take him to the Great Hall of the Prison; give him thirty-nine lashes well laid on; slit his nose, as his ears are non est; and then let him depart in peace on his mission of grace." It may be as well to remark here, in explanation of the choice of the prison hall, instead of the market place, or some equally public situation, for the punishment of Israel Baneswright, that of late the Justice had been greeted with very significant tokens of public dissatisfaction, on occasions of similar exhibitions of Christian benevolence. Or, perhaps, he might have become a convert to the opinion that appeals to the imagination are much more effectual than to the senses, and private executions far more effectual in preventing crimes than public examples. "But what shall I do with the women, your worship?" asked the constable, grinning. "O! I had forgot the flock in providing for the shepherd. Let me see---hem---aye---yes---they shall have the pleasure of looking on while the ceremony is performing, and be punished by sympathy. Justice should be tempered with mercy. As for you, Master Harold, you will remain in jail till your fine is paid, or the prophecy of the inspired preacher fulfilled. Away with them." The wife and daughter of the unfortunate field preacher remained throughout the whole of this wicked mockery of justice in the dead silence of resignation, or despair. They had undergone a long series of suffering; and if providence does not always temper [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] the wind to the shorn lamb, it often makes amends by tempering the shorn lamb to the winds. They neither wept, nor wrung their hands, nor cried aloud, though their hearts were bleeding, and their limbs scarcely able to support them. Yet amid all their sufferings, and they suffered much, it was apparent that there was within some potent influence which sustained them in the hour of sore trial. Pale as the ghostly shadow conjured up by fear or superstition; helpless as the dove in the claws of the hawk, they awaited the execution of the sentence. Harold was almost maddened by mingled love and indignation; but the conviction that his interference would only serve to provoke the Justice to new inflictions of petty malice, choked him into silence. He looked on while the preparations were making, with a terrible serenity, ever and anon casting a glance at Susan Baneswright, which, even at this sad extremity, sunk into her heart, and was long afterwards remembered. Israel awaited the infliction of the sentence with manly resignation; casting his eyes towards heaven, and clasping his hands together, he exclaimed: "Lord, Lord! how long wilt thou suffer this?" The preparations were made; the scarred shoulders of Israel exposed; the executioner brandished his cato'-nine tails, and eagerly awaited the order to begin, while the two desolate females placed their hands before their eyes, that they might not behold what they were thus compelled to witness. At this moment a confused hum of many voices, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] followed by loud shouts mingled with angry threats, and equally angry expostulations, was heard without the prison. Anon, the sound of heavy blows, and the tugging of men engaged in hot contention, succeeded this war of words. In a few minutes the outer door was assailed with thundering violence, and finally yielding, gave entrance to a band of rustics armed with iron crows, scythes, stakes, flails, bill-hooks, and other rural weapons. Justice Shorthose was at first struck dumb at this unceremonious intrusion; but soon recovering his self-importance, demanded in a tone of authority mitigated by a slight fit of trembling, what they wanted, and how they dared approach his presence accoutred in this manner. A stern-looking man, bearing an appearance of plain respectability, thus answered--- "We are come to release these poor harmless prisoners, the victims of laws enacted by bigotry, and enforced by tyrants. It depends on your present conduct whether we are not likewise come to punish the miserable instrument of oppression, though our object is higher game." "'Slife!" answered the Justice, a little relieved from the immediate apprehension of personal violence, "'slife, sir, don't you know you are flying in the face of the law and insulting the dignity of his sacred Majesty, together with his Grace the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, by whose authority these pestilent Crop-ears have been apprehended?" "The king's most sacred Majesty," said the other, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] with a grim smile, "and his Grace of Canterbury, are by this time, I opine, flying from the face of an injured people." "What mean you by that, sirrah? Do you dare to spout treason against the king, in the presence of his representative. I'll commit you, sirrah---you shall be carted, whipped, ridden through the streets on a rail, pilloried at the market place, lose your ears, and be hanged, drawn and quartered into the bargain." A low, menacing murmur, accompanied by a suppressed laugh, was the response to this outbreak of the Justice, who was not a little daunted at the ill success of his harangue, as well as the look of cool defiance with which it was met by the person to whom it was addressed. He valued himself not only for his eloquence, but his singular acuteness in detecting a culprit by his physiognomy, and often boasted he could tell a rogue from sheer instinct. The confession of the face, he maintained, was more conclusive than that of the tongue. On this occasion, however, he was altogether at fault. The intruders, with the exception of their spokesman, were plain country people, with ruddy cheeks, and faces expressive of nothing but honest simplicity. The person who appeared to be the leader of the band paid no further attention to the Justice, but quietly directed his followers to release all the prisoners without exception, as it was impossible to distinguish the innocent from the guilty. Accordingly the keys were demanded of the jailer, who called all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] present to witness that he acted under durance. A detachment being sent on this errand, Justice Shorthose employed the interim in a last effort in behalf of his majesty and the archbishop. "'Slife, Master Crop---I say---that is to say--- what was I saying? I say Master What-d'ye-call'em, do you know what you are about? You are breaking the laws in twenty different places---the law spiritual, the law temporal, the law civil, and the law military. You are violating Magna Charta which saith---hem---I say---what was I saying?" "It matters little what you say," quoth the other, as the party detached for that purpose came in with the prisoners, "we are but of the commonalty, yet were always good, peaceable subjects, who respected the law while it afforded us protection against authority unjustly assumed, and exercised without mercy. The despotism of the law may be as oppressive as that of the will; and had not mankind sometimes resorted to those rights which belong to our nature, and cannot be alienated, the whole world would long since have been inhabited only by slaves." "'Fore heaven, this is a new doctrine," grumbled the Justice, "it sounds very much like treason, sprinkled with a little heresy, I think." "Treason? Know, Master Shorthose, when a whole people rise against oppression there are neither rebels nor traitors." The indignation of the Justice at the bold annunciation of these doctrines overcame his fears. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] denounced the intruders by every epithet of opprobrium he could muster on the spur of the moment, and his catalogue was pretty extensive; summoned the posse comitatus in vain; and adjured his most sacred Majesty to witness his total incapacity to resist these lawless intruders. Little attention was paid to his harangue, and the prisoners, among whom, of course, were Israel and his family, quietly departed under the escort of their deliverers. Harold, too, was offered his liberty, but declined it coldly, not being able thoroughly to overcome his reverence for the law, though smarting under its infliction. As Israel left the hall, he emphatically said to him, "assuredly we shall meet again." His wife bade him a warm, but chastened farewell, but the daughter was silent. A single look passed between Susan and Harold, as they parted, whether ever to meet again depended on the chapter of accidents, in which is contained a large portion of the history of man. A Short Foray into the Domain of History---Harold in great Jeopardy--- Interposition of Providence in the Disguise of Old Gilbert Taverner---Justice Shorthose and his Officials Abscond---A Secret concerning Susan Baneswright---Harold in great Perplexity, from which He is at length Relieved by the Interposition of Dan Cupid--- He Becomes not only a Roundhead, but a Republican, and Abjures Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance for ever. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] It is not our intention to enter into a history of the times, any further than as the course of public events exercised an influence over the fortunes of those who figure in this narrative. If we may be permitted to speak in our own behalf, we would, with all due deference to the public taste, insinuate an opinion, that the jumbling together historical facts and fictitious occurrences in one inextricable tissue, cannot but operate to the great prejudice of truth, by confounding those readers, at least, who are not sufficiently qualified to separate the actual from the imaginary occurrences. And this is still more likely to embarrass the reader, when the author is sufficiently familiar with past events to preserve the semblance of history by avoiding all anachronisms; by selecting for his actors persons who really figured at the time; exhibiting a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] few of their leading characteristics, and being so correct in many particulars that when he deviates into fiction the reader is scarcely aware that he has got on the ice, and is no longer walking on solid ground. It is unhappily too true, that history is, for the most part, but a reflection of the feelings and prejudices of the writer, and therefore cannot be explicitly relied upon as a faithful picture of past times or occurrences. In its earliest stage it is a fable; in its progress a romance---founded on fact; in its maturity it may, perhaps, be relied on as a chronicle of events: but of the real causes, and most especially of the secret motives which actuated the prime agents who gave them life and motion, the world can gather little from history but contradictions leading to doubts which cannot be solved. Still it is proper there should be some standard of belief as to the past, and historical works afford the best we have. It would, therefore, seem it were better that they should not be mixed up and confounded with fiction, or that when the writer is about to give the rein to his fancy, he should candidly apprise the reader, in order that he may be properly prepared. The chaste muse of history should not be dressed up in meretricious ornaments, but come forth in all the simplicity of truth, without spot or blemish. The most mischievous falsehoods are adulterated truths. But we are delaying the courteous and impatient reader, who will doubtless excuse our making a slight inroad upon history, although it be against our conscience. It is a great feather in the cap of an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] author, if, when doing what he thinks wrong, he can prove clearly that he knows better. In order to explain the sudden liberation of Israel Baneswright and his followers, it is necessary to revert to the crisis by which it was brought about. The events are doubtless familiar to all, and therefore a few words will suffice. The despotic pretensions of James the First, though only those to which the English nation had quietly submitted under the reigns of his immediate predecessors, were attempted to be enforced on a people who had undergone great changes in the meantime. The despotism of Henry the Eighth was as complete as that of William the Conqueror. By becoming head of the church he had united the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the state, in the exercise of which he met with no opposition from a succession of the most servile parliaments that ever disgraced England; and by the suppression of religious houses he had obtained a fund for purchasing a venal nobility, which, in the long wars of York and Lancaster, had lost all traces of principle or patriotism. His successor was a child in leading strings, who was followed by a woman, called "Bloody Mary" by her embittered opponents, but who, we suspect, was not half so bad as she has been represented, and whose reign was a struggle between religious factions. Elizabeth courted the people and bullied their representatives. She effected popular measures, but in general her acts were those of an absolute sovereign, and she treated parliament with little more [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] ceremony than her father, Henry the Eighth, who, when that body ventured to hesitate about suppressing the lesser monasteries, sent for the members, and told them "he would have the bill to pass, or take off some of their heads." But the reformation of religion was accompanied, or rather preceded, by a revolution in the human mind, which had been silently, slowly, and surely advancing in knowledge and intelligence. Great revolutions, destined to exert a lasting influence over the condition of mankind, are the invisible agents of Providence, operating unheeded and unsuspected until ripe for execution. When all is prepared, the dead calm which usually precedes the convulsion gives place in an instant to the whirling tempest. The long buried genius of change emerges to light full grown, and the moment of its recognition is that of its triumph. Henry the Eighth was merely the instrument. The Reformation would have eventually conquered without his aid. But the puny mortal who only floats with the current, is often mistaken for the omnipotent arm that directs the stream. Reformations in the church are sure to be preceded, accompanied, or followed, by an extension of the franchises of civil liberty, because they both proceed from the expansion of the human mind to which all creeds must more or less accommodate themselves, if not in substance, at least in outward forms of administration. Hence, when in the reign of James the first the Protestant religion became confirmed in its ascendancy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] in England, those political principles of freedom which always grow up and strengthen in the struggle. between contending parties, began to exhibit their sensible operation. The despotic claims of James were discussed, questioned, and at length opposed; those of his successor resisted by Parliament, which at length becoming assured by repeated examples, that no faith could be placed in the concessions of the king, and that the only possible mode of retaining those rights he had only conceded through necessity or fear was to divest him of the means of reclaiming them, determined to resort to the last appeal if necessary. The question whether the command of the Militia should be at the disposal of the Parliament or the King brought matters to the issue. Neither dared to yield; for the command of the militia in the absence of a great standing army which has since superceded it in England, would in all probability finally decide the contest. The only alternative was acquiescence or war. The King erected his standard at Nottingham, and Parliament passed an ordinance for raising an army, accompanied by a vote of supply. England was in arms against herself. The elements of civil and religious dissention were in utter confusion. Arms superseded laws, and the civil authorities could no longer preserve the peace of communities. This was most especially the case in the remote districts which were the scene of events just related, where dissenters abounded; and no sooner did the news arrive that civil strife had actually commenced, than a party of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] those who had frequently attended the exhortations of Israel Baneswright, gathered together, proceeded to the jail, and released him, as set forth in the preceding chapter. Thus it is that extremes beget each other, and that the abuse of authority is the parent of anarchy. Having thus briefly, we hope, prepared the way for what has passed, and what is to come, we shall resume the thread of our story. After the departure of the Crop-ear and his followers, Justice Shorthose solaced his rage and mortification, by divers insulting hints and innuendoes directed against Harold, now the residuary legatee of his wrath, and who he was pleased to consider a party in the outrage against his most sacred Majesty in the person of his doughty representative. As yet ignorant of the commencement of hostilities---for news did not then travel by telegraph---he resolved to make Harold the scape-goat for all the rest, and ordering him to be safely locked in his old quarters, left the prison full of sound and fury. Harold passed the remainder of that day and the ensuing night without food, except for the mind, and that was somewhat bitter. Accustomed to the daily society of Israel and his family, his present loneliness lay heavily on his spirits; and his probable eternal separation from Susan added greatly to its weight. He anticipated new acts of oppression from the discomfited Justice, and prepared himself for still greater exertions of fortitude and patience. From the period of the departure of Justice Shorthose, not the sound of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] a human voice, or passing footstep, had he heard. The prison was as silent as the mansions of the dead, and the striking of the great clock in the hall was the only sound that met his ear. He passed a sleepless night, and rose in the morning with a feeling of depression he had never experienced before. The customary hour of breakfast passed without its appearance; the dinner hour came, but no dinner; and he laid himself down at night under an apprehension that made his blood run cold, having tasted neither food nor water throughout the day. In the meantime the dead, dreary silence continued, and he felt like one abandoned by the world. During the lapse of his second weary, wakeful night, he at times fancied he heard the distant shouts of human voices in the town, but they soon died away, and even the barking of the dogs ceased, as the black clouds encircled the moon and hid its silvery light. The next day, and the next, passed in the same manner, with the same dead silence, and the same abstinence. He now began to experience the usual effects of protracted hunger and thirst. When he attempted to walk his limbs faltered, his head grew dizzy, his sight vague, and objects indistinct. By degrees his brain waxed weak and visionary, for lack of that which is equally necessary to body and mind. A crowd of indistinct images arose, which, though they prevented his dwelling intensely on the reality of his situation, aggravated his sufferings by the addition of imaginary auxiliaries. His repose was nothing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] but half-waking, half-sleeping dreams, of chrystal springs and plenteous feasts, so that he might be said only to awake to the tortures of Tantalus. While his strength enabled him, he watched constantly at the only window of his room, which looked into the interior, where was a small yard, enclosed with a high, massive wall, beyond which lay the open fields. But not a soul was stirring there. Sometimes he knocked at the door with all his strength, and called for aid. But no one heard, and no one answered. He seemed destined to perish by famine, alone in the midst of his fellow creatures. Every day added to his weakness, and at the same time his restlessness; for though ordinary hunger seeks oblivion in sleep, there comes a time when the starving wretch is deprived of that solace; when the brain becomes affected, and the powers of nature being exhausted, death, not sleep, is the only refuge. On the morning of the sixth day, after a sleepless night, during a great part of which all consciousness of present suffering was lost in the medley of horrors that floated in the chaos of his unsettled brain, as he lay on his miserable pallet in that state of almost unconsciousness which happily accompanies a mind and body exhausted by extreme suffering, he was recalled to a sense of his situation, by fancying he heard the footsteps of some person along the narrow passage outside of his door. The instinct of nature, rather than any distinct perception of his position, roused Harold to a last effort. He called out in a feeble [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] voice, and essayed to rise from his bed; but no answer was returned, and the footsteps died away in the distance. Again he relapsed into his former state, and sank down on the bed from which he had partly risen. After an interval of a few minutes, he distinguished the sound of returning footsteps, and, as he imagined, the jingling of keys. Hope now re-animated his waning strength, and he had managed to raise himself so as to lean against the wall, when he heard the turning of a key and the grating of hinges, as the door opened. He was too weak for joy; but the sudden revulsion of his feelings overpowered him; a film came over his eyes, and he sank down in a state of almost complete insensibility. He fancied he heard some one calling him by name in a voice hallowed by long past remembrances, and though he strove to answer, his words died away in inarticulate murmurs. By degrees the film passed away from before his eyes, and he thought he perceived a figure bending over him, whose face seemed familiar. The process of returning recollection was very slow; for nature was almost exhausted, and hung to life by a single hair. But the voice of one lamenting over his sad condition, that voice of kindness and sympathy which can almost call us back from the grave, was at length recognized as that of a grey-headed domestic, whose life, together with that of a long line of forefathers, had been passed under the roof of Habingdon. Harold addressed him in a feeble whisper, and the old man, comprehending his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] situation, procured refreshments, which were cautiously administered, until in due time he was conveyed to his home. Many days elapsed before Harold recovered sufficiently to leave his bed, and totter to the window, there to inhale the sweet morning air, and enjoy the beauties of what almost seemed a new world spread out before him. Every object appeared invested with a new and inexpressible charm, and the music of the birds was as the voice of long lost friends welcoming him home again. In the course of his convalescence he learned the mystery of his unaccountable desertion in prison, which at times he had ascribed to the malice of Justice Shorthose. But with all his manifold offences the Justice was innocent of any intention of starving his prisoner. He did not scruple at inflicting stripes, and his conscience would go to the length of slitting noses, or cutting off ears; but to do him justice starvation was beyond the sphere of his depravity, which, in fact, proceeded less from nature than the union of sectarian zeal with a vehement desire to make himself agreeable to the higher powers that set him the example. The truth is, that on quitting the prison, after the forcible abduction of his prisoners, he had been so hooted and pelted by the townsmen, who had many old scores to settle with him, and were withal incited to violence by the example of King and Parliament, that he was fain to seek shelter in the house of a relative, whence he made his escape in the middle of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] night. To make an end of this important personage, who will appear no more in our history, we will shortly state for the gratification of the curious reader, that he remained the most loyal of subjects until after the battle of Naseby, when he turned Round-head, cropped his hair, prayed, not in secret, and exhorted vociferously. Thus he continued till the restoration, when, happily shielded by his insignificance from the consequences of his backslidings, he came in with the full tide of loyalty, and was rewarded by his grateful sovereign after the manner of that merry monarch. The Justice having absconded, the jailor, and other officials who had become equally distasteful to the townsmen, followed his example, and departed without taking leave. Thus the prison was left solely to the occupancy of Harold, who remained unnoticed, either because no one suspected his being there, or that he was completely forgotten in the ferment of that civil commotion which might now be said to monopolize every thought and feeling. That he did not actually perish from hunger, was owing to a mere accident, or as Israel Baneswright always affirmed, a special interposition of Providence. However this may be, thus it was. The old house of Habingdon on being taken possession of by the pursuivant, was cleared of all the servants except one Gilbert Taverner, the old household factotum, who was permitted to remain partly for the purpose of being useful, partly to save appearances. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] The others found a home or employment elsewhere, and did not trouble themselves about the affairs of Harold. As to old Gilbert, he shrank with the natural timidity of servitude from meddling with what did not come within the sphere of his household duties, and most especially from all intercourse with Master Justice Shorthose, who was as much the terror of good, as evil doers. He was a perfect man machine, and had been for at least half a century moving exactly in the same circle, doing the same things, at the same hour, and in the same order of succession, without thinking of any other earthly matter. He revolved like a planet within the inflexible sphere of attraction, and it is said never forgot to strap his master's razor but once in his youth, when he was sorely smitten with the milkmaid. Gilbert was totally ignorant of the abdication of the Justice, the town being six miles from Habingdon, a distance he never travelled even in imagination. Thus matters stood while Harold was suffering the most painful infliction to which man perhaps can be doomed, when a stranger made his appearance in the town, inquiring for Master Harold Habingdon, and proceeded towards the residence of that young man, according to the directions given. The first person he met on arriving there was Gilbert, to whom he presented a letter from Israel Baneswright, for his master. Gilbert referred him to the prison, but was answered by the messenger, that the prison was empty, and the Justice as well as his officials run [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] away. The old man was somewhat startled from his orbit at this information, and it was sometime before he could comprehend the exigencies of this new predicament. At length rallying his dormant faculties, he bethought himself of consulting the messenger who sagely advised him to proceed forthwith to town and inquire what had become of the young gentleman. By this time Gilbert had so far recovered himself, as to detect in the costume, close cropt hair, and nasal twang, a veritable Roundhead in the person of his visitor. As a faithful servant, he felt himself bound to follow in the footsteps of his deceased master, and was accordingly a devoted disciple of the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance. He waxed exceedingly wroth and bitter on thus recognizing one of the king's enemies; absolutely refused to receive the letter, marched into the house, and slammed the door in the face of the messenger, who could just distinguish the word Crop-ear, uttered with bitter emphasis. Hereupon he threw the letter into an open window, and departed, chanting a godly hymn in stout defiance. When Gilbert Taverner became cool again, his mind reverted to young Master Harold who had succeeded his father in the affections of the old man. He straightway entered into a deep and rather confused cogitation concerning the course proper to be pursued on this occasion, the result of which, though it went greatly against the grain, was a determination to follow the advice of the Crop-ear, and proceed to the town for the purpose of ascertaining the fate of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] Harold. But still he shrunk from this daring exploit, and ever and anon relapsed into doubt or despair. "I am a perfect stranger in these remote parts," thought he, "and who will clean the knives, or set the table, while I am away at such a distance?"---for be it known that Gilbert, though his old master was dead, and his young master no one knew where, continued to go through the regular course of his duties, from the mere force of habit. Thus he remained as it were at a stand amid conflicting eddies. He whistled, and fidgetted about in great perplexity what course to pursue; but at length habit got the better of all competitors, and he insensibly found himself occupied as usual in the daily routine of household duties. Having gone through these with satisfaction to himself, he was at leisure to attend to the affairs of his young master, and after a deal of hesitation accompanied by abundance of wry faces, at length resolved to adopt the suggestion of the Crop-eared messenger. Accordingly, having secured the silver spoons---a family heirloom---locked the door, and put the key in his pocket, he procceded to town for the purpose of ascertaining the fate of Harold. The result of his mission has already been detailed. The letter from Israel Baneswright was filled with fervent exhortations to join heart and hand in maintaining civil and religious liberty, which were now to stand or fall together. It was written with all that fiery eloquence of enthusiasm which, when excited in a righteous cause is irresistible, and when in that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] of error, potent for mischief. But not a word was said about his wife and daughter, nor did the date of the letter give any indication of the place of his sojourning. The mind of Harold had, during his convalescence, dwelt intently on his present situation and future prospects. The uprising of the people in the neighborhood had frightened away the pursuivant who held possession of Habingdon, and the death of his father had left him master of himself as well as his property. He was, on one hand, swayed by the powerful influence of hereditary feelings or prejudices, call them what you will, as well as by the habits of his life, the bias of education, and the force of example; on the other by having not only seen, but suffered under the abuse of power in his own person; doubts, almost amounting to conviction of the legitimacy of that authority which could be perverted to the purposes of oppression; and what was perhaps still more influential in turning the scale, a quiet, deep-rooted affection for Susan Baneswright, his fellow sufferer under oppression. But Harold possessed a weighty and capacious mind; a temper though warm and energetic, qualified by the power of restraint and conviction. He was accustomed to deliberate long and coolly on subjects of great concern; and it was only when thoroughly convinced, that he acted with a prompt enthusiasm little suspected of forming the basis of his character. He drew the bow and took aim deliberately, but the arrow once sped, could never be recalled. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] While still in doubt as to his future course, he was surprised by a visit from Israel Baneswright, who seemed to have been wrought up to a state of excitement amounting to wild fanaticism. He scarcely allowed time for the usual salutations, when he entered on the only subject that occupied his heart. "Why art thou here, O man of little patriotism, and still less faith? Is this a time for a son of England to skulk within the walls of his father's house, while others are abroad in the field, shedding their blood in defence of those rights of which if secured he will equally partake, and which if lost must render him an abject slave to the will of a fellow worm? Is this a time to stand an idle spectator, while the great question is about being decided, whether or not the mind and body shall be equally crushed under the heel of power, and the reason of man be no longer applied to the concerns of either earth or Heaven? "Sluggard, why standest thou here all the day idle? Dost thou not know that thy mother is struggling in the arms of the ravisher, and calling on her children to rescue her? All is at stake and thou art doing nothing. Awake! arise!---Gird on the sword; or if thou canst not wield a sword, go forth like David with a sling and a stone---or go forth with thy naked arm, for the Great Jehovah is on thy side, and the courageous, determined spirit is more potent than the sharp-edged steel, in the hands of the Philistines." To this fiery exhortation Harold calmly replied, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] "My friend, I have been long considering the subject, and--- "Considering!" cried Israel impatiently---"Is this a time for consideration, when a single battle, yea, a single arm may decide the future fate of thee and thine, and of every man that breathes in this oppressed land---of millions living and countless millions yet unborn? Dost thou stand here selfishly weighing thy petty interests, and personal ease, against the freedom and happiness, the bodies and souls of long generations yet to come? Dost thou not know that the Bill of Rights, the great charter, not of the nobles but the people, hath already been sealed with blood---that the blood of the righteous as well as that of the wicked must flow in torrents ere it can wash away the sins of the people and their rulers? A despotic king and a persecuting church are now engaged in a desperate struggle with an oppressed people; and when force is resorted unto to bring about the ends of Providence, force must decide the contest. Courage and patriotism on the part of mortals is necessary to prove them worthy the assistance of an almighty arm; for be assured that miracles were never yet wrought in behalf of those who were too base and degraded to help themselves. Cowards can never be free, and man must be inspired with the contempt of death, ere he can hope to wrest the prize of liberty from the grasp of the tyrant. Why art thou not in the stirrup and the field?" "Listen to me calmly, I beseech thee Master [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] Baneswright," replied Harold not unmoved, "on occasions when we are about taking a decisive step---to risk all---nothing should be decided rashly. I was going to tell you that I have for some time been debating with myself as to the course I should take--- whether to remain neutral---" "Neutral!"---again interrupted Israel---"Neutral! Dost thou, a worm of the dust, expect to look on in peace while all around thee is in convulsions? Dost thou hope to crawl into the ground, and there remain quiet while the world is rocking with earthquakes? The whirlpool is all about thee, and dost thou think to float round and round in endless circles, without being at length drawn into the vortex? Believe it not---hope it not. Thou must take sides, or be buffetted by both sides; and if neither conscience nor patriotism, neither reverence for thy Maker, nor love to thy fellow man can sway thy leaden purposes, look to thyself, since self is thine only monitor, and be assured that so long as this strife shall last, if thou dost not declare for either Parliament or King, thou wilt fare like the bat in the fable, and be despised and disclaimed by both parties." "I was about to tell you," said Harold, "that I had made up my mind not to remain neutral. "Well," cried the other impatiently. "That I had all but determined to take up arms in behalf of the Parliament. But---" "Hear me," cried Israel, who could no longer rein in the fiery steed on which he was mounted. "Hear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] me, young man, let me ask you one question, and be thy answer without disguise. Dost thou not love my daughter Susan?" "I do," said Harold eagerly, "with all my soul, though I have never told her so." "Not with thy lips, perhaps; but there is another language equally explicit. Suffice it that I noticed the glances that passed between thee and my daughter in prison, and more especially at parting. As a parent it became me to question her on the subject, and as a dutiful daughter, whose heart hath been always open to her father, she acknowledged that couldest thou be persuaded to walk in the way of righteousness, if it pleased Heaven, she would willingly live and die thy helpmate---nay, interrupt me not---but hear what I say, Harold Habingdon. If thou provest craven to the just and holy cause now at issue in the land; and above all, if thou shouldest seek fellowship with its enemies, in the sight of Heaven I solemnly declare, thou shalt never see my daughter more. No son of Belial shall be a son of mine. Farewell---I shall know of thy decision. If right, thou shalt hear from me, and peradventure we may smite the Philistines together. If wrong, we never meet again except in mortal fight, for if necessary I too will become a man of blood, in so far that I will strengthen men of blood with my exhortations. Saying this, Israel suddenly departed without awaiting any reply, leaving Harold agitated by a whirlwind of conflicting feelings. But this did not last long, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] the tempest soon subsided into the calm of determination. He resolved to join the Parliamentary forces, as soon as the necessary preparations could be made. Though his reason in a great measure coincided with this decision, it cannot be denied that it was Susan Baneswright, and not the exhortations of her father, that decided the course of his future life. The confession of that gentle girl from this time guided his sword, and animated his spirit through all the sad vicissitudes of civil strife. The die was at length thrown by love, who, casting himself into the wavering scale, outweighed all other considerations, and the cause of loyalty kicked the beam. Hitherto he had been only the cotemporary of past ages; henceforward he became associated with the present and the future. Harold Joins the Parliamentary Forces---the Fortunes of War---He Makes Acquaintance with a Man of whom there is but One Opinion, and of Another of whom there are Many---Scene on the Field of Battle, and Exit of Israel Baneswright---Change from the Field of Blood to the Fields of Rural Life---Coelebs in Search of a Wife--- Finds by Chance what He Missed in Seeking. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] During the somewhat tedious recovery of Harold, and his subsequent irresolution, both parties had been engaged in active hostilities, unaccompanied by any decisive result. The battle of Edgehill had been fought with doubtful success, and the intervals of action were occupied by negociations in which, it is believed neither party was sincere. Mutual propositions for peace were made and declined under various pretences, and it had become evident to those who looked beneath the surface, that the contest could only be decided by the sword. Accordingly, both parties braced themselves for the final issue. The Earl of Essex was at the head of the Parliamentary forces, and had already excited the jealousy of the leaders of the House of Commons, by his inactivity, as well as want of vigilance. Thus far the result of the struggle seemed extremely doubtful. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] King had been successful in Cornwall, and other parts of the kingdom: misunderstandings subsisted among the Parliamentary generals, who of course did not cordially co-operate: and it was daily becoming more evident, that Essex, as well as several other noblemen who had taken arms against the King, were not exactly on the side of the people. Though ready to oppose the despotic claims of Charles, so far as they interfered with their own exclusive privileges, they were by no means prepared to strip him quite bare of his prerogative; and without doubt, by this time began to perceive, or at least suspect, that if finally successful, the popular leaders would not stop at a redress of grievances. In short, they began to fear for themselves and their order. A people struggling for freedom can never place any just reliance in those who monopolize in a great degree the benefits of the abuse of power; nor should they ever choose them for leaders. The chief of a revolution which has for its object the attainment of equal rights, rather than a mere change of dynasty, should be a child of the revolution, sharing the sympathies, partaking in the grievances of the people, and claiming a legitimate right to command, not from superiority of rank, but of talents, vigor and patriotism. Harold had left home on horseback, placing his domestic affairs in charge of honest Gilbert, who continued to set out the dinner table every day at the same hour, and in the same manner as if his master was present, until at length, perceiving with great [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] surprise, that no one attended, he relinquished the practice in despair. It is said, with what truth we know not, that he afterwards occupied the dinner hour in wandering about the house as if looking for somebody that was missing. The reader may perhaps question the prudence of Harold in leaving his affairs in the hands of old Gilbert. But it was in fact Hobson's choice; he had neither kindred, acquaintance, or friend around him; and in the confusion of the times, perhaps justly concluded that upon the whole he might as well trust to Providence and Gilbert. The journey of Harold was devoid of incident or accident, and he joined the Parliamentary forces, at that time encamped on Turnham Green, under the Earl of Essex. The royal army was close at hand, the King having taken advantage of a negociation for peace then in progress to make a rapid march upon the city of London, in the course of which he surprised two regiments of the hostile troops, which were cut off almost to a man. Being admitted a private in a troop of horse attached to the Train Bands, he at once entered on active service. A battle was hourly expected, and Skippon, the sturdy leader of the Train Bands, composed of London apprentices, in anticipation of this event, took occasion to address them in the following pithy and characteristic words: "Come, my brave boys, let us pray heartily, and fight heartily. I will run the same fortunes and hazards with you. Remember the cause is for God, for the defence of your wives and children. Come my boys, let us pray heartily, and fight heartily." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] Such was the spirit which animated a large portion of the Parliamentary army, and it is not to be wondered at that they ultimately conquered. Religious enthusiasm had been arrayed against the sentiment of loyalty; and devotion to the King was met by the far more powerful influence of devotion to a higher power. The love of liberty was combined with the enthusiasm of religion, and the two united proved irresistible. That a great majority of the Puritans of that age were sincere in their professions, notwithstanding the charge of hypocrisy so often urged against them by the Loyalists, and reiterated by succeeding English historians, we think can scarcely be doubted. Cromwell may have been a hypocrite, though this appears extremely doubtful; but his followers were unquestionably sincere, as they proved on various occasions by freely sacrificing themselves on the field of battle. If any additional proof be required, let us cast our eyes towards the band of Pilgrims, who sacrificed their country, home, kindred, friends, and all those associations of early days that cling closest to the heart of man, to seek the far distant wilds of a new world; to cope with danger, death and famine; to struggle with the wintry winds; to war with the fury of wild beasts and the wiles of savage men; to labor in the fields, and worship in churches with arms in their hands, and meet the trying exigencies of a keen, inhospitable climate, divested of all the common comforts of life. To doubt the sincerity of these were to question the faith [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] of the primitive martyrs, who offered up their lives on the wheel or at the stake, and sped their last breath in songs of triumph. But to resume our narrative. To the disappointment and disgust of his army, Essex, it is said by the advise of some of the noblemen who served under him, strenuously opposed by that of a majority of the others, instead of offering battle to the King while facing him for several hours, suddenly wheeled about, and retreated to London, without being pursued. His subsequent conduct was such as to increase the suspicions already entertained by his partisans, and inspire the enemy with new hopes of final success. Without entering into a detail of the events which succeeded, and in which Harold was not immediately concerned, we shall content ourselves with noticing the skirmish of Chalgrove Field, in which the conduct of Essex was again equivocal and unsatisfactory. An excursion of Prince Rupert from Oxford, the headquarters of the King, had alarmed the neighboring counties, and the Parliamentary forces were eagerly following him, as he retreated laden with booty. Among the foremost on this occasion was the patriot Hampden, who though an officer of foot, joined a body of cavalry of which Harold was one. They overtook the Prince at Chalgrove Field, and in their eagerness, advancing too rapidly, were environed by the enemy and cut to pieces. Almost at the first discharge, Hampden had been shot in the shoulder with a brace of bullets, and one of the prisoners to the Royalists [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] reported that he had seen him early in the action, slowly quitting the field, his head hanging down, and his arms resting on the neck of his horse. Harold, too, had been rather severely wounded, and on leaving the field, it so chanced that in his progress towards the main body of the patriot army, he overtook Hampden, who appeared on the point of dropping from his horse. Though in little better plight, he endeavored to assist him to the utmost of his power; but the strength of both failed them rapidly, and seeing a comfortable-looking farm house at a little distance, somewhat retired from the road, he proposed to attempt to gain it before they became entirely exhausted. Accordingly thither they proceeded, and were kindly received by the master of the house, who was devoted to the same cause, though too aged to take an active part in the struggle. Prince Rupert, who generally lost by impetuosity what he gained by valor, having succeeded in reaching Oxford with his booty, while Essex was looking on, the Parliamentary army remained master of the field. The situation of Hampden and Harold prevented their removal, and the latter found himself companion in suffering with this illustrious patriot, during the brief remaining period of his existence. Though suffering exquisite pain he maintained a perfect abstinence from all complaint, and apparently forgetting himself thought only of his country. Being engaged in the same cause, and fellows in suffering, they occasionally communed with each other on the state of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] public affairs. At these times Harold listened with respectful deference to the voice of wisdom and patriotism proceeding as it were from the grave, for it became every moment more evident that his hours were numbered, and were but few. The day preceding his death, when the weakness of nature had overborne the capacity for suffering, the great patriot of England, after long silence and deep reflection, addressed Harold, as follows: "The die is cast, and my earthly career is over. I could have wished to bear my part in the great contest now at issue, and to have seen the final result, whether successful or not; for I did not ask myself when I took arms against my sovereign but the single question, whether or not our cause was just. It was enough for me that England was oppressed, and that all men have a natural right to resist oppression however sanctioned by precedent, or hallowed by time. Antiquity is no warrant for abuses; on the contrary the longer a nation has suffered them, the greater reason they should be relieved as soon as possible." After pausing a few minutes to recover breath, he proceeded--- "But I am called away, as it were, at the dawn of morning, perhaps in mercy that I may not see the darkness of the night that may succeed. For I will not conceal from you, my young companion in calamity, that my hopes diminish, in proportion as the prospect of a successful issue in the strife of arms increases. I do not fear the people, but their leaders; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] for the people are ever right, except when deceived by those they trust, and always successful, except when betrayed. But there are among us wolves in sheep's clothing, who I suspect will betray the flock to the midnight robber. As might be expected---for such is ever the mixture of liberal and selfish motives, in all the great, as well as little affairs in which man is the instrument---the noblest motives are often mingled with the meanest. Patriotism, which is the highest of earthly influences, is profaned by an association with selfishness, the meanest of them all. "Already I perceive increasing symptoms of alienation among some of our chief leaders, and those, too, whose rank and wealth give them the most extensive influence; struggles among others of meaner rank, for the spoils even before they are won; and a general want of that concert of action, if not of opinion, which from first to last, in all past time, has been the bane of all parties without an acknowledged head, to whom long established laws, and immemorial custom, have prepared men to be obedient. The King is weak, if not unprincipled, and in the hands of still weaker and more wicked councillors. There is no longer any confidence to be placed in his word, which is the only bond of those who claim to be above the law. He will lose his cause, for he knows not how to fight or negociate; to make war or peace. We shall, in all human probability, gain the power to do what I and some others had in view, when forced to seek redress by the sword; but I greatly fear it may be so abused by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] contending factions, attaining a temporary ascendancy, that the people wearied and disgusted by repeated disappointments, and sick of the struggles of leaders, whose incapacity will be only equalled by their ambition, will at length be wrought upon to return like the dog to his vomit, and restore without reservation the same power to the same despot by whom it was abused. "If such should be the case---which Heaven avert! it will speedily be followed ere long by another revolution, the offspring of the first; and England will be again doomed to pay a second price for a blessing she heedlessly threw away. Thus, my young friend, we who shed our blood will not shed it in vain. It will not, like the rivers of the desert, sink into the earth without yielding either flowers or fruits; its product will eventually be the enjoyment of a rational liberty, which could not have been obtained without martyrs. With this conviction I die, and with it I die content, leaving my motives, acts, and opinions, to the judgment of posterity." These sentiments were uttered at intervals, as his exhausted strength permitted, and when finished, the dying patriot sank exhausted on his pillow, where he lay some hours without another word. Thus he quietly passed away, apparently without pain, and without fear. The Royalists exulted in his death, which had rid them of their most formidable enemy; while the opposite party mourned it as the loss of their best friend. Like Washington, he has united the suffrage of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] world in his favor. Posterity has but a single voice in speaking of Hampden, who at one time seemed to concentrate in himself the spirit of the nation, and even the historian of the Revolution, himself a courtier, as well as a loyalist, who seldom ascribes other than sinister, or selfish motives for the conduct of friend or foe, has been compelled to yield to his talents and patriotism the highest meed, that of unwilling praise. The recovery of Harold was slow and gradual; and it was not until the opening of the next campaign that he entered on active service, when he found great changes had taken place in the Parliamentary army. The self-denying ordinance, as it was called, had excluded a class of officers, whose zeal, if not fidelity, had been suspected; but an exception was made in favor of Oliver Cromwell, who was then at the head of the army in fact. He had rapidly risen to distinction, by a series of successful exploits; and it was the fortune of Harold, who had been promoted to the command of a troop of horse, to be frequently brought into contact with one of the most extraordinary men of that or any other age. Observing the quick decision, as well as fearless courage of Harold, on various occasions of great exigency, Oliver attached him to his person before the end of the campaign, during the course of which Harold studied his character intensely, only to become more profoundly puzzled by its apparent inconsistencies. The real character of Cromwell is still a mystery--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] partly from its own deep profundity, partly from the bitter prejudices that are awakened in forming a judgment. Whether a hypocrite, or an enthusiast; a patriot, or a mere creature of selfish ambition, is a question that will probably never be decided. Assuredly, however his sincerity or his patriotism may be questioned, none can doubt his qualifications as a soldier, or his abilities as a statesman; and the most loyal Englishman when he denounces him as a rebel and a traitor, should bear in mind, the successful vigor with which he asserted the honor of England, and caused the most potent monarchs of his time to crouch at his feet. England owes him more than a host of her legitimate monarchs combined can justly claim, and if he accepted the sovereignty he wielded it nobly. Though leader of a band of stern enthusiasts, who in their abhorrence of the "Book of Sports," had perhaps fallen into the opposite extreme of sour austerity; and though he himself set the example in zeal, as well as sobriety, yet were there frequent occasions in which he deviated into downright buffoonery. Though in public he was grave and reserved, in his family, and among his friends, his conversation was familiar and diverting. He indulged in practical jokes; he loved the society of men of wit, and his domestic chaplain, Jeremy White, was a great humorist. A grave old chronicler says, "Oliver Cromwell, the Protector, loved a good voice and instrumental music well; and when Mr. James Quin, a student of C. C. Oxford, a good singer, was introduced to him, he heard him sing with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] great delight, liquored him with sack, and in conclusion said, `Mr. Quin, you have done well, what shall I do for you?' To which, Mr. Quin made answer, with great compliments, (of which he had command with great grace,) `That your Highness would be pleased to restore me to my student's place,' which the Protector did accordingly, and he held it to his dying day." Oliver's jokes were sometimes rather rough, it must be acknowledged. He would occasionally, when he suspected any intrigue was going on in the army, invite his inferior officers to an entertainment, and in the midst of their jolity, order in a company of footguards, with beat of drum, to whisk the dishes away, after the manner of Doctor Pedro Positive de Snatchaway. While this was in progress, Oliver pelted them with cushions, or put live coals into their boots and pockets; and when thus thrown off their guard by this sportful conviviality, would wheedle them out of all such secrets as he desired to know. When it suited his purpose, he spoke in a style so full of studied perplexity, that no one could comprehend his meaning; but when he wished to be understood, he delivered himself with a force and vigor and clearness, that caused it to be said of him that "His every word was a thought." But the real character of kings and rulers, who are succeeded by those of opposite principles, is seldom, if ever, fairly delineated, since historians are either themselves infected with party prejudices, or become the organs of those that are. Thus [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] it has fared with Oliver Cromwell. The loyal English, while they cannot help pluming themselves on the successful vigor of his foreign policy, which laid the foundation of their country's greatness, still consider him a hypocrite and usurper; while the republicans can never forgive him for having picked up a sceptre that lay in his way, and appropriated to himself an authority that had no owner. Under this renowned leader, Harold entered on a career of arduous service, the particulars of which will be passed over, as more properly belonging to history. Advanced to the command of a regiment of horse, at the head of which he greatly distinguished himself at the decisive battle of Naseby, it was once more his fortune to be desperately wounded, near the close of the action. He received a musket ball in the thigh, which caused so great a loss of blood, that in a few minutes he fell from his horse insensible, where he lay unheeded, while his regiment rushed on in hot pursuit of the flying Royalists, leaving the scene of conflict among the living, peopled only by the dying and the dead. Recovering his recollection after a brief interval, and raising himself on his elbow with great difficulty, he looked around with dim and glazed eyes, rendered half blind by weakness and exhaustion. Both armies had passed away, one in retreat, the other in pursuit. Nothing remained but the wounded and dying; nothing was heard but groans of anguish and despair. Some lay stretched on the ground with their pale faces turned to heaven; some writhing in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] agony, and tearing the earth; and here and there might be seen an expiring victim half propped up by a dead body. Enemies and friends now joined in one melancholy concert of moans, and those who from fellow subjects had become mortal foes, now once more rested together in peace in the long armistice of death. Thoughts like these occurred not to him, for his own condition in a great measure occupied his mind, and cooled his sympathy for others. He had managed in a degree to stop the bleeding of his wound by the application of a handkerchief; but a faintness like that of approaching dissolution hung upon him, and as evening was now at hand, he felt assured that if he passed the night on the field, he would never see the dawn of morning. From the consideration of his own forlorn state, he was moved by a feeble voice exclaiming--- "Is there any one here that knows Ambrose Harefleet?" "Yes," answered another voice equally feeble. "Who art thou?" asked the first. "Thy brother, Miles." "The Crop-ear---the traitor to his king---and the curse of his father"---cried the other, his voice strengthening with indignation. "And thou," said Miles Harefleet---"The companion of the sons of Belial, the persecutor of the faithful, and the oppressor of thy fellow subjects. But alas! this is no time to dispute the justice of our cause. The appeal has been made to the sword and there is but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] one higher tribunal. Canst thou not crawl hither, for I cannot come to thee to exchange forgiveness and die together." The one brother managed, with many moans, to crawl to the other, and they fell into each other's arms weeping. "I forgive thee, Miles, for drawing the sword against thy king." "And I forgive thee, Ambrose, for drawing thine against the people. But enough of this bickering. Though we have of late lived in discord, let us die in peace. Let us remember we are brothers; one mother bore, one bosom nourished, one country sustained, and one God will judge us both. To-day we have met in mortal fight, to-night we shall lay down in peace together. Alas! my dear wife and children, and my dear country---what will become of ye all?--- Brother! brother! give me your hand, I am going." The two brothers embraced, and lay for a while locked in each other's arms, without any other evidence of life than occasionally a low moan, bespeaking the agonies of nature in her last struggle. In a short time it ceased, and the silence of death succeeded. This sad example of the deplorable consequences of civil strife, which sets brother against brother, father against son, and severs all the ties of nature and society, sank deep into the heart of Harold, who often recalled it to mind, and as often asked himself whether even liberty was not sometimes too dearly purchased. But such reflections were speedily banished by a sense [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] of his own situation. Night was now close at hand; he could still feel the blood trickling from his wound, and was conscious of increasing weakness. With a last despairing effort he raised himself sufficiently to recline against the body of one whom he supposed dead, but who feeling the pressure of his weight uttered a low moan, at the same time making a feeble effort to escape the burden. Harold turned his head towards him, and at once recognized the pale face of Israel Baneswright, bearing the ghastly expression of approaching death. He addressed him by name, but he answered only by a groan. At length he gradually regained his consciousness, and in a voice that seemed to come from one whose spirit was already on tip-toe for another world, asked who was there. "Your friend Harold Habingdon," answered the other, and the name seemed to awaken the last spark of life. "Thou art come too late to help me," said Israel. "Alas? I am as helpless as yourself." "Art thou too wounded?" "Yes, sorely." "And in what cause? That of a tyrant king, or a suffering people?" "I serve under Oliver Cromwell." "Enough---we will then die together; and I for my part would die rejoicingly, did I but know that the Philistines have been conquered and on the field where I perish." "Thy wish is granted. The Royal army has been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] defeated utterly, and chased from the field. I doubt if it will rally again." The news seemed to awaken Israel to new life and energy. He raised himself partly from the ground, and exclaimed with an enthusiasm that seemed only more energetic from his weakness--- "Praise be to the Lord of Hosts! The malignant adversary is smitten, hip and thigh; the usurping Prelacy are sinking under the weight of a persecuted people; the kingdom of anti-Christ is falling, and those who have been crushed under its foot shall crush it under their foot in turn. The great armies of Gog and Magog are fleeing before the might of the godly. Let us pray with Joshua, that the sun may stand still in Gideon, and the moon in the valley of Aijalon, that there be time to smite the Philistines, even without mercy, as they have dealt towards the children of righteousness." Exhausted by the effort, he sank again to the ground and spoke no more. Harold eagerly inquired after Susan; but he answered not. His spirit had departed, and the last breath of one whose temper was originally mild and forgiving, was expended in maledictions on his fellow creatures. Such are the effects of religious persecution, equally the offspring and the parent of bigotry. By this time straggling parties of the victorious army were beginning to return; and commencing their first duty to their wounded fellow-soldiers, discovered the body of Harold still among the living, but almost [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] drained of the fountain of life. He was borne to a tent, where his wound was examined and pronounced not in itself mortal, though the great loss of blood he had sustained rendered his recovery doubtful. His youth, a good constitution, and a patient firmness, at length by slow degrees overcame his extreme debility, and in due time he was able to walk abroad. Conscious, however, that the lingering debility which not only weighed his body but his spirit to the earth, would for some time incapacitate him for active service, he asked and obtained leave of absence and returned home, where he found everything precisely in the same place he had left it, and Gilbert just about setting out the dinner table, as usual. The good old man was so surprised at seeing him, that he dropt a bundle of spoons he carried in his hand, which so discomfited him that he forgot to welcome his young master, till he had carefully picked them up again. Harold returned to Habingdon an altered man. During the period of his service his religious and political opinions had settled down on the platform of the most rigid of the sect of the Puritans. He had fought and bled for them, and they had become more precious for the price. The habit of fighting against his king, had quite effaced all reverence for his authority; and the example of those with whom he had daily associated in danger and death, gradually made him a thorough convert, not only to their opinions, but their manners and habits. He had become a Roundhead and republican. His deportment was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] characterized by a sour austerity, which scorned all appearance of gaiety, and seldom relaxed into a smile. A secret feeling of superiority over those he chose to call the wicked, at war with Christian humility, had gradually insinuated itself into his heart, and generated that spiritual pride so utterly unworthy the spirit of Christianity and its author. So far as respected his principles and conduct, he was a man of the strictest integrity; but he had ceased to be amiable, and though gifted with qualities that might gain respect, could scarcely hope to be loved by those around him. It was long ere he thoroughly recovered; and during the period of his convalescence the Royal cause was ruined, and the King in the hands of his enemies. His party ceased to make head in the field, and it was not long before the errors and weaknesses, which would have been more venial had they not been those of a sovereign, were atoned by a death inflicted by The Judges of Kings, who taught him by sad experience, that monarchs are not alone accountable to heaven for their actions, but that there is a High Tribunal on earth to which they may be brought for judgment. Hitherto kings had paid the forfeit of their crimes against the people, by becoming the victims of conspiracy, assassination, and war; but now for the first time did a sovereign fall by the axe of the executioner, according to the forms, at least, of law and justice. It was a memorable example, and, say what we will, a sublime spectacle, to see a monarch atoning for his offences against his people, like one of the people. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] punishment may have been illegal, but who shall say it was not just. Harold had left the service, sometime previous to the death of the King, in consequence of his regiment being disbanded, and remained at home, a quiet though deeply interested observer of those succeeding struggles and intrigues, by which unprincipled, ambitious men at length justly forfeited that freedom it had cost so much blood to acquire. They had united in achieving victory, but quarreled about the division of the spoils; or to do them justice, perhaps it may have been that a difference of opinion as to the adoption of a new system of government was one great cause of those divisions which were now approaching a crisis. But Harold had another subject which approached nearer his heart. He had not forgotten Susan Baneswright; and his deep-rooted affection for that orphan girl was only more quickened by the recollection that she was now without a father or protector. He sought her, and instituted inquiries in all directions that afforded the least hope of success, but could gain no clue to guide him in his further search, and finally sat down in despair of ever seeing her again. This disappointment of the dearest of his earthly hopes only increased the gloomy severity of his devotion, for religion and love are in some degree antidotes to each other, and the disappointments of the heart often seek consolation in devotion. While in this state of mind, circumstances not material to our story called him to a distant part of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] country not far from the borders of Wales. It was midsummer, the weather soft and balmy, and the landscape everywhere displayed that rich redundancy of green pasture for which old England is so renowned. One evening towards sunset, as he rode along, buried in contemplations in which the past predominated over the present and future, he was roused from his reverie by the sudden darkness which came upon him, occasionally illuminated by flashes of lightning, followed by quick crashes of thunder. At once the present resumed its empire, and, as often happens in this world of sudden changes, the pains of memory were banished by the prospect of an approaching shower. The anticipation of a wet jacket is a sovereign remedy for sentimental regrets. It has a marvellous cooling influence on the fever of the spirits and acts as a showerbath on the heated brain. Powerful as is the influence of memory and imagination, reality is stronger than either or both combined; and notwithstanding all that may have been said or sung of mental sorrows, they fade away like spectres before the stern realities of physical suffering. The Patriarch Job bore the loss of his cattle, his houses, and his children without a murmur; but when his body was covered with boils, and he writhed in the agonies of pain, he groaned aloud, and his patience was conquered. Be this as it may, Harold pricked on his weary steed in hope of gaining some friendly shelter in cottage, barn, or outhouse. But the storm proved too swift in the race, and he was overtaken by a pelting [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] rain opposite a rustic temple of learning, the small fry of which had just been dismissed for the day, and scampered home, anxious to escape a ducking. This being the only place of shelter in sight, he forthwith rode up to it, and fastening his horse to a post, opened the door, through which he bolted without knocking; your pelting shower being a great enemy to ceremony. The first object that caught his attention was a female, who seemed somewhat alarmed at his intrusion, for she trembled violently, and her face was very pale. A second glance, followed by a fixed gaze of intense interest, disclosed to Harold the object which had so long occupied his thoughts, and influenced his actions. It was Susan Baneswright, who at once recognising him, after a slight hesitation came forward, addressed him by name, and offered her hand, with a pensive smile of chastened welcome. Years had passed away since they parted, yet in gazing on her he could see little change in her face or person. The attractive power of her face depended not on color but expression; and the placid firmness of her mind, as well as the gentleness of her temper, had preserved her in the midst of great trials from those violent emotions of passion which undermine the constitution, and perhaps more than any other cause, contribute to shorten as well as embitter the brief period of existence allotted to men. Her face still wore that sweet expression of submissive melancholy, which had from the first irresistibly called forth his sympathy; while her person, clothed in the simplest fashion and most homely [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] texture, was yet graceful from its natural proportions, as well as attractive from the absence of all affectation. It will be recollected that Harold had never disclosed his attachment in words, except to her father, who she had neither seen nor heard from since the interview heretofore recorded; and if she had become conscious of his feelings, it was doubtless through the medium of that mysterious sympathy said to constitute a sort of magnetic telegraph, but which after all is perhaps nothing more than the dumb eloquence of the eyes. The meeting, therefore, was not that of mutual lovers, but long separated friends. Though friendly, perhaps cordial, it was accompanied by that sober, staid formality peculiar to the sect to which they belonged; and not a word passed that could be translated into the language of love. We will not say as much of their looks, or that the eye did not make ample amends for the delinquency of the tongue. After mutual greetings, the storm being passed away as suddenly as it came, Harold leading his horse by the bridle, accompanied Susan to her abode in a small hamlet, which though close at hand, was hid by a green wooded hill that soared above the rustic chimneys. She resided with an elderly widowed dame, whose husband had died fighting against his king, and who was of the strictest sect of the Puritans. The pious widow received Harold somewhat ungraciously; but being apprised by Susan that he was an old friend of her father, and of course of the right stamp, she abated somewhat of her acidity, and accorded him her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] blessing. While busily occupied with her household affairs, the which she accompanied occasionally with a hymn of more piety than poetry, Harold and Susan being left to themselves entered into mutual details of their past history. Harold related the principal incidents of his life since they parted, omitting the scene after the battle of Naseby, as well as the particulars of Israel's visit, and dwelling slightly on his anxious search for Susan. The narrative of Susan was one of grief and suffering. On leaving the prison they had continued to lead a sort of itinerant life. Israel exhorted the people to rise in their might and smite the Philistines, until at length excited beyond all restraint by continually hearing of the vicissitudes of the conflict, now at its height, he girded on his sword, and proceeded to join the army of Cromwell, who he considered the chiefest of the saints. Here he exhorted and fought with equal enthusiasm, until he met his death on the famous field of Naseby, while hotly pursuing a flying squadron of loyalists, and exhorting his companions to scatter the armies of Gog and Magog like chaff before the winds. But of this catastrophe Susan knew nothing certain, though accustomed to consider him as dead. Not long after the departure of Israel, his wife, worn out by the hardships and exposures she had encountered as well from duty and affection to her helpmate as from pious conviction, gradually declined in her health, and sunk into the grave, leaving Susan without a protector, save the good woman in whose house she now resided. Not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] to be a burden to her, she had managed to gather together a little school, from which she derived a homely support, which sufficed for all her wants. When her story was finished, she anxiously inquired of Harold if he could give her any information concerning the fate of her father. Without entering into minute particulars, he communicated the death of Israel on the field of Naseby and the information was received with humble resignation, as only confirming what she had long believed. After a pause devoted to filial piety and love, she addressed Harold with mingled sorrow and resignation. "The will of Heaven be done. I have long believed myself without a parent, without a home, and without a friend, save him who has promised to protect those who have no other protector. My dear mother breathed her last in my arms; I saw her die, and her last words were spoken to me. Of my father's fate, though well assured something serious had befallen him, I was ignorant till now, and the certainty, fearful as it may be, is less painful than uncertainty without hope. There is one thing yet left me. I have still duties to perform, and it is a blessed dispensation that the indigent, in administering to the wants of others, provide for their own." The heart of Harold swelled with overwhelming emotion at this affecting lesson of philosophic piety. A flood of tenderness rushed to his heart, and he could no longer restrain his emotions. "Susan," he exclaimed---"Dear Susan, do not say [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] you are alone in the world without a home or a friend, when one such stands before you to whom you are dear as the apple of his eye, the breath of his life---I might almost say, the welfare of his soul---" "Forbear, Harold"---interrupted Susan---"forbear, Harold Habingdon. Place not thine immortal part in comparison with thy mortal affections. Thy heart thou mayest give away; thy soul belongs to God." "Nay, hear me, Susan. From the moment I exchanged that last look at the prison door, my thoughts have dwelt on thee by day and by night, in sickness and health, in the calm hour of contemplation, and in the hurry of battle. In the jail when forsaken and perishing with hunger, hopeless of relief, and often wandering from myself, so long as my mind retained its consciousness, I thought of thee. And when I lay gasping on the field of blood, with nothing but woe and death around me, still I thought of thee---" "Forbear, Harold---forbear. This is no time to talk on such a subject. It becomes me now to mourn the breaking of former ties, rather than think of new ones." "Forgive me, Susan---we have met by accident, and accident may soon part us. Let me tell thee all, and then answer truly, as thy heart may dictate. When after retiring from the army, I recovered from my wound, I sought thee wherever I thought it probable thou mightest be found, nor did I rest until all hope of finding thee was gone. We have at length met, and chance has done for me what my own exertions [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] could not accomplish. Let us never, I beseech thee, part again. Like thee, I stand alone in the world. I am the last of my race, with none to share my thoughts, or control my actions; and thou, dearest Susan, thou art a stricken deer, alone in a forest, without a protector. I offer you a refuge and a home; I offer you a heart devoted to your happiness and I expect a decisive answer. Speak to me, my beloved--- answer me, are we never to part, or never to meet again?" For the first time since he had known her, the steady, well-poised mind of Susan seemed shaken to its base. During this address she became greatly agitated by a struggle which relieved itself neither by tears or words. At length recovering in some degree, she raised her eyes to his, and perceiving the eager expectation with which he awaited a reply meekly said--- "What can I bring as my dower but poverty and misfortune. My inheritance, alas! is disappointed hopes, and sorrowful recollections. "What canst thou bring me"---cried Harold, the deep-buried enthusiasm and energy of his character bursting forth like a torrent long pent up---"Thou canst bring me the most precious of all earthly dowers, a gentle, pious, virtuous wife, in whom I may trust with the faith of a martyr. Thou canst bring me peace, content, joy, and felicity. Thou canst make my house the abode of happiness, and its master the most blessed of men. Talk not then of poverty and misfortune---I have enough to ward off one, and my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] watchful care will, with the blessing of Heaven, shield thee from the other. Answer me, Susan, wilt thou be mine---wilt thou entrust thy happiness to me for this life? One word---and give thy hand as a token." "I will"---whispered the maiden, and gave him her hand. At that moment love triumphed over the self-denying ordinances of the sect; he pressed her to his bosom; he kissed her with all the ardor of long continued abstinence suddenly bidden to a plenteous feast, while Susan, doubtless taken by surprise, quietly submitted to the inexorable canons of nature. The contract being thus sealed, Harold related to her the occasion of his journey, and besought Susan to become his bride on his return, which would be in a few days. But here her unconquerable sense of duty presented an insurmountable obstacle. She had engaged herself as a teacher during a period of which more than a month remained, and steadily refused to break her engagement, though he eagerly offered to compound with the villagers. "No, Harold," said she, "I will not violate one engagement, however unimportant, while about to enter into another so solemn and lasting"---adding, with the first happy smile he had ever seen light up her pensive brow, and which made her look almost beautiful---"I fear thou wilt not trust me hereafter as a wife, if I prove faithless to these little children." Harold respected her scruples, and after appointing the day on which he was to return and claim his bride, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] bade Susan a farewell, which caused her cheek to wax almost as red as her lips. As he left the house he heard the good mistress of the mansion chaunting with awful nasal twang, the following lines, that seemed ominous. "Why should vain mortals hope for bliss, In such a wicked world as this, Where Satan goes about in wrath, And sin lurks in each pilgrim's path."

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] The journey of Harold was agreeably solaced by the recollection of certain passages at arms that had, as hinted at in the preceding chapter, taken place between himself and Susan, as well as by the anticipation of their speedy renewal, with additions and improvements. They say still water runs deepest, and there is another venerable proverb, to a like purpose, not quite genteel enough for the verbal squeamishness of the present age, which, with due deference be it spoken, swallows down whole mouthfuls of abominations disguised in the delicate embroidery of exquisitely harmless words, and while it strains at a gnat, religiously swallows a camel. Be this as it may; an old friend, to whom we are indebted for all the wisdom expended in this work, assures us it is a fact verified by his own experience, that the melting of the ice in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] the heart of a staid, sober, abstemious gentleman is invariably succeeded by a terrible overflowing of the long imprisoned waters, which like an autumnal freshet, carries all before it, tearing up the ground into the bargain. It is not therefore wise, he says, to turn our backs in sour disdain on the good things spread out before us by the bounty of Providence; to consider them, not as benefactions to be partaken of in sober moderation, but as temptations purposely laid in our way as practical lessons of self-denial. Those enjoyments which neither injure ourselves, interfere with the happiness of others, or violate the laws and decorums of society, are in fact in themselves most effectual barriers against the indulgence of those criminal propensities which at one and the same time undermine our own happiness and destroy that of others. Give to mankind innocent amusements, and they will be far less likely to seek for guilty pleasures. But it will generally be found that those who whet their appetites, by rigorously abstaining from one enjoyment, are the most voracious in the gratification of others; and that he who rails most loudly at the ninety-nine innocent pleasures of life most commonly selects the hundredth, as an exception, and converts it into a vice, by excessive indulgence. These remarks, continues the prosing old gentleman, apply to all ages, but most especially to that gay and joyous season when free from the cares of manhood, and the infirmities of age, the youthful spirit seems fairly entitled to nature's vernal holiday. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] Those who view with impatient spleen their merry gambols, or listen with sour disdain to the jocund laugh, that springs from all absence from care, as well as freedom from pain, might as well find fault with the spring for producing nothing but blossoms. But to resume our tale. Harold certainly verified the old gentleman's theory, for he was in a tumult of hopes and anticipations, unworthy a person who had so long valued himself on his contempt for sublunary enjoyments. The ice had suddenly melted; his ardent soul which had been ere while occupied in curbing the steed, now relaxed the bridle, or rather dropped it entirely, and made itself full amends for the past by anticipations of the future. The sturdy Puritan actually took to castle building, and had his horse been as much in love as himself, it is extremely questionable whether on his return home, he would not have been lost in the Fens of Lincolnshire. But owing to the sagacity of the discreet animal, he arrived in safety, but not until after missing his way occasionally when he came to a cross-road. Here with the aid of old Gilbert, he set about putting his household in order for the reception of its new mistress, during which it was an observation of Gilbert, that his young master neither sung psalms, or prayed as often as usual, and twice missed a conventicle. Time always limps, when driven too fast. He has something of the donkey, and if you attempt to prick him beyond his usual speed, will but out his forefeet, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] make a dead stand, and bray most vociferously. It was thus with Harold, who was out of all patience, and put Gilbert almost out of his wits, by hurrying the dinner every day, as if that would hasten the march of time. "Gilbert," said he one day, "what day of the week is it?" Gilbert considered the matter maturely and answered, "Friday, sir." "'Slife, I thought it was Saturday," said Harold, turning away impatiently, to the infinite astonishment of Gilbert, who had never heard his young master come so nigh swearing before. But time is withal a sure-footed steed, and never fails to reach the end of his journey at last. The fated hour arrived, and Harold, dressed in a new suit, that actually smacked a little of the cavalier, departed on his mission, from which he in due time returned with his wife. Without entering into minute details, which however are a great help to an author in time of sore distress, when the catastrophe of his story threatens to pounce upon him, long before his two volumes are completed---we shall be content with observing that for the usual period which it is said is governed by the moon---he enjoyed as much happiness as is good for mankind. But whether it be that there is that in the institution of matrimony, which like a magnifying glass causes the merest trifles to appear important, or that the parties are drawn into such intimate communion that they cannot conceal, or be blind to the faults or foibles of each other, or that familiarity produces the result which has become [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] proverbial, certain it is, that after the expiration of that period so hallowed in the annals of wedded life, Harold and Susan were not quite so happy as they had anticipated. All men, says our wise old friend, and as is affirmed by scandalous persons, all women have a way of their own, and like to have their own way. Now there is an infinite variety of nothings in domestic life, which though in themselves of no consequence, constitute the most fruitful source of trifling disagreements and contradictions that too often in the end produce coolness, if not alienation. We have somewhere heard of a couple of the fondest, best tempered people in the world, who unfortunately, one day, in the middle of a long, gloomy, drizzly week in November, during which the sun suffered a total eclipse, fell into an argument on the question whether people have ten fingers, or only eight fingers and two thumbs. They parted without settling the question, and the next day it was renewed with additional vivacity. The habit grew upon them, and each party waxed more warm as well as obstinate. They began to complain bitterly of the peevishness of each other, and finally agreed to a separation on the ground of incompatibility of temper. Were it possible to penetrate the deep mysteries of wedlock, it would probably be found that in a vast many, perhaps a majority of cases, matrimonial dissentions arise from a difference of opinion on matters of not the least consequence and to which the parties are totally indifferent. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] Harold was a man of principle. He did everything on principle, and often applied his principles to things that involved no principle whatever. Susan, too, was governed by principle; she was obstinately good, though to do her justice, it was only passive obstinacy, that of non-resistance. No earthly motive could tempt her to do wrong, or act against her settled conviction. It would have been better for both, had they confined their adherence to principle to those acts which involve the obligations of duty to ourselves and others; but they went much farther, and when there was neither right or wrong in the case, strictly adhered to principle. Yet with all this, Susan possessed a temper of the sweetest complacency, and never on any occasion contended with her husband. When, as sometimes happened, Harold found fault with her, she would only ply her needle with greater rapidity, and exclaim---"My dear, I don't hear---I don't hear." That perseverance, our old friend continues, nay, obstinacy in doing right is a noble characteristic in man or woman cannot be denied; and yet it requires to be kept within certain bounds, or it may chance to degenerate into obstinacy in doing wrong. Nothing is more common than to mistake prejudice for principle, or the suggestions of passion for the dictates of reason. The desire of having our own way, the mere indulgence of the will is often the substitute for a conviction of right, and in many, very many cases what is called acting on principle, is only an excuse for a determination to do as we please. Even conscience is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] not always an infallible guide, else we had not so often seen whole nations forgetting the obligations of humanity, charity and justice, and exterminating each other for a mere difference of opinion. It is however the best we have; and though partaking in the common weakness of our nature, should be handled with gloves, least from a sleeping lamb it becomes a raging tiger. There are a vast many occasions, most especially in the daily intercourse of domestic life, in which it is not worth while to be obstinate, and where opposition is oftener the result of wilfulness than reason. It is in yielding to others, in such small affairs, that what is called good nature consists. This is the honey that sweetens the cup of human life; the great cement of our social relations, which consists as much in mutual forbearance, as in mutual good offices. A married pair should equally keep clear of the two extremes, of absolute independence, and grovelling submission. Most especially should they avoid all argument, which is only another name for contention. The wise old gentleman from whom we have again quoted, is clearly of this opinion, and earnestly recommends the example of a friend of his, who whenever his wife expresses dissent to any opinion, or proposition, invariably replies, "well, my dear, then there is an end to the argument,"---takes up his hat, and quietly goes about his business. The same old gentleman begs to caution our readers against a fundamental error of a certain married couple, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] with whom he was on terms of intimacy, whose domestic harmony was grievously undermined, by a habit of contending, not which should have his, or her way, but which should concede it to the other. This produced very serious conflicts, which generally ended in the husband exclaiming, "Zounds, madam, do you think to always have your own way? I desire you to understand that I too have a will of my own." The old gentleman, however, observes, that this is rather an uncommon case, and constitutes an exception. He further remarks, that argument between the rival domestic powers, is most especially dangerous, where both parties agree; and affirms he has seen two people exceedingly discomposed, at finding after a long and warm discussion, there was in fact no difference of opinion. The gentle and impatient reader will pardon us, if we occasionally indulge in a little wholesome digression, though in opposition to certain critics, who lay it down as one of the orthodox canons of criticism, that a story is like a top, which breaks down the moment it stands still. The author, they affirm, should be constantly whipping his top, to prevent this catastrophe, and the more it hums the better for both himself and his reader. Like old Virginia, he must never tire, nor linger on his way, to pluck a flower, or sketch some lovely scene of nature that wooes him as he passes along. "Sentiment, sir,"---ordained one of these infallible doctors---"sentiment is impertinent, and morality out of place in a story. It is as bad as mint sauce to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] venison, or stuffing to a canvas-back duck. It is out of place, sir---it interrupts the progress of the story, which should be all action, passion, adventure, blood, murder, fire, fury, fretting, fuming, and phrenzy This is what I call power; it is the steam that gives motion to the engine, and sets the author and his reader going at the rate of thirty miles an hour. The most racy book I ever read was an abridgement of the Romances of Mrs. Radcliffe and some others, in which all the connecting links were left out, and nothing retained but the incidents." We agree perfectly with our thunderbolt of a critic, but shall not follow his precepts. We don't see why an author has not as good a right to please himself, as his readers have to be pleased. The latter buy his book at their peril, and if it should chance not to please them, they can take the worth of their money in abusing him soundly. This is what statesmen call reciprocity. Now we confess, that though in the downhill of life, and much nearer the bottom than the top, we like to roam about a little out of the direct course of narrative, even if we pluck only weeds in our way, and have a decided antipathy to authors who cannot be dull whenever they please. The only legitimate excuse for publishing a book is, that the writer either is, or fancies himself, wiser than all the rest of the world put together. He should, therefore, take the bit between his teeth at the first start, and follow his own way, regardless of his riders, the critics. If they should chance to pelt him with old shoes, or hiss him [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] as he passes, he has an infallible resource in the judgment of posterity. Let him appeal to the great court of chancery, whose function it is to reprieve an author after he has been hanged, drawn, and quartered. But although the preceding speculations may seem a wanton digression, the judicious reader will, if we are not mistaken, detect their bearing on the sequel of our narrative. Years passed away, and notwithstanding the little breezes that ruffled the surface of the stream of life and shook the verdant leaves, without causing them to fall, Harold and Susan continued to enjoy themselves in comparative peace. The only events of consequence that happened during this period, were the birth of a daughter, which shook the leaves a little when about to give her a name, and the death of honest Gilbert Taverner, who had never held up his venerable head since the luckless day when his mistress commanded him to change the disposition of the salt-cellars at dinner. The first time he did this, his hand trembled so that he spilled the entire contents of one, and was so agitated, that though the salt fell between himself and his mistress, he forgot the indispensable ceremony of casting a portion over his left shoulder. To the conviction that a terrible feud was at hand between his mistress and himself, was added another, to wit, that the House of Habingdon was nodding to its fall; concerning which he had been assured by his grandfather, who was accounted almost as old [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] as Methusalah, there was an ancient prophecy which ran as follows:--- When ye saulte sal daunce aboute ye tabelle, Then tymes wille comme ryghte execrabelle, And ye olde house of Habingdonne, See tymes ytte sal never see agone. Sancte Rumbold and Sancte Frideswyde, Keepe ys houe, or wae betyde. Gilbert had never before heard of either of these Sanctes; but ever after continued to pray devoutly for their good offices in behalf of the House of Habingdon, until in later times, he gradually imbibed such an orthodox antipathy to the entire Roman Calendar, and such a horror of St. Peter especially, that he could scarcely refrain from railing against his fellow apostles. He felt assured that a house that had no better support than Sancte Rumbold and Sancte Frideswyde, could not stand forever, and in fact wondered at its having stood so long. In short he had become a convert to his master's opinions, or rather example, and cherished such a virulent prejudice against the Pope, whom he always denounced in orthodox phrase, together with all the adjuncts, appurtenances, and ceremonies of Popery, that he abjured the four cardinal points, and lost all respect for prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude, when told they were cardinal virtues. The good old man---for he was as honest as the day, and as harmless as a ghost, soon pined away under the innovations of his mistress, and his fears for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] the House of Habingdon. His brief remaining history is that of all the human race; he sickened, died, was buried and forgotten by all but the author of this tale. In the meantime, Harold remained at home, a quiet though by no means an uninterested spectator of passing events. He formed no intimacies with his neighbors, who were of different sects, and received few visitors but travelling preachers of his own persuasion, whose zeal not unfrequently approached the burning confines of fanaticism. With this exception, the daily routine of his life would have become tedious by its uniformity, had he not found perpetual excitement in the increasing fervency of his devotions, which gradually filled up a great portion of his time, and precluded all amusements or relaxation. He warred against rural pleasures, and rustic recreations; the merry song of the milk-maid was hushed in his domain; the sound of laughter never echoed within his walls; he often turned distastefully from the smile of the infant Miriam, now beginning to sport and prattle; and was only reconciled to the music of the merry minstrels of the morning, by the idea that they were chaunting their spiritual songs. Though a man of more than ordinary talents, and of undoubted worth, he was not liked by his inferiors, or popular among his equals. His wife was gentle and affectionate, and his daughter obeyed him implicitly; but the feeling they cherished towards him was what the Indian meant, when he wished to describe that of his tribe for white men---it was that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] of "Fear-love." His limited intercourse being, as before stated, confined to a single class, instead of expanding his mind and liberalizing his principles, only served to contract the one, and render the other more rigid and intolerant. He fancied himself humble, but if so, it was only to his Maker, not towards his fellow-creatures. He became infected with the very worst species of pride---spiritual pride---and finally wrapt himself up in the mantle of self-righteousness, like the Pharisees of old. The Dissenters were now in the ascendancy, and instead of forgetting, only remembered the persecutions they had suffered, to retaliate on those who had inflicted them. The wolves in sheep's clothing, as they were opprobriously called, had now a full taste of the cup they had proffered to the lips of others; the churches changed occupants; and the universities were treated pretty much as they were at the Reformation. The Parliamentary forces had taken possession of Oxford, and their chaplains possessed themselves of the pulpits, where, as a cotemporary writer of the opposite party says---"Their preaching was the cause of great scorn in some and laughter in others; because their prayers and sermons were long and tedious; because they made wry mouths, squint eyes, and screwed faces, quite altering them from what God and nature had made them; because they had antic behavior, squeaking voices, and feeling tones, fit rather for stage players and country beggars to use, than such as were to expound the Scriptures." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] But what most excited the indignation of the loyalists, was an ordinance of the Parliamentary visitors, directing that the bellsman of the university should not go about in the customary manner, at the funeral of any member of the university; that the fashion of gowns and caps should be changed; and "that all excess and vanity in powdering their hair, wearing knots of ribands on their clothes and in their hats; walking in boots, spurs, and boot-hose tops," should be abandoned. Our readers may smile at those seemingly unimportant matters, but the history of religious dissentions will inform them that lesser causes than these have set the world in arms, and deluged the earth with blood. It requires the utmost exertion of despotic power to change the fashion of a hat, the cut of the coat, or the mode of wearing the hair. But though the enemies of royalty had got the upper hand, and gained the prize they sought, the most difficult and delicate crisis had not been passed. The rights for which the patriots had struggled were indeed attained, but it seemed they knew not what to do with them; and the establishment of a new government proved a more difficult task than that of pulling down an old one. The labor of removing the rubbish was greater than that of erecting a new building and in addition to this, the workmen employed differed altogether in the plan of the edifice. Presbyterians, Puritans, Anabaptists, Brownists, Levelers, and Independents were mixed pell-mell together, without any cement to the heterogenous mass; and Harold began [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] seriously to apprehend, that if this state of things continued much longer, the people, tired of being tossed about at random on the ever-changing ocean, would eventually seek the old haven, and voluntarily give back what they had forcibly wrested away. His fears were realized even sooner than he anticipated, and he believed his old commander, Cromwell, invested with a power greater than that of royalty, though masked under a different name. It could scarcely be called a usurpation, since in reality no established authority existed in England. The royal power was in abeyance. The sceptre lay in Oliver's way, and he found it. Anarchy can only be cured by despotism; and when contending factions, each equally incapable of maintaining that permanent ascendancy which is indispensable to the peace and order of communities, are steering the vessel of state at random, amid shoals and quicksands, the master-mind must seize the helm, to secure a safe harbor, and to do this he must be sole commander. Harold, as before hinted, had almost imperceptibly become a sturdy republican, or Seceder, as they were denominated by the cavaliers---and the elevation of Cromwell, to the supreme power of the state, galled him sorely. His death after a few years of brilliant successes, in which he did much for England, but little for his own happiness; the accession and abdication of his son Richard; the erection of a council of state; and at length the restoration of Charles the Second without conditions, all followed in quick [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] succession. Thus the same men, though still in the meridian of life, had lived to see those rights which had been purchased by years of civil commotion and bloodshed, voluntarily surrendered back, by a people wearied by a succession of changes, which placed them perpetually at the mercy of cabals and factions. It was at this period, that Harold, disgusted with the abortive issue of that great struggle, in which he had prayed, fought and bled; and apprehensive of the return of those persecutions, which in his heart he could not deny the Puritans had justly merited by their conduct during their ascendancy, began to meditate a decisive movement. When he witnessed the frivolity of manners, the relaxation of morals, and the insulting ridicule heaped on the heads of the Puritans, his heart swelled with mingled sorrow and indignation, and he turned his thoughts to the far off wilderness of the West, where, among the savage Pagans, he hoped to find that toleration which Christian charity had hitherto withheld. The vision of the medina of a new world, whither already the victims of persecution had sought and found a refuge, had often flitted before his fancy previous to this despicable termination of a great revolution, made little by the littleness of men. But it was at this time considered a daring enterprize, requiring not only courage, hardihood, and self-denial, but a pious confidence in the support and direction of Providence. Harold possessed all these requisites, and having at length with cautious deliberation decided on his course, proceeded promptly to carry it out. His [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] first step was to propose it to Susan, who though accustomed to buffet the ills of life, shrunk from such hardships, dangers, and privations, as she had heard detailed by eye witnesses, returned from the land of the Pilgrims. "I love my country, Susan," said Harold---"I have shed my blood in what I thought, and still think, a great and good cause, and I am ready to do it again, whenever there is any hope it will not be shed in vain. But I have lived to see that freedom which I had hoped to achieve sacrificed to that very family which has endeavored to crush it for generations past. I have lived to see all sorts of profaneness, lewdness, luxury, and vice, spreading far and wide, through the example of the King and his courtiers, by whom all virtue, decency and sobriety, are ridiculed and laughed to scorn. I see the Parliament united with the court, and ready to sacrifice the people for the wages of corruption. My countrymen are bought and sold like cattle or slaves, and no man is safe, but by bribery or flattery. It is true that our lives are as yet spared; but who can rely on the act of indemnity, or put faith in a King whose word is made a subject of ridicule by a profligate rhymster? What tie can bind a dissolute monarch, and a slavish Parliament, one of whom openly sets at defiance the commands of his Maker, while the other is equally regardless of the rights of His creatures. When I see such men as Vane, Lambert, Hardrigge, Milton and Ludlow, offered up on the scaffold, or hunted into exile, I feel a conviction that my own [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] insignificance is my only protection. Let us go, and seek in the new world what is denied in the old." "Alas, Harold"---replied the meek, submissive wife--- looking down on little Miriam, who stood wondering at the earnest energy of her father, whose discourse she hardly comprehended---"Alas! would you take me and our daughter from our home, to be buffeted by the waves of the sea, and encounter the still greater perils of the land? To bury us in the howling wilderness, where we and our posterity must sojourn with wild savages, and savage beasts, perhaps in time to become savages like them, and lose all reverence for the laws of man or the will of God? What is the new world, and what will it ever be but an unpeopled wilderness?" "Cease, Susan---thou speakest like a woman, or rather like a child. Know that the moment in which the inspired navigator, Columbus, caught sight of the new world, was fraught with consequences more extensive, important, and lasting, than ever originated in any single act of any human being that has existed since the fall of Adam. It was the recovery of a lost child of the universe, destined, if I foresee aright, to grow up into a giant, possessing all the activity of youth, all the energies of ripened manhood, and all the experience and sagacity of a green old age. It gave a new impulse to human action and enterprise; it provided a refuge from civil oppression and religious persecution; it offered a boundless field for the cramped energies of the mind and the fettered activity of the body; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] it held out rich rewards to courage and genius; it promised to enterprise wealth, to industry competence, food to the hungry, and freedom to the oppressed. The old world has long been the exclusive property of the rich and powerful; but here is one that seems expressly created for the indigent and lowly. America is the poor man's inheritance. The land we live in already grows weary of her inhabitants, insomuch that man, the most precious of all creatures, is here become more vile and base than the earth he treads upon. The social and domestic ties are as burnt flax, and children, friends and neighbors, are become burthens instead of blessings, because they stand in each others way, and the laborers are too great for the harvest. Let us quit, forever, this doomed land; let us go where men are required to carry into effect the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and can assume their proper place, as joint proprietors of that earth which was bestowed not on the eldest son, but all the posterity of Adam. Let us straightway set forth on our pilgrimage while we may. The blood of martyrs has been shed in vain, and what was won by the virtue of the people has been lost by the degeneracy of their leaders. But such is the fate of nations; they fight and conquer; they trust and are betrayed." It will be perceived, that Harold, with all his outward coat of ice, had a warm under-current of ardent enthusiasm, which flowed from the fountain of nature, and could not at times be repressed. His enthusiasm, though in a great measure absorbed in his piety, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] occasionally took another direction, and when thus awakened, flowed impetuously in its new channel. Susan was overawed, if not convinced, and expressed her submission as follows, pointing to Miriam: "This is the daughter of my affection, but thou art the husband of my earliest love. They claim is stronger than hers, and therefore, will I go whither thou goest, and risk this dear pledge to all the perils that may befall, in obedience to my heart and my duty. The earth is our mother, and we shall find our kindred dust wherever we abide." Harold ought to have kissed his wife, and thanked her for the sacrifice thus offered to conjugal duty. But like very many sturdy advocates of the right of self-government, out of doors, he did not apply the doctrine practically within. He had adopted the Salique law in domestic matters, and confined female jurisdiction to certain limits, which no republican female of our days would probably submit to, without a deal of preliminary discipline. He therefore received this concession without any special acknowledgment; for which omission, in our opinion, he forfeited all claim to the like in future. When any woman---most especially a wife---gives up an opinion, or sacrifices a wish, even though the one may be wrong, and the other unreasonable, she deserves a kiss at least, if not a suit of new drawing-room furniture from Paris. This decisive point being settled, Harold proceeded without delay to prepare for his pilgrimage to the New World, which, in our poor opinion, is a great improvement [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] on the old one in many particulars. It was some time before he could find a purchaser for his estate, to his liking, for he made a point of not disposing of it to a cavalier. One promising negotiation was broken off by a discussion on free will; another by a difference of opinion in the interpretation of a text; a third ended in a downright quarrel concerning the respective merits of Luther and Calvin; while a fourth, involving the duty of charity to all mankind, was concluded by Harold turning his antagonist out of doors. At length he succeeded in finding a chapman altogether unexceptionable, who so thoroughly agreed with him in his opinion, that everybody said he got a great bargain. Having gone through all the necessary preliminaries, it now became his painful task to take a final leave of a home hallowed by the recollections of so many centuries. It was indeed a spot equally endeared by past association and quiet rural beauty. The mansion house was neither spacious nor tasteful; on the contrary, it was by no means remarkable for its size, and had little to please the eye, save a quaint picturesque irregularity, accompanied by an aspect of most venerable antiquity, without being quite as old as the family, but sufficiently so to combine all those conveniencies of arrangement, which, owing to the progress of the age and the development of mind, are now denounced as sore inconveniences. It was of a dark slatey colored stone; the walls prodigiously thick; the ceilings prodigiously low; the windows narrow and deep; and there was a vast [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] many hiding places for rats, ghosts, refugees, and all persons that might find it convenient to be missing. A pigmy river ran in front of the house, which was seated on a pretty steep bank, terraced down to the shore, fringed with grass and decked with a long row of majestic trees that strongly smacked of the antiquity of the House of Habingdon. The windings of the little pastoral stream might be seen for miles above and below, and its murmurs, which, in the stillness of night, were distinctly heard in the sleeping rooms, might soothe into repose any but a spirit disquieted by remorse, or condemned to weary wakefulness by care and gluttony. The country all around was rich, verdant and alluring; and though the view was not very extensive, it was only the more varied as well interesting from the distinctness with which every object was presented to the eye. Nothing marred the beauty of the prospect, but the tall steeple of a neighboring parish church, of which, the wolves in sheep's clothing had again acquired possession, and on which Harold often turned his back in pious disdain. Strange that the love of our Maker should produce antipathy to His creatures! All men differ in form, face, and disposition; yet they do not cut each others' throats, or fall together by the ears on that account. But the moment they disagree in opinion, especially on subjects involving the obligations of universal charity, they seem, in their zeal to establish the abstract principle, altogether to forget its practical application. As Harold delivered the rusty old keys to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] purchaser who had come to take possession, his heart almost failed, and the ghosts of his Saxon ancestors seemed to rise up in judgment against him. Yonder under those old yew trees lay the family burying place, where rested in peaceful oblivion a long train of succeeding generations, who had followed each other in the same old track, and slept not more peaceably than they had lived together. He remembered none of these but his parents, and all his recollections were centred in their graves. He had paid them a last visit, and when he returned, his wife anxiously inquired what was the matter with him. "Nothing,"---replied he--- "I have only been bidding a last farewell to some old friends." Susan understood him and inquired no further. As they passed through the avenue of old trees that led to the high road, he cast a long, long glance at the past and an anxious look towards the future. Between the two his firmness forsook him, and a few solitary tears coursed down the cheeks of the iron Puritan. But he recovered himself almost instantly, by a mighty effort, and looked behind him no more. To Susan, the parting was marked by somewhat less emotion. She had not the same recollections and associations. She could only look back to a few years spent in the abode she was now leaving for ever, and not so much what was past she regretted, as what was to come she feared. But there is in the heart of women an innate vagrant disposition, arising probably from their confinement at home, and the sameness of their occupations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] They luxuriate in new scenes, awakening new ideas, and we have more than once seen them actually delighted with danger, simply because it produced an excitement. Susan thought more of the future and less of the past than Harold: and as they seated themselves in the carriage that was to bear them away, gazed, not on the forsaken home, but on her little girl who was weeping, she scarcely knew why. Accompanied by two servants, one of whom was the nephew of old Gilbert Taverner, and already somewhat advanced in years; the other a staid, starched, devout spinster, devotedly attached to Susan, on the score of her father, by whom she had been converted---they proceeded to London, as the most likely place, at that time, to procure a passage to America, and make their moneyed arrangements. Here they were detained a tedious time, waiting for a vessel, the only one then in preparation for the "Virginia voyage," as it was called. It will be recollected that at this period, the ignorance of the people of England, especially the more enlightened classes, in all matters relating to America, was, if possible, more profound than at the present day. Of its geographical divisions, the distance and relative position of the different sections, they had either a vague idea, or no idea at all. In the old maps and books the entire country comprised within the limits of the British Plantations was called Virginia; and the vast distances between the different parts, with the difficulties of communication, was little comprehended. People applied their experience at home, to the wild [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] regions of the west, and thoughtlessly imagined that there was no greater difficulty in making a journey or voyage from Jamestown to Boston, than from London to Edinburgh. Be this at it may, people at that time knew more of their own business, and less of that of others than they do now. It will not therefore appear so very surprising that Harold engaged his passage in a vessel bound to Virginia instead of New England, imagining there would be little difficulty in reaching the latter, either by land or sea. The truth is, he was impatient to leave England, where his religion, his manners, and principles were subjects of perpetual mockery. The profligacy of the King and his court now become open and undisguised; the general relaxation of morals and decency, partly the result of this example, partly from a spirit of opposition to the severity of the Puritans; the revival of obnoxious amusements, more especially the theatres, where the sect to which he belonged was a favorite subject of ridicule, all combined to render his abode in London little less than martyrdom. Accordingly he embarked in a vessel bound for Chesapeake Bay, carrying with him sufficient funds to purchase a principality in the wilderness. Strong as were his motives for seeking a far distant home, he could not quell a melancholy feeling, arising from mingled recollections of the past, and anxious forebodings of the future. As the vessel glided along the bank of the silver Thames, the smiling landscape seemed to beckon him to its green lawns and shady woodlands, and when at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] length the land of his nativity, childhood, youth and manhood, gradually diminished to a speck on the horizon, and finally faded from his view, he felt as if he had turned his back on the world. Stern and inflexible as was his spirit, he would have sunk under the weight of his feelings, had he not been sustained by a sentiment capable of resisting all the perils of life, and defying all the agonies of death. At this period there were no floating palaces on the seas, nor was the number of voyages so great, as to have made, as it were, a beaten track across the broad Atlantic. The vessels of that age would have made but a poor figure by the side of a Liverpool packet; and one of the most singular circumstances attending the progress of maritime discovery, is the undoubted fact, that its greatest achievements were performed in vessels which at this later period would be held inadequate to a coasting voyage; and that, too, without the aid of nautical almanacs, or charts to guide them. It would require a stout-hearted mariner of these times to adventure a voyage across the Atlantic, in one of the caravels of the great Columbus. Yet in such a one, did the daring and inspired enthusiast--- for such he was, with all his cool self-possession---in such a frail barque, did he launch out into the untracked ocean, in which keel had never yet ploughed a furrow, and straight as an arrow from the Indian bow, proceed to his destined mark, until he "gave a new world to Castile and Leon," for which he was repaid by fetters. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] The clumsy barque proceeded slowly, buffeting, or rather being buffeted by the unceremonious waves, and soon approved herself without speed or bottom; for it was not long before the pumps were constantly going. The captain, an avaricious tarpaulin, had stinted his allowance of provisions to a short voyage, and as it soon appeared that this would be a long one, he began, prudently in time, to prepare for what he saw was coming, by "hauling taut his sheets," as he called it in nautical phrase---to wit---by dealing out his provisions with a sparing hand. In approaching the southern latitudes, they sometimes lay becalmed on the melancholy waste, under a broiling sun, and wallowing amid the long rolling waves without making any head-way; at others they were irresistibly driven by tempests, far out of their course; and as they approached the coast, became the sport of currents, that put them sadly out of their reckoning. In addition to these annoyances, there were three or four roystering cavaliers, younger sons, who having exhausted their money and credit at the ordinaries, had taken the "Virginia voyage" in hopes of marrying an Indian heiress, with a kingdom for her dower. These were a knot of noisy, merry, reckless rogues, with more wit than wisdom, and more generosity than prudence. Nothing could make them serious; and when by degrees they were all put on quarter rations, they made a jest even of hunger, becoming more merry and noisy than ever. Added to this, they had a variety of jests and ludicrous anecdotes of the Crop-ears, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] they took peculiar pleasure in repeating before Harold, who though he preserved an outward coolness and indifference, had much ado, to quell those sturdy rebels, flesh and blood, so often victorious over the spirit. He imagined he forgave them; but it is to be feared that he only nourished a deeper inward feeling, by repressing all outward demonstrations. It is indeed astonishing how knocking a man down contributes to harmonize the irritated spirit, and how much sooner we forgive an insult that we have promptly avenged, than one we have quietly pocketed. The wise old gentleman at our elbow is of opinion that when two persons are fairly at feud, it is on the whole better, as the phraze is, "to fight it out, at once," than nourish a bitter spleen, that produces perpetual contention, or secret ill offices, which though not amounting to breaches of the peace, occasion wounds far more painful and incurable. But the longest voyage, as well as the longest story, must have an end. At length they reached the capes of the Chesapeake, and gliding into comparatively smooth water, the good ship seemed so greatly relieved, that she careered gallantly with wind and tide, past Willoughby Point, and Old Point Comfort, into Hampton Roads, whence in due time, she anchored off the cradle of the new world, where the passengers were landed in a state of miserable exhaustion. Though the old cavaliers, who had gathered together on the appearance of the vessel---a rare occurrence---stiffened their tails a little at the appearance of a Crop-ear, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] their prejudices speedily yielded to the generous impulses of hospitality, still inherent in their posterity, and they forgot their ancient prejudices against his faith, in sympathy for his sufferings.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] Harold was now in a new world, where everything was changed, except himself, his wife, and his daughter. The broad river, so different from the dwarfish stream to which he had been so long accustomed; the dark interminable forest that bounded the prospect in every direction, hiding the bounteous earth from the rays of the sun and the eyes of her children, and silent as the abodes of the dead, except when awakened by the long quivering howl of the hungry wolf, or prowling savage; the absence of cultivation, except in little spots, few and far between; the homely simplicity of the houses, as well as the furniture; together with many other marked peculiarities, presented a contrast to the world he had just left behind, not altogether unpleasing, since it awakened new [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] impressions in his mind. Susan, too, was filled with wonder, and Miriam, now on the verge of woman-hood, was half-pleased, half-frightened, when the tall feathered redman patted her head and called her Pappoose. His first inquiries speedily convinced him of the difficulty in finding his way, promptly, to the Land of the Pilgrims; and he discovered to all intents and purposes, he was further off than ever, if obstacles may be said to constitute distance. To proceed thither by land was out of the question. The intervening country, with here and there an exception, was little else than a wilderness, through which none but savages could find their way, and presented a combination of dangers as well as difficulties. At this period, too, opportunities of going by sea were of extremely rare occurrence. Only once in a great while a coaster would creep along shore, and feel its way into the Chesapeake, with a cargo of notions. The sole commercial produce of Virginia was tobacco, and the Pilgrims were no smokers. It might be a year, or more, ere one of these adventurous navigators made his appearance. Harold therefore remained at the little capital, for some time in a state of doubt and hesitation as to the course he should pursue. During this period his situation was rather irksome. He was displeased with the tone of manners that prevailed among the cavaliers, and more than once fretted by allusions to Crop-ears, Roundheads, and Levellers. Though surrounded by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] dangers, beset by hardships, and often in danger of perishing by famine, the emigrants to Jamestown were a gay, thoughtless race, and seemed to have caught from the neighboring savages that improvidence of the future, which is one of their leading characteristics. They were not much given to long prayers, or spiritual songs; they were equally loyal and orthodox, though they claimed the right of representation, as well as of being governed by their own laws; and were occasionally fined for not attending church on the Sabbath. With all this they were hospitable, brave and generous, though as before hinted, they could not forbear a fling at the Roundheads, and had Harold been considered a permanent denizen, he would have been placed in the unpleasant predicament of being obliged to listen to the preaching of one of the "wolves in sheep's clothing," or suffer a fine, perhaps imprisonment. As yet however he was ignorant of this pleasant alternative, and having made acquaintance with some of Oliver's old soldiers, who had come over at the Restoration, he by degrees grew more reconciled to his new position, though feeling every day the inconveniences of having no home, as well as the anxiety of not being able to find one elsewhere. The situation of his wife and daughter was still more unpleasant, particularly that of the latter. A young unmarried damsel was a rara avis in this portion of the new world, and Harold was several times offered a hogshead of tobacco for Miriam, by grave old cavaliers, seeking a helpmate for their sons. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] Under these circumstances, and influenced, perhaps, by the persuasions of his wife and daughter, who were exceedingly anxious to have a permanent home, he at length determined to purchase a plantation, then for sale, on the south side of the river, and at the distance of several miles from the capital. Thither he carried his family and took up his abode, greatly to the satisfaction of all, especially of old Mildred, who had been more than once hooted at by the boys, while singing pious hymns at her window. In the interim of putting his household in order, he was hospitably received and entertained by the proprietor of the adjoining estate, who added to these attentions his advice and assistance, with an off-hand frankness and liberality which seems a growth of the soil of the new world. Of this gentleman, it is proper to say something more particular, as he will figure largely in the ensuing narrative. The father of Mr. Hugh Tyringham, as this gentleman was called, was the scion of a younger branch of a very ancient and noble family, that had become illustrious by changing sides some sixteen or eighteen times during the wars of York and Lancaster, but withal was much more distinguished for its blood than its money. For several generations, the younger sons had been compelled to live by their sword, or their wits, as the family estate was barely sufficient to enable the eldest son on whom it was entailed to marry and keep up the breed. In cases of this kind, it is usual in almost all enlightened Christian countries, to give these [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] unlucky outcasts who are disinherited by their birth a tolerable education, and then quarter them on the country for a maintenance. Though deprived of their share of the family property, they are welcome to the family interest, which is always zealously exerted in their behalf; and though the fortunate inheritor of the estate is prohibited from selling any portion of it to benefit the unlucky " Desdichado ," it is said he not unfrequently sells himself for that benevolent purpose. The father of the gentleman now introduced to the reader was, like his father before him, a younger son, and consequently destined to become a protege of his country. He received a good education, and acquired the fashionable accomplishments of the age, which together with a purse of gold, a good steed, a competent outfit of rich raiment---an expensive article at that time---and the parental blessing, constituted his business capital. The court was at that period the great point of attraction to this species of adventurers, and a handsome person the foundation of a man's fortune; his Majesty King James the First, then on the throne, as well as his immediate predecessor, being a great admirer of masculine beauty. The young gentleman in question possessed a face and figure in the highest degree attractive, and in the hope of gaining the notice of the King, bent his way towards the seat of honors, full of agreeable anticipations. After the manner of the heroes of good old fairy lore, he travelled, and travelled, and travelled, until at length, in due time, he arrived at the court of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] puissant monarch, who is said to have had little discretion and no valor; and of whom all our readers have had a full and true account in romance, if not history. Here he fell into the ranks of expectancy, and continued a long time attending the motions of the court with unwearied diligence and inexhaustible patience, without having had the supreme felicity of being spoken to, or in any way noticed by his Majesty or his minions. By this time both his money and his wardrobe became nearly exhausted, and he was seriously meditating the alternative of entering into foreign service, or adopting the expedient of Prince Hal and his roystering companions. But those who wait patiently the ebbing of the tide are sure to float on the flood at last. And chance afforded what he could not obtain by seeking. Pacing one day in the antichamber of the King, his Majesty---who since the Gunpowder Plot had become even more nervous than after the Gowrie conspiracy--- being alone in his closet, chancing to hear a sound which caused him to turn suddenly round, was so grievously alarmed at seeing the reflection of his royal person in a large mirror, that he mistook it for an assassin, and cried out for help most lustily. Master Tyringham, then under the lucky star, happened to be the first who ran to the rescue, which he did, sword in hand; and having through an unerring instinct acquired by long residence at court, penetrated the whole affair, stoutly asserted on this, as well as all other occasions, that, on entering the closet, he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] distinctly seen a person with a dagger vanishing through an opposite door. This spirited exertion in behalf of the life and honor of his sovereign, was not without its immediate fruits. He was taken into special favor, and might in time have supplanted Steeney, if the King had dared to displace that formidable minion. His Majesty was content for the present to bestow on him the high responsible office of Gentleman Sewer, whose vocation it was to change the king's plate, and see that he did not wait for that important ceremony. What rendered this promotion the more honorable was, the fact that it had been bestowed in opposition to the entire Scottish influence at court, which was rallied in behalf of a nobleman of that country whose ancestors had become illustrious from having been one hundred and sixteen times in arms against their lawful sovereign. Master Basil Tyringham was thenceforward considered a rising man at court. His personal comeliness and accomplishments, added to his high position of Sewer, in due time attracted the notice, and finally secured the hand of one of the Maids of Honor, who was even more in favor with the Queen than he was with the King, whose secret he kept inviolable. The lady was of course noble, and could trace her lineage as high as Catharine Swineford, and Joan Hill, though it must be confessed, she valued herself much more on her paternal than maternal descent. However this may be, a marriage took place, and though neither could boast of much actual wealth, they calculated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] with certainty on the bounty of the King, who was excessively liberal of the money of his people. Nor were they disappointed, for on the death of that monarch, they retired at a respectable middle age, to a competent estate in the country, graced by a title. As might be supposed from his Norman extraction, which had long since been certified by Lyon King-at-arms, Lord Tyringham was exceedingly loyal---first, on the score of descent; secondly, in virtue of the high office he had held; and thirdly, for the special reason that the King is the fountain of all honors and profits. The wise old gentleman at our elbow says he has invariably observed that the most rampant loyalists will surely be found among the tribe of petty officials. The issue of this union, were two sons and a daughter. The destiny of the eldest son was of course settled, by the right of primogeniture; that of the younger was equally certain; and the daughter was specially brought up in the conviction that her first duty was to practice "moral restraint," and marry for an establishment, in conformity to a long enduring and purely aristocratic custom, which hath descended to the present time. Hastening over this portion of our story, it is only necessary to state that Hugh, the aforesaid younger son, being predestined by Magna Charter to become a national pauper, as his father had been before him, was shortly after coming home from college, like him sent forth to carve his way through life, under the guidance of that Providence which is said to take especial care of younger brothers. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] The troubles of Charles the First's reign had now approached a crisis, and Hugh Tyringham, having not only a loyal father, but a loyal alma mater , proceeded to London, where, through means of a college acquaintance, he was received among that band of young men equally loyal and wild, which had been drawn about the palace of Whitehall, under color of protecting the King, but in reality, as was surmised, for the purpose of overcoming the Parliament. Here he led rather a disorderly life, frequenting ordinaries and theatres; gambling when he had money; paying his devoirs to tradesmen's wives, and quizzing the Roundheads whenever opportunity offered. The band consisted principally of younger brothers, of ancient families, victims to the first-born of Egypt who naturally fell into a state of abject dependence on the patronage of the King, and became the servile instruments of power. It is these who principally compose the officers of European armies, and who, under the respectable name of loyalty to the King, become the most inexorable oppressors of the people. When this association of young sparks at Whitehall was broken up by the jealousy of Parliament, and hostilities had actually commenced, Hugh joined a troop of horse in the service of the King, and fought manfully in his cause, until Old Ironsides, and his valiant psalm singers, after stripping him of his crown, bereft him of the head that wore it. By the result of the contest his family was temporarily exiled, and himself left not only entirely destitute, but his person [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] placed in jeopardy. He was fain to secrete himself in the great wilderness of London, where, under the pressure of that iron necessity which is the only poor excuse for actions otherwise inexcusable, he lived in a manner not altogether reputable in the eyes of those who are free from similar temptations. Still he preserved the stamina of a gentleman; and though in some measure fallen, never descended so low as to be quite irreclaimable. He still retained a distinct sense of integrity and honor, and despised himself for what rendered him despicable in the eyes of others. Above all, he preserved his free and generous spirit in the midst of every temptation, and his good qualities still predominated over the exigencies of his situation. Though soiled, he was not past washing. The stain was not indelible. When Oliver Cromwell assumed the Protectorship, many Cavaliers, despairing of the restoration of the Stuarts, and perhaps apprehensive for their own safety, turned their eyes towards Virginia. Among them was Master Hugh Tyringham, now equally destitute of fruition and hope. He applied to his brother, who had taken refuge in Holland, and from him received a remittance, which barely enabled him to fit himself out, and pay his passage to the New World. In this adventure he was accompanied by a faithful follower, who had attached himself to his fortunes in early youth, and never deserted him in their lowest depression, either from real liking, or because he did not know how to better his fortune. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] Gregory Moth, as he was called, had accompanied his master to Oxford, and acquired a smattering of scholarship, at least so far as words went, as well as of the fables, traditions, and antiquities of that ancient seminary. He was moreover a great wag in his way, though of infinite gravity---a tipler upon occasion, and a coward always. He was for ever anticipating danger, that he might have an excuse for being frightened without reason. Though he trembled at the very idea of crossing the ocean, and had an insurmountable antipathy to the "Salvages," as Captain John Smith calls them, he was so attached to his master, either from habit or inclination, that he finally made up his mind to accompany him. Accordingly, they commenced the voyage together, and after the usual long passage of those days, at length launched on the capital of Virginia, as helpless a pair of adventurers as ever set foot on the virgin soil of the new world. Tyringham however soon encountered, and was welcomed by one two of his associates in the civil wars who had preceded him, and introduced to some of the old settlers. Being of a fine person, genteel address, and frank, generous spirit, it was not long ere he captivated the affections of the heiress of a goodly plantation, a discreet, sober, and excellent widow, not very young, or very accomplished, but of gentle disposition and great good sense. In the dearth of females which then pervaded the colony, this lady had often been wooed but never won, until Master Hugh Tyringham, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] according to the phraseology of a lady of color in the family, "melted the ice of her yellow-baster heart." With this excellent lady, he retired to the country, to the cultivation of rural tastes and tobacco. He succeeded rather better in the latter than the former; and though liberal somewhat beyond prudence, found himself waxing richer every revolving year. The first question was what to do with his money, and after due consideration, he as usual determined to consult Gregory on the subject, who had long since become his oracle. Accordingly, one pleasant evening as Master Tyringham was sitting, in the philosophic enjoyment of the "fragrant weed," on his rustic piazza, and Gregory, in order to recognize the degree of precedence between himself and his master, on the lowest step.--- "Moth," said the old cavalier---for he by this time was not young---"Moth," repeated he, puffing out a cloud of smoke, "what think you of my building a new house." He then chuckled a little, and said partly to himself, "I wonder what my lord brother would say if he found me living in a log palace. Moth, why the plague don't you speak?" "Master," quoth Gregory, "you know I never speak without due consideration. I was reflecting on the matter, and see but one objection." "Hey---what is that?" "Why, sir, there is an old proverb in the way." "Hey---what is that, Moth?" "Why, sir, that fools build houses, and wise men live in them." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] "Pish! what care I for such musty old saws. Did not King Solomon build him a magnificent house, and send all the way to Lebanon for the timber?" "Yea," quoth Gregory, "but I never heard that Solomon was held the wiser for it, any more than for having so many wives and concubines. But there is great wisdom in old sayings, master; they are, as it were, a part of the common law, inasmuch as the memory of men runneth not beyond them." "Pooh! Knowest thou not, Gregory, that what is called long-established truth, is often nothing more than grey-beard falsehood consecrated by time? But a truce with your proverbs. I say I am resolved to build a new house." "Well then, master of mine, I see no use in asking my opinion." "But I want your opinion as to what kind of a house it shall be. I suppose you can give me that." "O, if that's the object, sir; well, you know there are divers sorts of houses, to wit, the aulae lapidae, the aulae plombeae; the aulae vitrae; the aulae cum camino; and the aulae cum stramine cooperate--- whereof the first is of stone, the second of lead, the third of glass, the fourth hath a chimney, and the fifth is thatched with straw. You can take your choice, sir." "But I want your opinion, I tell you." "Well, sir, if I were in your place, I would not build a stone house, because there is no stone within fifty miles---nor a leaden house, because the first [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] Indian war that happens, it would be run into bullets--- nor a glass house, because there are things occur in all houses that ought not to be seen by everybody--- nor a house with a chimney, because two are much better---lastly, sir, I would by no means have you build a straw house, inasmuch as you are continually stumbling over single straws, and would certainly break your nose over a straw house." "Moth; do you know I've a great mind to send you on the expedition fitting out against the Indians. They are in great want of men, and you will be a host. If I can't get anything out of you, the colony may." This insinuation acted instantaneously on the nerves of Master Gregory, who exclaimed in a paroxysm of fear---"For Heaven's sake, master, what put that in your head? What have I said or done that you should condemn me to be roasted alive, as I certainly shall be if I go out against the pagan salvages. What was it you wished to get out of me, sir?" "Why your opinion about the house, confound you. I don't want to know what house I ought not to build, but what will be best." "O, is that all? Why then I should advise you, sir, to build a wooden house, because there is plenty of timber near at hand, and your new saw mill will supply boards." "Gregory," quoth Mr. Tyringham, "you're a perfect oracle. The house shall be of wood, I am determined, and now I will go and consult Mistress [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] Tyringham." He did so, and as that good lady never opposed him, when he was in the right---an example earnestly recommended to all discreet wives --- the wooden house was commenced on a great scale for the new world and finished in due time, to the satisfaction of all concerned. The building of the house was followed by the birth of a son, who was fast verging to manhood, and in his own opinion already a man, at the period when Harold Habingdon took possession of the adjoining plantation. Having thus brought the Cavalier and the Roundhead together, we shall proceed straightforward in our journey, without once looking behind. Seldom have two men been brought together into close contact with more points of dissimilarity than Harold Harbingdon and Hugh Tyringham; and though the latter with the spontaneous generosity that marked his character had tendered the new comer his house, his advice, and his services, it was next to impossible, considering the bitter prejudices subsisting between the Cavaliers and Roundheads which were as yet unmitigated by time, that they should ever become friends. Both religion and politics forbade; and though oil and vinegar are found to mingle together harmoniously in the latter, yet has it unhappily been but too often demonstrated that religious antipathies, like those of nature, are seldom reconciled. The stern and self-sufficient pride of human opinion seems more inflexible here than elsewhere, and that which teaches humility becomes a source of arrogant intolerance. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] To do the two gentlemen justice, they did not fall out at the first encounter, nor during the brief sojourn of Harold with the gay Cavalier, who made it a part of his creed never to affront a guest, even though he refused to pledge him in a bumper. Yet it cannot be denied, that a solid foundation was laid at this early period for a long series of suffering to those they loved best on earth. Tyringham was the embodiment of a sentiment which seems almost extinct at the present time, when the feeling of loyalty to kings, which was rather a slavish principle, has been almost superseded by the more enlarged and manly one of patriotism. Harold---doubtless stimulated by the plebeian blood that contaminated his veins---on the contrary was a republican. One was high church; the other abhorred the prelacy, and was, in truth, as much of a democrat in religion as politics. Without entering into more minute chemical antipathies, it will readily be seen that here were fruitful sources of discussion on points which almost invariably end in contention and dislike. As almost every man has an opinion of his own, it is a great pity he is not willing to allow the like privilege to others. Still, however, the two neighbors being the only settlers within a distance of several miles, continued for some time to hold a lazy, indifferent sort of intercourse with each other, and to exchange the offices of good neighborhood. The only son of the Cavalier and the only daughter of the Puritan were thus occasionally brought together, but to all appearance took [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] no special note of each other. There was not much difference in their ages, but a total dissimilarity of disposition. Miriam Habingdon resembled her father in the staid sobriety of his outward deportment, as well as in the deep fervor of his inward feelings, and her mother in her plaintive voice and gentle bearing. She was naturally full of poetic feeling; but both the precepts and example of her father had taught her to limit her enthusiasm to piety alone. For aught that appeared otherwise, all her feelings were concentrated in filial duty and profound devotion. Her reading had been almost entirely confined to the Bible and books of a serious cast; and her language had acquired much of that apostolic simplicity which would indeed seem inspiration, since it baffles all attempts at imitation. Like her mother, her appearance was not striking at first; but the oftener she was seen the more she gained on the eye and the heart, even of those who were in some measure steeled by long cherished prejudices. Her approaches were slow but sure; like the bee, she gathered her honey almost imperceptibly, and what she gained, she scarcely ever lost. Her voice has already been commemorated, and was so musical that good nurse Mildred solemnly declared that she had rather listen to it than to a sermon; and Gregory Moth, though he always called her the Crop-ear young lady, more than once assured Master Langley Tyringham, that were he buried under the Polar Sea, the very sound of her voice would melt him, even as a Virginia dog-day. Miriam too had wit; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] it was a melancholy wit, which is said to be far more dangerous than a merry one. Master Langley Tyringham, though not quite of age, and an only child, was yet a man in thought, hardihood and daring. Though brought up in the woods, he was not to be scared by an owl; and though no great scholar, his faculties had been awakened, schooled and matured, by dangers and vicissitudes. From his first breath of life, he had been surrounded by savages, whose friendship was as precarious as their enmity was active and terrible. His father lived at the very outskirts of civilization, and was obliged to be his own protector as well as avenger. In his very childhood he had once been seized by an Indian while playing on the verge of a wood near the house, who was making off with him, when he was shot by the father, and instantly killed. Tradition says that the stout little fellow neither shed a tear or uttered a cry on this occasion, but kicked, scratched and struggled manfully. He handled the rifle like a backwoodsman; guided his boat on the river with the dexterity of an Indian; tracked the wild deer with the instinct of a hound; and took the lead on all occasions in those rural sports which at this period were accompanied by perpetual exposures and dangers. Though not accomplished according to the acceptation of this age, he was by no means ignorant or unlettered. He had for his instructor Gregory Moth, who boasted of being an Oxford scholar, and who had indeed managed to scrape together, by hook or by crook, from that vast [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] pile of accumulated learning, where so many bring contributions and carry nothing away, a modicum of scholarship that might almost pass muster at a college examination. His father, also, who, when he brushed off a little of the rust of time, was by no means deficient in general intelligence, paid no little attention to his progress in learning. Though of a figure like that of Apollo, or an Indian, he would not have made a very brilliant debut at a modern fashionable assemblage; but in all those qualities, moral, intellectual, and physical, which give one man superiority over another in the stern and trying warfare of the world, and in times of suffering or danger make him the master of his fellows, our hero---for such he is---was liberally gifted. In short, he was the very man for a new world and a free country. The gentle and courteous reader, who hath doubtless had his perceptions brought to so fine an edge by a constant study of cheap literature, that he can smell a rat where there is not a mouse stirring, will assuredly have anticipated our future disclosures by pronouncing at once that the two young persons, just sketched, are, long before this time, in love to distraction, and that the secret is just about being formally disclosed. But he is quite out in his reckoning, and had better be quiet until he knows what he is talking about. The two young people are not in love with each other, nor shall they be until it is our good pleasure to make them so. It is a sin and a shame that an author cannot be allowed to keep his own secrets till he sees [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] proper to disclose them, and that some prying, disagreeable reader---not one of ours, of course---will always be putting in his oar, and plumping the boat high and dry ashore, when, in fact, the pains-taking author is not yet half through the voyage, thus bringing his work to an untimely end, by satiating the reader's appetite before he has half finished his dinner. We hereby pledge ourselves that this young couple did not fall in love at first, or second, sight. Miriam shrunk from the high spirits and frank deportment of Langley, while he felt chilled, if not repelled, by what he considered the stiff, cold, and distant reception he always received from Miriam. It was ten to one they would soon dislike each other heartily, unless some unexpected obstacle presented itself to their intercourse; for as the thunderstorm approaches apparently against the wind, so do the passions of the human race strengthen by opposition, and expend themselves with greater force when that opposition is overcome. In the meantime, the coolness between the Cavalier and the Roundhead gradually approached the freezing point. It was not as yet exhibited in any sudden outbreak of spleen, or exemplified by any overt act. It matured by degrees, and became more inflexible, as well as lasting, from the slowness of its growth. It was not active hatred, but passive, inveterate dislike. There was not only conflicting opinions and prejudices, but opposite habits to encounter; and these last are by far the most difficult to reconcile. The stiff sobriety, colloquial precision, and staid abstinence of Harold, ill [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] suited with the frank speech and manners, or the convivial habits of the Cavalier, who swore he could never elevate the Crop-ear one degree above zero, and who cherished a sovereign contempt for a fellow who had so little of the spirit of good-fellowship in him, that he would not drink a glass of wine with a friend, even against his conscience. Two events happened about this period, which contributed to bring about a non-intercourse between the two neighbors. In a little skirmish that took place at an accidental meeting, on the subject of the Prelacy, Harold had roundly asserted that the mitre of the bishops was a Pagan device, borrowed from the highpriest of ancient Rome. The Cavalier, who, it must be acknowledged, was more zealous than pious, took fire at this attack on the hierarchy, and covenanted with himself that he would cut the Crop-ear out and out, from that time forward. But the holidays were now approaching, and softened by the benign and jolly influence of that beneficent saint who presides over the season of good wishes, good things, and good fellowship, the Cavalier sent Harold a frank, cordial invitation to meet a few friends from the capital at a Christmas dinner. The invitation was promptly declined, with the additional offence of a slur on Christmas festivities, which, being of Pagan origin, Harold denounced as unworthy of Christians. This was not very polite; but zeal often gets the better of good manners. The Cavalier was a great lover of holidays, which, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] he maintained, were invented on purpose to afford occasional opportunities for the poor to eat, drink, and be merry. Especially did he delight in the hilarity of the little children on these occasions, and the obstreperous jollity of his colored dependents, who managed to crowd into a small compass as much enjoyment as would sprinkle a whole life of those whose sole employment is hunting it throughout the world. Neither did he like holidays the less, that they gave him a fair opportunity of indulging his own convivial propensities, by gathering a few of his old cronies about him from the capital, and feasting them royally. He was therefore highly indignant at Harold's refusal, and especially resented his reflections on the venerable Christmas holidays. As he complained that he never could stimulate his wife to sympathize in his extempore bursts of indignation, it was his custom on all such occasions to summon Gregory Moth, who, either from long and faithful services, or through the influence which the air of the new world seems to exercise over all those who breathe it for any length of time, had of late been admitted to a reasonable degree of equality, and aspired to that freedom of speech which is held the birthright of Americans. "Plague take that impenetrable Roundhead," said Master Tyringham, to Gregory, who was seldom far from his master; "he will neither eat, drink, or be merry; and what is such a man good for, I should like to know. It will take ten summers in Virginia [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] to thaw him. What shall I do with the fellow? Call him out---hey?" "Sir Master," quoth Gregory, "logically speaking, before I undertake to advise you what to do, it is manifestly expedient for me to know what has been done unto you." "Why the psalm-singing curmudgeon has not only refused to dine with me at Christmas, but insists that keeping Christmas is a Pagan custom altogether unseemly in Christians. What think you of such a fellow---eh?" "Why, sir, logically speaking---" "O confound your logic. If you will speak, say something to the purpose." "Well, sir, syllogistically speaking---" "'Slife, Gregory, what has a Roundhead to do with syllogisms. I want your advice as to how I shall manage this two-legged cabbage, who, I verily believe, vegetates against his conscience." "Well, sir, how can I give my opinion of a single individual without first defining the species? And how can I define the species except logically or syllogistically? You might as well judge of a goose by its feathers." "Well---well---I know you are an obstinate ass, with ears only the longer from having brayed against the outside of a college. You make as great a display of your shreds and patches as others do of a whole suit. But proceed, either logically or syllogistically, just as you please; and as I perceive very clearly you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] are going to make a speech as long as a Roundhead's prayer, I will light my pipe and take a seat under this tree. Proceed, sir." "Well, sir," replied the other, taking his seat on the green sward, "in order to define what man really is, it is proper and right, nay, absolutely necessary, that we should go to the fountain-head. I will therefore, begin with Adam." "The Devil you will!" cried Master Tyringham, taking the pipe from his mouth, and puffing out a cloud of smoke---pfew! "But pray proceed, Master Gregory, with your infernal logic." "Infernal logic, sir? Why, Master, the excellence of logic is such as cannot be expressed in words, conveyed by signs, or embodied in thought. It is a net that no man can escape, a cobweb from which no fly can disentangle himself. It muzzles the mouth of ignorance, silences the chattering of fancy, and chokes a wild boar---" "Chokes a wild boar?" exclaimed Master Tyringham. "How do you make that out, Gregory?" "As thus, sir, logically. It is authentically delivered by tradition, which being the father of history, is therefore more venerable and infallible, that a scholar of Oxford, in days when wild boars came to college, I don't mean, sir, that they studied, or took their degrees, as A. B., A. M., LL.D., and such like, but when they prowled about, shortly after King Brute and his valiant Trojans laid the foundation of the first college at Oxford." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] "Well, get on with your story, and have done with these old greybeard tales." "As I was saying, sir, a scholar of Oxford, having retired to a neighboring forest to pursue his studies, was surprised and sorely beleaguered by a huge wild boar, the which he finally utterly discomfited by thrusting a volume of Aristotle down his throat, which choked him incontinently." "Faith, Gregory, I don't wonder at it. I was nearly choked in the same way myself. But to the point. I desire to know what I am to do with the Roundhead." "Very well, Master, to proceed logically, though I don't hold it absolutely necessary, yet it appears to me quite indispensable---" "Hem," quoth Mr. Tyringham. "That we should go a little beyond Adam, whereby we shall be the better able to tell what man is, by defining what he is not, for, as Aristotle says, your negatives are sometimes more potent than your affirmatives, especially when they hunt in couples. If you please then, sir, we will begin at the creation of the world." Here Master Tyringham leaned back against the tree, and shut his eyes, probably that he might see the clearer into Gregory's logic. "I remember, sir," continued Master Moth, "there was in our time a great dispute concerning the question whether or not the world ever had a beginning, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] and that one learned professor lost his wits in seeking a solution. But however that may be---" Here Gregory observed his master beginning to nod, and that his pipe was very near scorching the flaps of his waistcoat, whereupon he essayed to wake him by crying out, in a loud voice, "For my part, sir, I have a sort of disagreeing consent to this theory, and think I can see in the perspicuous cloud of human reason a clear way to get into insurmountable difficulty by striving to get out of it. I will therefore whisper in a loud voice and be silent, in order that I may penetrate the deep shallowness of my hearer." "What's that you are saying?" quoth Master Tyringham, rubbing his eyes. "Deep shallowness---how can that be, you blockhead? It is downright contradiction--- a logical paradox." "By your leave, sir," answered Gregory, "there is nothing so apposite to the illustration of a logical truth, as direct opposites, whereby we the more clearly discern the exact likeness of a thing by seeing something as unlike it as possible: just as we become the more sensible of the presence of ghosts by their being invisible." "Very well---that will do, Gregory," said his master, interrupting him, "I understand a Roundhead perfectly. Please to take the boat and catch a sturgeon for dinner. You will doubtless succeed best among the deep shallows of the river." Gregory departed well pleased that he had indulged his humor, and what, indeed, was his principal object [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] in all such discussions, gained time for his master's choler to evaporate, which it did very soon, for though quick to anger, like his own trusty rifle, he cooled immediately, the moment he had discharged his load. The Cavalier called for his horse, and proceeded, as was his daily custom, on a tour of inspection over his plantation, which was some miles about. For this he had two very rational objects; the first to see how matters were going on with the tobacco; the second to get an appetite for dinner, which, however it may be despised by sentimentalists, is by no means to be contemned by philosophers. He who cannot relish his dinner, can scarcely relish anything else; and the man who can enjoy his meals and sleep soundly at night, must not only possess good health, but be blessed with a clear conscience---or none at all. As usual in these peregrinations, he encountered his overseer, with whom he consulted, and to whom he gave his advice on various matters, about which he knew little or nothing. The overseer informed him, among other things, he had that morning heard a rumor that the Roanoke Indians---a tribe once reputed to speak Welsh, were meditating an incursion towards Powhatan River, and advised the necessary precautions to guard against surprise. These Indians had not long ago smoked the Calumet with the Governor; but mutual suspicions, mutual apprehensions, mutual aggressions, and long cherished recollections of past injuries, rendered it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to maintain a lasting good understanding between the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] Redman and the white. At this distant period of time, it is useless to inquire, and perhaps impossible to ascertain in all cases, which was to blame, or which most to be blamed. Both parties feared each other, and fear is the parent of hatred. In this, as in many other cases, a looker-on is not the best judge. He may see, but cannot feel the most; and to decide this question, the umpire should be placed in the same situation with the early pioneers of the new world. It is not to be settled in the peaceful chimney corner, by pious old ladies, or universal philanthropists. On his way home, the Cavalier, forgetting his late affront, called on Harold, to give him warning that he might be prepared for what should happen. But that gentleman, having not yet realized the obligations imposed on him by his new situation, and the absolute necessity that any man should become not only his own defender, but the protector of others, talked about the abstract principles of justice; and losing sight of the great law of self-defence, declined to take any measures for that purpose, as it went against his conscience. He had never injured the savages, nor had they ever injured him, and he relied on Providence alone for protection. "Master Habingdon," said Tyringham, with emphatic seriousness, "I am a magistrate, and it is my duty to see the laws executed, most especially those necessary to the safety of life and property. Among these is one which makes it incumbent on every male member of the community, not disqualified by age or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] infancy to bear arms, and be ready at a moment's warning, to defend himself and protect others. Now, sir, however contrary it may be to my feelings as a neighbor, I am bound by my oath of office, to see that all do their utmost in time of danger, and I shall be obliged to enforce the law against you, in the event of an inroad of the savages. Until then, I will shut my eyes and say nothing, in hopes that you will think better of it." "Master Tyringham," replied Harold, stiffly, "I always act from principle, leaving it to Providence to shape the consequences. From all I can learn, these wild men of the woods have been treated harshly and unjustly, and if we suffer for it, I conceive it is only a salutary atonement. I should scruple to shed blood in a cause like this." "After shedding it in the cause of rebellion, sir"--- said the other, "I should suppose you might be less scrupulous. The man who has drawn his sword against his king, need not shrink from employing it against his enemies." "Master Tyringham, you and I differ so widely on this subject, that argument is useless. You are under my roof, sir, and came here on a friendly errand. I cannot forget what I owe you as a guest, and I expect you to remember what is due to me as your host." The blood of the Cavalier was roused, and that of Harold, with all his self-command, tingled in his veins, for the slur of rebellion against a cause he still held sacred, was a bitter pill. Many keen passes took [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] place between them, and they parted worse friends than they met. The old Cavalier had scarcely issued from the premises of the Roundhead, when he met young Master Langley, riding that way, as if intending a visit, and somewhat testily desired him to turn to the right about and go with him. As they proceeded homewards, he repeated what he had heard concerning the savages, and being too impatient to enter on the particulars of his interview with Harold, abruptly desired him, in a tone not to be misunderstood, to desist in future from all intercourse with a person who had bore arms against his lawful sovereign, yet scrupled to do so in defence of his wife, his family, his neighbors and his country. Now be it known, that Langley Tyringham cared not a rush for the family of the Roundheads, male or female, and cherished a positive antipathy to old Mildred, who had divers times put herself in his way and attempted to convert him. He particularly disliked the stiff, starched manners of Harold; knew little of his wife whom he seldom saw; and, though sometimes struck with the eloquent simplicity of Miriam's words, the gentle melody of her voice, and the harmony of her face and person, never failed in the end to be repelled by the staid, sober gravity of her manners. If left to himself, or if accident had decreed they should meet no more, it is probable he might never have thought of her again. As it was, he bowed in submission to the will of his father, deciding at the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] same time in his own mind, that the good gentleman was a little unreasonable. When alone he recurred to the subject again, and after long cogitation as to what special reason his father had to establish this system of non-intercourse, at length came to the conclusion that he was under serious apprehension, that himself and Miriam either had, or were about to fall in love with each other. There was something most mischievously titillating in the idea and its consequences; he thought a good deal about it that night, fell asleep, and for the first time in his life dreamed of Miriam. Rights of Authors---Wisdom of Gregory Moth---The Author Reminded of One of his Heroines---Something that May peradventure Give Offence to Nine-tenths of Our Readers---Little Miriam Habingdon Hunts up an Excitement---An Accidental Meeting---A Parting--- Langley Tyringham Calls Names. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] Every writer of a romance has an undoubted right to tell his own story, in his own way, at his own peril. Some gallop, some trot, some creep along like a snail with his house on his back, and some stop so often by the road-side, that the gentle reader is out of all patience. Some are in such a violent hurry that they crowd the incidents pell-mell together in most inextricable disorder, without connexion or explanation; others are so careful in preparing the way for what follows, that the reader forgets what went before, and anticipates what is coming after, very often with more certainty than the author. Some are of such ineffable modesty that they never venture to appear in their own proper persons, except, perhaps, in the title page or preface; while others are so fond of hearing themselves talk, that they are very apt to prose the reader to sleep. Some seem to think that a rapid, unceasing succession of incident is indispensable to keep the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] reader awake; while others, on the contrary, consider their own thoughts so much better than the actions of other people, that they are perpetually intruding their individual tastes, opinions, and feelings, forgetting that the generality of mankind are so egotistical themselves, that they can't endure the egotism of others. Action, or incident, is undoubtedly one of the main props of fictitious narrative, and hence every writer of romance should pay special attention to that point. If he finds his fancy, invention, or memory deficient, in this indispensable material, he must then resort to talking, and set his actors to making long speeches, or he must become philosophical and aspire to the dignity of teaching. It sometimes doubtless happens, that the author has plenty of incidents on hand, but is at a loss for motives strong enough to render events sufficiently probable. There is but one remedy for this. He must give actions without motives, whereby he will greatly astonish the reader, and produce an agreeable excitement. The most deplorable case, however, is when an author has ploughed the fertile bog of his understanding, till it has become a perfect pine barren, in which the principle of vegetation is entirely extinct. Nothing is then left him but to make the most of nothing. He must loiter along like a school-boy, anon chasing butterflies, and next skipping stones in every puddle by the way. Whenever he introduces a personage, he should be very particular in giving the precise hour, or minute of his appearance; be sure to apprise the reader what kind of a day or night it is, and whether [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] the moon shines. Most important of all, he should describe the gentleman's dress to the very button, and by no means ever send him on a visit to his mistress without apprising the reader whether or not he had been previously shaved. If the debutant is a lady, he should be, if possible, still more particular, and enact the man-milliner to the utmost extent of his genius, which, if deficient in this important particular, should by all means be refreshed by an application to some competent authority among the French milliners. It is indispensable that he should individualize, and not omit a single item, except such as claim the privilege of invisibility. In short, he should take pattern after the London scribes who chronicle the stupendous events of a birthnight ball, and tell us to a penny the value of a lady's jewels. By these, and other adroit expedients---of which the present discussion may serve as a specimen--- it is amazing (we speak from experience) with what ease a couple of volumes of cheap literature may be spun out of an exceedingly small modicum of the raw material, and how much wear and tear is saved to a weather-beaten fancy. But we will say no more, least the intelligent reader should suspect us of seeking to appear wiser than himself, a degree of presumption we utterly disclaim. Our sole object has been to throw out a few hints for the benefit of the rising generation, gleaned in the course of a long experience in the mysteries of authorship. Having done this, we will take up the clue of our story, if we can find it again. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] The Cavalier, as previously hinted, returned home in great dudgeon, and, according to custom, summoned Gregory to a cabinet council on the subject of the reported movement of the savages. He accounted that trusty knave the best of all counsellors, since he was accustomed to boast that he had an instinct apprising him of any coming danger, which he could foretell with as much certainty as an almanac does the weather. "Come hither, sirrah," said Master Tyringham, "you are a notorious poltroon, and they say cowardice is sometimes inspired with good counsel. I hear the savages are preparing to fall upon us." "You call me coward, sir," answered Gregory, "but say what you will, there is not a more valiant man in the colony, so long as danger keeps at a distance." "And you take special care always to keep it so, for you never fail to run away before it comes in sight." "Just so, sir,---that is to say, before it becomes visible to vulgar eyes. I have a sort of second sight of danger, and always flee before the shadow, because I know the substance cannot be far off. I am not, I thank the sign that governed my nativity---to wit, the crab that feeds by moonlight---one of those stupid people, who, not seeing danger till it is too late to escape, are compelled to fight in spite of their teeth, and then desperation passes for valor." "Good-now will you, who understand the subject [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] so thoroughly, define a man of courage, according to your system of logic?" "Why, sir, your true courageous Philistine---" "Gregory, don't repeat that infernal word again; it is perpetually in the mouth of that canting Roundhead yonder, who has scruples of conscience in fighting against any one but the King and the Church. Do you know he just now as much as called me a Philistine, and talked of repelling the savages with praying and psalm-singing. Instead of Philistines say Moabites." "Or Hittites, if your worship pleases. But touching the logical definition, sir, your only true man of valor is he who holds danger in such sovereign contempt that he incontinently turns his back on it; or, what is still more incontestible demonstration of heroism, is so little afraid of death that he makes no resistance, and dies quietly like a true philosopher. A murrain take those dastardly bullies who are forever fighting through pure fear of being called cowards. For my part, I am not afraid of that name---not I---and if I keep myself out of harm's way, it is only for fear I should cry out before I am hurt. Others may die from sheer cowardice, but, for my part, I am not afraid to live." "'Slife, Gregory, you are the first fool I ever met with that took such pains to prove himself a coward." "Coward, sir! didn't I follow you to the wars, and courageously eschew all danger, in spite of the floutings of those pestilent knaves, that fought only that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] they were afraid to run away, because they feared dishonor more than death? A man like me has some right to boast, when he can set his face manfully against all the world and despise its ridicule. Is not this a greater proof of valor than to face a single enemy? You forget, sir, that I saved the whole royal army by crying out one night that the Crop-ears were upon them, whereby they were the better prepared for their coming next morning." "Why, friend Gregory, you have mistaken your vocation, and were certainly intended for a senior wrangler. I predict to a certainty you will one day meet death in the teeth by running away from him." "With your permission, sir, I'd rather it were in the night, for I should not like to die in my own presence, and see myself after I was dead." "Well---well---I confess you to be as courageous as a hen partridge protecting her young. But enough of this. I wished to consult your apprehensive cowardice concerning the probability of this rumor. What think you, will the caitiffs come?" "Beyond question, Master---I feel it in my bones; they always ache before a basting, and my short ribs have lately troubled me sorely. Besides I have a strange tingling sensation about my head, which causes my hair to stand on end of late, and I think betokens its loss ere long." "Will you never be serious, thou incorrigible buffoon? Is this a time to be jesting; and would you think it a laughing matter if the savages were to come [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] in the middle of the night and wake us up with the yell of death, never to sleep again except in the arms of death? Or what is still worse, think of their carrying us away captive, not to spare our lives, but to make death a thousand times more lingering, agonizing and terrible. I think I see at this moment our bleeding scalps torn from our heads, reeking with blood; our skins bristling with sharp pine knots, smoking and blazing like lighted torches; our heads left naked to the brain, covered with live coals; our legs up to the knees in burning embers, and our bodies expiring in agonies beyond the reach of thought, or the utterance of the tongue. This is no theme for jesting or laughter. Before to-morrow morning we may have a chorus of dying groans and shrieks of anguish." But never man was farther from laughing than Gregory Moth at this moment. The appalling picture presented by his master had stirred him up to an agony of terror. He was on his knees, his eyes wildly glaring around, his limbs trembling, his teeth chattering, and his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth. His master contemplated him with a sort of scornful pity, and when he had somewhat recovered, said: "Well, sir, are you now prepared to give your advice seriously?" "Ye---e---e---s, sir," replied Gregory, trembling, "Ye---e---s, sir. My advice is to make the best of our way to the capital, without once looking behind, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] depart thence in the first ship for Old England, where these are none of these copper-colored villains." "What! leave my home to be burnt, my estate to be plundered, and return to England a beggar, as I left it? No---no, Gregory, those who look for independence and fortune here must fight for it. So let me hear what else you have to propose. I know you are not such an ass as you affect to be, and can give good counsel when you please." Gregory rallied, and, after due consideration, delivered himself to this effect. He advised that information of the rumor should be sent to the capital, with a request for assistance; that the house of Master Tyringham should be put in as good a state of defence as possible; that none of the family should be permitted to stray from home; and that a watch should be set at night to give notice of danger." "Gregory," said his master, "I say and swear it--- you are an oracle. Though you yaw about like a ship without a rudder, you never fail to come safe into port at last. It is exactly what I had determined on before I asked your advice." "Hum," quoth Gregory, "I thought as much. My master never consults anybody until he has made up his mind to do as he pleases." Preparations were accordingly made in accordance with the advice of the sage Gregory. But it would seem, if people are to be caught at all, they are caught napping. Our friend, the wise old gentleman, observes on this occasion that it is better to make [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] preparation a hundred times against danger that never comes, than to be caught once unprepared when it arrives. The savages did not come this time. The rumor probably arose from those unceasing apprehensions which would have rendered a residence under such circumstances intolerable, were it not that perpetual danger is its own antidote. It is among the special mercies of Providence, that what mankind are condemned to endure without ceasing ceases by degrees to be unbearable; and that the burden which must be inevitably borne becomes lighter the longer it is carried. The calm which had for a time been ruffled by the rumor of Indian hostilities again returned; the every day business of life went on as before, and the good people became more confident that the danger was past, from their having been needlessly alarmed. But methinks we hear the gentle reader complaining that we have lately said nothing of the ladies, who most assuredly have the best right to figure in romance, because the greatest number of readers belong to the sex. "After cheating me," methinks I hear you say, "into a belief that Susan Baneswright was to be your heroine, and Harold Habingdon your hero, you drop the one entirely, and say little or nothing about the other. Is she dead? If so you might have said something civil about her. For aught I can see we are to have neither hero or heroine." Gentle reader! Susan is not dead. But what could we say of her worthy the dignity of romance? She has kept on the even tenor of her way, gently [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] revolving in the quiet circle of the domestic fireside, carefully fulfilling all those noble duties on which women are now taught, by mischievous discussions on their rights, to look down with contempt as degrading to the sex, but which contribute far more to their own happiness, and that of the entire human race, than all the equivocal virtues of an Elizabeth, or all the dangerous talents of a Corinne. It is not, quoth the wise old gentleman at our side, it is not by her efforts without doors, but within; it is not by winning public admiration, but by private acts, her unseen, but not unfelt agency; not by leading armies, subduing kingdoms, governing states, or mingling in the contaminating strife of manhood, but by instilling into the future man those virtues which prepare him for the performance of high achievements, and the exercise of great virtues, that woman best fulfils her divine mission. Surely it is enough that one-half the human race is compelled to delve in Mammon's mine, to smother or control the generous impulses of the heart, and become selfish in self-defence. In the name of virtue and humanity, let not the other half be engulphed in the vortex of this scuffling world, least it become a hell, and be peopled by fiends. The best praise of woman is never to be talked of by the world. Silence is her most eloquent eulogium; the approving thoughts of others her highest praise, and the suffrage of heaven her richest reward. So saith the old gentleman; but it must be confessed he is at least a hundred years behind the spirit of the age. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] As our first object in this work was to gain the approbation of the highest order of fashionable readers we had determined to avoid all low, common-place topics, and especially all such domestic concerns as exclusively appertain to the vulgar. But as the reader is determined to know something more of good Mistress Habingdon, he must be gratified at all hazards. Be it known, then, that Susan passed most of her time in plying her needle and knitting stockings. As an apology for these ignoble occupations, it should be recollected that at this period there were no men-milliners in the new world, and as for seamstresses and spinsters, professionally, nothing of the kind was ever heard of. Young women were too valuable to become hired menials, and a damsel of ordinary attractions was a prize for a first-rate planter. If not worth her weight in gold she was in tobacco. Yet it cannot be denied that the needle is an instrument of more value than the sword, the revolving pistol, or even the "Big Gun" of the conqueror of California, being most potent in keeping women out of mischief. How many heavy hours does it while away that would otherwise be spent in yawning lassitude, or exerted in the fruitless pursuit of some fleeting shadow that mocks her as it flies; and what a zest it gives to the hours of rest and relaxation, or to the employment of the mind in wholesome study, or quiet contemplation. A stitch in time not only saves nine, but kills time, while it excites a gentle interest, by carrying her who plies the needle to the end of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] seam. At least one half the errors and follies, not to say crimes, of the human race, quoth the wise old gentleman, originate in not knowing what to do with themselves. Excitement of some kind or other is indispensable, and those who don't find it in business must seek it in pleasure or mischief. Having run down one fancied pleasure, they soon become sated, and seek another more piquant and racy, until at length mere folly grows insipid, and excitement can only be allayed by guilty indulgence. It is matter of surprise that our lawyers don't urge this in extenuation of murder, instead of laying it to the temptations of the devil, or resorting to the old threadbare plea of insanity. But a great portion of these temptations may be avoided by the gentle sex if they will only resort to the needle, which is a sort of non-conductor to all sorts of mischief. As the lightning rod protects the house from the dread flashes of the angry cloud, so does the needle ward off the besetting sin of love, insomuch that it is an established truth that no woman can possibly thread her needle while thinking of her sweetheart. Well might the goddess of wisdom, continues the old gentleman, dispute with Arachne the superior management of the needle, [1] and change that notable damsel into a spider for excelling her in stitching, for it is most undoubtedly the greatest of all female accomplishments. Would I were a tailor! Not that Susan devoted herself exclusively to the needle. The spinning wheel was not then quite [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] obsolete, and often, yea, every day, though not all day long, would she and Miriam join in the harmonious concert of the spinning wheel. It was worth a trip to the Nile to see them, as they sat side by side, on a balmy spring morning, at an open window that looked out over a spacious greensward, dotted with trees, as old as the flood, on the wide expanse of the shining river. Dressed in the simple fashion of the sect, without ornaments of any kind, they might almost pass for sisters. Susan was one of those jewels of women that grow handsomer as they grow old, and though, as long ago stated, no beauty when young, had become one of the most comely of matrons. Miriam was the genuine representative of a very small class of females, that like a glorious landscape cannot be described, because no words can convey an idea of the expression of one, or the cunning dexterity of nature in combining the other. As the mother and daughter plied this most graceful of occupations, their appearance was touchingly attractive. The easy motions of the head and chest, keeping time with those of the little foot; one hand touching the light distaff, the other moving to and fro as it drew forth the slender thread and returned it again, all formed a picture fresh from the hand of nature, more graceful and alluring than all the grimaces and contortions of sickly affectation. Talk of the waltz, the polka and mazourka---pshaw! In those long delicious summer twilights, equally dear to the poetic as the contemplative mind, it was their custom to ramble along the shore of the river [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] whose silvery sands, washed by the salt waters of the not distant ocean, the hollow drumming of whose surf might sometimes be heard, afforded a pleasant promenade. On these occasions they were generally escorted by Harold, and sometimes, previous to the prohibition of the wrathful Cavalier, by Langley Tyringham, when he chanced to come that way. Their conversation was generally of a sober, pious cast, sometimes enlivened by the spritely or enthusiastic sallies of the youth, who, with all his active, vigorous habits of body, was of an imaginative mind. These, though they excited a smile in the face of Susan, and sometimes a thrill in the heart of Miriam, were received by Harold with a stiff, discouraging gravity, which, though not expressed in words, was sufficiently intelligible. Harold was a sincerely pious man. He loved his Maker, but did not seem to love His works; and when Langley and sometimes Miriam broke forth in admiration of the glories of the setting sun, or the silvery beauty of the rising moon, would check their innocent and happy feelings, by drawing contemptuous contrasts between the eternal omnipotence of the Creator, and the frail duration of all created things. He did not seem to comprehend the beautiful truth, that there is an inseparable connexion between the great Creator and His works, which are the Jacob's ladder by which, step by step, we ascend to the beneficent Architect of all these wonders. Where shall we look for a livelier type of infinite goodness, than in the beauties of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] nature, and the bounties of the generous earth? Where shall we look for a more striking exemplification of His mercy than in the rich gifts He has bestowed on wayward, ungrateful man? And where shall we find a greater proof of His omnipotence, than in contemplating the uncircumscribed infinitude of His glorious universe? It is greatly to be regretted---says the wise old genman aforesaid---that rigidly righteous persons do not sometimes condescend to make themselves agreeable to those who are not precisely so; that they clothe religion in sackcloth and ashes; war against the cheerful hilarity of youth, and the innocent recreations of manhood; and convert a smiling cherub into a scowling demon, looking askance at all that adorns and embellishes human existence. Thus is the balmy solace sent to cheer us onward through the thorny path of life converted into gall and bitterness; and the light intended to guide us to port, becomes not a beacon to the haven of rest, but to the iron-bound coast of gloom, despondency, and despair. It were much to be wished that piety would make herself more amiable to the young, instead of adopting that species of monkish austerity, by which the anchorites of old sought to starve their way to heaven, by rejecting the bounties of the earth. Surely, to turn our backs on nature and all her beautiful works in sour disdain; to refuse to partake in the banquet spread out before us, because it may sometimes be enjoyed to excess; or to stifle those glorious impulses of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] genius, which, if anything on earth can claim so high a mission, are direct emanations from that spirit which is everywhere and eternal; to war on smiles and laughter, which are among the gifts bestowed on man alone, of all created beings, and to shut our senses in bitter spleen against all the good provided for us here---to do this, is surely neither conformable to reason, philosophy or religion, but a fanatical perversion of a glorious blessing. Harold became every day more deeply infected with this bitter piety, and both Susan and Miriam in some degree partook of its twilight gloom. They lived as it were in the shadow of life, and never enjoyed the sunshine in all its warmth and brilliancy. Still they were, perhaps, as happy as their neighbors; for it would be a sad thing if there was but one wholesome and palatable dish in this world, seeing that each one has his peculiar favorite. But Miriam was fortunate about this time in having a new excitement---a gentle one it is true---but any excitement was better than none, to one whose whole life was one day so like the other. At the expiration of some ten days, or perhaps a fortnight, after the interdict of the Cavalier, she was sitting at the window admiring the setting sun, and the many-colored, ever-changing tints of the river and the skies, which gave forth their brightest hues to the dying day. Without being actually engaged in contemplating the past, or anticipating the future, her fancy, like the butterfly among the flowers, was lightly skimming [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] from one to another, without closing its wings, or settling on either. In this state of wayward wandering, it all of a sudden occurred to her that she had not seen Langley Tyringham for a great while. She did not much like him to be sure, and cared not if she ever saw him again. He was too gay and flighty, too headlong and enthusiastic for her taste; and she had seen him actually drink wine. Nay, it was told her by Mildred, who had it from Gregory Moth, that he sometimes danced at balls at the capital, and had on more than one occasion attended a horse race. Such a man could be nothing to her; but still she could not help, somehow or other, wondering a little why he did not call at the house, or meet them in their evening walks, as he used to do once or twice a week. In a word, she began to think of Langley Tyringham, and the longer his absence continued, the more she wondered why, until at last her curiosity became quite uncomfortable. It was the old story; what she slighted in possession was valued when lost, and Miriam by degrees became conscious that Master Langley had been a very efficient spoke in the wheel of time. Of late that worthy old gentleman of the hour glass had limped along on a snail's gallop, and his scythe became so dull that he left a great many weeds behind in his path. Langley, too, had a grievous perplexity on his shoulders. He could not for the life of him see any reason why he should be prohibited visiting Miriam, merely because the two old gentlemen differed in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] politics and religion. He had no more to do with this than the man in the moon, who is a mighty indifferent old gentleman, and an example to all busy-bodies. At length, through a long rigmarole of ratiocination, he arrived at the conclusion, that unless there was something very particular to prevent, there was no particular reason for prevention. What this particular reason could be puzzled him sorely, until one evening it suddenly popped into his pericranium, that it must be Miriam, though it is believed this was the first time a reason was ever metamorphosed into a woman. But why this should be, was a question that always brought him to a dead stand, where he stuck fast, thinking and thinking, but always coming back to his old conclusion, that his father was afraid he might fall in love with, and marry the Roundhead's daughter. Thus it will be perceived that he was continually coupling Miriam and matrimony together, a most dangerous conjunction, worse than that of Virgo and the Twins. In this mystical state of mutual sympathy, which is said to be ominous of other mutual affinities, it so happened that Miriam, one balmy twilight in the merry month of May, which, in that genial southern clime is worthy all the raptures of the rascally poets, set forth on a lonely ramble by the river-side. A variety of good reasons might be given why she was not accompanied by one or both her parents, as usual, which would fill a page or two very comfortably to the author, and doubtless equally edifying to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] reader. But, notwithstanding the temptation, we shall content ourselves with stating, positively and unequivocally, that it was decreed by fate that Miriam should be alone that evening. Precisely at the same time did Master Langley, doubtless touched by that magnetic telegraph by which young people in love, or destined to fall in love, communicate with each other without being a whit the wiser, set forth in the same direction. It was a charming evening of the sunny south, when the lazy twilight, like some ancient dame picking her way through the increasing obscurity, and sounding the path with stick in hand, lingers long after the setting sun. The lord of day, though sunk behind the distant mountains, had left the reflection of his glories behind him in the skies, which presented a gorgeous array of purple, red, and gold, mingling with, and decking the light fantastic clouds that slept in the lap of the blue heavens, unmoved by a single breath of air, and yet were perpetually changing in hue and form. The broad river was at rest like all nature around, and only presented a quick succession of varying purple tints reflected from the skies. The mockbird, that Orpheus of nature's tuneful choir, was running the round of all his endless variations, and trilling forth his matchless melodies, with such a joyous hilarity, such a rich redundancy of extemporaneous song, that had any of our prima donnas heard him she would have died of envy. Other than the rural minstrel no sound met the ear, save ever and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] anon at a distance, and at distant intervals, might be heard the splashing of the huge strugeon, as he fell back from his ambitious attempt to see a little of the world above. The reader must pardon this sketch, for we delight in such scenes, whether of fancy or reality, and pity those, whether old or young, who have outlived, or never enjoyed, a wholesome relish of nature's enchanting beauties. The two wandering pilgrims saw each other at a distance, and, as they were proceeding opposite ways, of course gradually approached each other, without attempting to avoid a meeting. They actually did start a little at first sight, for it happened they were at that moment both thinking of the same thing. Langley was wondering at the prohibition of his father, and Miriam was wondering why he had ceased his visits. Certainly this was a wonderful coincidence, and foretold something extraordinary. As they were both walking along the same river path towards each other, it is obvious they must have met in time; and accordingly meet they did, under a great antediluvian tree, whose wide-spread branches overshadowed half an acre of stinted greensward. The ceremonies of meeting were very common-place, and if either blushed it passed unheeded by the other, for both had enough to do to hide their own. It is the proper business of women to begin first, because they are said to be always ready; and Miriam, seeing Master Langley in all appearance at a loss for words, addressed him in her simple Doric dialect: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] "Thou hast been a stranger at our house of late, Master Langley." Master Langley, not exactly knowing what to say, answered in that expressive monosyllable with which single ladies are wont to reply when asked a certain impertinent question, and another pause ensued. "Hast thou been absent?" "No." "Hast thou been ill?" "No." The maiden paused a few moments, and though she knew nothing of logic---having never had the benefit of Gregory Moth's instructions---actually achieved a syllogism. "He has not," thought she, "he has not been absent---he has not been ill---ergo, he did not wish to see me." The conclusion was, on the whole, not satisfactory. In the meantime, Master Langley had been chopping logic, too, and arrived at a conclusion, that it was equally due to Miriam and himself that he should apprise her of the cause of the abrupt cessation of his visits. This he did with all the frankness of his nature, adding, that though at a loss to know his father's reasons for the sudden prohibition, he had felt bound to conform to it, however contrary it might be to his wishes. "Alas!" replied Miriam, sorrowfully, "well do I know the reason. It is that which caused the persecutions of my dear mother and her parents; it is that which sets friends against friends, countrymen against countrymen, brother against brother, sons against [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] their fathers, and fathers against their children: it is that which deluged England with the blood of her sons; it is that which drove us from our home to seek a refuge in the wilderness of this new world. I thought not that it would cross the broad seas, and follow us here to set neighbor against neighbor, where it seems so necessary that all should unite in defence of each other. But the ways of heaven are not for me to scan. Doubtless all is right, or all will come right at last." There was no declamation or effort in all this. It was spoken with the most perfect simplicity, slowly, and in a voice of plaintive sweetness. Her face was calm and unruffled, yet touched by an expression of profound sorrow, hallowed by devout resignation. Her dark chestnut hair, which was quite anti-Puritan, and would curl in spite of the platform, fell back from her snowy brow as she raised her eyes towards heaven, and Langley, as he gazed on her innocent look, called to mind the pure, unspotted virgins offered up in olden time on the blood-stained altar of persecution. He felt too much to speak, and another silence ensued, which was again broken by Miriam. "Thy father hath seen it right to forbid thy coming to my father's house, and doubtless he wishes we should not meet elsewhere; continue thy walk and I will return." "Nay, Miriam, he did not forbid my seeing you by accident." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] "No, but that was doubtless intended in his prohibition. Good evening, Master Langley." "I entreat you to stay a moment. Surely my father cannot dislike one so young and unoffending as you. His resentment is against your father; and he is not, I assure you, of a disposition to confound the innocent with---with---" "With the guilty," interrupted Miriam with a sad smile, "with the guilty, thou wouldst say, after the manner of presumptuous mortals, who make their own principles, yea, often prejudices, the standard for the reason of others, and are not content with freedom themselves unless they can impose bondage on the rest of their fellow creatures. Good evening once again. I wish thee well, though thy father hath condemned me." There was truth in her voice and her eye as she said this; Langley was touched deeply as he gazed earnestly in her face and almost thought it beautiful. There was a placid and earnest simplicity in all she had said; a native dignity of manner, a proud humility, that awakened an interest he had never felt before, ardent in disposition, quick in his feelings, and prompt in expressing them, he gently arrested her departure, ontreating her to continue her walk and permit him to accompany her, this she gently but firmly declined; but finally acquiesced in a compromise, and assented to his accompanying her towards home. "You seem to wish it," said she, "and I at least [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] am not forbidden to meet thee, though I tell the frankly my father does not like thee." "I know it," replied Langley, "but I hope you don't partake in his dislike." "I do"---what she would have added was suddenly arrested by a slight embarrassment, and she said no more, as they continued their walk slowly, and with frequent pauses in the conversation. In truth, there seemed little accordance in their feelings, sentiments or opinions. By degrees, inspired by the mellowed luxury of the air, the beauties of the scene, and the fragrance of the blossoms of many a nameless shrub and plant that sprung up in wild luxuriance around them, Langley launched forth in his naturally poetic vein of talk, and became eloquent with feeling. The little Puritan girl listened and looked up into his face, as if half wondering and half admiring. Sometimes she answered not, and once she said with an almost breathless sigh--- "Though hast strong feelings and a virtuous mind, else thou couldst not thus revel in the delights of nature. Pity it is thou dost not look upwards from this beautiful earth to Him who created and bestowed it on His creatures." Langley thought of the Crop-ears; but though this speech did not exactly please him, there was a sincerity and fervor in the speaker, and such a beautiful expression of piety in her face, that he paused to admire it. "I am sorry," at length, he said, "that you don't [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] admire such a scene as this. Living as I have done, for the most part alone in the forests, without a companion in thought or feeling, I know not what I should have done had I not learned to commune with nature; to fall in love, and almost make her my mistress. You think it wrong to worship nature?" "To worship---but not to love her," answered Miriam, with a gentle smile. "Thou dost me wrong in thinking I am blind or insensible to the bounties of Heaven, or the beauties of nature. I love the green meadows, the silent, shady woods, the murmuring brooks, the waiving hills, and misty mountains. I love the lily's whiteness, the rose's blush, and the purple hyacinth, clothed in all the glories of nature's many-colored wardrobe. Whoever loves the Creator must love his beauteous handiwork. But the enthusiasm is catching," said she, checking herself and blushing, "I beseech thee not to laugh at me." "Laugh at you," cried Langley, with all his heart. "Laugh at you? By my soul, I love to hear you---go on, I entreat you." "I have nothing more to say, but that those who love the beauties of nature should be grateful to Him that spread out the banquet before them." "Who dares to say," exclaimed the youthful enthusiast, "who dares to say that piety is sour and repulsive? By my soul, as I see it now, it seems more lovely and alluring than all those temptations that lead astray the world." "No more of this, sir," said Miriam, gravely, "thou [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] hast twice invoked thy soul to witness for thee. Believe me, that when thus invoked it bears only testimony against thee." Langley was fairly unhorsed. His enthusiasm was checked in its flight; he again thought of the Crop-ears, and all his Cavalier prejudices were awakened. He could not at that moment forgive her, and she was suddenly transformed into a prim, starched, common-place Puritan. He did not know she was as much of an enthusiast as himself, only in a different way. In this mood they arrived at a little gate which opened into the wide lawn spreading out from Master Habingdon's house to the river. "Leave me now," said she, "I am at home, and thou must no farther transgress the command of thy father." "But I don't like to appear as if I were afraid of being seen. And besides, if I skulk away now, will it not be suspected that our meeting was not accidental?" "If my father or mother should think it so, I will tell them otherwise, and they will believe me. Good evening," added she, as Langley opened the gate, "or rather I should say, farewell, for though we live near each other, it may be long before we meet again, to take another pleasant walk together." "Ah! accident may bring it about again." "Think not so, Langley,"---she had never called him so before,---"it will not be accident if we walk there again at one and the same time. Promise me thou [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] wilt walk no more there of evenings, or I must walk elsewhere or stay at home." He promised, and she added---"Farewell, once more---who knows if we shall ever meet again. But this may be said by all that part, even for a moment. I shall often remember this evening." "And so shall I," said Langley. "Farewell, gentle Miriam, when I look back on the past, I shall often find you there." Miriam passed up the lawn, and Langley pursued his way towards home, sometimes belying his heart, by calling her a little canting prude, at others almost revering her piety and singleness of heart.

We call it republican---not to say democratic---because it is emphatically the poor man's luxury, innocent, cheap, and refreshing; one that he can enjoy at home in summer on his porch, in winter by his fireside, without seeking abroad for vagrant pleasures; one that, while it produces a gentle, harmless excitement, leads to no excesses, like the mischievous inspiration of wine, and whiles away the time in the intervals of exhausting labor. Well have the wise red men of the woods selected the pipe as the seal of reconciliation, the token that the bloody hatchet has been buried, for it is the very emblem of peace and repose. Would any man wish to calm his troubled spirit, ruffled by the rude elbowings of the busy world, or wasting away with disappointed hopes, or never-ending toil; would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] the philosopher wish to explore the depths of some unfathomable doubt, or metaphysical mystery; would the poet aspire to reach the highest haven of inspiration, or the lover seek to indulge himself in weaving a web of fancied bliss, let him light his pipe, and, like the fabled wand of the magician, it will conjure up before him such a host of happy ideas, that he will no longer seek the fruition of dull reality. Were we to attempt to exhibit a picture of content--- the only real happiness this earth affords---one that would attract the envy of mankind, we would set before them yonder grey-headed Dutch farmer, not fat, but round and portly, with his brown, ruddy face, calm as the noble river that flows along his verdant meadows. He is seated under his porch, one of the last remaining types of the little cocked hat, erewhile worn by the great Frederick of Prussia, and other celebrated warriors. He has finished his hay and harvest, his barns are full, and generous plenty laughs him in the face. It is a delightful summer evening, and it is not yet time to go to rest. No wind but the sweet southwestern zephyr, which the Indians say comes from the abode of the Great Spirit, ruffles the leaves or the waters; no noise but that of the rural concert of tinkling bells and lowing herds, nothing to awaken the wickedness of man, or afford his great enemy a bait to lead him astray. He has lighted his pipe, and the eddies of smoke ascend in spiral volumes, gradually fading away in boundless space. Beside him sits a wholesome, portly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] dame plying her knitting needles, and now and then it is clear, from the old man taking the pipe from his mouth, that they are exchanging a few words. On the lower step of the porch, and at a respectful distance, sits honest Coony O`Brien, of the Emerald Isle, a hired man, who, saving that he sometimes makes a respectable blunder, is as honest and well spoken a person as one would wish to meet with. He has saved from his wages enough to pay his brother's passage to the land where labor meets its due reward, and plenty sits laughing in the lap of liberty. Coony, too, is modestly smoking the stump of a pipe, black as ebony, and counting the days till the coming of his brother. Notwithstanding all the loyal and orthodox writers of England say of Irish ignorance, barbarity, and that sort of thing, they certainly have strong natural feelings and affections, and if they are impatient of the process of starvation, we must expect the apple to sputter a little while roasting. The honest fellow looks so comfortable that we could almost find in our heart to wish we were Coony O`Brien. A plague on those musty moralists who would feed the world with crab apples; who rail against the majesty of tobacco, and seek to deprive the poor and lowly of their cheap, as well as harmless, solace in the few short hours of cessation from labor. And most especially a plague on those pestilent rulers who leave the expensive luxuries of the rich unburdened, only to lay the load on the poor man's enjoyments. Smoke away, honest, portly Dutchman, and smoke away, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] Coony; if this is the worst thing you do would we were in your old shoes "Gregory---Gregory Moth!" exclaimed Master Tyringham somewhat impatiently, though the reader must not imagine Gregory was quite as long in answering his master's summons as we have been in weaving the foregoing train of philosophical speculation. "Coming, sir," answered the squire, "I am just knocking the ashes out of my pipe. Dust to dust, is the moral of smoking." "Have you seen Langley lately? I wish to speak with him. I hear more about the Indians, to-day. The Governor has sent us an express to put us on our guard." "For the love of mince pies, I beseech you, sir, not to mention those disagreeable heretics. It benumbs my faculties at once, and I have no use of myself for hours afterwards." "Will you be pleased, Master Gregory, for once in your life, to answer directly and categorically? Have you seen Langley lately?" "Why, sir, I can't say directly, categorically, or positively, for there is no trusting one's eyes, to believe what we see, unless it conforms to the deductions of science, and can be demonstrated on principles of philosophy. But if I might trust any of my five senses I saw him a little time ago walking along shore yonder." "Along shore? Why, what has come over the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] young blockhead to be rambling about alone by himself. Has he fallen in love, or grown poetical?" "Why, sir, if, as I before remarked, my eyes did not deceive me, I think I saw something walking beside him very like a woman." "A woman! impossible; why they are so scarce in these parts they are worth a hogshead of tobacco, inspection and all. Are you quite sure?" "I again aver that I can't say positively, seeing, as I before premised, there is no trusting the villanous five senses. The other night I thought I heard some one crying murder, but it turned out to be only a screech owl, and not long ago, sir---" "Gregory Moth, let me ask you one question: Have you any inclination to get your head broke? which will certainly happen if you don't answer me directly, and in as few words as possible." "Honored sir," quoth Gregory, "you doubtless know I am a man of few ideas, and consequently a great multiplicity of words. Allow me, by way of illustration--- a prudent man, with only one guinea in his purse, will---primo, divide it into shillings---secundo, into pence---and tertio, into farthings, before he ventures to expend the least modicum. I, sir, taking example from this judicious arithmetician, having, figuratively speaking, but one idea, essay to make the most of it by sub-dividing it grievously." "The fiend take you, and your one idea to boot. Was it a real bona-fide woman or not? Speak, villain, or die!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] "Patience, honored sir, you will drive my one idea to distraction. I opine it was a woman, howbeit, she certainly wore a petticoat; and, as we used to argue at Oxford, the man is only a remote circumstance of his dress, so may it be logically inferred that a two-legged animal wearing a petticoat is a woman." "Well, sirrah, having settled the species, can you tell who was the individual? Was she old, young, or middle-aged---black, white, or copper-colored?" "I am inclined to believe she was not old, as my young master stuck pretty close to her side. I draw the logical conclusion that she was not of a middle age, for she tripped along like a little zephyr, and I pronounce her most emphatically young, because Master Langley, like unto his father, has too much discretion to consort at evening walks with any other than a fair, blooming damsel, not more than eighteen at farthest." "Did you see her face---do you think you can identify the hussy?" "I was not watching them, sir. I scorn it. But I think I may say, without injury to my reputation for veracity, that it was the little Crop-eared damsel." "Impossible, Gregory, quite impossible. I have forbid him all communication with any of the family." "Hem," quoth Gregory, "now I am certain of it." At this critical moment Langley returning from his evening stroll, in what some unlettered people aptly call a fit of distraction, stumbled against Gregory Moth, whose pipe he shivered into countless pieces, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] and as usual, when people are themselves in fault gave him a broadside for standing in his way. The loss of a pipe was thought more of in those times than taking the benefit of "The Act" is now-a-days, as it could not be repaired within less than a score or two of miles. But Gregory was a philosopher, and proceeded to pick up the pieces with great deliberation. After which, like a wise man, he took his departure to see if he could not mend the matter." "Where have you been, sir," asked the father, rather sharply. "Taking a walk, sir," replied Langley. "Where?" "Along the river side, sir." "With whom?" "With Miriam Habingdon, sir." "Why, didn't I forbid your entering the door of that confounded Crop-ear again?" "I have not entered his door, sir. Our meeting was quite accidental, though I acknowledge we walked together afterwards. I accompanied her to the gate of her father's lawn, but did not go in." "Well---well---I believe every word you say. But did it not occur to you, that you were breaking your promise---at least the spirit of your promise, if not the word of my command?" "Why, sir"---replied Langley, smiling---"I confess it did come across me, after our walk was ended, that such might be the case. But really, I can't think [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] there was any great harm in availing myself of a mere accident." "Perhaps so---you may be of that opinion, sir---but I have my reasons, which as they are no concern of yours, I shall not trouble you with. I have my reasons, sir, for prohibiting not only your going to the Crop-ear's house, but associating either by accident or design with any of the family, most especially his daughter. I must beg of you then, sir, to understand this in future, accident or no accident; if you see Miriam Habingdon coming towards you, turn about and make tracks as if the old Harry himself were coming. If you see her going another way, you must turn short about." "And follow her?"---said Langley, laughing rather irreverently. "No, sir---I tell you, no---you must---you must---go to the d---l." And the indignant Cavalier turned into the house and sought his bed, it being his custom to retire early to roost, except when he had a few boon companions from the other side of the river to keep him awake. The reader will recollect it had been voluntarily settled between the two young people, that they should meet no more. Langley was content to accede to the arrangement, since he cherished no feeling towards Miriam strong enough to prompt him to resist the will of his father. "Why then,"---thought he, as he lay that night on his pillow, "why should my father [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] so peremptorily forbid what I had no intention of doing? There must be some special reason for this unwonted exercise of his authority, and now I recollect he said something about secret motives. What can they be? It is not possible that a mere difference in politics and religion can estrange two families residing so near each other, and having no neighbors within a distance of many miles. In this remote region surely the bitter feelings of hostility which were awakened in the old world, by mutual rivalry and bloodshed, cannot exist in such rank maturity as to produce fruits like these. What can it mean?" he again asked himself, and again the thought came over him that his father was apprehensive of an attachment between himself and Miriam. This set him musing on the probability of such an event; and in order to weigh the subject dispassionately, he recalled to mind the simple dress and unstudied gracefulness of Miriam; he dwelt on her piety, which had something poetical in its mode of expression; her love of flowers, so indicative of a pure taste and delicate sensibility, and her perception of the grandeur and beauty of nature, characteristic of a pious, elevated soul. From these, by a very natural transition, his memory and his fancy together, conjured up a vivid and exaggerated picture of her exuberant chestnut hair, which curled about the snow-white cheek, which never glowed, save when her heart beat rapidly, and her large, pensive, penetrating eyes, sometimes in despite [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] of themselves, sparkled of other joys than those of Heaven. The end of all this was, that Master Langley began to think there might be some reason for his father's apprehensions, and entered on a rigid self-examination which resulted in the conclusion that the thing was possible. In the midst of these cogitations, it cannot be denied, that a rising spirit of opposition, a feeling so often conjured up by what are deemed unreasonable exactions of parental authority---was awakened in the bosom of the son. "How can those,"---continued Langley, resuming his silent soliloquy---"How can those, that like my father, who, though loyal to his sovereign, has learned in this new world of unrestricted reason to scorn the slavish doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance--- how can they deny the application of this principle to a tyrant king, and apply it to a tyrant father! I am a man---I reason, and I draw conclusions. If left to myself, I can take care of myself, in danger and difficulty. I am past the age of correction, I should no longer be commanded. When rational beings differ in tastes, opinions, and principles, are they to break each other's heads, if strangers; or if they stand in the relation of parent and child---the latter arrived at years of discretion---is it for the father to command at will, and the son to obey against the impulses of his heart, and the convictions of his understanding? Where then is the authority of the parent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] to cease, and the freedom of the child to commence? The law says at one-and-twenty---but I am not mooting a question of law---hum---um---um." Here he began to grow sleepy. "The difference between what is reasonable, and what is not, is assuredly very plain if one could only see it; but like black and white, the edges may be so blended together that it is impossible to tell where one begins and the other ends." So Langley fell asleep, and again dreamed of the little Crop-ear. Precisely at the same moment the Cavalier was haranguing his son, the Roundhead was questioning his daughter, in a different style, but in the same spirit, and on the same subject; another proof that the destinies of these young people were spun from the same distaff. He inquired where she had been walking, with a cold gravity that savored of unkindness, a feeling far from his heart, for he loved his daughter almost as dearly as his own stubborn will. Miriam stated the simple truth, without hesitation, and without a single tell-tale blush to impeach her veracity, or betray a latent feeling. The mother, who was present, saw with the unerring instinct of woman, that it was a mere common-place affair; but the father, who was rather too much given to holding a tight rein, when the steed had no disposition to run away, took occasion to express his disapprobation of her rambling forth alone. "Do you think there is any danger, father?" said Miriam. "If you do I will not go out alone again, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] though I own I love the quiet summer twilight along the river. It makes me feel so calm, and awakens so many agreeable fancies." "Miriam," replied Harold, "knowest thou not that the indulgence of the imagination is dangerous to youth! It lures us astray from the path we are destined to tread in this weary pilgrimage, rough as it is, and leads to a worse, among thorns and briars." "But father, does it not sometimes lead us among the roses, as well as the thorns?" "Yea, daughter, to inhale their fragrance for a moment, and suffer for years from the wounds they inflict. The pilgrims of this world are destined to cope with that which is real, not that which has no existence; and they who, according to profane language, build castles in the air, will peradventure be crushed by their fall." "Ah! father, it may be so. But when I am rambling alone amid the delights of nature, breathing of sweets---seeing naught but what is pleasing in my eyes, and grateful to my heart, I cannot keep my mind within the narrow limits of reality. Methinks, I dream rather than feel; I seem to live in some other world, more beautiful even than this, and fancy a happiness I never felt, and never expect to feel. Yet is it delicious to my heart, and like the reflected glories of the sky at summer twilight, is far more soothing and gentle, than the real presence of that sun, from whence they derive their lustre." Harold gazed on her awhile in silence. He wondered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] where she learned to feel thus, and to express herself in such glowing terms. He forgot she was young, and that her teacher was that same Nature, which inspires the glorious love of song, gives magic to the strains of the musician, and teaches the artist almost to outdo his teacher. For a moment or two, he contemplated her with all the proud affection of a parent, but again relapsed into his usual frame of mind. He had sacrificed all for religion, and religion was all to him. Though he partook in moderation of the enjoyments of life, he persuaded himself it was because they were essential to existence, and not for the gratification of the senses. He grudged himself and his household any pleasure or relaxation that had not reference, in some way or other, to what he called the one thing needful. Thus his home was gloomy, his face gloomy, and all around him partook in the infectious gloom. His presence was a restraint, and his absence a relief. "Dost thou not know, Miriam," at length he said, "that such thoughts and feelings are carnal and wicked, seeing they lead astray from those higher purposes which should be perpetually before our eyes and in our hearts? But this is not what I wished to say just now. My object was to warn you against consorting with that profane and unbelieving youth, Master Langley Tyringham." "Unbelieving, father!" exclaimed Miriam, then suddenly checking herself, "I do not consort with him. Our meeting, as I told thee, was accidental, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] and will not be repeated. His father had forbidden him to come here." This information grated harshly on the feelings of Harold. His besetting sin of spiritual pride reared its head aloft, and the serpent hissed in his ear. "What an insult, in one of the imps of ungodliness to forbid the intercourse of a sinner with one of the saints! It is as if the spirit of darkness should turn his back in disdain on the spirit of light." True, it was calculated to bring about the very thing he was himself aiming at. Yet he was deeply mortified that the first movement had not come from him. He had long since persuaded himself that his temper was entirely subdued; a dangerous delusion, since it throws us off our guard, and induces us to drop the reins when they should be most firmly grasped. It is true he was able to repress all outward expression of passion; but the spirit of forgiveness was not within him. He swallowed his anger and it turned to gall. On this occasion he answered Miriam in his usual measured tone without any appearance of passion: "Thou shalt see the young man no more. If not an unbeliever he is one of those who have perverted the precepts of the only true faith. His sect, his family, and his father, have been the persecutors and revilers of thy father, thy mother, and thy whole race. They scourged and mutilated thy grandfather, who died in my arms on the field of Naseby, a martyr to his faith; they drove thy mother and grandmother from their homes, and made them outcasts; and they and their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] friends have banished me and mine, from that peaceful home which had sheltered my forefathers for eight hundred years, to this howling wilderness, to murder or be murdered by the savage Indians. Yet here, even here in the boundless solitudes of nature, the whip is brandished over our heads, the viper spits his venom, and the scorner continues to scorn. We are not, I find, permitted the free enjoyment of our consciences even here, for I have this day been apprised that we must attend at the church which has persecuted us to death, and hear ourselves and our faith contemned, or ridiculed, or pay a fine for liberty to stay away. Miriam, my daughter, wouldst thou mingle thy thoughts, or hold communion with one who has neither sympathy for our wrongs, respect for our faith, or feeling for our sufferings? Surely the grand-daughter of Isaac Baneswright, the martyr, will not even wish to do this; and here I declare that never while I live--- unless some dire necessity should occur---if I can prevent it, shalt thou see or speak to him more." "I do not wish it, father," answered Miriam somewhat sadly---"thy wishes shall be mine. I have never disobeyed thy will, and trust I never may." Harold, stern as he was, at least outwardly, was softened by the passive obedience of his daughter, and said to her kindly, "Now go to thy rest, my child, and shut thine eyes like yonder flower that closes its leaves against the dew of night. Commend thyself to Heaven, and sleep in peace." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] Miriam did not sleep in peace. The quiet current of her innocent thoughts, which had hitherto flowed along almost without a ripple, or a murmur, was disturbed. She thought to herself---"Surely the spirit of our faith cannot be that of mercy and forgiveness, or my father would not be so bitter against poor Langley. He never persecuted or slandered us, I am sure; he is too noble and generous for that; though, I confess, I never thought much of him, till I heard he was forbidden to see me. What can my father mean by my marrying Langley?" The attentive reader will recollect that Harold had not said a word about matrimony. "I am sure I have never dreamed of such a thing, but now he has put it into my head, I dare say I shall think of nothing else, can it be possible that Langley wishes to---to---what nonsense! But if he don't, how strange that my father should forbid what is never likely to happen." Thus she lay for hours, ruminating on love and marriage, mixed up with Langley Tyringham--- a most dangerous concatenation. At length she fell asleep, with a weight on her heart, without being able to tell exactly to what cause it was owing; whether to the sternness of her father, or his antipathy to such a harmless young man.

Pausing a moment, he shouted in a loud, decisive voice--- "Gregory Moth!" "Sir!" "Come hither---I want to speak with you." "Here I am, sir, in puris naturalibus \---that is to say, in my own proper person." "Gregory, do you know that Langley will come of age on Friday next?" "An unlucky day, sir. I thank my stars I was born on the twenty-ninth day of February, which being, as it were, no day at all, cannot be called unlucky." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] "Pooh---don't talk, sir, but listen. I mean to give a great dinner on the occasion." "Better not, sir---Master Langley is already rather hard in the mouth, and depend upon it, if you once put the toga on in him, he will take the bit between his teeth, and for aught we know run right into the arms of the little Crop-ear damsel." "No danger of that, Gregory. Has he not promised not to go near the house, and you know as well as I, he is a man of his word." "Sir, in the course of my study and observation of men, manners and customs, as well as the instincts of animals, I have never failed to notice that they all, man and beast, have a pernicious hankering after forbidden fruit, insomuch, that I am fully wrought into the conviction that were they permitted to do as they liked, they would never go out of their bounds." "A most logical conclusion, worthy the famous wild boar that swallowed a volume of Aristotle. Relieve them from all restraint and they will not require to be restrained. Eh? But have done with your nonsense, I am determined to celebrate this auspicious day by a grand dinner. I shall invite---" "The Roundhead gentleman, I suppose, for he is the only Christian man, besides ourselves, in twenty miles round, at least on this side the river." "No, sir, not the Roundhead. Do you call him a Christian man? Why, the fellow don't believe in the bishops. I mean to invite the Governor and council, the general-in-chief, the judge, the doctor, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] parson, who, you know, is not one of your water-drinking dissenters." "No, he never dissents from good wine; conforms exactly to a bowl of punch; and swallows the thirty-nine articles in as many bumpers." "Hold your tongue, sir, who has a better right to drink than a man with a quiet conscience? But we'll have the dinner, I'm determined, so set about making provision without delay. Let me see---ah--- yes---a haunch of venison at both ends---" "By your leave, sir," interrupted Gregory, "I would respectfully and reverentially recommend a boar's head at one end of the table, with a lemon in his mouth, and a red herring riding away on horseback, to come on with the second course, after the good old fashion of king Brute and his valiant Trojans, who, accompanied by certain Greek philosophers, came into Britain, and reached a place called Bellositum, afterwards Oxenford, where they feasted lustily on wild boars, and laid the foundation of that ancient seat of learning, eleven hundred years before the Christian era." "Confound me if I believe a word of it. But I have no objection to the boar's head, and the red herring riding on horseback, for I think the latter will be a new dish in these parts. But for all that, I don't believe one word about king Brute and his valiant Trojans. Why don't you go back to your favorite era, the creation. That is an excellent starting point."

If you had broached such a doubt at Oxford, you would have been expelled, as you told me the great John Locke had lately been, for heresy, or something else. You ought to have flourished at the time when the study of Greek was considered little better than heresy, and ego legit , and ego currit , held to be good Latin." The Cavalier seemed to pay little attention to this display of learning. He sat apparently in a fit of abstraction for a few minutes---then began nodding his head and rubbing his hands---concluding by passing the back of his right hand briskly across the end of his nose, right and left, as was his custom when tickled by any idea passing in his mind. "Ah, Moth, those were pleasant times at Oxford--- hey? Do you recollect the bonfire we made in the college walk on the Prince's birth-day, in spite of the Crop-ear proctors?" "And do you remember," said Gregory, "the plot of the students to expel the Crop-ear Garrison?" "Yes, and that you got tipsy drinking small beer, fell asleep on your favorite seat, The Penniless Bench, as it was called, and being waked up by the morning gun, was so frightened that you let out the whole secret." "And lucky was it for you all, sir; for I opine that if we had carried our plot into execution, we should have been terribly drubbed by the Ironside Crop-ears, and the survivors expelled incontinently. I peached from pure humanity, sir." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] "Very well, so be it. Now go and make your preparations, and mind there is no scarcity." "They shall have as much as they can swallow, sir." "Six times as much, Gregory. It don't become a Virginia planter, and Cavalier to boot, to stint his guests. But now I think of it, where the deuce is the Boar's Head to come from---eh? "Sir," said Gregory proudly, "did you ever know me to propose anything that could not be done. You know there are many swine that have strayed away into the forest, and become wild boars, to all intents and purposes. You will send your forester to shoot one of these, whether sow or boar is of no consequence. If he should fail, I will go and catch a sturgeon, and send up his head instead. If you ply the guests well with punch before dinner, they won't know the difference." "Good---right, Gregory, and if any man except the Governor and the parson questions its being a boar's head, I'll call him out. So now go at the business, and I'll consult Mistress Tyringham, about the puddings. There shall be a plum pudding at each end of the table, and two in the middle." The guests were bidden, the invitations accepted--- all but the governor, who was ill with the gout---for when people live a great distance from each other, they are always most anxious to meet---the wild boar was not shot, and the red herring mounted on horseback, ready for a drive. The excellent Mistress Tyringham [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] smiled at the boar's head and the red herring, besides hesitating a doubt, as to the six plum puddings. But being a sensible woman, she quietly acquiesced in any reasonable matter that pleased her husband. The day at length arrived, and with it the guests, who, in those days, were accustomed to come betimes, in order to whet their appetites for dinner by certain libations of punch, as that unequalled beverage, mint julep, was not yet discovered. It was the product of a more enlightened period, and doubtless stands first among those improvements which give one age a decided superiority over another. Gregory Moth was among the immortals. He had determined to celebrate the majority of his young master royally, first, because he had a great affection for the young man, secondly, because he had a still greater attachment to good liquor: accordingly, like a prudent man he began early, and was tolerably well ballasted before dinner. At the instant the guests entered one door of the dining-room, Gregory, as had been concerted with his master, came into the other, bearing the boar's, or rather sturgeon's head, most elaborately disguised, and singing a stave of a classical old song--- which ran as follows--- "The boar's head in hand bear I, Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary; And I pray you, masters, merry be, Quot, quot estis in convivio." Which was received with great applause. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] The commander-in-chief, who in his youth had served a campaign or two in Germany, was first helped, Mistress Tyringham, as is often the case among good housewives, having exerted herself so zealously in manufacturing the six plum puddings, that she was obliged to go to bed with a headache. At the first taste, the general-in-chief crossed his knife and fork, and looked doubtingly. The judge tried it twice, that he might, as it were, hear both sides; the doctor looked as if he had swallowed one of his own prescriptions; and the parson, as if he had swallowed a Jesuit or a Presbyterian. Master Tyringham did not know whether to laugh or be angry; Langley, who was not in the secret, wondered at the general abstinence; Gregory stuffed a napkin into his mouth, and the gentlemen of color in waiting showed a vast quantity of ivory. The general-in-chief tasted again, and again laid down his weapons. "It's d---d fishy; I ask your pardon for swearing in your presence, parson," said he, turning to the Rev. Mr. Truehart, who sat next him. "Truly, it has an ancient and fish-like smell," replied he, quoting Will Shakspeare. "Yes, and taste, too," said the general. "I have eaten of a boar's head more than once, in Bohemia, but I'll swear it did not taste like this. I say, Tyringham, where did this boar come from?" "Why, Gregory says he was shot somewhere in the forest, yonder." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] "I should rather suppose it was in the river, for between you and me, it tastes more like fish than flesh." Here Gregory, seeing his master at fault for an answer, made a diversion in his favor. "If the general-in-chief will permit me, it is dressed after the manner of King Brute and his valiant Trojans, with crab sauce. Besides, sir, the wild boars often come down to the river to feed on the clams and periwinkles, which give them a fishy taste sometimes." "That is a curious fact in natural history, Mr. Truehart. You who are fond of such studies should investigate the matter," said the general aside to his neighbor. By this time a general titter circulated round the table, and the Cavalier began to perceive the joke was turning against him, especially when the doctor exclaimed, "A sturgeon's head, by all the gods," and burst into a roar of laughter. He debated within himself whether to call out the doctor, make Gregory the scapegoat, or make an honest confession. Being both bold and generous, he determined on the last course, and told the whole story. The sturgeon's head, so far from disturbing the harmony of the company, only occasioned a more general merriment. Gregory was quizzed unmercifully about the boar's head, and the red herring riding on horseback; while the general-in-chief took occasion to tell the story of a servant of his from the old country, who being sent out to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] procure a sheep's head, instead of a fish brought back the head of a fine old ram with magnificent horns. But Gregory stood fire like a hero; at every shot he reinforced his courage with a stiff glass of punch, and came off with flying colors. Though a systematic tippler, he never got fairly seas over, or lost the command of his head or his legs. He resembled those tempers which are easily pushed to a certain point, beyond which they are immovable. Like a bottle, the fuller he was the stiffer he stood. The rest of the dinner went off swimmingly. The venison and wild turkey amply atoned for the sturgeon's head; the becon and greens were received with the honors of a national dish, and the plum puddings met with universal acceptation. Poor Langley was called upon so often to exchange bumpers in honor of the occasion, that he became at last oblivious, and fell asleep in his chair; whereupon the Cavalier winked to the company and said---"Now that the old gentleman has retired, suppose we young fellows make a night of it. Come, a toast, and a song from the doctor." The master of the seven sciences, who valued himself on his singing, toasted "Church and King," and forthwith followed it up with rare Ben Jonson's exquisite song, "Drink to me only with thine eyes," which he sung with great unction, but repeated the chorus so often, that the general-in-chief at length exclaimed---"Doctor, how many eyes had this same lady? I think she must have had as many as a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] amprey. Your song has as many eyes as a peacock's tail, or a piece of bird's-eye maple." "Yes," said the doctor, good humoredly, "she saw double, like some of the present company, that shall be nameless." The laugh went against the general-in-chief, who was fined a stupendous bumper for interrupting the song; and not to give offence to scrupulous folks by descending to further particulars, the merriment was kept up far into the night, and the morning dawned on a set of quiet gentlemen peaceably sleeping in their chairs. The scrupulous reader may be assured that not a single one of them was under the table, and that they maintained the strictest silence and decorum. This circumstance will, it is hoped, make some atonement for our having introduced a scene, with a view to illustrate the manners of the times. For so doing, we earnestly hope forgiveness from all conscientious tetotalers, especially those who convert abstinence from one sin into a license for indulging half a dozen others. This is said to be not altogether uncommon, as was exemplified in the case of the Italian robber, who quieted his conscience for the habitual commission of murder by scrupulously abstaining from flesh on Fridays. But however this may be, there are certainly many sins more grievous than making merry occasionally with our friends, provided we don't disturb our conscientious neighbors. It has been or it might be truly remarked, that though you may exclude the air from escaping out of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] a bottle, it is impossible to do so with a secret. Cork it up as tightly as you will, seal it hermetically if you please, but it will be just as vain as to attempt to hold an eel by the tail. This is most especially the case in the country; and what is very remarkable, people that live at a distance from each other, are almost always the soonest enlightened by such disclosures. The carousal of the old Cavalier, however, was not intended to be kept secret in the first instance. But certain incidents which are here related, rendered it desirable that the point of honor metaphorically conveyed by the classic phrase of "Under the Rose," should be observed. Yet by some means or other, never fully developed, the particulars of the whole affair, greatly exaggerated, were in less than twelve hours conveyed to the ears of Harold Habingdon and his family, by telegraph or otherwise. It was said that the old Cavalier had sacrilegiously set fire to the parson's wig, and that the latter had swore like a trooper on the occasion; that the judge had not only nodded on the bench, but pitched head foremost under the table; that the general-in-chief had cleared the board of bottles and glasses, sword in hand; that the doctor had sung such vulgar and indecent songs, that Mistress Tyringham was obliged to leave the table; and finally that Master Langley had signalized his majority, by getting superlatively corned, and fighting a pitched battle with Gregory Moth. The dislike of Harold towards the old Cavalier was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v1&image=316-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] by these rumors increased to disgust. Almost every man has his peculiar horror of some one particular vice or foible, and the antipathy of Harold was drinking, though he was in truth rather addicted to good eating, and was apt to be a little ruffled at an ill-cooked dinner. But so it is. Habit and custom is everything. In Russia and China, it is no disgrace to be cudgelled; while among the people of Europe, and emphatically among Americans, a blow is considered an indelible stain on manhood, and is never submitted to without incurring contempt and disgrace. What is held indecent and barbarous in one place, is perhaps the highest ton in another; and in all the wide circumference of this world, there are not two nations that agree exactly in their estimate of manners or morals. All have their different standards, and all might learn from this diversity, to abstain from offensive scurrility, or contemptuous airs of superiority. Miriam, too, was highly indignant at the backsliding of Langley Tyringham, though she certainly had no right whatever to be angry. What was he to her, or she to him---nothing. They were to be strangers in future, and there was no reason in the world why she should care a straw if he got fuddled every day. Still she felt angry, as well as sorry. It was a great pity, she thought, that so clever a youth should thus throw himself away, by becoming addicted to an odious, beastly vice. Above all, when her fancy pictured him engaged in a drunken fight, with Gregory Moth, she [
