It is addressing my[s]elf to, and calling up the attention of a multiplicity of [s]trangers; it is introducing not my[s]elf indeed, but what is nearly the [s]ame thing, the offspring of my imagination, to their notice, and con[s]cious as I am, that it will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page xii. ] be peru[s]ed by tho[s]e, who are infinitely my [s]uperiors, this awkward timidity encrea[s]es, to an almo[s]t unconquerable degree. "The works of fiction," [s]ays Dr. John[s]on, "with which the pre[s]ent ge "neration [s]eems more particularly de "lighted; are [s]uch as exhibit life in "its true [s]tate, diver[s]ified only by ac "cidents that daily happen in the "world, and influenced by pa[s][s]ions "and qualities, which are really to be "found in conver[s]ing with mankind. "In narratives, where hi[s]torical vera "city has no place, I cannot di[s]cover "why there [s]hould not be exhibited "a mo[s]t perfect idea of virtue, not an "gelical, nor above probability; for "what we cannot credit, we [s]hall ne "ver imitate; but the highe[s]t and pur "e[s]t that humanity can reach, which "exerci[s]ed in [s]uch trials as the various "revolutions of things [s]hall bring up "on it, may, by conquering [s]ome ca "lamities, and enduring others, teach "us what we may hope, and what we "can perform." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page xiii. ] Upon this plan I have endeavoured to form the "Trials of the Human Heart." My Heroine, though not wholly free from error, (for where [s]hall we find the human being that is [s]o?) I tru[s]t is not altogether unworthy imitation. Through various trying [s]ituations, as daughter, wife, and mother; I have [s]trove to conduct her with propriety, tempering the weakne[s]s of humanity with the patience and fortitude of a Chri[s]tian, and that dignified pride, which will ever ari[s]e from a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of the moral virtues. It is with reluctance I find my[s]elf obliged to remark, that the literary world is infe[s]ted with a kind of loathsome reptile, of the cla[s]s of non-de[s]cripts, for it cannot be ranked with propriety among[s]t either authors or critics, not po[s][s]e[s][s]ing the qualifications nece[s][s]ary to form either, and being in it[s]elf remarkable for nothing but its noxious qualities: its only aim is to prevent the [s]ucce[s]s of any work of genius; and [s]welling with envy, [s]hould the [s]malle[s]t part of public favour, be conferred on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page xiv. ] another, [s]pits out its malignant poi[s]on, in [s]currility and detraction. One of the[s]e noi[s]ome reptiles, has lately crawled over the volumes, which I have had the temerity to [s]ubmit to the public eye. I [s]ay crawled over them, becau[s]e I am certain it has never penetrated beyond the title-page of any. Perhaps it would be as well, did I [s]uffer this circum[s]tance to pa[s]s unnoticed; the arguments u[s]ed, I mu[s]t confess, are unan[s]werable, being in [s]ome parts incomprehen[s]ible, and in others of [s]uch a nature, that no woman can glance her eye over them, without feeling the blu[s]h of offended delicacy crimson her cheek. Yet, as I have been accu[s]ed of writing in an improper [s]tyle in my Novel of the "Fille de Chambre," and of expre[s][s]ing [s]entiments foreign to my heart, in my Comedy of "Slaves in Algiers," I think it nece[s][s]ary to a[s][s]ure the candid and impartial public, that both the[s]e a[s][s]ertions are equally fal[s]e and [s]candalous. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page xv. ] Though many a lei[s]ure hour has been amu[s]ed, and many a [s]orrowful one beguiled, whil[s]t giving Fancy the reins, I have applied my[s]elf to my pen, it has ever been my pride, that I never yet wrote a line that might tend to mi[s]lead the untutored judgment, or corrupt the inexperienced heart; and heaven forbid I [s]hould [s]uffer ought to e[s]cape my pen, that might call a blu[s]h to the cheek of innocence, or de[s]erve a glance of di[s]plea[s]ure from the eye of the mo[s]t rigid morali[s]t. As to my opinion of the political concerns of America, or my wi[s]hes in regard to her welfare, I cannot better explain them, than by giving a [s]light [s]ketch of my private hi[s]tory, with which, I rather imagine, the creature alluded to, is entirely unacquainted. It was my fate, at a period when memory can [s]carcely retain the smallest trace of the occurrence, to accompany my father, (Mr. William Ha[s]well, who is a lieutenant in the Briti[s]h navy) to Bo[s]ton in New England, where he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page xvi. ] had married a [s]econd wife, my mother having lo[s]t her life in giving me existence. Ble[s]t with a genteel competency, and placed by his rank and education in that [s]phere of life, where the polite and friendly attentions of the mo[s]t re[s]pectable characters courted our acceptance, and enjoying a con[s]tant intercour[s]e with the families of the officers of the Briti[s]h army and navy, then [s]tationary there, eight years of my life glided almo[s]t imperceptibly away. At that time the di[s][s]entions between England and America encrea[s]ed to an alarming degree: my father bore the king's commi[s][s]ion, he had taken the oath of allegiance; certain I am that no one who con[s]iders the nature of an oath, voluntarily taken, no one who reflects, that previous to this period, he had [s]erved thirty years under the British government, will blame him for a [s]trict adherence to principles which were interwoven as it were with his existance. He did adhere to them, the attendant con[s]equence may readily [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page xvii. ] be [s]uppo[s]ed; his per[s]on was confined, his property confi[s]cated. Then it was that the benevolence and philanthropy, which [s]o eminently distinguish the [s]ons and daughters of Columbia made an indeliable impre[s][s]ion on my heart, an impre[s][s]ion which neither time or chance can obliterate, for while their political principles obliged them to afflict, the humanity, the Christian like benevolence of their [s]ouls, incited them to wipe the tears of sorrow from the eyes of my parents, to mitigate their [s]ufferings, and render tho[s]e afflictions in [s]ome mea[s]ure supportable. Would to Heaven it was in my power to render their memories as immortal, as my gratitude is unbounded. Having been detained as a pri[s]oner two years and an half, part of which was [s]pent in Hingham , and part in Abington; an exchange of pri[s]oners taking place between the Briti[s]h and Americans, my father and his family were [s]ent by cartel to Halifax, from whence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page xviii. ] we embarked for England. I will not pretend to de[s]cribe the [s]orrow I experienced, in being thus [s]eparated from the companions of my early years: every wi[s]h of my heart was for the welfare and pro[s]perity of a country, which contained [s]uch dear, [s]uch valuable friends, and the only comfort of which my mind was capable, was indulging in the delightful hope, of being at [s]ome future period permitted again to revi[s]it a land [s]o beloved, companions [s]o regretted. Too young at that time, to have formed any political principles of my own, I may naturally be [s]uppo[s]ed to have adopted tho[s]e of my father, but the truth is, that equally attached to either country, the unhappy di[s][s]entions affected me in the [s]ame manner as a per[s]on may be imagined to feel, who having a tender lover, and an affectionate brother who are equally dear to her heart, and by whom [s]he is equally beloved, [s]ees them engaged in a quarrel with, and fighting again[s]t each other, when, let which[s]oever party conquer, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page xix. ] [s]he cannot be [s]uppo[s]ed in[s]en[s]ible to the fate of the vanqui[s]hed. During a period of twelve years a variety of painful circum[s]tances unnecessary here to recount, contributed to deprive me of a decent independence inherited from my paternal grandfather, and at length to bring me back to America, in a very different [s]ituation, I mu[s]t confe[s]s, from that in which I left it; but with a heart, [s]till glowing with the [s]ame affectionate [s]en[s]ations, and exulting in its evident improvement: the arts are encouraged, manufactures increa[s]e, and this happy land bids fair to be in the cour[s]e of a few years the mo[s]t flouri[s]hing nation in the univer[s]e. Is it then wonderful, that accu[s]tomed from the days of childhood, to think of America and its inhabitants with affection, linked to them by many near connections, and [s]incerely attached to them, from principles of gratitude, that I [s]hould offer the mo[s]t ardent prayers for a continuation of their pro[s]perity, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page xx. ] or that feeling the benign influence of the ble[s][s]ings of peace and liberty, here [s]o eminently enjoyed, I [s]hould wi[s]h that influence extended throughout every nation under heaven. Before I conclude, I beg leave to [s]ay a few words more, concerning my present publication. I am willing to flatter my[s]elf, that in offering this novel to the public, I am not preparing for my future life, either [s]hame or repentance. That it is throughout the whole, happily imagined or highly poli[s]hed, I have not [s]ufficient confidence in my own abilities to warrant; but whatever may be my final [s]entence from the world in general, I have at lea[s]t endeavoured to de[s]erve their kindne[s]s, nor [s]hall I envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cau[s]e, if I may be [s]o happy as to awaken in the bo[s]oms of my youthful readers, a thorough dete[s]tation of vice, and a [s]pririted emulation, to embrace and follow the precepts of Piety, Truth and Virtue. MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE. -  Woodbine Cot April 20 th , 1775. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 001. ] Will you believe me, Celia, when I tell you, I wi[s]h I was at Bologne again; that I am di[s][s]atisfied and unhappy. You are [s]urpri[s]ed. It is neverthele[s]s certainly true. We formed erroneous opinions of the world; we thought it a paradi[s]e compared to the [s]olemnity and gloom of our convent. Tru[s]t me, my dear, I have as yet found nothing, in this gay, bu[s]y world, half [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] plea[s]ing, as that [s]weet retirement. But I forget that this is my fir[s]t letter, and that you naturally wi[s]h to know every incident which has happened [s]ince our [s]eparation. This innocent curio[s]ity [s]hall be gratified, and to begin: During our journey, Mr. Verdome informed me that the rea[s]on of my being [s]ent for home [s]o [s]uddenly, was to attend Mrs. Mirvan, my godmother, who had been for a long time ill, and was [s]uppo[s]ed to be in a deep decline. "She went to Bri[s]tol," continued he, "a few days before I left England; your mother accompanied her, your father and Mrs. Talbot were to follow the en[s]uing week; we [s]hall, therefore, on our arrival in England, [s]et forward immediately for that place. "Who is Mrs. Talbot?" [s]aid I. "She is," replied Mr. Verdome, "a widow lady, who, being left in rather indigent circum[s]tances, and being a di[s]tant relation of the family, has accepted an a[s]ylum in your father's hou[s]e." "If [s]he is an amiable woman," [s]aid I, "my mother mu[s]t be happy in having [s]uch a companion." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] "She is [s]en[s]ible, well bred, and good antured," he replied---and here the conversation dropped. I was, as you may ea[s]ily imagine, too much taken up with the di[s]agreeable sensation of [s]ea-[s]ickne[s]s, to be able to reflect much, while cro[s][s]ing the channel: but no [s]ooner was I in the chai[s]e, proceeding toward Bristol, than I began to form a thou[s]and different ideas about meeting my parents, not having [s]een either of them [s]ince I could remember. I pictured them to my[s]elf, as very amiable old people---and, in fancy, felt their embraces and ki[s][s]ed off the tears of joy I [s]aw falling from their eyes. Celia, we children of [s]implicity form [s]trange enthu[s]ia[s]tic notions. In thinking of my dear Mrs. Mirvan, I felt more lively [s]en[s]ations; becau[s]e I was certain if [s]he lived, when I arrived, I [s]hould be received by her with heart-felt satisfaction, and [s]hould I find her no more, my own heart would experience the mo[s]t acute angui[s]h. You mu[s]t remember how much I am indebted to her tenderne[s]s and affection, and how very happy I was whenever [s]he visited our convent. At length we arrived at the end of our journey. I trembled [s]o, that I could scarcely [s]upport my[s]elf. Expectation, hope, fear, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] by turns were predominant in my bo[s]om. When we [s]topped, a hand[s]ome man, in appearance about five and thirty or forty years of age, handed me from the chai[s]e, and saluting me, [s]aid to Mr. Verdome, "faith [s]he is a very fine girl." I [s]aw Mr. Verdome [s]rown; but had not time to make any further remarks, before I found my[s]elf in the chamber of my godmother. Oh Celia! how that dear woman was altered; her face pale, eyes [s]unk and [s]o reduced that [s]he could not ri[s]e to meet me. She faintly [s]miled when I entered the room, I could not [s]peak. I [s]aw nothing, thought of nothing, but her; and running to her threw my arms round her neck and bur[s]t into tears. "Dear creature," [s]aid Mrs. Mirvan (embracing me) "we have [s]urpri[s]ed her. She was not prepared to [s]ee me thus, but come, my love, dry your tears; here is another lady, who indeed [s]hould have been the fir[s]t object of your attention." I turned round and beheld the mo[s]t beautiful woman, you can conceive, bending over me, her eyes full of tears. "My child, my beloved Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, taking me in her arms; "have you no recollection of your mother?" Whil[s]t I was folded in her maternal embrace the door opened, and my mother continued, "come Mr. Howard welcome your daughter." I rai[s]ed my head from my dear mother's bo[s]om, and was [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] [s]ame gentleman, who had handed me from the chai[s]e. "Your father, Meriel," [s]aid my mother. I bent one knee to the ground and ki[s][s]ed his hand. But [s]hall I confe[s]s that whil[s]t in that action, which [s]hould have expressed filial re[s]pect and love, I felt more of terror than either. "Ri[s]e girl, ri[s]e," [s]aid he, "I have no ta[s]te for the[s]e fine romantic [s]cenes. You knelt, becau[s]e you were told it would be expected, not from any genuine impul[s]e of the heart." My poor mother looked di[s]tre[s][s]ed. "I hope," [s]aid I, in a faultering voice, "I hope, [s]ir, my conduct will henceforth convince my dear parents, that I am wanting in neither duty nor affection." "We [s]hall [s]ee," [s]aid he, carele[s]sly. "You women in general talk well, but as to your obedience and submission, when you are put to the trial you always fall far [s]hort of your profe[s][s]ions."

Oh! cried the unfeeling man, if you are for a whimpering party, I [s]hall leave you to your[s]elves, and go and fini[s]h my game at piquet with Mrs. Talbot. When he was gone, I felt my[s]elf relieved, and entered into conver[s]ation with my mother and Mrs. Mirvan: though I could not but ob[s]erve the hard [s]truggle my dear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] parent had to repre[s]s her tears; I dared not notice her di[s]tre[s]s, lea[s]t by [s]o doing, I [s]hould increa[s]e it: be[s]ides I judged, that however palpable my father's errors might be, it would be an ungrateful [s]ubject to her, especially from the lips of a child. For the fir[s]t [s]ew days after my arrival, we flattered our[s]elves, that Mrs. Mirvan was much better; but this enchanting illu[s]ion [s]oon vani[s]hed. We had been one morning chatting on her evident amendment, and [s]he told me, when able to [s]upport the fatigue of a journey, [s]he would go to the [s]outh of France, and I [s]hould accompany her. She wi[s]hed my mother to go; but that dear good woman, [s]ays [s]he, can never leave your father for [s]o long a time, (and his fortune being but [s]mall will not allow the whole family to take [s]uch a journey.) At dinner time, [s]he eat the wing of a chicken, and [s]eemed to cat with an appetite; after which [s]he drank a gla[s]s of Madeira; and in a [s]hort time complaining of drow[s]ine[s]s, laid down on the sopha; my mother retired to her own room, and I took up a volume of Pope's Homer, to amu[s]e my[s]elf. For [s]ome time, her [s]leep [s]eemed compo[s]ed, but [s]he [s]oon grew re[s]tle[s]s, breathed quick, and frequently [s]tarted, every now and then fetching a deep [s]igh, which terminated in a kind of convul[s]ive groan. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] was alarmed and rang the bell, but before any one an[s]wered it, I perceived my beloved godmother was in [s]trong convul[s]ions; my [s]hrieks brought the whole family to the room; a phy[s]ician was [s]ent for, but alas! nothing could be done. She was immediately put to bed; but never recovered her [s]en[s]es until a few moments before the final [s]cene clo[s]ed. In that [s]hort interval, [s]he beckoned my mother towards her, and putting my hand in hers, thus addre[s][s]ed me, though with difficulty. "Meriel, you are the only comfort that dear [s]uffering [s]aint po[s][s]e[s][s]es; let mutual friend[s]hip cement the bonds of natural affection; my child never for[s]ake your mother, [s]o [s]hall the father of mercies never for[s]ake you." I cla[s]ped my arms round my weeping parent, and articulated a vow to heaven, never to let her know a grief or pain, it was in my power to remove. My fortune, my peace of mind, my reputation, my life, every thing but integrity of heart, [s]hould be [s]acrificed to in[s]ure her felicity. "Enough, my child," faintly cried Mrs. Mirvan, "the Creator of the univer[s]e has heard, and accepts your vow. Oh Meriel!" continued [s]he, after a pau[s]e, "let it be thro' life ever pre[s]ent to your memory, that you mu[s]t one day be as I am now, trembling on the verge of eternity. Love thy Maker above all things, and thy fellow creatures as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] thy[s]elf; 'tis that alone can [s]upport".---She could articulate no more, but her lips [s]till moved. She cla[s]ped her hands earne[s]tly; rai[s]ed her eyes toward tho[s]e bli[s]sful regions to which her pure [s]oul a[s]pired, and with a placid [s]mile [s]unk to eternal re[s]t. "Oh!" [s]aid I, as I dropped on my knees by her bed [s]ide, "let me live a life of purity, that my death may be like hers." Amen, amen, cried my mother, as the rai[s]ed me from the ground. We retired to her apartment, where cla[s]ped in each others arms, we pour'd forth that tribute of affliction, the merits of our lo[s]t friend demanded. IN CONTINUATION. April 24 th . I was [s]o oppre[s][s]ed by the melancholy subject, that I could not for [s]ome time re[s]ume it. Pardon me, Celia, I do not mean to tritrifle with your friendly anxiety, I [s]hall, therefore, pur[s]ue my narrative. When we had attended all that remained of the amiable Mrs. Mirvan to the grave; our family returned to Woodbine Cot. I do not [s]peak of the conduct of my father during this melancholy period, becau[s]e it could neither excite my veneration or your e[s]teem. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] Mrs. Talbot conducted her[s]elf with great propriety, exerted her[s]elf to comfort and cheer my mother, tho' I cannot tell why that dear woman did not receive her attentions with that grateful [s]weetne[s]s, which [s]he ever manife[s]ted to others. I think Mrs. Talbot a mo[s]t engaging woman. She is not [s]o hand[s]ome as my mother, but has a great deal more vivacity. She is tall, well made, and has a very expre[s][s]ive countenance, is affable, conciliating and extremely [s]en[s]ible; [s]he is [s]o kind as to a[s][s]i[s]t and direct my studies. You know I am very fond of natural hi[s]tory. She frequently reads to me, and afterwards we [s]aunter thro' the garden, fields and meadows in [s]earch of subjects to illu[s]trate what we have read. In the[s]e rambles my mother accompanies us, but it grieves me to [s]ee [s]uch a [s]ettled melancholy impre[s][s]ed upon her countenance. My brother Richard ye[s]terday came from [s]chool for a few days. I can percieve he is my father's favourite, indeed my mother is extremely partial to him, tho' it is with pain I remark many unamiable traits appear evident in his di[s]po[s]ition, tho' as yet he has [s]een but thirteen years, being three years younger than my[s]elf. His behaviour to me was very ungracious, when we were fir[s]t introduced to each other. Tho' I had never [s]een him, yet as children of the [s]ame parents [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] I felt my heart drawn toward him by an irresistable impul[s]e. I therefore on hearing of his arrival, ran down [s]tairs and was going to welcome him with a cordial embrace, but the frigid coldne[s]s that his countenance displayed repre[s][s]ed my ardour. He advanced, ju[s]t touched my cheek and bowing profoundly, wi[s]hed me joy of my fortune. "Joy! brother [s]aid I, indeed I have not thought of any thing but regret, for the [s]ad occa[s]ion of my becoming mi[s]tre[s]s of this fortune; would to heaven! dear Mrs. Mirvan were [s]till alive to enjoy tho[s]e few thou[s]ands, the acqui[s]ition of which cannot compen[s]ate to me for the lo[s]s of her valuable [s]ociety." "She was to be [s]ure a good old woman," [s]aid he, carelessly, "but you know [s]i[s]ter, [s]he was very infirm, [s]o I think [s]he is much happier out of the world than in it." "Come, come Richard," [s]aid my mother, with a look, half [s]miling, half frowning, "I mu[s]t not hear you [s]peak lightly of an event, which has [s]o highly distressed us all." Ma[s]ter Richard [s]miled contemptuously, turned on his heel, hummed a tune and walked out of the room. How happens it, Celia, that the child of a woman po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]uch an excellent heart, and [s]uch exqui[s]ite [s]en[s]ibility [s]hould be [s]o very unfeeling; perhaps you will [s]ay he cannot re[s]emble both parents; true, too true, it is a ju[s]t remark; but oh how [s]uperiatively [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] happy would be my lot if both tho[s]e parents re[s]embled each other. We live very retired, my father's income will not [s]uffer him to a[s][s]ociate with the higher cla[s]s of inhabitants of the village, and his pride keeps him from tho[s]e in the middling or lower walks of life. We are, therefore, vi[s]ited by very few, nor among tho[s]e few have I [s]een one, with whom my heart would claim acquaintance. Surely, Celia, there mu[s]t be women in the world, and young women too, who are different from any I have [s]een here. There are two families whom my mother is permitted to vi[s]it, and there are daughters in each family: but whenever we meet, which indeed is but [s]eldom; they have [s]o much to tell me concerning their lovers, their dre[s][s]es and their petty differences with each other, that we have not a moment for rational conver[s]ation. By this account you will naturally suppose my time cannot pa[s]s in the mo[s]t agreeable manner. I devote great part of my mornings to reading, drawing, mu[s]ic, and needle work, and had I but my Celia here I could be tolerably ea[s]y; though I can never be happy, while I [s]ee my mother oppressed with [s]orrow, which I can neither participate nor relieve. I have had little or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] no conver[s]ation with my father; as he [s]till continues the [s]ame indifference towards me which I experienced at our fir[s]t meeting. I [s]hall continue to write to you my friend, tho' I can fore[s]ee my letters will contain but little variety: however it will be the means of keeping alive that friend[s]hip, which is to me [s]o valuable, and a time may come when I [s]hall be again happy in your [s]ociety. Till then believe me in [s]incerity yours. MERIEL HOWARD. MRS. TALBOT to LUCETTA ASKHAM. May 2d .

Mrs. Howard did not think her own family a proper place for the tuition of a girl. She was right: her hu[s]band is by no means a brilliant example, and I think, it would be a fortunate circum[s]tance for young Howard was any thing to happen that might [s]eperate him from his father. Meriel is not what is generally termed a fine girl; [s]he is rather below the middle [s]ize, and inclined to en bon point;  her face is not regularly pretty, but [s]he has a lovely pair of hazel eyes, through which you may read every emotion of her [s]oul. She is fair, a fine glow of health animates her face, and a [s]mile of good humour plays about her mouth; a luxuriant quantity of che[s]nut hair hangs in ringlets down [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] her neck and [s]hades a forehead that is ornamented with the mo[s]t beautiful eye-brows I ever beheld. Yet [s]he is not [s]triking at fir[s]t [s]ight, indeed, you would rather be tempted to [s]ay [s]he was plain, but the moment [s]he [s]peaks you mu[s]t be charmed. I have heard women [s]ing who have fine voices; but I would rather hear Meriel read a pathetic tale than li[s]ten to the fine[s]t [s]ingers in England. The melody of her voice, is [s]o [s]oft that [s]he makes the meane[s]t [s]ubject intere[s]ting; her countenance intelligent, her mind fraught with every gentle, generous virtue, but withall [s]he is the pure child of nature. I could not have believed it po[s][s]ible for a girl of [s]ixteen to be [s]o artle[s]s and innocent. An entire [s]tranger to deception, [s]he [s]eeks not to disguise one emotion of her heart. She loves neither her father nor her brother. I cannot blame her, their [s]ouls are not congenial with her own. Yet does [s]he [s]trive by respect and attention to attone for the deficiency. I am [s]o charmed with this dear girl, who is a brilliant model of her mother's virtues; with this difference, Mrs. Howard's are pa[s][s]ive virtues: Meriel's will prove active ones. I am [s]o captivated with her gentle innocence that I find I can no longer remain in the family: Lucetta aid me to fly from infamy, from [s]hame, from a black train of evils that I [s]ee ready to encompa[s]s me.

Celia , if you value your own happine[s]s never de[s]ire to quit the convent. When I was there, I imagined my father a worthy character. Had I never left it, I had never been undeceived: indeed, it is a [s]ad, [s]ad thing to reflect on, but this man, whom nature, religion, every [s]acred tie obliges me to re[s]pect and love: this very man is a libertine, and an infidel. He came [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] one Sunday morning into the library, where I was reading. "Well my pretty ro[s]e-bud," [s]aid he, for he generally calls me by [s]ome [s]uch unaccountable name; "What are your [s]tudies?" "Rowe's letters," I replied. "What do you read [s]uch [s]tuff as that for?" cried he, pulling the book out of my hand, " 'Tis time enough for you to read [s]uch serious non[s]en[s]e [s]ome forty or fifty years hence, and here is that "[s]tupid fellow Harvey too," continued he, taking up a book that lay upon the table. "Why child, the[s]e ridiculous books are enough to turn your head; they might have done well enough in a convent, but [s]urely you may find [s]omething more amu[s]ing in this collection." "I read the[s]e [s]erious authors by choice, [s]ir," [s]aid I. "You have a [s]trange ta[s]te for a girl of your age then," he replied, "but I don't believe you [s]peak as you think. Come tell me hone[s]tly, Meriel," continued he [s]itting, down be[s]ide me, "did you never get any novels or romances in the convent?" You may [s]uppo[s]e I [s]tared at him, for you know we never [s]aw a book of the kind, during the whole time we were together; of this I a[s][s]ured him: to which he replied; "then that ea[s]ily accounted for my ta[s]te." He then began to [s]peak of religion, and the [s]acred writings in a manner that made me tremble. At fir[s]t, I thought he meant only to try me; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] finding the more I oppo[s]ed his [s]entiments, the [s]tronger were the arguments he advanced to confute, as he [s]aid, "my fooli[s]h bigotry, to a [s]ubject which was not worthy the attention of any but old women and children." I ro[s]e from my [s]eat and bur[s]ting into tears, cried, "oh! [s]ir, if the[s]e are indeed your sentiments they [s]hock me to the [s]oul." "Come girl, come don't cry," [s]aid he, pulling me toward him; "you mu[s]t try to get the better of the[s]e [s]uper[s]titious notions, and learn to think and act for your[s]elf, unbia[s]ed by the prejudices of others." I could not an[s]wer for my tears. He took me in his arms and ki[s][s]ed me; but my [s]oul [s]hrunk back from his embrace. My mother ju[s]t then pa[s][s]ing the window, he left me and went into the garden to join her. I do not like this Mrs. Talbot, [s]o well as I did at fir[s]t; I [s]aw my father take a liberty with her yesterday when they thought they were unobserved. There was an impropriety in it, which made me [s]hudder; and a thought darted acro[s]s my mind which almo[s]t [s]tunned my faculties: [s]urely they cannot be [s]o very abandoned. Oh my poor mother! I fear, this too well explains the cau[s]e of your tears and dejection. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] May 5 th . It is as I [s]u[s]pected, Mrs. Talbot is an unworthy woman. This morning, I aro[s]e earlier than common, intending, the weather being [s]ine, to walk into the meadows, before breakfa[s]t, pa[s][s]ing my mother's chamber door I [s]aw it was partly open; and, looking in, I percieved my dear mother rai[s]ed upon her elbow in the bed, the tears [s]treaming down her face, and [s]obbing, as tho' her heart would break. Unable to re[s]train my[s]elf, I ru[s]hed into the room and ardently reque[s]ted to know the cau[s]e of her grief. She ha[s]tily endeavoured to dry her tears and compo[s]e her countenance, a[s][s]ured me that nothing particular was the matter, but that [s]he often was [s]eized with tho[s]e involuntary fits of weeping, for which [s]he could a[s][s]ign no cau[s]e. "Oh! my dear mother," [s]aid I, "you cannot thus deceive a child, who loves you as I do. Long have I noticed the anxiety that weighs heavy at your heart, and preys upon your [s]pirits. Can you, do you think your daughter unworthy to be tru[s]ted with your [s]orrows. Believe me I will trea[s]ure them in my bosom as a [s]acred depo[s]it, and having ea[s]ed your labouring brea[s]t of the painful burthen will pour into it the balm of con[s]olation." "My dear girl, my only comforter, [s]aid my mother; [s]eek not to know what will only [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] make you unhappy, I cannot be more [s]o than I am already, [s]aid I, for how is it po[s][s]ible I can be at peace when you are the victim of concealed angui[s]h? "Oh! my child, [s]aid [s]he, I cannot explain to you the nature of my [s]orrows, without acu[s]ing one, whom it is your duty to re[s]pect, I mu[s]t not make my child di[s]pi[s]e her father;" "I will not despise him, I replied. If he can injure goodness like your's I will pity and pardon him, and pray to heaven to turn his heart." But where is my father. He has been out all night [s]aid my mother. While you were at Mr. Rowley's ye[s]terday, he went out and has not returned [s]ince. Ju[s]t then I heard a chai[s]e drive up to the door and looking out [s]aw my father alight and hand out Mrs Talbot; the my[s]tery is unravelled [s]aid I; "go, [s]aid my mother, dry your eyes and appear at breakfa[s]t as compo[s]ed as you can; do not let them have the triumph of [s]eeing how much they di[s]tre[s]s us. I did as I was de[s]ired, but when I entered the breakfa[s]t parlour, I felt a glow of indignation flu[s]h my cheek, and I could hardly give them the compliments of the morning with any [s]teadine[s]s of accent. Mrs. Talbot fixed her penetrating black eyes upon my face; I darted at her a look of anger, [s]he immediately ca[s]t them down, turned pale and [s]eemed much agitated; but whether it was with anger or [s]en[s]ibility I cannot determine. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] May 6th, 1775 . This Mrs. Talbot is a wonderful woman: her conduct is an inexplicable riddle; her character undefinable. With [s]ome of the fine[s]t [s]entiments that can elevate human nature, and with the power to act up to tho[s]e sentiments, [s]he has [s]unk her[s]elf upon a level the meane[s]t of her [s]ex. I at one and the [s]ame moment admire, love, pity and dispise her: but I will inform you of the cau[s]e of the[s]e contradictory [s]entiments. Ye[s]terday afternoon as my mother, Mrs. Talbot and my[s]elf were at tea, my father came in from a walk and throwing a folded paper into Mrs. Talbot's lap, told her he had met with a travelling pedlar and had brought her a pre[s]ent. She unfolded the paper, and [s]eeing a piece of fine chintz, enquired if there was enough for two gowns. "No," [s]aid my father, "I bought but one." "Then certainly, Sir, you did not mean it for me; only your politene[s]s leads you to offer it; permit me to re[s]ign it to the proper owner," laying it on my mother's knee. "Then, you refu[s]e my pre[s]ent, Kate," [s]aid my father [s]ternly. "I do indeed," [s]ays [s]he, with firmne[s]s, "and am re[s]olved on no account whatever to accept another obligation at your hands. I have too long forgot what was due to this re[s]pectable family, to your honour, and to my[s]elf. It is time to amend [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] and fly from errors, which originated in duplicity on one [s]ide, and weakne[s]s on the other. I have wrote to my [s]i[s]ter, that I [s]hall leave Woodbine Cot to-morrow, and nothing [s]hall prevent my putting my design in execution." During the time Mrs. Talbot was [s]peaking, my father [s]tood like one petrefied; my mother's colour went and came alternately red and pale. Indeed I was afraid [s]he would have fainted. At length [s]he a[s][s]umed [s]ufficient courage to a[s]k with tolerable compo[s]ure, how long [s]he had formed this re[s]olution, which appeared as [s]udden as it was unexpected. "Oh! my dear madam," [s]aid [s]he, "it is not a [s]udden re[s]olution, I have long had it in my mind, but always wanted fortitude to execute my re[s]olves; it is much ea[s]ier to ru[s]h into guilt, than to recede from it, and I have long learnt to dete[s]t my own vices without making one attempt to eradicate them. This dear young lady has compleated a reformation, which your gentlene[s]s and virtue had begun. Believe me, madam, had I [s]ooner known, how very amiable you were, I [s]hould never have injured you; but I was a stranger to your goodne[s]s till it was too late to recall my error. When Mi[s]s Howard returned from France, it was impo[s][s]ible to be an inmate in the hou[s]e with her and not love her. From loving virtue in others we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] by degrees wi[s]h to po[s][s]e[s]s it our[s]elves; because we are con[s]cious that without it we cannot be re[s]pected or e[s]teemed by the worthy part of mankind. I wi[s]hed to obtain Mi[s]s Howard's friend[s]hip; but I knew I was unworthy of the ble[s][s]ing. From that moment I determined, if I could not merit her e[s]teem, I would at lea[s]t avoid her di[s]plea[s]ure and contempt; but alas!" continued [s]he, "I am too late; [s]he already de[s]pi[s]es me, and I feel I have not even a claim to her pity." "For heaven's [s]ake! what does all this mean," [s]aid my father, "who dares treat you with contempt, or in[s]ult you with their pity?" "No one, Mr. Howard," [s]he replied calmly; "I only [s]ay it is what I have a right to expect; if you remember I told you a few days [s]ince that I was determined no longer to lead a life of infamy; you thought me then in je[s]t; perhaps you may think [s]o [s]till; believe me, 'tis of little con[s]equence to me, what opinion you may form of my conduct; I am anxious only to obtain the pardon of the[s]e ladies, of who[s]e merits I could wi[s]h you to be [s]en[s]ible, before you have inevitably de[s]troyed both their happine[s]s and your own." She then ro[s]e from her [s]eat, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] taking one of my mother's hands, and one of mine, pre[s][s]ed them alternately to her lips, and bur[s]ting into a fre[s]h flood of tears, left the room. My father followed her, and I heard them [s]peak very high in the adjoining apartment, but could di[s]tingui[s]h nothing that pa[s]t excepting the words, "never whil[s]t I have life," which were pronounced by Mrs. Talbot, as [s]he went up [s]tairs, where [s]he locked her[s]elf into her own room. My father went immediately out, nor was he returned while I [s]at up with my mother, who [s]eemed more melancholy than ever, and not inclined for conver[s]ation. This morning when we met at breakfa[s]t a heavy cloud hung on my father's brow. Mrs. Talbot was not come down. I went up to call her. The door was open. I went into the room; but found, by a letter which lay on the table, that [s]he had left the hou[s]e at four o'clock in the morning. The cloaths and other presents, which [s]he had received from my father, were packed up in a [s]mall trunk and directed for me. In her letter to my mother, [s]he takes a long adieu, and [s]ays there is not the lea[s]t probability of our ever meeting again, as [s]he [s]hould leave England almo[s]t immediately. It is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe the rage of my father, when he found [s]he was really gone. He [s]wore we had treated her ill, or [s]he never would have taken [s]uch a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] resolution. In vain we prote[s]ted our innocence. He vented his rage in the mo[s]t ungentleman-like terms, on my dear patient mother, who could return nothing but tears. He is now taking his u[s]ual walk. I hope, when he returns, he will be calmer. I am weary, my dear Celia, and can write no more. Farewell. May good angels guard you. MERIEL. MRS. TALBOT to LUCETTA ASKHAM. -  Woodbine Cot May 5 th , 1775. I found my[s]elf at the conclu[s]ion of my la[s]t letter, my dear [s]i[s]ter, totally unable to continue the [s]ubject, which I ju[s]t hinted to you. I wi[s]hed you to conceive the whole without de[s]cending to particulars, yet how is that po[s][s]ible. At this moment you think me a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] virtuous, but unfortunate woman; you al[s]o think Mr. Howard the mo[s]t benevolent, mo[s]t di[s]inter[s]ted of men: ah! my dear sister, how have you been deceived. But to make you under[s]tand more perfectly, I mu[s]t go back to the time when I lo[s]t Mr. Talbot. A [s]tranger in London, alone unconnected with the world, deprived of the means of [s]upport by my hu[s]band's death. I was revolving in my mind what plan to pur[s]ue in future; when chance introduced me to Mr. Howard. My dre[s]s declared me a widow. He paid me innumerable little attentions, whenever we met at the hou[s]e of an attorney, with who[s]e lady I was intimate, and at length from having frequently called with my friend, who was employed to [s]ettle my late hu[s]band's affairs, he a[s][s]umed the privilege of vi[s]iting by him[s]elf. To you, who know him [s]o well, I need not de[s]cribe either the graces of his per[s]on, or his in[s]inuating address. Perfect ma[s]ter of the art of deception; he conceals under the ma[s]k of integrity and honour every vice which can di[s]grace human nature: with that ver[s]atality of temper which makes him appear every thing to every body; with the religious he is grave and solemn; with the gay cheerful and affable, with the [s]plenetic he can rail at the vices and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] follies of mankind, and with the libertine practice tho[s]e vices him[s]elf: tho' where it is his intere[s]t he can appear devout, yet no man ever concieved a more contemptuous opinion of religion, or [s]trove with more diabolical earne[s]tne[s]s to corrupt the young and inexperienced heart. When fir[s]t I was introduced to him, I was told he was a married man. What was my wonder, then, when after a few vi[s]its he profe[s][s]ed a pa[s][s]ion for me. I combated his [s]ophi[s]tical arguments as well as my weak rea[s]oning would permit; but alas! I lo[s]t ground in every argument. At length he told me as a [s]ecret, which nothing but the mo[s]t violent pa[s][s]ion could have extorted from him, that he never did, nor ever could love his wife; that he had married her [s]olely to oblige his father, who was [s]ince dead, and that [s]he was a cold, inanimate woman, fit only for the frigid rules, and [s]olemn rites of a convent. Then with the mo[s]t [s]olemn affeverations, he called heaven to witne[s]s that I was the only woman he ever loved; and called down the mo[s]t heavy maledictions on his head, if he [s]hould ever for[s]ake me. Lucetta, I was infatuated; I thought him the tendere[s]t, be[s]t of men, and mourn'd a fate which had united him to a woman he could not love. Poverty and di[s]tre[s]s surrounded me. Mr. Howard offered a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] settlement of fifty pounds a year and to take me into his family, as a relation of his own. My [s]i[s]ter, do you now concieve the depth of my [s]hame. I accepted his offer, and a letter was di[s]patched, to let Mrs. Howard know, he had met with a relation, who[s]e circumstances were rather embarra[s][s]ed and whom he had invited home, as he thought [s]he would prove an agreeable addition to their family. The return of po[s]t brought [s]uch an an[s]wer as might be expected from a woman, who[s]e chief [s]tudy was to plea[s]e and render her hu[s]band happy. When I arrived at Woodbine Cot, Mrs. Howard recieved me with a mixture of politene[s]s and affection. Never [s]hall I forget the [s]en[s]ations, which pervaded my bo[s]om, when entering a neat parlour [s]he ro[s]e to welcome me. Astonishment riveted me to the [s]pot; unable to [s]peak or move, I [s]unk into the neare[s]t chair, and had nearly fainted. Figure to your[s]elf, my [s]i[s]ter, a woman, [s]carcely thirty years old, elegantly formed, with a countenance animated and prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ing; her fine blue eyes beaming tenderne[s]s on the cruel betrayer of her peace. Think you hear her in accents [s]oft as the mu[s]ic of the [s]pheres, by turns cheering and comforting the very woman who had robbed her of her hu[s]band's affections. And [s]urely then, you will not wonder, if unable to [s]tifle my emotions, I gave way to a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] flood of tears. "You are too much affected, my dear madam," [s]aid Mrs. Howard, taking my hand. "Do not I be[s]eech you give way to immoderate grief: when misfortunes are irremidiable it is our duty to [s]ubmit without repining: but I flatter myself, the united attentions of my dear Mr. Howard, and my[s]elf, will by degrees re[s]tore your tranquility. In the mean time, I hope you will con[s]ider your[s]elf at home, and be a[s][s]ured, we [s]hall think our[s]elves happy in being able in the lea[s]t to contribute to your ea[s]e or felicity." She then led me to an appartment, which had been prepared for me, and left me, to that repo[s]e which con[s]cious guilt rendered me incapable of enjoying. The more I knew of this amiable woman, the greater cau[s]e I found for admiration and re[s]pect. She being naturally of an open di[s]po[s]ition, I was in the cour[s]e of our intimacy, made acquainted with the mo[s]t material circum[s]tances of her life: and from her I learnt that [s]he had brought a very handsome fortune to Mr. Howard; and that they had married contrary to the advice of their friends on both [s]ides, as they had formed different views for them: but, [s]aid [s]he, with a [s]igh, "We thought love for each other would compen[s]ate for the privation of the [s]ociety of our other friends." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] I had not been long in this family, before I di[s]covered, that I was not the only woman, who [s]hared Mr. Howard's attention. He was neither careful to avoid [s]u[s]picion, nor delicate in the choice of his companions, as almost every female [s]ervant in the family, who was not proof again[s]t flattering vows and pre[s]ents of finery, had at [s]ome time or other attracted her ma[s]ter's notice. The amiable [s]uffering wife bore all with angelic patience, nor ever once breathed a murmur. I had the [s]atisfaction to find that my remonstrances had [s]ome effect, and he became more circum[s]pect in his behaviour. I could al[s]o at any time re[s]train him from the pursuit of any new amour by threatning to leave him, and I flattered my[s]elf, that this in [s]ome mea[s]ure attoned to Mrs. Howard for the injuries I did her. In this manner I continued in the family near three years, when I found an evident alteration in the conduct of my ho[s]te[s]s. Her manner was cold and di[s]tant; [s]he often avoided my [s]ociety and retired to her apartment, where I have [s]urprized her weeping. Con[s]cious guilt would not permit me to enquire the cau[s]e of her uneasiness, as I naturally imagined [s]he had discovered my improper intimacy with her husband: but one day while we were at Bri[s]tol, I overheard a conver[s]ation between them which determined me to quit a life, at once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] [s]o repugnant to honour, humanity and religion. It was one morning, as I was preparing to enter the breakfa[s]t room, the door of which was not quite [s]hut, when I heard Mr. Howard in a high key reproaching his wife for not behaving [s]o kindly as formerly to me. I wi[s]hed to know in what manner Mrs. Howard [s]poke of me, and therefore descended to the meanne[s]s of li[s]tening. "My dear, Mr. Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "how is it possible for me to behave with cordiality to a woman who I am well convinced has u[s]urped my place in your affections; and tho' I am willing acknowledge the many amiable traits in her character, I cannot be blind to that one error, which embitters every hour of my life; nor am I mi[s]tre[s]s of [s]ufficient dissimulation, to wear the face of friend[s]hip where my heart feels only di[s]like, nay almo[s]t disgust. I will not [s]cruple to confe[s]s, I once did e[s]teem her: but pardon the expre[s][s]ion, if I [s]ay, the heart that loves virtue for its own [s]ake, can never form acquaintance with vice. We may pity, but we mu[s]t de[s]pi[s]e." "Hold madam," [s]aid he, "or I [s]hall be led to [s]uppo[s]e you de[s]pi[s]e me." "No, Mr. Howard," [s]aid [s]he, with a firm animated voice, "you are the cho[s]en friend of my heart, the father of my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] children, the hu[s]band of my affections, I have promi[s]ed to love, to honour, and obey you, and heaven is my witne[s]s, I never have failed in one of tho[s]e points: to cea[s]e to love you is impo[s][s]ible; to obey you is the plea[s]ure of my life: but, pardon me, if your own conduct has forced me unwillingly to own, I can no longer honour you; my peace has been broken by your ill humour, my fortune di[s][s]ipated by your extravagance, nay lavi[s]hed on the mo[s]t di[s]olute of my [s]ex, until your family is reduced to the mo[s]t mortifying circumstances: my child, my beloved Meriel obliged to be educated far from me; becau[s]e her father's morals were too vitiated to be a proper object for the contemplation of a young and innocent mind." Here [s]he wept, and Mr. Howard not being able to make a ju[s]t defence, flew into a violent pa[s][s]ion, as was his u[s]ual cu[s]tom, [s]wore [s]he was a mo[s]t unacountabIe woman, and wondered at his own patience in bearing with her [s]o long. This unde[s]erved reproach awakened her [s]tifled pa[s][s]ion, and [s]he an[s]wered with intrepidity. "No, [s]ir, it is my patience is to be wondered at, but do not irritate me, beyond the possibility of [s]ubmitting any longer, I fear I have been wrong in [s]o long bearing my injuries in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] [s]ilence; perhaps, you think, becau[s]e I appeared blind to your immoral conduct, I countenanced it. Let me undeceive you. Mrs. Talbot [s]hould not [s]o long have remained under the [s]ame roof with me, had I not feared, that by depriving her of an a[s]ylum, I [s]hould injure her reputation and drive her into an inhuman world, where one fal[s]e [s]tep is never forgiven, and [s]he might have [s]unk into the lowe[s]t aby[s]s of vice and infamy. I flattered my[s]elf my gentlene[s]s might have reclaimed her. I knew, alas! too well, the incon[s]tancy of your nature, and had determined that when for[s]aken by you, [s]he [s]hould not want a friend to [s]natch her from everlasting ruin." I was [s]o overcome by this generous declaration, that I was forced to catch hold of the ballu[s]trade of the [s]tairs, to prevent falling. A [s]udden [s]ickne[s]s came over me, and I could not di[s]tinctly hear the remainder of their conver[s]ation; but, thank heaven, I profited [s]o much from what I had heard, that I re[s]olved no longer, by my pre[s]ence, to wound a heart [s]o replete with benevolence toward me. I did not enter the parlour; but returned to my own apartment; and, [s]ending an apology for not appearing at breakfa[s]t, revolved in my own mind a variety of [s]chemes, for my future [s]ub[s]i[s]tence; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] could think on nothing that appeared in the lea[s]t probable of [s]ucce[s]s. That afternoon Mi[s]s Howard arrived from France. Had my mind been ever [s]o depraved it mu[s]t have returned to virtue after an acquaintance with this dear girl; I therefore became more firm in my re[s]olves; and having formed an acquaintance with an elderly lady, of who[s]e [s]en[s]e and goodne[s]s of heart I had a very high opinion; I determined to di[s]clo[s]e every particular of my [s]ituation to her, and a[s]k her advice in what manner I [s]hould proceed. She heard me with attention, and was friendly enough not to attempt to paliate my errors. She placed my conduct in a proper light and encouraged the remor[s]e which was already awakened in my bo[s]om. She then opened a [s]cene of comfort to my di[s]tre[s][s]ed imagination, and having advi[s]ed me to return with the family to Woodbine Cot, to prevent any ill natured remarks among our acquaintance, and afterwards to pur[s]ue the plan which [s]he had laid down. Yet, will you believe it, when I returned to this place I felt my re[s]olution [s]lacken, and found I was relap[s]ing into my former errors; but this morning the dear amiable Meriel has awakened my [s]leeping con[s]cience, and I am determined to leave the family immediately. I went into the garden after breakfa[s]t and found her weeping in a little arbour. "In [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] tears, my dear little girl," [s]aid I. "Have I not cau[s]e for tears," [s]he replied, "is not my beloved mother unhappy?" "Unhappy!" [s]aid I, with an accent of [s]urpri[s]e, willing to try if [s]he was acquainted with the cau[s]e. She fixed her expre[s][s]ive eyes on my face, and replied emphatically; "[s]urely I need not tell you, Mrs. Talbot, that [s]he is very unhappy; for you profe[s]s your[s]elf her friend, and friend[s]hip is quick [s]ighted in di[s]cerning the [s]orrows of the per[s]on e[s]teemed: true friend[s]hip is al[s]o eagerly anxious to remove the cau[s]e of grief from the bo[s]om of tho[s]e they love, though by [s]o doing, they plant a thorn in their own." I could not an[s]wer her; I did not even attempt it; but pre[s][s]ing her hand in [s]ilence retired to another part of the garden. On Tue[s]day morning, at four o'clock, I [s]hall expect you will [s]end a man and hor[s]e for me. I [s]hall come but poorly provided with ca[s]h, as I am re[s]olved to leave my settlement behind me, as likewi[s]e every pre[s]ent of value, which I have received. I will not impoveri[s]h the family which I have already irreparably injured. But do not think I [s]hall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] come to throw my[s]elf on you for [s]upport. No, my [s]i[s]ter, I have the abilities nece[s][s]ary to earn my [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, and they [s]hall be exerted. I [s]hall [s]tay only one night with you, and then proceed to my kind friend at Bri[s]tol. As to the remainder of my plan, if I [s]ucceed to my wi[s]h, you [s]hall again hear from me; if not, I [s]hall [s]ink at once into total oblivion. Farewell, my [s]i[s]ter, forget my errors; remember only my penitence, and let me [s]hare your prayers, that it may be [s]incere and la[s]ting. C. TALBOT. MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE. -  Woodbine Cot May 7 th , 1775. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] My father is more compo[s]ed, than I could imagine po[s][s]ible in the ab[s]ence of Mrs. Talbot; but he is [s]till gloomy and un[s]ocial with my mother; however, I cannot but flatter my[s]elf that time, and her unwearied a[s][s]iduities, will regain his affections; and was that to be the happy re[s]ult of her patience and forbearance, how great would be our felicity. Mi[s]s Dolly Pringle has ju[s]t called to solicit my mother's leave for my drinking tea with her. It is but [s]eldom I am permitted to go without the boundaries of our garden, except to accompany my father or mother in a retired walk; but for a wonder, I am this afternoon to be tru[s]ted unaccompanied by either. I cannot think what my father is afraid of, that he [s]hould be [s]o aver[s]e to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] my taking any kind of innocent recreation. I am [s]ure, if I know my own heart, I have no improper wi[s]hes lurking there; yet he is always [s]aying [s]uch [s]trange things about love and lovers that it [s]eems he would be angry if a man was only to [s]peak civil to me. Dolly knew this odd way of his, and [s]o did not tell him that her brother was expected to come from London for a few days, and mo[s]t likely would arrive this afternoon. "I am [s]ure," [s]aid [s]he to me, "you will like Harry va[s]tly, and if he is not [s]mitten, I [s]hall be [s]urpri[s]ed. Pray Mi[s]s," continued [s]he, "were you never in love?" "In love," [s]aid I; "really I don't rightly comprehend what you mean by the word." "La! that is va[s]tly odd; but never mind my dear; half an hour's conver[s]ation with my brother will explain it better than I could in a whole day." "But why Mi[s]s Pringle, mu[s]t your brother talk to me of love; I [s]hould [s]uppo[s]e there were many more intere[s]ting [s]ubjects." "La! Mi[s]s," [s]he replied [s]omething tartly, "you talk like a child I think; why what [s]hould a gallant young man [s]ay to a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] beautiful young lady, but that he adored her; or when did you ever read of a young gentleman being left to entertain a lady, for half an hour, but he fell at her feet, called her a divinity, and vowed to love her while the vital fluid warmed his heart." "Ble[s]s me!" [s]aid I, "I declare I never read [s]uch a thing in my life." "Surely then," [s]he replied with a look of [s]urpri[s]e; "you never read the divine hi[s]tory of lady Frances and lady Caroline, or the loves of Edward and Harriet?" "No, indeed," [s]aid I, "I have never even heard of them." "Oh! my dear girl, then," cried [s]he, in a [s]ort of exta[s]y; "you have a plea[s]ure to come, of which at pre[s]ent you can form no idea: I will lend you the books; but you mu[s]t not let your father [s]ee them." And that you may believe me Celia, I [s]hall not; for he is always ready enough to abridge me of any thing that can afford me plea[s]ure. As to my dear mother, I am [s]ure [s]he will gratify every laudable wi[s]h of my heart; and [s]ure if Mi[s]s Pringle has recieved [s]o much plea[s]ure in the peru[s]al of them, they cannot be improper books; at any rate, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] when one hears a great deal about a thing, one naturally longs to [s]ee it. But after all it appears to me very odd that a man and woman cannot conver[s]e together without making love: I think it is a very fooli[s]h idea, and in my opinion a very fallacious one; for now I remember, Mr. Verdome travelled all the way from Bologne with me, and never [s]aid a [s]yllable about love or adoration. To be [s]ure Mr. Verdome is almo[s]t fifty years old; but I [s]hould not [s]uppo[s]e that would make any great difference. May 8th . Well, to be [s]ure I do begin to be a little better plea[s]ed with the [s]ociety of our neighbours than I was at fir[s]t; indeed I feel my heart much lighter [s]ince Mrs. Talbot left us, for I [s]ee my dear mother looks happier; and if [s]he is happy I [s]hall be [s]o too. I [s]pent a very agreeable evening at Mrs. Pringle's, who[s]e [s]on arrived, ju[s]t as we had [s]at down to tea; I thought him a very plea[s]ing young man. He is an en[s]ign in the army, and has a military, manly countenance. I know not how it was, but whether from what Dolly had [s]aid in the morning, or whether from my not being accu[s]tomed to the [s]ociety of men; yet I felt my[s]elf awkward and embarre[s][s]ed; however, as Mr. Pringle [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] did not [s]ay any thing particular, I [s]oon recovered my[s]elf, tho' when Mrs. Pringle and her daughter left the room for a few moments, I was frightened to death left he [s]hould make love to me, and you know, if he had I [s]hould not have known what to [s]ay to him. This fear, I am [s]ure, made me look like a fool; for I felt my face glow like [s]carlet. I dare [s]ay he thought me an idiot: well, it is of little con[s]equence to me what he thought: only you know one don't like [s]trangers to form an unju[s]t opinion of our mental faculties. Mi[s]s Pringle lent me the books which [s]he promi[s]ed: I did not dare to read any before I went to bed, as my father often walks round the hou[s]e to [s]ee if all the lights are out; and if he had caught me reading, he would have immediately taken the books from me, for he has lately taken it into his head that I read too much, and that I [s]hall be good for nothing, if I am [s]uffered to pore [s]o much over a parcel of mu[s]ty old authors. So, I locked up my new acqui[s]itions in my clo[s]et, and aro[s]e two hours earlier this morning to peru[s]e it. Realy, Celia, the[s]e young ladies who write [s]o much, and [s]o prettily to each other, mu[s]t be very amiable and lovely, for you mu[s]t know the whole book is in letters, it is indeed a charming [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] hi[s]tory; you cannot think how much I cried whil[s]t I was reading. Surely, [s]aid I, at one time, it mu[s]t be a [s]ad thing to be in love; and yet unhappy as it makes many, every body [s]eems to be affected with this [s]trange pa[s][s]ion; it appears to be their whole bu[s]ine[s]s. But my father is gone to walk and my mother retired to her apartment, which [s]he does almo[s]t every afternoon; [s]o, I may now [s]natch an hour or two to read a little more. May 9th . Well, Celia, would you believe it, after having cried my[s]elf almo[s]t blind about the the di[s]tre[s][s]es of the dear ladies, who[s]e history I have been reading, I was agreeably surprised to find, in the end, all parties were made happy. I declare I was very much delighted, and cannot [s]ay but I [s]hould like to go into more company, and [s]ee a little more of life; for then perhaps I [s]hould meet with [s]ome [s]uch charming women as lady Frances and lady Caroline. Celia, I might al[s]o be admired by [s]ome fine gentleman, as they were; for I find country girls are as much engaged with love and lovers as the great ladies.

Perhaps the[s]e were the kind my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] father meant, when he talked about romances and novels; but yet that cannot be, as this is a real hi[s]tory, the characters drawn from life. Mi[s]s Pringle has promi[s]ed to lend me [s]ome more of the [s]ame [s]ort, and [s]ome plays; [s]o I think I [s]hall pa[s]s my time much more agreeably than before; tho' do not think I mean to neglect tho[s]e authors our dear [s]i[s]ter Con[s]tance [s]o [s]trenuou[s]ly recommended to my notice. No, no, my friend, I will not neglect the u[s]eful [s]tudies of hi[s]tory, geography, and far more necessary duty of public and private devotion; and now I am on the [s]ubject of devotion, I mu[s]t ju[s]t mention [s]omething in my father's character, which is to me unaccountable. Tho' he talked to me in the pro[s]ane [s]tile I have related in a former letter, yet to my mother and the families who vi[s]it us, he pretends to have a high veneration for religion and religious [s]ubjects, and as we live a con[s]iderable di[s]tance from the church, he makes a practice of reading the morning [s]ervice to the family; tho' perhaps the moment he has clo[s]ed the prayer book, [s]hould the mo[s]t tri[s]ling thing happen to ruffle his temper, he will bur[s]t into fits of ungovernable rage, and [s]wear in [s]uch a horrible manner, that I [s]hudder to hear him. There is a little boy, whom he has taken into the family, and whom he takes great pains to teach his catechi[s]m, &c. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] I have [s]een him whip the poor lad unmercifully for innocently humming a [s]ong tune on a Sunday morning, when he him[s]elf lives in the con[s]tant breach of almo[s]t every duty the chri[s]tian religion lays days down for our observation and direction. Are not the[s]e inconsistencies, Celia? Surely the father of children, the ma[s]ter of a family, [s]hould [s]et a good example, or he can never expect others to attend to duties he [s]o evidently appears to di[s]regard. My dear old nur[s]e, Deborah, arrived yesterday, from a vi[s]it [s]he has been paying her friends ever [s]ince our return from the continent. She enquired when I had heard from you; de[s]ires you will not forget her. Of this I a[s][s]ured her, [s]he need not be afraid. Her return is another [s]ource of comfort to me, as my mother [s]ays [s]he [s]hall continue in the family as long as [s]he plea[s]es, and you know the affection I have contracted for her, from her attendance on me the whole time I was abroad, indeed I con[s]ider her almo[s]t in a maternal light, her fidelity and attachment to our family has been ever un[s]haken. Mi[s]s Pringle called this afternoon, and we walked in the garden together near an hour, during which time [s]he told me her brother was greatly [s]truck with my per[s]on, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] and that he had told his mother, if he thought I would return his pa[s][s]ion, he [s]hould immediately relinqui[s]h the idea he had formed of marrying a woman, to whom the whole family had the greate[s]t di[s]like, as [s]he was ignorant, low born and without fortune. "How happy [s]hall I be my dear Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "to call you [s]i[s]ter." "Ble[s]s me," [s]aid I, "how can you talk [s]o, you know I mu[s]t not think of li[s]tening to a lover without my father's permi[s][s]ion." "Your father indeed," cried [s]he laughing, "I wonder what your dear little [s]imple head will fancy next: why child, he would forbid me the hou[s]e if he only [s]u[s]pected [s]uch a thing; and you know my dear Meriel," ([s]he continned in a [s]oft [s]oothing accent) "you know, we are bo[s]om friends and [s]worn [s]i[s]ters and it would be very hard, you know, to be [s]eparated, perhaps forever." "Indeed Mi[s]s Pringle," [s]aid I, "my heart feels grateful for the friend[s]hip you profe[s]s for me, and I [s]hould be very [s]orry to be deprived of your [s]ociety." "Well, then my dear," [s]aid [s]he, "take this letter and don't let either your father or your mother [s]ee it." I would have refu[s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] the letter, as I feared it would be improper to take it; but my father ju[s]t then entering the garden, I dreaded his anger which is awakened at the mo[s]t in[s]igni[s]icant trifles, and is always impetuous: [s]o I ha[s]tily put it in my pocket. When we returned to the hou[s]e and Mi[s]s Pringle was gone, he cried petti[s]hly to my mother; "what does that girl do [s]o often here? I [s]hall have Meriel [s]poiled by her non[s]en[s]ical chatter; be[s]ides I will lay a guinea there is an intrigue of [s]ome [s]ort contriving between them; I never knew two girls allowed to be [s]o much together but they hatched mi[s]chief." "If you do not like Dolly Pringle," replied my mother, "we will try to drop her acquaintance, but you mu[s]t con[s]ider, Mr. Howard, Meriel mu[s]t have [s]ome [s]ociety." "Why, pray what society would [s]he have," [s]aid he, "are not you always with her, and has [s]he not plenty of needle-work to do? let her [s]tick clo[s]e to that, and [s]he won't want to be gadding and go[s][s]iping: [s]he is at pre[s]ent a [s]tranger to the world, and the le[s]s [s]he knows of it the better." This unkindne[s]s does not grieve me as it would if I loved him; but it gives me pain to [s]ee how much it affects my mother. I [s]at down to [s]upper in [s]ilence, and when it was fini[s]hed, retired as u[s]ual to my own [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] room, where I hai[s]tily broke the [s]eal of my letter, and found it wrote in [s]uch a charming [s]tyle, [s]o tender, [s]o lively, I read it over half a dozen times, but could not determine whether to an[s]wer it or not. Good night Celia, it is eleven o'clock, and I dare not write a moment longer. MERIEL. MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE. -  Woodbine Cot June 17 th . I have been very unhappy, Celia, [s]ince I wrote la[s]t; indeed I did not know whether I [s]hould be permitted to write to you again: nor could I now enjoy that satisfaction if good Deborah had not procured me pens, ink, and [s]ome paper; which [s]he did on conditions of [s]eeing all I wrote; and I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] have left my bed at the early hour of four, to pour forth my complaints to my dear Celia. In my la[s]t I told you I had recieved a letter from Mr. Pringle, declaring himself my lover: I will own I was very much plea[s]ed with it. Tho' at fir[s]t I he[s]itated to an[s]wer it, yet, when I read a few more books, which Mi[s]s Dolly Pringle [s]ent me by means of our dairy maid, and I found that none of the young ladies mentioned in them ever he[s]itated at an[s]wering their lover's letters; I ventured to write a few lines in reply to one which he [s]ent me reque[s]ting me to meet him one night after the family were in bed, and in which he told me, Lettice the maid would come and let me know, when all was quiet in the hou[s]e, and that [s]he would go with me to the place he had appointed for our meeting. Indeed, Celia, I did not think any harm; [s]o I wrote and told him if his sister would come with him, I would meet him, for I wi[s]hed very much to [s]ee Dolly, and I knew I [s]hould not have another opportunity very [s]oon. When we met, his manner was [s]o tender, his language [s]o pathetic, and the tender attentions of his [s]i[s]ter [s]o like what I had read, that I could not help confe[s][s]ing that I pitied him, and that if it would in the lea[s]t alleviate his [s]uffering, I would meet him there again. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] We went on thus for [s]ome time, when overpowered one evening by his entreaties, I consented to go with him to London, where he promi[s]ed to marry me. Dear, dear, Celia, I tremble even now, when I think of what followed. The next day we had ju[s]t done breakfast, when an elderly gentleman who has a great regard for my father and mother called, and telling the latter he had [s]omething very particular to [s]ay to her, they walked together into the garden. When they returned, I [s]aw my dear mother, oh! I [s]hall never forget it, I [s]aw her look extremely angry, her eyes darted at me [s]uch indignant glances, that my very [s]oul felt humbled within me, I could have fallen at her feet and intreated to know the cau[s]e of her anger: for indeed, Celia, I did not think, if [s]he had even discovered my corre[s]pondence with young Pringle, that [s]he would have been [s]o very much offended, e[s]pecially as I could appeal for a precedent, to the conduct of [s]o many amiable young ladies of even rank and fortune. But the moment Mr. Sutten was gone, [s]he a[s]ked me in a tone that rent my very heart, how I dared either to receive or write letters without her knowledge. Her anger overpowered me; [s]omething ro[s]e in my throat and prevented my [s]peaking, I thought I [s]hould have died with [s]orrow, when [s]he thus continued: "Unkind, ungenerous Meriel, thus to abu[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] the confidence your mother had placed in you. How, degenerate girl, have you dared to violate the laws of female delicacy, by openly avowing a pa[s][s]ion for a man to whom you are almo[s]t a [s]tranger, and even to make your[s]elf ridiculous by writing [s]uch letters to him as renders you the je[s]t of the whole village." "Oh! my dear mother," [s]aid I in a voice almo[s]t choaked with [s]obs; "indeed I did not think any harm." "Perhaps, Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, "had you [s]topped here, I might have forgiven you: but know, fal[s]e disembling girl, I have di[s]covered all your illicit plans, you have left your father's hou[s]e at hours, when mode[s]ty would have [s]hrunk to venture out, without a proper protector: and, to compleat your imprudence, this very night you had de[s]igned to quit a mother, whom you have pretended to love and respect, and to throw your[s]elf intirely into the power of a wretch, who regards you only as a vehicle, thro' which he may come at the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of your fortune." I fell at her feet and would have taken her hand; but [s]he [s]natched it from me, and and ri[s]ing from her [s]eat left me weeping on the ground. "Unworthy girl," [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he left the room, "go hide your[s]elf from my [s]ight, for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] you are become odious to me. Never, never, child, can you regain the confidence you have lo[s]t. I had flattered my[s]elf with finding in you a comforter and tender filial friend; but you have added another wound to a heart already lacerated by many forrows." When my mother was gone, I laid my head upon a chair and continued weeping. In this po[s]ition my father found me. "So, Mi[s]s," [s]aid he, [s]ternly, "I find you were for providing a hu[s]band for your[s]elf; you were re[s]olved to lo[s]e no time; but pray what will you [s]ay when I tell you this fine lover of your's is already married and has been [s]o the[s]e two years." "Married, [s]ir!" cried I, rai[s]ing my head. "Yes child, married, though his friends were unacquainted with it, but this morning I hear his wife is arrived from London, with one child, to [s]olicit that [s]upport which he has inhumanly refu[s]ed her." I made no an[s]wer, but returning my head to its reclining po[s]ture, continued weeping without intermission. "Ah! my poor little Meriel," [s]aid he, in a tone of voice more [s]oft than u[s]ual, "I am afraid this naughty man has made great havock with your heart; but, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] come, come, you [s]hall not wear the willow long, we will find another lover for you [s]oon." "Indeed, [s]ir, you mi[s]take the cau[s]e of my tears," [s]aid I. "It is not the lo[s]s of all the lovers in the world would grieve me half [s]o much as the fear of having forever forfeited my dear mother's affection." "Well, well," he replied, "don't let that vex you; if [s]he is unkind, I will endeavour to attone for it. To be [s]ure, [s]he is very rigid in her notions, but I dare [s]ay, when [s]he [s]ees you heartily repent your fault, [s]he will overlook it and love you as well as ever." He then left me, and I retired to my apartment, where Deborah told me my mother had been, and had carried all my pens, ink and paper away with her. Ever [s]ince [s]he has been cold, di[s]tant, nay almo[s]t unkind. Oh! my dear friend, what [s]hall I do to regain her affection, and convince her my repentance is [s]incere. Indeed, [s]he is to me the deare[s]t object upon earth, and her happiness [s]hall henceforth be my only [s]tudy. My father, when my mother is pre[s]ent, treats me with equal rigour; but, when we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] are alone, he is more gentle. Once or twice he has come to my apartment when [s]he was out, and even brought me [s]ome books; among which were [s]ome French novels. Even my brother has heard of my imprudence, and has wrote to my mother, enquiring the truth of the report; but he does not write as if he wi[s]hed it fal[s]e. I do not think he loves me; he had expected a legacy from Mrs. Mirvan, but the whole of her fortune being left to me, has created envy and jealousy in a bo[s]om, which I had once flattered my[s]elf I [s]hould find warm with friendly and fraternal love: and yet, Celia, if he did but know my heart, he would [s]ee he had no cau[s]e to envy me, except he [s]hould envy tho[s]e delightful [s]en[s]ations which I [s]hall feel when I come to the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my fortune, in [s]aying, brother, it is equally your's, command it to its utmo[s]t extent. Deborah has promi[s]ed me to get this letter conveyed to the neare[s]t po[s]t town. When you write, direct under cover to Mrs. Deborah Ellis, to remain at the office till called for, I dare not let my mother know I correspond with any one, lea[s]t [s]he [s]hould di[s]cover by what means I got the materials for writing, and poor Deborah would [s]uffer for her affectionate indulgence. I have no employment, no amu[s]ement, half [s]o agreeable as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] [s]cribling to my Celia, [s]o do not be impatient at the length of my letters. MERIEL. DEBORAH ELLIS to CELIA SHELBURNE. -  Woodbine Cot July 24th , 1775. DEAR MISS, I HOPE, you will pardon this freedom in a poor old woman, who is almo[s]t broken hearted, at an accident which has distracted the whole family. I hardly know how to tell you, becau[s]e I know you loved and valued my dear young lady; and [s]o indeed mu[s]t every one who knew her merits, tho' [s]ince [s]he has returned from France, I have heard her ridiculed for virtues which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] few, if any, endeavoured to imitate; and have [s]een her drawn into errors, by tho[s]e who, envying the [s]uperior qualities of her heart, endeavoured to bring her more on a level with them[s]elves. She [s]hewed me the la[s]t letter [s]he wrote to you; for it was only on condition of [s]eeing all [s]he wrote, that I [s]upplied her with the means of following her favourite amu[s]ement. The [s]ternne[s]s of her mother [s]till continued; and the poor young lady was abridged of the plea[s]ure of even walking beyond the limits of her father's garden. Mr. Howard's conduct, towards the dear girl, was altogether unaccountable, [s]ometimes har[s]h, unfeelingly reproaching her for her intended error; a method, in my poor humble opinion, by no means calculated to lead her to renounce the attachment, which hurried her to [s]o improper a [s]tep. At other times, he turned the whole affair into ridicule, and conver[s]ed with his daughter in a gay familiar manner; but tho' [s]he trembled at his anger, [s]he never expressed any [s]atisfaction in his company when good humoured; but rather wi[s]hed to indulge in [s]olitude and [s]tudy. About ten days [s]ince my mi[s]tre[s]s was [s]ent for, into Effex, to a relation, who was extremely ill. Mr. Howard did not accompany her: [s]he [s]et off in the afternoon, and he having procured a chai[s]e took Mi[s]s Meriel out for a ride, an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] indulgence [s]he had never experienced [s]ince her re[s]idence at this place. When [s]he returned [s]he [s]eemed very melancholy, and [s]aid her [s]pirits were much oppre[s][s]ed, and her mind harra[s][s]ed with terrors, for which [s]he could by no means account. She [s]upped with her father and retired at her u[s]ual hour. Mr. Howard [s]at up much later than common, and to my great [s]urpri[s]e, when I carried in his candle, he [s]eemed intoxicated, tho' he had been alone and [s]eldom gave way to exce[s][s]ive drinking, unle[s]s he had been led into it by company. I heard him go into his apartment, and then went to bed myself, where the fatigue of the day [s]oon made me fall a[s]leep. About two o'clock I was awakened by Mi[s]s. Howard, who in a shivering voice a[s]ked me if I had not heard a noi[s]e in her chamber, [s]aid, [s]he was greatly frightened, and would, if I plea[s]ed, [s]tay the remainder of the night with me. I helped her into bed; [s]he was cold as death, trembled exce[s][s]ivly, and [s]oonfell into a convul[s]ive hy[s]teric fit. Greatly alarmed, I called up one of my fellow [s]ervants, and by repeated applications of hart[s]horn, vinegar, &c. brought her to her[s]elf; [s]he would give no account of the cau[s]e of her fright; but seemed to mourn [s]ome heavy misfortune, and repeatedly wi[s]hed her[s]elf with you in the convent again. She re[s]ted but little all night, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] and the next morning was [s]o indi[s]po[s]ed as to be unable to ri[s]e, and was confined to her room for [s]everal [s]ucceeding days. One day after [s]he had ventured down [s]tairs; I a[s]ked leave to go a few miles, on [s]ome particular bu[s]ine[s]s, where I was detained all night, by rea[s]on of a violent [s]torm. Ri[s]ing early in the morning, and walking home before any of the family but the hou[s]e maids was [s]tirring, I went up immediately to [s]ee how my dear Mi[s]s Meriel was, for I had been very unea[s]y about her all night, knowing [s]he was terrified at thunder, and would not dare to expre[s]s her fears to her father, who would only have ridiculed them. On entering the room I was alarmed to find the bed in great di[s]order; many of her cloaths laying about the floor, the window open, and my beloved Mi[s]s Howard gone. Observing the [s]heets fa[s]tened to the bed-po[s]t, I naturally imagined [s]he mu[s]t have [s]lid by them into the garden, and looking out at the window I [s]aw one of her [s]hoes lay on the ground. Convinced now, of what before I had only conjectured, I gave a [s]cream of terror which alarmed my ma[s]ter, who came half dre[s][s]ed, pale and trembling into the room, exclaiming, "for God's [s]ake what is the noi[s]e about." "My young lady, [s]ir," [s]aid I, pointing to the window. "Eloped," [s]aid he, "with that villain, Pringle; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] here I [s]ware never again to [s]uffer"---"Oh, [s]ir!" cried I eagerly, "do not [s]ware to renounce her; I'd venture my life upon her innocence; I am [s]ure [s]ome vile means have been u[s]ed to draw her thus from her duty." "She is a little hypocrite, nur[s]e," [s]aid he, "and will make her[s]elf friends wherever [s]he goes, till [s]he is found out. I [s]uppo[s]e [s]he will trump up [s]ome fine [s]tory about ill u[s]age, or [s]ome devili[s]h thing or other. I wi[s]h to my [s]oul [s]he had never left the convent; this will go near to break her mother's heart." About noon Mrs. Howard returned. It is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe her angui[s]h when informed of her daughter's ab[s]ence (I will not [s]ay elopement) becau[s]e I am [s]ure, if the truth was known, it would not de[s]erve [s]o har[s]h an appellation. She [s]ent immediately to Mrs. Pringle's, where [s]he heard that the young gentleman went away, as he [s]aid, to join his regiment the afternoon before. Thus does this unlucky circum[s]tance tend to make it univer[s]ally believed, that Mi[s]s Howard and Mr. Pringle are together; but, indeed Mi[s]s, I do not think that is the ca[s]e; for, certain I am, that a purer heart never inhabited a human bo[s]om, and that [s]he never would have thought of eloping with a married man: besides, I am convinced [s]he was not greatly attached to him. He was the fir[s]t man who had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] ever addre[s][s]ed her; [s]he is the pure child of undisguised nature, and being plea[s]ed with his attentions which had the charm of novelty to recommend them; [s]he fancied her[s]elf in love; but after her conduct had been placed in a proper light, by her mother, [s]he [s]eemed perfectly convinced of her error, and often u[s]ed to [s]ay, [s]he wondered how [s]he could imagine [s]he loved a man, of whom [s]he knew [s]o little. "I [s]hould think, nur[s]e," [s]aid [s]he one day, "that this unfortunate affair in the end would be greatly beneficial to me, as it will make me, in future, di[s]tru[s]t the emotions of my heart, and be upon my guard again[s]t its deceptions; but I fear it has irreparably injured me in the opinion of my mother; but I mu[s]t endeavour, by my future conduct, to regain her confidence, and in the mean time, [s]ubmit with patience to that di[s]plea[s]ure I am certain I have in a great mea[s]ure de[s]erved." Such [s]entiments as the[s]e, madam, do not argue a depravity of heart. Oh! no, my [s]weet Meriel is at this moment as free from guilt as an angel. Three days are now elap[s]ed [s]ince her departure, during which time no tidings can be gained concerning her. Oh! Mi[s]s, I fear we [s]hall never [s]ee the dear creature again: [s]ome dreadful my[s]tery is certainly concealed by her thus abruptly leaving her father's hou[s]e. Would to heaven I had the means of clearing it up, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] at the [s]ame time removing the cloud which at pre[s]ent ob[s]cures the reputation of the mo[s]t innocent young lady that ever exi[s]ted. I will not fini[s]h this letter till to-morrow. If we hear no tidings then, I [s]hall give her up as lo[s]t forever. July 25 th . I ju[s]t [s]natch up my pen to inform you, dear Mi[s]s, that Mi[s]s Howard is found, and is at pre[s]ent in her father's hou[s]e; but in [s]uch a [s]ituation that we have little hope of her ever recovering her [s]en[s]es [s]ufficient to give any regular account of the cau[s]e of her flight, of this we are certain, [s]he was not with Mr. Pringle. July 28 th . I am now [s]itting by my poor young lady's bed [s]ide, who is ju[s]t fallen into a [s]weet refreshing [s]leep, and [s]hall [s]eize this opportunity to inform you, in what manner [s]he was di[s]covered and conducted home. A farmer who lives about five miles from hence, at the [s]kirt of a wood, having occa[s]ion for his hor[s]e to be brought from pa[s]ture early in the morning, ordered a lad who lived as a servant with him, to go by four o'clock and fetch it: the lad's way lay thro' the wood, and when he returned he declared he had been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] frightened almo[s]t to death by an apparition of a woman, dre[s][s]ed all in white, whom he [s]aw [s]itting at the foot of a tree as he went; that he heard her [s]igh and groan, and [s]aid he [s]uppo[s]ed it was the [s]pirit of Fanny Summers, who hung her[s]elf there la[s]t autumn, and he was the more po[s]itive of this, as at his return, he [s]aw her walking too and fro with a child in her arms and heard her talk to it. The farmer laughed at the lad's tale, and rode away without paying any farther attention to it, but a young gentleman who has a lodgings at the farmers, on account of an ill [s]tate of health, having over heard the boy's [s]tory, determined to ri[s]e immediately and go to the wood to inve[s]tigate the matter farther, as he [s]uppo[s]ed it might be [s]ome unfortunate human creature, rather than a [s]upernatural being; and determined, if in his power, to re[s]cue her from mi[s]ery, and, what appeared more than probable, a horrid and untimely end. He had not penetrated far into the wood before he di[s]covered, at the foot of an old oak, a female form [s]tretched on the ground, and by her [s]ide a little [s]paniel, who[s]e head lay on the woman's arm, and who at frequent intervals [s]eemed to make mo[s]t pitious moans. He approached and found the unfortunate female was in a fit, he gently rai[s]ed her from the ground, [s]upporting her in his arms whil[s]t he whil[s]t her temples with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] volatiles, which, on account of his own weak con[s]titution, he always carried in his pocket. While he was thus employed, the dog fawned upon him licked his hand and [s]hewed every token of gratitude in his power; at length the lady began to move, and her preserver hearing the voices of labourers pa[s][s]ing through the wood, hallowed to them for assistance. When they came near, the dog flew from his mi[s]tre[s]s to one of them, leaping, bounding and howling for joy. What Lubin, [s]aid the clown, how come you here, then drawing nearer to help [s]upport the lady; he [s]tarted back and cried, body o'me, 'tis Mi[s]s Meriel, poor dear [s]oul, how could [s]he get here, as [s]ure as any thing [s]he has been robbed and murdered. Almo[s]t [s]miling at the fellow's [s]tupidity, the young gentleman bid him cea[s]e his wonder and assist in bearing her to the farm which was the neare[s]t hou[s]e. The dear creaure never [s]poke during the whole time, indeed [s]he [s]eemed totally incapable of uttering a word, when they got her to the hou[s]e [s]he drank a few [s]poonfulls of milk, which [s]omewhat revived her, but her voice was [s]till [s]o weak they were unable to di[s]tingui[s]h what [s]he [s]aid, and her eyes too plainly indicated that her mind was di[s]turbed, the good woman of the hou[s]e had her put immediately to bed, and I[s]aac the labourer came home to let his ma[s]ter and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] mi[s]tre[s]s know were their daughter was. When he told the melancholy tale, Mrs. Howard cla[s]ped her hands and cried, my child deprived of her [s]en[s]es! [s]he had not time for more, for Mr. Howard had fallen on the floor in a fit. I cannot account for this violent emotion in a man, who had never [s]hewn any great degree of tenderne[s]s towards his child, but I think I never [s]aw the fonde[s]t parent more affected. When the family became tolerably composed, it was propo[s]ed that I [s]hould take a chai[s]e and proceed to the farm, when if Mi[s]s Howard was able to bear the motion of the carriage, I was to conduct her home; if not, to remain with her; and her mother would come to her in the morning. When I arrived at the farm, and was [s]hewn into the room where my dear young lady was; my agitation was [s]o great I thought I [s]hould have died; [s]he had on being fir[s]t put to bed fallen into a little doze, but [s]oon [s]tarted and awoke in great terror, and finding her[s]elf undre[s][s]ed, [s]creamed out, "oh heavens! I am betrayed, I am lo[s]t, he is here; I know he is here, and I will not [s]tay another moment." She then in[s]i[s]ted on being dre[s][s]ed. The neighbouring apothecary had been previously [s]ent for; he felt her pul[s]e and declared that the di[s]order lay entirely on her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] [s]pirits; that every nerve [s]eemed convul[s]ed, and [s]he al[s]o appeared to be greatly weakened for want of proper [s]u[s]tenance. She was prevailed on to eat a bit of bread, and drink a little weak wine and water; after which [s]he became a little more compo[s]ed, and had [s]unk into a profound [s]leep on the [s]ide of the bed. In this [s]ituation I found her; the faithful Lubin laying on a chair that [s]tood by the bed [s]ide, his head [s]tretched out to the pillow of his mi[s]tre[s]s, whom he had not quitted for a moment [s]ince her entrance into the hou[s]e. This dog had been mi[s][s]ing ever [s]ince Mi[s]s Howard's ab[s]ence, but our minds had been occupied by thoughts of [s]o much more di[s]tre[s][s]ing a nature that Lubin was hardly remembered; he was greatly attached to her from her fir[s]t return, and [s]he remarkably fond of him. I [s]at down silently on the [s]ide of the bed, and looked at her dear countenance which [s]o lately wore the bloom of youth and the [s]mile of innocent chearfulne[s]s: alas! how changed, deadly pale where her cheeks and lips, and only that I percieved [s]he breathed, I [s]hould have thought [s]he was no longer an inhabitant of this world; my tears flowed plentifully. Her [s]leep, tho' apparantly found, was not of long continuance; [s]he [s]hrieked, awoke, and immediately [s]tarted off the bed; I caught her hand, [s]he turned ha[s]tily round. "Oh! it is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] you Deborah, is it, well now we will go. If you will accompany me, [s]ay [s]o at once, if not I mu[s]t go without you; for I cannot [s]tay here another moment. But where is he now," looking wildly round her, "Who are you talking of my dear," [s]aid I, tenderly. "Ah! there is the thing now, I thought you would want to know his name, but I cannot tell you nur[s]e, [s]o do not a[s]k me; I have made a vow, a [s]olemn [s]acred vow, never to wound the peace of my dear, adored, mother." "But my dear creature you have almo[s]t broken her heart by thus flying from her protection and your father." "Father," [s]aid [s]he, "have I a father? Oh! that I had never been born." She then began to rave in a mo[s]t incoherent manner, and declared [s]he would not [s]tay another moment in the hou[s]e. I took this opportunity with the permi[s][s]ion of the apothecary to convey her home: when the chai[s]e [s]topped at the door [s]he looked out, and clapping her hand to her forehead, cried "yes I [s]ee how it is, well, well, it will not be long before I am relea[s]ed, and till then, I mu[s]t be patient." I a[s][s]i[s]ted her in alighting, [s]he leaned on my arm and walked [s]lowly into the hou[s]e; Mrs. Howard was [s]o overcome [s]he was unable to ri[s]e from her [s]eat. Meriel looked for a moment at her attentively, then [s]haking her head in a mo[s]t [s]orrowful manner, [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] cried, "oh! I [s]ee I have afflicted you, but, alas! my own heart is overwhelmed with [s]orrow; and then when I think for a moment, there are [s]ome remembrances which mu[s]t be ever buried in my heart, that torture me [s]o, my brain [s]eems on fire." Mrs. Howard attempted to [s]peak, but unequal to the ta[s]k, [s]he cla[s]ped her hands in an agony, and [s]obbed aloud: Meriel [s]unk on her knees before her, took both her hands, put them fir[s]t to her head and then to her heart; and breathing a deep [s]igh, fell lifele[s]s on the floor. We had her immediately conveyed to bed, where [s]he [s]oon recovered; but a violent fever come on, and [s]he continued raving all night. Mr. Howard has not yet [s]een her, he [s]ays if the girl's [s]pirits are in [s]uch perturbation, the [s]ight of him, whom [s]he mu[s]t be con[s]cious [s]he has offended, would only irritate them more, when [s]he is better I will [s]ee her, [s]aid he, and forgive her, that will calm and comfort her. A phy[s]ician was [s]ent for; he [s]aid quiet and tenderne[s]s from tho[s]e about her are the chief things requi[s]ite to re[s]tore her. In the mean time, my dear madam, [s]aid he, I will [s]end her a compo[s]ing draught; if when [s]he recovers the u[s]e of her rea[s]on, you can prevail with her to unburthen her mind, which, I am certain labours with [s]ome painful [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] secret, it would greatly a[s][s]i[s]t and ha[s]ten her recovery. Thus far, my dear Mi[s]s, have I given you an account of this my[s]terious affair. What to think of her [s]udden departure, and being found in [s]uch a [s]hocking [s]ituation, we are all totally at a lo[s]s. It appears [s]he has been terrified and extremely ill u[s]ed by [s]omebody; but even in the mo[s]t violent paroxi[s]ms of her delirium, [s]he has never mentioned his name. I have one thought that haunts me continually; but that is [s]o horrible I dare not commit it to paper. Indeed, it is too dreadful, too [s]hocking to human nature, to wear even the face of probability. The medicines pre[s]cribed have taken the de[s]ired effect, and [s]he has been in a compo[s]ed [s]leep above three hours. I will not conclude till I can inform you how [s]he appears on awaking, as I know your affection for her will make you extremely anxious. She awoke tolerably calm, in[s]tantly recollected where [s]he was, but did not [s]eem to retain any idea of the late unhappy events. "It is late, nur[s]e," [s]aid [s]he, addre[s][s]ing herself to me "is it not time to get up," then pau[s]ing a moment, "I have had [s]uch a horrid dream. Oh! I would not pa[s]s [s]uch [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] another night:" [s]he then attempted to ri[s]e; but finding her[s]elf extremely weak, [s]he continued, "what is the matter; have I been ill?" "Yes, my love," [s]aid I, "you have been very ill, and are far from well now." "Then perhaps it was not a dream," [s]aid [s]he, putting her hand to her forehead, as if trying to recollect; [s]he was [s]ilent for a few moments, then caught hold my hand, and bur[s]ting into tears, [s]he cried, "alas! it was all a reality." I did not attempt to [s]top her tears, as I thought they would relieve her. She a[s]ked for her mother; [s]eemed plea[s]ed to [s]ee her, but was too weak to talk much. The phy[s]ician has ju[s]t [s]een her, and declares her in a fair way to do well. I hope, Mi[s]s, you will excu[s]e all errors in this long letter, as I thought you would be anxious to know all the particulars, I have dwelt on the subject more than perhaps was nece[s][s]ary, but will now no longer intrude. I am, dear Mi[s]s, Your very humble [s]ervant, DEBORAH ELLIS. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Woodbine Cot Sept. 10 th , 1775. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] Once more, my beloved Celia, I am permitted to addre[s]s you; but I will not addre[s]s you in the voice of complaint, becau[s]e I might have been far more wretched than I am. Much gratitude is therefore due to that benignant power, who has protected me through many dangers, and [s]aved me from an evil which I could hardly have endured and lived. My [s]en[s]es too are restored, my life pre[s]erved by almo[s]t a miracle; and [s]hall I, [s]urrounded by the[s]e marvelous ble[s][s]ings, dare to repine becau[s]e I do not enjoy that tranquility of heart which young women of my age and fortune in general possess. I do not repine; I [s]ubmit to the chastening hand of heaven, I hope with that patience, which is the Chri[s]tian's duty. I do not even pre[s]ume to enquire, why the[s]e things are permitted; but yet my heart bleeds with my recent afflictions, and would fain [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] [s]eek ea[s]e by pouring forth its [s]orrows to that dear friendly girl, who will pity and [s]ooth them. You mu[s]t, long ere this, have received Deborah's letter, which has no doubt filled you with amazement. It is my [s]ad ta[s]k to explain to you the my[s]tery that invelopes my conduct. To no other per[s]on breathing will I unfold my labouring heart: no, not even to kind hearted Deborah, or my my dear [s]uffering mother: but to you, Celia, to you who[s]e thoughts are detached from the world, to you who will con[s]ider this confidence as [s]acred: to you I will venture to di[s]clo[s]e a [s]cene, the remembrance of which, even at this moment, chills the vital tide that nouri[s]hes my heart. But you, my gentle friend, well I know, tho' [s]truck with horror at the tale I [s]hall unfold, will join with me in offering to the throne of grace, fervent prayers for the author of my [s]orrows. "Oh thou Father, creator of the univer[s]e, look down upon him, pardon his manifold offences, touch his heart that he may [s]ee his errors, and oh! of thy infinite mercy, blot this la[s]t tran[s]gre[s][s]ion from the book of life." This is my daily prayer---but to proceed in my [s]ad ta[s]k: The day my mother went into Effex I felt my [s]pirits unu[s]ually oppre[s][s]ed, I rode out in the afternoon with my father, he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] was extremely gay in his conver[s]ation, indeed, I thought too much [s]o, as he treated [s]ome [s]ubjects with a levity which greatly [s]hocked me, and [s]ome expre[s][s]ions e[s]caped him which wounded my delicacy, but this did not [s]o much [s]urpri[s]e me as he had frequently indulged him[s]elf in very improper conver[s]ation, not only before me, but other young women, who vi[s]ited at the hou[s]e, for which my mother always reproved him, but he in general turned it off with a laugh. However, as I had no per[s]on with me in the chai[s]e, his manner was extremely embarassing, nay even di[s]tre[s][s]ing, for he [s]aluted me [s]everal times, told me he was afraid of shewing much affection to me before my mother, who in her heart hates me; but, that if I was a good girl, he would not care for my mother, but [s]hew me every kindne[s]s in his power; that I [s]hould go where I plea[s]ed, and do whatever my inclinations led me to. Astonished at this conver[s]ation, I hardly knew what to an[s]wer, and was extremely glad when we got home. I would have retired immediately to my appartment, but he insisted on my [s]taying to [s]up with him, [s]aying he had ordered a chicken on purpo[s]e for me. I reluctantly complied. During [s]upper he drank very freely and would have had me drink [s]everal gla[s][s]es of wine; which as I was unaccu[s]tomed to I re[s]olutely refu[s]ed. When [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] I had [s]upped he would have me play him a tune, after which he [s]ung a [s]ong more adapted to the ta[s]te of a libertine than the cha[s]te ears of a daughter. At ten o'clock I retired, and, tho' greatly [s]urprized at my father's conduct, yet having nothing particularly heavy on my mind, I [s]oon fell a[s]leep, I never had been u[s]ed to lock my door, and you may imagine my terror when being awoke by a noi[s]e in the room, I felt a man's hand take hold of mine; I gave a faint [s]cream, fright deprived me of much power, but how were my fears increa[s]ed, when I heard my father [s]ay, "hu[s]h! don't make a noi[s]e, it is only me." "You, [s]ir," I replied, [s]tarting up, "and what can be the cau[s]e of your coming here." I cannot remember his an[s]wer, Celia, but I know he caught me in his arms. I [s]prang from him with a violent effort, and quitting the bed, the darkne[s]s of the night befriended me and I ru[s]hed out of the room into Deborah's chamber. After this I kept my apartment for [s]everal days, nor did I intend to have left it again till my mother's return, pretending indi[s]po[s]ition; but he wrote me a letter, in which he a[s][s]erted that he had mi[s]taken my chamber for the housemaid's, with whom he confe[s][s]ed he had an intrigue. Oh Celia! what a humaliating confession from a father to a child, [s]ure none but an unprincipled rake could have brought [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] him[s]elf to make it. He begged I would not mention the circum[s]tance to my mother, and promi[s]ed amendment in future. Alas! I was deceived by this letter and again ventured down to my meals. The day Deborah had leave to go out I [s]pent the chief part below, he was remarkably re[s]erved in his behaviour, and [s]eemed even indifferent and inattentive to me, [s]carcely [s]peaking the whole day. At [s]upper I drank as u[s]ual one gla[s]s of wine and then retired; I felt an unaccountable drow[s]ine[s]s come over me; but it had been a [s]torm all the evening, and the almo[s]t ince[s][s]ant fla[s]hes of lightning, with di[s]tant rumbling thunder, prevented my indulging it. I had partly undre[s][s]ed my[s]elf and was [s]itting on the [s]ide of the bed endeavouring to compo[s]e my[s]elf, (for I am greatly terrified at lightning,) when the door opened, and my father entered; he immediately [s]hut the door and turned the key. To de[s]cribe my horror is impo[s][s]ible, or to give you the mo[s]t di[s]tant idea of the [s]cene that en[s]ued; but never to the late[s]t hour I have to breathe, will it be era[s]ed from my memory. My repeated [s]creams were of no avail. Deborah was from home, and the other maids [s]lept too far off to hear me. Oh! how often did I wi[s]h that the vivid lightning, which every moment illumined the room, would [s]trike me dead. At length a mo[s]t tremendous clap [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] of thunder bur[s]t as it were directly over us. It ennerved, even the arm of hardened guilt, but it encouraged me. I [s]eized the opportunity to fling open the window and declare, if he did not in[s]tantly quit my chamber, I would throw my[s]elf out, and [s]eeing a penknife lay on the window [s]eat, I [s]natched it up: "come not near me, [s]ir," [s]aid I, "for the moment you lay your hand upon me, this [s]hall put an end to your exi[s]tence." my fury which had wrought me almo[s]t to a [s]tate of frenzy, intimidated him. "Be patient, Meriel," [s]aid he, "[s]hut the window and get into bed, you will catch your death with cold." "Better be dead," [s]aid I, "than live with di[s]honour." "I [s]wear," he replied, "by all that is [s]acred, if you will go quietly to bed I will quit the room immediately." "You [s]hall quit it in[s]tantly," [s]aid I, in a menacing accent; "am I not your child, and do you dare invade the virtue it is your duty to protect?" Celia, I felt at that moment as tho' I could have encountered almo[s]t any thing; that I could have bared my bo[s]om to the [s]troke of death, and even met the blow with thankfulne[s]s; he [s]aw my increa[s]ing frenzy, and trembling unlocked the door and left the room. The moment he was gone I locked my[s]elf in, and overcome with horror and di[s]tre[s]s, fell almo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] lifeless on the bed: how long I continued in this [s]tate of torpor I cannot tell; but the fir[s]t u[s]e I made of my returning [s]en[s]es was to think of e[s]caping from the hou[s]e, and in this I was re[s]olutely determined, when I heard him again at the door demanding admission: the candle was now gone out, and the window [s]till open; the thought was momentary: I formed no plan for [s]upport, nor even thought of a place where to [s]eek an a[s]ylum; but, [s]tarting up, I pulled the [s]heets off the bed, and, undre[s][s]ed as I was, [s]lipped by them into the garden. How I escaped, unhurt, heaven alone can tell: the moment I felt my[s]elf on the ground I thanked God for my deliverance, and going out of the back garden gate, ran as fa[s]t as my [s]trength would permit, as I imagined, toward a neighbouring village; but as the day began to dawn, I found I had taken a wrong road, and was at the entrance of a large wood; I was afraid to return, le[s]t I [s]hould meet my father; therefore, forcing my way into the thicke[s]t part, I found a little hovel, which had been made by [s]ome unfortunate wanderer, of branches and dry leaves: into this poor [s]helter I crept, and here fir[s]t di[s]covered that my faithful Lubin was with me. The little affectionate animal crept clo[s]e up to me, licking my hands and face, as tho' he wi[s]hed to comfort me; in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] this [s]ituation, my cloaths wet, my [s]pirits harra[s][s]ed, and nature overcome, I [s]unk into a [s]lumber. But here I mu[s]t drop my pen, for memory no longer bears any traces of the en[s]uing [s]cenes, till I awoke in my own bed and [s]aw Deborah weeping by my [s]ide. Farewell, I will write again [s]oon. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Woodbine Cot Sept. 20th , 1775. My lot is hard, Celia, very hard; but I endeavour to keep up my [s]pirits, as well as I am able, and conduct my[s]elf in [s]uch a manner as my own heart may acquit me. When I was quite recovered from my illness, my mother called me one day into her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] dre[s][s]ing-room and a[s][s]ured me, [s]he would pardon my elopement, on condition I would inform her of the cau[s]e, and by what means I came in the [s]hocking [s]ituation already described. You may be certain I felt my[s]elf greatly agitated, as I knew I could not give this dear parent the [s]atisfaction [s]he required, without planting a dagger in her heart. Indeed, my friend, I cannot but feel thankful, that in my frenzy I did not di[s]cover the whole horrid [s]ecret, as it would have only involved us all in much greater di[s]tre[s]s than we experience at pre[s]ent. I remained [s]ilent to my mother's que[s]tion, but could not re[s]train my tears. She repeated it; conjuring me, in the mo[s]t [s]olemn manner, not to trifle with her, but to tell her what urged me to de[s]ert my home and friends. "Oh! my dear mother," [s]aid I, "do not a[s]k, indeed I cannot tell you. Suffer me to be [s]ilent on this [s]ubject; and, in every future action of my life, I will implicitly obey you." "I fear, Meriel," [s]aid my mother, "you have [s]ome unworthy rea[s]ons for this concealment: tell me, then, who advi[s]ed you to this imprudent [s]tep, and who accompanied you in your flight?" "No one," [s]aid I, "the re[s]olution was ha[s]tily formed, and as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] hastily executed; but I had no advi[s]er, no companion, nor do I think I ever went farther than the wood, where I was di[s]covered." "Meriel! Meriel!" [s]aid my mother, "I cannot believe you. It appears altogether improbable, that a young woman, without any apparent cau[s]e, [s]hould form a ha[s]ty resolution of running away; that [s]he [s]hould chu[s]e a tempe[s]tuous night to make her e[s]cape, without a companion, and hide her[s]elf in a wood with a de[s]ign to [s]tarve her[s]elf to death. Tell me, child, and tell me sincerely, did you not once love Pringle?" "I thought I did, but it was a mi[s]take of the heart." "I fear, Meriel, that mi[s]take has led to your ruin: he certainly accompanied you in your flight, and my child is lo[s]t to honour and to virtue. Is not this the cau[s]e of your ob[s]tinate [s]ilence: do you not fear that the villain, whom in your heart you [s]till love, [s]hould be brought to an[s]wer for his inhuman de[s]ertion of you." "Oh! no my dear mother," [s]aid I, redoubling my tears, "indeed you wrong me, I never entertained a thought that I [s]hould blu[s]h to own, and if it was my la[s]t moment, I could, with [s]afety to my con[s]cience, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] declare that neither Mr. Pringle, nor any of his family knew of my going away." "Strange infatuation," [s]aid [s]he, angrily, "to a[s][s]ert [s]uch fal[s]ehoods. Oh Meriel! I had hoped better from you; but I am [s]orry to [s]ay, in this in[s]tance, I can place no confidence in your veracity." Here my father entered the room, and would you believe it po[s][s]ible, Celia, he repeated to me every question which my mother had a[s]ked before. Astonishment riveted my tongue. I could not an[s]wer. My [s]ilence was accounted obstinacy, and my dear mother left me with the[s]e cruel words: "Di[s][s]embling, ob[s]tinate girl, I can never love you as I once did, though I will [s]trive to forgive you." My father [s]carcely now ever [s]peaks to me, and [s]eems in his heart to hate me, as he takes every opportunity in his power of mortifying me; con[s]trues my mo[s]t innocent actions into faults, and is continually complaining to my mother of my indolence, and [s]ulkine[s]s, as he inhumanely terms that want of vivacity, for which he [s]o well knows how to account. This ill humour I could bear patiently, but my mother's unkindne[s]s is wor[s]e than a dagger to my heart. I live in greater [s]olitude than ever; I never go out, and when any company comes to the family, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] I in general retire to my own room; for my feelings are often hurt by the ignorant, I had almo[s]t [s]aid inhuman que[s]tions, that are a[s]ked me by people who have no other interest in my fate, than as it [s]erves to gratify their curio[s]ity. Next week I expect my brother home from [s]chool; he does not return again, but is to be articled apprentice to a merchant in London. I [s]hall not be [s]orry when he is gone, for I expect to [s]uffer greatly from his unfeeling taunts. Oh! Celia, heaven and you know how little I de[s]erve them; and that thought [s]hall be my comfort and [s]upport. Adieu my friend. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London December 19 th , 1775.

I ran down [s]tairs into the parlour, from whence the noi[s]e proceeded, and on entering [s]aw two ill looking men, one of which had [s]eized my father by the collar, and the other was a[s][s]i[s]ting to drag him away. "What is the matter," [s]aid I, to the men, "what are you doing with my father?" "Oh! we will do him no harm," [s]aid one of them; "he mu[s]t only come away with us to my hou[s]e, at Litchfield, till he has [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] paid five hundred pounds." "Five hundred pounds," [s]aid I, "why, dear madam," turning to my mother, "to whom does my father owe [s]o much money." "Oh child!" [s]aid he, "your mother knows nothing about the affair, I not only owe that, but three times the [s]um; we are inevitably ruined, and all by my own folly. I have been bound for a friend of mine, a young man, at Litchfield, who is gone off, and I [s]hall have all his debts to di[s]charge." My poor mother [s]at weeping; and, on hearing this account, lifted up her eyes in [s]peechle[s]s agony. I could not bear to [s]ee her di[s]tre[s]s. "It is a large [s]um to be [s]ure gentlemen," [s]aid I, "but it [s]hall be paid, [s]o let my father remain, and do you go away for to night; to-morrow we will [s]end you the money." Alas! Celia, how very little I knew of the world. The inhuman men laughed at me, and a[s]ked me, "when I ever heard of bailiffs letting go their pri[s]oner on the bare word of a girl." "If you will not take my word," [s]aid I, "leave my fahter and take me, for it will break my dear mother's heart to have him carried to pri[s]on; but, as to me, it matters not what becomes of me." "That won't do neither, Mi[s]s," [s]aid they, "we mu[s]t either have the money or take the gentleman away." Alas!" [s]aid I, turning to my mother, "what can I do? they will not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] release him." No my child," [s]aid my mother, with more affection in her voice than I had heard for [s]ome time, "we mu[s]t [s]ubmit as patiently as we can till to-morrow, and then [s]ee what can be done." My father went away cur[s]ing his evil genius. Why will people, Celia, when they bring misfortune on their own heads, rail at fate; yet you will find it always the ca[s]e, and the more egregrious have been their errors, the more vehement their compalints. When they were gone, I exerted my[s]elf to con[s]ole my mother, but her only an[s]wer was, "Ah Meriel! what will become of us, I [s]ee ruin approaching; I know of no way to avoide it, and my poor boy, what will he do." "Let me intreat you my dear mother," [s]aid I, "not to let this accident thus di[s]tre[s]s you: can you [s]uppo[s]e, that while I have the means of living in ea[s]e and comfort, I would [s]uffer my parent or my brother to feel any embarra[s][s]ment, which it is in my power to remove. Did I not [s]olemnly promi[s]e the dear departed [s]aint, who made me thus independant, never to for[s]ake you?" "But alas! Meriel, have you not already broke that vow?" "Dear, dear madam, forgive, forget, that involuntary tran[s]gre[s][s]ion; and believe me, there never was a heart that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] glowed with more filial love, or greatful tenderness, than mine does towards you. My fortune is your's, I will [s]hare it with you and my brother to the la[s]t [s]hilling; nay to convince you of my [s]incerity, I would freely renounce it all, and depend on my labour for [s]upport." My mother was affected, but it was only for a moment, [s]he again a[s][s]umed a look of coldne[s]s, and told me [s]he feared I often [s]uffered the warmth of my imagination to hurry me into expre[s][s]ions and promises, the nature of which I did not duly con[s]ider. She then bid me good night and left me. Grieved to be thought [s]o very unworthy, by the per[s]on on earth I mo[s]t loved, mo[s]t wi[s]hed to [s]ee happy, I could take no re[s]t all night. As [s]oon as day-light appeared I aro[s]e, and dre[s][s]ing my[s]elf as plain as po[s][s]ible, borrowing a black bonnet of Deborah, I determined to [s]et out for Litchfield on foot; but, fearing my mother might be alarmed at my ab[s]ence, I left a note informing her, in a few words, that I was gone to endeavour to prove my[s]elf worthy of her love. During my walk I revolved in my mind what [s]teps to pur[s]ue. Mr. Sutten was joint guardian with my father: I had no doubt he had been [s]ent for on account of the arre[s]t, and hoped to prevail on him to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] advance [s]ufficient money to make my poor mother ea[s]y in her mind. I therefore determined to go immediately to the hou[s]e of the bailiff, and learn at who[s]e [s]uit my father had been arre[s]ted. From thence I would go to the creditor and endeavour to prevail with him to take half the money now, and the re[s]t when I became my own mi[s]tre[s]s, which, according to Mrs. Mirvan's will, was to be at eighteen years old. Here bu[s]y reflection aro[s]e, and told me how very unworthy of my attention my father was, but he is my father [s]till, [s]aid I, and tho' he has forgotten his duty towards me, it does not follow that I am to neglect mine to him: be[s]ides, religion teaches us to reward evil with good; and [s]urely, if there is any way of awakening the per[s]on who injures us, to a [s]en[s]e of their guilt, it is by [s]hewing them an example of chri[s]tian charity, and good will; be[s]ides, my mother and brother have not injured me, and why [s]hould they [s]uffer for the vices of my father? Occupied by the[s]e reflections, I entered Litchfield, and went directly to the bailiff's hou[s]e. My father was not up; indeed I did not wi[s]h to [s]ee him if he had, [s]o I only made the nece[s][s]ary enquiries, learnt who the creditor was, and proceeded directly to the [s]treet where he lived. Mr. Lee[s]on is a man, who, for many years, [s]erved a nobleman in London, as I have been told, tho' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] in what capacity, I never heard. In his service, he accumulated a con[s]iderable fortune, and married a lady, a particular friend of his lord[s]hip's. Soon after he procured a pension, with which he came down to Litchfield, the place of his lady's birth, where he is now reckoned a very great man. This was the per[s]on who had occa[s]ioned my father's imprisonment. On knocking at the door a [s]ervant appeared yawning, and examining my dre[s]s with a [s]crutinizing eye, a[s]ked what I wanted. "I wi[s]h too [s]ee Mr. Lee[s]on," [s]aid I, "on particular bu[s]ine[s]s." "Humph," [s]aid the fellow, [s]tanding with his back again[s]t the wall, his hands in his breeches pockets, "you mu[s]t wait a good while before you can [s]ee him, for he is not up yet." "Pray friend," [s]aid I, "give me leave to go in and [s]it down till your ma[s]ter does get up." "You may go down [s]tairs," [s]aid he, "if you will, and when ma[s]ter is [s]tirring, I will let you know." Humiliating, as it was, I went down [s]tairs, [s]at down by the kitchen fire and dried my feet, which were wet, [s]ome rain having fallen in the night; my petticoat was al[s]o pla[s]hed with dirt. About nine o'clock, a [s]pruce young woman, in a long white bedgown, came into the kitchen, and looking at me with a [s]ort of contemptuous [s]neer, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] cries, "[s]ervant ma'am, pray who may you want?" Imagining, from her appearance, and the manner in which [s]he put the question, that [s]he might be [s]ome relation of the family, I ro[s]e from my [s]eat, and answered I had bu[s]ine[s]s of much importance with Mr. Lee[s]on. "Aye Mrs. Bridget," cried a footman, who was cleaning [s]ome silver candle[s]ticks, at the dre[s][s]er; "when my lady's bell rings, you mu[s]t let ma[s]ter know, this here young body has been waiting here ever [s]ince eight o'clock." A young la[s]s, in appearance a menial [s]ervant, now appeared, and [s]preading a fine napkin on the table, brought the breakfa[s]t things, toa[s]ted [s]ome oat cakes, and Mrs. Bridget and Mr. James [s]at very comfortably down to breakfa[s]t; but during their repa[s]t, neither a[s]ked me if I would partake, tho' they endeavoured to gratify their curio[s]ity, by a[s]king, how far I had walked, if I had been long in the country, and many other que[s]tions, equally impertinent and in[s]ignificant; to all which I answered in little more than mono[s]yllables. At length the bell rang, and Mrs. Bridget making a ha[s]ty fini[s]h of her breakfa[s]t, ran up [s]tairs: [s]oon after, the footman having equip'd him[s]elf as a valet, went out of the kitchen. I was now once more left to myself, but had not indulged reflection long, before the girl, who had prepared the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] breakfast, came and [s]at down, in order to eat her own. She pour'd out two cups of tea, got up and held the oat cake (which was almo[s]t cold) to the fire, then ca[s]ting a look, fir[s]t at me, then at the table, in a mild accent, as tho' fearful of giving offence, [s]aid, "I am afraid you have not breakfa[s]ted ma'am; pray eat a bit, and take this cup of tea," hoiding the plate and tea towards me. "Mrs. Bridget is very proud ma'am, and Mr. James does nothing but what he thinks [s]he will like; but I thinks your London folks are all proud; they [s]erves only to make places uncomfortable. Do ma'am take it; I wi[s]h it was hotter and better." "It is very good," [s]aid I, taking a bit; for the poor girl's goodne[s]s of heart was [s]o conspicuous that I could not mortify her by a refusal. She [s]miled, began drinking her own tea, and continued: "Mr. James was quite a different [s]ort of a body, I a[s][s]ures you ma'am before he went to London la[s]t [s]ummer with my mi[s]tre[s]s; dear heart, he and I were [s]o comfortable and happy, but when they came home my lady brought Mrs. Bridget with her, and ever [s]ince"---She pau[s]ed; I [s]aw her eyes gli[s]ten. Poor girl, thought I, James is fal[s]e hearted, he has for[s]aken thee for Bridget; and yet, if he had but discernment to perceive the difference between the two hearts, how gladly would he return to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] one [s]o gentle and tender. Here I was interrupted by Mr. James him[s]elf, who told me his ma[s]ter de[s]ired me to walk up. I bade the kind hearted girl good morning, and followed James into the pre[s]ence of his ma[s]ter. "Well, young woman," [s]aid Mr. Leeson, who was [s]tanding with his back to the [s]ire, and his hands behind him. (Celia I mu[s]t here digre[s]s to give you [s]ome [s]mall idea of his per[s]on and manner.) A per[s]on rather above the middle [s]ize, a face, the features of which, might have been termed regular, and even plea[s]ing, had benevolence, good humour or politene[s]s been any way di[s]cernable in it, in[s]tead of which there was an in[s]olent pertne[s]s, a [s]upercilious, self-approving [s]mile, that to my idea portrayed nothing but ignorance, pride and conceit. "Well, young woman," [s]aid he, "what may be your commands with me." "You are [s]ir, I under[s]tand, the per[s]on who has cau[s]ed Mr. Howard to be arre[s]ted." He an[s]wered in the a[s][s]irmative. "I waited on you, [s]ir, to make [s]ome proposal concerning this affair, in hopes of being the means of his obtaining his liberty." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] "What, do you belong to Mrs. Belmour?" "Belong to who [s]ir?" in an accent of [s]urprize. "To Mrs. Belmour; the woman for whom Howard has thus involved himself." "I under[s]tood, [s]ir, that he was bound for a friend." "Well child, [s]he was his friend, my friend, any body's friend: why [s]ure you know her." "Indeed, [s]ir, I never heard of her before: I am Mr. Howards daughter." "Ble[s]s my [s]oul! Mr. Howard's daughter, are you; well I have often heard of you, tho' I never had the plea[s]ure of [s]eeing you before. I remember hearing of that [s]trange affair of your running away after Ensign Pringle, and when he refu[s]ed to have any thing to [s]ay to you, being afraid to go home again, you hid your[s]elf in a wood, and went out of your [s]en[s]es." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] Celia, can you for a moment [s]uppo[s]e what, at that in[s]tant, were my feelings; unable any longer to [s]upport my[s]elf I [s]unk into the neare[s]t chair, (for I had been kept [s]tanding) and bur[s]t into tears. "'Pon honour, Mi[s]s," [s]aid he, "I beg pardon, I did not mean to make you unea[s]y; but when one hears [s]uch [s]trange [s]tories, one likes, you know, to come at the truth: 'pon my [s]oul I wi[s]h I had been in Pringles place, I [s]hould not have driven [s]uch a pretty little kind [s]oul to di[s]pair." During this [s]peech he had drawn nearer to me and had taken one of my hands, which I drew from him with di[s]dain. "Sir," [s]aid I, with as much compo[s]ure as I could a[s][s]ume, "you have been totally mi[s]informed about that unhappy affair; and, pardon me, if I [s]ay, that it can be no bu[s]ine[s]s of your's, to enquire, what were the motives of a conduct, which, I find, has ca[s]t a fatal [s]hade upon my reputation; I do not think my[s]elf accountable for my actions, to you or any other indifferent per[s]on: it is [s]ufficient that heaven and my own heart acquits me of evil. I came here, Mr. Lee[s]on, to con[s]ult about the liberation of my father; let me know on what terms that can be obtained, and I am ready to comply with them.

"Well, [s]ir, and to how much does that amount." "To five hundred and twenty pounds." "Well, [s]ir, if I pay you three hundred now, and bind my[s]elf by the mo[s]t [s]olemn engagement to pay the other when I am eighteen, will you [s]et Mr. Howard at liberty." "There is the intere[s]t of the money, Mi[s]s, and then the hazard, this money being all advanced out of my own pocket, Mi[s]s, and you are only a minor you know." "I [s]ind, [s]ir," [s]aid I, ri[s]ing from my [s]eat, "that I am totally un[s]it to talk on the[s]e matters, being but little acquainted with the world, or what is daily acting in it; I will therefore take my leave, for the pre[s]ent, and return in about two hours with Mr. Sutten, my guardian, who will better understand how to [s]ettle the affair." I now returned to the bailiff's hou[s]e, where I learnt Mr. Sutten was with my father. I de[s]ired that he might be informed I was there, and wi[s]hed to [s]peak with him; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] I mu[s]t give you the re[s]ult of our conver[s]ation in my next, as I have many things to attend to be[s]ides writing to my Celia. Ah! my dear girl, times are [s]trangely altered, but, I thank heaven, I have health and more [s]pirits than could be well expected after the painful [s]cenes I have gone through; but no doubt I may have many more trials yet to endure. Pray for me, my friend, that I may have [s]trength of mind to bear them as I ought, [s]o as not to di[s]grace the religion of which I am a profe[s][s]or; and be a[s][s]ured, that every kind wi[s]h of my heart is daily offered up for your felicity; and that the remembrance of the happy, happy hours we have [s]pent together, is ever pre[s]ent to the mind of your MERIEL.

When Mr. Sutten appeared, he was greatly [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee me at Litchfield, and when I told him of my vi[s]it to Mr. Lee[s]on, he appeared very angry and [s]aid, "with his good will, I [s]hould not pay a farthing, and at any rate I [s]hould not have the money, till I was of age; for I might, if I attempted to extricate my father from his pre[s]ent difficulites, [s]oon be reduced to beggary, and leave myself without the power of a[s][s]i[s]ting my mother; who was far more de[s]erving my affection and duty." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] "It is on her account, [s]ir," [s]aid I, "that I am thus anxious. Her happine[s]s is bound up with my father's, and while he is under confinement [s]he will be mi[s]erable; be[s]ides, Mr. Sutten, [s]he does not think I love her, does not think me capable of doing a worthy action. Oh! [s]ir, give me the power to convince her, that my own intere[s]t and happiness is of little value when put in competition with her's." "My dear mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, "you mu[s]t confe[s]s appearances have been strangely again[s]t you. I will acknowledge I my[s]elf have had my doubts concerning the rectitude of your heart." "Oh! I know," [s]aid I, "there is a fatal my[s]tery involves my conduct, a my[s]tery which I never can reveal." "Nor will I de[s]ire it," replied the humane Mr. Sutten, "I [s]ee at this moment [s]uch traits of genuine goodne[s]s, [s]uch proofs of a mind, impre[s][s]ed with a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of its duty, that I [s]hall always think you had [s]ome very ju[s]t cau[s]e for your pa[s]t conduct, nor will I believe it po[s][s]ible for a heart capable of conceiving [s]uch noble, di[s]intere[s]ted re[s]olutions, to harbour inclinations derogatory to the honour and dignity of a virtuous woman."

Beauty and merit, my dear girl, are oftener a prejudice than a benefit to the po[s]e[s][s]ors; it is an object of envy to your own [s]ex; and, [s]orry I am to add, in general excites no other ideas in the bo[s]om of ours, than to lead them to endeavour to vitiate tho[s]e principles they pretend to adore; let me intreat you, therefore, to [s]et a ju[s]t value on that independence, with which it has plea[s]ed heaven to ble[s]s you; a[s][s]i[s]t your parents as far as you can, without hurting your[s]elf, and remember, that to [s]ecure the friend[s]hip of others you mu[s]t not need their a[s][s]i[s]tance." This, my dear Celia, was arguing like a cold philo[s]opher, and a man of the world; but it was not [s]peaking with the [s]pirit of chri[s]tianity, or with the enthu[s]ia[s]m of a heart that glows with benevolence to all its fellow creatures. The dear le[s][s]ons which I imbibed at Bologne taught me to regard myself but in a [s]econdary light, when any thing prai[s]e-worthy was to be performed, and to remember only the precepts of him who taught us to do as we would be done by; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] and, like the good Samaritan, to pour oil and wine into the wounds of our [s]uffering fellow creatures; but to proceed: Mr. Sutten refu[s]ed to advance a [s]hilling, and I was forced to return to my mother, di[s]appointed, dejected, and weary. Two days after, an execution was [s]ent to Woodbine Cot; my poor mother and myself were obliged to remove to Litchfield, where we took a [s]mall lodging near the hou[s]e where my father was, where we remained till the e[s]tate was [s]old and all paid away to the la[s]t farthing, nor was even that enough to an[s]wer all the demands that were continually pouring in from all quarters; be[s]ides, when the e[s]tate came to be [s]old, it was found [s]o encumbered with mortgages, &c. that it would not [s]ell for above half its value. When all was [s]ettled, and my father at liberty, it was determined that we [s]hould [s]et forward to London, where my father in[s]i[s]ted we could live much cheaper than in the country, where we were [s]o well known. There was [s]till the intere[s]t of my four thou[s]and pounds, which as it was at my own di[s]po[s]al, I determined to devote to the [s]upport of the family. All our [s]ervants were di[s]charged, poor Deborah too; you cannot think, Celia, what I [s]uffered on being [s]eparated from this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] faithful woman. She offered to [s]tay with us without being paid; but my mother would not con[s]ent to reeicve an obligation from an inferior. I thought the re[s]olution [s]avoured of pride; but we all have our failings, and perhaps pride in [s]ome degree, is laudable. On our arrival in town, we took a [s]mall lodging and hired a young woman to do the mo[s]t laborious part of our dome[s]tic bu[s]ine[s]s; the re[s]t it is my province to perform; and, believe me, I do it chearfully. It employs my mind, prevents my taking melancholy retro[s]pects, and I think contributes to improve both my health and [s]pirits. We have paid a vi[s]it to my father's elde[s]t [s]i[s]ter. She is married to a coun[s]ellor, who has made a genteel independence by his profe[s][s]ion. My aunt is a woman who[s]e character I do not well know how to develope. She is in general affable, conde[s]cending, and chearful; and in conver[s]ation, gives evident proofs of a genteel education, and a brilliant understanding; but, withall is [s]o tinctured with vanity, and tho' upwards of forty, [s]till possesses that [s]pirit of coquetry, that in a great measure ob[s]cures her good qualities. Her daughters, He[s]ter and Su[s]an, have had, what is termed a fa[s]hionable education, that is, they can daub a fan mount, jumble the keys of the harp[s]ichord, and jabber an unintelligible [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] jargon, which they call French. They are realy lovely girls. He[s]ter, in particular, [s]eems calculated to in[s]pire love and re[s]pect, wherever [s]he appears. Su[s]an is more volatile, but, withall can make her[s]elf extremely agreeable. They are both [s]poilt by the mother, who, having taken it into her head, that their beauty will certainly recommend them to men of rank and fortune, is continually filling the poor girls' minds with that kind of vanity, and eager de[s]ire of conquest, that in general fails of the de[s]ired effect, and repels the admiration, which it is de[s]igned to attract. Their naturally good di[s]po[s]itions are by the[s]e means totally preverted, and in[s]tead of being the engaging, innoecnt, unaffected girls, which nature form'd them, they appear, in a mixed company, a combination of pride, vanity, and [s]elf-conceit. Mr. Mo[s]op, their father, is haughty, distant, and forbidding in his manner, po[s]e[s][s]es a great deal, of what is called family pride: has little feeling and le[s]s good nature, yet on the whole is deemed a re[s]pectable character. He is [s]trictly hone[s]t in his principles, pays every one their due to the utmo[s]t farthing, but will not be[s]tow the lea[s]t trifle in charity, becau[s]e he con[s]iders con[s]tantly paying the poor rate to be a [s]ufficient [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] discharge of that duty. The query with me, is, whether he would pay that [s]um yearly if not obliged to it; if not, where is the merit of paying it now. Oh! Celia, how do I hate tho[s]e luke-warm hearts. You may remember I always [s]hewed a di[s]like to the cool doctrines of philo[s]ophy. I could never have a good opinion of a per[s]on who regards every [s]urrounding object with the [s]toical eye of apathy. I am [s]ure they mu[s]t po[s][s]e[s]s hearts, rendered impenetrable by nature to tho[s]e fine feelings, which, tho' at [s]ome moments they may di[s]tre[s]s, in general elevate and expand the [s]oul. For my own part, Celia, I am as weak as an infant, whenever a [s]cene of di[s]tre[s]s or happine[s]s meets my eye, I have a tear of [s]ympathy for the one, and a [s]mile of gratulation for the other; and the [s]mile and the tear, mingle [s]o [s]weetly with each other, that every faculty is harmonized by the union, and I am at a lo[s]s to tell which [s]en[s]ation is the mo[s]t exqui[s]itely delightful. Then let the unfeeling boa[s]t the philo[s]ophic calmne[s]s of their tempers. I will not scruple to aver, that tho' they may e[s]cape many an acute pang, that wrings the heart of sensibility, they know not what true plea[s]ure is. But I am [s]trangely digre[s][s]ing from my subject. You will wonder perhaps, how I [s]o [s]oon comprehended the character of my uncle's family: believe me, Celia, it was not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] by my own penetration that I di[s]covered them. From my own ob[s]ervations, I [s]hould have [s]uppo[s]ed Mr. Mo[s][s]op an agreeable man, his wife a charming, amiable woman, and the two young ladies the [s]weete[s]t, mo[s]t engaging girls in the world; nay, at this very moment, I feel [s]o inclined to love the whole family, that I think the di[s]agreeable traits in their characters have been exaggerated. It was to a Mr. Rainsforth, that I was indebted for this minute delineation of them. This Mr. Rainsforth is an agreeable young man, whom I have frequently [s]een at my uncle's, and at fir[s]t thought he was partial to my cou[s]in He[s]ter, but I find I was mi[s]taken in this [s]uppo[s]ition, as his intimacy in the family proceeds from his having been [s]chool-fellow with young Mo[s][s]op, whom I have as yet [s]een but little of. Rainsforth is the [s]on of a merchant, in Plymouth. His mother died when he was an infant, and his father has, within the[s]e few years, married a woman many years younger than him[s]elf, by whom he has a young family. Frederic has a [s]mall fortune independent of his father, and is be[s]ides a lieutenant in the navy. My father [s]eems very partial to him; that, you will [s]ay, is no great recommendation; but I flatter myself, Celia, this unhappy father begins to [s]ee [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] his errors, and will, in future atone for them. I think, tho' our income is circum[s]cribed, and our [s]ituation greatly altered, my dear mother is much happier than I ever [s]aw her. I cannot boa[s]t of much happine[s]s my[s]elf; remembrance, painful rembrance, damps every little plea[s]ure or amu[s]ement that is offered to my notice; yet, when I look round me, and behold many who are perhaps my superiors in worth and virtue, peri[s]hing for want of the common nece[s][s]aries of life; oppre[s][s]ed with [s]ickne[s]s; [s]urrounded with children, who look up to them for that [s]upport, which they have not to be[s]tow: when I [s]ee the[s]e things, my friend, I lift up my heart in humble gratitude to that Providence, who has, thro' life, given a portion into my hand, the overplus of which may, in [s]ome little degree, [s]erve to cheer the [s]ons and daughters of misery. You [s]mile to hear me talk of having any to [s]pare from my little income. Oh! my dear girl, had I but a [s]hilling in my pocket, I could not call it my own, if I [s]aw a fellow creature who[s]e heart would be in the lea[s]t lightened by [s]haring it with me. My aunt has promi[s]ed to take me to a play. I am fond reading dramatic works, and form great expectations of amu[s]ement from [s]eeing a performance. I will certainly give you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] [s]ome account of my entertainment whenever I go.

I never [s]hall get u[s]ed to the ways of London, and I am always bringing myself into difficulties, and fooli[s]h embarrasments, through my ignorance; then my mother is angry, and what in reality proceeds from [s]implicity of my nature, is construed into art or levity. I have been fretting the[s]e two hours about a circum[s]tance that has highly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] offended my dear mother; and, I am [s]ure, Celia, I did it without a thought of harm. I had been out a little way ye[s]terday, and was returning in the clo[s]e of the evening, when I heard a very genteel looking elderly gentleman enquiring the way to a [s]treet which lay in my way home; the per[s]on whom he addre[s][s]ed could not direct him, and I, uncon[s]cious of any impropriety, stepped forward and told him, as it lay in my way, I would [s]hew him the place he enquired for: he [s]eemed much obliged to me, and [s]aid, "as we were going the [s]ame way I might as well take hold of his arm;" but this, as he was quite a [s]tranger, I refu[s]ed to do; however, I could not help an[s]wering [s]ome civil que[s]tions, which he a[s]ked, and when we arrived at the [s]treet he had mentioned, he in[s]i[s]ted on [s]eeing me [s]afe home: this I remon[s]trated again[s]t, [s]aying, besides giving him unnece[s][s]ary trouble, it would make my mother very angry with me. At this he declared he knew my mother very well, and he was not at all afraid of her anger, as he was certain it lay in his power to appea[s]e it. I was [s]urpri[s]ed, you may imagine, and indeed very unea[s]y all the re[s]t of the way, as I knew how offended my mother would be, at [s]eeing a [s]tranger come home with me. When the [s]ervant opened the door he walked in without any [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] ceremony, and going into the parlour which was occupied by the gentlewoman who keeps the hou[s]e, he thus addre[s][s]ed her, "Servant, my good madam, your lovely daughter here, having kindly given me an invitation home, I flatter my[s]elf we [s]hall [s]pend a chearful evening, and you and I, my good mother, [s]hall not di[s]agree, I warrant." Mrs. Fermor [s]tared, and I felt ready to [s]ink into the earth. "You are under a mi[s]take, [s]ir," [s]aid I, "pray leave me." "What, leave you, my little dove, when you have been [s]o very kind, no, no! hardly [s]uch a fool as that; come mother, what [s]hall I order in for supper, and what wine will you drink?" "Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid Mrs. Fermor, "I am overwhelmed with a[s]toni[s]hment; how have you dared to bring this gentleman here to insult me?" "Indeed madam," I replied, terrified beyond mea[s]ure, "I am innocent of any intention to offend you; this gentleman"--- "Why, I can tell the tale as well as you my pretty one," [s]aid he, interrupting me: "you mu[s]t know, madam, I was coming into We[s]tmin[s]ter, and did not rightly know my way, [s]o, this pretty, kind hearted dam[s]el was [s]o good as to [s]hew me, that is all, ma'am, and [s]o in return, I am only grateful, and would willingly treat you with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] a good [s]upper, and as far as ten guineas would go." At this moment my father came in, and [s]eeing me [s]tand trembling in the parlour, a fre[s]h [s]cene of confu[s]ion in[s]ued, which ended in the whole family believing I had invited the old gentleman home with me, merely out of levity, and as Mrs. Fermor called it, an indi[s]creet frolic. You may [s]uppo[s]e how rigorous my mother was, how angry my father; for tho' in his heart, he has not the lea[s]t regard for real virtue, he always pretends great attention to my conduct, and this evening declared he would rather follow me to the grave than [s]ee me lo[s]t to honour. Oh! Celia, how my [s]oul dete[s]ts his hypocrisy. It gives me great unea[s]ine[s]s to find ju[s]t as my mother began to have a better opinion of me, I have again lo[s]t her considence; am again abridged of my walks, and at home [s]ee only the frown of di[s]plea[s]ure, [s]it on that face which once beamed on me the [s]mile of maternal tenderne[s]s. My brother is at length [s]ettled in an eminent merchants counting-hou[s]e; I have engaged my[s]elf to pay the nece[s][s]ary [s]um, when I am put in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my fortune; and, to tell you the truth, Celia, I am re[s]olved to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] [s]tay in my father's family no longer than that time; but, by [s]ome genteel employment, endeavour to earn [s]ub[s]i[s]tence for my[s]elf, as I am determined not to deprive my mother of [s]upport, by taking the money into my own hands. March 5 th . My aunt has ju[s]t called, and after a great deal of per[s]ua[s]ion, has prevailed with my mother to let me go to the play to-morrow evening; I am to go out this afternoon with my cou[s]ins, to purcha[s]e [s]ome few articles of dre[s]s nece[s][s]ary to my appearing at a public place, as my aunt always takes my cou[s]ins to the mo[s]t con[s]picuous part of the theatre. Well, it will be of little con[s]equence to me, where we [s]it; I go to [s]ee and not to be [s]een, I wi[s]h to be amu[s]ed my[s]elf, but have not the lea[s]t ambition to be the amu[s]ement of others, either from my per[s]on, dre[s]s or manner. Well, Celia, had I ever been vain of my per[s]on, I [s]hould now be perfectly cured of [s]o ridiculous a vanity; but it is happy for me, that I never thought my face more than pa[s][s]able; and as to my [s]hape, I knew it had not the [s]malle[s]t pretentions to either grace or elegance; and, by having this humble opinion, I have e[s]caped a [s]evere [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] mortification; for you know, my Celia, the [s]evere[s]t reflections loo[s]e their force, when we can li[s]ten to them with good humour, and return an an[s]wer with a [s]mile. I accompanied my aunt and cou[s]ins to a milliner's; Mr. Rainsforth and young Mossop were of the party. I am a[s]toni[s]hed how young men can [s]uffer them[s]elves to be dragged as it were to [s]uch places, and have the patience to li[s]ten to a tedious desertation on gauzes, ribbons, lace and a hundred other trifles, almo[s]t below the notice of a rational being. But, if I was [s]urpri[s]ed at that, how much more was I to [s]ee a parcel of powdered effeminate animals, for I will not call them men, [s]tuck up behind a counter, mea[s]uring a peny-worth of tape or a [s]maller quantity perhaps; telling you with the gravity of a philo[s]opher, that [s]uch a ribond become your delicate complexion; [s]uch a cap [s]et off your features to advantage, &c. And, will you believe it po[s][s]ible, that one morning being in a perfumer's [s]hop, I [s]aw an officer in the army, purcha[s]ing chicken gloves, violet powder and cold cream, aye, and for his own u[s]e too, for the ma[s]ter informed me he had neither wife nor [s]i[s]ter, to whom [s]uch things might have been of u[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] Well, to the milliner's we went, where He[s]ter and Su[s]an having cho[s]en their caps. I was plea[s]ed with the choice of the fomer, and [s]aid I would have one like it. "Lord, my dear," [s]aid my aunt, "how can you think of [s]uch a thing, pretty women you know may wear any thing, but tho[s]e that are plain [s]hould [s]tudy what will mo[s]t become them." "Aye," cried young Mossop, "my cou[s]in to be [s]ure [s]hould not wear any thing that atrtacts general notice." "Here," [s]aid Su[s]an, "here Meriel, is a very pretty cap, I think it will become you va[s]tly." It was etremely plain, having no ornament but a knott of white [s]attin ribbon. "You are quite right, cou[s]in," [s]aid I, "this cap will certainly [s]uit me be[s]t. I never love to be fine, and what will be becoming on you, will only appear an affectation of finery on me." I [s]aid this with a [s]mile, as I tried on the cap. Mr. Rainsforth told my aunt he thought true beauty required few ornaments. "Come, come, you rally," [s]aid [s]he, "you can't think Meriel hand[s]ome." He made no an[s]wer, but [s]miling, [s]ung the following [s]tanza, which, as it contained a delicate compliment, you will pardon me if I here repeat it.

But, my Celia will [s]ay my letters begin to be very in[s]ipid, when I can find no other theme than the repetition of my own prai[s]e. Forgive me, dear girl, this time, I will be careful how I offend again. March 7th . My entertainment la[s]t night, exceeded my mo[s]t [s]anguine expectations; the hou[s]e, the lights, the brilliant and numerous audience, on my fir[s]t entrance, filled me with [s]ilent a[s]toni[s]hment; but my cou[s]ins declare they never will go to the play with me again, for at the pathetic and intere[s]ting parts, I could not conceal my emotion. It was Jane Shore. Long did I [s]truggle to [s]uppre[s]s my tears; the effort was vain, and when in the la[s]t [s]cene, they drag the ju[s]t reconciled hu[s]band from the arms of his dying wife, the half [s]mothered [s]obs bur[s]t forth, and I fell back in an hy[s]teric. You cannot think, how I was laughed at, and my cou[s]ins declare they were [s]o [s]hocked at my behaviour, that they [s]hall be a[s]hamed to [s]hew their faces at the playhouse again this [s]ea[s]on. "One would think [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] child," [s]aid my aunt, in a peevi[s]h tone, as I began to recover, "you never had [s]een a play in your life before." "Well, you know I never did," [s]aid I, aloud. This compleated my di[s]grace, and my aunt turning toward the [s]tage, noticed me no more the whole evening. I think if I were to go again, I [s]hould like to [s]it in [s]ome unnoticed corner, where I could give [s]en[s]ibility the reins, and whil[s]t I wept the woes of tho[s]e who[s]e [s]orrows now re[s]t in the [s]ilent grave, I would [s]o mould my heart, as it [s]hould be ever ready to partake and alleviate the afflictions of tho[s]e who [s]till move on the bu[s]y [s]tage of life. One thing, my cou[s]ins informed me of, which con[s]iderably damped my plea[s]ure during the evening. They [s]aid, that many of the beautiful, elegant women, whom I [s]aw in the boxes, were the [s]laves of vice, and purcha[s]ed the gaudy trappings, by which they were adorned, by the wages of guilt; and that (but I can hardly think it po[s][s]ible) [s]ome of them are [s]o lo[s]t to every [s]en[s]e of virtue, that they come to tho[s]e public places with no other view than to attract new lovers; and what is [s]till wor[s]e, that in a few years; nay, perhaps even in a few months, I may [s]ee tho[s]e lovely blooming women walking the [s]treets, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] [s]ubject to the in[s]ults of every brutal pa[s][s]enger, and [s]inking into an untimely grave, under the complicated evils of poverty, [s]ickne[s]s and di[s]grace. I felt my eyes fill as He[s]ter concluded; and do you not pity them, [s]aid I: "La! cou[s]in," [s]aid [s]he, "you are the strangest girl; you make one laugh to [s]ee you now, with that long di[s]mal face, talking about pity for [s]uch wretches." "Perhaps," [s]aid I, "they had no friend to teach them better, and [s]urely, tho' we may [s]hudder with dete[s]tation at their vices, humanity [s]till leads us to pity their [s]ufferings." "You are as old fa[s]hioned in your notions, Meriel," [s]aid my aunt, who had overheard us, "as you are in your dre[s]s and manner. You will know better child when you have [s]een a little more of the world." I mu[s]t now quit my pen to a[s][s]i[s]t in [s]ome nece[s][s]ary dome[s]tic bu[s]ine[s]s.

When we got home, it was late, and all immediately retired to bed. I will confe[s]s it co[s]t me no little trouble to [s]tiflle the curio[s]ity that prompted me to open the letter. I put it in a drawer and turned the key; but, ju[s]t then recollecting that I wanted [s]omething that was in that identical drawer, I unlocked it again, took up the letter, read the addre[s]s, looked attentively if the wafer was dry; and, after viewing it on every [s]ide near a dozen times, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] re[s]olution at length repelled curio[s]ity, I returned it to the drawer and locked it again, without once recollecting why I had opened it the [s]econd time. In the morning I waited till we had done breakfa[s]t, and then putting the letter into my mother's hand, [s]aid, "I hope, my dear madam, this will convince you I would not willingly be guilty of an impropriety, or have a concealment of this nature from my be[s]t friend." She took it with a cold look of suspicion, and having read it, [s]aid "I [s]uppo[s]e you know the contents." "Indeed I do not," was the reply. "You can gue[s]s, I imagine," [s]aid [s]he; "no gentleman would have had the temerity to put a letter into a young lady's hand in [s]uch a clande[s]tine manner, had he not been pretty certain that it would not be refu[s]ed." "Good heavens!" [s]aid I, bur[s]ting into tears, "[s]hall I never regain your confidence? Mu[s]t every action, however innocent, be mi[s]con[s]trued or liable to [s]u[s]picion." "Why Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, "will you endeavour to per[s]uade me, Mr. Rainsforth has never entertained you on the subject of love." "If I may be believed madam," [s]aid I, with a firm voice, "he never uttered a [s]yllable to me that could be construed into more than common politene[s]s." "Well, child, read the letter then, and tell [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] me your opinion of the contents." I felt my face glow as I ca[s]t my eye over the letter, which contained a profe[s][s]ion of ardent affection and an offer of his hand, if my father approved the union. "You a[s]k my opinion, dear mother," [s]aid I, "and I will candidly give it; I think Mr. Rainsforth a very amiable young man, from what little I have [s]een, but it is impossible that I can form any ju[s]t idea of his character, from [s]o [s]hort an acquaintance; If when upon a greater intimacy, I [s]hould find him in reality po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of tho[s]e valuable qualifications, honour and benevolence, and my father and your[s]elf have no objection, I will not he[s]itate to confe[s]s, I could give him my hand, not only without reluctance, but with plea[s]ure." "But [s]uppo[s]e, Meriel, your father [s]hould object." "If you, madam, [s]hould al[s]o disapprove, I hope I know my duty too well to complain; [s]ince your knowledge of mankind in general, mu[s]t make you a much better judge of what will be really conducive to my happine[s]s, than I can po[s][s]ibly be my[s]elf; however, madam, if [s]uch objections [s]hould ari[s]e, I hope you will inform me [s]oon, that I may early begin to teach my heart a le[s][s]on which, [s]ome little time hence, I may find a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] difficulty in making it obey." My mother made no an[s]wer, and [s]oon after I left the room; in the afternoon Mr. Rainsforth called; I felt the colour flu[s]h to my face: when he entered he glanced his eyes toward me; but I believe they brought him no intelligence concerning the reception his letter had met with. He had not been [s]eated above ten minutes before my mother made [s]ome excu[s]e to [s]end me out of the room; I under[s]tood her perfectly, and was not in ha[s]te to return; in about an hour I was [s]ent for to make tea, but it was the mo[s]t un[s]ocial meal I had ever partaken of, when Rainsforth was pre[s]ent: he was [s]ilent; I was embarra[s][s]ed, and my father and mother, as is in general the ca[s]e, [s]poke to each other but little. When tea was over he took his leave, when my father acquainted me I had his permi[s][s]ion to recieve his addre[s][s]es; [s]aid he believed him a man of honour, and, if his friends rai[s]ed no objection to the union, he thought the [s]ooner it was compleated the better. Does not this eagerne[s]s to di[s]po[s]e of me, [s]hew how painful my pre[s]ence is to him? Indeed I do not wonder at it, we seldom like to be much in company with tho[s]e per[s]ons whom we are con[s]cious of having injured. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] And now, my dear Celia, you will perhaps wonder at my [s]o readily li[s]tening to an offer of marriage from a man with whom I have [s]o [s]mall an acquaintance, but indeed my [s]ituation at home is far from being agreeable. My mother's affections [s]eem totally alienated from me, and lavi[s]hed with redoubled tenderne[s]s on my brother, who, I am [s]orry to [s]ay, repays it with ingratitude and disrespect. He is continually teizing her for money, and tho' he is con[s]cious there is no [s]ource from whence that money can proceed, except from me, yet he is continually tormenting me by [s]ome ill natured trick or other. If we are in a mixed company, every word I utter is turned into ridicule. If I [s]it [s]ilent, then [s]i[s]ter is [s]tudying [s]omething clever to [s]ay; if I deliver my [s]entiments on any [s]ubject that excites my [s]en[s]ibility or veneration, then [s]i[s]ter is going to turn a sentimental actre[s]s, or a methodi[s]t preacher; even the re[s]pect I pay to my religious duties is an object of ridicule, in which my pretty cou[s]ins always join. If I expre[s]s my di[s]like of cards, gadding, and its attendant [s]candal, and my love of retirement, [s]tudy and dome[s]tic employment, then he wonders what Mrs. Mirvan could mean by leaving me a fortune, who could be [s]o well content with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] "---pounds three-[s]core, For meat and books, nor a[s]k for more." To which my aunt often replies, aye, Meriel would make an excellent poor man's wife; and the[s]e expre[s][s]ions often e[s]cape them before people, who think it degrading to be able to perform, for them[s]elves, any of the nece[s][s]ary offices of life; and would blu[s]h to death were they [s]uppo[s]ed to know how to make or mend their own linen; for my own part, I cannot help thinking, if tho[s]e fine ladies had a little more u[s]eful employment on their hands, they would not have [s]o much time to inve[s]tigate and expo[s]e the actions of their neighbours. You mu[s]t imagine, my dear girl, that I lead but an uncomfortable kind of life; and Mr. Rainsforth always [s]hews that attention to me, and takes my part, with [s]uch delicacy as mu[s]t unavoidably awaken my gratitude, if not my affection; and believe me, I now begin to feel the difference between a real attachment and the illu[s]ive wanderings of the heart. I know how to value the virtues of my lover, at the [s]ame time I feel a much [s]tronger inclination to act in all things with that propriety as may render me re[s]pected. I feel now the true value of reputation, honour and virtue, becau[s]e I entertain a hope of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] being one day united to a man, who[s]e character would be injured by my want of either: and, oh! my Celia, what a blu[s]h of confu[s]ion often [s]preads my cheeks, when I reflect on the letters I wrote to Pringle; how do I [s]hudder at the bare po[s][s]ibility of tho[s]e letters one day coming to the eye of Mr. Rainsforth. Wrote, as they were, at a time when my imagination was [s]o [s]trongly tinctured with the [s]tyle of the books I had been reading, that I almo[s]t involuntarily wrote the very [s]entiments which I had ju[s]t embibed, with all the enthu[s]ia[s]m of romantic affection. Ah! Celia, tho[s]e books drew very deceitful pictures of human life, their fal[s]e colouring had rai[s]ed my expectations and exalted my ideas, of love and friend[s]hip, far above any thing I can find in the little circle of acquaintance I have formed. Perhaps tho[s]e elevated [s]entiments and actions may be confined to people of an elevated [s]phere of life, for I never remember meeting with any hero or heroine of a [s]tory, but either were at fir[s]t, or afterwards proved to be per[s]ons of rank and fortune: but tho[s]e are people [s]o far above me, I can never hope to form any acquaintance with them. I [s]ee them daily pa[s]s me in their carriages, [s]urrounded with affluence, attended with re[s]pect; yet [s]urely if I know my own heart, I do not envy them, except, when I think of the power they [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] possess to cheer the poor wretch humbled by affliction, and to cau[s]e the broken heart to rejoice. Envy, did I [s]ay, oh! no, it is not envy, it is a [s]entiment I cannot find a name for, it is a wi[s]h to enjoy tho[s]e tran[s]porting feelings my[s]elf, without taking from their felicity; it is an earne[s]t de[s]ire to promote, not decrea[s]e, the happine[s]s of every human being. You, my Celia, [s]ecluded from the world, in devout retirement, can form but a faint idea of the many mi[s]eries with which this variegated world abounds. Yes, my friend, and there are plea[s]ures too, but they are not in general [s]uited to my ta[s]te. I hate a crowd; it may for a moment dazzle the [s]en[s]es, but it leaves no impre[s][s]ion on the heart. In my opinion, we cannot experience real plea[s]ure, if we are devoid of happine[s]s; and of this I am certain, happine[s]s can [s]eldom be drawn from external objects, but is [s]ure to dwell in the heart, con[s]cious of performing its duty. That [s]uch happine[s]s, may ever be your's and mine, prays your MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London May 17 th , 1776. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] Since my la[s]t, few incidents have happened, worthy the notice of my Celia, except that Mr. Rainsforth, being my declared lover, has a[s]toni[s]hed all my uncle's family. My mother [s]ays [s]he is [s]ure He[s]ter and Su[s]an are ready to bur[s]t with envy; I cannot think it. That dear woman has met with [s]o many painful incidents, in her way thro' life, that her naturally amiable temper, is [s]oured, and [s]he views every thing with a jaundiced eye. My cou[s]ins [s]eem highly delighted with the idea of an approaching wedding, and declare they will be my bride maids. They are mi[s]taken in thinking the wedding will be [s]o [s]oon, Mr. Rainsforth being obliged to join his [s]hip, which belongs to the grand fleet at Spithead, and I rather wi[s]h to remain [s]ingle till this [s]ummer's crui[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] is pa[s]t. If he returns [s]afe, I need not tell you with what joy I [s]hall fulfill my engagements: if not; if it be his fate to fall in the defence of his country, I will come to you my beloved Celia, and become a pen[s]ioner in the convent for life. My religion will not permit me to take the veil; but my vow of celibacy will be as [s]incere, breathed from my own heart to the great Judge of all our actions, as tho' I made at the foot of the altar, [s]urrounded by all the pomp of monki[s]h [s]uper[s]tition. Pardon me, my beloved friend, I mean no reflection on the religion you profess. I think that it is not the form but the heart that is an acceptable [s]acrifice: and the [s]oul that humbles it[s]elf before its Maker, and cries "pardon my numerous tran[s]gre[s][s]ions, I am but a worm before thee, the creature of thy infinite power: if thou [s]houlde[s]t forsake me, who will dare to be my friend; difpose of me as in thy wi[s]dom thou [s]halt think fit; I will not complain, but will take the lot appointed, with [s]ubmi[s][s]ion." That [s]oul, my Celia, let its form of wor[s]hip be what it may, will one day [s]hine re[s]plendent in the man[s]ion of its Creator. Oh! with what rapture can we approach the throne of mercy, when with a heart overflowing with gratitude, we can [s]ay, in the words of our admired Pope: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] "Teach me to feel another's woe, To hide the fault I [s]ee; That mercy I to others [s]how, That mercy [s]hew to me." But I know my Celia is as void of bigotry as [s]he is of every other error. As Mr. Rainsforth is now, I will not deny, the fir[s]t object of my e[s]teem, I mu[s]t inform you of the rea[s]ons which have by degrees con[s]pired to rai[s]e him thus in my opinion. The day after that mentioned in my la[s]t letter, I received one from him, a copy of which I have enclo[s]ed for your peru[s]al, al[s]o my answer, and his [s]econd letter. After you have read them, I think you will not blame my partiality. MERIEL. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD, (Enclo[s]ed in the foregoing.) MADAM, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] From a conver[s]ation I had lately with Mr. Howard, I find you have made your parents the confidants of a pa[s][s]ion, which I hardly dared venture to di[s]clo[s]e, even to the dear object who had excited it; and pardon me, if I [s]ay [s]ome peculiarities in the manner of both Mr. and Mrs. Howard, has been the cau[s]e of my not applying to them for leave to addre[s]s their lovely daughter; nor indeed, did I think it quite con[s]onant with the idea of female delicacy, to apply for the parents approbation, before I could flatter myself that approbation would be entirely agreeable to the per[s]on, who[s]e good will I am mo[s]t [s]olicitous to obtain. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] I thank you a thou[s]and times, dear, amiable young lady, for the [s]weet hope you have authori[s]ed your father to give me; your conduct has, if po[s][s]ible, rai[s]ed you in my e[s]teem; and I look forward with a certainty of felicity to the moment that [s]hall unite us by indi[s][s]oluble ties; for [s]ure a woman who has [s]o high a [s]en[s]e of filial duty, mu[s]t ever retain a proper idea of the equally incumbent duties which will ari[s]e from the married [s]tate; her hu[s]band's honour will be [s]afe in her hands; her children will look up to her as their friend, and ble[s][s]ings will attend her foot[s]teps wherever [s]he appears. Oh! beloved Mi[s]s Howard, my heart, that perfectly under[s]tands your virtues, exults in paying them the homage due. The simplicity of your manner fir[s]t charmed me, and pardon me if I [s]ay, I [s]aw not the charms of your per[s]on, till I had learnt to adore the goodness of your heart; to guard that heart from every approaching evil, [s]hall henceforth be my [s]tudy: if you will favour me with a few lines from your own hand, to [s]ay you do not refu[s]e me [s]o charming a guardian[s]hip, and to confirm me in the hope of being not quite indifferent to you, it will be acknowledged as the highe[s]t obligation, by your faithful FREDERIC RAINSFORTH. MISS HOWARD to MR. RAINSFORTH. SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] Gratitude will not [s]uffer me long to remain [s]ilent or inattentive, to a letter, the contents of which, [s]eem to breath only the [s]pirit of [s]incerity; nor will I hesitate to confe[s]s, that the liberty my parents have granted is perfectly con[s]onant with the feelings of my own heart. Every one who is honoured with the acquaintance of Mr. Rainsforth, mu[s]t be [s]en[s]ible of his worth, and to find one[s]elf the object of the tenderest e[s]teem, to a truely worthy man, mu[s]t certainly awaken a degree of laudable pride, in a bo[s]om not devoid of [s]en[s]ibility. Accept my [s]incere[s]t thanks for the many obliging [s]entiments you have expre[s][s]ed in my favour, and give me leave to mention a few circumstances with which you may be unacquainted, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] but which, I think it highly proper, you [s]hould be informed of. It is in general reported that I have four thou[s]and pounds for my fortune. This report is fal[s]e. I have only a fourth part of the [s]um. My godmother, Mrs. Mirvan, made the will in my favour, but with the[s]e re[s]trictions; that I [s]hould never [s]uffer my family to feel the nece[s][s]ities of life. At that time, Mr. Rainsforth, there was no pro[s]pect of their ever being reduced from a [s]tate of competency, to a dependence on their child; but [s]uch is the fluctuating [s]tate of human affairs, that this is exactly now the ca[s]e. This [s]tate of dependence is extremely painful to me, and I am [s]ure mu[s]t be [s]o to them. It is, therefore, my fixed determination, when I am of age, to [s]ettle the moiety of my fortune on my mother. I am under engagements for my father at pre[s]ent to the amount of five hundred pounds, and the other five hundred mu[s]t be appropriated to the u[s]e of my brother, during his clerk[s]hip, and to help him forward a little when that is expired. This di[s]po[s]ition of my little fortune, may make a material difference in your plans of life for the future, and I thought it but right to inform you, that no intere[s]t of my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] own, [s]hall ever induce me to alter my resolution. If you think me [s]till worthy of your attentions, I am your's. Do not [s]mile at my frankne[s]s, I have not yet learnt to di[s]gui[s]e the feelings of my heart. Do not he[s]itate to give a candid an[s]wer. If the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thou[s]and pounds, [s]eek not to excu[s]e your[s]elf for withdrawing your addre[s][s]es, I will not even require an apology for a conduct, to which I am certain, nothing but the mo[s]t powerful rea[s]ons, could have forced you. I am, Sir, your friend and humble [s]ervant, MERIEL HOWARD. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] Shall I not chide you, my dear Mi[s]s Howard; [s]hall I not tell you what I felt at the reception of your dear unkind letter. Dear it will ever be to my fond bo[s]om, becau[s]e in the [s]incerity of your language, I could read the affection of your heart. "Smile at your frankne[s]s;" how could you think of [s]uch a thing. No, I adore you for it, and [s]urely the man who could de[s]pi[s]e a heart for its [s]incerity, de[s]erves not to possess [s]o invaluable a ble[s][s]ing. May Mi[s]s Howard never learn to di[s]gui[s]e feelings which, cha[s]tened as they are, by honour and feminine delicacy, become an honour to the heart; but [s]till I mu[s]t chide. What could you think, when you [s]ay, "if the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thou[s]and pounds." Unkind Meriel, do you [s]uppo[s]e millions could increa[s]e my love, or could they make [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] you more valuable. No, they could not; therefore, di[s]po[s]e of your fortune in any manner you [s]hall think fit, give me only your[s]elf, and I [s]hall think I po[s][s]e[s]s a jewel, which worlds could not purcha[s]e. I am every day expecting orders to join the fleet. Will you, my dear Mi[s]s Howard, pardon my impatience, if I wi[s]h to call you mine before the[s]e orders arrive. I [s]hall have a thou[s]and doubts and fears if I leave you before we are irrevocably united. Perhaps [s]ome one more worthy; Oh! forgive my [s]u[s]picions, but who can love and not fear to lo[s]e the object of their fonde[s]t hopes. Methinks could I once call you mine, the thought would in[s]pire me with courage. Should I be called into action again[s]t the enemy of my country, honour, ambition, thir[s]t of fame [s]hould all give way to love. For you alone would I fight, for your [s]ake alone wi[s]h to conquer, and your love [s]hould be the reward of all my toils. I will [s]pend an hour with you to-morrow evening. Oh! my [s]weet friend, let your mild eyes tell me, at meeting, you cannot refuse the ardent prayer of your ever faithful FREDERIC RAINSFORTH. MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.) [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] But I did refu[s]e him, Celia, tho' my little rebellious heart would have fain played the traitor. Be [s]till, little fool, [s]aid I, Meriel will learn to be thy mi[s]tre[s]s: think not, by thy flutterings and throbings, to counteract re[s]olutions which rea[s]on tells me are right and laudable. So, my dear girl, I per[s]evered in the determination of not giving Rainsforth my hand, till the [s]ummer's crui[s]e was over, and he was obliged to submit with as good a grace as he could, tho' I a[s][s]ure you, he looked quite blank upon it. And now, my dear girl, I will give you my rea[s]ons for thus ob[s]tinately oppo[s]ing the proposed union. You know I [s]hall be eighteen in September, when being mi[s]tre[s]s of my fortune, I may di[s]po[s]e of it as I have already de[s]igned, without being an[s]werable to any one. Now, if I marry fir[s]t, I certainly make my hu[s]band ma[s]ter, not only of my[s]elf, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] of all I po[s][s]e[s]s; and how do I know what objections may ari[s]e on his part in the cour[s]e of a few months. I do not mean, that I doubt Rainsforth's genero[s]ity; but a change of circum[s]tances produces a change of ideas, and I think it is be[s]t not to tru[s]t too much to the firmne[s]s of our own hearts. My aunt laughed the other day, and [s]aid [s]he que[s]tioned if I [s]hould ever be married, for ab[s]ence and [s]alt water are in general a cure for love. It may prove [s]o with [s]ome, but I do not much fear the con[s]tancy of a man, who braves even the [s]haft of ridicule, by openly avowing me the woman of his choice; for I can [s]ee many a [s]neering [s]mile, glance from my aunt to her [s]on, whenever they are witne[s]s to his attention to your Meriel. My father and mother [s]eem totally regardless, whether I am married now, or when he returns; and I believe, if the truth was known, are very little concerned about my future welfare. But yet, Celia, my bo[s]om cannot forget its natural affections, or dive[s]t it[s]elf of tho[s]e [s]trong [s]en[s]ations of duty, love and veneration, which ever have warmed it, [s]ince my infant tongue fir[s]t li[s]p'd the tender name of mother. As to my father, I cannot [s]ay I feel any emotions in his favour, nor can it be expected I [s]hould, after the [s]cenes which I have imparted to you, the horrors [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] of which will never be removed from my mind. Alas! they often recur to my imagination and ca[s]t a gloom over every ri[s]ing plea[s]ure. Yet, as a man who[s]e happine[s]s is nearly connected with my mother's; as the man whom nature requires me to regard, I will pay him every nece[s][s]ary re[s]pect, and as far as the narrow limits of my power will permit, will promote his intere[s]t and felicity. May 19 th . Celia, he is gone; I have this moment bade him farewell. I feel there are moments when all the fortitude, we boa[s]t, [s]inks into nothing oppo[s]ed to the [s]truggles of nature; would you believe it, at the moment when I [s]aw him [s]tep into the chai[s]e, I would have given worlds, had I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed them, to have been his wife, that I might have gone with him, beheld him to the very la[s]t moment of embarkation, and even then have [s]tood on the [s]hore to catch a la[s]t look at the expanded [s]ails which bore him from me, till by degrees they le[s][s]ened to my view, and at length were lo[s]t in the va[s]t horizon. My aunt and cou[s]ins where with us drinking tea; Rainsforth came in, when I in[s]tantly [s]aw [s]omething was the matter. The order is at length arrived, [s]aid I, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] mentally, and he comes to bid me adieu; I handed him a cup of tea, he put it to his lips but did not ta[s]te it. "I am come Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, "to take my leave; the fleet [s]ails in a few days." "Do you go this evening," [s]aid my mother. "In a few moments, madam," [s]aid he, "I ju[s]t recieved the letter, and accidently met with two brother officers, who were going in a chai[s]e, and gladly accepted me as a third; we mean to take two [s]tages to night, and [s]hall be in Port[s]mouth by to-morrow noon." At that moment the chai[s]e [s]topped at the door. Rainsforth ro[s]e, bowed to my aunt and cou[s]ins, thanked them for all civilities, wi[s]hed my father and mother health, and then turned toward me. My heart was full, [s]o was his; we neither of us [s]poke; he pre[s][s]ed my hands to his lips, bowed low to hide his emotions, and was in the chai[s]e in an in[s]tant. I knew [s]en[s]ibility would be deemed weakne[s]s by tho[s]e who were witne[s]s to our parting; I therefore [s]truggled to [s]uppre[s]s my ri[s]ing tears, offered up a [s]ilent prayer for his [s]afe return, and endeavoured at a look of composure, that was very foreign to my heart. What may be his fate, heaven alone can tell; yet [s]ure if worth is its peculiar care, he will not only be protected in this, but in every other danger. But alas! Celia, how [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] often do we [s]ee merit cut off in its full prime, whil[s]t the unworthy are [s]pared. Surely, when the brave and good fall in their country's cau[s]e, it mu[s]t be that their virtues merit [s]uch rewards as only heaven can give. They are [s]uffered to appear on the va[s]t theatre of life, to act a little while bright [s]hining parts, and then are called home to receive the glorious mead of heavenly and uncea[s]ing joys. My mind dwelling on this [s]ubject the other evening, (you know I am fond of indulging in little effusions of poetry,) and painting to my[s]elf the [s]ituation of a [s]oldier's wife, who has followed her hu[s]band to the very [s]cene of battle, and in the morn, [s]ending him forth to brave the ho[s]tile foe, at night [s]ees him covered with wounds and in the agonies of death; I for a moment fancied my[s]elf in her [s]ituation, and wrote the following trifle. I [s]end it to my Celia without an apology, becau[s]e trifles become valuable when they proceed from the friend we love. MERIEL.

Henry tho' dying knew his Anna's voice, Cried, "dry tho[s]e tears, my Anna and rejoice; For tho' I'm lo[s]t to thee, yet future [s]tory, Shall tell, thy Henry liv'd and died with glory.

He will not be content to remain where he has been placed, but has taken it into his wi[s]e head that he mu[s]t go to [s]ea; nothing el[s]e will [s]uit him, he cannot, he [s]ays, be confined to the drudgery of a countinghouse, where a per[s]on may toil all their lives and ri[s]e to nothing above mediocrity. He will go to [s]ea, where, with one bold pu[s]h, it often happens that a man gains both honour and fortune. The lad [s]eems to be po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of the [s]pirit of ambition, yet not that laudable ambition which acts as a [s]timulus to actions great and prai[s]e worthy. It is power and wealth he aims at, and be the [s]teps ever [s]o dirty, by which he mu[s]t arrive at the de[s]ired eminence, I much fear he would not he[s]itate to wade thro' thick and thin.

I wi[s]h to my [s]oul an intimate acquaintance with this worthy man, may be of [s]ervice to him, for we often in[s]en[s]ibly imbibe the [s]entiments of tho[s]e with whom we a[s][s]ociate. My father, I fear, is running into his old errors; he has formed an acquaintance with a Mr. Dell, which in my opinion bodes no good. Dell appears much of the gentleman in his manner, but young Mo[s][s]op [s]ays he is a pro[s]e[s][s]ed gambler, and I am rather inclined to believe this a[s][s]ertion, as my father is frequently out with him till three or four in the morning, and has drained us [s]o of money, that we have not a [s]ingle guinea for hou[s]e expences; this will occa[s]ion our getting into debt, and I am afraid my father has already borrowed money on the [s]trength of my promi[s]e, in regard to my fortune; if [s]o all my endeavours to pre[s]erve my mother from want will be ineffectual. This Dell has a wife, whom he once brought to [s]pend an afternoon with us; I do not like her; there was [s]omething in her dre[s]s and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] manner, bold, forward and di[s]gu[s]ting; [s]he has been pretty, and is vain enough to think [s]he is [s]o now. My mother does not admire her any more than my[s]elf, and only that [s]he thinks it would highly di[s]oblige my father, [s]he would by no means either recieve or return her vi[s]its. Another [s]ource of unhappine[s]s to this dear [s]uffering woman is my father's giving way to a habit of drinking, for he is almo[s]t continually intoxicated, and [s]o extremely captious and ill natured that it is next to impossible to [s]ay or do any thing to plea[s]e him. Poor dear mother how my heart bleeds for your afflictions; how many years have you pa[s]t wherein you can [s]carcely [s]ay, you have [s]een one happy hour; and could I, but lead you to repo[s]e your [s]orrows on the bo[s]om of your child! but no, you think that child unworthy of your love, unworthy your confidence; and [s]he dares not clear her[s]elf, le[s]t by endeavouring to remove one [s]orrow from your heart, [s]he [s]hould throw another on it that would cru[s]h you with its weight. I have heard from Rainsforth but once [s]ince the fleet [s]ailed. Oh! Celia, [s]hould he one day afflict my heart, by har[s]hne[s]s, cruelty or infidelity; ah! my friend, if the thought thus wrings my bo[s]om, what would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] the reality do; and yet, I would endeavour to bear it with the meekne[s]s of a wife, and the fortitude of a chri[s]tian; but me thinks I would wi[s]h to [s]ink at once under the dreadful certainty; doubt and [s]u[s]picion would torture me to the very utmo[s]t of my [s]trength to bear, but to be convinced I had out lived his affection, mu[s]t, I am convinced, be instant death or madne[s]s. My letters have now nothing intere[s]ting in them; Indeed, Celia, I begin to think every thing in[s]ipid and tire[s]ome, that is not concerning Rainsforth; even reading no more amu[s]es. If I read of a worthy character, [s]uch a one I cry is my Frederic; then I drop the book to mu[s]e upon his virtues, and if I take up my pen I can write but an invocation to heaven for his [s]afety. The only relief I find is in con[s]tant employment, and therefore, I [s]eldom pa[s]s an idle hour, my needle, my pencil, and my dome[s]tic concerns, plea[s]ingly variegate the [s]cene, and prevent my complaining of la[s][s]itude. I go out but little, and [s]ee but few vi[s]itors, my cou[s]ins indeed frequently call, but as I do not mix in the [s]ame gay circles they do, I can join but little in their conver[s]ation; they tell me many lively anecdotes that amu[s]e me; I li[s]ten to their account of a ball, a concert, or any other fa[s]hionable amu[s]ement [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] with a [s]mile, becau[s]e it gives me plea[s]ure to [s]ee them happy. My mother [s]ays they give me the[s]e accounts only to mortify me; if [s]o, they greatly mi[s]s their aim; I feel no inclination to mix in the giddy throng of the votaries to plea[s]ure. Nature never de[s]igned me for dre[s]s, bu[s]tle, and parade; my highest wi[s]h is to [s]teal thro' life unnoticed, but by the friends I love, and to die before I know their lo[s]s or the privation of their esteem.

You never formed a wi[s]h beyond the narrow bounds pre[s]cribed by your mona[s]tic rules.

And is it, do you a[s]k, a happine[s]s to be deprived of tho[s]e [s]weet sensations?

But I am a beggar, and [s]hall I marry thee, my deare[s]t girl, and bring a wretched race of innocents into a life of penury and woe. Shall I lead my gentle Meriel to the altar, when I am certain our only patrimony will be want and mi[s]ery. Oh no! humanity! honor! love! forbid it. My father is a bankrupt, nor has he [s]aved enough from the wreck of his fortune to support even for a few months, his wife and three [s]mall children: and [s]hall not I, who received from him life, education, every valuable gift: [s]hall not I prefer his happine[s]s to my own? Yes, my adored Meriel, I will, dear as thou art to this fond doating heart; I will renounce even thee, and devote my little income to the [s]upport of my father and his family.

MISS HOWARD TO MR. RAINSFORTH. -  London November 16 th , 1776. " Adieu , forever," did you [s]ay: no, Rainsforth, no! we [s]hall yet meet many times, our [s]ouls are congenial; they [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] were animated the by [s]ame [s]park of intellectual fire, and tho' we cannot claim a nearer tie, we [s]hall be friends to the late[s]t hour of our exi[s]tence. My generous, noble friend, I do not blu[s]h to [s]ay my e[s]teem, (nay call it love, if you will) is increa[s]ed by this proof of your magnanimity; call it not a re[s]ignation, I am your's I will never be another's; unle[s]s I can find one your [s]uperior in every virtue, that can exalt and dignify human nature, and in [s]aying that, I think I am irrevocably bound to you. There may be men who po[s][s]e[s]s equal goodne[s]s of heart, but there can be none who can boa[s]t a [s]uperiority. I am [s]en[s]ibly affected at your father's misfortunes; would to heaven it was in my power to remove every affliction far from him. Not [s]o much from the idea that his troubles have interrupted my happine[s]s; but that I am certain your feeling heart suffers tho[s]e misfortunes doubly, in [s]eeing them inflicted on one [s]o de[s]ervedly dear to you. But let us look forward my friend; the pro[s]pect is not [s]o dark, but that the [s]un of pro[s]perity may yet brake forth to enliven it; you may yet live to [s]ee your father reinstated in the afluence, from which he is at present removed by an all-wife Providence, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] only to teach him the value of pa[s]t ble[s][s]ings. We never know rightly, how to prize a benefit, till we have known what it is to lo[s]e it; I write feelingly Rainsforth, for, I knew not half your worth till the very moment that I [s]aw an in[s]uperable barrier placed between us, and now I wi[s]h I had li[s]tened to your solicitations, for then at this moment I might have admini[s]tered comfort to your drooping spirits, and a[s][s]i[s]ted in the delightful ta[s]k of [s]oothing the [s]orrows of your parents. But why [s]hould I be [s]o [s]elfi[s]h, the plea[s]ure would have been all my own; for [s]ure I knew your generous heart too well, to [s]uppo[s]e it would not have [s]uffered from the idea of my [s]haring in afflictions, which could not have been prevented, and hardly admit of any aleviation. To [s]ay I felt nothing when I read your pathetic letter, would be to pronounce my[s]elf in[s]en[s]ible. Believe me, I felt all; nay, perhaps more than you could have wi[s]hed; however, of this be a[s][s]ured, that nothing but a total change in you can occation any alteration in my [s]entiments. If it will be more conducive to your happine[s]s; here let the corre[s]pondence cea[s]e, and [s]hould you hereafter meet a woman, who[s]e merits and fortune render her worthy your attachment; may you be as happy in the union [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] as the lot of mortallity will allow.

I know you will [s]ay I am pur[s]uing my notions of filial duty now to imprudence; I fear I am, and yet, my dear Celia, were you situated as I am, I [s]o well know your heart, that I am certain you would have conducted your[s]elf exactly in the [s]ame manner. About three days [s]ince, a gentleman called and pre[s]ented a bill for payment, drawn by my brother, who had given my mother notice of his de[s]ign; but [s]he, fearful of mentioning it, as [s]he had no means of answering the demand, had kept it to her[s]elf. It was for an hundred pounds. Ungenerous lad! when he knew how narrow our circumstances were, and how much his incon[s]i[s]tent conduct had embarra[s][s]ed us. When the man brought the bill, my poor mother turned pale as a[s]hes. "What is the matter, madam," [s]aid I. She called me into the next room, and putting the bill into my hand, (for it was [s]ome days after [s]ight) [s]he [s]aid, "what mu[s]t I do." "Indeed my dear madam," I replied, "I cannot tell. It is not in my power to do any more, the bill mu[s]t be prote[s]ted, and I hope it will teach him frugality in future. I am [s]ure he mu[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] have been very extravagant, or he never could have wanted money [s]o [s]oon, considering the [s]um he took with him." She made me no an[s]wer, but bur[s]ting into tears cried, "then all is over, my poor Richard." I never can [s]ee my mother in affliction, but my heart yearns [s]pontaniou[s]ly to fly to her relief. How then could I behold her tears unmoved, how hold back that comfort [s]he required, when [s]he thus continued to addre[s]s me. "I know, Meriel, we have almo[s]t reduced you to beggary, I am fully [s]en[s]ible how much we owe to your genero[s]ity." "Dear, dear mother, talk not [s]o," [s]aid I, throwing my arms about her, "I have done nothing but my duty, and I think it [s]till my duty to pre[s]erve the remainder of my fortune, to comfort you in your declining age." "But think of your brother, Meriel," cried [s]he eagerly, "think my dear girl, what [s]traits he may reduced to in a foreign land. If this bill is not paid, my poor boy will be thrown into pri[s]on, and be lo[s]t for want of a friend to comfort him. Oh! Meriel, refuse not your mother this one reque[s]t." And ah! my Celia, may I never meet [s]uch another trial. The dear woman knelt; yes, my mother knelt to me before I had the time or power to prevent her. "Good heavens!" [s]aid I, "this is too much, take me, dear mother, do with me and mine as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] you think proper, only I be[s]eech you do not let me be thus humiliated. 'Tis I [s]hould have knelt to you, oh! ri[s]e, and do not thus di[s]tre[s]s me. I will pay the bill." The next day I took up money [s]ufficient for that purpo[s]e, and al[s]o to di[s]charge [s]ome [s]ew debts in the neighbourhood, [s]o that our income is now [s]o reduced that I mu[s]t be obliged to turn my thoughts towards [s]ome genteel employment, however repugnant it is to my father and mother's inclinations. In my opinion, the per[s]on who has talents, health and [s]pirits to earn a [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, is in all re[s]pects independent, and there is nothing to me would be more painful, than to eat the bread of indolence. Pride may teach another le[s][s]on, but then it is not the pride which elevates the human heart. It [s]hall be ever my pride to keep free from obligation. It is always a painful [s]en[s]e, but more e[s]pecially when we have no power to return it. Let my habitation be ever [s]o humble, and my fare ever [s]o coar[s]e, if they are the fruits of my own indu[s]try, they will be [s]weeter, more comfortable by far, than the greate[s]t luxuries purcha[s]ed by the cringe of [s]ervility.

I shewed her Rainsforth's letter in the fullne[s]s of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] my heart, and claimed her promi[s]e of being bride maid. I thought [s]he did not look plea[s]ed and hurried away very [s]oon after [s]he had read the letter. I [s]hall make but little preparation again[s]t his arrival. I know he regards me only for my[s]elf, and alas! that is all I now have to be[s]tow. Two days more and I [s]hall [s]ee him; think me not weak, if I tell you I [s]hall count the hours with impatience. After a [s]eperation of near two years, how plea[s]ing to meet a friend whom we know to be [s]o worthy, and whom we had given up as lo[s]t. Farewell, my dear Celia, your plea[s]ures are all of the calm unruffled kind, like the [s]mooth [s]tream that glides beneath a lofty bank, by which it is defended from the rude bla[s]ts of wind. It continues one gentle unvaried cour[s]e, and its charms can neither be increa[s]ed or diminished. MERIEL. [1] Between this and the foregoing letter, there are several omitted, which pa[s][s]ed between Mi[s]s Howard and her friend. As they contained nothing but complaints of Mr. Howard's behaviour, and an account of young Howard's going to India, on a three year's [s]tation. This occa[s]ions a [s]pace of eighteen months. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London May 19 th , 1778.

I will decieve my[s]elf no longer, nothing but death, or extreme illne[s]s could have kept him from me, tho' I have been told that he meant from the fir[s]t to decieve me, and that my ea[s]y fondne[s]s has been a theme for ridcule for him and his gay companions. But I cannot believe it, Celia, if he is fal[s]e, where [s]hall we find a man worthy to be e[s]teemed. No, Rainsforth, there certainly mu[s]t be [s]ome very urgent cau[s]e for this ab[s]ence, this, I had almo[s]t [s]aid, cruel [s]ilence; but I will not give up the opinion I have formed of your integrity. May 20 th . Celia, I am ill, very ill, my heart has recieved a [s]hock it will never recover; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v1&image=328-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] Rainsforth is married! married to another, and within a fortnight after the day appointed to unite him to me. My cou[s]in He[s]ter called on me ye[s]terday to take a walk; we called on a lady of her acquaintance who has a [s]i[s]ter married at Plymouth, for He[s]ter [s]ugge[s]ted that through her means we might gain [s]ome intelligence concerning Rainsforth. After the u[s]ual ceremonies, when we were [s]eated, He[s]ter enquired when [s]he had heard from her [s]i[s]ter, "I had a letter ye[s]terday," [s]he replied, "Kitty has been very gay, I a[s][s]ure you, they have had great doings at Plymouth, Mi[s]s Kingly, the great heire[s]s, was married la[s]t Monday, and Kitty was at the wedding." "And pray who is [s]he married to?" [s]aid He[s]ter. "A young officer in the navy," [s]he replied, "whom [s]he has been fond of for [s]ome time; I really forget his name, but there is the letter, you may read the whole account." I do not know how I [s]upported myself, while I ca[s]t my eye over the letter, as my cou[s]in held it in her hand, but I caught the name of Rainsforth; my head grew giddy, I turned cold and faint; but by the exertion of my re[s]olution avoided making my[s]elf ridiculous.
