[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-500.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] I continued in this [s]ituation but a few moments---when I heard a faint voice call "Meriel," I turned my head and [s]aw Kingly emerging from the [s]ea and holding by part of the wreck---"Oh, Heavens!" [s]aid I, "are you alive then, and is there any chance of e[s]caping?"---"Some little chance," [s]aid he, coming near me and beginning to nutie the cord that was round me. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-501.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] "But where is Mrs. Kingly?"---"Safe, I hope," he replied, "I have conveyed her on board a coa[s]ting ve[s][s]el, which you may [s]ee at no great di[s]tance from us; but which cannot come nearer on account of the wind blowing [s]trong in [s]hore, and the [s]ea running [s]o high a boat could not live in it. Come, my dear Meriel, throw off the mo[s]t cumbrous part of your dre[s]s, the chance of [s]aving you is but very [s]mall; yet, [s]hould I be [s]o happy, I [s]hall e[s]teem my[s]elf ble[s]t beyond expre[s][s]ion, and [s]hould I fail, I [s]hall at lea[s]t have the [s]atisfaction of dying with the only woman I ever loved with ardency and [s]incerity." "No, Kingly," [s]aid I, "if my life can only be pre[s]erved at the hazard of your's, leave me, I be[s]eech you, to my fate. I am a poor forlorn creature of no con[s]equence to any one:---here let me lay down the burthen of painful exi[s]tence!---Do you return to your amiable wife. You may alone [s]urvive the fury of the waves; but encumbered with me, it will be impo[s][s]ible. Go, my kind, my dear friend, be a father to my child, and [s]ometimes think on her unhappy mother." "Cea[s]e, dear Meriel, cea[s]e, thus to wound my heart, and trifle with the precious moments in which I may [s]natch you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-502.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] from impending death. I once had fondly hoped to live only to render you happy;--- but [s]ince fate has ordered it otherwi[s]e, I will pre[s]erve your life or peri[s]h in the attempt." "Oh Kingly," I replied, "leave me, let me die while I am innocent. This generous conduct awakens all the [s]oftne[s]s of my [s]oul, and [s]hould I live, I [s]hall live only to endure the tortures of hopele[s]s love, rendered doubly agonizing by the pang of conscious guilt." "Deare[s]t, be[s]t of women," [s]aid he, "let me but pre[s]erve you, and certain I am that the rectitude of the heart that can harbour [s]uch fears will ever pre[s]erve you from the guilt it dreads." The wind now [s]eemed a little to abate. I plainly [s]aw the ve[s][s]el coming nearer--- "Now is the time," [s]aid he, almo[s]t forcibly tearing off my upper garments, and binding a long [s]hawl tight round my wai[s]t, he fa[s]tened it to his arm, and catching me up plunged into the water. I now became once more in[s]en[s]ible, nor do I remember the lea[s]t circum[s]tance that followed, till I awoke, as it were, from a profound [s]leep, and found my[s]elf in a bed on board a [s]mall dirty [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-503.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] vessel. I rai[s]ed my head from the pillow and the fir[s]t object which met my eyes, was Kingly on the oppo[s]ite [s]ide of the cabin, apparently dead.---Mrs. Kingly with a pale haggard countenance hanging over him; and [s]tretched on a mattre[s]s, which was [s]pread on the cabin floor, lay Clara and Rook[s]by ju[s]t recovering from a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility. Weak as I was I de[s]ired to be lifted from the bed and crawling to that on which my pre[s]erver lay, I began to enquire what means had been u[s]ed for his recovery. I found every proper, every probable method had been tried without effect; they al[s]o informed me, that he was alive, when they took us up, but immediately on his getting on board, nature exhau[s]ted with the exertions he had made to [s]ave me, had given way at once, and he [s]unk lifele[s]s on the deck. Tortured almo[s]t to madne[s]s by this account, I entreated them to renew their applications---nay, weak and exhau[s]ted as we were, both Mrs. Kingly and my[s]elf joined our endeavours, while Rook[s]by and Clara drank a little brandy and water, and being covered up warm, fell into a profound [s]leep. For more than two hours we continued our applications without the lea[s]t appearance of [s]ucce[s]s; at length I was convinced I felt a faint palpitation of the heart. I mentioned my hopes to his wife, who thought the [s]ame. This [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-504.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] gave us fre[s]h courage, and in le[s]s than another hour we had the [s]uperlative felicity of [s]eeing him open his eyes. The rapturous expre[s][s]ions of joy that bur[s]t from Mrs. Kingly on this token of returning animation are better imagined than de[s]cribed, nor was mine far [s]hort of what [s]he expre[s][s]ed.--- No [s]ooner were we a[s]certained of perfect [s]ucce[s]s by his gently pre[s][s]ing our hands and faintly articulating, "God ble[s]s you both," than bur[s]ting into tears of the mo[s]t exulting rapture, we [s]unk on our knees, and as we wept on each others bo[s]om, poured forth our thanks to that benignant Power, who had crowned our humble exertions with [s]ucce[s]s. Never Celia! no never! till that moment did I fully comprehend what real joy was: the tide of delight that ru[s]hed upon my heart when I heard him articulate the words "God ble[s]s you," more than compen[s]ated for all the angui[s]h I had ever endured. The ve[s][s]el which had taken us up, was bound to Calais, whither it now bent its cour[s]e; the elements growing much calmer, and the wind becoming more favourable, and we were once more [s]afe on Terra Firma by three o'clock the next day. I find the place, on which we were wrecked is a dangerous reef on the Suffex coa[s]t, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-505.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] fortunately, only one life was lo[s]t and that was poor Le[s]ter, as the ve[s][s]el which pre[s]erved us [s]eeing our di[s]tre[s]s came as near as they po[s][s]ibly could in hopes of rendering us [s]ome a[s][s]i[s]tance; Rook[s]by is an expert [s]wimmer and Clara a woman of intrepid [s]pirit. We re[s]olved on [s]taying a day or two at Calais to recruit our [s]pirits. Indeed we all found our[s]elves a[s]toni[s]hingly recovered after a good nights re[s]t, except Mrs. Kingly, who appeared weak and languid, was unable to [s]it up and in the cour[s]e of the day was [s]eized with alarming faintings. Medical a[s][s]i[s]tance was called in, but they declared her frame had received [s]o [s]evere a [s]hock that in all human probability [s]he would fall into a rapid decline; however change of [s]cene, chearful company, and invigorating medicines might prove great re[s]toratives.---This was a heavy [s]troke to poor Kingly. We were unable to [s]tay any longer than the next day with him and it was evident that his Margaret would not be able to travel [s]o early. But there was no alternative; my mother's danger pre[s][s]ed us to pur[s]ue our journey, and accordingly the next morning we took leave of the drooping patient angel, and her afflicted hu[s]band, and [s]et forward for Aix, flattering our[s]elves that a few days would bring them to join us. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-506.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] On our arrival at Aix, Clara left us, and we proceeded to my mother's. Amelia met us at the door. "Is [s]he yet alive?" [s]aid I eagerly pre[s][s]ing forward. "She is," replied Amelia, but greatly di[s]tre[s][s]ed. "We heard a packet was lo[s]t and feared it was the one in which you had embarked."---Before I could an[s]wer I found my[s]elf in Mrs. Rook[s]by's chamber. The dear woman held out her hand to me as I entered; but was unable to [s]peak. Rook[s]by approached her bed-[s]ide, took her other hand, and pre[s][s]ed it to his lips with reverence; but we all remained silent, I was plea[s]ed to [s]ee he [s]till retained [s]en[s]ibility enough to be [s]hocked at his mother's altered appearance. When [s]he was a little recovered, "my dear children," [s]aid [s]he, pre[s][s]ing our hands, "it diffu[s]es a transient gleam of plea[s]ure over my heart to [s]ee you once more, and to [s]ee you [s]afe and happy; how have you left my [s]weet Clementina, was [s]he well? does [s]he remember her grandmother?"--- I a[s][s]ured her [s]he was in health, and if any thing could remain on her infant mind, it mu[s]t be the [s]en[s]e of her grandmother's kindne[s]s and affection.---She [s]miled approbation, then turning to Rook[s]by--- "Clement," [s]aid [s]he, "you are arrived in good time to clo[s]e my eyes and to [s]mooth my pa[s][s]age to the grave, by pa[s][s]ing an act of amne[s]ty with your amiable relation Captain [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-507.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] On[s]low. Come, promi[s]e me that the trifling cau[s]e of your di[s]pute [s]hall be no more remembered, and that you will rank him among the choice[s]t of your friends. I know he longs to convince you, that his affection toward you is unaltered." "Your wi[s]h, my dear madam," he replied, "mu[s]t be to me a law. All our former differences are from this moment forgotten."--- "'Tis well," [s]aid [s]he; "then to-morrow I hope to [s]ee my dear Mi[s]s Sidney exchange the name of virgin for that of wife. I [s]hall then have nothing more to wi[s]h in this world. Amelia made no affected objections to this propo[s]al, and that evening Captain On[s]low took his tea with us. When the articles were [s]igned, in which he [s]ettles on my dear Amelia, five thou[s]and pounds, which was the beque[s]t Mrs. Rook[s]by mentioned to have made in her will; he al[s]o pre[s]ented her with a very hand[s]ome watch, a pair of bracelets [s]at with brilliants and a pair of diamond earings. The next morning [s]he accepted his hand at the altar with that mode[s]t reserve, free from every prudi[s]h affectation of ba[s]hfulne[s]s, which ever di[s]tingui[s]hes the real woman of [s]en[s]e. From that time no material occurrence took place for three or four days; only that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-508.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] I ob[s]erved my mother [s]eemed more chearful, and I flattered my[s]elf that our united attentions might contribute to her re[s]toration, I carefully concealed not only from her, but even from Amelia, the cau[s]e I had for sorrow, as I knew it would pain their friendly hearts, without in the lea[s]t relieving the anguish of my own; though I knew by the frequent and long ab[s]ences of Rook[s]ky, that the chief part of his time was devoted to Clara. But why, thought I, [s]hould I give my dear Amelia a bad opinion of a [s]tate, into which [s]he had ju[s]t entered, by revealing to her the art, the duplicity cruelty and perfidy of which man is capable. Will it not lead her to fear a future change in the hu[s]band, who is now [s]o fondly attached to her. Was not Rook[s]by once as fond of me, Oh! had he been like Kingly, hither tended all my reflections on the [s]ubject, I was terrified to find my[s]elf making the[s]e compari[s]ons and [s]trenuou[s]ly endeavoured to cha[s]e from my mind the only object on which it could dwell with delight and grateful tenderne[s]s. But the[s]e ideas were [s]oon interrupted by the intru[s]ion of [s]ome [s]till more painful. My dear Mother was one morning [s]eized with a fit of coughing and expired before I could reach her apartment, though I was called the in[s]tant the attendants perceived her danger, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-509.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] though her death was hourly expected by tho[s]e about her, I had vainly [s]lattered my[s]elf [s]he might recover; I therefore felt her [s]udden departure the more [s]everely, and as if my heart was not already overcharged with affliction on the [s]econd day after her decea[s]e, Amelia entered my apartment with a letter open in her hand. There was an air of melancholy and [s]urpri[s]e about her countenance, which awakened my curio[s]ity. My thoughts in[s]tantly reverted to England and my child. "Is Clementina ill"---cried I, eagerly, [s]natching at the letter.---"No!" [s]he replied, folding it up and putting it in her pocket, while [s]he calmly [s]eated her[s]elf be[s]ide me, "the letter is not from England."--- "Are you [s]ure of that Amelia," [s]aid I, looking at her with a [s]crutinizing eye. "Perfectly [s]o, my dear Meriel, but have you no other friends, in who[s]e welfare you are interested be[s]ide tho[s]e you left in England." "Perhaps it is from Kingly?"---"You are right," [s]he replied, "and the contents are [s]o much le[s]s dreadful than your mind forboded, that I think I may commit it to your peru[s]al." "Poor Margaret is wor[s]e, I fear," [s]aid I, as I took the letter. She made me no answer, and I read it with a compo[s]ure at which I have [s]ince been a[s]toni[s]hed. I [s]end [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-510.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] you a copy, and believe me, Celia, every line as I retraced it, has been wet with my tears. Farewell, my dear girl, methinks you mu[s]t be weary of a corre[s]pondent who writes only on melancholy themes.---Ah! my Celia, the mi[s]erable know no luxury equal to that of dwelling on their [s]orrows, and weeping over their [s]ource. In this you have ever indulged me, and it is a privilege I [s]hall not ea[s]ily forego.---Adieu! God ble[s]s you. MERIEL. MR. KINGLY to MISS SIDNEY. [1] -  Calais Jan. 13 th , 1784.

Oh, Amelia! unle[s]s you could for a moment place your[s]elf in my [s]ituation, you can have no idea of my wretchedne[s]s. My wife! my friend! my lovely! and beloved! Margaret is no more. I have taken up my pen to inform you of her placid, her heavenly end:---but I feel I am unequal to the ta[s]k.---I mu[s]t pau[s]e.---My tears will flow.--- in [s]uch a cau[s]e the brave[s]t need not blu[s]h to indulge their [s]en[s]ibility. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-512.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] I am more compo[s]ed---I have gazed on the [s]erene countenance of my departed angel, and gathered fortitude from the remembrance of her virtues; from that ble[s][s]ed a[s][s]urance, that the [s]troke which pierces my heart has [s]ecured to her felicity which will never end. The di[s]order which alarmed us [s]o much, by its appearance, before Rook[s]by left Calais, terminated in an inflammation on the lungs and a putrid [s]ore throat occa[s]ioned by the cold the dear creature had taken and the agitation her [s]pirits had undergone. It made rapid advances. She knew her own danger, and [s]eemed re[s]igned to quit the world, only that her heart yearned for her children: but even when [s]he thought of them, her pious [s]oul extracted con[s]olation from the reliance [s]he placed on a divine guardian and protector to whom [s]he solemnly recommended them. Ju[s]t before the la[s]t awful [s]cene was clo[s]ed, [s]he called me to her bed [s]ide, "Kingly," [s]aid [s]he, "I am going.---Four years of superlative felicity is as much as humanity can expect. I am re[s]igned to my fate, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-513.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] humbly thank my bountiful Creator that I have not lived to know the privation of your affection. That, my dear Frederic, I fear would have been a trial to which my fortitude would have proved unequal. I need not recommend my children to your care. I am [s]atisfied you will never forget you are a father." I a[s][s]ured her of my con[s]tant attention and undeviating affection to tho[s]e dear pledges of our love, and begged [s]he would not too much exhau[s]t her[s]elf by talking. "I mu[s]t [s]peak, my love," [s]aid [s]he, "Alas! in a few hours that power will be denied me. I have [s]omething of importance to [s]ay. You have been vilely deceived. Mrs. Rooksby ever loved you.---She is truth and purity it[s]elf."--- She was proceeding, when a kind of convulsion [s]eized her---and [s]he recovered only to [s]peak in incoherent [s]entences---"Be the unalterable friend---She is worthy--- In my cabinet you will"---She endeavoured to fini[s]h the [s]entence, but in vain---her eyes clo[s]ed---her gentle [s]pirit [s]led forever!--- The angui[s]h of my heart is better imagined than de[s]cribed. Though I ever [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-514.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] endeavoured to promote the happine[s]s of my Margaret; yet, when I reflect that I did undoubtedly love another, and that however, by the mo[s]t grateful attention, I endeavoured to veil my feelings from her, yet [s]he knew the [s]ituation of my heart, and knew the worth of the object. I cannot but fear it hurt her [s]en[s]ibility and preyed upon her [s]pirits. I [s]hall immediately return to England to attend her remains to their la[s]t dreary mansion, [s]ettle my children, di[s]mi[s]s my [s]ervants and [s]olicit immediate employment; for idleness will only be the nur[s]e of affliction, and it is my duty to live and endeavour to recover my [s]pirits that I may attend to the dear beque[s]ts of my Margaret, be father! mother! every dear relation to her children, and the firm friend of---I need not write her name. I have [s]ometimes thought her capricious and incon[s]i[s]tent, but the words "you have been viley deceived," have awakened [s]entiments in my bo[s]om, which it is improper to indulge, tell her, my dear madam that while I live, I [s]hall con[s]ider my[s]elf as bound to [s]upport! honour! and protect her! Alas! what right have I to protect her? is [s]he not the wife of another?---Yes [s]he is,--- but that other is a villain, as [s]uch every man [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-515.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] of honour and [s]en[s]ibility has a right to [s]tep forward in her defence. "She is purity it[s]elf"---true but that purity cannot excel the pure the friendly affection that glows in my brea[s]t. A per[s]on who looks not beyond the [s]urface of things, may think that the[s]e expre[s][s]ions are an in[s]ult, a [s]ure mark of di[s]re[s]pect, to the memory of my departed Margaret, but you my dear madam will con[s]ider them as they are meant a proof of my con[s]idence in her veracity, a wi[s]h to fulfil her la[s]t de[s]ire. Meriel is the wife of Rook[s]by.---My [s]oul ever abhorred [s]eduction of any kind; but to [s]educe a wife! a mother! horror! infamy!---the wealth of Indus, the joys of paradi[s]e would not tempt me to [s]uch a mea[s]ure. No, Margaret no! my beloved partner. Meriel may be the adopted mother of your children, may implant in their minds tho[s]e virtues which have [s]upported her under all her afflictons, but for me, I will [s]eek employment abroad, and fly from trials, which might be too powerful for me. I have ju[s]t received Rook[s]by's letter informing me of the death of his mother, and your union with Captain On[s]low.

My dear Celia may perhaps be [s]urprized that we did not attend the remains of our revered mother to England: but the ob[s]tinacy of Rook[s]by was not to be overcome, and I was afraid to leave him le[s]t by my ab[s]ence I [s]hould appear to give a [s]anction to a connection which though I could not entirely prevent, I was determined as much as po[s][s]ible to interrupt. My friendly Amelia [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-517.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] and her hu[s]band were returning to England, and propo[s]ed [s]eeing the la[s]t duties fulfilled to my beloved parent, while I heavily and unwillingly attended Rook[s]by to Paris, where we were [s]oon joined by Clara and Belger, the former of whom has now thrown a[s]ide all re[s]traint, appearing publicly as the mistress of Rook[s]by. Her hou[s]e and establishment are elegant; [s]he gives [s]plendid entertainments, and though her infamy is well known, [s]he is courted, followed and caressed by the fa[s]hionable world; while I am left a poor [s]olitary creature, in the mid[s]t of a bu[s]y multitude, without friend or comforter. The parting with Amelia was like severing [s]oul and body. I felt as if in lo[s]ing her, I lo[s]t all [s]upport, for though I am sensible, that you, my dear Celia, compassionate all my [s]ufferings, yet [s]ecluded as you are from the world, you cannot participate the [s]orrows of which you have no idea.

She gives splendid balls, concerts compo[s]ed of the fir[s]t performers, and pretends to countenance all the literati of the age; be[s]ides [s]he is an amateur in painting, and it is almo[s]t incredible what [s]ums [s]he [s]quanders, in the[s]e pur[s]uits. My dear little girl has now been with me three weeks. Su[s]an Mo[s][s]op came over with her, Su[s]an is a lively girl and immediately attracted the notice of Belger. It gave me pain to [s]ee it, as I was too well acquainted with the principles of the man to think he meant an honourable attachment, and in a friendly manner warned her to beware. Would you believe it? my attention to her happine[s]s was con[s]trued into jealou[s]y, and from that moment [s]he has treated me with contempt and in[s]olence.

Oh heavens! how hard are my trials: when will the throbbings of my bo[s]om cea[s]e!

Say, [s]hould I never return, will you be their mother, their coun[s]ellor, their friend?

The friend[s]hip I bore their departed mother,[s]" "And is there nothing due to the affection with which you once honoured their unhappy father.

Yes my con[s]tant, my adored Meriel, I am now [s]atisfied, that you mu[s]t have thought me the ba[s]e[s]t of mankind, as I at one time believed you the mo[s]t capricious of women: but I can ea[s]ily trace the black mi[s]chief to the fountain head.

He caught my hands, while I in vain endeavoured to [s]uppre[s]s my tears; but unable to command my voice [s]ufficiently to an[s]wer him, I continued [s]ilent and he proceeded. "My own di[s]appointment, my own sufferings I have learned to bear without complaining; but your's, dear Meriel, torture me beyond imagination. I [s]ee you married to a man, who ungratefully throws from him a gem, which might add [s]plendor to a diadem. I [s]ee you unhappy; and feel I have not the power to alleviate your [s]orrows.

[s]aid I, "your life is too precious to be lightly thrown away. Consider your children---for their [s]ake, for the [s]ake of your friends, pre[s]erve it." "And may I rank Mrs. Rook[s]by among tho[s]e friends, who are intere[s]ted in my safety?" "Do you doubt it Kingly? who is there on earth [s]o dear?"---I pau[s]ed---I recollected I was a wife---I was a mother!--- The glow of [s]elf-reproach, crim[s]oned my face.

I felt, that [s]pite of all re[s]i[s]tance, I [s]till loved him, and was [s]till ardently beloved---but at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-524.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] the [s]ame moment, I remembered I could never be his.--- "Believe me," [s]aid I, "my heart has never wandered." "Ten thou[s]and thanks!" cried he, wildly ki[s][s]ing my hands. At that moment the door opened and Rook[s]by entered. To describe the [s]cene that en[s]ued would be impossible. I felt I had been to blame---I dared not a[s][s]ert my innocence, though I had forgotten my[s]elf but for a moment.---"Detested villian," [s]aid he," darting a fierce look at Kingly; "and you prevaricating wretch, where now is your boa[s]ted virtue?"---He at the [s]ame time [s]eized me rudely by the arm: Kingly interpo[s]ed[s]"Dare not to treat your wife injuriou[s]ly---[s]he is an angel."

"Rook[s]by," [s]aid Kingly, with an air of dignity, "you are the hu[s]band of Meriel Howard. I believe you do not doubt my courage: but worlds [s]hould not tempt me to lift my hand again[s]t your life." "Ba[s]e [s]ubterfuge---cowardly villain!"--- cried the enraged Rook[s]by, and [s]truck him.

Sen[s]e for[s]ook me and when I recovered, I found they had left the hou[s]e together. I am dreadfully agitated: Six hours have I pa[s]t in the mo[s]t agonizing suspence; during which time, I have at intervals endeavoured to compo[s]e my perturbed [s]pirits by writing:---But, alas! I can no longer proceed. Intere[s]ted in the fate of both, [s]hould they fight, I am de[s]tined to be unhappy. Rook[s]by is returned---Kingly is dangerously wounded, and in a few hours my husband [s]ets off for Italy. I return to England with my child; but Su[s]an Mo[s][s]op for[s]akes me in my di[s]tre[s]s and goes to Clara, where ruin and infamy, I fear, will [s]oon overtake her. I [s]hall write no more on this [s]ide the channel. Heaven grant that Kingly may recover, and Rook[s]by awaken to a [s]en[s]e of his errors.

A variety of incidents have contributed to make me appear neglectful of my friend; but they are now all pa[s]t, and I am [s]ettled in a little neat retreat far from the bu[s]y [s]cenes of life, where my chief occupation is the care of my [s]weet girl. I think my Celia, after buffeting as I have done the wayes of adver[s]ity, the calm [s]erenity of my little dwelling diffu[s]es a degree of comfort over my heart, to which it has long been a [s]tranger. On my arrival in England, I went immediately to our hou[s]e in Harley-Street, where [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-527.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] I [s]pent a week in the mo[s]t torturing [s]u[s]pence expecting every day to hear of Kingly's death, as I had de[s]ired a gentleman in Paris to inform me of that event immediately, if it [s]hould happen, or in ca[s]e of his recovery, to let me know when he was out of danger. My dear Amelia came to me the day after my arrival and every tender attention, which friend[s]hip could be[s]tow, I experienced from her and Captain On[s]low. At length the long expected letter arrived and I read, to my [s]urprize and joy, that Kingly was in a fair way of recovery. This was an infinite relief to my mind, and I began to regain [s]ome degree of compo[s]ure, which was only interrupted by the idea of parting with my friend Mrs. On[s]low, who was on the point of accompanying her hu[s]band to India; but the privation of her [s]ociety was an event I was prepared to expect from the day of her marriage; I lamented it in [s]ilence, and only congratulated the dear woman on the felicitous pro[s]pects that [s]eemed to await her, without damping her [s]pirits by a mention of my [s]orrows of which her departure from England was not the lea[s]t. She had not been gone above a month, when I was alarmed and terrified by an execution coming into the hou[s]e, and on enquiring into my hu[s]band's affairs, learned [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-528.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] that his folly and Clara's profligacy had involved him in irretrievable embarra[s][s]ments; that he had mortgaged or [s]old almo[s]t all his property and could not command a thou[s]and pounds clear in the world, except the e[s]tates which had been [s]ettled on me at my marriage and the [s]mall one in Glamorgan[s]hire, which he had pre[s]ented to me previous to our union. I con[s]ulted with Mr. le Sage, a particular friend of Rook[s]by's whether any thing could be done to relieve him, and offered to cancel my marriage [s]ettlement; but of this he would not hear. However I determined to retrench every [s]uperfluous expen[s]e in my house-keeping, to di[s]charge my [s]ervants and lay down my carriage. Having made this re[s]olution, I in[s]tantly [s]et about the execution of it, called in all my accounts and paid to the utmo[s]t of my power every thing due, I then told Mr. le Sage that I [s]hould leave London and did not wi[s]h my place of re[s]idence to be known to many of my acquaintance; but that I [s]hould e[s]teem it a favour if he would inform me, whenever he heard of Rook[s]by, and forward to me any letters that might come from the continent. I then with only two [s]ervants [s]et forward for Glamorgan[s]hire. I found the journey very fatiguing e[s]pecially when I drew near its conclu[s]ion. My income was now very confined yet I thought two hundred a year would be a [s]ufficient [s]upport [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-529.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] for my[s]elf and child with economy, and would be a certain refuge for her, whenever I [s]hould be no more. As to my marriage [s]ettlement I did not con[s]ider it as my own, but held it merely with a view of being serviceable to my hu[s]band in any future emergency. Do not think, my dear Celia, I mean to in[s]inuate that affection for Rook[s]by led me to act thus. No, that had long been extinct, gratitude had at one time awakened in my bo[s]om an affection pure and tender, if not ardent, but his conduct [s]ince has entirely extingui[s]hed it, and whatever I do now proceeds from a motive of duty, and a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of right. He is the father of my child. He is the man I have solemnly promi[s]ed to prefer to all his [s]ex. Oh! Celia! what an awful [s]tate is marriage and yet how thoughtle[s]sly do many ru[s]h into it. How ought we to reflect before we take a promi[s]e it may not be in our power to keep. While I live I hope my actions will ever be the re[s]ult of principle, and that principle rectitude. Let me perform my duty chearfully, and leave the event to heaven. But I am wandering. When I drew near the hou[s]e which [s]tands on my little farm, I was shocked to [s]ee how very de[s]olate it appeared, it had been untenanted two years and only a young man and his mother lived in one part of it; the one looked after the farm; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-530.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] and the other milked the cows, made the butter and [s]ent it to market. Part of the garden was cultivated but the large[s]t half was over-run with weeds. Rook[s]by had not [s]een it for [s]even years pa[s]t, and in that time it had been [s]adly neglected, [s]o that though its original value had been two hundred pounds per year, it did not now produce half that [s]um. A cold chillne[s]s [s]ezied my [s]pirits as we drove up to the gate; the woman had been taught to expect me for I wrote to the young man, that a couple of bed-rooms might be prepared and well aired; the coach [s]topped, the door was opened and from the hou[s]e come---judge who, my dear Celia. Why no other than my dear old nur[s]e, Deborah Ellis. I do really believe, I [s]creamed with joy when I [s]aw her. She, poor old [s]oul, had no remembrance of me; but [s]tood curtsying, and fearing my lady[s]hip was very much fatigued. I followed her into the hou[s]e---a [s]mall parlour wore the appearance of comfort; a table was covered with a clean coar[s]e cloth, and in a few moments Deborah brought in a couple of boiled chickens, a bottle of current wine, and every other appurtenance for dinner. I could not now withhold from di[s]covering my[s]elf: but stopping her as [s]he was about to leave the room, "Deborah," [s]aid I," have you forgot me Deborah." A [s]ilent look of enquiry and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-531.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] [s]urprize was her only reply. "Surely," [s]aid I, "you mu[s]t remember your poor little Meriel.---"Meriel madam! what my dear Mi[s]s Meriel Howard?"---"Yes Deborah, your own Meriel, pray [s]peak to me, I am Meriel Howard."---She laid her hand on my arm and looking earne[s]tly in my face the large drops of joy cha[s]ed each other down her aged countenance.--- "I think you are like her," [s]aid [s]he, "but you are altered, you did not u[s]ed to be [s]o thin nor [s]o pale." Then cla[s]ping me in her arms [s]he continued, "I know you now, for well I remember you was the child of affliction.--- I then told her in as conci[s]e a manner as po[s][s]ible every occurrence that had pa[s][s]ed [s]ince my removal to London, [s]till carefully concealing every thing that might lead to the [s]ubject of my leaving [s]o abruptly Woodbine cott, and the unhappy con[s]equences that preceded it. But I can plainly di[s]cover [s]he too well gue[s][s]es the cau[s]e of that elopement.--- She comforted and con[s]oled me under my pre[s]ent circum[s]tances, and declared [s]he would never again be [s]eperated from me. I learnt from her, that the mother of the young man who managed the farm, was her [s]i[s]ter, that [s]he was lately dead, and that [s]he herself had come by her nephew's de[s]ire to get [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-532.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] the rooms ready for his lady's coming; but [s]he had, no thought of finding in that lady the dear little girl, whom [s]he had nur[s]ed, and loved like a child of her own. You will readily imagine, my dear Celia, that the pre[s]ence of Deborah greatly contributed to my comfort. I [s]oon got [s]ettled, di[s]charged my man [s]ervant, whom I had only engaged to accompany me on my journey, and with Deborah and Lucy, a young woman whom I had engaged to wait on my[s]elf and attend Clementina, I entered on an entire new way of life; and believe me, when I [s]ay, it is by far the mo[s]t comfortable I have experienced for many years. Colin, Deborah's nephew, [s]uperintends the farm, which I flatter my[s]elf, will [s]oon be in a flouri[s]hing [s]tate. My old fa[s]hioned ca[s]ements are overun with je[s]mine and honey-[s]uckle, and before my door, are a variety of ro[s]es, pinks, [s]weet-williams, and other flowers, which, though common are not le[s]s [s]weet, than the rare and expen[s]ive exotics that flouri[s]h in the green-hou[s]es of the fir[s]t noblemen in England. My parlour and dining room are ormamented with pots of myrtle, geranium, mignionet, and balm of giliad; the furniture con[s]i[s]ting only of plain oak tables and neat matted chairs. My bed chamber and that of my child, is furni[s]hed with white dimity, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-533.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] but made as plain as po[s][s]ible. Before I left London, I went to [s]ee Kingly's two children. They are in perfect health, and placed where I think they will meet with every tenderne[s]s and attention. I engaged the lady under who[s]e care they are placed, to write frequently and inform me of their welfare; for [s]hould illne[s]s attack them, I [s]hould not he[s]itate a moment to fly to their assistance. The world might perhaps, blame me, yet [s]urely, my Celia, the world mu[s]t be more unfeeling than I have even yet found it, [s]hould the conduct of a woman incur its cen[s]ure, who having a child of her own, loves and compa[s][s]ionates tho[s]e who are deprived of a mother's tenderne[s]s. In this retreat then, my friend, I hope to pa[s]s [s]ome few years in tranquillity. Even if Rook[s]by returns to England, he will be accompanied by Clara and I [s]hould be only thought a trouble[s]ome intruder; therefore, unle[s]s he requires it, I will not leave my retirement. Could I be of any [s]ervice to ward off any impending misfortune, or comfort him under affliction; [s]hould a declining [s]tate of health require the kind attention of a nur[s]e, then will I fly on the wings of duty, and prove my[s]elf a wife and friend. But alas! I fear he may perhaps even quit the world without my either [s]eeing him or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-534.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] knowing where he is; for he has not wrote to me [s]ince we parted at Paris, and knowing as I do his impetuous temper, I am [s]en[s]ible, e[s]pecially connected as he is with [s]uch a woman as Clara, he may be drawn into dangerous quarrels. But I grow tedious on this [s]ubject, which is ever uppermo[s]t in my thoughts, and cruel as he has behaved to me, I daily offer up a prayer for his [s]afety. Nay, [s]ometimes I fear, lea[s]t I have not loved him as I ought. Perhaps love [s]o ardent as his, was quick [s]ighted and could di[s]cover the difference between pa[s][s]ion and friendship: yet, from the fir[s]t of our acquaintance, I never attempted to deceive him or feign a tenderne[s]s I could not feel. Clara, I am certain has been the chief and only cau[s]e of alienating his affection from me.--- I remember when I fir[s]t knew her as Mrs. Moreton at Ken[s]ington, I told her in the unsuspected openne[s]s of my heart every circumstance of my my life, my [s]incere attachment to Rainsforth, my misfortunes, my ra[s]h and imprudent [s]tep to relieve my mother. The[s]e, perhaps, with aggravated circum[s]tances have been repeated to Rook[s]by, and he has imputed my union with him to intere[s]ted motives. Nay, he might even think the reluctance I [s]hewed to it at fir[s]t was the effect of art.--- The[s]e reflections often lead me to think more favourably of his conduct than perhaps [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-535.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] others will [s]ay it de[s]erves. While I ever behaved to him in one uniform manner, tender, attentive, but calm and [s]erene. Clara has no doubt affected the mo[s]t impetuous pa[s][s]ion and by this means has gained that a[s]cendency over him which I greatly fear will end but in his total ruin or death. Augu[s]t 29 th . I have ju[s]t received a letter from Kingly. He is going on a three years [s]tation to America. May the God of Battles defend him. He had heard of Rook[s]by's misfortunes and [s]ent me a letter of credit on his banker; but of this no nece[s][s]ity whatever, [s]hould tempt me to avail my[s]elf. No, Celia, I feel my heart too much oppre[s][s]ed already with the weight of obligation. I am already but too apt to make compari[s]ons of what is, and what might have been my fate, and this [s]hall be the la[s]t time I will indulge my[s]elf in writing of him to you. Speak of him, I cannot, as no per[s]on here knows him; and I will endeavour not to think of him, for when I remember that there is [s]uch a man, I mu[s]t al[s]o remember that it was he fir[s]t taught my heart affection, it was he who [s]aved my life almo[s]t at the expen[s]e of his own, and that po[s][s]e[s][s]ed as he is of every [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-536.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] amiable quality, he is unhappy.---Oh! human nature, how weak thou art!--- Poor un[s]table beings that we are, con[s]cious of our errors, we [s]uffer rea[s]on to take the reins for a moment, and renounce them!

MERIEL. [2] Does not appear. Between this letter and the next there are [s]everal omitted, which Mrs. Rook[s]by wrote to her friend during her re[s]idence in the country, where [s]he continued four years, unnoticed by her hu[s]band and forgotten by a world, where her virtues had never been e[s]teemed as they de[s]erved. As the[s]e letters contain nothing material it was not judged nece[s][s]ary to print them. Mr. Rook[s]by's return to England called her again into the bu[s]y [s]cenes of life, and as her di[s]tre[s][s]ing [s]ituations are mo[s]t feelingly de[s]cribed by her own pathetic pen---we here again take up the corre[s]pondence. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London Dec. 13 th , 1788.

The [s]ea is deceitful and the inexperienced [s]ailor may be lo[s]t e'r he is aware of danger. This has been my ca[s]e. Lulled into [s]ecurity by the calm I had been allowed to enjoy I fondly flattered my[s]elf that I [s]hould [s]ink quietly into oblivion, forgetting and forgotten by the world. The accounts I heard of my hu[s]band were vague and improbable. I was at a lo[s]t to think how he [s]ub[s]i[s]ted. I was told he had [s]unk into the dete[s]ted character of a [s]harper and gambler. He never wrote to me, never enquired for me; nay, I was once informed that he had [s]pread a report of my death. A few days [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-539.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] after my la[s]t to you as I was in[s]tructing my little darling in the fir[s]t rudiment of the English language, a letter was brought me which I enclo[s]e for your peru[s]al. MADAM, IT is with infinite regret I take up my pen to inform you of what I am [s]en[s]ible will give you the mo[s]t lively affliction and disturb that tranquillity, which through the exertions of your own good [s]en[s]e you have for [s]ome time enjoyed. Mr. Rook[s]by is in England. He arrived at my hou[s]e la[s]t night, extremely ill both in body and mind; he informed me in a few almo[s]t incoherent words, that he had killed a man at Bru[s][s]els, where he has re[s]ided for [s]ome time, that in the fray he met with a [s]light wound in his [s]houlder, which had never been properly dre[s][s]ed, as his [s]ervant had hurried him to England with the utmo[s]t rapidity, and that he him[s]elf was unwilling to [s]top after cro[s][s]ing the channel till he arrived in London. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-540.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] I found he was very much fatigued, and from the agitation of his [s]pirits and anguish of the wound, very feveri[s]h. We per[s]uaded him to go to bed and [s]ent for a [s]urgeon, who examined the wound and pronounced it [s]light; but in a bad way from being neglected. He was very re[s]tle[s]s all night, and towards morning I thought rather wild in his di[s]cour[s]e, I a[s]ked him if I [s]hould [s]end for you,---"[s]end for who" [s]aid he, rai[s]ing him[s]elf ha[s]tily, for "Mrs. Rook[s]by? for which of them," [s]aid he, wildly "I have two wives."---I thought this was a certain indication of delirium and forbore to answer him, but he caught hold of my hand and obliging me to [s]it down thus continued, "if you mean Meriel, I have injured her too much to expect [s]he will come, and as to Harriet, or Clara---Oh! do not tell Clara where I am!"---He then appeared violently agitated and [s]oon after raved in a very incoherent manner. I thought, madam, it was nece[s][s]ary you [s]hould be informed of his unhappy [s]ituation, and therefore [s]end an expre[s]s off with this immediately, reque[s]ting you will [s]et off for town as quick as po[s][s]ible; your pre[s]ence may in [s]ome mea[s]ure calm his perturbed [s]pirits, and be the means of a recovery, which I believe the Phy[s]ician considers at pre[s]ent very doubtful. Fearing you might not be accommodated with ca[s]h [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-541.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] for [s]o long a journey, I have taken the liberty of inclo[s]ing a fifty pound note, which you can repay at your own convenience. I am Madam, with great re[s]pect, your humble [s]ervant, EDWARD LE SAGE. -  Welbeck Street Sept. 9 th , 1788. YOU will readily believe, that when the [s]hock my [s]pirits had received was a little [s]ub[s]ided, I [s]at about ha[s]ty preparations for my journey: I took Lucy with me and left Clementina in the care of Deborah. I made but [s]hort [s]toppages on the road, taking but little refre[s]hment, and no re[s]t till I arrived in town. Anxiety kept me up, nor was I [s]en[s]ible of the fatigue I had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-542.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] undergone:---But when I alighted in Welbeck Street, and attempted to walk up [s]tairs, I found the exertion was beyond my [s]trength, and I [s]unk almo[s]t in[s]en[s]ible on the landing place. Mr. Le Sage was very attentive and friendly, as was al[s]o his amiable daughter; and by their kindne[s]s I [s]oon found my[s]elf able to enquire after poor Rook[s]by. They told me he was better, that he knew I was expected, and, that he was impatient to [s]ee me. I rellied my [s]pirits, and having at the reque[s]t of my kind ho[s]t taken a gla[s]s of wine, I proceeded to the [s]ick chamber. I approached the bed cautiou[s]ly.---Good Heavens!---what havoc has intemperance and [s]ickne[s]s made in his per[s]on? How little [s]hould I have known him for the blooming elegant Clement Rook[s]by, whom only [s]even years before I had accepted as my hu[s]band. Pale, emaciated, and haggard was his countenance; his words [s]o weak they could not be understood. He fixed his eyes for an in[s]tant on me; his lips moved, he [s]tretched one hand out toward me and with the other covered his face. I took the offered hand; compassion overpowered re[s]entment; I rai[s]ed it to my lips and wet it with my tears. "Oh! thou dear generous woman," [s]aid he faintly, "I have not de[s]erved this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-543.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] tenderness---I am a wretch, unworthy of your notice: but you are an angel of mercy come to whi[s]per pardon to my [s]oul that I may die in peace." "You will live many years yet," [s]aid I, "many years in comfort and health." "Never," [s]aid he, eagerly, "I do not wi[s]h to live. Health may return: but my heart will never know peace nor joy again; therefore. 'twere well, if it were cold and motionle[s]s. But, oh! my beloved---I do not de[s]erve to live and I am afraid to die!" Here the nur[s]e interpo[s]ed, and I was forced to leave him; for while I [s]tayed, he per[s]i[s]ted in talking to me, which irritated the di[s]order. I had not left him long, when he [s]ent to know if I had brought Clementina with me; and [s]eemed greatly disappointed when he found I had not. His anxiety to [s]ee the child, plea[s]ed me, and tempted me to write to Deborah to come with her to town immediately. The tender a[s][s]iduity, which inclination prompted me to [s]how my poor Rook[s]by, accelerated his recovery and in about [s]ix weeks I had the plea[s]ure of seeing him able to bear a removal to a [s]mall hou[s]e we had taken at Pimlico. I had carefully avoided [s]uffering him to dwell on pa[s]t di[s]agreeable circum[s]tances and endeavoured [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-544.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] by every means I could devi[s]e, to direct the melancholy I [s]aw daily increa[s]ing; but my attempts were vain, and indeed had I known the real [s]ource of that melancholy, my own heart would have been equally oppre[s][s]ed. We had been in our new habitation, but a fortnight, when one morning as we were at breakfa[s]t; two men entered and arre[s]ted Rook[s]by for a debt of five thou[s]and pounds. which he told me was a gaming debt, and the [s]ame which had involved him in the unlucky quarrel at Bru[s][s]els as he [s]u[s]pected the per[s]on who won it of him, did not win it fairly. I cannot tell you what I felt. Weak and low as he was, it was death to [s]ee him conveyed to a pri[s]on, yet that I knew mu[s]t be the inevitable con[s]equence of the arre[s]t, as I had no means to extricate him from that and [s]everal others of a [s]imilar nature, for which he had been draw in to give his note. With a heart almo[s]t breaking I [s]aw him depart, and then immediately [s]ent for a lawyer, whom I determined to inve[s]t with power to [s]ell the little property we po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, I did not con[s]ult Mr. Le Sage. I knew his cold Philosophy would [s]trongly oppo[s]e my giving up my [s]ettlements. Yet [s]ure, my dear Celia, I [s]hould have been wrong to he[s]itate a moment, or out of a pretended care for the future welfare of my child to [s]uffer her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-545.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] father oppre[s][s]ed with [s]ickne[s]s and tortured by remor[s]e, for[s]aken by tho[s]e gay triflers, who once called them[s]elves his friends, to wa[s]te the remainder of his wretched life in a pri[s]on. "When I had given every proper direction for the rai[s]ing what money we could, and endeavouring to bring the unju[s]t holders of his notes to [s]ome compo[s]ition, I vi[s]ited him in his [s]ad abode and endeavoured to chear and comfort him. That duty fulfilled, I returned to my [s]olitary home and taking my dear girl on my lap gave a free vent to tears which flowed from real angui[s]h of heart. Deborah brought in my tea. She [s]hut the windows, [s]tirred the fire and twice attempted to [s]peak; but the hone[s]t creature's own feelings were too acute to permit her to comfort me. My poor Clementina, from [s]ympathy had laid her dear head on my bo[s]om and mixed her tears with mine "Mamma is [s]ick, Deborah," [s]aid [s]he. Deborah took her [s]ilently from me, wiped off the tears that trickled down her innocent face; once more attempted to [s]peak, but unable to articulate turned ha[s]tily from me and wept aloud. How long [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-546.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] this [s]cene of mute [s]orrow would have continued I know not; but we were arou[s]ed from it by a coach [s]topping and a loud rap at the door. I trembled, I knew not why; I wi[s]hed not to [s]ee any vi[s]itors, yet had not pre[s]ence of mind to forbid any one being admitted, and before I could compo[s]e my countenance or wipe away the traces of sorrow from my face the door opened and a mo[s]t lovely young woman entered. Her dre[s]s was [s]econd mourning, neat in the extreme, and [s]he was vi[s]ibly pregnant. Her looks were characteri[s]tic of mode[s]ty and truth. Her manners at once attractive and commanding, [s]uch as [s]he appeared to me at that moment, fancy now repre[s]ents her to my mind, and I find, [s]orrowful as my heart is, it has yet a vulnerable part that feels for her afflictions. She curt[s]yed and with a look and voice humility entreated pardon for the intru[s]ion, [s]he had hoped to have found Mr. Rook[s]by at home. "He will not be at home to-night madam," [s]aid I, as I entreated her to be [s]eated, "but if you will favour me with your commands I will [s]erve you to the utmo[s]t of my power." "Pardon me, madam," [s]aid [s]he, "commands are not for the unfortunate, I came [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-547.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] not to command but entreat.---To entreat Mr Rook[s]by will call to his rememberance an unhappy woman, who deprived of his frien[s]hip mu[s]t be forever lo[s]t." "If you mean Mrs. Millar, madam," [s]aid I with [s]ome [s]urprize. "I am a[s]toni[s]hed [s]he could employ [s]o re[s]pectable a per[s]on on [s]o very improper a me[s][s]age." "Alas! madam I do not know Mrs. Millar, I have indeed heard of her and that [s]he had u[s]ed Mr. Rook[s]by extremely ill, but it is not for her I would plead, it is for my[s]elf." "Your[s]elf," cried I, in breathle[s]s agitation. "Does he owe you money." "Oh no! no! he owes me [s]uccour and [s]upport, I am his wife! and he has for[s]aken me." I believe the wildne[s]s of my looks terrified her; for [s]he caught hold of my hand and thus proceeded.---"Dear madam, do not be angry, you perhaps are his [s]i[s]ter, you blame the unequal alliance. I was poor, madam; but indeed, I will never di[s]grace the name he has honoured me with." She might have proceeded longer without interruption. A [s]udden [s]tupefaction [s]eemed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-548.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] to deprive me of [s]en[s]e or feeling. This agravation of my calamities was more than I could bear, and nature [s]unk under the [s]hock. She was alarmed and ha[s]tily rung the bell. The entrance of Deborah and the child awakened me to [s]en[s]ibility, and the tears which the dreadful di[s]covery I had ju[s]t made had suspended, now gu[s]hed forth afre[s]h. I gave them free vent, and thanked heaven for the relief they gave my heart. When I became a little compo[s]ed, I reflected on the [s]ad intelligence I had to communicate to my unfortunate gue[s]t. At one moment I re[s]olved in compa[s][s]ion to her [s]ituation to hide the truth from her; yet on reflection that appeared impo[s][s]ible. My next care was how to break it to her in the tendere[s]t manner; I invited her to partake my repa[s]t, and soothed her by the kinde[s]t attention; yet by degrees hinted to her that all was not as it [s]hould be, that I feared her expectations would be greatly di[s]appointed, that Rook[s]by was in trouble, and I would advi[s]e her at that time not to attempt to [s]ee him. "But if he is in affliction, madam, is it not my duty to fly to him, though he has for[s]aken me."---"I fear, my dear, you would meet a [s]hock, [s]hould you attempt to [s]ee him. He at pre[s]ent could not with propriety receive you."---"Could not,--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-549.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] perhaps you think he would not?"---"I do not mean [s]o. I never heard him mention you; but I know there are very forcible rea[s]ons again[s]t his receiving you; rea[s]ons which make it altogether impo[s][s]ible for you to be with him.---Yet do not be alarmed though Mr. Rook[s]by cannot I will be your friend. It [s]eemed as at one moment [s]he had comprehended the extent of her misfortune, for [s]tarting ha[s]tily from her [s]eat [s]he cried "Oh! I [s]ee it all, you, you madam, are not his [s]i[s]ter, you are his wife, and I am undone forever!" To give a proper force to the [s]cene during the re[s]t of the evening would be impo[s][s]ible. I detained her with me and in the language of the pure[s]t [s]implicity, [s]he told a tale that for a moment [s]tole me from my own [s]orrow, to lament hers. I have reque[s]ted her to commit it to writing that I might tran[s]mit it to you. She has complied and bid me tell you if [s]he can [s]ave enough from the wreck of her little fortune to pay her entrance [s]he will come and in your convent bury her [s]hame and her misfortunes. Oh! my Celia, [s]hould [s]he come, receive her with the kindness of a [s]i[s]ter, and [s]trive to alleviate the [s]orrows of her heart. She is innocent, unsuspecting, and full of [s]en[s]ibility.

P. S. I will continue my melancholy tale the next packet. At pre[s]ent neither my [s]trength or [s]pirits are equal to the ta[s]k of writing more; be[s]ides my adored Clementina is far from well, and I have al[s]o with me Clara's two boys who, neglected at the [s]chool where they were left, had been very ill treated.--- I have but little for my[s]elf, but while that little la[s]ts, the grand-children of my revered Mrs. Rook[s]by, the relations of the [s]ainted Margaret Kingly, [s]hall [s]hare with my own child the mor[s]el kind heaven be[s]tows.

When I went to vi[s]it my dear boys, I enquired when they had [s]een Mrs. Rook[s]by. They told me that for [s]ome time pa[s]t they had neither [s]een or heard from her. I then repaired to Le Sage, who I knew was Rooksby's banker. From him I learned that Rook[s]by was in pri[s]on, and the dear worthy Meriel in di[s]tre[s]s for even the common nece[s][s]aries of life. Her child, her beloved Clementina had been ill with the mea[s]les, and was even then in the utmo[s]t danger from a di[s]order which had [s]ettled on her lungs. I ha[s]tened to [s]eek her out, and found her, On[s]low, in a [s]mall lodging up three pair of [s]tairs, in the vicinity of the King's bench pri[s]on, where her unworthy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-555.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] hu[s]band was confined. When I entered the room, [s]he was kneeling by the bed-[s]ide, her face, her hands, elevated towards that Heaven who[s]e mercy [s]he [s]upplicated in behalf of her dying child. Be[s]ide her knelt two lovely intere[s]ting boys, whom I afterwards learned were the children Rook[s]by had by Clara. I [s]poke to her. She took but little notice of me, for the feelings of a mother had ab[s]orbed every other. She [s]igned for me to [s]it down, and pointing to her daughter looked unutterable angui[s]h. I enquired whether [s]he had proper advice and assistance; her an[s]wer cut me to the heart. She had not the means to procure proper medical advice!---Every thing of value had been di[s]po[s]ed of to [s]upport her husband.--- I did not remain long with this dear [s]uffering angel!---But [s]ent a Physician and a nur[s]e to her, telling the latter, I would defray every expence---for will you believe it, On[s]low, the dear creature, though reduced to the utmo[s]t di[s]tre[s]s, had never availed her[s]elf of the letter of credit I [s]ent her previous to my departure from England. On the third day after this arrangement, I called to enquire how [s]he was and found her [s]weet little girl had ju[s]t breathed her la[s]t. That was not a time to offer con[s]olation. I took the two boys from her, and gave orders for the funeral.

I thought my company at that time might be more intru[s]ive than welcome; be[s]ides I was [s]en[s]ible the world was ever ready to cen[s]ure an unhappy woman, who in distress met with friend[s]hip, however disinterested from our [s]ex. I therefore determined to wait till the funeral was over, before I attempted to [s]ee my dear afflicted Meriel; but on the very evening that the child was buried, I received a me[s][s]age from Deborah, [s]aying her mi[s]tre[s]s was extremely ill, and [s]he wi[s]hed I would come to her immediately. I had been told that my adored girl had once before from the effect of a very heavy affliction, lo[s]t her [s]en[s]es for [s]ome days---(though what that affliction was, I never learned.)---But from this intelligence, I was prepared to find the [s]ame misfortune had befallen her. I was not deceived. She was writing when I entered the room, to a Mi[s]s Shelburne, with whom [s]he [s]pent the early part of her life in a convent at Bologne, [s]uch a letter, On[s]low, as would melt the mo[s]t obdurate heart. I waited till [s]he voluntarily re[s]igned her pen, which [s]he [s]oon did, when folding her letter and speaking to me, as though I was her [s]ervant [s]he hade me make ha[s]te with it to the Po[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-557.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] or I [s]hould be too late. It was by [s]tratagem I got her to accompany me home, where I provided medical and other a[s][s]i[s]tance. Deborah has faithfully attended her, and I am told [s]he is now in a fair way of recovery, though her [s]en[s]es are [s]till wandering.--- During her confinement I have taken care that Rook[s]by [s]hould want for nothing; because I believe it is the fir[s]t wi[s]h of the dear creature's heart. But I cannot bring my[s]elf to [s]ee or conver[s]e with a man, who has reduced [s]o noble a mind as Meriel Howard's to in[s]anity; for [s]ure I am, her mental faculties mu[s]t have been greatly weakened by prior afflictions or [s]he would not [s]o powerfully have felt the lo[s]s of her child. Her pious [s]oul, if in the unimpaired u[s]e of her rea[s]on, would have [s]everely felt the privation but [s]till [s]ubmitted with patience.--- Deborah [s]ends for me. May it be good tidings from her, who is all in all to me, and who though the wife of another, po[s][s]e[s][s]es my tendere[s]t affection. Blame me not, my right was prior to his, and believe me my affection is pure as the [s]oul of her who inspires it. She is re[s]tored to rea[s]on, thanks be to heaven for it, I have not yet [s]een her, nor does [s]he know in who[s]e hou[s]e [s]he is; but I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-558.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] am all joy at the fair pro[s]pect of her returning health. Tell your lovely amiable wife that every exertion nece[s][s]ary for the restoration of her friend [s]hall be u[s]ed, and that I hope my next letter will inform you of her perfect recovery. God ble[s]s you. May I [s]ee my dear Meriel in health before I am ordered again to leave England and I [s]hall go without regret. Adieu, Yours in friend[s]hip, F. KINGLY. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London March 16 th , 1789.

Why am I doomed to be thus obliged, where I have no power to return the obligation but by grateful prayers and tears; I have [s]ome faint recollection of having wrote you a letter after the death of my beloved Clementina; but I fear it was very incoherent and hardly intelligible; but I will now endeavour to go back to the period when the poor young creature whom my hu[s]band had [s]o vilely deceived came to my hou[s]e at Pimlico. I re[s]olved to prevent her, if po[s][s]ible, from [s]eeing Rook[s]by, as I knew it would only irritate his [s]ufferings, without in the lea[s]t alleviating her own; I therefore prevailed on her to remain with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-560.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] me till I could form [s]ome plan that might be of u[s]e to her; and as I every day expected Kingly in England, I thought he might render him[s]elf of [s]ervice to her, without [s]ubjecting her to the unju[s]t cen[s]ures, which would be ca[s]t on me [s]hould I accept favours from his hands. My time pa[s][s]ed wretched enough for three weeks. At the end of that time I perceived that Harriet, which was the name of my Proteg ee appeared [s]omewhat more chearful and on enquiring the cau[s]e, [s]he informed me that [s]he was certain [s]he had [s]een her mother's brother pa[s]s our hou[s]e frequently, that [s]he had inquired his name and learned it was the [s]ame [s]he had thought it to be, that he lived in the neighbourhood and was a wealthy widower without children. From this information Harriet had conceived the idea of writing to him and faithfully explaining her unhappy circum[s]tances. She [s]hewed me the copy of a letter [s]he had prepared, which as it contained the chief events of her life, I reque[s]ted leave to [s]end to you. I inclo[s]e it, and as it is nece[s][s]ary you [s]hould read it before I proceed I [s]hall here break off. [INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.] HARRIET VENABLES TO GEORGE PREVOTT, ESQ. December 24 th , 1788. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-561.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] Perhaps , my dear and honoured uncle will be both [s]urprized and offended to receive a letter from one whom no doubt he has heard, conducted her[s]elf in a manner that has thrown an odium on her family, I have been to blame, greatly to blame, but not [s]o very culpable as you and perhaps all the world imagine. I am fully [s]en[s]ible of the many disadvantages I labour under, while addre[s][s]ing you, yet when I remember that out of a numerous family you were the only one, who [s]hewed a friend[s]hip for my poor mother when her union with my father [s]o highly offended all. When I recollect the many in[s]tances of your affection I have my[s]elf witne[s][s]ed when I was but a child, I cannot but hope you will not turn away from the daughter of that once loved [s]i[s]ter.---Oh! why was I [s]o early [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-562.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] deprived of her maternal affection, or why did not the [s]ame [s]troke that [s]natched her from the world take al[s]o her unhappy daughter; for [s]urely of all the forlorn beings the world contains a girl deprived of her mother is the mo[s]t pitiable. She may, it is true, meet with relations or friends that will in [s]ome mea[s]ure [s]upply her place, but alas! they will not have the watchful care, the fond [s]olicitude of a mother. Had I never lo[s]t that dear parent I [s]hould not have been the unfortunate creature I am; for there is a fort of tali[s]manic virtue in the very name of mother, that while it fills our hearts with sensations unde[s]cribably delightful, is tempered with [s]uch awe, [s]uch fear of giving pain or incurring di[s]plea[s]ure, that it mu[s]t be a very insensible daughter who would wilfully do either. My dear father was the tendere[s]t, the fonde[s]t of parents, and [s]trained, to the utmost, his little income, to procure for me an education be[s]itting a gentlewoman. He placed me as a boarder in a convent near Abbeville, his place of re[s]idence, that he might keep a watchful eye upon my conduct; for the honour of his family and that of my mother's were ever dear to his heart, and he often [s]aid that he would [s]ooner [s]ee me in my coffin, whil[s]t a child, than have me live to fully the name I bore and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-563.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] family I [s]prung from. My life pa[s][s]ed in uninterrupted tranquillity, 'till I was seventeen, at which period a Mademoi[s]elle St. Farr was going to leave the convent and marry. She had ever conceived a great esteem for me, was five years older than myself and had re[s]ided in the convent from the death of her father, which happened when [s]he was very young. She was a woman of an enlightened under[s]tanding, lovely in her per[s]on and elegant in her manners. She ever pre[s]erved that dignity, which renders our [s]ex re[s]pectable, yet mixed it with [s]uch charming vivacity, [s]uch [s]prightly wit and unaffected good humour that [s]he at once commanded re[s]pect and conciliated affection. I have been thus minute in my description of Mademoi[s]elle St. Farr, that you might not be [s]urpri[s]ed at my father's ready compliance with a reque[s]t [s]he made, that I [s]hould accompany her to Bru[s][s]els, and remain with her during the winter [s]ea[s]on. Young and volatile my heart bounded at the pro[s]pect of the liberty and plea[s]ure I hoped to enjoy under her protection. Her hu[s]band Mon[s]ieur Melville was a gallant man, and from the day of their marriage, promoted every entertainment that he imagined could give plea[s]ure to a young beautiful woman, ju[s]t emerged from the gloom of a convent. But Madame Melville was a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-564.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] woman of too much di[s]cernment to [s]uffer di[s][s]ipation and folly to have a moments ascendency over her mind. After [s]haring in the amu[s]ements of Bru[s][s]els a few weeks, [s]he expre[s][s]ed a wi[s]h of living in a more domestic manner, and retired to an elegant chatheaux, which her hu[s]band po[s][s]e[s][s]ed on the banks of the Seine. Thither I accompanied her: but, alas! [s]ir, my weak mind had been fa[s]cinated with the plea[s]ures of the gay world, and I had lo[s]t all ta[s]te for retirement, and rational [s]ociety. The account in [s]ome mea[s]ure for this change I mu[s]t candidly inform you, that during my [s]tay at Bru[s][s]els I had formed an acquaintance with an English gentleman of the name of Rook[s]by.--- He was a man of fortune, lived in an expensive [s]tile, and (I blu[s]h while I own it,) at that very time lived publicly with a woman of an abandoned character. But, he had paid me numberle[s]s attentions and a profu[s]ion of compliments, [s]o fascinating to the inxeperienced female heart, that I fancied, (fatal mi[s]take!) had he an affectionate wife, whom he loved; [s]he might reclaim him from the follies of which he [s]eemed [s]o fond. He had often profe[s][s]ed a pa[s][s]ion for me, but not openly, and there my errors commenced; for at his reque[s]t I forbore to mention his preten[s]ions to Mon[s]ieur [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-565.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] or Madame Melville. That lady [s]oon discovered the alteration in my [s]pirits, after my leaving Bru[s][s]els, and inquired into the cau[s]e. I evaded her kind que[s]tions: and [s]oon after her brother coming to their chatheaux on a vi[s]it brought Rook[s]by with him. My chagrin vani[s]hed; I was again chearful and happy. A change [s]o vi[s]ible could not e[s]cape Madame Melville's penetration; [s]he imagined it might be the attractions of her brother (who was in every re[s]pect her counterpart) which had made an impre[s][s]ion on my heart. With a [s]mile [s]he entreated my confidence; but by the unembarra[s][s]ed air with which I an[s]wered her interrogations [s]he di[s]covered her error. The [s]mile was changed to a look of apprehen[s]ion. "I hope Harriet, [s]aid [s]he, you have not li[s]tened to any flighty tales from that young Englishman. I do not like his character. My brother brought him here from a motive of friend[s]hip to endeavour to detach him from a [s]et of gamblers, who in combination with a very vile woman, are leading him blindfold to ruin. He is a very weak young man, and po[s][s]e[s][s]es no [s]tability." After this conver[s]ation [s]he kept a very [s]trict eye upon me, and [s]oon di[s]covered enough to make her think it nece[s][s]ary to [s]end me back to the convent [s]ooner than [s]he at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-566.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] fir[s]t intended. Rook[s]by followed me---I had not attempted to conceal from him the [s]entiments he had in[s]pired me with. We found means to corre[s]pond: he laid a plan for my e[s]cape from the convent, I followed his pernicious councils, and we were privately married; but under a [s]trict injunction never to divulge our marriage till he [s]hould give me leave. Imagining that obedience to him was now become my fir[s]t duty, I took a mo[s]t [s]olemn oath, never to reveal our union, though by [s]o doing, I could avert the heavie[s]t misfortune. Gracious Heaven! how little did I [s]u[s]pect the dreadful calamity, which then hovered over my head? Happy as I was, in having, as I then thought, [s]ecured him to my[s]elf, I [s]till felt a con[s]iderable alloy from the reflection that I had acted undutifully to my dear father; that I planted a dagger in his heart, perhaps incurred his heavie[s]t malediction, yet dared not [s]ue to him for pardon. Another [s]ource of di[s]quiet was, that whenever Mr. Rook[s]by was ab[s]ent for any length of time, I [s]u[s]pected he was with Clara the woman he had [s]o publicly kept. To divert the melancholy, the[s]e fears occa[s]ioned, he proposed going for a few weeks to Paris, and thither I accompanied him. I had been there but ten days when one night, as I was at the opera, dre[s][s]ed in the gaye[s]t [s]tile and in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-567.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] company with a woman to whom he had introduced me. Ju[s]t as the performance began, I [s]aw Madame Melville enter a box oppo[s]ite to me, led by a gentleman who[s]e face was from me. Judge, my dear [s]ir, if po[s][s]ible, my emotions, when he turned round to [s]eat him[s]elf, I di[s]covered my father. His pale dejected countenance [s]truck me with horror, an involuntary [s]hriek escaped me, he rai[s]ed his eyes, he [s]aw!---he know me!---"Great God!" [s]aid he, clasping his hands, and [s]unk from the [s]eat in a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility. What my feelings were at that moment, I will not, I cannot pretend to de[s]cribe; nor can I tell how I got round from the box where I [s]at to the one that contained my father. All was confusion; but the di[s]traction of my brain prevented my attending to any thing, but my parent, whom I [s]aw before me to all appearance dead!---And, alas! bitter reflection, murdered by my ingratitude and disobedience!--- When he began to recover, madame Melville hurried him out of the hou[s]e, and I followed them almo[s]t unknowingly into the carriage. My father [s]uffered me to hold his hands in mine, but did not [s]peak to me during the time we were going to Madame Melville hou[s]e. When we alighted, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-568.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] percieved he trembled [s]o he could [s]carcely [s]tand. I followed him into a parlour, where he [s]unk upon a [s]opha. I fell on my knees before him. Forgive me, father, dear father, forgive me." "Harriet," [s]aid he, "what am I to think from your appearance.---tell me, tell me in[s]tantly and without prevarication.---Are you married?" "Do not a[s]k me, I cannot an[s]wer."--- "Enough," [s]aid he, "I under[s]tand my dishonour."--- Oh! my father, will you not pronounce my pardon? "Yes," [s]aid he feebly, "may heaven eternally ble[s]s you and forgive you as I do now." When I heard of your departure from the Convent it was like a bolt of ice [s]hot through my heart. Oh! child, I have not had a moments peace [s]ince; but, if my pardon can give you comfort, from my [s]oul I pardon you---But you are di[s]honoured. Oh! my child, how have you forgot what was due--- He was proceeding; but his voice faultered and his head [s]unk on my [s]houlder, I thought it was a return of his faintne[s]s, and [s]hrieked for help. Alas! how [s]hall I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-569.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] proceed. The horrors of that moment will never be blotted from my memory. We rai[s]ed and laid him on the [s]opha, we [s]trove to revive him; but in vain. His noble [s]oul had never known di[s]honour, and the [s]prings of life before exhau[s]ted by [s]ickne[s]s and many afflictions gave way at once under the pre[s][s]ure of a calamity he was not prepared to bear. Oh! [s]ir, when I reflect on that night, when I remembered it was my folly, viper that I was, that [s]tung him to the heart, my brain turns round, and only that he forgave me, with his parting breath, the very idea would deprive me of rea[s]on. Madame Melville [s]uffered me to remain at her hou[s]e till the la[s]t duties ware paid to his beloved remains; but as my character was now become equivocal, [s]he forbore ever after to [s]hew me any countenance. I sincerely lamented the privation of her friendship, and the more as I found it was an example that was followed by every woman of character with whom [s]he was acquainted. My [s]ituation on that account became extremely painful, and I mentioned to Mr. Rook[s]by, my de[s]ire of returning to Abbeville, to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the [s]mall patrimony my father had left me. He acquiesced, and we [s]et forward immediately. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-570.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] Three months, three little months, pa[s][s]ed on in tranquillity, when my hu[s]band informed me he had particular bu[s]ine[s]s which called him to Bru[s][s]els, that it would be impossible for him to return, and he thought it mo[s]t expedient to [s]ell off what furniture, &c. we po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, and to [s]ettle at that place.--- Alas! my dear [s]ir, fond of his [s]ociety, and having no will but his, I he[s]itated not to comply. At Bru[s][s]els, a new [s]cene pre[s]ented it[s]elf; a [s]cene which gave me a pain, impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe! and which no one but a wife who loved as I did can po[s][s]ibly conceive.--- Mr. Rook[s]by renewed his connection with a [s]et of gamblers and [s]windlers, who live on the follies of the unwary.---He became their dupe and in a few months was a very beggar.---It was one hot afternoon, in the middle of Augu[s]t la[s]t, when overcome by the weight of the atmo[s]phere, and oppressed by my own reflections, I had retired to an arbour, which terminated the [s]mall [s]pace of garden belonging to the hou[s]e we occupied, and was endeavouring to divert my [s]orrow, by the peru[s]al of an Engli[s]h novel, which had been recommended to my notice. I was deeply intere[s]ted in the sorrows of the "Wel[s]h Heire[s]s," (who never having known the plea[s]ures of maternal ten [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-571.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] derne[s]s, felt her heart expand towards tho[s]e who[s]e affection [s]upplied the place of a mother.) My mind was occupied, my heart [s]oftened, the tears [s]tole from my eyes, but they were tears that flowed from a [s]ource [s]o plea[s]ing, I wi[s]hed not to [s]top their cour[s]e: for while [s]ympathy for poor Anna's distresses awakened my [s]en[s]ibility, I felt the mo[s]t exqui[s]ite delight in the remembrance that there was an author, a female author [3] , who in conjunction with a Burney and Lee would [s]natch the Briti[s]h novel from oblivion, and future ages [s]hould with plea[s]ure peru[s]e the productions of her pen. Pardon me, [s]ir, but with [s]uch fervour do I revere tho[s]e superlatively happy few, who to a brilliant cultivated under[s]tanding, add a fertile natural genius, an elegant refined ta[s]te, and great [s]en[s]ibility, all other [s]ubjects are forgotten, and I am like a rapt enthu[s]ia[s]t, all wonder and veneration. But to return to my[s]elf, I was employed in the peru[s]al of the Wel[s]h Heire[s]s, when Rook[s]by with a hurried [s]tep and embarra[s][s]ed air entered the arbour: he [s]at down be[s]ide me, [s]truck his hand again[s]t his forehead, and breathed a [s]igh that seemed to come from his heart. My dear uncle mu[s]t have a bad opinion of my heart, if he thinks fictitious di[s]tre[s]s could longer engro[s]s my thoughts, and though he had been from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-572.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] me then above a fortnight, yet as I knew he was my hu[s]band---I al[s]o knew it was my duty to receive him on his return with a [s]mile, and, if po[s][s]ible, alleviate the afflictions which [s]eemed to oppre[s]s him. I threw a[s]ide my book and taking his hand inquired the cau[s]e of this vi[s]ible dejection. He told me he was ruined pa[s]t redemption, that he had even lo[s]t more than he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed the means to pay.---Unexperienced, my heart overflowing with affection, I endeavoured to [s]ooth his [s]orrows; and to calm the immediate perturbation of his mind, I put into his hands almo[s]t the whole of my worldly po[s][s]e[s][s]ions: for I thought the mo[s]t abject poverty preferable to [s]eeing him labour under [s]uch dejection of [s]pirits. He left me [s]oon after and I, vi[s]ionary like, amu[s]ed my[s]elf with the hope of [s]eeing him return (after he had paid his debts of honour) a true penitent, and that [s]ome little might be left from the wreck of his fortune, on which we might live in decent competence retired from the world, and yet enjoy all the real ble[s][s]ings of life. But, alas! [s]ir, the[s]e plea[s]ing, delu[s]ive hopes la[s]ted but a [s]hort time. Night advanced, and Rook[s]by did not return! Day after day pa[s][s]ed, and I [s]aw him not! I [s]ent to inquire after him---he was [s]till with his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-573.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] dissolute companions!---A fortnight passed in the horrors of the mo[s]t torturing suspense--- at the expiration of which, the following inchorent [s]crawl was put into my hand.

I know I de[s]erve it, yet do not, dear Harriet, do not, cur[s]e me. The peru[s]al of this horrid billet threw me into a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility, and when I recovered the power of thinking, it was too late My hu[s]band was [s]et off for England. I would have followed; but a fever occasioned by the agitation of my [s]pirits, consined me to my bed. Long and doubly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-574.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] tedious were the hours of [s]ickne[s]s, as they prevented my following and even in pri[s]on attending him. The anxiety of mind retarded my recovery, and I [s]elt my[s]elf much hurt and neglected at receiving no tidings from Mr. Rook[s]by. At one moment, I thought him dead! at another, langui[s]hing on a bed of [s]ickne[s]s. At length, I heard by accident, that he was recovered from the con[s]equence of his wound, and this intellgence in [s]ome mea[s]ure relieving my anxiety, I began to regain my health, and when I was able [s]et forward for England. On my arrival in London, I went to a Mr. Le Sage, whom I had often heard Mr. Rook[s]by mention was his banker.

I am now under her protection. She has held forth to me the hand of benevolence---though, much I fear, [s]he has [s]carcely the means to [s]upport her[s]elf, as [s]he told me the other day that [s]he mu[s]t leave the hou[s]e [s]he was then in, and di[s]charge her [s]ervants, as her income would afford nothing but the necessaries of life; yet added [s]he, with a [s]mile of friendly attention, [s]mall as my power is, you [s]hall be welcome to [s]hare with me the little I have left.

All I reque[s]t is means to return to France, and [s]pend the remainder of my days as a pensioner in a convent, where by a con[s]tant cour[s]e of penitence and prayer I may in [s]ome measure atone for my offences.---One thing more. I hardly know how to write it; but--- a few months will make me a mother.

I have no means to [s]upport him, and may you, dear [s]ir, teach him to avoid the vices of his father, and whenever he [s]ees a wretched for[s]aken woman, to pity and endeavour to comfort her, in remembrance of the [s]orrows of his mother.---In hopes of your pardon and protection, I beg leave to [s]tile my[s]elf your Dutiful Niece. HARRIET VENABLES. [3] Mrs. Bennett, author of Juvenile Indi[s]cretions ,  &c. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-576.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] It was not long after this letter was dispatched before Mr. Prevott came and per[s]onally offered to Harriet an a[s]ylum in his hou[s]e. Their meeting was tender I [s]hared her joys as far as my own unhappy [s]ituation would permit, but cordial as was the offered friend[s]hip of her uncle I could perceive he felt, [s]everely felt, poor Harriet's di[s]honour. I was greatly relieved by her having found [s]o able, [s]o proper a protector; for indeed, my dear Celia, I was reduced very low, and two days after [s]he left me I removed from the hou[s]e at Pimlico and which we had taken ready furni[s]hed. I di[s]charged my [s]ervant and would have per[s]uaded good Deborah to return to Wales to her friends, offering to pay her expen[s]es home. But this was attempting an impo[s][s]ibility. She told me I might [s]end her from my pre[s]ence; but no power [s]hould force her from London. She would remain near me, nay, [s]he would [s]erve me while [s]he had life. Such a proof of di[s]intere[s]ted [s]idelity awakened all my gratitude, and from that moment I took her for my companion, my friend, my advi[s]er, and we removed together to a [s]mall lodging near the King's bench pri[s]on, where poor Rook[s]by was by this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-577.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] time removed; for his di[s]tre[s][s]es were [s]o complicated and his affairs in [s]uch a distracted [s]tate it was impo[s][s]ible to procure his enlargement. Here it was I fir[s]t began my letter to you, in which I meant to have included the whole account of my [s]ad change, but my dear girl [s]ickened with the mea[s]les, and after langui[s]hing near a month was taken to eternal bli[s]s. I fear, my beloved Celia, I behaved in a manner unbecoming a Chri[s]tian, I did not [s]ubmit as I ought I gave way to de[s]pair and was puni[s]hed by the lo[s]s of rea[s]on, for [s]everal weeks. In this [s]ituation Kingly once more[s]tepped forward to pre[s]erve and re[s]cue me from the horrors of a mad hou[s]e; for to that dreadful [s]tate, or perhaps wor[s]e to that of a poor wandering lunatic de[s]titute and forlorn, I might have been reduced but for his timely interpo[s]ition. He had me removed to his own lodgings, attended by the be[s]t Phy[s]icians, nay, he even extended his benevolence to my unfortunate hu[s]band, who[s]e feelings had been [s]trongly awakened by the death of his child. But tho[s]e feelings were [s]oon overcome, and his heart again become calous. When I fir[s]t began to recover my recollection, it was carefully concealed from me where I was. Deborah by degrees informed me of all that had pa[s][s]ed and told me Kingly reque[s]ted to [s]ee me. I was too weak in mind and body to re[s]i[s]t, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-578.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] and for [s]ome time I was accu[s]tomed to pa[s]s an hour or two with him every day, I [s]aw not the danger, the impropriety of my situation, till rou[s]ed from my dream of [s]ecurity by the following circum[s]tance. I was well enough to leave my apartment for the adjoining room, where I had dined for the fir[s]t time with Kingly, who, as he [s]aid, to [s]urprize me agreeably had [s]ent for his dear boys from [s]chool, and al[s]o Clara's two children, whom he has taken under his protection. At the fir[s]t [s]ight of the children my [s]orrows all revived and I gave wayto a violent bur[s]t of tears, which relieved the oppression that [s]eemed like a cord to be bound round my heart. I wept plentifully, nor did any one attempt to prevent me. The dear children had all by degrees drawn nearer to me, and the younge[s]t boy climbing on my lap, wiped off my tears with his frock, whil[s]t he ki[s][s]ed me and bade me not cry any more. I know not how it was; but the angui[s]h of my heart gradually [s]ub[s]ided. I am not de[s]titute of comfort [s]aid I mentally; the[s]e dear children, the friend[s]hip of Kingly, is [s]omething yet! how many at this moment, a thou[s]and times more de[s]erving, are more wretched, more forlorn than I am. During dinner the[s]e reflections occupied my mind. I [s]poke little, but I felt a degree of [s]erenity [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-579.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] pervade my brea[s]t, to which it had long been a [s]tranger. When the de[s]ert was removed, the boys growing rather boi[s]terous in their play were di[s]mi[s][s]ed to another apartment. Kingly [s]eated him[s]elf next me. We were for [s]ome moments [s]ilent. "I hope," [s]aid Kingly, "my dear Mrs. Rook[s]by, you will now [s]oon be able to reap the benefit of fre[s]h air, and go for a [s]hort time into the country. It will be of great [s]ervice to you." "I hope I [s]hall," replied I, "[s]oon be able to go out; for then I can go to poor Rooksby, for I wi[s]h to [s]ee him and learn how he is accommodated; I fear he has been very uncomfortable during my illne[s]s."---"Surely my dear creature," [s]aid he, fixing his eyes on my face with a look of expre[s][s]ive tenderness, "[s]urely you cannot mean to return to that man." "Why not, Mr. Kingly. He certainly wants a friend and comforter under his pre[s]ent unea[s]y circum[s]tances."--- "But are not his pre[s]ent calamities the fruit of his own folly; and has he not behaved in the ba[s]e[s]t manner to you? has he not forfeited all right--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-580.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] "Not to my duty and attention," [s]aid I, eagerly interrupting him, "if he has forgot his duty, it is no rule for me to neglect mine." "But [s]hould you leave him, all the world would acquit you." "Yes Kingly; but I mu[s]t be acquitted by a higher, a more [s]acred tribunal than the world. I [s]eek the approbation of my own con[s]cience, and the continued protection of a Being; wi[s]e! as he is great and merciful."--- "But [s]urely, my dear Meriel, as you have done your duty, nothing more can be expected from you." "Yes Kingly, yes while I live, and Rooksby is in exi[s]tence I know my marriage vow is in full force; and may I [s]oon be able to fulfill the [s]acred engagements I entered into." "Oh! Meriel you [s]urely love, [s]pite of his errors this ungrateful Rook[s]by." "No---no,---mi[s]take me not, I mean not to arrogate to my[s]elf the merit of a virtue to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-581.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] which I have no claim. I pity him from my [s]oul, nay would [s]acrifice my own peace; to re[s]tore his tranquillity; but did I love him; Oh! gracious heaven, did I love him, I could not live and retain my rea[s]on under my present circum[s]tances." "Then, why Meriel, why will you sacrifice your own peace, to a chimerical notion of duty? If you love him not, why return to him: why fly from a man, who not only loves, but almo[s]t adores you? Then [s]tay with me, thou beloved of my [s]oul, [s]hare my fortune and be the friend of my bo[s]om; Rook[s]by [s]hall enjoy all the comforts, nay if you require it, all the elegancies of life." Shall I tell you, my friend, [s]hall I confess that [s]trong as was my [s]en[s]e of rectitude, I felt my re[s]olution [s]lacken. My treacherous heart even debated whether I [s]hould not [s]tand excu[s]ed, if I accepted his offer.---Oh, God! pardon the weakne[s]s of frail humanity, if for a moment, I forgot what was due to the Deity I [s]erved---the religion I profe[s][s]ed. Yes, Celia, I li[s]tened, I thought my[s]elf convinced, and had consented to leave the man to whom I had promised love and obedience to the late[s]t period of our lives. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-582.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] Kingly, though ardent in his wi[s]hes for me to be [s]eperated from my hu[s]band, was re[s]pectful in his behaviour and we pa[s][s]ed the evening in a friendly conver[s]ation, which would not have called a blu[s]h on the cheek of a brother and [s]i[s]ter. Deborah had during my illne[s]s always. [s]lept in my apartment. But a few nights preceding the one I have mentioned, we had prevailed on her to go to another room and [s]uffer one of Kingly's [s]ervants to occupy her place on a mattre[s]s by my bed-[s]ide. When I was retired to re[s]t, when I no longer [s]aw the expre[s][s]ive countenance, or heard the per[s]ua[s]ive tongue of Kingly, reflection returned with double force, and I perceived I was [s]tanding on the brink of a precipice, from which if I receded not in time, I mu[s]t plunge into everla[s]ting ruin. Weak as I [s]till was from the effects of my disorder, I re[s]olved to fly, while I had [s]ufficient rea[s]on left to direct me from the dangerous temptations which [s]urrounded me.---Forsaken, injured by my hu[s]band, and under the immediate protection of the man, who fir[s]t taught my heart to beat with affection, who had conferred on me obligations I could never repay, who [s]till loved:---And, Oh! my dear Celia, (the glow of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-583.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] confusion covers me as I write it,) who [s]till was beloved by me. To deliberate a moment; was to be lo[s]t, another [s]uch an interview as the la[s]t, and I might ru[s]h on irretrievable de[s]truction. The [s]ervant who [s]lept in the room with me, wearied by the employments of the day enjoyed a [s]ound and undi[s]turbed repo[s]e.--- The clock had [s]truck three, when convinced of the danger of remaining longer under his roof, I re[s]olved to fly from Kingly. A candle was always burning in my room: I aro[s]e with as little noi[s]e as po[s][s]ible, wrapping myself as warm as I could and tying up a change of linen in a handkerchief, I glided [s]oftly down [s]tairs, and opening the [s]treet door ventured into the [s]treet. I knew there were coaches employed in the night as well as the day, and did not fear but I [s]hould [s]oon find one to convey me to the hou[s]e where I had lodged, previous to the death of my ever regretted Clementina, and where I knew I [s]hould be received and might remain till the hour when I could be admitted into the pri[s]on to my hu[s]band. You will, perhaps, blame me, for leaving the protection of Kingly, in [s]o abrupt a manner. Perhaps you will [s]ay why not [s]tay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-584.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] till the morning, and then inform him of my re[s]olution.---Alas! my friend, I dared not [s]tay. I was [s]en[s]ible of the weakne[s]s of my heart, and had he intreated! had he looked unhappy! I know it would not have been in my power to per[s]evere. His lodgings were in We[s]tmin[s]ter near the park, and I found no [s]tand of coaches near. Add to this, my weakne[s]s and the penetrating keenne[s]s of the night air, made my head [s]wim, and I [s]taggered like a person intoxicated. I was proceeding as well as I was able toward We[s]tmin[s]ter bridge, when a cry of thieves and a watchman's rattle arrested my attention. I was then near the end of Parliament-[s]treet, and before I had time for a moments thought found my[s]elf [s]urrounded by a number of watchmen, constables and other [s]trange looking people, who one and all, per[s]i[s]ted that I was an accomplice with a gang of thieves, who had, by the a[s][s]i[s]tance of the hou[s]ekeper, broke in and robbed a lady's hou[s]e in Georgestreet. I attempted to [s]peak; but had not the power. A cold chillne[s]s [s]eized me, and my limbs failed, though I [s]till retained my senses and felt the horrors of my [s]ituation in their full force!---Imagine, my dear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-585.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] Celia, for a moment what my feelings were. I feared my rea[s]on would again wander: but it plea[s]ed Heaven to pre[s]erve me from that dreadful calamity. They conveyed me without re[s]i[s]tance to the watch-hou[s]e, where they threw me like a bea[s]t upon the floor, imagining my inanimation to proceed from the effects of liquor. Though unable to [s]peak, I groaned pitiou[s]ly and felt the tears gu[s]h in torrents from my eyes: but [s]till I was unnoticed by all, except a young creature who I am [s]ure could not have counted above [s]ixteen years, and who habited in a white bedgown, a tattered [s]ilk petticoat, and a pair of old [s]attin [s]hoes that would [s]carcely [s]ave her feet from the ground, [s]at in a corner of the place near where they had thrown me down; and as I then verily believed, where I was to end my days. For the sudden [s]hock that had deprived me of the power of [s]peech and motion [s]eemed like the [s]troke of death, and I li[s]ted up my [s]oul to that Power who I thought was calling me to him[s]elf from a world, where from a child, I had experienced little el[s]e but [s]orrow. The poor girl, whom I heard them call Peggy, knelt down be[s]ide me rai[s]ed my head on her knee and put a [s]mall gla[s]s of warm punch to my mouth, which the constable had ju[s]t given her.---"Let her alone [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-586.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] Peggy, [s]aid he, [s]he has had enough already. She is [s]o drunk [s]he can neither [s]peak nor [s]tand.--- "Poor [s]oul," cried Peggy, in an accent of the [s]ofte[s]t compa[s][s]ion. "She is ill I can [s]ee [s]he is, and may die for want of assistance. Come, continued [s]he, [s]wallow a drop of this. It may revive you." Celia, the love of life is [s]o [s]trongly impressed on human nature, that though bending beneath the weight of almo[s]t insupportable afflictions we [s]truggle [s]till to pre[s]erve exi[s]tence. I [s]wallowed the offered refreshment, Peggy chaffed my hands and laid my head upon her bo[s]om; my [s]pirits revived, my [s]trength began to return and in le[s]s than half an hour I could articulate my thanks to my pre[s]erver. Till ten the en[s]uing morning I remained in this mi[s]erable place, nor was I even able to procure the lea[s]t accommodation for my[s]elf or companion in sorrow; for they had not only taken my bundle from me but even ri[s]led my pockets of a guinea and a half, which was all that I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed in the world. At ten o'clock a coach was called and with [s]everal others I was carried to a ju[s]tice's for examination; for it was alledged that I was the woman, who had opened the door to the thieves and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-587.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] that having got what booty I could my[s]elf, I was making off when they [s]topped me; in evidence of which they produced my little bundle which contained two [s]hifts a petticoat two mu[s]lin handkerchiefs and a linen gown. The con[s]table al[s]o [s]wore that I had more property about me; but that I had thrown it away when they pur[s]ued me and they could find nothing but a gold watch chain which they had picked up, and which they immediately produced wrapped in a fine cambrick handkerchief. Judge my [s]urprize, Celia, when on opening the handkerchief I [s]aw my own watch chain, to which was fixed a miniature of my departed child [s]et round with pearls, and on which I had de[s]ired Deborah to rai[s]e [s]ome money, I imagine the faithful creature had deceived me and raised the money on [s]omething of her own---yet how the chain could be dropped by me was a my[s]tery, unle[s]s as I have [s]ince rea[s]on to think it was with the gown I had packed up and might drop from the bundle. During my examination, a coach [s]topped at the door and an elderly lady entered. It was the lady, who[s]e hou[s]e had been attempted. The moment [s]he [s]aw me [s]he pronounced me not guilty. I never [s]aw her before, [s]aid [s]he, with visible emotion, and even had [s]he lived in my hou[s]e. I could not have [s]u[s]pected her.--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-588.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] I cannot, my dear Celia, de[s]cribe this lady to you [s]uch as [s]he appeared to me. There was a mixture of maje[s]ty and conde[s]cen[s]ion in her manner, her countenance beamed benignity, and it appeared a countenance rendered grave by affliction rather than that by nature. Several other per[s]ons were now brought in, who had been apprehended by other watchmen, and from a variety of evidences I was acquitted; when I heard tho[s]e words pa[s]s the ju[s]tice's lips, I was ha[s]tily leaving the place, but a man [s]topped me and told me I could not go till I had paid all fees.---"Indeed [s]ir," [s]aid I, in a voice [s]carcely audible, "I have no money; that watch chain I think was mine, yet how it came here I know not nor dare I demand it. Permit me to go and if ever it is in my power"---"I [s]hall do no [s]uch thing, mistress," [s]aid the man, "either pay the fees or [s]tay in our cu[s]tody till you can." I could not an[s]wer, but rai[s]ing my hands and eyes to heaven was returning in [s]ilent agony when the lady advanced and inquired the cau[s]e of my new di[s]tre[s]s. "And are the[s]e your Briti[s]h laws" [s]aid [s]he, "that when a per[s]on is fal[s]ely accu[s]ed and their innocence made perfectly appear, are they to be detained from their families [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-589.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] for the paltry con[s]ideration of a few shillings?" She then put her hand in her pocket and pre[s]ented me with two guineas, at the [s]ame time a[s]king if [s]he could be of any further [s]ervice to me; I would have thanked her, but my feelings were too powerful to permit me to [s]peak, [s]he [s]aw my gratitude, [s]he perfectly comprehended from my looks more than words would convey.---"You intere[s]t me," [s]aid [s]he, "can you not tell me how I may [s]erve you. Oblige me, madam; make me your friend I will not abu[s]e your confidence; but pardon me, I am to blame. This is no place for conver[s]ation. Do me the favour to wait till I have fini[s]hed the di[s]agreeable bu[s]ine[s]s that brought me here, and then give me leave to take you to any place you wi[s]h to go to in my carriage."---I curt[s]yed my a[s][s]ent to this humane propo[s]al, for indeed Celia, I was unable to walk, and could but ill afford to procure a coach. Harra[s][s]ed as my [s]pirits had been, my [s]trength was exhausted and I was almo[s]t [s]inking with faintness. When the lady had ended her bu[s]ine[s]s, [s]he de[s]ired me to follow her, ju[s]t as we were [s]tepping out of the door, poor Peggy who was ju[s]t relea[s]ed, pa[s][s]ed us on the [s]teps.--- "Forgive me, madam," [s]aid I, "if I presume to [s]hare with this benevolent girl, the bounty of your hand. She did all in her power la[s]t night for me, I fear I [s]hould have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-590.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] peri[s]hed, but for her humanity."---I then gave her the remainder of the guinea I had changed to pay the fees of the office. "God ble[s]s you," [s]aid [s]he, pre[s][s]ing the hand that offered her the money, while the tears started in her fine blue eyes. "And was [s]he kind to you?" [s]aid the lady. I repeated the circum[s]tance of the preceding night. "Good girl," [s]aid [s]he, "have you any friends?" addre[s][s]ing Peggy. "Oh! no Madam," I am a poor, guilty, forlorn creature: lo[s]t to every thing but a [s]en[s]e of my own mi[s]ery." "So young, and yet accu[s]e your[s]elf of guilt." "Alas Madam, I was involved in guilt before I knew the value of virtue." The lady an[s]wered not; but giving her a card, bade her call on her in the afternoon, and [s]he would do [s]omething for her. "And now," [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he [s]eated herself in her carriage, "tell me where you wi[s]h to go." "To the Kings bench pri[s]on, madam." "To a pri[s]on, good heavens! have you friends there?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-591.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] "My hu[s]band, madam, is confined there." "Have you any children? "I had, madam, one, a [s]weet girl:--- but"---I could not proceed. I turned my face from her, and we both remained [s]ilent for [s]everal minutes.--- "I too," [s]aid the lady, [s]tarting as it were from a deep reverie. "I too, once had a child---a girl---nay, perhaps have [s]till; but for many! many! years, [s]he has been lo[s]t to me." When we drew near to the end of our little journey, [s]he told me [s]he felt inclined to be my friend, and if I would do her the favour to call at her hou[s]e and point out the means, [s]he would readily exert her utmo[s]t abilities to alleviate the afflictions, which [s]eemed to pre[s]s [s]o heavily upon me. She then told me her name was Harcourt and wi[s]hed me a good morning. Weak, oppre[s][s]ed, dejected my trembling limbs being [s]carce able to [s]upport me, I slowly a[s]cended the [s]tairs, which led to the apartment occupied by Rook[s]by. The door was opened. I was ju[s]t entering, but a [s]ight met my eyes that almo[s]t annihilated me. It was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-592.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] Rook[s]by [s]eated be[s]ide his infamous Clara, with tea and coffee on the table before them. From their own di[s]habille and the appearance of the room, I perceived they were but ju[s]t ri[s]en. I know not what I [s]aid in the fir[s]t moment of [s]urprize, but I remember clasping my forehead hard with both my hands and exclaiming, "grant me patience heaven." As I ran down [s]tairs, my brain [s]eemed whirling in perpetual motion and had I not been detained by one of the keepers of the pri[s]on I fear I [s]hould have ru[s]hed into the [s]treet in a [s]tate little [s]hort of in[s]anity. The recollection of what I then [s]uffered is too much for my weak [s]pirits. I cannot proceed in my narrative. Adieu, my friendly Celia, I am now in a place of [s]afety and will, when I am able, inform you of every occurrence down to the pre[s]ent time. Heaven ble[s]s you. MERIEL.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-593.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] I hardly dare take up my pen to write to the worthy On[s]low: for I have rendered my[s]elf totally unworty of his friendship. Will you and your amiable Amelia believe it? No you will think it impo[s][s]ible, that I---I, who [s]o often have [s]worn to protect her, [s]hould act in [s]o thoughtle[s]s a manner as to drive the lovely Meriel from my hou[s]e. Yes, On[s]low, [s]he left my hou[s]e in the night, unattended and ru[s]hed into dangers, of which her delicate mind could form no idea; and my folly was the cau[s]e. I forgot what was due to her honour and my own, and dared to [s]olicit her to quit her husband and remain with me. Oh! fool, madman that I was, when I knew the dignity of her mind, to think [s]he would [s]uffer [s]uch a thought to harbour in her bo[s]om for a moment. She once loved me;---yes, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-594.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] with a voice [s]oft as harmony, yet with looks and manners cha[s]te as Diana, has [s]he lately confe[s][s]ed [s]he [s]till does and ever [s]hall love me. But did I not know the heart of Meriel Howard. Was I not [s]en[s]ible, that with all her [s]exes [s]oftne[s]s [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed the firmne[s]s and intrepidity of a Spartan matron? But I am tormenting you with [s]u[s]pen[s]e while I am writing an eulogium on her, with who[s]e virtues you are already well acquainted. The dear creature had recovered [s]o far as to be able to leave her apartment, when the conver[s]ation pa[s][s]ed between us, which frightened her from the protection I had vainly hoped would have henceforth sheltered her from all the ills of life. She had [s]upped with me, and on retiring, wi[s]hed me a good night with a look and voice [s]o full of tenderne[s]s, that I longed to pre[s]s her to my heart: but I forbore and only ki[s][s]ed her hand. Early the next morning, I was awakened by poor Doborah, who a[s]ked me if I knew where her lady was---for [s]he was not in her apartment, nor had the [s]ervant who [s]lept in her room [s]een her. Terrified, lea[s]t her unfortunate malady [s]hould have returned, I ha[s]tily aro[s]e and inquired of every per[s]on in the hou[s]e if they had [s]een her; but to no purpo[s]e. The [s]treet door was found unlock'd and on [s]earching her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-595.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] apartment her hat and cloak with a few necessaries were mi[s][s]ing. It then ru[s]hed into my mind that her own [s]en[s]ibility and [s]trict [s]en[s]e of rectitude had driven her from my protection. Where could [s]he go? Her friends or rather tho[s]e who had once [s]tiled themelves [s]o, had all for[s]aken her in her misfortunes---to whom then could [s]he go? Di[s]tracting as the thought was, I concluded [s]he was gone to her ba[s]e treacherous husband. Impre[s][s]ed with this idea, I went immediately to the pri[s]on; but [s]he had not been there. I did not attempt to [s]ee Rooksby, I could not have [s]poken to him with calmne[s]s. I returned home almo[s]t deprived of rea[s]on, nor had I any tidings of the dear fugitive, till late in the afternoon, when I received the following note. You are no doubt unea[s]y; let this calm your fears, I am [s]afe. Rea[s]on told me I mu[s]t not remain any longer with you. I came to my hu[s]band; but [s]omething has occurred, which I cannot now explain, and which makes it impo[s][s]ible for me to remain with him. We have parted, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-596.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] believe, forever.---But I charge you, Kingly, endeavour not to find me out,---I wi[s]h not to [s]ee you again. It is meddling world. They have been already too bu[s]y with our names.---Think me not ungrateful for your friend[s]hip: it will never be obliterated from my mind while I have life; but it is fit, it is proper we [s]hould meet no more.--- I know my faithful Deborah will wi[s]h to come to me. Bid her come with the bearer of this, who waits. But oh! Kingly, unle[s]s you wi[s]h to add another weight to my already in[s]upportable afflictions, make no attempt to [s]ee me.---Heaven ble[s]s you, forever ble[s]s you, I cannot expre[s]s all I wi[s]h; perhaps did I feel le[s]s, I could write with more eloquence.---As my la[s]t reque[s]t I intreat you not to withdraw your bounty from the children of Clara. They are innocent, whatever are the crimes of their parents. Oh Kingly, if you could [s]ee my heart, you would [s]ee it bleed with real angui[s]h, while I tell you we mu[s]t not cannot meet again. Once more, God ble[s]s you, and reward you for your kindne[s]s to the wretched MERIEL. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-597.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] Though I earne[s]tly de[s]ired to [s]ee the suffering angel, her commands, her pathetic entreaties to me were [s]acred; I [s]ent for Deborah and giving her ten guineas bade her ha[s]ten to her mi[s]tre[s]s and to let me know when [s]he wanted more ca[s]h. The faithful old woman [s]obbed with joy when I told her that her lady was [s]afe; and left the room almo[s]t with the alacrity of a girl, when [s]he was told to follow the me[s][s]enger who brought the letter. The next morning, the money was returned in a [s]mall parcel, which I received and opened without knowing from whence it came. On the inner paper were the[s]e words. "Dear generous Kingly, I am already overwhelmed with obligations from you. Pardon me, I can receive no more." There was no name annexed; but I knew the dear characters had been traced by the hand of Meriel.--- Re[s]olved, if po[s][s]ible, [s]till to [s]erve her, even again[s]t her inclination, I went to my agent and de[s]ired him to go to the bench, make inquiry for Deborah and pretend to pay [s]ome money that was owing to old Mr. Howard. But here I failed; for when my agent returned, he informed me that Mrs. Rook[s]by had been with her hu[s]band that [s]he remained only a [s]hort time and where [s]he was gone no one could tell. He al[s]o informed me [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-598.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] that Rook[s]by had a woman in the apartment with him, who had been thrown into pri[s]on about three weeks before by a Mercer, to whom [s]he was indebted upwards of a hundred pounds, and that both of them expected [s]oon to be relea[s]ed. From his de[s]cription of the woman's per[s]on, I [s]hould [s]uppo[s]e it to be the infamous Clara; but think it almo[s]t impossible, as I was informed [s]he was living at Bru[s][s]els only a [s]hort time [s]ince in great [s]plendor with a man of the fir[s]t rank and fortune. Should it prove [s]o, I [s]hall pronounce him a blacker villain than I ever thought him: and how like an angel will the villainy of the one and the ingratitude of the other make Meriel appear, who in the very moment that [s]he was [s]o cruelly treated by them could recommend their children to my care. I will obey her, On[s]low. They [s]hall [s]hare the education of my own boys, and I make no doubt of being able to provide for them either in the army or navy.--- Every inquiry after Meriel is vain. She has hid her[s]elf [s]o effectually as to elude the [s]tricte[s]t [s]earch; I can no longer [s]tay in England I have [s]olicited employment in the We[s]t Indies and [s]hall [s]oon [s]ail. I have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-599.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] commissioned my agent to continue his [s]earch for Mrs. Rook[s]by and [s]hould he di[s]cover the place of her retreat to [s]upply her with ca[s]h, without [s]uffering her even to [s]u[s]pect from whom it comes. I am certain wherever [s]he is, [s]he is in nece[s][s]ity. Good heavens, that I [s]hould live to [s]ay, while I am in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of all the [s]uperfluities of life, Meriel Howard, the fir[s]t choice of my heart, the woman I love and revere above all her [s]ex, is perhaps languishing for want of the means to [s]upport existence. I will write no more I am almo[s]t devoid of rea[s]on when I think for a moment on the [s]ubject. I hardly dare de[s]ire my remembrance to your Amelia. I know how [s]he loved and e[s]teemed Meriel, and I have [s]ome faint hope that [s]he will hear from the dear sufferer's own hand how [s]he has di[s]po[s]ed of herself; for certain I am, that while life warms the heart of Meriel Howard, it will glow with grateful affection for Amelia Sidney. And while I live, I [s]hall remain your's in friend[s]hip. F. KINGLY. MERIEL to CELIA. May 20 th , 1789.

I informed you of my di[s]covery of Clara in the pri[s]on with Rook[s]by; but I am yet to inform you that when, by the humanity of one of the keepers, I was prevailed on to go into a room and endeavour to compo[s]e my[s]elf, I received a verbal me[s][s]age from my cruel tyrant, de[s]iring me to leave him to his fate and return to my favourite Kingly, with whom he knew I had publicly lived for [s]everal weeks in defiance of [s]hame. A me[s][s]age [s]o injurious, [s]o unju[s]t, rou[s]ed my re[s]entment, and I demanded to [s]ee the cruel man, who could thus dare to in[s]ult me. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-601.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] I once more a[s]cended the [s]tairs to his apartment, and knocking at the door, entered with as much re[s]olution, as I could a[s][s]ume. He received me with a mixture of confusion and contempt, and Clara, without deigning to ri[s]e from her [s]eat; gave a [s]light inclination of the head: but at that moment I felt my[s]elf a wife, an innocent injured wife! and re[s]entment conquered every other feeling!--- "Rook[s]by!" [s]aid I, [s]eating my[s]elf opposite to him, and regarding him with a fixed attention, "I come to inquire by what action of my life, I have incurred the unju[s]t cen[s]ures you have thrown upon me, or in what I have forfeited my claim to your regard, [s]ince I have been your wife." "By your vile connection with Belger, before you were my wife---and your [s]till more infamous intrigue with Kingly [s]ince!" [s]aid he, in a kind of hurried accent, as though con[s]cious he did not him[s]elf believe what he a[s][s]erted. "By all my hopes of future felicity, Rooksby," I replied, "I am innocent of what you accu[s]e me, as was the infant I bore--- and who, I tru[s]t, is now an angel in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-602.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] man[s]ions of the ble[s]t!"---At the recollection of my child, tears, in [s]pite of my efforts to [s]uppre[s]s them, bur[s]t from my eyes.--- Rook[s]by was affected. "Poor Clementina," [s]aid he, ri[s]ing and coming toward me, I [s]hould have liked to have [s]een her once more, before [s]he was gone forever." Clara, [s]aw [s]he was lo[s]ing ground; [s]o ri[s]ing in great ha[s]te, [s]he told him that when he had [s]ettled the difference that had been between us, perhaps, [s]he might look in and congratulate us; that content was a great ble[s][s]ing, and a forgiving temper, a [s]ure [s]ign of a good chri[s]tian; that for her part, [s]he had good rea[s]on to [s]uppo[s]e both Mrs. Belger and Mrs. Kingly fell victims to my art, for their hearts were broken by their hu[s]bands, who[s]e affections I had exerted my[s]elf to obtain, and had effectually drawn from them." "If," [s]aid I with more firmne[s]s than I believed my[s]elf capable of, "if every woman in the world was as free from the crime of [s]educing the affection of a hu[s]band from his wife as I am, it would be well for many. But, be not mi[s]taken, Clara, I come not to [s]ue to my hu[s]band, or endeavour to regain his heart, I am at length convinced I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-603.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] never po[s][s]e[s][s]ed it, and as it would have been happy for us, had we never met; I am determined that we will here part forever!!!" "Forever, Meriel," [s]aid Rook[s]by, "leave me forever?"--- Clara's countenance brightened, and [s]he re[s]umed her [s]eat. "I am well convinced, Rook[s]by," I replied, "that [s]o far from having it in my power to [s]erve or oblige you, my pre[s]ence is painful to you, and I am con[s]idered a burthen.---The pain, the burthen [s]hall therefore be removed." "And you will return to Kingly?" "No! Rook[s]by.---Here in the awful face of Heaven, I [s]wear, I never have, nor ever will di[s]honour the name of your revered mother: a name, which at her reque[s]t I received from you. And, that Heaven is my witne[s]s, was the chearful di[s]charge of my duty a [s]ource of happine[s]s to you, as no power on earth [s]hould [s]eperate me from you!---I would remain with you in the mo[s]t abject di[s]tre[s]s---comfort you--- nay, even labour for your [s]upport! but--- as it is---we mu[s]t part!!!---I forgive [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-604.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] you from my [s]oul, every injury---not only you! but, tho[s]e who have been the cau[s]e of your errors!---I will pray for your happine[s]s---and forget, if po[s][s]ible---how cruelly and how often you have wronged me!"--- "I am villain!" [s]aid he, ri[s]ing and striking his forehead with vehemence. "Before we part Rook[s]by," cried I, laying my hand on his arm, "I [s]olemnly conjure you as the la[s]t and only reque[s]t I [s]hall ever make, [s]eek not to palliate your own faults by taxing me with guilt. I am conscious of my own innocence, and feel not the [s]harpne[s]s of the accu[s]ation; but it increases your own offences in the [s]ight of Heaven!---I forgive every thing that has pa[s]t---only, throw not an odium on my character, and I will ble[s]s you forever!"--- "You are, you mu[s]t be innocent," [s]aid he, "I believe you are pure as an angel. You are a trea[s]ure too great for me to po[s][s]e[s]s. I have voluntarily thrown you from me, and though I know your worth, [s]ome [s]trange fatality ever pur[s]ues me, and the weakne[s]s of my nature hurries me to actions which I know are wrong." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-605.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] "Farewel!" [s]aid I, turning to leave the room. "But whither are you going, Meriel, I fear you are in want. My affairs begin to wear a better a[s]pect. I have had a few thousands left me by a relation. Let me know where to [s]end to you that you may [s]hare in my fortune, though I can never hope again to po[s][s]e[s]s a place in your heart.---His voice faultered and he actually [s]hed tears. Celia, Rook[s]by is a man [s]o weak [s]o un[s]table in his nature that the impul[s]e of the moment ever hurries him away: and perhaps ju[s]t then he would have [s]ued for a reconciliation and had he been ma[s]ter of the world offered to divide it with me. And the fir[s]t moment Clara had an opportunity to exert her art, [s]he would have revived all his [s]u[s]picions and I [s]hould again been ill treated, vilified, nay, perhaps thru[s]t like an abandoned wretch from his hou[s]e. Sen[s]ible of this ver[s]atility of temper I wished not to prolong our interview, be[s]ides I was faint and exhau[s]ted. The [s]pirits which resentment had rou[s]ed were now begining to [s]ub[s]ide and when I con[s]idered his errors and the weakne[s]s of his nature I only con[s]idered him as an object of compa[s][s]ion. The pre[s]ence of Clara too was in[s]upportably painful, I, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-606.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] therefore, almo[s]t forcibly tore my[s]elf from him and hurring down [s]tairs immediately left the pri[s]on, and went to the lodgings I had occupied before. The woman of the hou[s]e received me kindly. After I had taken [s]ome refre[s]hment I lay down and endeavoured to procure a little re[s]t; but the effort was ineffectual.--- The [s]cenes I had been engaged in the preceding night and day entirely occupied my thoughts; the idea of Kingly's [s]urprize and unea[s]ine[s]s when he [s]hould di[s]cover my having left him; the [s]orrow of my affectionate Deborah, my own forlorn [s]ituation, and dreary future pro[s]pect, all con[s]pired to bani[s]h from my eyes the balmy comfort of [s]leep. I aro[s]e, and procuring pens and paper, wrote a few lines to my hu[s]band informing him where I was, that he might not [s]ay I had prevented his a[s][s]i[s]ting me by not letting him know where to [s]end. I al[s]o wrote to Kingly in a manner which I knew would effectually prevent his endeavouring to [s]ee me; but de[s]ired him to [s]end Deborah back with the per[s]on, who brought the letter. I pa[s][s]ed the night in a very re[s]tle[s]s manner, and in the morning was unable to ri[s]e. A fever, want of appetite, and great lassitude, hung upon me for above ten days.--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-607.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] Indeed, I thought I was going into a rapid dicline; but the care of Deborah, who nursed me with ince[s][s]ant tenderne[s]s, and parted even with [s]ome of her apparel to procure me proper and nouri[s]hing food, re[s]tored me to [s]ome degree of my wonted [s]trength. During this time, I heard nothing from Rook[s]by: though perfectly [s]atisfied, that his [s]ickle di[s]po[s]ition had operated as u[s]ual, and that no longer [s]een, I was no longer remembered, yet [s]omething prompted me to [s]end to the bench and inquire after him. Deborah was my me[s][s]enger; [s]he returned and told me he had been relea[s]ed above a week. I then [s]ent to Le Sage; but without letting him [s]u[s]pect who made the inquiry, and learned that my hu[s]band, (Oh, Heavens! happy had I been, had he never borne that title!) had left England in company with Clara; for I particularly de[s]ired the per[s]on who inquired, to a[s]k, wherever he was, if he was alone. It was now time to think of [s]ome means of [s]upport, Gratitude al[s]o required that I [s]hould call on the benevolent Mrs. Harcourt. I dre[s][s]ed my[s]elf as neat as the [s]canty [s]tate of my wardrobe would allow and repaired to her hou[s]e. At my approach, I [s]aw the [s]hutters of the upper part were clo[s]ed; my heart [s]unk; but yet I ventured to knock [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-608.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] at the door. A woman [s]ervant opened it. I inquired for Mrs. Harcourt. "She is at "Bath," replied the woman. "Has [s]he been ill then?"---"Yes, [s]he caught cold on the night her hou[s]e was robbed, which added to the fright, brought on the gout in her [s]tomach. She was taken ill the next evening and for [s]everal days was thought in great danger; but [s]he is now better, and ye[s]terday morning [s]et off for Bath." I thanked the woman for her information and was going from the door, when who [s]hould I [s]ee cro[s]s the hall but Peggy. She [s]aw and in[s]tantly recollected me: an exclamation of joy and [s]urprize e[s]caped her and [s]he ran to the door to [s]peak to me. She informed me that Mrs. Harcourt had taken her into the hou[s]e as an a[s][s]i[s]tant to the hou[s]ekeeper that the kind lady had mentioned me previous to her departure, and de[s]ired if I called I would leave word where I might be found. I told Peggy I was not [s]ettled in any place at pre[s]ent; but I would call again in the cour[s]e of a fortnight when I hoped to hear of Mrs Harcourt's perfect recovery. On my return, I con[s]ulted with Deborah, what we could po[s][s]ibly do to earn a subsistence. The affectionate creature could think of nothing. She could only weep that I was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-609.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] obliged to have recour[s]e to work. After revolving many various [s]chemes in my mind, I at length fixed on one, that I thought was [s]ea[s]ible---It was to [s]end Deborah to the woman, who had formerly [s]upplied me with millinery, and to de[s]ire her to inquire in my name whether [s]he could give employment to a reputable young woman, who was in an ill [s]tate of health and only able to work at her own apartment. Deborah executed the commission faithfully and on her return told me [s]he had procured employment for me at a great warehou[s]e, where [s]he had been recommended by the per[s]on to whom I [s]ent her. "But dear madam," [s]aid [s]he, the prices are [s]o very [s]mall, you will never be able to live on what you earn."---This did not deter me. I removed to a room near the warehou[s]e for which I was to work; that our time might not be taken up in going backwards and forwards. Deborah procured the work and I executed it. I gave great [s]atisfaction and had as much as my[s]elf and Deborah could possibly do, yet with the mo[s]t indefatigable industry, we could [s]carcely earn eighteen or twenty [s]hillings a week. The clo[s]e application to my employment did not agree with my health, and I was obliged to devote an hour every day to exerci[s]e, nor did even this an[s]wer the de[s]ired end, and I was in a [s]hort [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-610.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] time [s]o pale and thin that you would scarcely have believed me to have been the Meriel Howard you once knew. Ill as I was, I [s]till continued my employment as well as I was able; but weakne[s]s and fatigue often overcame me and I was obliged to give up hours to re[s]t, and [s]ometimes whole days. My weakne[s]s encrea[s]ed, and my income proportionally decrea[s]ed. I [s]aw famine advancing with ha[s]ty [s]trides, and to add to my affliction I knew the affection of Deborah had involved her in my di[s]tre[s][s]es. My lodging was in Oxford-[s]treet, and I sometimes walked into the fields which are adjacent to the pari[s]h of Bloom[s]bury. One day, as with [s]low uneven pace I took my accustomed walk, ju[s]t as I had reached Gowerstreet, I [s]aw a [s]plendid equipage pa[s]s me and [s]top at a hou[s]e which [s]eemed newly [s]itted up. I cannot account for the curio[s]ity that [s]eized me; but I inquired of a man who had the appearance of a Butler; to whom the hou[s]e and carriage belonged. "To Mr. Howard" [s]aid the man---Mr. Howard; what Howard? "I don't know," he replied, "what his Chri[s]tian name is, but he is lately returned from India".--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-611.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] A[s]toni[s]hment rendered me [s]ilent, and the man proceeded.--- "He came over about two months [s]ince, and took that hou[s]e. I then lived the next door and knew all that pa[s][s]ed in the family. He brought a young lady over with him, who is very pretty; but [s]eems unhappy. She is very young indeed; and he is going to marry her; but I think it is again[s]t her inclination: for though I have heard the servants [s]ay [s]he [s]eemed to re[s]pect him, [s]he often declares [s]he can never love him.--- I mu[s]ed upon what the man had told me and was determined to inquire farther about this Mr. Howard. It might be my brother, and the [s]ums I had advanced it might now be in his power to return; not that I intended to a[s]k him for them but, methought, natural affection would certainly operate in his bo[s]om in behalf of a [s]i[s]ter who had [s]hared all her property with him and was now bent to the earth with [s]ickne[s]s and [s]orrow.---On farther inquiry I learned that his name was Richard Howard. Determined to make at lea[s]t a trial of him, I learned at what hour it would be mo[s]t likely to [s]ee him, for as he was become a great man, I readily conceived my only being his [s]i[s]ter and in di[s]tre[s]s would but poorly plead my excu[s]e for going [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-612.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] at an un[s]ea[s]onable time. Far be it from me, my dear Celia, to [s]ay this is the ca[s]e with all, there are [s]ome glorious ornaments of the creation who never turn from the cry of affliction, and who never con[s]ider it intru[s]ive; who[s]e hearts are ever open and who[s]e hands are ever ready to di[s]pen[s]e to tho[s]e who are in want, a part of tho[s]e blessings which a bounteous Providence has [s]howerd on them[s]elves:---but the thorough knowledge I have of the human heart led me to reflect, that when a per[s]on has unexpectedly ri[s]en to opulence from ob[s]curity, his feelings grow callous he forgets and totally neglects tho[s]e branches of his family who, though perhaps they have been equally indu[s]trious with him[s]elf, have not been equally the favourites of fortune. At ten o'clock one morning, I knocked at Mr. Howard's door; and was reque[s]ted by the [s]ervant to [s]end up my name, I did [s]o, adding that I had particular bu[s]ine[s]s with him. After waiting about ten minutes (for I [s]uppo[s]e my dre[s]s had not prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed the man in my favour.) I was told I might come up.---My limbs trembled as I entered the room. The fir[s]t glance convinced me it was my brother, though he is greatly increased in bulk, being now a very [s]tout man, and when we parted he was but a [s]lender [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-613.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] lad, yet his features were the [s]ame. He was [s]itting at breakfa[s]t with a very young lady, who appeared dejected and unhappy. I imagined this to be the per[s]on of whom the servant [s]poke. He gave a [s]light inclination of the head as I entered, the [s]ervant brought forward a chair and left the room. "Now madam," [s]aid the haughty ma[s]ter of the hou[s]e, "what is your plea[s]ure?" "Is it po[s][s]ible," [s]aid I, looking earne[s]tly at him, "that you can have no recollection of me?--- "Not the lea[s]t, I do not recollect that I ever [s]aw you before." "You had once a [s]i[s]ter, [s]ir.--- "Yes I had, but [s]he was always a [s]trange eccentric girl; [s]he ran through a very good fortune, and I under[s]tand has di[s]graced her family in the mo[s]t [s]hocking maner." "Brother," [s]aid I, emphatically, "and I felt my eyes gu[s]h out with tears.--- He [s]at down the cup, which he was rai[s]ing to his lips, and with a look of mingled anger [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-614.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] and a[s]toni[s]hment, cried, "why [s]urely you can never be Meriel Howard."--- "I am your [s]i[s]ter, I am all that remains of Meriel Howard, but I no longer bear that name."--- "I was told you had a[s][s]umed the name of a gentleman with whom you lived [s]ome years, but he has left you through your own folly."--- "And who could a[s][s]ert [s]uch a fal[s]ehood, brother?"--- "My Aunt Mo[s][s]op told me, and [s]o did He[s]ter, who is well married. Su[s]an wrote them word that you behaved in [s]uch a manner [s]ome few years [s]ince upon the continent, as occa[s]ioned the per[s]on you lived with to fight a duel on your account: that you seperated then and had never lived together [s]ince." The flight, the cutting indifference of my brother, wounded me to the [s]oul. I was debilitated in mind and body, yet I could hardly re[s]train the fulne[s]s of my heart; being unable to [s]upport the interview any longer, I aro[s]e to depart; for he had neither a[s]ked me to eat or drink. The young [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-615.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] lady looked at me, and I [s]aw the tear of compa[s][s]ion [s]tart in her eyes. "I am very [s]orry, Meriel," [s]aid my brother, "that you are in [s]uch indifferent circum[s]tances as your appearance [s]eems to be[s]peak, if a couple of guineas" "No, [s]ir!" [s]aid I, putting back the hand extended with the money, if I am unworthy to be received as your [s]i[s]ter, I am unworthy of your a[s][s]i[s]tance: be[s]ides, brother, I came in hopes to find an affectionate relative, a friend, who[s]e heart would compa[s][s]ionate my [s]ufferings. Di[s]appointed in that---I am too proud to accept a donation from your bounty!"---"As you plea[s]e, madam!" bowing coldly, "had you conducted your[s]elf in a manner becoming my [s]i[s]ter"--- "Brother, had I come to your door in a [s]plendid equipage, perhaps, you would not have inquired [s]o [s]trictly into my conduct. In that ca[s]e even the errors of which I am now accu[s]ed, would have been overlooked; but poverty is a fault the opulent can seldom pardon. I am happy, brother, to [s]ee the advancement of your fortune; but, [s]hould you ever experience a rever[s]e, you will then di[s]cover, that tho[s]e who now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-616.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] caress and flatter you, nay, even would creep into your favour by vilifying me, would be the fir[s]t to turn from you; and blame you for misfortunes you could neither avoid nor avert!" "I [s]ee Meriel," [s]aid he, "with a [s]neer, "you at lea[s]t retain one [s]triking trait in your character, you are as good a preacher as ever." "I will take care to retain every trait," I replied, "for which I have been re[s]pected. I have now lo[s]t the name of Howard, and can no longer di[s]grace it by my poverty; and I hope my affluent brother will never let that name be di[s]honoured by him." I then bade him good morning, without being reque[s]ted to renew my vi[s]it. I was now [s]o accu[s]tomed to di[s]appointment that I felt not this behaviour of my brother [s]o [s]everely as I [s]hould have done [s]ome few years [s]ince. Indeed, my dear friend, I think my heart grows hard and in[s]en[s]ible, and [s]eems turning into [s]tone, for it is cold and inanimate. I can no longer exult in the happine[s]s, or [s]ympathize in the mi[s]eries of my fellow creatures. The world appears one univer[s]al blank, nay even when I think of you and my Amelia, it [s]till beats but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-617.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] languidly, its emotions are no longer exqui[s]itely plea[s]ant or painful; but like the faint rays of an expiring taper now and then emits a fla[s]h of light that for a moment chears the gloom of a [s]olitary apartment, and after a few [s]truggles is entirely extingui[s]hed. So my heart, which feels a degree of kindly warmth play round it, when I think of your affection, will perhaps a little longer [s]truggle to illumine this frail tenement; then [s]ink to peace in the dark man[s]ion of the grave.--- But why [s]hould I infe[s]t you with my melancholy? I fear I am an ungrateful wretch; for I have found a friend when I lea[s]t expected it, and one who exerts his power to pre[s]erve a life that is no longer of value to me; becau[s]e it is entirely u[s]ele[s]s to [s]ociety. My poor Deborah too, [s]he is [s]till faithful and affectionate. I have [s]till much to be thankful for; but [s]uch is the frailty of human nature, we remember our [s]orrows with a repining mind, while we forget the benefits of which we we are unworthy partakers. I have written this at various opportunities when my time and [s]trength would permit. I [s]hall now di[s]patch it, as you are I am [s]ure ever anxious to hear from me, I will write again [s]oon, and believe, till my heart [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-618.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] is devoid of all [s]en[s]ation, it will ever love you and pray for your happine[s]s. Adieu! MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. Augu[s]t 19 th , 1789. My dear friend, I have once more [s]et down to addre[s]s to you, to tell you I every day draw nearer and nearer the goal, to which we are all ha[s]tening, where I [s]hall again embrace my dear Clementina, and be parted from her no more!---I told you, in my la[s]t, that I had unexpectedly found a friend, who had u[s]ed his utmo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-619.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] endeavours to [s]erve me. It was Mr. Friendly, the gentleman to who[s]e care, my regretted benefactor, Mr. Weldon, [s]o [s]trenuou[s]ly recommended me before he left England. I was one morning at the warehou[s]e, from whence I had employment, when he came in and with him a woman extremely gay in her appearance; but many years younger than him[s]elf. She was what might by many have been called pretty; but to me there appeared nothing in her features that could de[s]erve that name. It was an unmeaning countenance, devoid of [s]en[s]ibility, and if it had any character, it was that of pride and impetuo[s]ity. She purcha[s]ed [s]ome very expen[s]ive articles, for which he [s]topped to pay, and [s]he went off in the chariot, to make, as [s]he [s]aid, [s]ome morning vi[s]its. From what I [s]aw, I feared the good old gentleman had entered the matrimonial pale with a per[s]on no ways qualified to make him happy; and the event proved I was not mi[s]taken in my conjectures. As I was [s]o greatly altered in per[s]on, as not to be recollected by a brother, I could not [s]uppo[s]e Mr. Friendly would know me; but I was mi[s]taken; for as I was [s]peaking to the per[s]on who was giving me out my work, he turned round [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-620.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] hastily and looked at me as though endeavouring to recollect my features. "There are but [s]mall remains of the person," [s]aid he, coming toward me, "but I could almo[s]t [s]wear that was the voice of Mi[s]s Howard." You know, Celia, I have often been remarked for the [s]oftne[s]s of my voice, and I believe many, who would not otherwi[s]e recollect me, know me the moment I [s]peak. I curt[s]yed, acknowledged he was right, and left the [s]hop. I had not proceeded many paces before he overtook me, and offering me his arm, with the solicitude of a father, inquired into my circumstances. He had heard I was well married, but nothing more; my pre[s]ent appearance did not confirm the report; he wi[s]hed to know if he could [s]erve me. Before I could [s]atisfy his laudable curio[s]ity, we had reached the door of the hou[s]e where I lived. "I have an hour to [s]pare, [s]aid he, "may I be admitted, "I cannot leave you till I know how you are [s]ituated. I am perfectly acquainted with the goodne[s]s of your heart; but I know with all your virtues, you have weakne[s][s]es more prejudicial to your intere[s]t and happine[s]s than [s]ome which are called vices. You are credulous; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-621.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] you let a [s]en[s]e of duty [s]ometimes hurry you to actions which are not [s]trictly right. Let me know how you are [s]ituated; tell me your[s]elf what has [s]eperated you from your hu[s]band." Shall I confe[s]s, my dear Celia, [s]hame at the mean apartment I occupied, for a moment crim[s]oned my cheek; and made me he[s]itate to admit him up [s]tairs; but gratitude for the kind [s]olicitude he expre[s][s]ed, a reverential remembrance of the noble spirited Weldon, who[s]e friend he was: conspired to conquer this un[s]ea[s]onable emotion of pride, and I led the way to my little garret, (for [s]uch it literally is.) Deborah looked [s]urpri[s]ed at my introducing a man into an apartment, which con[s]tituted our dining room, drawing room, bed chamber, and kitchen. But when [s]he heard me mention Mr. Weldon, who[s]e name [s]he knew I respected, and who[s]e friends I [s]hould ever con[s]ider as mine, [s]he was perfectly [s]atisfied; and when [s]he found the good old gentleman meant to prove his friend[s]hip to Weldon, by his attention to me, I thought [s]he would have gone wild with joy. She drew a chair clo[s]e to his, nor could all my endeavours to the contrary, prevent her informing him of all [s]he knew, concerning Rook[s]by; and when [s]he mentioned my drawing my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-622.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] subsistence from labour, and my evident ill [s]tate of health; [s]he took his hand and pre[s][s]ed it to her heart; while the tears rolled in big drops down her aged face. I could not [s]ee her emotions unmoved: I aro[s]e from my [s]eat and pretended to look after the dinner, which Deborah, from her friendly anxiety to promote my intere[s]t, had totally neglected; and un[s]een, gave a loo[s]e to [s]en[s]ations which almo[s]t overpowered me. Mr. Friendly would not leave me, till he had prevailed with me to give up my employment, to leave the place I then inhabited, and go to apartments, which he would provide a little way out of town.---"You [s]hall not be obliged," [s]aid he, "for I know that is what would mo[s]t afflict your proud [s]pirit. You think you are humble," (added he with a [s]mile) "but I know you better. You ever was and ever will be very proud: but I like you the better for it. It is the right [s]ort of pride; it is a pride, which [s]hrinks from the weight of obligation which it has not power to return.---Now to obviate that, you have it in your power to oblige me. I have taken a young creature under my protection, (for I am quite a knight errant in the cau[s]e of the ladies,) [s]he is, I believe, a girl of good fortune, and [s]trictly virtuous, but very unfortunate. Now if [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-623.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] you will take her for your companion and teach her, as I know you po[s][s]e[s]s abilities, how to amu[s]e at once her time and enrich her mind, I will [s]upply you with the means. Some other time you may learn how I came to take her under my care. Perhaps, [s]he her[s]elf, when [s]he perceives the gentlene[s]s of your nature, will confide more to you, than from the difference of our [s]ex [s]he po[s][s]ibly could to me. As to the means of your [s]upport, I have [s]ome connections, in the i[s]land of St. John's in America, who [s]end to me for thick cloaks, &c. fit for the climate; now it [s]trikes me that you might make tho[s]e garments, at a good profit for your[s]elf, and yet leave a [s]ufficient for me." When I found, he did not wi[s]h me to receive obligations from him, without [s]ome means to repay them, I was willing to listen to his plan, and in le[s]s than ten days from the time I fir[s]t [s]aw him, I was removed to apartments in I[s]lington, where he [s]ent the young lady to me, whom he had taken under his protection. It was evening when [s]he arrived; I was ill, I was fatigued---had retired to bed and [s]aw her not till the next morning. Oh! Celia, I am very ill now--- my head is giddy---I can proceed no farther [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-624.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] \---perhaps I may never re[s]ume the pen.--- Let me tell you then, while I have power. This lovely girl is---I can no more--- all is dark---and--- It was only a faintne[s]s. I am very [s]ubject to them lately,---I am [s]omething better to-day and will, while Deborah permits me, pur[s]ue my narrative. The young lady intru[s]ted to my care is the per[s]on whom I [s]aw at my brother's; and who, to avoid an union with him, has left his protection for that of a [s]tranger's. She tells me her name is Alton: that [s]he was born in England, but went over to India whil[s]t an infant; that her mother being obliged to go with a lady up into the country left her with a friend, who before her mother's return was forced to retire from the ravages of war: The friend to who[s]e care [s]he was intru[s]ted had no child of her own and at her death left her heire[s]s to a very hand[s]ome fortune; the gentleman, who was executor to the will, and guardian to Mi[s]s Alton intru[s]ted her to the care of my brother that [s]he might be brought home to finish her education. Struck with her per[s]on and the more powerful charms of twenty thou[s]and pounds, he has left no means [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-625.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] untried, by which he could hope to win her affection and draw her into a marriage; but [s]he has ever regarded him, as [s]he [s]ays, with more horror than any other [s]en[s]ations, when [s]he has con[s]idered him as a man de[s]igned to be her hu[s]band. He was extremely kind and attentive to her, and in return, [s]he respected him and would do any thing to promote his happine[s]s, except [s]acrifice her own. She knew [s]o little of the world, that [s]he had actually formed a [s]cheme of working for her bread, and did not even think [s]he could oblige my brother to do her ju[s]tice or place her at a proper [s]chool, and pay the [s]um her guardian allowed both for her education and pocket. She had not confided her real situation to Mr. Friendly, to whom I found chance had introduced her. Poor innocent, in [s]uch a place as London, how [s]oon might [s]he have been decoyed, by [s]eeming friends to ruin and infamy. This faintne[s]s again. I declare I am as weak as a child, every exertion overcomes me.---Deborah will let me write no longer. God ble[s]s you. MERIEL. DEBORAH ELLIS to MISS SHELBURNE. -  Bri[s]tol Oct. 9 th , 1789. MADAM, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-626.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] Since my lady di[s]patched her la[s]t letter to you, [s]he has been daily declining and the faintings [s]he mentioned encrea[s]ed in a mo[s]t alarming manner. Mr. Friendly did every thing in his power to make her comfortable, and the young lady he placed with her was very affectionate and tender; at one time I was in hopes [s]he would recover. But a circum[s]tance happened, that affected her [s]pirits [s]o much as to make the phy[s]icians think it nece[s][s]ary to hurry her to this place for the benefit of the waters. Mr. Friendly generally called on her about twice a week, and though to prevail on my dear lady, to accept a[s][s]i[s]tance from him, he frequently talked and con[s]ulted her about work; yet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-627.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] he never [s]ent any to do, always making someexcuse about its not being ready. He was, however, fond of talking to her and sometimes he would bring the new[s]paper and read to her, and whenever he gave her money [s]aid it was for the board of Mi[s]s Alton. It was one afternoon about [s]ix weeks ago, as he [s]at at tea with the two ladies, a chariot [s]topped at the door, a very fine lady came out of it, and without any ceremony threw open the dining room door, where they were all [s]itting: and flying at my dear lady abu[s]ed her in the gro[s][s]e[s]t manner, accu[s]ed her of being kept by her hu[s]band; for I pre[s]ently found, madam, that this dreadfully pa[s][s]ionate lady was Mrs. Friendly, who had traced her hu[s]band to the place where he [s]o often vi[s]ited, and finding only two women there, [s]he immediately thought one of them mu[s]t be her hu[s]band's mi[s]tre[s]s, and though my poor dear lady was [s]o ill as might, one would have thought, prevented any [s]uch [s]u[s]picion from being believed, yet did [s]he in[s]i[s]t upon it. Mr. Friendly, [s]he [s]aid could maintain her there for no other purpose. She called her every vile name, broke the china and was only withheld by her husband from [s]triking the innocent object of her jealou[s]y, who [s]at as it were [s]tupified with terror, her hands were cla[s]ped and re[s]ted on her knees and her eyes were fixed on the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-628.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] floor; but [s]he [s]poke not one word. Mr. Friendly endeavoured to prevail on his wife to go home; but [s]he was deaf to his entreaties, till he promi[s]ed to accompany her. Ju[s]t as [s]he was going out, [s]he turned round and wi[s]hed my lady might [s]tarve and die in prison, if ever [s]he encouraged her hu[s]band to come there again. "I [s]hould like to [s]ee it," [s]aid [s]he, "and if I [s]aw you dying, I would not give you a farthing to [s]ave you. You have had enough from my poor, credulous, fooli[s]h hu[s]band already and I hope the next bit of bread you eat that is bought with his money will choak you." I do [s]uppo[s]e, madam, [s]he would have gone on much longer, if her hu[s]band had not almost forced her into the carriage, which drove in[s]tantly away. When they were gone, my dear lady rai[s]ed her eyes and cla[s]ped hands to Heaven, "for what new trials am I re[s]erved!" [s]aid [s]he, "Poor Mi[s]s Alton was crying ready to break her heart, and I [s]hould have been very glad to [s]ee my poor mi[s]tre[s]s do the [s]ame: but [s]he did not [s]hed a [s]ingle tear. She looked the very picture of uncomplaining [s]orrow. I was frightened to [s]ee her look [s]o compo[s]ed, and as I feared, her faintings which had kept off for a few days before, now returned with double violence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-629.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] The next day, a gentleman came from Mr. Friendly, [s]aying, that for family reasons, he could not vi[s]it her; but de[s]ired [s]he might want for nothing. This gentleman waited, till the Doctor vi[s]ited my lady, and when he heard his opinion, that Bri[s]tol might be of [s]ervice to her, he de[s]ired me to make in[s]tant preparations for the journey. I chearfully complied, as I found not only the people, who kept the hou[s]e, where we lodged, but even the neighbours, had learned [s]omething of the vi[s]it of Mrs. Friendly, and both my lady and Mi[s]s Alton were considered as bad women. We travelled here by ea[s]y [s]tages, my lady was greatly fatigued, and for many days I did not expect her to live. The place revived in her mind the lo[s]s of her Godmother, who died here about [s]ixteen years ago, when my lady fir[s]t left the convent. The phy[s]icians here, comfort me, by [s]aying, they do not think [s]he is in a confirmed con[s]umption; but that her di[s]order is chiefly on her [s]pirits, and could that depression under which [s]he evidently labours be removed, [s]he might yet recover, and would undoubtedly, in a rapid manner. Though I fear, madam, [s]he will never lo[s]e that depre[s][s]ion; yet I cannot but flatter myself [s]omething may yet turn out to comfort [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-630.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] her. Surely it were a great pity [s]o good a lady [s]hould be cut off in the very flower of her age, and that [s]he, who never wilfully gave pain to any per[s]on, [s]hould be dying of a broken heart. Indeed, madam it almo[s]t breaks my old heart to think of it. She is [s]ome days [s]o well, as to be able to walk to the pump room; but [s]he has herself no idea, that [s]he [s]hall ever leave this place. She is perfectly re[s]igned. She desired me to write to you and to tell you, [s]he thinks [s]he [s]hall never be able to write herself again. She offers you every kind wi[s]h and bids you pray for her everla[s]ting peace. Tho[s]e are her own words. One thing I was de[s]ired not to mention; but I cannot conclude without doing it. I have written twice to Mr. Friendly, [s]ince we have been here: but received no an[s]wer. Our money is almost gone, and [s]hould he for[s]ake us, what will become of my dear lady and poor Mi[s]s Alton, God knows; as for my[s]elf, I am old, and could not hope to live much longer; but for them, they have but ju[s]t entered the world as it were. Pardon me, madam, for writing [s]o much; but I am very unea[s]y and have no one to complain to or advi[s]e with. My lady [s]aid to me yesterday, "Deborah, I think I am better: we will di[s]mi[s]s the phy[s]ician to-morrow."

I wi[s]h to Heaven, Mrs. On[s]low was in England or Mr. Kingly. Oh! madam that my dear ble[s][s]ed lady had been the wife of [s]uch a man as Mr. Kingly, how happy would [s]he have been; and [s]he might have lived years and years, ble[s][s]ing and ble[s][s]ed by all. But now [s]he is broken hearted, for[s]aken by the world and with all her virtues will die unpitied and unlamented by all, except a few, who know how good [s]he is; and among which, none will grieve with more [s]incerity than her and your humble friend and [s]ervant, DEBORAH ELLIS. MERIEL to CELIA. December 22 d , 1789. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-632.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] Strange and in[s]crutable are the ways of Heaven. Once more, my dear Celia, I am permitted to addre[s]s you, and I have a tale of wonder to unfold, which even at this moment, though I am [s]en[s]ible that I live, I breathe, that all around me is reality, yet, my a[s]toni[s]hed [s]en[s]es can hardly, credit!---Celia, the heavie[s]t afflictions may lead to the mo[s]t de[s]irable events. We ought not to complain: every trial, however painful to be borne is inflicted for [s]ome wi[s]e purpo[s]e. Gracious Heaven! when I think, how I have nouri[s]hed one [s]ecret sorrow; how even in my happie[s]t moments have I brooded over it? but it is now removed. That horror, that inexpre[s][s]ible horror, which for [s]o many years has laid upon my mind, is no more. I have been afflicted 'tis true: but I tru[s]t I am now [s]afe at lea[s]t from poverty. My health daily returns, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-633.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] and I can enjoy the heart-felt plea[s]ure of relieving the di[s]tre[s][s]ed. But how, you will [s]ay, how have the[s]e changes taken place? My dear friend, when the tumult of my heart will permit me, I will tell you that I am no longer the friendle[s]s, di[s]tre[s][s]ed creature, I was not long [s]ince. I have a mother living! I have a father too! Ble[s][s]ed! ble[s][s]ed words! and tho[s]e whom I ever considered as my parents were only relations. Mrs. Howard was [s]i[s]ter to my mother.--- But let me tell my tale with [s]ome coherence: for I think my Celia will imagine me wandering from rea[s]on, and that I am writing her the effu[s]ions of a di[s]tempered fancy. While I was at Bri[s]tol, as long as I was able, I went every morning to the pump room. Mi[s]s Alton always accompanied me. I there had [s]everal times an opportunity of [s]eeing and conver[s]ing with Mrs. Harcourt, who was detained there by the ill [s]tate of her hu[s]band's health, who I found was at Bath at the time I fir[s]t [s]aw her, which was the occa[s]ion of her attending the examination of the per[s]ons [s]u[s]pected of robbing her hou[s]e. She frequently made me offers of friend[s]hip, at the [s]ame time entreating my confidence: but my [s]pirits were not at that time, in a [s]tate to permit me to relate the incidents of my life, mo[s]t of which had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-634.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] been [s]o extremely painful, that I endeavoured as much as was in my power to bani[s]h them from my memory. Mr. Friendly, from family rea[s]ons, I imagine was deterred from inquiring for me, after I left London, and the allowance he had made me on account of Mi[s]s Alton's being with me, till he could hear from her friends abroad, entirely cea[s]ed when we had been about a month in Bri[s]tol, [s]o that I became again in very nece[s][s]itous circumstances, which added to my having declined the attendance of the phy[s]ician, and omitted going to drink the waters, on account of my [s]lender finances, encrea[s]ed my di[s]order and I [s]oon was confined to my bed. Mi[s]s Alton is a tender and affectionate girl and would have confined her[s]elf to my bed[s]ide, had I not in[s]i[s]ted, that [s]he [s]hould [s]ometimes walk out. In one of the[s]e walks [s]he met Mrs. Harcourt, who inquired after me.--- The friendly girl expecting every hour to lo[s]e me, bur[s]t into tears at the que[s]tion, described my [s]ituation to Mrs. Harcourt and entreated her to come and [s]ee me. Her own humanity impelled her to comply, and that very afternoon [s]he came to my apartment. She [s]eated her[s]elf by my bed[s]ide, took my hand, and was beginning to [s]peak; when Deborah entered the room with [s]ome toa[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-635.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] and water which [s]he had been down [s]tairs to procure. Mrs. Harcourt [s]tarted. The gla[s]s fell from Deborah's hand; for their eyes met in the [s]ame moment. "Good gracious!" [s]aid Deborah, "am I awake--- are you!---no,---it can't be!---I thought---but 'tis impo[s][s]ible!" Mrs. Harcourt had a little recovered herself. "Yes, Deborah, [s]aid [s]he, "it is possible. I am alive [s]till, though [s]o many years thought dead.---But tell me---I almo[s]t fear to a[s]k---yet tell me, where is my child? Deborah came near. She took my hand and put it into Mrs. Harcourt's, pre[s][s]ed them together, but remained [s]ilent. "Oh! gracious heaven!" [s]he exclaimed, "and is it indeed [s]o?" Then falling on the bed, and throwing her arms round me, [s]he cried, "my child! my darling child! have I found you then, only to lo[s]e you?"---Full of a[s]toni[s]hment and wonder, I could scarcely a[s]k the meaning of what I heard and [s]aw. "How madam," [s]aid I, "can I be your child? Alas! my dear mother has been many years in the [s]ilent grave."---"You have heard her mention a [s]i[s]ter [s]he once had?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-636.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] "Yes, but I always under[s]tood [s]he was dead before I was born."---"Dead to the world I was," [s]he replied, "for many years, and from a few weeks after your birth, my [s]i[s]ter never heard from me. Many vicissitudes have I experienced, far from England, unable to hear from you, and above ten years in captivity. When I again [s]aw my native land and made inquiry for my child and [s]i[s]ter, I was told they were both dead: Nor did I ever think to have been [s]o ble[s]t as this; but I mu[s]t inquire my beloved Meriel, when you are able to an[s]wer me. I mu[s]t know how you have been [s]o long hid from me, and why it was reported you were dead. Are my brother and [s]i[s]ter Howard both dead?"--- She might have proceeded in her questions uninterrupted; for a[s]toni[s]hment had deprived me of the power of [s]peech. Yet perfectly conceiving in a moment the extreme felicity of having a mother! a mother who loved me, my heart al[s]o felt lightened of a load of angui[s]h. He, who had attempted my [s]eduction was not my father; he was no relation, only by marriage. Celia, my beloved Celia, cannot you perfectly comprehend the rapture that thought conveyed to my [s]oul. Oh! my friend---I am certain, it is utterly impo[s][s]ible: for you are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-637.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] unacquainted with guilt. The very idea of it in[s]pires you with horror; then, what mu[s]t have been my feelings on the reflection, that I had kindled a guilty pa[s][s]ion, from which nature [s]hrinks back agha[s]t!---But human nature, with all its frailties, could never [s]ink into [s]uch depravity.---Unable to articulate a [s]ingle word, I threw my arms round her neck and overpowered by the plea[s]ing [s]en[s]ations that ru[s]hed over my heart, I [s]unk into in[s]en[s]ibility. How long I remained [s]o, I cannot even conjecture; but when I recovered, I [s]eemed as though awaking from a deep [s]leep, and was full of the idea of a delightful dream.---How charmingly was that dream realized, when putting back the curtain I [s]aw my mother! my kind affectionate mother, [s]itting by my bed[s]ide.---"How are you, my child," [s]aid [s]he, in an accent of the [s]ofte[s]t maternal kindne[s]s. I was extremely faint, and could [s]carcely an[s]wer, but yet I felt better and I told her [s]o. From that hour I began to amend, and was in the cour[s]e of a few days able to be removed to my mother's hou[s]e, where I was introduced to my father. Oh! ble[s][s]ed thought, that I [s]hould live to [s]ay I have a father!---a noble! honourable! father!--- who[s]e every action of his life, is an eulogium [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-638.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] on the goodne[s]s of his heart; reflects a credit on the nation of which he is a native, and the religion of which he is not only a profe[s][s]or, but a [s]trict follower of its precepts. When I was taken from the lodgings which I then occupied, to my dear mother's hou[s]e, a new [s]ource of a[s]toni[s]hment presented it[s]elf. My mother had a per[s]on with her, whom I had often heard her mention as an e[s]teemed friend and companion. The day after I was [s]ettled in her family, I was introduced to this lady and di[s]covered in her, tho' greatly altered the per[s]on of Mrs. Talbot, whom you may remember Mr. Howard kept in a very unbecoming manner, even in the hou[s]e with his wife, my dear, though [s]o rigid aunt. She went abroad with a lady, who was following a hu[s]band, whom [s]he loved, and who, from nece[s][s]ity, being an officer in the army, had been [s]eparated from her. When Mrs. Talbot left Woodbine-cott, [s]he did not know her own [s]ituation; but about [s]ix months after, [s]he became the mother of a girl. This girl [s]he left in the care of a Mrs. Alton, while [s]he her[s]elf accompanied her lady up the country in [s]earch of her hu[s]band. A variety of incidents, unnece[s][s]ary here to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-639.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] relate, detained them [s]everal years from the place where [s]he left her child. On her return, neither friend nor child were to be found. Celia, do you not already know that this child is the very Mi[s]s Alton, whom my brother, as I have been accu[s]tomed to call him, would have married. My [s]oul [s]hudders, when I think of the e[s]cape he has had. This Mi[s]s Alton, is his [s]i[s]ter, the natural daughter of his father. Good Heavens! to what [s]ins are mortals led, as it were blindfold; by the vices of their parents. The meeting between the mother and the daughter was very affecting. Mrs. Talbot has retained tho[s]e good re[s]olutions, with which [s]he has been plea[s]ed to [s]ay I fir[s]t in[s]pired her. She lo[s]t the friend whom [s]he accompanied to India, when [s]he had been there about [s]ix years, and was [s]oon after recommended to the notice of that excellent woman, whom I have now the honour to call mother! with whom [s]he has continued ever [s]ince, as a companion, a friend, and the [s]uperintendent of her family. When I am more compo[s]ed, and my [s]trength will better permit me, I will give you a few particulars of the life of this dear, this new found parent; but at pre[s]ent, I am not permitted to devote above an hour out of the four and twenty to writing, and this letter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-640.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] has been the fruit of [s]everal efforts. I am called away.---Adieu! Your's while I live. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. January 15 th , 1790. In my la[s]t, I promi[s]ed a few of the particulars of my mother's life, and I will now give them without further preface. She was [s]everal years younger than Mrs. Howard; and when her [s]i[s]ter was married, was [s]till at [s]chool. At the early age of [s]ixteen, [s]he became acquainted with Mr. Harcourt, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-641.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] only [s]on of a wealthy Ea[s]t-India merchant, with whom [s]he entered into the mo[s]t [s]acred bonds before any part of either family even [s]u[s]pected there was an intimacy [s]ub[s]i[s]ting between them. Her father died [s]oon after this union had taken place, died uninformed of it---and her mother followed him before [s]he had an opportunity to di[s]clo[s]e the [s]ecret of her [s]ituation: for Mr. Harcourt dreaded the anger of his family, [s]hould they di[s]cover that he had married a woman with [s]o [s]mall a fortune as two thou[s]and pounds. My aunt Howard, whom I [s]o long considered as my parent, was then [s]ettled, and was the only friend my mother had, to whom [s]he dared impart her marriage, and to this di[s]clo[s]ure [s]he was driven by nece[s][s]ity; for [s]he found her[s]elf likely to become a mother. Mr. Howard was at that time on a vi[s]it to a friend [s]ome hundred miles from Woodbine cott, and my aunt offered her [s]i[s]ter an a[s]ylum, there, till [s]he [s]hould be relea[s]ed from her burthen. It was there I was born, and on the very day of my birth intru[s]ted to the care of the faithful Deborah, who had been brought up by my grandmother and married from her hou[s]e. She [s]olemnly vowed never to divulge the [s]ecret of my birth; and when three weeks after, my aunt Howard was delivered of a child, who expired in a few days, it was determined that [s]he [s]hould adopt [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-642.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] me and ever take care of me as her own, till it [s]hould be in the power of my parents to claim and acknowledge me.---Deborah alone, was privy to the impo[s]ture, and worthy has [s]he proved her[s]elf of the confidence placed in her. My father's friends having cau[s]e to [s]u[s]pect he had formed [s]ome attachment, which did not altogether coincide with the plans they had formed for his future e[s]tabli[s]hment in life, had [s]ent him off on a commercial plan to Bengal, whil[s]t my mother was lying in. Di[s]tracted by this intelligence, as [s]oon as her [s]trength permitted, [s]he re[s]olved to follow him; and leaving me in the care of Mrs. Howard, [s]he embarked for India; but on her arrival at Bengal learnt that her hu[s]band had executed his commi[s][s]ions at that place, and was gone with [s]ome Engli[s]h factors up the country: impelled by a pure and ardent affection, [s]he followed the route he had taken, but in vain. War began to advance with horrid [s]trides, followed by deva[s]tation and famine, and whil[s]t [s]earching for her husband, my mother fell into the hands of the enemy. Lovely in her per[s]on, ornamented with all the charms of youth, [s]he was considered as a valuable prize among the captives, and was [s]old to a merchant, who purchased [s]laves for the Grand Segnior. By long and tire[s]ome journies [s]he reached [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-643.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] Constantinople and was pre[s]ented to the royal Turk, but fortunately her per[s]on did not plea[s]e him, and [s]he was only purcha[s]ed, merely to fill up the number of his wives; without once receiving a vi[s]it from him, or being [s]olicited to entertain him in an improper manner. Ten years was [s]he detained in this place, where [s]he [s]ays her time would have pa[s]t plea[s]antly enough, had it not been for the remembrance of my father and myself; but the thought of what might have become of us, prevented her being happy or receiving the lea[s]t [s]atisfaction from the various [s]cenes of luxury and amu[s]ement that daily [s]urrounded her. In the [s]ummer season, the Grand Segnior [s]ent his wives and all the female part of his family in large parties to the different hou[s]es he had in the country: and in one of the[s]e excur[s]ions my mother was [s]truck with the appearance of a [s]lave, who u[s]ed to walk on a terrace before the windows of the apartments appointed for the women, apparently in a very ill [s]tate of health. In the party of woman of which my mother made one was a beautiful turk, who was [s]i[s]ter to the Grand Signior, her name was Zayde. She had ever [s]hewn a visible partiality to my mother, and cultivated her friend[s]hip with the utmo[s]t care. She endeavoured to attain from her in[s]tructions [s]ome knowledge of the Engli[s]h language, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-644.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] and li[s]tened with attention, when [s]he [s]trove to in[s]truct her in the precepts of the Christian religion. This young prince[s]s perceiving one day, that my mother regarded the [s]ick [s]lave with fixed attention, took an opportunity to tell her, the [s]lave was hers, that he was a favourite, and had made an impre[s][s]ion on her heart. "I love him," [s]aid [s]he, "but I have never told him [s]o. I only endeavour to make his [s]ervitude le[s]s painful by [s]hewing him every kindne[s]s in my power; but whenever I tell him I am [s]orry to [s]ee him [s]o unhappy, and wi[s]h I could remove the cau[s]e of his affliction, he an[s]wers, that his sorrows can never be le[s]s, till he is re[s]tored to liberty and the love of a beautiful Chri[s]tian, who alone can render either life or liberty de[s]irable." "Thus much," continued [s]he, I can under[s]tand; but as I cannot fully comprehend his meaning, I wi[s]h you would [s]ee and talk to him [s]ome evening, when, if you can learn from him, what will be mo[s]t conducive to his happine[s]s, I will exert my utmo[s]t power to procure it for him."---My mother complied with the request of Zayde, and one evening in the middle of July [s]he accompanied her into the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-645.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] garden to give the Chri[s]tian [s]lave the promi[s]ed meeting. The moon was at the full---but the atmosphere was cloudy, and though it was possible to di[s]tingui[s]h objects, yet the light was not [s]ufficient to permit a di[s]crimination of features. She addre[s][s]ed the [s]lave in Engli[s]h, told him how much Zayde was intere[s]ted in his behalf, and begged to learn from him, what could be done to comfort his mind, and a[s][s]i[s]t in the re[s]toration of his health. "I might [s]ay," replied the [s]lave, "that liberty would re[s]tore me to all I [s]o feelingly regret---but, alas! lady, I have lo[s]t what it is not (I greatly fear) in the power of fate to re[s]tore.---Married in early youth to a lovely woman, who, to the charms of an engaging per[s]on, added all the fascinating beauties of a pure and elevated mind, and [s]eparated from her in the very moment when the delicacy of her [s]ituation mo[s]t required a hu[s]band's tenderne[s]s and fond solicitude, think what I mu[s]t [s]uffer from an ab[s]ence of eleven years, without having once heard whether either her[s]elf or child are living. Sent from England by the cruel, pretended tenderne[s]s of parents, who valued wealth [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-646.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] above every other earthly con[s]ideration--- thrown by the chance of war into a [s]lavery, from whence I can never hope to e[s]cape; I am, I feel am, lo[s]t to the world and dead to every thing but a remembrance of what I have been and what I now am." "Alas! it is very [s]ad," replied my mother, bending forward to wipe off the tears [s]he felt trickling from her eyes. Ju[s]t then the moon broke from the cloud that had ob[s]cured her brightne[s]s and [s]hed her beams full on the face of the per[s]on with whom [s]he was conver[s]ing. A [s]cream of mingled [s]urpri[s]e and joy e[s]caped her.--- It was her hu[s]band, who under the [s]ame ma[s]ter, for the [s]ame term of years had endured [s]lavery, and yet no lucky chance had ever brought them together. Nay, even when [s]he had ob[s]erved him on the terrace, his vi[s]age was ever bent toward the earth, and his hat pulled over his eyes, and [s]he had no opportunity to di[s]cover features, which however altered by [s]ickne[s]s and sorrow were [s]till fre[s]h in her memory, [s]till dear to her heart. They candidly revealed their [s]ituation to the generous Zayde, who was indefatigable till [s]he had contrived the means for their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-647.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] efcape.---"And will not you accompany us," [s]aid my mother, when [s]he informed her of the plan [s]he had laid, and gave into their hands the means of putting it in execution. "No," [s]he replied, "you my dear friend have taught me the foundation of the Christian religion; it teaches us to compa[s][s]ionate and relieve the di[s]tre[s][s]es of our fellow creatures; but it al[s]o teaches us never to for[s]ake our parents. I have a mother living, who is old. She [s]ays, I am her only comfort.--- It will be wrong to leave her, to deprive her of what con[s]titutes her whole felicity. Go then, my friends, embrace this opportunity of emancipating your[s]elves from [s]lavery: leave me to the performance of my duty: and pray for me, that though I do not, perhaps, pur[s]ue the right Chri[s]tian mode of wor[s]hip, yet, that the offerings of a [s]incere and grateful heart may be accepted at the throne of mercy."--- With eyes and hearts overflowing with gratitude and affection did my parents take leave of this fair benevolent Mahometan; but though they regained their liberty, various incidents prevented their return to England, till within the[s]e four years la[s]t pa[s]t. They had frequently written to inquire after [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-648.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] me; but never received any an[s]wer; and when they arrived were informed from many people that all Mr. Howard's family were dead, except the [s]on, who was abroad.--- Mr. Harcourt found that his own family, except [s]ome di[s]tant branches, were entirely extinct, and that a large fortune waited only his appearance and proper claim. This he is now ma[s]ter of, and to this I am now the acknowledged heire[s]s. Care[s][s]ed by my parents, re[s]pected once more by the world, who now again behold me [s]urrounded by affluence, my health and [s]pirits daily returning, what have I more to wi[s]h for?--- Alas! Celia, we are never content, and I mo[s]t ardently de[s]ire my poor Rook[s]by's reformation to complete my felicity.---Kingly too, I could wi[s]h to hear that he was well and happy. But I will offer the [s]acrifice of thank[s]giving for the ble[s][s]ings I have received, and for futurity tru[s]t entirely to a wi[s]e and bountiful Providence, who has never yet for[s]aken me, and who I humbly hope never will. I have been once to [s]ee Kingly's children; my mother went with me: they are both well. Clara's children are at the [s]ame [s]chool and enjoy the [s]ame advantages.

My dear Celia, pray for me, that I may [s]upport this unexpected, this wonderful elevation of fortune as I ought, that while I [s]hare the plea[s]ures of affluence I may never forget the pangs of poverty or turn a deaf ear to the cry of affliction. Adieu! MERIEL. FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW. April 16 th , 1790. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-650.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] I am returned to England once more; for my mind was [s]o hara[s][s]ed by the thoughts of what might be the fate of my beloved Meriel, that my health declined, and I was advi[s]ed to [s]olicit an exchange and return to my native place; where the air might restore me. I complied with the advice of my friends, not from any opinion of my own that I was in danger, for the complaints of the mind are [s]o far [s]uperior to tho[s]e of the body, that I was not [s]en[s]ible of my own declining [s]tate. Meriel, in affliction, without friends, without [s]upport, continually haunted my imagination. On my arrival in England, I went immediately to my agent. He had heard no tidings of her. His heart was not intere[s]ted; he had therefore made only a few inquiries [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-651.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] and finding them fruitle[s]s, had given up the [s]earch.---I determined to remain a few days in London to re[s]t after the fatigues of my voyage and then vi[s]it my dear boys.---My time hung heavy on my hands and I sauntered into a coffee hou[s]e towards the clo[s]e of evening. A brother officer acco[s]ted me; we chatted a few moments on indifferent [s]ubjects, and he propo[s]ed going to the play. I accompanied him ju[s]t to while away the time, rather than from any hope of amu[s]ement. Ju[s]t before the curtain ro[s]e, an elderly gentleman entered the box opposite to that in which I was [s]itting, leading a lady, whom at the fir[s]t glance, I knew to be my adored, my lovely Meriel. Health again adorned her countenance and [s]parkled in her eyes; yet there was impressed on her features a [s]ort of pen[s]ive [s]hade, which [s]eemed to [s]ay, [s]he might be happier. Her dre[s]s though, [s]weetly simple, and becoming, yet be[s]poke the wearer in affluent circum[s]tances, and the a[s][s]idious attention of the gentleman, who accompanied her, was evidently the effu[s]ions of tenderne[s]s. She received them with complacency; nay, returned them with looks beaming expre[s][s]ive affection. A young man in the box with me ob[s]erved the emotions in my counteance, whil[s]t I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-652.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] regarded her.---"Do you know that lady," [s]aid he,---"I think I do [s]ir, I have [s]ome idea that her name is Rook[s]by."--- "I don't know her name," [s]aid he, "but [s]he is a damn'd pretty creature, and that old fellow de[s]erves to be gibbetted for monopolizing her."--- A chill of horror ran through my heart; can Meriel Howard, [s]aid I, mentally, be [s]unk from that eminence of virtue, which ever di[s]tingui[s]hed her, into [s]o low, [s]o pitiable a character, as to exi[s]t on the wages of pro[s]titution? "Does [s]he live with that gentleman?" [s]aid I, to my intelligencer. "'Tis thought [s]o," he replied, "[s]he is quite a new face. I have [s]een her often in public with him, and [s]he [s]eldom is accompanied by any one but an old woman, who looks like a convenient." "And is that all the rea[s]on you can give" [s]aid I fiercely, "for injuring the character of a woman that ever was, and I tru[s]t ever will be free from blemi[s]h." Oh! no," [s]aid he, "when I fir[s]t [s]aw her, it was at the opera; and I was told [s]he was a woman of that [s]tamp; for [s]he left her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-653.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] husband about a year and a half ago and lived with a young officer of the name of Kingly." I was going to an[s]wer with great warmth and inquire the name of the per[s]on, who had thus dared to [s]port with my character; but my friend interpo[s]ed and obliged me to quit the play-hou[s]e without any farther information. This tran[s]ient glance of my dear Meriel, added to the villainous a[s][s]ertions of the impertinent coxcomb, who vilified her name, had [s]uch an effect on my [s]pirits, that re[s]t was a [s]tranger to my eyes. I had not inquired the name of the gentleman with whom I [s]aw her: it was therefore impo[s][s]ible to trace her out. For many evenings I frequented the theatres, the opera-hou[s]e---every place of public amu[s]ement; but was [s]till unsuccessful. She was not at any, or if there, was effectually concealed from me.---Unhappy, ill, di[s]gu[s]ted with every object that [s]urrounded me, I determined one morning to vi[s]it my children, who I had previou[s]ly heard, were well, and endeavour to lo[s]e my chagrin in their innocent care[s][s]es. The [s]chool they were at is about twenty-five miles from town. I took a po[s]t chai[s]e and arrived at the place about eleven o'clock. An elegant carriage [s]tood at the gate, which drew off to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-654.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] give me room to alight. I a[s]ked the [s]ervant who opened the gate, for my boys. "They are in the parlour," [s]aid he; I followed him, in fancy anticipating their dear embraces. He threw open the parlour door. I advanced and [s]aw, [s]eated at the upper end of the room, [s]urrounded by the four boys, (for Clara's children are there) di[s]tributing to them, toys and fruit, the intere[s]ting figure of Mrs. Rook[s]by. A[s]toni[s]hment riveted me to the floor. She looked toward me; joy fla[s]hed from her eyes. An exclamation of [s]urpri[s]e e[s]caped her, and before either of us had time for reflection, I found I had [s]eated my[s]elf be[s]ide her and cla[s]ped her in my arms, while the dear children were climbing round, each [s]triving to be the fir[s]t to [s]hare my caresses. However joy had for a moment made her forget her[s]elf, [s]he [s]oon recovered her usual air of cautious timidity and di[s]ingaging herself from my embrace, [s]he pre[s]ented me to an elderly lady, whom till then I had not observed; and whom [s]he addre[s][s]ed by the endearing title of mother. They propo[s]ed taking the children home with them and di[s]mi[s][s]ing my chai[s]e to take a [s]eat in their coach and all return to town together.--- During our ride, [s]he unfolded to me a tale of wonder, unnece[s][s]ary here to repeat; because [s]he informed me [s]he has written your Amelia a full account of it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-655.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] I am a frequent vi[s]itor at Mr. Harcourt's and enjoy her [s]ociety undi[s]turbed by the fears of the world's cen[s]ure; for under the [s]helter of paternal protection, who [s]hall dare to arraign her conduct? She informs me [s]he has not heard from her hu[s]band, [s]ince his relea[s]e from the King's bench: but imagines he is wandering abroad with the wild Clara. You will hardly believe it po[s][s]ible, that young Howard, who refu[s]ed to a[s][s]i[s]t or even acknowledge the dear Meriel, when [s]he was in di[s]tre[s]s and he thought her his [s]i[s]ter, has been to pay his re[s]pects to her [s]ince he has di[s]covered [s]he is a wealthy relative. She received him politely; but did not a[s]k him to repeat his vi[s]it. He is affluent," [s]aid [s]he, "he does not want assistance, and I do not wi[s]h to be pe[s]tered with his company." Far different was her conduct to He[s]ter Mo[s][s]op, who is now a widow with three children and in very indigent circumstances. She met Mrs. Mo[s][s]op by accident at a perfumer's [s]hop, and judging from her appearance that [s]he was no longer the wealthy, haughty woman, who had never known distress, acco[s]ted her in a manner, that encouraged her to make her a vi[s]it; nay, [s]he entreated her to do [s]o. From her [s]he learned He[s]ter's nece[s][s]ities, and he[s]itated not a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-656.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] moment to exert her benevolence to remove them. She inquired after Su[s]an. Tears were the only an[s]wer [s]he received.---Alas! poor Su[s]an! [s]educed by Belger, led into all manner of folly by Clara, [s]he fell from one degree of vice to another, till oppre[s][s]ed by the complicated evils of infamy, di[s]ea[s]e and a broken heart, [s]he [s]unk into an untimely grave, in her la[s]t hours in want of the common nece[s][s]aries of life. Meriel gave a tear to her memory and to [s]ooth the affliction of the mother immediately formed a plan for He[s]ter's [s]upport. She advanced money for her to take a [s]hop furni[s]hed well with haberdashery and ho[s]iery; and by the many recommendations of Mrs. Harcourt, [s]he is likely to gain a very decent [s]ub[s]i[s]tence. Young Mo[s][s]op is married to a rich heire[s]s; but they live in [s]ome town very di[s]tant from London, and he found it quite inconvenient to write and inquire after his mother and [s]i[s]ters. I hope, now, we [s]hall [s]oon [s]ee you in England: I feel uncommonly happy, and I wi[s]h you to [s]ee and [s]hare my happine[s]s.--- Methinks, the wheel of fortune has gone its round: and we who have been thrown to the very bottom, are now beginning to ri[s]e. I [s]ee my dear Meriel enjoying all the comforts, all the elegances of life---care[s][s]ed, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-657.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] beloved, e[s]teemed by all, and I cannot help indulging the flattering hope, (call it not chimerical) that I [s]hall one day call her mine! Oh! On[s]low---when that ble[s]t hour arrives! (if [s]uch an hour Heaven has in [s]tore for me) when I [s]hall [s]ee the affection of her faithful heart beam from her expressive eyes, unchecked by fear, I [s]hall think my[s]elf at the very [s]ummit of human felicity! My kinde[s]t remembrances and be[s]t wi[s]hes attend your Amelia. Ever your's, F. KINGLY. P. S. Previous to Mrs. Rook[s]by's assisting He[s]ter, the poor creature made the humiliating confe[s][s]ion, that it was her artifices, to which [s]he was in[s]tigated by her mother, that fir[s]t [s]eparated me from my beloved Meriel; but that noble minded woman frankly forgave her; never witheld her friendship from her, and has never once [s]ince mentioned the circum[s]tance. MRS. ONSLOW to MISS SHELBURNE. November 10 th , 1790. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-658.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] You will perhaps be [s]urprized, my dear madam, to receive a letter from a per[s]on to whom you are a [s]tranger; but though I never was honoured with the acquaintance of Mi[s]s Shelburne, yet [s]he has no doubt heard of Amelia Sidney, who has been [s]o highly honoured by the friend[s]hip of our equally beloved Mrs Rook[s]by.--- That lady from a variety of incidents has been prevented from writing to you for [s]everal months pa[s]t; and I am now de[s]ired by her to inform you that [s]he is in health; but totally inadequate to the ta[s]k of relating to you the [s]cenes in which [s]he has been lately engaged.---I know her motive for thus declining a ta[s]k which [s]he ever con[s]idered plea[s]urable, that of writing to her e[s]teemed Celia is delicacy: [s]he cannot inform you of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-659.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] what has lately occurred, without making mention of her own magnanimity. Her fortitude has ever been con[s]picuous, it has [s]u[s]tained her under [s]ome of the heavie[s]t trials to which the human heart is incident; but in this la[s]t [s]he has ri[s]en almo[s]t above humanity. Pardon the expre[s][s]ion; for I am fully [s]en[s]ible how much the human heart is capable of, it is tempered by a great, an all wi[s]e Being, who will never inflict trials beyond our power to [s]upport;---but we daily [s]ee [s]uch in[s]tances of depravity that we look with a kind of wonder on tho[s]e who through life maintain that dignified conduct, that purity of manner and univer[s]al benevolence which is the true characteri[s]tic of Christianity.--- But I intrude on your patience, and defer the intere[s]ting narrative. To proceed then. On my arrival in England after an ab[s]ence of [s]ix years I was both [s]urprized and plea[s]ed to [s]ee the alteration which had taken place in the circum[s]tanes of our friend. She had regained all that [s]oftne[s]s, that delicacy of countenance, for which [s]he has been universally admired; but which [s]ickne[s]s and sorrow had when I left her faded into langour. She was chearful and apparently happy; but [s]till [s]ome hours of painful reflection would intrude; for [s]he was totally ignorant [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-660.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] of the fate of her hu[s]band. He might return to England, he might demand her from her father and mother, when he found her the affluent heire[s]s of a large fortune.--- The[s]e ideas continually haunted her, and [s]ometimes interrupted her mo[s]t chearful hours. Mrs. Harcourt had invited me to [s]pend a few weeks with them at a [s]eat of their's [s]ituated on the banks of the Thames, near Wind[s]or. I accepted the invitation, and had been there near three weeks, when Mrs. Rook[s]by entered my appartment one morning, pale and ready to [s]aint. She could not [s]peak, but put a note into my hands, which [s]he had ju[s]t received. It was from Clara---and in a few incoherent lines, repre[s]ented Rook[s]by in a mo[s]t wretched situation, dying and in the utmo[s]t di[s]tre[s]s.--- I had known [s]o many in[s]tances of Clara's art, that I endeavoured to per[s]uade Mrs. Rook[s]by from the re[s]olution, [s]he had formed of going immediately to town and administering relief to her hu[s]band: but all I could [s]ay, joined to the united entreaties of her parents, could not prevail, and all I could do was to accompany her. She ordered the coachman to [s]et her down according to the direction contained in Clara's billet. It was at a mean hou[s]e in an ob[s]cure [s]treet in We[s]tmin[s]ter. We enquired for her hu[s]band by the name of Moreton, and was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-661.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] [s]hewn up two pair of [s]tairs into a [s]mall back room, where on a bed without hangings, lay all that remained of the once elegant affluent Rook[s]by, worn to a [s]keleton, and in the very la[s]t [s]tage of a decline, (for he had never recovered the effects of the wound) and riot and intemperance had ha[s]tened the period of his exi[s]tence.---Be[s]ide the bed, ([s]upporting his head on her arm, the tears flowing from her eyes) [s]at Clara: but I could never have conceived it to be the lovely Clara, who had [s]tolen the heart of Rooksby from our dear friend, for her appearance was [s]quallid and mi[s]erable. Sunk eyes, pale cheeks, every indication of disease and poverty was marked upon her person.--- She turned her eyes towards us as we entered, but without changing her attitude. She has very fine eyes and in [s]pite of their languor [s]till retained [s]ufficient expre[s][s]ion, to inform us, that [s]he was equally oppre[s][s]ed by the [s]ituation of the poor [s]ufferer on the bed, and [s]hame at appearing in the presence of the woman [s]he had injured beyond reparation. Our excellent Meriel advanced, (checking the powerful feelings of her heart) and as with one hand, [s]he took one of her dying hu[s]band's, [s]he extended the other towards Clara: and in accents [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-662.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] scarcely audible, bade her be comforted. Struck by [s]uch an uncommon proof of benevolence, the poor [s]uffering criminal [s]unk on her knees. She cla[s]ped the hand extended towards her, rai[s]ed her [s]treaming eyes;--- but could not give vent to the fullne[s]s of her heart by words. "Go," cried our magnanimous Meriel, "go, my poor penitent Clara, and compo[s]e your[s]elf: I will [s]tay and attend my husband:" then turning to me, [s]he continued, "Shall I entreat you Amelia to return and inform my parents that you have left me in the performance of my duty: that you have left me attending the [s]ick bed of a hu[s]band, who rai[s]ed me from ob[s]curity to an elevated fortune: tell them, I remember not his errors--- they were the children of human nature:---but his benevolence will never be obliterated from my mind.---That was the offspring of Heaven.---As [s]he [s]poke, [s]he waved her hand; I found it was impo[s][s]ible to di[s]obey her, and retired from the apartment---but not from the hou[s]e. I di[s]patched a [s]hort note to Mrs. Harcourt and then exerted my[s]elf to obtain for Rook[s]by, and my dear rigidly duteous friend, every a[s][s]i[s]tance which money could procure.---It is a [s]ad thing to acknowledge, but [s]o it was, tho[s]e very people who had [s]uffered Rook[s]by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-663.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] and Clara to want even the means to [s]upport exi[s]tence, whil[s]t they thought them de[s]titute of friends and money, no [s]ooner [s]aw them vi[s]ited by per[s]ons, who were [s]uppo[s]ed wealthy, and beheld the contents of my pur[s]e, which fortunately was amply [s]upplied, than they were ready to run! to fly! to perform any dirty, or painful work for which they expected to be well paid. But I mean not to make human nature de[s]picable by this ob[s]ervation. The[s]e people were poor.---And God knows we may all yield to temptations, when poverty is the [s]trong incentive. I heard from my friend every hour, though [s]he her[s]elf imagined I was returned to her father and mother. About midnight I heard an extraordinary bu[s]tle up [s]tairs, and on inquiring the cau[s]e, found that Rook[s]by who had never been able to [s]peak to his angelic wife more than mono[s]ylables, [s]ince her arrival, had been [s]eized with a kind of fit, and was expected every moment to expire. I thought it improper for Mrs. Rooksby to be left in [s]uch a [s]ituation to the entire care of [s]trangers, and therefore [s]ent up word that I was returned from the country with a me[s][s]age from her mother, and if [s]he plea[s]ed would come up. She [s]aid, [s]he would be happy to [s]ee me. When I went into the room I found her [s]eated on the bed, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-664.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] supporting her dying hu[s]band, who was at that time ea[s]y and [s]eemingly dozing. His right arm was encircling her wai[s]t, his head re[s]ted on her bo[s]om, [s]he pointed to a chair by the bed[s]ide, but did not [s]peak. On the oppo[s]ite [s]ide of the bed, [s]tood a woman with volatiles which they had been applying to the no[s]e and temples of the expiring man; and at the foot was Clara on her knees her eyes elevated, her hands, cla[s]ped, and her whole countenance bearing te[s]timony to the angui[s]h that rent her [s]oul. In my life, I never [s]aw a more intere[s]ting [s]cene, nor never I hope [s]hall I witne[s]s [s]uch another.---I [s]at down in [s]ilence, and in a few moments the Physician, whom Mrs. Rook[s]by had [s]ent for arrived. He pronounced the patient pa[s]t all hope, and a few hours confirmed the [s]entence. It was near [s]even o'clock, when [s]tarting as it were from [s]leep, he gazed ardently on his wife. "Oh Meriel," [s]aid he, "I dreamt I was in the realms of bli[s]s and you conducted me there. Ble[s][s]ed woman, if you forgive me, if you pray for my enterance into that place of eternal peace; I [s]hall, I know I [s]hall, be received.---"Oh!" [s]aid [s]he, with fervour, "May Heaven [s]o forgive my offences as I pardon every offence of yours toward me.---"But Clara," cried he, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-665.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] "poor guilty Clara!"---"I will be her friend," replied Mrs. Rook[s]by. "Enough," [s]aid he, "may every ble[s][s]ing crown you here, and everla[s]ting joys"---He could not fini[s]h the [s]entence, but remained [s]ilent and almo[s]t inanimate for the [s]pace of half an hour. He then moved and took a cordial which [s]he offered him. I prevailed on her to quit her painful [s]ituation at the head of the bed and let him lye down. She did [s]o, but he [s]till retained her hand.---Ju[s]t before the final [s]cene clo[s]ed, he rai[s]ed himself a little, and looking earne[s]tly in her face---"My children," he cried, "my dear boys."---"Are they not mine," [s]he replied in an accent to which no words can do ju[s]tice. "Oh! what a wretch I have been!!!"--- [s]aid he.---His head [s]unk on her [s]houlder, he endeavoured to throw his arms around her, but Death had arre[s]ted their power.--- He groaned---[s]truggled for the power of utterance---and in that [s]truggle expired. I knew the extreme [s]en[s]ibility of the heart with which I had to deal. I attempted not to con[s]ole her, I rather encouraged her to give a loo[s]e to her feelings, and in a few hours [s]he became [s]ufficiently composed to [s]ubmit to my direction, and [s]uffer herself to be conveyed to her father and mother: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-666.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] but not 'till [s]he had given proper directions for the future [s]upport of Clara. This unhappy woman confe[s][s]ed in the angui[s]h of her heart, that at the very moment when our incomparable friend gave her a[s][s]i[s]tance and countenance in Devon[s]hire, [s]he was ploting her ruin, that the chief part of the letter [s]he wrote to her, and of which you have had a copy was the invention of her own brain, and that from a very child [s]he has been the offspring of folly.--- Mrs. Rook[s]by heard her confe[s][s]ion without any emotion, [s]ave that of compa[s][s]ion, and when [s]he had fini[s]hed, bade her not de[s]pair but re[s]olve on a new cour[s]e of life, and tru[s]t in that bounteous Creator for pardon, who never turned from the truly penitent.--- She has [s]ent this unfortunate and I may [s]ay guilty woman into Wales, were [s]he has become re[s]pon[s]ible for her board, and allows her ten pounds a year for her pocket and extra expences. The children [s]he has taken entirely under her own care. My dear Mi[s]s Shelburne, I cannot help now indulging the mo[s]t [s]anguine hopes, that I [s]hall [s]ee this worthy woman rewarded for all her [s]ufferings; [s]hall [s]ee her [s]oon united to the man to whom for many years [s]he has been [s]incerely attached, and from whom only the mo[s]t cruel treachery could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-667.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] have [s]eparated her;---for He[s]ter Mo[s][s]op has confe[s][s]ed that [s]he was the author of tho[s]e letters which prevented her union with Rainsforth. We do not let Mr. Harcourt know that He[s]ter has made this confe[s][s]ion, for he would never forgive her, and I much fear would in[s]i[s]t on Mrs. Rook[s]by's with-drawing her friend[s]hip entirely from her. Mrs. Rook[s]by bid me [s]ay [s]he will write as [s]oon as [s]he is able, and in the mean time de[s]ires you will believe [s]he can never be otherwi[s]e than your friend, and in the [s]ame rank begs leave to be placed, Your obliged AMELIA ONSLOW. MERIEL to CELIA. [4] Sept. 29 th , 1791. I have foreborn to write; becau[s]e I knew my dear Amelia had informed you of every material occurrence. I knew [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-668.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] [s]he had told you that I had promi[s]ed after my year of mourning was expired, to give my hand to the man, who fir[s]t po[s][s]e[s][s]ed my heart. That year was ended on this very day, and I am now the wife of Kingly. I could almo[s]t find it in my heart to renounce the name and [s]ay, I am the wife of Rainsforth.--- My dear Celia, pray for me, that the tide of joy, which now ru[s]hes on my heart, may not impair my gratitude, or lead me through my adoration of the creature to forget the Creator, to whom only adoration is due. Oh, Heavenly Providence! am I indeed thus happy---yes, it is a ble[s]t reality. I can look up to a father to whom it is an honour to be allied. I can [s]ee the [s]weet effu[s]ions of maternal tenderne[s]s beam on me from a beloved mother's eyes. I am united to the man of my heart, I am the adopted mother of his children.---Where! where! is there a human being as [s]uperlatively happy as myself? happier they cannot be. I can lay my hand on my heart and fervently pray even for the felicity of my enemies. Enemies did I [s]ay, I will forget I ever had any, pa[s]t [s]cenes of [s]orrow [s]hall be obliterated from my memory, and remembering only the pre[s]ent happine[s]s I will endeavour to de[s]erve its [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v4&image=328-669.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] continuation, by exerting the abilities with which I am amply endowed to chear the desponding heart, [s]ooth the afflicted [s]pirits and [s]often the bed of pain!---Whatever injuries I have received, I will repay with kindne[s]s! and looking round the world with a [s]mile of tranquillity, wi[s]h every being as transcendently happy as my[s]elf! Mrs. On[s]low de[s]ires remembrances to you. My hu[s]band bids me [s]ay, [s]hould the commotions which at pre[s]ent agitate the Gallic [s]hore, di[s]turb you in your religious retreat; remember, you have a home, to which you can with confidence repair---a home, where you will be received with tran[s]port, and where you may con[s]ider your[s]elf in the mansion of a [s]i[s]ter! Heaven ble[s]s and protect you, is the ardent prayer of your friend in [s]incerity. MERIEL KINGLY. THE END. [4] Several letters between this and the preceding, are omitted.
