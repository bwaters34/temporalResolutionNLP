 Work, to address themselves to some Muse : and this Practice of the Antients has gain'd so much Repute, that in our days we find it almost constantly imitated. I cannot but fancy however, that this Imitation, which passes so currently with other Judgments, must at some time or other have stuck a little with your Lordship; who is us'd to examine Things by a better Standard than that of Fashion or the common Taste. You must certainly have observ'd our Poets under a remarkable Constraint, when oblig'd to assume this Character: and you have wonder'd, perhaps, why that Air of Enthusiasm which sits so gracefully with an Antient, shou'd be so spiritless and aukard in a Modern. But as to this Doubt, your Lordship wou'd have soon resolv'd your self: and it cou'd only serve to bring a-cross you a Reflection which you have often made, on many occasions besides; That Truth is the most powerful thing in the World , since even Fiction it self must be govern'd by it, and can only please by its resemblance. The Appearance of Reality is necessary to make any Passion agreeably represented: and to be able to move others, we must first be mov'd our-selves, or at least seem to be so, upon some probable Grounds. Now what possibility is there that a Modern, who is known never to have worship'd Apollo , or own'd any such Deity as the Muses , shou'd persuade us to enter into his pretended Devotion, and move us by his feign'd Zeal in a Religion out of date? But as for the Antients, 'tis known they deriv'd both their Religion and Polity from the Muses Art. How natural therefore must it have appear'd in any, but especially a Poet of those times, to address himself in Raptures of Devotion to those acknowledg'd Patronesses of Wit and Science? Here the Poet might with probability feign an Extasy, tho he really felt none: and supposing it to have been mere Affectation, it wou'd look however like something natural, and cou'd not fail of pleasing. Lordship knows, are wonderfully happy in a Faculty of deceiving themselves, whenever they set heartily about it: and a very small Foundation of any Passion will serve us, not only to act it well, but even to work our-selves into it beyond our own reach. Thus by a little Affectation in Love-Matters, and with the help of a Romance or Novel, a Boy of Fifteen, or a grave Man of Fifty, may be sure to grow a very natural Coxcomb, and feel the Belle Passion in good earnest. A Man of tolerable Good-Nature, who happens to be a little piqu'd, may, by improving his Resentment, become a very Fury for Revenge. Even a good Christian, who wou'd needs be over-good, and thinks he can never believe enough, may, by a small Inclination well improv'd, extend his Faith so largely, as to comprehend in it not only all Scriptural and Traditional Miracles, but a solid System of Old-Wives Storys. Were it needful, I cou'd put your Lordship in mind of an Eminent, Learned, and truly Christian Prelate you once knew, who cou'd have given you a full account of his Belief in Fairys . And this, methinks, may serve to make appear, how far an antient Poet's Faith might possibly have been rais'd, together with his Imagination. nothing to poor Heathens. They must be Infidels in every sense. We will not allow 'em to believe so much as their own Religion; which we cry is too absurd to have been credited by any besides the mere Vulgar. But if a Reverend Christian Prelate may be so great a Volunteer in Faith, as beyond the ordinary Prescription of the Catholick Church, to believe in Fairys ; why may not a Heathen Poet in the ordinary way of his Religion be allow'd to believe in Muses ? For these, your Lordship knows, were so many Divine Persons in the Heathen Creed, and were essential in their System of Theology. The Goddesses had their Temples and Worship, the same as the other Deitys: And to disbelieve the Holy Nine , or their Apollo , was the same as to deny Jove himself, and must have been esteem'd equally Profane and Atheistical by the generality of sober Men. Now what a mighty advantage must it have been to an antient Poet to be thus Orthodox, and by the help of his Education, and a Good-Will into the bargain, to work himself up to a Belief of a Divine Presence and Heavenly Inspiration? It was never surely the Business of Poets in those days to call Revelation in question, when it evidently made so well for their Art. On the contrary, they cou'd not fail to animate their Faith as much as possible; when by one strong Act of it, they cou'd raise themselves into such Angelical Company. How much the Imagination of such a Presence must exalt a Genius, we may observe merely from the Influence which an ordinary Presence has over Men. Our modern Wits are more or less rais'd by the Opinion they have of their Company, and the Idea they form to themselves of the Persons to whom they make their Addresses. A common Actor of the Stage will inform us how much a full Audience of the Better Sort exalts him above the common pitch. And you, my Lord, who are the noblest Actor, and of the noblest Part assign'd to any Mortal on this earthly Stage, when you are acting for Liberty and Mankind ; does not the publick Presence, that of your Friends, and the Well- wishers to your Cause, add something to your Thought and Genius? Or is that Sublime of Reason, and that Power of Eloquence, which you discover in publick, no more than what you are equally Master of in private, and can command at any time, alone, or with indifferent Company, or in any easy or cool hour? This indeed were more Godlike; but ordinary Humanity, I think, reaches not so high. Presence or Company to raise my Thoughts on any occasion, that when alone, I must endeavour by Strength of Fancy to supply this want; and in default of a Muse , must inquire out some Great Man of a more than ordinary Genius, whose imagin'd Presence may inspire me with more than what I feel at ordinary hours. And thus, my Lord, have I chosen to address my self to your Lordship; tho without subscribing my Name: allowing you, as a Stranger, the full Liberty of reading no more than what you may have a fancy for; but reserving to my self the privilege of imagining you read all, with particular notice, as a Friend, and one whom I may justifiably treat with the Intimacy and Freedom which follows. sufficient Security for the Vertue which is contrary, how excellent an Age might we be presum'd to live in! Never was there in our Nation a time known, when Folly and Extravagance of every kind was more sharply inspected, or more wittily ridicul'd. And one might hope at least from this good Symptom, that our Age was in no declining State; since whatever our Distempers are, we stand so well affected to our Remedys. To bear the being told of Faults, is in private Persons the best token of Amendment. 'Tis seldom that a Publick is thus dispos'd. For where Jealousy of State, or the Ill Lives of the Great People, or any other Cause is powerful enough to restrain the Freedom of Censure in any part, it in effect destroys the Benefit of it in the whole. There can be no impartial and free Censure of Manners where any peculiar Custom or National Opinion is set apart, and not only exempted from Criticism, but even flatter'd with the highest Art. 'Tis only in a free Nation, such as ours, that Imposture has no Privilege; and that neither the Credit of a Court, the Power of a Nobility, nor the Awfulness of a Church can give her Protection, or hinder her from being arraign'd in every Shape and Appearance. 'Tis true, this Liberty may seem to run too far. We may perhaps be said to make ill use of it.---So every one will say, when he himself is touch'd, and his Opinion freely examin'd. But who shall be Judg of what may be freely examin'd, and what may not? Where Liberty may be us'd; and where it may not? What Remedy shall we prescribe to this in general? Can there be a better than from that Liberty it self which is complain'd of? If Men are vicious, petulant or abusive; the Magistrate may correct them: But if they reason ill, 'tis Reason still must teach 'em to do better. Justness of Thought and Stile, Refinement in Manners, good Breeding, and Politeness of every kind, can come only from the Trial and Experience of what is best. Let but the Search go freely on, and the right Measure of every thing will soon be found. Whatever Humour has got the start, if it be unnatural, it cannot hold; and the Ridicule , if ill plac'd at first, will certainly fall at last where it deserves. I Have often wonder'd to see Men of Sense so mightily alarm'd at the approach of any thing like Ridicule on certain Subjects; as if they mistrusted their own Judgment. For what Ridicule can lie against Reason? Or how can any one of the least Justness of Thought endure a Ridicule wrong plac'd? Nothing is more ridiculous than this it self. The Vulgar, indeed, may swallow any sordid Jest, any mere Drollery or Buffoonery; but it must be a finer and truer Wit that takes with the Men of Sense and Breeding. How comes it to pass then, that we appear such Cowards in reasoning, and are so afraid to stand the Test of Ridicule?---O! say we, the Subjects are too grave--- Perhaps so: but let us see first whether they are really grave or no: for in the manner we may conceive 'em, they may peradventure be very grave and weighty in our Imagination; but very ridiculous and impertinent in their own nature. Gravity is of the very Essence of Imposture. It does not only make us to mistake other Things, but is apt perpetually almost to mistake it self. For in common Behaviour, how hard a thing is it for the grave Character to keep long out of the limits of the formal one? We can never be too grave, if we can but be assur'd we are really so: and we can never too much honour or revere any thing for grave; if we are assur'd the Thing is grave, as we apprehend it. The main Point is to know always true Gravity from the false : and this can only be, by carrying the Rule constantly with us, and freely applying it not only to the Things about us, but to ourselves. For if unhappily we lose the Measure in our-selves, we shall soon lose it in every thing besides. Now what Rule or Measure is there in the World, but by considering the real Temper of Things, to find which are truly serious, and which ridiculous? And how can this be done, but by applying the Ridicule , to see whether it will bear? But if we fear to apply this Rule in any thing, what Security can we have against the Imposture of Formality in all things? We have allow'd our-selves to be Formalists in one Point; and the same Formality may rule us as it pleases in all other. We must beforehand judg of our own Temper, and accordingly of other things that fall under our Judgment. But we must never more pretend to judg of things, or of our own Temper in judging them, when we have given up our preliminary Right of Judgment, and under a Presumption of Gravity, have allow'd our selves to be most ridiculous, and to admire profoundly the most ridiculous Things in nature, at least for ought we know. For having resolv'd never to try, we can never be sure. \--- Ridiculum acri Fortius & melius magnas plerumque secat res. Hor. Sat. 10. This, my Lord, I may safely aver, is so true a thing in it-self, and so well known for Truth by the cunning Formalists of the Age, that they can better bear to have their Impostures rail'd at, with all the Bitterness and Vehemence imaginable, than to have them touch'd ever so gently in this other way. They know very well, that as Modes and Fashions, so Opinions , tho ever so ridiculous, are kept up by Solemnity: and that those formal Notions which grew up probably in an ill Mood, and have been conceiv'd in sober Sadness, are never to be remov'd but in a sober kind of Chearfulness, and by a more easy and pleasant way of Thought. There is a Melancholy which accompanys all Enthusiasm. Be it Love or Religion (for there are Enthusiasms in both) nothing can put a stop to the growing mischief of either, till the Melancholy be remov'd, and the Mind at liberty to hear what can be said against the Ridiculousness of an Extreme in either way. as much as they pleas'd, and never to punish seriously what deserv'd only to be laugh'd at, and was after all best cur'd by that innocent Remedy. There are certain Humours in Mankind, which of necessity must have vent. The Human Mind and Body are both of 'em naturally subject to Commotions: and as there are strange Ferments in the Blood, which in many Bodys occasion an extraordinary discharge; so in Reason too, there are heterogeneous Particles which must be thrown off by Fermentation. Shou'd Physicians endeavour absolutely to allay those Ferments of the Body, and strike in the Humours which discover themselves in such Eruptions, they might, instead of making a Cure, bid fair perhaps to raise a Plague, and turn a Spring-Ague or an Autumn-Surfeit into an epidemical malignant Fever. They are certainly as ill Physicians in the Body- Politick , who wou'd needs be tampering with these mental Eruptions; and under the specious pretence of healing this Itch of Superstition, and saving Souls from the Contagion of Enthusiasm, shou'd set all Nature in an uproar, and turn a few innocent Carbuncles into an Inflammation and mortal Gangrene. in History that Pan , when he accompany'd Bagch us in an Expedition to the Indies , found means to strike a Terror thro a Host of Enemys, by the help of a small Company, whose Clamors he manag'd to good advantage among the ecchoing Rocks and Caverns of a woody Vale. The hoarse bellowing of the Caves, join'd to the hideous aspect of such dark and desart Places, rais'd such a Horror in the Enemy, that in this state their Imagination help'd 'em to hear Voices, and doubtless to see Forms too, that were more than Human: whilst the Uncertainty of what they fear'd made their Fear yet greater, and spread it faster by implicit Looks than any Narration cou'd convey it. And this was what in after-times Men call'd a Pannick . The Story indeed gives a good Hint of the nature of this Passion, which can hardly be without some mixture of Enthusiasm, and Horrors of a superstitious kind. Multitude, and convey'd by Aspect, or as it were by Contact or Sympathy. Thus popular Fury may be call'd Pannick , when the Rage of the People, as we have sometimes known, has put them beyond themselves; especially where Religion has had to do. And in this state their very Looks are infectious. The Fury flies from Face to Face: and the Disease is no sooner seen than caught. Those who in a better Situation of Mind have seen a Multitude under the power of this Passion, have own'd that they saw in the Countenances of Men something more ghastly and terrible than at other times is express'd on the most passionate occasions. Such force has Society in ill, as well as ingood Passions: and so much stronger any Affection is for being social and communicative. of Fear. And thus is Religion also Pannick ; when Enthusiasm of any kind gets up; as oft, on melancholy occasions, it will do. For Vapors naturally rise; and in bad times especially, when the Spirits of Men are low, as either in publick Calamitys, or during the Unwholesomness of Air or Diet, or when Convulsions happen in Nature, Storms, Earthquakes, or other amazing Prodigys: at this season the Pannick must needs run high, and the Magistrate of necessity give way to it. For to apply a serious Remedy, and to bring the Sword, or Fasces , as a Cure, must make the Case more melancholy, and increase the very Cause of the Distemper. To forbid Mens natural Fears, and to endeavour the overpowering them by other Fears, must needs be a most unnatural Method. The Magistrate, if he be any Artist, shou'd have a geatler hand; and instead of Causticks, Incisions, and Amputations, shou'd be using the softest Balms; and with a kind Sympathy entering into the Concern of the People, and taking, as it were, their Passion upon him, shou'd, when he has sooth'd and satisfy'd it, endeavour, by chearful ways, to divert and heal it. expresses it) it is necessary a People shou'd have a  2 Publick Leading in Religion. For to deny the Magistrate a Worship, or take away a National Church, is as mere Enthusiasm as the Notion which sets up Persecution. For why shou'd there not be publick Walks, as well as private Gardens? Why not publick Librarys, as well as private Education and Home- Tutors? But to prescribe bounds to Fancy and Speculation, to regulate Mens Apprehensions and religious Beliefs or Fears, to suppress by Violence the natural Passion of Enthusiasm, or to endeavour to ascertain it, or reduce it to one Species, or bring it under any one Modification, is in truth no better Sense, nor deserves a better Character, than what the Comedian declares of the like Project in the Affair of Love--- \--- Nihilo plus agas Qu am sides operam ut cum ratione insanias. Lordship knows, by the Antients: but on the other side, Philosophy had as free a course, and was permitted as a Ballance against Superstition. And whilst some Sects, such as the Pythagorean and latter Platonick , join'd in with the Superstition and Enthusiasm of the Times; the Epicurean , the Academick , and others, were allow'd to use all the Force of Wit and Raillery against it. And thus matters were ballanc'd; Reason had fair Play; Learning and Science flourish'd. Wonderful was the Harmony and Temper that arose from all these Contrarietys. Thus Superstition and Enthusiasm were mildly treated; and being let alone, they never rag'd to that degree as to occasion Bloodshed, Wars, Persecutions and Devastations in the World. But a new sort of Policy, which extends it self to another World, and considers the future Lives and Happiness of Men rather than the present, has made us leap the Bounds of natural Humanity; and out of a supernatural Charity, has taught us the way of plaguing one another most devoutly. It has rais'd an Antipathy which no temporal Interest cou'd ever do; and entail'd upon us a mutual Hatred to all Eternity. And now Uniformity in Opinion (a hopeful Project!) is look'd on as the only Expedient against this Evil. The saving of Souls is now the Heroick Passion of exalted Spirits; and is become in a manner the chief care of the Magistrate, and the very end of Government it-self. am afraid we shou'd have as bad Logick, as bad Mathematicks, and in every kind as bad Philosophy, as we often have Divinity, in Countrys where a precise Orthodoxy is settled by Law. 'Tis a hard matter for a Government to settle Wit. If it does but keep us sober and honest, 'tis likely we shall have as much Ability in our spiritual as in our temporal Affairs: and if we can but be trusted, we shall have Wit enough to save our-selves, when no prejudice lies in the way. But if Honesty and Wit be insufficient for this saving Work, 'tis in vain for the Magistrate to meddle with it: since if he be ever so vertuous or wise, he may be as soon mistaken as another Man. I am sure the only way to save Mens Sense, or preserve Wit at all in the World, is to give Liberty to Wit. Now Wit can never have its Liberty, where the Freedom of Raillery is taken away: For against serious Extravagances and spleenitick Humours there is no Remedy but this. treat other Enthusiasms as we please. We may ridicule Love, or Gallantry, or Knight-Errantry to the utmost; and we find, that in these latter days of Wit, the Humour of this kind, which was once so prevalent, is pretty well declin'd. The Crusades, the rescuing of Holy Lands, and such devout Gallantrys are in less request than formerly: But if something of this militant Religion, something of this Soul-rescuing Spirit, and Saint-Errantry prevails still, we need not wonder, when we consider in how solemn a manner we treat this Distemper, and how preposterously we go about to cure Enthusiasm. I Can hardly forbear fancying, that if we had but an Inquisition, or some formal Court of Judicature, with grave Officers and Judges, erected to restrain Poetical Licence, and in general to suppress that Fancy and Humour of Versification; but in particular that most extravagant Passion of Love, as it is set out by Poets, in its Heathenish Dress of Venus's and Cupid's : if the Poets, as Ringleaders and Teachers of this Heresy, were under grievous Penaltys forbid to enchant the People by their vein of Rhyming; and if the People, on the other side, were under proportionable Penaltys forbid to hearken to any such Charm, or lend their Attention to any Love-Tale, so much as in a Play, a Novel, or a Ballad; we might perhaps see a new Arcadia arising out of this heavy Persecution: Old People and Young wou'd be seiz'd with a versifying Spirit: We shou'd have Field-Conventicles of Lovers and Poets: Forests wou'd be fill'd with romantick Shepherds and Shepherdesses; and Rocks resound with Ecchoes of Hymns and Praises offer'd to the Powers of Love. We might indeed have a fair Chance, by this Management, to bring back the whole Train of Heathen Gods, and set our cold Northern Island burning with as many Altars to Venus and Grecian Climates. serious Subject as Religion , I shou'd forget my self so far as to give way to Raillery and Humour . I must own to you, my Lord, 'tis not merely thro Chance that this has happen'd. To say truth, I hardly care so much as to think on this Subject, much less to write on it, without endeavouring to put my self in as good Humour as is possible. People indeed, who can endure no middle Temper, but are all Air and Humour, know little of the Doubts and Scruples of Religion, and are safe from any immediate Influence of devout Melancholy or Enthusiasm ; which requires more Deliberation and thoughtful Practice to fix it self in a Temper, and grow habitual. But be the Habit what it will; to be deliver'd of it at so sad a Cost as Inconsiderateness, or Madness, is what I wou'd never wish to be my Lot. I had rather stand all Adventures with Religion, than endeavour to get rid of the Thoughts of it by Diversion. All I contend for, is to think of it in a right Humour : and that this goes more than half way towards thinking rightly of it, is what I shall endeavour to demonstrate. best Foundation of Piety and true Religion : For if right Thoughts and worthy Apprehensions of the Supreme Being, are fundamental to all true Worship and Adoration; 'tis more than probable, that we shall never miscarry in this respect, but thro ill Humour only. Nothing but ill Humour, either natural or forc'd, can bring a Man to think seriously that the World is govern'd by any devilish or malicious Power. I very much question whether any thing, besides ill Humour, can be the Cause of Atheism. For there are so many Arguments to persuade a Man in Humour, that, in the main, all things are kindly and well dispos'd, that one wou'd think it impossible for him to be so far out of conceit with Affairs, as to imagine they all ran at Adventures; and that the World , as venerable and wise a Face as it carry'd, had neither Sense nor Meaning in it. This however I am persuaded of, that nothing but ill Humour can give us dreadful or ill Thoughts of a Supreme Manager. Nothing can persuade us of Sullenness or Sourness in such a Being, but the fore-feeling of somewhat of this kind within our-selves: and if we are afraid of bringing good Humour into Religion, or thinking with Freedom and Pleasantness on such a Subject as God ; 'tis because we conceive the Subject so like our-selves, and can hardly have a Notion of Majesty and Greatness without Stateliness and Moroseness accompanying it. most divinely Good , when we see it, as we sometimes do, in Men of highest Power among us. If they pass for truly Good , we dare treat them freely, and are sure they will not be displeas'd with this Liberty. They are doubly Gainers by this Goodness of theirs. For the more they are search'd into and familiarly examind'd, the more their Worth appears; and the Discoverer, charm'd with his Success, esteems and loves more than ever, when he has prov'd this additional Bounty in his Superior, and reflects on that Candor and Generosity he has experienc'd. Your Lordship knows more perhaps of this Mystery than any one. How else shou'd you have been so belov'd in Power, and out of Power so adher'd to, and still more belov'd? Ages there have been many such. We have known mighty Princes, and even Emperors of the World, who cou'd bear unconcernedly not only the free Censure of their Actions, but the most spiteful Reproaches and Calumnys, even to their faces. Some perhaps may wish there had never been such Examples found in Heathens : but more especially, that the occasion had never been given by Christians . 'Twas more the Misfortune indeed of Mankind in general, than of Christians in particular, that some of the earlier Roman Emperors were such Monsters of Tyranny, and began a Persecution, not on religious Men merely, but on all that were suspected of Worth or Vertue. What cou'd have been a higher Honour or Advantage to Christianity, than to be persecuted by a severe Courses. 'Tis true, the Magistrate might possibly have been surpriz'd with the newness of a Notion, which he might pretend, perhaps, did not only destroy the Sacredness of his Power, but treated him and all Men as profane, impious, and damn'd, who enter'd not into certain particular Modes of Worship, of which there had been formerly so many thousand kinds instituted, all of 'em compatible and sociable till that time. However, such was the Wisdom of some succeeding Ministrys, that the edge of Persecution was much abated; and even 3 that Prince, who was esteem'd the greatest Enemy of the Christian Sect, and who himself had been educated in it, was a great Restrainer of Persecution, and wou'd allow of nothing further than a Resumption of Church-Lands and publick Schools, without any attempt on the Goods or Persons even of those who branded the State-Religion, and made a Merit of affronting the publick Worship. 'Tis well we have the Authority of a sacred Author in our Religion, to assure us, that the Spirit of Love and Humanity is above that of Martyrs . Otherwise, one might be a little scandaliz'd, perhaps, at the History of many of our primitive Confessors and Martyrs, even according to our own accounts. There is hardly now in the World so good a Christian (if this be indeed the Mark of a good one) who, supposing he liv'd at Constantinople , or elsewhere under the Protection of the Turks , wou'd think it fitting or decent to give any Disturbance to their Mosque -Worship. And as good Protestants, my Lord, as you and I are, we shou'd scarce think him better than a rank Enthusiast, who, out of Hatred to the Romish Idolatry, shou'd, in time of high Mass (where Mass perhaps was by Law establish'd) interrupt the Priest with Clamors, or fall foul on his Images and Relicks. lately come among us, who are mightily taken with this Primitive way. They have set a-foot the Spirit of Martyrdom to a wonder in their own Country; and they long to be trying it here, if we will give 'em leave, and afford 'em the Occasion: that is to say, if we will only do 'em the Favour to hang or imprison 'em; if we will only be so obliging as to break their Bones for 'em, after their Country fashion, blow up their Zeal, and stir a-fresh the Coals of Persecution. But no such Grace can they hitherto obtain of us. So hard-hearted we are, that notwithstanding their own Mob are willing to bestow kind Blows upon 'em, and fairly stone 'em now and then in the open Street; tho the Priests of their own Nation wou'd gladly give 'em their desir'd Discipline, and are earnest to light their probationary Fires for 'em; we English Men, who are Masters in our own Country, will not suffer the Enthusiasts to be thus us'd. Nor can we be suppos'd to act thus in envy to their Phenix -Sect, which it seems has risen out of the Flames, and wou'd willingly grow to be a new Church by the same manner of Propagation as the old one, whose Seed was truly said to be from the Blood of the Martyrs. tolerating English Men! For, not contented to deny these Prophesying Enthusiasts the Honour of a Persecution, we have deliver'd 'em over to the cruellest Contempt in the World. I am told, for certain, that they are at  4 this very time the Subject of a choice Droll or Puppet-Shew at Bart'lemy -Fair. There, doubtless, their strange Voices and involuntary Agitations are admirably well acted, by the Motion of Wires, and Inspiration of Pipes. For the Bodys of the Prophets, in their State of Prophecy, being not in their own power, but (as they say themselves) mere passive Organs, actuated by an exterior Force, have nothing natural, or resembling real Life, in any of their Sounds or Motions: so that how aukardly soever a Puppet-Shew may imitate other Actions, it must needs represent this Passion to the Life. And whilst Bart'lemy -Fair is in possession of this Privilege, I dare stand Security to our National Church, that no Sect of Enthusiasts, no new Venders of Prophecy or Miracles, shall ever get the Start, or put her to the trouble of trying her Strength with 'em, in any Case. us'd in a more tragical way. Many of our first Reformers, 'tis fear'd, were little better than Enthusiasts: and God knows whether a Warmth of this kind did not considerably help us in throwing off that spiritual Tyranny. So that had not the Priests, as is usual, prefer'd the love of Blood to all other Passions, they might in a merrier way, perhaps, have evaded the greatest Force of our reforming Spirit. I never heard that the antient Heathens were so well advis'd in their ill. Purpose of suppressing the Christian Religion in its first Rise, as to make use, at any time, of this Bart'lemy -Fair Method. But this I am persuaded of, that had the Truth of the Gospel been any way surmountable, they wou'd have bid much fairer for the silencing it, if they had chose to bring our primitive Founders upon the Stage in a pleasanter way than that of Bear-Skins and Pitch-Barrels. cloudy People, and wou'd endure little Raillery in any thing; much less in what belong'd to any Religious Doctrines or Opinions. Religion was look'd upon with a sullen Eye; and Hanging was the only Remedy they cou'd prescribe for any thing that look'd like setting up a new Revelation. The sovereign Argument was, Crucify, Crucify . But with all their Malice and Inveteracy to our Saviour, and his Apostles after him, had they but taken the Fancy to act such Puppet-Shews in his Contempt, as at this hour the Papists are acting in his Honour; I am apt to think they might possibly have done our Religion more Harm, than by all their other ways of Severity. I Believe our great and learned Apostle, found less  6 Advantage from the easy Treatment of his Athenian Antagonists, than from the surly and curst Spirit of the most persecuting Jewish Citys. He made less Improvement of the Candour and Civility of his Roman Judges, than of the Zeal of the Synagogue, and Vehemence of his National Priests. Tho when I consider this Apostle as appearing either before the witty Athenians , or before a Roman Court of Judicature, in the Presence of their great Men and Ladys, and see how handsomly he accommodates himself to the Apprehensions and Temper of those politer People, I do not find that he declines the way of Wit or good Humour ; but, without Suspicion of his Cause, is willing generously to commit it to this Proof, and try it against the Sharpness of any Ridicule that might be offer'd. against our Saviour or his Apostles; the irreligious part of the Heathens had try'd it long before against the best Doctrines and best Characters of Men that had ever arisen amongst 'em. Nor did this prove in the end any Injury, but on the contrary the highest Advantage to those very Characters and Doctrines, which, having stood the Proof, were found so solid and just. The divinest Man that had appear'd ever in the Heathen World, was in the height of witty Times, and by the wittiest of all Poets, most abominably ridicul'd, in a whole Comedy writ and acted on purpose. But so far was this from sinking his Reputation, or suppressing his Philosophy, that they both increas'd the more for it; and he apparently grew to be more the Envy of other Teachers. He was not only contented to be ridicul'd; but, that he might help the Poet as much as possible, he presented himself openly in the Theater; that his real Figure (which was no advantageous one) might be compar'd with that which the witty Poet had brought as his Representative on the Stage. Such was his good Humour . Nor cou'd there be in the World a greater Testimony of the invincible Goodness of the Man, or a greater Demonstration, that there was no Imposture either in his Character or Opinions. For that Imposture shou'd dare sustain the encounter of a grave Enemy, is no wonder. A solemn Attack, she knows, is not of such danger to her. There is nothing she abhors or dreads like Pleasantness and good Humour. according to my Apprehension, renders it so tragical, and is the occasion of its acting in reality such dismal Tragedys in the World. And my Notion is, that provided we treat Religion with good Manners, we can never use too much good Humour , or examine it with too much Freedom and Familiarity . For, if it be genuine and sincere, it will not only stand the Proof, but thrive and gain Advantage from hence: if it be spurious, or mixt with any Imposture, it will be detected and expos'd. to think of it in good Humour. 'Tis in Adversity chiefly, or in ill Health, under Affliction, or Disturbance of Mind, or Discomposure of Temper, that we have recourse to it. Tho in reality we are never so unfit to think of it as at such a heavy and dark Hour. We can never be fit to contemplate any thing above us, when we are in no Condition to look into ourselves, and calmly examine the Temper of our own Mind and Passions. For then it is we see Wrath, and Fury, and Revenge, and Terrors in the Deity ; when we are full of Disturbances and Fears within , and have, by Sufferance and Anxiety, lost so much of the natural Calm and Easiness of our Temper. and in the sweetest, kindest Disposition of our Lives, to understand well what true Goodness is, and what those Attributes imply, which we ascribe with such Applause and Honour to the Deity . We shall then be able to see best, whether those Forms of Justice, those Degrees of Punishment, that Temper of Resentment, and those Measures of Offence and Indignation, which we vulgarly suppose in God , are sutable to those original Ideas of Goodness , which the same Divine Being, or Nature under him, has implanted in us, and which we must necessarily presuppose, in order to give him Praise or Honour in any kind. This, my Lord, is the Security against all Superstition: To remember, that there is nothing in God but what is Godlike ; and that He is either not at all, or truly and perfectly Good . But when we are afraid to use our Reason freely, even on that very Question, Whether He really be , or not ; we then actually presume him bad , and flatly contradict that pretended Character of Goodness and Greatness; whilst we discover this mistrust of his Temper, and fear his Anger and Resentment, in the case of this Freedom of Inquiry. As patient as Job is said to be, it cannot be deny'd but he makes bold enough with God , and takes his Providence roundly to task. His Friends, indeed, plead hard with him, and use all Arguments, right or wrong, to patch up Objections, and set the Affairs of Providence upon an equal foot. They make a Merit of saying all the Good they can of God , at the very stretch of their Reason, and sometimes quite beyond it. But this, in Job's opinion, is flattering God , accepting of God's Person , and even mocking him . And no wonder. For, what Merit can there be in believing in assuming an Opinion contrary to the appearance of Things, and resolving to hear nothing that may be said against it? Excellent Character of the God of Truth ! that he shou'd be offended at us, for having refus'd to put the lye upon our Understandings, as much as in us lay; and be satisfy'd with us for having believ'd, at a venture, and against our Reason, what might have been the greatest Falshood in the world, for any thing we cou'd bring as a Proof or Evidence to the contrary! of a God : for this is wishing against the Publick, and even against one's private Good too, if rightly understood. But if a Man has not any such Ill- will to stifle his Belief, he must have surely an unhappy Opinion of God , and believe him not so good by far as he knows Himself to be, if he imagines that an impartial use of his Reason, in any matter of Speculation whatsoever, can make him run any Risk Hereafter; and that a mean Denial of his Reason , and an Affectation of Belief in any Point too hard for his Understanding, can intitle him to any Favour in another World. This is being Sycophants in Religion, mere Parasites of Devotion. 'Tis using God as the crafty Beggars use those they address to, when they are ignorant of their Quality. The Novices amongst 'em may innocently come out, perhaps, with a Good Sir ! or a Good Forsooth ! But with the old Stagers, no matter who they meet in a Coach, 'tis always Good your Honour ! or Good your Lordship ! or Your Ladyship ! For if there shou'd be really a Lord in the case, we shou'd be undone (say they) for want of giving the Title: But if the Party shou'd be no Lord , there wou'd be no Offence; it wou'd not be ill taken. and think all depends upon hitting the Title , and making a good Guess . 'Tis the most beggarly Refuge imaginable, which is so mightily cry'd up, and stands as a great Maxim with many able Men; "That they shou'd strive to have Faith , and believe to the utmost: because if, after all, there be nothing in the matter, there will be no harm in being thus deceiv'd; but if there be any thing, it will be fatal for them not to have believ'd to the full." But they are so far mistaken, that whilst they have this Thought, 'tis certain they can never believe either to their Satisfaction and Happiness in this World, or with any advantage of Recommendation to another. For besides that our Reason, which knows the Cheat, will never rest thorowly satisfy'd on such a Bottom, but turn us often a-drift, and toss us in a Sea of Doubt and Perplexity; we cannot but actually grow worse in our Religion, and entertain a worse Opinion still of a Supreme Deity , whilst our Belief is founded on so injurious a Thought of him. of the whole World, as far as lies within our power, is surely the Height of Goodness, and makes that Temper which we call Divine . In this Temper, my Lord, (for surely you shou'd know it well) 'tis natural for us to wish that others shou'd partake with us, by being convinc'd of the Sincerity of our Example. 'Tis natural for us to wish our Merit shou'd be known; particularly, if it be our Fortune to have serv'd a Nation as a good Minister; or as some Prince, or Father of a Country, to have render'd happy a considerable Part of Mankind under our Care. But if it happen'd, that of this Number there shou'd be some so ignorantly bred, and of so remote a Province, as to have lain out of the hearing of our Name and Actions; or hearing of 'em, shou'd be so puzzl'd with odd and contrary Storys told up and down concerning us, that they knew not what to think, whether there were really in the World any such Person as our-self: Shou'd we not, in good truth, be ridiculous to take offence at this? And shou'd we not pass for extravagantly morose and ill-humour'd, if instead of treating the matter in Raillery , we shou'd think in earnest of revenging our selves on the offending Partys, who, out of their rustick Ignorance, ill Judgment, or Incredulity, had detracted from our Renown? about it? Is the doing Good for Glory 's sake, so divine a thing? or, Is it not diviner, to do Good even where it may be thought inglorious, even to the Ingrateful, and to those who are wholly insensible of the Good they receive? How comes it then that what is so divine in us, shou'd lose its Character in the Divine Being ? And that according as the Deity is represented to us, he shou'd more resemble the weak, womanish, and impotent part of our Nature, than the generous, manly, and divine? Weaknesses at first Sight, and distinguish the Features of human Frailty, with which we are so well acquainted. One wou'd think it were easy to understand, that Provocation and Offence, Anger, Revenge, Jealousy in point of Honour or Power, Love of Fame, Glory, and the like, belong only to limited Beings, and are necessarily excluded a Being which is perfect and universal. But if we have never settl'd with our selves any Notion of what is morally excellent ; or if we cannot trust to that Reason which tells us, that nothing but what is so , can have place in the Deity ; we can neither trust to any thing that others relate of him, or that himself reveals to us. We must be satisfy'd before-hand, that he is good , and cannot deceive us. Without this, there can be no real religious Faith, or Confidence. Now, if there be really something previous to Revelation, some antecedent Demonstration of Reason, to assure us, that God is , and withal, that he is so good as not to deceive us; the same Reason, if we will trust to it, will demonstrate to us, that God is so good , as to exceed the very best of us in Goodness . And after this manner we can have no Dread or Suspicion to render us uneasy: for it is Malice only, and not Goodness , that can make us afraid. sovereign to those who can apply it; and it is this: "There can be no Malice but where Interests are oppos'd. A universal Being can have no Interest opposite; and therefore can have no Malice." If there be a general Mind , it can have no particular Interest: But the general Good, or Good of the Whole, and its own private Good, must of necessity be one and the same. It can intend nothing besides, nor aim at any thing beyond, nor be provok'd to any thing contrary. So that we have only to consider, whether there be really such a thing as a Mind that has relation to the Whole , or not. For if unhappily there be no Mind , we may comfort our selves, however, that Nature has no Malice : If there be really a Mind , we may rest satisfy'd, that it is the best natur'd one in the World . The last Case, one wou'd imagine, shou'd be the most comfortable; and the Notion of a common Parent less frightful than that of forlorn Nature , and a fatherless World . Tho, as Religion stands amongst us, there are many good People who wou'd have less Fear in being thus expos'd; and wou'd be easier, perhaps, in their Mind, if they were assur'd they had only mere Chance to trust to. For no body trembles to think there shou'd be no God ; but rather, that there shou'd be one . This however wou'd be otherwise, if Deity were thought as kindly of as Humanity ; and we cou'd be persuaded to believe, that if there really was a God , the highest Goodness must of necessity belong to him, without any of those  7 Defects of Passion, those Meannesses and Imperfections which we acknowledg such in our-selves, which as good Men we endeavour all we can to be superior to, and which we find we every day conquer as we grow better. the higher Regions of Divinity , we wou'd vouchsafe to descend a little into ourselves , and bestow some poor Thoughts upon plain honest Morals . When we had once look'd into our selves, and distinguish'd well the nature of our own Affections, we shou'd probably be fitter Judges of the Divineness of a Character, and discern better what Affections were sutable or unsutable to a perfect Being . We might then understand how to love , and praise , when we had acquir'd some consistent Notion of what was laudable or lovely . Otherwise we might chance to do God little Honour, when we intended him the most. For 'tis hard to imagine, what Honour can arise to the Deity from the Praises of Creatures, who are unable to discern what is Praise- worthy or Excellent in their own Kind. no Ear in Musick, he wou'd surely be put to the Blush, and cou'd hardly, with a good Countenance, accept the Benevolence of his Auditors, till they had acquir'd a more competent Apprehension of him, and cou'd by their own Senses find out something that was really good in his Performance. Till this were brought about, there wou'd be little Glory in the case; and the Musician, tho ever so vain, wou'd have little reason to be contented. be impertinently applauded. I know not how it comes about, that He who is ever said to do Good the most disinterestedly, shou'd be thought desirous of being prais'd so lavishly, and be suppos'd to set so high a Rate upon so cheap and low a Thing, as ignorant Commendation , and forc'd Applause. understand very well, and yet not possess. We may have an excellent Ear in Musick , without being able to perform in any kind. We may judg well of Poetry , without being Poets, or possessing the least of a Poetick Vein: But we can have no tolerable Notion of Goodness , without being tolerably good . So that if the Praise of a Divine Being be so great a part of his Worship, we shou'd, methinks, learn Goodness , were it for nothing else but that we might learn, in some tolerable manner, how to praise . For the praise of Goodness from an unsound hollow Heart, must certainly make the greatest Dissonance in the World. looking into our-selves, may do us wond'rous Service, in rectifying our Errors in Religion. For there is a sort of Enthusiasm of second hand. And when Men find no original Commotions in themselves, no prepossessing Pannick that bewitches 'em, they are apt still, by the Testimony of others, to be impos'd on, and led credulously into the Belief of many false Miracles. And this Habit may make 'em variable, and of a very inconstant Faith, easy to be carry'd away with every Wind of Doctrine, and addicted to every upstart Sect or Superstition. But the knowledg of our Passions in their very Seeds, the measuring well the Growth and Progress of Enthusiasm, and the judging rightly of its natural Force, and what command it has over our very Senses, may teach us to oppose more successfully those Delusions which come arm'd with the specious Pretext of moral Certainty, and Matter of Fact. among many other Miracles, to have had a most signal one, acted premeditately, and with warning, before many hundreds of People, who actually give Testimony to the Truth of it. But I wou'd only ask, Whether there were present, among those hundreds, any one Person, who having never been of their Sect , or addicted to their Way , will give the same Testimony with them? I must not be contented to ask, Whether such a one had been wholly free of that particular Enthusiasm? but, Whether, before that time, he was esteem'd of so found a Judgment, and clear a Head, as to be wholly free of Melancholy , and in all likelihood incapable of all Enthusiasm besides? For otherwise, the Pannick may have been caught; the Evidence of the Senses lost, as in a Dream; and the Imagination so inflam'd, as in a moment to have burnt up every Particle of Judgment and Reason. The combustible Matters lie prepar'd within, and ready to take fire at a Spark; but chiefly in a Multitude seiz'd with that Spirit. No wonder if the Blaze arises so of a sudden; when innumerable Eyes glow with the Passion, and heaving Breasts are labouring with Inspiration: When not the Aspect only, but the very Breath and Exhalations of Men are infectious, and the inspiring Disease imparts it-self by insensible Transpiration. I am not a Divine good enough to resolve what Spirit that was which prov'd so catching among the antient Prophets, that even the profane  8 the 9 evil , as well as the good Spirit of Prophecy. And I find by present Experience, as well as by all Historys, Sacred and Profane, that the Operation of this Spirit is every where the same, as to the bodily Organs. A Gentleman who has writ lately in defence of reviv'd Prophecy, and has since fallen himself into the prophetick Extasys , tells us, "That the antient Prophets had the Spirit of God upon them under Extasy , with divers strange Gestures of Body denominating them Madmen, (or Enthusiasts) as appears evidently, says he , in the Instances of Balaam, Saul, David, Ezekiel, Daniel ,  &c." And he proceeds to justify this by the Practice of the Apostolick Times, and by the Regulation which the Apostle himself applys to these seemingly irregular Gifts , so frequent and ordinary (as our Author pretends) in the primitive Church, on the first rise and spreading of Christianity. But I leave it to him to make the Resemblance as well as he can between his own and the Apostolick way. I only know, that the Symptoms he describes, and which himself (poor Gentleman!) labours under, are as Heathenish as he can possibly pretend them to be Christian . And when I saw him lately under an Agitation (as they call it) uttering Prophecy in a pompous Latin Stile, of which, out of his Extasy, it seems, he is wholly incapable; it brought into my Mind the Latin Poet's Description of the Sybil , whose Agonys were so perfectly like these. \--- Subit o non vultus, non color unus, Non compt ae mansere comae; sed pectus anhelum, Et rabie fera corda tument; majorque videri Nec mortale sonans: afflata est Numine quando Jam propiore Dei .--- Virg. Æn. Lib. 6. And again, presently after: \--- Immanis in antro Bacchatur Vates, magnum si pectore possit Excussisse Deum: tanto magis Ille fatigat Os rabidum, fera corda domans, Which is the very Stile of our experienc'd Author. "For the Inspir'd ( says he ) undergo a Probation, wherein the Spirit, by frequent Agitations, forms the Organs , ordinarily for a Month or two before Utterance ." out in Rome long before his days, describes this Spirit of Prophecy; Viros, velut mente capt a, cum jactatione fanatica corporis vaticinari . Liv. 39. The detestable Things that follow I wou'd not willingly transcribe: but the Senate's mild Decree in so execrable a Case, I can't omit copying; being satisfy'd, that tho your Lordship has read it before now, you can read it again and again with admiration: In reliquem deinde (says Livy ) S. C. cautum est ,  &c. Si quis tale sacrum solenne & necessarium duceret, nec sine Religione & Piaculo se id omittere posse; apud Proetorem Vrbanum profiteretur: Proetor Senatum consuleret. Si ei permissum esset, cum in Senatu centum non minus essent, ita id sacrum faceret; dum ne plus quinque sacrificio interessent, neu qua pecunia communis, neu quis Magister sacrorum, aut Sacerdos esset. even that Philosopher who bent the whole Force of his Philosophy against Superstition, appears to have left room for visionary Fancy, and to have indirectly tolerated Enthusiasm. For it is hard to imagine, that one who had so little religious Faith as Epicurus , shou'd have so vulgar a Credulity, as to believe those accounts of Armys and Castles in the Air, and such visionary Phoenomena . Yet he allows them; and then thinks to solve 'em by his Effluvia , and Aerial Looking-glasses, and I know not what other Stuff: which his Latin Poet, however, sets off beautifully, as he does all. \--- Rerum Simulacra vagari Multa, modis multis, in cunctas undique parteis Tenuia, quoe facil e inter se junguntur in auris , Obvia c um veniunt, at aranea bracteaque auri ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Centauros itaque, & Scyllarum Membra videmus, Cerbereasque canum facies, simulacraque eorum Quorum morte obita tellus amplectitur ossa: Omne genus quoniam passim simulacra feruntur, Partim sponte su a quoe fiunt aere in ipso; Partim quoe variis ab rebus cumque recedunt. Lucret. l.4. Visionary Spirit originally in Human Nature. He was so satisfy'd that Men were inclin'd to see Visions, that rather than they shou'd go without, he chose to make 'em to their hand. Notwithstanding he wou'd not allow the Principles of Religion to be natural , he was forc'd tacitly to allow there was a wondrous Disposition in Mankind towards supernatural Objects ; and that if these Ideas were vain, they were yet in a manner innate , or such as Men were really born to, and cou'd hardly by any means avoid. From which Concession a Divine, methinks, might raise a good Argument against him, for the Truth as well as the Usefulness of Religion . But so it is: whether the matter of Apparition be true or false, the Symptoms are the same, and the Passion of equal force in the Person who is Vision-struck. The Lymphatici of the Latins were the Nympholepti of the Greeks . They were Persons said to have seen some Species of Divinity, as either some Rural Deity , or Nymph , which threw them into such Transports as overcame their Reason. The Extasys express'd themselves outwardly in Quakings, Tremblings, Tossings of the Head and Limbs, Agitations , and (as Livy calls them) Fanatical Throws or Convulsions, extemporary Prayer, Prophecy, Singing, and the like. All Nations have their Lymphaticks of some kind or another; and all Churches (Heathen as well as Christian) have had their Complaints against Fanaticism. that which they call'd Hydrophoby . Whether the Antient Lymphaticks had any way like that of biting, to communicate the Rage of their Distemper, I can't so positively determine. But certain Fanaticks there have been since the time of the Antients, who have had a most prosperous Faculty of communicating the Appetite of the Teeth. For since first the snappish Spirit got up in Religion, all Sects have been at it, as the saying is, Tooth and Nail ; and are never better pleas'd, than in worrying one another without mercy. the Party is struck by the Apparition, there follows always an Itch of imparting it, and kindling the same fire in other Breasts. For thus Poets are Fanaticks too. And thus Horace either is, or feigns himself Lymphatick , and shews what an Effect the Vision of the Nymphs and Bacchum in remotis carmina rupibus Vidi docentem, credite posteri, NYMPHAS que discentes ,--- Evoe! recenti mens trepidat metu, Plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum 10 LYMPHATVR \------ as Heinsius reads: Od. 19\. L. 2\. thing great in his own way, without the Imagination or Supposition of a Divine Presence , which may raise him to some degree of this Passion we are speaking of. Even the cold Lucretius makes use of Inspiration, when he writes against it; and is forc'd to raise an Apparition of Nature , in a Divine Form, to animate and conduct him in his very Work of degrading Nature, and despoiling her of all her seeming Wisdom and Divinity. Alma Venus , coeli subter labentia signa Quoe mare navigerum, que terras frugiferenteis Concelebras \--- Qu ae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas, Nec sine te quidquam dias in luminis or as Exoritur, neque fit loetum neque amabile quidquam: Te sociam studeo scribundis versibus esse, Quos Ego de rerum natur a pangere conor Lucret. l. I. nice Judgment, and the hardest thing in the world to know fully and distinctly; since even  11 Atheism is not exempt from it. For, as some have well remark'd, there have been Enthusiastical Atheists . Nor can Divine Inspiration, by its outward Marks, be easily distinguish'd from it. For Inspiration is a real feeling of the Divine Presence, and Enthusiasm a false one . But the Passion they raise is much alike. For when the Mind is taken up in Vision, and fixes its view either on any real Object, or mere Specter of Divinity; when it sees, or thinks it sees any thing prodigious, and more than human; its Horrour, Delight, Confusion, Fear, Admiration, or whatever Passion belongs to it, or is uppermost on this occasion, will have something vast, immane , and (as Painters say) beyond Life . And this is what gave occasion to the name of Fanaticism , as it was us'd by the Antients in its original Sense, for an Apparition transporting the Mind. receiv'd are too big for the narrow human Vessel to contain. So that Inspiration may be justly call'd Divine Enthusiasm : For the Word it self signifies Divine Presence , and was made use of by the Philosopher whom the earliest Christian Fathers call'd Divine , to express whatever was sublime in human Passions  12 This was the Spirit he allotted to Heroes, Statesmen, Poets, Orators, Musicians , and even Philosophers themselves. Nor can we, of our own accord, forbear ascribing to a noble Enthusiasm, whatever is greatly perform'd by any of These . So that almost all of us know something of this Principle. But to know it as we shou'd do, and discern it in its several kinds, both in ourselves, and others; this is the great Work, and by this means alone we can hope to avoid Delusion. For to judg the Spirits whether they are of God , we must antecedently judg our own Spirit ; whether it be of Reason , and sound Sense ; whether it be fit to judg at all, by being sedate, cool, and impartial; free of every byassing Passion, every giddy Vapour, or melancholy Fume. This is the first Knowledg and previous Judgment: to understand ourselves , and know what Spirit we are of . Afterwards we may judg the Spirit in others, consider what their personal Merit is, and prove the Validity of their Testimony by the Solidity of their Brain. By this means we may prepare our-selves with some Antidote against Enthusiasm. And this is what I have dar'd affirm is best perform'd by keeping to Good Humour . For otherwise the Remedy itself may turn to the Disease. you after the manner I have done, you must allow me to plead an Impulse . You must suppose me (as with truth you may) most passionately yours; and with that Kindness which is natural to you on other occasions, you must tolerate your Enthusiastick Friend , who, excepting only in the case of this over- forward Zeal , can never but appear, with the highest Respect, My LORD, Your Lordship's ,  &c. Humour. In a Letter to a Friend H ac urget Lupus, ha Canis--- Hor. Sat. 2. Lib. 2. a Surprize as you did the other day, when I happen'd to speak to you in commendation of Raillery . Was it possible you shou'd suppose me so grave a Man as to dislike all Conversation of this kind? Or were you afraid I shou'd not stand the trial, if you put me to it, by making the experiment in my own Case? I Must confess, you had reason enough for your Caution; if you cou'd imagine me at the bottom so true a Zealot , as not to bear the least Raillery on my own Opinions. 'Tis the Case, I know, with Many. Whatever they think grave or solemn, they suppose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn way: Tho what Another thinks so, they can be contented to treat otherwise; and are forward to try the Edge of Ridicule against any Opinions besides their own. and reasonable, to make as free with our own Opinions, as with those of other People ? For to be sparing in this case, may be look'd upon as a piece of Selfishness. We may be charg'd perhaps with wilful Ignorance and blind Idolatry, for having taken Opinions upon Trust, and consecrated in our-selves certain Idol -Notion, which we will never suffer to be unveil'd, or seen in open light. They may perhaps be Monsters, and not Divinitys, or Sacred Truths, which are kept thus choicely, in some dark Corner of our Minds: The Specters may impose on us, whilst we refuse to turn 'em every way, and view their Shapes and Complexions in every light. For that which can be shewn only in a certain Light, is questionable. Truth, 'tis suppos'd, may bear all Lights: and one of those principal Lights or natural Mediums, by which Things are to be view'd, in order to a thorow Recognition, is Ridicule it-self, or that Manner of Proof by which we discern whatever is liable to just Raillery in any Subject. So much, at least, is allow'd by All, who at any time appeal to this Criterion . The gravest Gentlemen, even in the gravest Subjects, are suppos'd to acknowledg this: and can have no Right, 'tis thought, to deny others the Freedom of this Appeal; whilst they are free to censure like other Men, and in their gravest Arguments make no scruple to ask, Is it not ridiculous ? Sentiments are. And by this means you will be able to judg of me; whether I was sincere the other day in the Defence of Raillery , and can continue still to plead for those ingenious Friends of ours, who are often censur'd for their Humour of this kind, and for the Freedom they take in such an airy way of Conversation and Writing. species of Wit, and to what an excess it has risen of late, in some Characters of the Age; one may be startled a little, and in doubt, what to think of the Practice, or whither this rallying Humour will at length carry us. It has pass'd from the Men of Pleasure to the Men of Business. Politicians have been infected with it: and the grave Affairs of State have been treated with an Air of Irony and Banter . The ablest Negotiators have been known the notablest Buffoons : the most celebrated Authors, the greatest Masters of Burlesque. I am willing enough to allow in Affairs of whatever kind; when the Spirit of Curiosity wou'd force a Discovery of more Truth than can conveniently be told. For we can never do more injury to Truth, than by discovering too much of it, on some occasions. 'Tis the same with Understandings as with Eyes: To such a certain Size and Make just so much Light is necessary, and no more. Whatever is beyond, brings Darkness and Confusion. And to do this by a pleasant Amusement, is easier and civiller, than by a harsh Denial, or remarkable Reserve. But to go about industriously to confound Men, in a mysterious manner; and to make advantage or draw pleasure from that Perplexity they are thrown into, by such uncertain Talk; is as unhandsom in a way of Raillery, as when done with the greatest Seriousness, or in the most solemn way of Deceit. It may be necessary, as well now as heretofore, for wise Men to speak in Parables , and with a double Meaning, that the Enemy may be amus'd, and those only who have Ears to hear, may hear . But 'tis a mean, impotent, and dull sort of Wit, which amuses all alike, and leaves the most sensible Man, and even a Friend, equally in doubt, and at a loss to understand what one's real mind is, upon any Subject. Company. And indeed there is as much difference between one sort and another, as between Fair-dealing and Hypocrisy; or between the genteelest Wit, and the most scurrilous Buffoonery. But by Freedom of Conversation this illiberal kind of Wit will lose its Credit. For Wit is its own Remedy. Liberty and Commerce bring it to its true Standard. The only danger is, the laying an Embargo. The same thing happens here, as in the Case of Trade . Impositions and Restrictions reduce it to a low Ebb: Nothing is so advantageous to it as a Free-Port. which so much delighted our Ancestors, that their Poems and Plays, as well as Sermons, were full of it. All Humour had something of the Quibble . The very Language of the Court was Punning . But 'tis now banish'd the Town, and all good Company: There are only some few Footsteps of it in the Country; and it seems at last confin'd to the Nurserys of Youth, as the chief Entertainment of Pedants and their Pupils. And thus in other respects Wit will mend upon our hands, and Humour will refine it-self; if we take care not to tamper with it, and bring it under Constraint, by severe Usage and rigorous Prescriptions. All Politeness is owing to Liberty. We polish one another, and rub off our Corners and rough Sides by a sort of amicable Collision . To restrain this, is inevitably to bring a Rust upon Mens Understandings. 'Tis a destroying of Civility, Good Breeding, and even Charity it-self, under pretence of maintaining it. little to the purpose, as to define Good Breeding . None can understand the Speculation, but they who have the Practice. Yet every one thinks himself well-bred : and the formallest Pedant imagines he can railly with a good Grace and Humour. I have known some of those grave Gentlemen undertake to correct an Author for defending the Use of Raillery, and at the same time have upon every turn made use of that Weapon, tho they were naturally so very aukard at it. And this I believe may be observ'd in the Case of many Zealots, who have taken upon 'em to answer our modern Free-Writers. The Tragical Gentlemen, with the grim Aspect and Mein of true Inquisitors , have but an ill Grace when they vouchsafe to quit their Austerity, and be jocose and pleasant with an Adversary, whom they wou'd chuse to treat in a very different manner. For to do 'em justice, had they their Wills, I doubt not but their Conduct and Mein wou'd be pretty much of a piece. They wou'd, in all probability, soon quit their Farce, and make a thorow Tragedy. But at present there is nothing so ridiculous as this Janus -Face of Writers, who with one Countenance force a Smile, and with another show nothing but Rage and Fury. Having enter'd the Lists, and agreed to the fair Laws of Combat by Wit and Argument, they have no sooner prov'd their Weapon, than you hear 'em crying aloud for help, and delivering over to the Secular Arm. Merry \- Andrew acting their Part upon the same Stage. Yet I am persuaded any one will find this to be the real Picture of certain modern Zealots in their Controversial Writings. They are no more Masters of Gravity, than they are of Good Humour. The first always runs into harsh Severity, and the latter into an aukard Buffoonery. And thus between Anger and Pleasure, Zeal and Drollery, their Writing has much such a Grace as the Play of humoursom Children, who, at the same instant, are both peevish and wanton, and can laugh and cry almost in one and the same breath. How agreeable such Writings are like to prove, and of what effect towards the winning over or convincing those who are suppos'd to be in Error, I need not go about to explain. Nor can I wonder, on this account, to hear those publick Lamentations of Zealots, that whilst the Books of their Adversarys are so current, their Answers to 'em can hardly make their way into the World, or be taken the least notice of. Pedantry and Bigotry are Mill-stones able to sink the best Book, that carries the least part of their dead weight. The Temper of the Pedagogue sutes not with the Age. And the World, however it may be taught , will not be tutor'd . If a Philosopher speaks, Men hear him willingly, while he keeps to his Philosophy. So is a Christian heard, while he keeps to his profess'd Charity and Meekness. In a Gentleman we allow of Pleasantry and Raillery, as being manag'd always with good Breeding, and never gross or clownish. But if a mere Scholastick, intrenching upon all these Characters, and writing as it were by Starts and Rebounds from one of these to another, appears upon the whole as little able to keep the Temper of Christianity, as to use the Reason of a Philosopher, or the Raillery of a Man of Breeding; what wonder is it, if the monstrous Product of such a jumbled Brain be ridiculous to the World? any of these Zealot-Writers in religious Controversy; read but a few Pages in any one of 'em (even where the Contest is not Abroad , but within their own Pale ) and then pronounce. shall hear my Thoughts, as you have desir'd, upon the Subject of Conversation , and particularly a late One of a free kind, which you remember I was present at, with some Friends of yours, whom you fancy'd I shou'd in great Gravity have condemn'd. ending as abruptly as it did, and in a sort of Confusion; which almost brought all to nothing that had been advanc'd in the Discourse before. Some Particulars of this Conversation may not perhaps be so proper to commit to Paper. 'Tis enough that I put you in mind of the Conversation in general. A great many fine Schemes, it's true, were destroy'd; many grave Reasonings overturn'd: but this being done without Offence to the Partys concern'd, and with Improvement to the good Humour of the Company, it set the Appetite the keener to such Conversations. And I am persuaded, that had Reason herself been to judg of her own Interest, she wou'd have thought she receiv'd more Advantage in the main from that easy and familiar way, than from the usual stiff Adherence to a particular Opinion. earnest. You may continue to tell me, I affect to be paradoxical, in commending a Conversation as advantageous to Reason, which ended in such an Uncertainty of all that Reason had seemingly so well establish'd. neither the written Treatises of the Learned, nor the set Discourses of the Eloquent, are able of themselves to teach the use of it. 'Tis the Habit alone of Reasoning that can make a Reasoner . And Men can never be better invited to the Habit, than when they find Pleasure in it. A Freedom of Raillery, a Liberty in decent Language to question every thing, and an Allowance of unravelling or refuting any Argument, without offence to the Arguer, are the only Terms which can render such speculative Conversations any way agreeable. For to say truth; they have been render'd burdensom to Mankind by the Strictness of the Laws prescrib'd to 'em, and by the prevailing Pedantry and Bigotry of those who reign in 'em, and assume to themselves to be Dictators in these Provinces. 13 Divinity, in Morals, and in Philosophy, as it was of old, the Satyrist's , in Poetry. Vicissitude is a mighty Law of Discourse, and mightily long'd for by Mankind. In matter of Reason, more is done in a minute or two, by way of Question and Reply, than by a continu'd Discourse of whole Hours. Orations are fit only to move the Passions: And the Power of Declamation is to terrify, exalt, ravish, or delight, rather than satisfy or instruct. A free Conference is a close Fight. The other Way, in comparison to it, is but a Brandishing, or Beating the Air . To be obstructed therefore and manacled in Conferences, and to be confin'd to hear Orations on certain Subjects, must needs give us a Distast, and render the Subjects so manag'd, as disagreeable as the Managers. Men had rather reason upon Trifles, so they may reason freely, and without the Imposition of Authority, than on the usefullest and best Subjects in the World, where they are held under a Restraint and Fear. so little to argue strictly on any trivial Subject in Company; when they dare so little exert their Reason in greater Matters, and are forc'd to argue lamely, where they have need of the greatest Activity and Strength. The same thing therefore happens here as in strong and healthy Bodys, which are debar'd their natural Exercise, and confin'd in a narrow Space. They are forc'd to use odd Gestures and Contortions. They have a sort of Action, and move still, tho with the worst Grace imaginable. For the animal Spirits in such sound and active Limbs cannot lie dead, or without Employment. And thus the natural free Spirits of ingenious Men, if imprison'd and controul'd, will find out other ways of Motion to relieve themselves in their Constraint : and whether it be in Burlesque, Mimickry or Buffoonery, they will be glad at any rate to vent themselves, and be reveng'd on their Constrainers. will do it ironically. If they are forbid to speak at all upon such Subjects, or if they find it really dangerous for 'em to do so; they will then redouble their Disguise, involve themselves in Mysteriousness, and talk so as hardly to be understood, or at least not plainly interpreted, by those who are dispos'd to do 'em a mischief. And thus Raillery is brought more in fashion, and runs into an Extreme. 'Tis the persecuting Spirit has rais'd the bantering one: And want of Liberty may account for want of a true Politeness, and for the Corruption or wrong Use of Pleasantry and Humour. and are apt sometimes to take a Buffooning Rustick Air, we may thank the ridiculous Solemnity and four Humour of our Pedagogues : or rather they may thank themselves, if they in particular meet with the heaviest of this kind of Treatment. For it will naturally fall heaviest, where the Constraint has been the severest. The greater the Weight is, the bitterer will be the Satyr. The higher the Slavery, the more exquisite the Buffoonery. spiritual Tyranny is highest. For the greatest of Buffoons are the their Theatres, and in their Streets, Buffoonery and Burlesque are in the highest vogue. 'Tis the only manner in which the poor cramp'd Wretches can discharge a free Thought. We must yield to 'em the Superiority in this sort of Wit. For what wonder is it if we, who have more of Liberty, have less Dexterity in that egregious way of Raillery and Ridicule? little of this Spirit, and that there is hardly such a thing found as mere Burlesque in any Authors of the politer Ages. The manner indeed in which they treated the very gravest Subjects, was somewhat different from that of our Days. Their Treatises were generally in a free and familiar Stile. They chose to give us the Representation of real Discourse and Converse, by treating their Subjects in the way of  14 Dialogue and free Debate. The Scene was usually laid at Table, or in the publick Walks or Meeting-places; and the usual Wit and Humour of their real Discourses appear'd in those of their own composing. And this was fair. For without Wit and Humour, Reason can hardly have its proof, or be distinguish'd. The Magisterial Voice and high Strain of the Pedagogue, commands Reverence and Awe. 'Tis of admirable use to keep Understandings at a distance, and out of reach. The other Manner, on the contrary, gives the fairest hold, and suffers an Antagonist to use his full Strength hand to hand, upon even ground. cope with his Author, who is willing to come on a fair Stage with him, and exchange the Tragick Buskin for an easier and more natural Gate and Habit. Grimace and Tone are mighty Helps to Imposture. And many a formal Piece of Sophistry holds proof under a severe Brow, which wou'd not pass under an easy one. 'Twas the Saying of  15 an antient Sage, "That Humour was the only Test of Gravity; and Gravity of Humour. For a Subject that wou'd not bear Raillery, was suspicious; and a Jest that wou'd not bear a serious Examination, was certainly false Wit." false Zeal , that when they hear Principles examin'd, Sciences and Arts inquir'd into, and Matters of Importance treated with this frankness of Humour, they imagine presently that all Professions must fall to the ground, all Establishments come to ruin, and nothing orderly or decent be left standing in the World. They fear, or pretend to fear, that Religion it-self will be endanger'd by this free Way; and are therefore as much alarm'd at this Liberty in private Conversation, and under prudent Management, as if it were grosly us'd in publick Company, or before the solemnest Assembly. But the Case, as I apprehend it, is far different. For you are to remember (my Friend!) that I am writing to you in defence only of the Liberty of the Club , and of that sort of Freedom which is taken amongst Gentlemen and Friends , who know one another perfectly well. And that 'tis natural for me to defend Liberty with this restriction, you may infer from the very Notion I have of Liberty it-self. to take the Chair who is not call'd to it. To start Questions, or manage Debates, which offend the Publick Ear, is to be wanting in that Respect which is due to common Society. Such Subjects shou'd either not be treated at all in publick, or in such a manner as to occasion no Scandal or Disturbance. The Publick is not, on any account, to be laugh'd at, to its face; or so reprehended for its Follys, as to make it think it-self contemn'd. And what is contrary to good Breeding, is in this respect as contrary to Liberty. It belongs to Men of slavish Principles, to affect a Superiority over the Vulgar , and to despise the Multitude . The Lovers of Mankind respect and honour Conventions and Societys of Men. And in mix'd Company, and Places where Men are met promiscuously on account of Diversion or Affairs, 'tis an Imposition and Hardship to force 'em to hear what they dislike, and to treat of Matters in a Dialect, which many who are present have perhaps been never us'd to. 'Tis a breach of the Harmony of publick Conversation, to take things in such a Key, as is above the common Reach, puts others to silence, and robs them of their Privilege of Turn . But as to private Society, and what passes in select Companys, where Friends meet knowingly, and with that very design of exercising their Wit, and looking freely into all Subjects; I see no pretence for any one to be offended at the way of Raillery and Humour, which is the very Life of such Conversations; the only thing which makes good Company, and frees it from the Formality of Business, and the Tutorage and Dogmaticalness of the Schools. Conversations are apt to run chiefly upon Trifles; if rational Discourses (especially those of a deeper Speculation) have lost their Credit, and are in disgrace because of their Formality ; there is reason for more Allowance in the way of Humour and Gaiety . An easier Method of treating these Subjects, will make 'em more agreeable and familiar. To dispute about 'em, will be the same as about other Matters. They need not spoil good Company, or take from the Ease or Pleasure of a polite Conversation. And the oftner these Conversations are renew'd, the better will be their Effect. We shall grow better Reasoners , by reasoning pleasantly, and at our ease; taking up, or laying down these Subjects as we fancy. So that upon the whole, I must own to you, I cannot be scandaliz'd at the Raillery you took notice of, nor at the Effect it had upon our Company. The Humour was agreeable, and the pleasant Confusion which the Conversation ended in, is at this time as pleasant to me upon Reflection; when I consider, that instead of being discourag'd from resuming the Debate, we were so much the readier to meet again at any time, and dispute upon the same Subjects, even with more Ease and Satisfaction than before. Morality and Religion . And amidst the different Opinions which were started and maintain'd by several of the Partys, with a great deal of Life and Ingenuity; one or other wou'd every now and then take the liberty to appeal to trial. No one but was assur'd Common Sense wou'd justify him. But when Issue was join'd, and the Cause examin'd at the Bar, there cou'd be no Judgment given. The Partys however were not less forward in renewing their Appeal, on the very next occasion that presented. No one wou'd offer to call the Authority of the Court in question; till a Gentleman, whose good Understanding was never yet doubted of, desir'd the Company very gravely, that they wou'd tell him what Common Sense was. " If by the word Sense we were to understand Opinion and Judgment, and by the word common the Generality or any considerable part of Mankind; 'twou'd be hard, he said, to discover where the Subject of common Sense cou'd lie. For that which was according to the Sense of one Part of Mankind, was against the Sense of another. And if the Majority were to determine common Sense, it wou'd change as often as Men chang'd. That which was according to common Sense to day, wou'd be the contrary to morrow, or soon after." there were some however in which 'twas suppos'd they all agreed, and had the same Thoughts in common. --- The Question was ask'd still, Where ? "For whatever was of any moment, 'twas suppos'd, might be reduc'd under the head of Religion, Policy , or Morals. " Of the Differences in Religion there was no occasion to speak; the Case was so fully known to all, and so feelingly understood by Christians, in particular, among themselves. They had made sound Experiment upon one another; each Party in their turn. No Endeavours had been wanting on the side of any particular Sect. Which-ever chanc'd to have the Power, fail'd not of putting all means in execution, to make their private Sense the publick one. But all in vain. Common Sense was as hard still to determine as Catholick or Orthodox. What with one was inconceivable Mystery, to another was of easy Comprehension. What to one was Absurdity, to another was Demonstration. " As for Policy ; What Sense or whose cou'd be call'd common, was equally a Question. If plain British or Dutch Sense were right, Turkish and French Sense must certainly be very wrong. And as mere Nonsense as Passive-Obedience seem'd; we found it to be the common Sense of a great Party amongst our-selves, a greater Party in Europe , and perhaps the greatest Part of all the World besides. " As for Morals ; The difference, if possible, was still wider. For without considering the Opinions and Customs of the many barbarous and illiterate Nations; we saw that even the few who had attain'd to riper Letters, and to Philosophy, cou'd never as yet agree on one and the same System, or acknowledg the same moral Principles. And some even of our most admir'd modern Philosophers had fairly told us, that Virtue and Vice had, after all, no other Law or Measure , than mere Fashion and Vogue ." only the graver Subjects in this manner; and suffer'd the lighter to escape. For in the gayer Part of Life, our Follys are as solemn as in the most serious. The fault is, we carry the Laugh but half-way . The false Earnest is ridicul'd, but the false Jest passes secure, and becomes as errant Deceit as the other. Our Diversions, our Plays, our Amusements become solemn . We dream of Happinesses, and Possessions, and Enjoyments in which we have no Understanding, no Certainty; and yet we pursue these as the best known and most certain things in the World. There is nothing so foolish and deluding as a partial Scepticism . For whilst the Doubt is cast only on one side, the Certainty grows so much stronger on the other. Whilst only one Face of Folly appears ridiculous, the other grows more solemn and deceiving. more ingenious, and fair in their way of questioning receiv'd Opinions, and exposing the Ridicule of Things. And if you will allow me to carry on their Humour, I will venture to make the Experiment throughout; and try what certain Knowledg or Assurance of things may be recover'd, in that very way, by which all Certainty, you thought, was lost, and an endless Scepticism introduc'd. and plac'd either at Paris or Venice at a time of Carnival, when the general Face of Mankind was disguis'd, and almost every Creature wore a Mask; 'tis probable he wou'd for some time be at a stand, before he discover'd the Cheat: not imagining that a whole People cou'd be so fantastical, as upon Agreement, at an appointed time, to transform themselves by a Variety of Habits, and make it a solemn Practice to impose on one another, by this universal Confusion of Characters and Persons. Tho he might at first perhaps have look'd on this with a serious Eye, it wou'd be hardly possible for him to hold his Countenance, when he had perceiv'd what was carrying on. The Europeans , on their side, might laugh perhaps at this Simplicity. But our Ethiopian wou'd certainly laugh with better reason. 'Tis easy to see which of the two wou'd be ridiculous. For he who laughs, and is himself ridiculous, bears a double share of Ridicule. However, shou'd it so happen, that in the Transport of Ridicule our Ethiopian , having his Head still running upon Masks , and knowing nothing of the fair Complexion and common Dress of the Europeans , shou'd upon the sight of a natural Face and Habit, laugh just as heartily as before; wou'd not he in his turn become ridiculous, by carrying the Jest too far; when by a silly Presumption he took Nature for mere Art , and mistook perhaps a Man of Sobriety and Sense for one of those ridiculous Mummers ? Behaviour. Their Opinions were left to themselves. They had Liberty to differ in these, as in their Faces. Every one took the Air and Look which was natural to him. But in process of time, it was thought decent to mend Mens Countenances, and render their intellectual Complexions uniform and of a sort. Thus the Magistrate became a Dresser , and in his turn was dress'd too, as he deserv'd; when he had given up his Power to a new Order of Tire- Men . But tho it was agreed that there was only one certain and true Dress , one single peculiar Air , to which it was necessary all People shou'd conform; yet the Misery was, that neither the Magistrate nor the Tire- Men themselves, cou'd resolve, which of the various Modes was the exact true one . Imagine now, what the Effect of this must needs be; when Men became persecuted thus on every side about their Air and Feature , and were put to their shifts how to adjust and compose their Mein , according to the right Mode; when a thousand Models, a thousand Patterns of Dress were current, and alter'd every now and then, upon occasion, according to Fashion and the Humour of the Times. Judg whether Mens Countenances were not like to grow constrain'd, and the natural Visage of Mankind, by this Habit, distorted, convuls'd, and render'd hardly knowable. render'd by this unhappy Care of Dress , and Over-Tenderness for the Safety of Complexions ; we must not therefore imagine that all Faces are alike besmear'd or plaister'd. All is not Fucus , or mere Varnish. Nor is the Face of Truth less fair and beautiful, for all the counterfeit Vizards which have been put upon her. We must remember the Carnival , and what the Occasion has been of this wild Concourse and Medly: who were the Institutors of it: and to what purpose Men were thus set awork and amus'd. We may laugh sufficiently at the original Cheat; and, if pity will suffer us, we may make our-selves diversion enough with the Folly and Madness of those who are thus caught, and practis'd on, by these Impostures. But we must remember withal our become more ridiculous than the People whom we ridicule. And if a Jest or Ridicule thus strain'd, be capable of leading the Judgment so far astray; 'tis probable that an Excess of Fear or Horrour may work the same Effect. time when the  16 you wou'd have had a detestation of the Act: And perhaps the very Persons of the Men might have grown so odious to you, that after all the Cheats and Abuses they had committed, you might have seen 'em dispatch'd with as relentless an eye as our later European Ancestors saw the Destruction of a like politick Body of Conjurers, the Knights Templars ; who were almost become an Over-Match for the Civil Sovereign. Your Indignation perhaps might have carry'd you to propose the razing all Monuments and Memorials of these Magicians. You might have resolv'd not to leave so much as their Houses standing. But if it had happen'd that these Magicians, in the time of their Dominion, had made any Collection of Books, or had compil'd any themselves, in which they had treated of Philosophy , or Morals , or any other Science, or Part of Learning ; wou'd you have carry'd your Resentment so far as to have extirpated these also, and condemn'd every Opinion or Doctrine, which they had espous'd, for no other reason than merely because they had espous'd it ? Hardly a Scythian , a Tartar , or a Goth , wou'd act or reason so absurdly. Much less wou'd you (my Friend!) have carry'd on this Magophony , or Priest-Massacre , with such a barbarous Zeal. For, in good earnest, to destroy a Philosophy in hatred to a Man, implies as errant a Tartar -Notion, as to destroy or murder a Man in order to plunder him of his Wit, and get the Inheritance of his Understanding. I Must confess indeed, that had the Institutions, the Statutes, and Regulations of this antient Hierarchy , been all of 'em resembling the  17 fundamental one, of the Order it-self, they might with a great deal of Justice have been suppress'd: For one can't without some abhorrence read that Law of theirs; Nam Magus ex Matre & Gnato gignatur oportet. Catull. 87. ought in their Principle to appear as fair as possible to the World, the better to conceal their Practice , found it highly for their Interest to espouse some excellent moral Rules, and establish the very best Maxims of this kind. They thought it for their advantage perhaps, on their first setting out, to recommend the greatest Purity of Religion, the greatest Integrity of Life and Manners. They may perhaps too, in general, have preach'd up Charity and Good-will. They may have set to view the fairest Face of Human Nature; and together with their By-Laws, and Political Institutions, have interwove the honestest Morals and best Doctrine in the World. How therefore shou'd we have behav'd our-selves in this Affair? How shou'd we have carry'd our-selves towards this Order of Men, at the time of the Discovery of their Cheat, and Ruin of their Empire? Shou'd we have fall'n to work instantly with their Systems, struck at their Opinions and Doctrines without distinction, and erected a contrary Philosophy in their teeth? Shou'd we have flown at every religious and moral Principle, deny'd every natural and social Affection, and render'd Men as much Wolves as was possible to one another, whilst we describ'd 'em such; and endeavour'd to make them see themselves by far more monstrous and corrupt, than with the worst Intentions it was ever possible for the worst of 'em to become? --- This, you'l say, doubtless wou'd have been a very preposterous Part, and cou'd never have been acted but by mean Spirits, such as had been held in awe, and  18 over-frighted by the Magi. able and witty Philosopher of our Nation was, we know, of late Years, so possess'd with a Horrour of this kind, that both with respect to Politicks and Morals, he directly acted in this Spirit of Massacre . The Fright he took upon the Sight of the then governing Powers, who unjustly assum'd the Authority of the People, gave him such an Abhorrence of all popular Government, and of the very Notion of Liberty it-self; that to extinguish it for ever, he recommends the very extinguishing of Letters, and exhorts Princes not to spare so much as an antient Roman or Greek Historian. --- Is not this in truth somewhat Gothick ? And has not our Philosopher, in appearance, something of the Savage , that he shou'd use Philosophy and Learning as the Scythians are said to have us'd learnt the Manners of a polite People? Times gave him the same Terror in this other kind. He had nothing before his Eyes but the Ravage of Enthusiasm , and the Artifice of those, who rais'd and conducted that Spirit. And the good sociable Man, as savage and unsociable as he wou'd make himself and all Mankind appear by his Philosophy, expos'd himself during his Life, and took the utmost Pains, that after his Death we might be deliver'd from the occasion of these Terrors. He did his utmost to shew us, that both in Religion and Morals we were impos'd on by our Governors; that there was nothing which by Nature inclin'd us either way; nothing which naturally drew us to the Love of what was without, or beyond our-selves . Tho the Love of such great Truths and sovereign Maxims as he imagin'd these to be, made him the most laborious of all Men in composing Systems of this kind for our Use; and forc'd him, notwithstanding his natural Fear, to run continually the highest Risk of being a Martyr for our Deliverance. Seriousness, and assure you, that there is no such mighty Danger as we are apt to imagine from these fierce Prosecutors of Superstition, who are so jealous of every religious or moral Principle. Whatever Savages they may appear in Philosophy, they are in their common Capacity as Civil Persons, as one can wish. Their free communicating of their Principles may witness for them. 'Tis the height of Sociableness to be thus friendly and communicative. they might become considerable. Things are often made so, by being kept as Secrets of a Sect or Party: and nothing helps this more than the Antipathy and Shyness of a contrary Party. If we fall presently into Horrors, and Consternation, upon the hearing Maxims which are thought poisonous ; we are in no Disposition to use that familiar and easy Part of Reason, which is the best Antidote . The only Poison to Reason, is Passion . For false Reasoning is soon redress'd, where Passion is remov'd. But if the very hearing certain Propositions of Philosophy is sufficient to move our Passion; 'tis plain, the Poison has already gain'd on us, and we are effectually prevented in the use of our reasoning Faculty. diverting our-selves with the Fancy of one of these modern Reformers we have been speaking of? What shou'd we say to one of these Anti-Zealots , who, in the Zeal of such a cool Philosophy, shou'd assure us faithfully, "That we were the most mistaken men in the World, to imagine there was any such Thing as natural Faith or Justice? For that it was only Force and Power which constituted Right . That there was no such thing in reality as Virtue ; no Principle of Order in things above, or below; no secret Charm or Force of Nature, by which every one was made to operate willingly or unwillingly towards publick Good, and punish'd, and tormented if he did otherwise." --- Is not this the very Charm it-self? Is not the Gentleman at this instant under the power of it? --- "Sir! The Philosophy you have condescended to reveal to us, is most extraordinary. We are beholden to you for your Instruction. But, pray, whence is this Zeal in our behalf? What are We to You ? Are You our Father ? Or if You were, why this Concern for Us? Is there then such a thing as natural Affection ? If not; why all this Pains, why all this Danger on our account? Why not keep this Secret to Your-self? Of what Advantage is it to You, to deliver us from the Cheat? The more are taken in it, the better. 'Tis directly against Your Interest to undeceive Us, and let us know that only private Interest governs You, and that nothing nobler, or of a larger kind, shou'd govern us, whom you converse with. Leave us to our-selves, and to that notable Art by which we are happily tam'd, and render'd thus mild and sheepish . 'Tis not fit we shou'd know that by Nature we are all Wolves . Is it possible that one who has really discover'd himself such, shou'd take pains to communicate such a Discovery?" when we are put thus upon the Defence of common Honesty , by such fair honest Gentlemen, who are in Practice so different from what they wou'd appear in Speculation. Knaves I know there are in Notion and Principle , as well as in Practice : who think all Honesty as well as Religion a mere Cheat; and, by a very consistent reasoning, have resolv'd deliberately to do all that by Power or Art they are able, for their private Advantage. But such as these never open themselves in Friendship to others. They have no such Passion for Truth, or Love for Mankind. They have no Quarrel with Religion or Morals ; but know what Use to make of both, upon occasion. If they discover their Principles, 'tis never but at unawares. They are sure to preach Honesty, and go to Church. be call'd Hypocrites . They speak as ill of themselves as they possibly can. If they have hard Thoughts of Human Nature; 'tis a Proof still of their Humanity, that they give such Warning to the World. If they represent Men by Nature treacherous and wild , 'tis out of Care for Mankind; lest by being too tame and trusting , they shou'd easily be caught. easier abuse it. These Gentlemen, on the contrary, speak the worst; and had rather they themselves shou'd be censur'd with the rest, than that a Few shou'd by Imposture prevail over the Many . For 'tis Opinion of Goodness that creates Easiness of Trust: and by Trust we are betray'd to Power ; our very Reason being thus captivated by those in whom we come insensibly to have an implicit Faith . But supposing one another to be by Nature such very Savages , we shall take care to come less in one another's Power: and apprehending Power to be insatiably coveted by all , we shall the better sence against the Evil; not by giving all into one hand (as the Champion of this Cause wou'd have us) but, on the contrary, by a right Division and Ballance of Power, and by the Restraint of good Laws and Limitations, which may secure the publick Liberty. fully persuaded of the Principles they so often advance in Company? I shou'd tell you, That tho I wou'd not absolutely arraign the Gentlemens Sincerity; yet there was something of Mystery in the Case, more than was imagin'd. The Reason, perhaps, why Men of Wit delight so much to espouse these paradoxical Systems, is not in truth that they are so fully satisfy'd with 'em; but that they may the better oppose some other Systems, which by their fair Appearance have help'd, they think, to bring Mankind under Subjection. They imagine that by this general Scepticism , which they wou'd introduce, they shall better deal with the dogmatical Spirit which prevails in some particular Subjects . And when they have accustom'd Men to bear Contradiction in the main , and hear the Nature of Things disputed of, at large ; it may be safer (they conclude) to argue separately , upon certain nice Points in which they are not altogether so well satisfy'd. So that from hence, perhaps, you may still better apprehend why, in Conversation, the Spirit of Raillery prevails so much, and Notions are taken up for no reason besides their being odd , and out of the way. am in no such apprehension from this sceptical kind of Wit. Men indeed may, in a serious way, be so wrought on, and confounded, by different Modes of Opinion, different Systems and Schemes impos'd by Authority , that they may wholly lose all Notion or Comprehension of Truth . I can easily apprehend what Effect Awe has over Mens Understandings. I can very well suppose Men may be frighted out of their Wits: But I have no apprehension they shou'd be laugh'd out of 'em. I can hardly imagine that in a pleasant way they shou'd ever be talk'd out of their Love for Society, or reason'd out of Humanity and common Sense . A mannerly Wit can hurt no Cause or Interest for which I am in the least concern'd: And Philosophical Speculations, politely manag'd, can never surely render Mankind more unsociable or unciviliz'd. This is not the Quarter from whence I can possibly expect an Inroad of Savageness and Barbarity. And by the best of my Observation, I have learnt, that Virtue is never such a Sufferer by being contested , as by being betray'd . My Fear is not so much from its witty Antagonists , who give it Exercise, and put it on its Defence, as from its tender Nurses , who are apt to over-lay it, and kill it, with Excess of Care and Cherishing. I Have known a Building, which by the Officiousness of the Workmen has been so shor'd , and screw'd up , on the side where they pretended it had a Leaning, that it has at last been turn'd the contrary way, and overthrown. There has something, perhaps, of this kind happen'd in Morals . Men have not been contented to shew the natural Advantages of Honesty and Virtue. They have rather lessen'd these, the better, as they thought, to advance another Foundation. They have made Virtue so mercenary a thing, and have talk'd so much of its Rewards , that one can hardly tell what there is in it, after all, that can be worth rewarding. For to be brib'd only or terrify'd into an honest Practice, bespeaks little of real Honesty or Worth. We may make, it's true, whatever Bargain we think fit; and may bestow in favour what Overplus we please. But there can be no Excellence or Wisdom in voluntarily rewarding what is neither estimable, nor deserving. And if Virtue be not really estimable in it-self, I can see nothing estimable in following it for the sake of a Bargain. Inclination; I know not how there can possibly be such a thing as Goodness or Virtue . If the Inclination be right ; 'tis a perverting of it, to apply it solely to the Reward , and make us conceive such Wonders of the Grace and Favour that is to attend Virtue; when there is so little shewn of the intrinsick Worth or Value of the Thing it-self. most Heroick Virtues have so little notice taken of 'em in our Holy Religion, is, because there wou'd have been no room left for Disinterestedness , had they been intitled to a share of that infinite Reward, which Providence has by Revelation assign'd to other Dutys.  20 Private Friendship , and Zeal for the Publick, and our Country , are Virtues purely voluntary in a Christian. They are no essential Parts of his Charity . He is not so ty'd to the Affairs of this Life; nor is he oblig'd to enter into such Engagements with this lower World, as are of no help to him in acquiring a better. His Conversation is in Heaven. Nor has he occasion for such supernumerary Cares or Embarassments here on Earth, as may obstruct his way thither, or retard him in the careful Task of working out his own Salvation. If nevertheless any Portion of Reward be reserv'd hereafter for the generous Part of a Patriot , or that of a thorow Friend ; this is still behind the Curtain, and happily conceal'd from us; that we may be the more deserving of it, when it comes. Virtues had their illustrious Examples, and were in some manner recommended to us as honourable, and worthy our Imitation. Even Saul himself, as ill a Prince as he is represented, appears both living and dying to have been respected and prais'd for the Love he bore his native Country. And the Love which was so remarkable between his Son and his Successor, gives us a noble View of a disinterested Friendship, at least on one side. But the heroick Virtue of these Persons had only the common Reward of Praise attributed to it, and cou'd not claim a future Recompence under a Religion which taught no future State, nor exhibited any Rewards or Punishments, besides such as were Temporal, and had respect to the written Law. to be instructed in the sublime part of Virtue, and induc'd by Reason to that which was not injoin'd 'em by Command. No Premium or Penalty being inforc'd in these Cases, the disinterested Part subsisted, the Virtue was a free Choice , and the Magnanimity of the Act was left intire. He that wou'd be generous, had the Means. He that wou'd frankly serve his Friend, or Country, at the  21 expence even of his Life, might do it on fair Terms. Dulce et decorum est was his sole Reason. 'Twas Inviting and Becoming . 'Twas Good and Honest . And that this is still a good Reason, and according to Common Sense , I will endeavour to satisfy you. For I shou'd think my-self very ridiculous to be angry with any one for thinking me dishonest; if I cou'd give no account of my Honesty, nor shew upon what Principle I differ'd from a Knave. speaking of the Nobility and Court , he is so far from allowing them to be the Standard of Politeness and good Sense, that he makes 'em in a manner the Reverse. Rarus enim ferme Sensus communis in ill a Fortun a \--- Juv. Sat. 8\. v. 73\. Some of the  22 most ingenious Commentators, however, interpret this very differently from what is generally apprehended. They make this Common Sense of the Poet's, by a Greek Derivation, to signify Sense of Publick Weal , and of the Common Interest ; Love of the Community or Society , Natural Affection, Humanity, Obligingness, or that sort of Civility which rises from a just Sense of the common Rights of Mankind, and the natural Equality there is amongst those of the same Species. the Poet, to have deny'd Wit or Ability to a Court such as that of Rome , even under a Tiberius or a Nero . But for Humanity , or Sense of Publick Good , and the common Interest of Mankind, 'twas no such deep Satyr to question whether this was properly the Spirit of a Court . 'Twas difficult to apprehend what Community subsisted among Courtiers; or what Publick between an Absolute Prince and his Slave- Subjects. And for real Society , there cou'd be none between such as had no other Sense than that of private Good. it is the Heart , rather than the Head , he takes to task: when reflecting on a Court -Education, he thinks it unapt to raise any Affection towards a Country ; and looks upon young Princes, and Lords, as the young Masters of the World; who being indulg'd in all their Passions, and train'd up in all manner of Licentiousness, have that thorow Contempt and Disregard of Mankind, which Mankind in a manner deserves, where Arbitrary Power is permitted, and a Tyranny ador'd. H aec satis ad Juvenem, quem nobis fama superbum Tradit, & inflatum, plenumque Nerone propinquo. Juv. Sat. 8\. A Publick Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or Sense of Partnership with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being Partners in this Sense , or Sharers in this common Affection , as they who scarcely know an Equal , nor consider themselves as subject to any Law of Fellowship or Community . And thus Morality and good Government go together. There is no real Love of Virtue, without the Knowledg of Publick Good . And where Absolute Power is, there is no Publick. Sacred and Divine, are debauch'd as much in their Religion, as in their Morals. Publick Good , according to their Apprehension, is as little the Measure or Rule of Government in the Universe , as in the State . They have scarce a Notion of what is Good or Just, other than as mere Will and Power have determin'd. Omnipotence, they think, wou'd hardly be it-self, were it not at liberty to dispense with the Laws of Equity, and change at pleasure the Standard of moral Rectitude. plain there is something still of a publick Principle , even where it is most perverted and depress'd. The worst of Magistracys, the mere Despotick kind , can shew sufficient Instances of Zeal and Affection towards it. Where no other Government is known, it seldom fails of having that Allegiance and Duty paid it, which is owing to a better Form. The Eastern Countrys, and many barbarous Nations, have been and still are Examples of this kind. The personal Love they bear their Prince, however severe towards them, may shew how natural an Affection there is towards Government and Order among Mankind. If Men have really no publick Parent, no Magistrate in common, to cherish and protect 'em, they will still imagine they have such a one; and, like new-born Creatures that have never seen their Dam, will fancy one for themselves, and apply (as by Nature prompted) to some like Form, for Favour and Protection. In the room of a true Foster-Father , and Chief , they will take after a false one ; and in the room of a legal Government and just Prince , obey even a Tyrant , and endure a whole Lineage and Succession of such. Government deliver'd to us from our Ancestors. We have the Notion of A Executive is model'd. We understand Weight and Measure in this kind, and can reason justly on the Ballance of Power and Property . The Maxims we draw from hence, are as evident as those in Mathematicks . Our increasing Knowledg shews us every day, more and more, what Common Sense is in Politicks: And this must of necessity lead us to understand a like Sense in Morals; which is the Foundation. honestly, in a form'd Government; and not in that which is commonly call'd  23 the State of Nature . For, to speak in the fashionable Language of our modern Philosophy: "Society being founded on a Compact; the Surrender made of every Man's private unlimited Right, into the hands of the Majority, or such as the Majority shou'd appoint, was of free Choice, and by a Promise." Now the Promise it-self was made in the State of Nature : And that which cou'd make a Promise obligatory in the State of Nature, must make all other Acts of Humanity as much our real Duty, and natural Part. Thus Faith, Justice, Honesty and Virtue , must have been as early as the State of Nature, or they cou'd never have been at all . The Civil Union, or Confederacy, cou'd never make Right or Wrong ; if they subsisted not before. He who was free to any Villany before his Contract, will, and ought to make as free with his Contract, when he thinks fit. The natural Knave has the same Reason to be a Civil one ; and may dispense with his Politick Capacity as oft as he sees occasion: 'Tis only his Word stands in his way.---A Man is oblig'd to keep his Word . Why? Because he has given his Word to keep it .---Is not this a notable Account of the Original of moral Justice, and the Rise of Civil Government and Allegiance! Nature with so little Meaning; we may with Justice surely place it as a Principle, "That if any thing be natural , in any Creature, or any Kind; 'tis that which is Preservative of the Kind it-self, and conducing to its Welfare and Support." If in original and pure Nature, it be Wrong to break a Promise, or be treacherous; 'tis as truly Wrong to be in any respect inhuman, or any way wanting in our natural part towards Human Kind. If Eating and Drinking be natural, Herding is so too. If any Appetite or Sense be natural, the Sense of Fellowship is the same. If there be any thing of Nature in that Affection which is between the Sexes, the Affection is certainly as natural towards the consequent Offspring; and so again between the Offspring themselves, as Kindred and Companions, bred under the same Discipline and Oeconomy. And thus a Clan or Tribe is gradually form'd; a Publick is recogniz'd: and besides the Pleasure found in social Entertainment, Language, and Discourse, there is so apparent a Necessity for continuing this good Correspondency and Union, that to have no Sense or Feeling of this kind, no Love of Country, Community , or any thing in common , wou'd be the same as to be insensible even of the plainest Means of Self-Preservation , and most necessary Condition of Self-Enjoyment. Government and Society appear a kind of Invention, and Creature of Art, I know not. For my own part, methinks, this herding Principle, and associating Inclination, is seen so natural and strong in most Men, that one might readily affirm, 'twas even from the Violence of this Passion that so much Disorder arose in the general Society of Mankind. remote Philosophical Object. That greater Community falls not easily under the Eye. Nor is a National Interest, or that of a whole People, or Body Politick, so readily apprehended. In less Partys, Men may be intimately conversant and acquainted with one another. They can there better taste Society, and enjoy the common Good and Interest of a more contracted Publick. They view the whole Compass and Extent of their Community; and see, and know particularly whom 'tis they serve, and to what end they associate and conspire . All Men have naturally their share of this combining Principle: and they who are of the sprightliest and most active Facultys, have so large a share of it, that unless it be happily directed by right Reason, it can never find Exercise for it-self in so remote a Sphere as that of the Body Politick at large. For here perhaps the thousandth part of those whose Interests are concern'd, are scarce so much as known by sight. No visible Band is form'd; no strict Alliance: but the Conjunction is made with different Persons, Orders, and Ranks of Men; not sensibly, but in Idea : according to that general View or Notion of a State or Commonwealth. Sympathy and conspiring Virtue is apt to lose it-self, for want of Direction, in so wide a Field. Nor is the Passion any where so strongly felt, or vigorously exerted, as in actual Conspiracy or War ; in which the highest Genius's are often known the forwardest to employ themselves. For the most generous Spirits are the most combining, and delight most to move in Concert, and feel (if I may say so) in the strongest manner, the force of the confederating Charm. savage, shou'd be the Passion of the most Heroick Spirits. But 'tis in War that the Knot of Fellowship is closest drawn. 'Tis in War that mutual Succour is most given, mutual Danger run, and common Affection most exerted and employ'd. For Heroism and Philanthropy are almost one and the same. Yet by a small misguidance of the Affection, a Lover of Mankind becomes a Ravager: A Hero and Deliverer becomes an Oppressor and Destroyer. Government, that Love of Party , and Subdivision, by Cabal . For Sedition is a kind of cantonizing already begun within the State. To cantonize is natural; when the Society grows vast, and bulky: And powerful States have found other Advantages in sending Colonys Abroad, than merely that of having Elbow-room at Home, or extending their Dominion into distant Countrys. Vast Empires are in many respects unnatural: but particularly in this, that be they ever so well constituted, the Affairs of many must, in such Governments, turn upon a very few; and the Relation be less sensible, and in a manner lost, between the Magistrate and People, in a Body so unweildy in its Limbs, and whose Members lie so remote from one another, and distant from the Head. The associating Spirits, for want of Exercise, form new Movements, and seek a narrower Sphere of Activity, when they want Action in a greater. Thus we have Wheels within Wheels . And in some National Constitutions (notwithstanding the Absurdity in Politicks) we have one Empire within another . Nothing is so delightful as to incorporate. Distinctions of many kinds are invented. Religious Societys are form'd. Orders are erected; and their Interests espous'd, and serv'd, with the utmost Zeal and Passion. Founders and Patrons of this sort are never wanting. Wonders are perform'd, in this wrong social Spirit, by those Members of separate Societys. And the associating Genius of Man is never better prov'd, than in those very Societys, which are form'd in opposition to the general one of Mankind, and to the real Interest of the State. be no other than the Abuse or Irregularity of that social Love , and common Affection, which is natural to Mankind. For the Opposite of Sociableness is Selfishness . And of all Characters, the thorow-selfish one is the least forward in taking Party . The Men of this sort are, in this respect, true Men of Moderation . They are secure of their Temper; and possess themselves too well, to be in danger of entring warmly into any Cause, or engaging deeply with any Side or Faction. the World . But, I believe, whoever looks narrowly into the Affairs of it, will find, that Passion, Humour, Caprice, Zeal, Faction , and a thousand other Springs, which are counter to Self-Interest , have as considerable a part in the Movements of this Machine. There are more Wheels and Counter- Poises in this Engine than are easily imagin'd. 'Tis of too complex a kind, to fall under one simple View, or be explain'd thus briefly in a word or two. The Studiers of this Mechanism must have a very partial Eye, to overlook all other Motions besides those of the lowest and narrowest Compass. 'Tis hard, that in the Plan or Description of this Clock-work, no Wheel or Ballance shou'd be allow'd on the side of the better and more enlarg'd Affections; that nothing shou'd be understood to be done in Kindness or Generosity ; nothing in pure good-Nature or Friendship , or thro any social or natural Affection of any kind: when, perhaps, the main Springs of this Machine will be found to be either these very natural Affections themselves, or a compound kind deriv'd from them, and retaining more than one half of their Nature. formal  24 Scheme of the Passions , or pretend to shew you their Genealogy and Relation ; how they are interwoven with one another, or interfere with our Happiness and Interest. 'Twou'd be out of the Genius and Compass of such a Letter as this, to frame a just Plan or Model ; by which you might, with an accurate View, observe what Proportion the friendly and natural Affections seem to bear in this Order of Architecture. natural Materials; and wou'd fain build after a more uniform way. They wou'd newframe the Human Heart; and have a mighty Fancy to reduce all its Motions, Ballances and Weights, to that one Principle and Foundation of a cool and deliberate Selfishness . Men, it seems, are unwilling to think they can be so outwitted, and impos'd on by Nature, as to be made to serve her Purposes, rather than their own. They are asham'd to be drawn thus out of themselves , and forc'd from what they esteem their true Interest. thought to set this Difference to rights, by conquering Nature in themselves. A Primitive Father and Founder among these, saw well this Power of Nature , and understood it so far, that he earnestly exhorted his Followers neither to beget Children, nor serve their Country. There was no dealing with Nature, it seems, while these alluring Objects stood in the way. Relations, Friends, Countrymen, Laws, Politick Constitutions, the Beauty of Order and Government , and the Interest of Society and Mankind , were Objects which, he well saw, wou'd naturally raise a stronger Affection than any that was grounded upon the narrow bottom of mere Self. His Advice, therefore, not to marry, nor engage at all in the Publick, was wise, and sutable to his Design. There was no way to be truly a Disciple of this Philosophy, but to leave Family, Friends, Country, and Society, to cleave to it .---And, in good earnest, who wou'd not, if it were Happiness to do so?---The Philosopher, however, was kind , in telling us his Thought. 'Twas a Token of his Fatherly Love of Mankind. Tu Pater, &rerum Inventor! Tu Patria nobis Suppeditas proecepta !---Lucret. lib. 3\. lower Genius. They seem to have understood less of this force of Nature, and have thought to alter the Thing , by shifting a Name . They wou'd so explain all the social Passions, and natural Affections, as to denominate 'em of the selfish kind . Thus Civility, Hospitality, Humanity towards Strangers or People in Distress, is but a more deliberate Selfishness . An honest Heart is only a more cunning one : and Honesty and Good-Nature, a more deliberate , or better regulated Self-Love . The Love of Kindred, Children and Posterity, is purely Love of Self , and of one's own immediate Blood : As if, by this Reckoning, all Mankind were not included; All being of one Blood , and join'd by Inter-Marriages and Alliances; as they have been transplanted in Colonys, and mix'd one with another. And thus Love of one's Country , and Love of Mankind , must also be Self-Love. Magnanimity and Courage , no doubt, are Modifications of this universal Self-Love For 25 Courage (says our modern Philosopher) is constant Anger . And all Men 26 (says a witty Poet) wou'd be Cowards if they durst. perhaps without dispute. They may have spoken the best of their Knowledg. But for true Courage , it has so little to do with Anger , that there is always the strongest Suspicion against it, where this Passion is highest. The true Courage is the cool and calm . The bravest of Men have the least of a brutal bullying Insolence; and in the very time of Danger are found the most serene, pleasant, and free. Rage, we know, can make a Coward forget himself and fight. But what is done in Fury , or Anger , can never be plac'd to the account of Courage . Were it otherwise, Womankind might claim to be the stoutest Sex: For their Hatred and Anger have ever been allow'd to be the strongest and most lasting. Distributers and petty Retailers of this Wit; who have run Changes, and Divisions, without end, upon this Article of Self-Love . You have the same Thought spun out a hundred ways, and drawn into Motto's, and Devises, to set forth this Riddle; That "act as disinterestedly or generously as you please, Self still is at the bottom, and nothing else." Now if these Gentlemen, who delight so much in the Play of Words, but are cautious how they grapple closely with Definitions, wou'd tell us only what Self-Interest was, and determine Happiness and Good , there wou'd be an end of this Enigmatical Wit. For in this we shou'd all agree, that Happiness was to be pursu'd, and in fact was always sought after: but whether found in following Nature , and giving way to common Affection; or in suppressing it, and turning every Passion towards private Advantage, a narrow Self -End, or the Preservation of mere Life ; this wou'd be the matter in debate between us. The Question wou'd not be, Who lov'd himself, or Who not : but who lov'd and serv'd himself the rightest , and after the truest manner. value Life , as far as Life is good, belongs as much to Courage as to Discretion. But a wretched Life is no wise Man's Wish. To be without Honesty , is, in effect, to be without natural Affection or Sociableness of any kind. And a Life without natural Affection, Friendship , or Sociableness , wou'd be found a wretched one, were it to be try'd. 'Tis as these Feelings and Affections are intrinsecally valuable and worthy, that Self-Interest is to be rated and esteem'd. A Man is by nothing so much himself , as by his Temper , and the Character of his Passions and Affections . If he loses what is manly and worthy in these, he is as much lost to himself as when he loses his Memory and Understanding. The least step into Villany or Baseness, changes the Character and Value of a Life. He who wou'd preserve Life at any rate, must abuse himself more than any one can abuse him. And if Life be not a dear Thing indeed, he who has refus'd to live a Villain, and has prefer'd Death to a base Action, has been a Gainer by the Bargain. to do with the  28 Philosophy , or Philosophers of our Days. A good Poet, and an honest Historian, may afford Learning enough for a Gentleman . And such a one, whilst he reads these Authors as his Diversion, will have a truer relish of their Sense, and understand 'em better, than a Pedant , with all his Labours, and the assistance of his Volumes of Commentators. I am sensible, that of old 'twas the Custom to send the Youth of highest Quality to Philosophers to be form'd. 'Twas in their Schools, in their Company, and by their Precepts and Example, that the illustrious Pupils were inur'd to Hardship, and exercis'd in the severest Courses of Temperance and Self-denial. By such an early Discipline, they were fitted for the Command of others; to maintain their Country's Honour in War, rule wisely in the State, and fight against Luxury and Corruption in times of Prosperity and Peace. If any of these Arts are comprehended in University-Learning , 'tis well. But as some Universitys in the World are now model'd, they seem not so very effectual to these Purposes, nor so fortunate in preparing for a right Practice of the World, or a just Knowledg of Men and Things. Had you been thorow-pac'd in the Ethicks or Politicks of the Schools, I shou'd never have thought of writing a word to you upon Common Sense , or the Love of Mankind . I shou'd not have cited the Poet's Dulce &Decorum . Nor, if I had made a Character for you, as he for his noble Friend, shou'd I have crown'd it with his Non ille pro caris Amicis, Aut Patria timidus perire. Hor. Lib. 4\. Od. 9\. who said,  29 Skin for Skin: All that a Man has, will he give for his Life . 'Tis Orthodox Divinity, as well as found Philosophy, with some Men, to rate Life by the Number and Exquisiteness of the pleasing Sensations . These they constantly set in opposition to dry Virtue and Honesty . And upon this foot, they think it proper to call all Men Fools, who wou'd hazard a Life , or part with any of these pleasing Sensations ; except on the condition of being repaid in the same Coin, and with good Interest into the bargain. Thus, it seems, we are to learn Virtue by Usury; and inhance the Value of Life , and of the Pleasures of Sense , in order to be wise, and to live well. brought to think mournfully of Death, or to repine at the Loss of what you may sometimes hazard by your Honesty, you can laugh at such Maxims as these; and divert your-self with the improv'd Selfishness, and Philosophical Cowardice of these fashionable Moralists. You will not be taught to value Life at their rate, or degrade Honesty as they do, who make it only a Name . You are persuaded there is something more in the Thing than Fashion or Applause ; that Worth and Merit are substantial, and no way variable by Fancy or Will ; and that Honour is as much it-self, when acting by it-self , and unseen , as when seen , and applauded by all the World. avoid being nasty , when nobody was present." In the first place I shou'd be fully satisfy'd that he himself was a very nasty Gentleman who cou'd ask this Question; and that it wou'd be a hard matter for me to make him ever conceive what true Cleanliness was. However, I might, notwithstanding this, be contented to give him a slight Answer, and say, "'Twas because I had a Nose." Shou'd he trouble me further, and ask again, "What if I had a Cold? Or what if naturally I had no such nice Smell?" I might answer perhaps, "That I car'd as little to see my-self nasty , as that others shou'd see me in that condition." But what if it were in the Dark ? Why even then, tho I had neither Nose, nor Eyes, my Sense of the Matter wou'd be still the same; my Nature wou'd rise at the Thought of what was sordid: or if it did not; I shou'd have a wretched Nature indeed, and hate my-self for a Beast. Honour my-self I never cou'd; whilst I had no better a sense of what, in reality, I ow'd my-self, and what became me, as a human Creature. in the Dark ? What a Man must be to ask this Question, I won't say. But for Those who have no better a Reason for being honest than the Fear of a Gibbet or a Jail ; I shou'd not, I confess, much covet their Company, or Acquaintance. And if any Guardian of mine who had kept his Trust, and given me back my Estate when I came of Age, had been discover'd to have acted thus, thro Fear only of what might happen to him; I shou'd for my own part, no doubt, continue civil and respectful to him: but for my Opinion of his Worth, it wou'd be such as the Pythian God had of his Votary, who devoutly fear'd him, and therefore restor'd to a Friend what had been deposited in his Hands. Reddidit ergo metu, non moribus;  & tamen omnem Vocem adyti dignam templo, veramque probavit, Extinctus tot a pariter cum prole domoque. Juv. Sat . 13. I Know very well that many Services to the Publick are done merely for the sake of a Gratuity ; and that Informers in particular, are to be taken care of, and sometimes made Pensioners of State . But I must beg pardon for the particular Thoughts I may have of these Gentlemens Merit; and shall never bestow my Esteem on any other than the voluntary Discoverers of Villany, and hearty Prosecutors of their Country's Interest. And in this respect, I know nothing greater or nobler than the undertaking and managing some important Accusation; by which some high Criminal of State, or some form'd Body of Conspirators against the Publick, may be arraign'd and brought to Punishment, thro the honest Zeal and publick Affection of a private Man. I Know too, that the mere Vulgar of Mankind often stand in need of such a rectifying Object as the Gallows before their Eyes. Yet I have no belief, that any Man of a liberal Education, or common Honesty, ever needed to have recourse to this Idea in his Mind, the better to restrain him from playing the Knave. And if a Saint had no other Virtue than what was rais'd in him by the same Objects of Reward and Punishment, in a more distant State; I know not whose Love or Esteem he might gain besides: but for my own part, I shou'd never think him worthy of mine. Nec furtum feci, nec fugi, si mihi dicat Servus: Habes pretium, loris non ureris, aio. Non hominem occidi: Non pasces in cruce corvos. Sum Bonus &Frugi: Renuit, negat atque Sabellus. Hor. Epist . 16. I am in earnest in defending Raillery , so I can be sober too in the Use of it. 'Tis in reality a serious Study, to learn to temper and regulate that Humour which Nature has given us, as a more lenitive Remedy against Vice, and a kind of Specifick against Superstition and Melancholy Delusion. There is a great difference between seeking how to raise a Laugh from every thing; and seeking, in every thing, what justly may be laugh'd at. For nothing is ridiculous but what is deform'd: Nor is any thing proof against Raillery , but what is handsom and just. And therefore 'tis the hardest thing in the World, to deny Fair Honesty the use of this Weapon, which can never bear an Edge against herself, and bears against every thing that is contrary. shou'd learn by them, that in their lowest and most scurrilous way of Wit, there was nothing so successfully to be play'd upon, as the Passions of Cowardice and Avarice. One may defy the World to turn real Bravery or Generosity into Ridicule. A Glutton or mere Sensualist, is as ridiculous as the other two Characters. Nor can an unaffected Temperance be made the Subject of Contempt to any besides the grossest and most contemptible of Mankind. Now these three Ingredients make up a virtuous Character: as the contrary three a vicious one. How therefore can we possibly make a Jest of Honesty?---To laugh both ways, is nonsensical. And if the Ridicule lie against Sottishness, Avarice , and Cowardice ; you see the Consequence. A Man must be soundly ridiculous, who, with all the Wit imaginable, wou'd go about to ridicule Wisdom, or laugh at Honesty, or Good Manners. A Man of thorow Good-Breeding , whatever else he be, is incapable of doing a rude or brutal Action. He never deliberates in this case, or considers of the matter by prudential Rules of Self-Interest and Advantage. He acts from his Nature, in a manner necessarily, and without Reflection: and if he did not, it were impossible for him to answer his Character, or be found that truly wellbred Man, on every occasion. 'Tis the same with the Honest Man . He can't deliberate in the Case of a plain Villany. A Plum is no Temptation to him. He likes and loves himself too well, to change Hearts with one of those corrupt Miscreants, who amongst 'em gave that name to a round Sum of Mony gain'd by Rapine and Plunder of the Commonwealth. He who wou'd enjoy a Freedom of Mind , and be truly Possessor of himself , must be above the Thought of stooping to what is villanous or base. He on the other side, who has a Heart to stoop, must necessarily quit the Thought of Manliness, Resolution, Friendship, Merit , and a Character with himself and others : But to affect these Enjoyments and Advantages, together with the Privileges of a licentious Principle; to pretend to enjoy Society , and a free Mind , in company with a knavisb Heart , is as ridiculous as the way of Children, who eat their Cake, and afterwards cry for it. When Men begin to deliberate about Dishonesty, and finding it go less against their Stomach, ask slily, "Why they shou'd stick at a good Piece of Knavery, for a good Sum?" They shou'd be told, as Children, that They can't eat their Cake, and have it. for their Cake . They know Themselves , and are known by Mankind. 'Tis not These who are so much envy'd or admir'd. The moderate Kind are the more taking with us. Yet had we Sense, we shou'd consider 'tis in reality the thorow profligate Knave , the very compleat unnatural Villain alone, who can any way bid for Happiness with the Honest Man . True Interest is wholly on one side, or the other . All between is  30 Inconsistency, Irresolution, Remorse, Vexation, and an Ague-Fit: from hot to cold; from one Passion to another quite contrary; a perpetual Discord of Life; and an alternate Disquiet and Self-dislike. The only Rest or Repose must be thro one , determin'd, considerate Resolution: which when once taken, must be courageously kept; and the Passions and Affections brought under Obedience to it; the Temper steel'd and harden'd to the Mind; the Disposition to the Judgment. Both must agree; else all must be Disturbance and Confusion. So that to think with one's self, in good earnest, "Why may not one do this little Villany, or commit this one Treachery, and but for once ;" is the most ridiculous Imagination in the world, and contrary to Common Sense . For a common honest Man, whilst left to himself, and undisturb'd by Philosophy and subtle Reasonings about his Interest, gives no other Answer to the Thought of Villany, than that he can't possibly find in his heart to set about it, or conquer the natural Aversion he has to it. And this is natural , and just. Honesty is like to gain little by Philosophy, or deep Speculations of any kind. In the main, 'tis best to stick to Common Sense , and go no further. Mens first Thoughts, in this matter, are generally better than their second: their natural Notions better than those refin'd by Study, or Consultation with Casuists . According to common Speech, as well as common Sense, Honesty is the best Policy : But according to refin'd Sense, the only well-advis'd Persons, as to this World, are errant Knaves ; and they alone are thought to serve themselves, who serve their Passions, and indulge their loosest Appetites and Desires.--- Such, it seems, are the Wise , and such the Wisdom of this World! says naturally and heartily, "He wou'd not be guilty of such a thing for the whole World." But speculative Men find great Modifications in the Case; many ways of Evasion; many Remedys; many Alleviations. A good Gift rightly apply'd; a right Method of suing out a Pardon; good Alms-Houses, and Charitable Foundations erected for right Worshippers; and a good Zeal shewn for the right Belief , may sufficiently atone for one wrong Practice ; especially when it is such as raises a Man to a considerable power (as they say) of doing Good , and serving the true Cause. as this. Some Crowns too may have been purchas'd on these terms: and some great  31 Emperors (if I mistake not) there have been of old, who were much assisted by these or the like Principles; and in return were not ingrateful to the Cause and Party which had assisted 'em. The Forgers of such Morals have been amply endow'd: and the World has paid roundly for its Philosophy; since the original plain Principles of Humanity, and the simple honest Precepts of Peace and mutual Love , have, by a sort of spiritual Chymists, been so sublimated, as to become the highest Corrosives; and passing thro their Limbecks, have yielded the strongest Spirit of mutual Hatred and malignant Persecution. the solemn Reprovers of Vice proceed in the manner most sutable to their Genius and Character. I am ready to congratulate with 'em on the Success of their Labours, in that authoritative way which is allow'd 'em. I know not in the mean while, why others may not be allow'd to ridicule Folly, and recommend Wisdom and Virtue (if possibly they can) in a way of Pleasantry and Mirth. I know not why Poets, or such as write chiefly for the Entertainment of themselves and others, may not be allow'd this Privilege. And if it be the Complaint of our standing Reformers , that they are not heard so well by the Gentlemen of Fashion ; if they exclaim against those airy Wits who fly to Ridicule as a Protection, and make successful Sallys from that Quarter; why shou'd it be deny'd one, who is but a Volunteer in this Cause, to engage the Adversary on his own Terms, and expose himself willingly to such Attacks, on the Condition only of being allow'd fair Play in the same kind? Genius, or the Force of good Education, has given a Sense of what is naturally graceful and becoming . Some by mere Nature, others by Art and Practice, are Masters of an Ear in Musick, an Eye in Painting, a Fancy in the ordinary things of Ornament and Grace, a Judgment in Proportions of all kinds, and a general good Taste in most of those Subjects which make the Amusement and Delight of the ingenious People of the World. Let such Gentlemen as these be as extravagant as they please, or as irregular in their Morals; they must at the same time discover their Inconsistency, live at variance with themselves, and in contradiction to that Principle, on which they ground their highest Pleasure and Entertainment. Musicians sing, and Architects or Artists , of whatever kind, describe or form; the most delightful, the most engaging and pathetick, is that which is drawn from real Life and from the Passions . Nothing affects the Heart like that which is purely from it-self , and of its own nature ; such as the Beauty of Sentiments; the Grace of Actions; the Turn of Characters , and the Proportions and Features of a human Mind . This Lesson of Philosophy, even a Romance, a Poem, or a Play may teach us; whilst the fabulous Author leads us with such Pleasure thro the Labyrinth of the Affections, and interests us, whether we will or no, in the Passions of his Heroes and Heroines: \--- Angit, Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet, Vt Magus. Hor. Epist. I. lib. 2. Nature , or withstand this moral Magick . They, for their parts, carry a double Portion of this Charm about with 'em. For in the first place, the very Passion which inspires 'em, is it-self the Love of Numbers, Decency and Proportion ; and this too, not in a narrow sense, or after a selfish way (for Who is there that composes for himself ?) but in a friendly social View; for the Pleasure and Good of others; even down to Posterity, and future Ages. And in the next place, 'tis evident in these Performers, that their chief Theme and Subject, that which raises their Genius the most, and by which they so effectually move others, is purely Manners , and the moral Part . For this is the Effect, and this the Beauty of their Art; "in vocal Measures of Syllables, and Sounds, to express the Harmony and Numbers of an inward kind; and represent the Beautys of a human Soul, by proper Foils, and Contrarietys, which serve as Graces in this Limning, and render this Musick of the Passions more powerful and enchanting." moral Part in their Amours. Yet, what a stir is made about a Heart ! What curious Search of Sentiments , and tender Thoughts ! What Praises of a Humour, a Sense, a je ne s çai quoi of Wit , and all those Graces of a Mind which these Virtuoso-Lovers delight to celebrate! Let them settle this Matter among themselves; and regulate, as they think fit, the Proportions which these different Beautys hold one to another: They must allow still, there is a Beauty of the Mind ; and such as is essential in the Case. Why else is the very Air of Foolishness enough to cloy a Lover, at first sight? Why does an Idiot-Look and Manner destroy the Effect of all those outward Charms, and rob the Fair One of her Power; tho regularly arm'd, in all the Exactness of Feature and Complexion? We may imagine what we please of a substantial solid Part of Beauty: but were the Subject to be well criticiz'd, we shou'd find, perhaps, that what we most admir'd, even in the Turn of outward Features, was but a mysterious Expression, and a kind of shadow of something inward in the Temper: and that when we were struck with a Majestick Air, a sprightly Look , an Amazon bold Grace, or a contrary soft and gentle one; 'twas chiefly the Fancy of these Characters or Qualitys that wrought on us: our Imagination being busy'd in forming beauteous Shapes and Images of this kind, which amus'd the Mind, and held it in admiration; whilst other Passions were employ'd another way. The preliminary Addresses, the Declarations, the Explanations, Confidences, Clearings; the Dependence on something mutual, something felt by way of Return; the Spes animi credula mutui : all these become necessary Ingredients in the Affair of Love, and are authentically establish'd by the Men of Elegance and Art in this way of Passion. withstand the Force of Beauty , in other kinds. Every one is a Virtuoso , of a higher or lower degree: Every one pursues a GRACE, and courts a VENUS of one kind or another. The Venustum , the Honestum , the Decorum of Things, will force its way. They who refuse to give it Scope in the nobler Subjects of a rational and moral kind, will find its Prevalency elsewhere, in an inferiour Order of Things. They who overlook the main Springs of Action, and despise the Thought of Numbers and Proportion in a Life at large , will in the mean Particulars of it, be no less taken up, and engag'd; as either in the Study of common Arts, or in the Care and Culture of mere mechanick Beautys. The Models of Houses, Buildings, and their accompanying Ornaments; the Plans of Gardens and their Compartments; the ordering of Walks, Plantations, Avenues; and a thousand other Symmetrys, will succeed in the room of that happier and higher Symmetry and Order of a Mind. The Species of Fair, Noble, Handsom , will discover it-self on a thousand Occasions, and in a thousand Subjects. The Specter still will haunt us, in some Shape or other: and when driven from our cool Thoughts, and frighted from the Closet , will meet us even at Court , and fill our Heads with Dreams of Grandure, Titles, Honours, and a false Magnificence and Beauty; to which we are ready to sacrifice our highest Pleasure and Ease; and for the sake of which, we become the merest Drudges, and most abject Slaves. Philosophical Beauty, are forc'd often to confess her Charms. They can as heartily as others commend Honesty ; and are as much struck with the Beauty of a generous Part . They admire the Thing it-self; tho not the Means. And, if possible, they wou'd so order it, as to make Probity and Luxury agree. But the Rules of Harmony will not permit it. The Dissonancys are too strong. However, the Attempts of this kind, are not unpleasant to observe. For tho some of the Voluptuous are sordid Pleaders for Baseness and Corruption of every sort: yet others, more generous, endeavour to keep Measures with Honesty; and understanding Pleasure better, are for bringing it under some Rule. They condemn this manner: they praise the other . "So far was right : but further, wrong . Such a Case was allowable: but such a one, not to be admitted." They introduce a Justice , and an Order in their Pleasures. They wou'd bring Reason to be of their Party, account in some manner for their Lives, and form themselves to some kind of Consonancy, and Agreement: Or if they find this impracticable on certain Terms, they wou'd chuse to sacrifice their other Pleasures to those which arise from a generous Behaviour, a Regularity of Conduct, and a Consistency of Life and Manners: Et ver ae Numerosque Modosque ediscere vitoe. Hor. Epist. 2. lib. 2. of Merit , in a generous Character , oppos'd to some detestably vile one . Hence it is that among Poets, the Satyrists seldom fail in doing Justice to Virtue. Nor are any of the nobler Poets false to this Cause. Even modern Wits, whose Turn is all towards Gallantry and Pleasure, when bare-fac'd Villany stands in their way, and brings the contrary Species in view, can sing in passionate Strains the Praises of plain Honesty. prosperous in the possession of other Beautys; we may perchance, as is usual, despise this sober Mistress. But when we see, in the issue, what Riot and Excess naturally produce in the World; when we find that by Luxury's means, and for the service of vile Interests, Knaves are advanc'd above us, and the vilest of Men prefer'd before the honestest; we then behold Virtue in a new Light, and by the assistance of such a Foil, can discern the Beauty of Honesty , and the reality of those Charms, which before we understood not to be either natural, or powerful. and Moral Truth . For all Beauty is Truth . True Features make the Beauty of a Face; and true Proportions the Beauty of Architecture; as true Measures that of Harmony and Musick. In Poetry, which is all Fable, Truth still is the Perfection. And whoever is Scholar enough to read the antient Philosopher, or his  32 modern Copists, upon the nature of a Dramatick and Epick Poem, will easily understand this account of Truth. A Painter , if he have any Genius, understands the Truth and Unity of Design; and knows he is even then unnatural, when he follows Nature too close, and strictly copies Life . For his Art allows him not to bring All Nature into his Piece, but a Part only. However, his Piece, if it be beautiful, and carries Truth , must be a Whole , by it-self, compleat, independent, and withal as great and comprehensive as he can make it. So that Particulars, on this occasion, must yield to the general Design; and all Things be subservient to that which is principal: in order to form a certain Easiness of Sight ; a simple, clear, and  33 united View , which wou'd be broken and disturb'd by the Expression of any thing peculiar, or distinct. Now the Variety of Nature is such as to distinguish every thing she forms, by a peculiar original Character; which, if strictly observ'd, will make the Subject appear unlike to any thing extant in the World besides. But this Effect the good Poet and Painter seek industriously to prevent. They hate Minuteness , and are afraid of Singularity ; which wou'd make their Images, or Characters, appear capricious and fantastical. The mere Face- Painter, indeed, has little in common with the Poet; but, like the mere Historian, copies what he sees, and minutely traces every Feature, and odd Mark. 'Tis otherwise with the Men of Invention and Design. 'Tis from the many Objects of Nature, and not from a particular one , that those Genius's form the Idea of their Work. Thus the best Artists are said to have been indefatigable in studying the best Statues: as knowing them a better Rule, than the perfectest Human Bodys cou'd afford. And thus some considerable Wits have recommended the best Poems, as preferable to the best of Historys; and better teaching the Truth of Characters, and Nature of Mankind. themselves to these Rules, Few are insensible of 'em. Whatever Quarter we may give to our vicious Poets, or other Composers of irregular and short-liv'd Works; we know very well that the standing Pieces of good Artists must be form'd after a more uniform way. Every just Work of theirs comes under those natural Rules of Proportion, and Truth . The Creature of their Brain must be like one of Nature's Formation. It must have a Body and Parts proportionable: or the very Vulgar will not fail to criticize the Work, when it has neither Head nor Tail . For so Common Sense (according to just Philosophy) judges of those Works which want the Justness of a Whole , and shew their Author, however curious and exact in Particulars, to be in the main a very Bungler: Inf aelix operis Summa , quia ponere Nescit. Hor. Epist. 3. Lib. 2. Plastick Truth . Narrative, or Historical Truth , must needs be highly estimable; especially when we consider how Mankind, who are become so deeply interested in the Subject, have suffer'd by the want of Clearness in it. 'Tis it-self a part of Moral Truth . To be a Judg in one , requires a Judgment in the other . The Morals, the Character, and Genius of an Author, must be thorowly consider'd: And the Historian or Relater of Things important to Mankind, must, whoever he be, approve himself many ways to us; both in respect of his Judgment, Candour, and Disinterestedness; e'er we are bound to take any thing on his Authority. And as for  34 critical Truth ; or the Judgment and Determination of what Commentators, Translators, Paraphrasts, Grammarians, and others have, on this occasion, deliver'd to us; in the midst of such Variety of Stile, such different Readings, such Interpolations, and Corruptions in the Originals; such Mistakes of Copists, Transcribers, Editors, and a hundred such Accidents, to which antient Books are subject: it becomes, upon the whole, a Matter of nice Speculation ; considering, withal, that the Reader, tho an able Linguist, must be supported by so many other Helps from Chronology, Natural Philosophy, Geography, and other Sciences. order to judg rightly of Historical Truth , and of the past Actions and Circumstances of Mankind, as deliver'd down to us by antient Authors of different Nations, different Times, and different in their Characters and Interests. Some Moral and Philosophical Truths there are withal so evident in themselves, that 'twou'd be easier to imagine half Mankind to have run mad, and join'd precisely in one and the same Species of Folly, than to admit any thing as Truth , which shou'd be advanc'd against such natural Knowledg, fundamental Reason , and common Sense. to have no better knowledg of Truth , nor better manner of judging it, than by counting Noses . By this Rule, if they can poll an indifferent Number out of a Mob ; if they can but produce a Set of Lancashire Noddles, remote provincial Head-Pieces, or visionary Assemblers, to attest a Story of a Witch upon a Broomstick , and a Flight in the Air ; they triumph in the solid Proof of their new Prodigy, and cry, Magna est Veritas &praevalebit! such a discerning Age, wou'd set her on the foot of popular Tradition; and venture her on the same bottom with Parish-Tales, and Gossiping Storys of Imps, Goblins , and Demoniacal Pranks , invented to fright Children, or make Practice for common Exorcists, and Cunning-Men ! For by that Name, you know, Country People are us'd to call those Dealers in Mystery, who are thought to conjure in an honest way , and foil the Devil at his own Weapon. Reflections; lest by endeavouring to expound things any further, I shou'd be drawn from my way of Humour , to harangue profoundly on these Subjects. But shou'd you find I had moraliz'd in any tolerable manner, according to Common Sense , and without Canting ; I cou'd be satisfy'd with my Performance, such as it is, without fearing what Disturbance I might possibly give to some formal Censors of the Age; whose Discourses and Writings are of another strain. I have taken the Liberty, you see, to laugh , upon some Occasions: And if I have either laugh'd wrong, or been impertinently serious; I can be content to be laugh'd at , in my Turn. If contrariwise I am rail'd at, I can laugh still, as before; and with fresh Advantage to my Cause. For tho, in reality, there cou'd be nothing less a laughing Matter, than the provok'd Rage, Ill- Will, and Fury of certain zealous Gentlemen, were they arm'd as lately they have been known; yet as the Magistrate has since taken care to pare their Talons, there is nothing very terrible in their Encounter. On the contrary, there is something comical in the Case. It brings to one's mind the Fancy of those Grotesque Figures, and Dragon-Faces, which are seen often in the Frontispiece, and on the Corner-Stones of old Buildings. They seem plac'd there, as the Defenders and Supporters of the Edifice; but with all their Grimace, are as harmless to People without, as they are useless to the Building within. Great Efforts of Anger to little purpose, serve for Pleasantry and Farce. Exceeding Fierceness , with perfect Inability and Impotence , makes the highest Ridicule. I am, Dear Friend, Affectionately Yours, & c. \--- Nec T E qu aesiveris extra. Perf. Sat. I. occasions, I have heard from People of good understanding; "That, as to what related to private Conduct, No one was ever the better for Advice. " But upon further Examination, I have resolv'd with my-self, that the Maxim might be admitted without any violent prejudice to Mankind. For in the manner that Advice was generally given, there was no reason, I thought, to wonder it shou'd be so ill receiv'd. Something there was which strangely inverted the Case, and made the Giver to be the only Gainer. For by what I cou'd observe in many Occurrences of our Lives, That which we call'd giving Advice , was properly, taking an occasion to shew our own Wisdom, at another's expence. On the other side, to be instructed, or to receive Advice on the terms usually prescrib'd to us, was little better than tamely to afford another the Occasion of raising himself a Character from our Defects. easy matter to make Advice a free Gift. For to make a Gift free indeed, there must be nothing in it which takes from Another, to add to Our- self. In all other respects, to give , and to dispense , is Generosity, and Good-will: but to bestow Wisdom, is to gain a Mastery which can't so easily be allow'd us. Men willingly learn whatever else is taught 'em. They can bear a Master in Mathematicks, in Musick, or in any other Science; but not in Understanding and Good Sense. in this respect. For all Authors at large are, in a manner, profess'd Masters of Understanding to the Age. And for this reason, in early days, Poets were look'd upon as authentick Sages , for dictating Rules of Life, and teaching Manners and good Sense. How they may have lost their Pretension, I can't say. 'Tis their peculiar Happiness and Advantage, not to be oblig'd to lay their Claim openly. And if whilst they profess only to please , they secretly advise , and give Instruction; they may now perhaps, as well as formerly, be esteem'd, with justice, the best and most honourable among Authors. in other Authors; what must his Case be, who dictates to Authors themselves ? to consider of the Way and Manner of advising. My Science, if it be any, is no better than that of a Language-Master , or a Logician. For I have taken it strongly into my head, that there is a certain Knack or Legerdemain in Argument, by which we may safely proceed to the dangerous part of advising , and make sure of the good fortune to have our Advice accepted, if it be any thing worth. Practice , we all allow, that makes a Hand. "But who, on this occasion, will be practis'd on ? Who will willingly be the first to try our Hand , and afford us the requisite Experience ?" Here lies the Difficulty. For supposing we had Hospitals for this sort of Surgery , and that there were always in readiness certain meek Patients that wou'd bear any Incisions, and be prob'd or tented at our pleasure; the advantage no doubt wou'd be considerable in this way of Practice. Some Insight must needs be obtain'd. In time a Hand too might be acquir'd; but in all likelihood a very rough one : which wou'd by no means serve the purpose of this latter Surgery. For here, a Tenderness of Hand is principally requisite. No Surgeon will be call'd, but who has Feeling and Compassion. And where to find a Subject in which the Operator is likely to preserve the highest Tenderness , and yet act with the greatest Resolution and Boldness , is certainly a matter of no slight Consideration. a certain Air of chimerical Fancy and Conceit, which is apt to render the Projectors somewhat liable to Ridicule. I wou'd therefore prepare my Reader against this Prejudice; by assuring him, that in the Operation propos'd, there is nothing which can justly excite his Laughter; or if there be, the Laugh perhaps may turn against him, by his own Consent, and with his own Concurrence: Which is a Specimen of that very Art or Science we are about to illustrate. and Art of Surgery , "That we can no where find such a meek Patient , with whom we can in reality make bold , and for whom nevertheless we are sure to preserve the greatest Tenderness and Regard :" I assert the contrary; and say, for instance, That we have each of us Ourselves to practise on. "Mere Quibble! (you'l say:) For who can thus multiply himself into two Persons , and be his own Subject ? Who can properly laugh at himself , or find in his heart to be either merry or severe on such an occasion?" Go to the Poets , and they will present you with many Instances. Nothing is more common with them, than this sort of Soliloquy. A Person of profound Parts, or perhaps of ordinary Capacity, happens, on some occasion, to commit a Fault. He is concern'd for it. He comes alone upon the Stage; looks about him, to see if any body be near; then takes himself to task, without sparing himself in the least. You wou'd wonder to hear how home he pushes matters, and how thorowly he carries on the Business of Self-Dissection. By virtue of this Soliloquy he becomes two distinct Persons. He is Pupil and Preceptor. He teaches, and he learns. And in good earnest, had I nothing else to plead in behalf of the Morals of our modern Dramatick Poets, I shou'd defend 'em still against their Accusers for the sake of this very Practice, which they have taken care to keep up in its full force. For whether or no the Practice be natural , in respect of common Custom and Usage; I take upon me to assert, that it is an honest and laudable Practice; and that if already it be not natural to us, we ought however to make it so, by Study and Application. " Are we to go therefore to the Stage for Edification? Must we learn our Catechism from the Poets? And, like the Players, speak aloud , what we debate at any time with our-selves alone?" Not absolutely so perhaps. Tho where the harm wou'd be, of spending some Discourse, and bestowing a little Breath and clear Voice purely upon our-selves , I can't see. We might peradventure be less noisy and more profitable in Company, if at convenient times we discharg'd some of our articulate Sound, and spoke to ourselves viv a voce when alone. For Company is an extreme Provocative to Fancy; and, like a hot Bed in gardening, is apt to make our Imaginations sprout too fast. But by this anticipating Remedy of Soliloquy , we may effectually provide against the Inconvenience. extremely apprehensive of the Effects of this Frothiness or Ventosity in Speech, and were accordingly resolv'd to provide thorowly against the Evil. They carry'd this Remedy of ours so far, that it was not only their Custom, but their Religion and Law, to speak, laugh, use Action, gesticulate, and do all in the same manner when alone, as when they were in Company. If you had stol'n upon 'em unawares at any time, when they had been by themselves, you might have found 'em in high Dispute, arguing with themselves, reproving, counselling, haranguing themselves, and in the most florid manner accosting their own Persons. In all likelihood they had been once a People remarkably fluent in Expression, much pester'd with Orators and Preachers, and mightily subject to that Disease which has been since call'd the Leprosy of Eloquence ; till some sage Legislator arose amongst 'em, who when he cou'd not oppose the Torrent of Words, and stop the Flux of Speech, by any immediate Application, found means to give a vent to the loquacious Humour, and broke the force of the Distemper by eluding it. Method of Soliloquy , as to suffer it to become a national Practice. 'Tis but a small Portion of this Regimen , which I wou'd willingly borrow, and apply to private use; especially in the case of Authors. I am sensible how fatal it might prove to many honourable Persons, shou'd they acquire such a Habit as this, or offer to practice such an Art, within reach of any mortal Ear. For 'tis well known, we are not many of us like that Roman , who wish'd for Windows to his Breast, that all might be as conspicuous there as in his House, which for that very reason he had built as open as was possible. I wou'd therefore advise our Probationer , upon his first Exercise, to retire into some thick Wood, or rather take the Point of some high Hill; where, besides the Advantage of looking about him for Security, he wou'd find the Air perhaps more rarefy'd, and sutable to that Perspiration which is requir'd, especially in the Case of a Poetical Genius. Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus, & fugit Urbes. Hor. Epist. 2. Lib. 2. ours, and generally describ'd themselves as a People liable to sufficient Ridicule, for their great Loquacity by themselves, and their profound Taciturnity in Company. Not only the Poet and Philosopher , but the Orator himself was wont to have recourse to our Method. And the Prince of this latter Tribe may be prov'd to have been a great Frequenter of the Woods and River-Banks; where he consum'd abundance of his Breath, suffer'd his Fancy to evaporate, and reduc'd the vehemence both of his Spirit and Voice. If other Authors find nothing that invites 'em to these Recesses , 'tis because their Genius is not of force enough: Or tho it be, their Character, they may imagine, will hardly bear 'em out. For to be surpriz'd in the odd Actions, Gestures, or Tones, which are proper to such Asceticks , I must own wou'd be but an ill Adventure for a Man of the World. But with Poets and Philosophers 'tis a known Case. Aut insanit Homo, aut versus facit. \--- Hor. Sat. 7. Lib. 2. those latter Composers who deal in Systems, and airy Speculations, they have vulgarly pass'd for a sort of Prose-Poets. Their secret Practice and Habit has been as frequently noted: Murmura c um secum & rabiosa silentia rodunt. Pers. Sat. 3. Both these sorts are happily indulg'd in this Method of Evacuation. They are thought to act naturally, and in their proper way, when they assume these odd Manners. But of other Authors 'tis expected they shou'd be better bred. They are oblig'd to preserve a more conversible Habit; which is no small Misfortune to 'em. For if their Meditation and Resvery be obstructed by the fear of a nonconforming Meen in Conversation, they may happen to be so much the worse Authors for being finer Gentlemen. Their Fervency of Imagination may possibly be as strong as either the Philosopher's or the Poet's. But being deny'd an equal Benefit of Discharge, and withheld from the wholesom manner of Relief in private; 'tis no wonder if they appear with so much Froth and Scum in publick. chiefly subject to this frothy Distemper. Nor can it be doubted that this is the true Reason why these Gentlemen entertain the World so lavishly with what relates to themselves . For having had no opportunity of privately conversing with themselves, or exercising their own Genius , so as to make Acquaintance with it, or prove its Strength; they immediately fall to work in a wrong place, and exhibit on the Stage of the World that Practice , which they shou'd have kept to themselves; if they design'd that either they, or the World, shou'd be the better for their Moralitys. Who indeed can endure to hear an Empirick talk of his own Constitution, how he governs and manages it, what Diet agrees best with it, and what his Practice is with himself? The Proverb, no doubt, is very just, Physician cure thy-self . Yet methinks one shou'd have but an ill time, to be present at these bodily Operations. Nor is the Reader in truth any better entertain'd, when he is oblig'd to assist at the experimental Discussions of his practising Author, who all the while is in reality doing no better, than taking his Physick in publick. Meditations, occasional Reflections, solitary Thoughts , or other such Exercises as come under the notion of this self-discoursing Practice. And the modestest Title I can conceive for such Works, wou'd be that of a certain Author, who call'd them his Cruditys. 'Tis the Unhappiness of those Wits, who conceive suddenly, but without being able to go out their full time, that after many Miscarriages and Abortions, they can bring nothing well-shapen or perfect into the World. They are not however the less fond of their Offspring, which they in a manner beget in Publick. For so publick-spirited they are, that they can never afford themselves the least time to think in private, for their own particular Benefit and Use. For this reason, tho they are often retir'd, they are never by themselves. The World is ever of the Party. They have their Author-Character in view, and are always considering how this or that Thought wou'd serve to compleat some Set of Contemplations , or furnish out the Common-Place-Book, from whence these treasur'd Riches are to flow in Plenty on the necessitous World. kind; 'tis not to be imagin'd how much farther still their Charity is apt to extend. So exceeding great is their Indulgence and Tenderness for Mankind, that they are unwilling the least Sample of their devout Exercise shou'd be lost. Tho there are already so many Formularys and Rituals appointed for this Species of Soliloquy ; they can allow nothing to lie conceal'd which passes in this religious Commerce and way of Dialogue between Them and their Soul. Converse either with themselves, or with Heaven; whilst they look thus asquint upon the World, and carry Titles and Editions along with 'em in their Meditations. And altho the Books of this sort, by a common Idiom, are call'd good Books ; the Authors, for certain, are but a sorry Race: For religious Cruditys are undoubtedly the worst of any.  35 A Saint -Author of all Men least values Politeness. He scorns to confine that Spirit, in which he writes, to Rules of Criticism and profane Learning. Nor is he inclin'd in any respect to play the Critick on himself, or regulate his Stile or Language by the Standard of good Company and People of the better sort. He is above the Consideration of that which in a narrow sense we call Manners. Nor is he apt to examine any other Faults than those which he calls Sins : Tho a Sinner against Good-Breeding, and the Laws of Decency, will no more be look'd on as a good Author , than a Sinner against Grammar, good Argument, or good Sense. And if Moderation and Temper are not of the Party with a Writer; let his Cause be ever so good, I doubt whether he will be able to recommend it with great Advantage to the World. Converse to all such Persons as are addicted to write after the manner of holy Advisers ; especially if they lie under an indispensible Necessity of being Talkers or Haranguers in the same kind. For to discharge frequently and vehemently in publick, is a great hindrance to the way of private Exercise ; which consists chiefly in Controul. But where, instead of Controul, Debate or Argument, the chief Exercise of the Wit consists in uncontroulable Harangues and Reasonings, which must neither be question'd nor contradicted; there is great danger, lest the Party, thro this habit, shou'd suffer much by Cruditys, Indigestions, Choler, Bile, and particularly by a certain Tumor or Flatulency , which renders him of all Men the least able to apply the wholesom Regimen of Self-Practice. 'Tis no wonder if such quaint Practitioners grow to an enormous Size of Absurdity, whilst they continue in the reverse of that Practice, by which alone we correct the Redundancy of Humours, and chasten the Exuberance of Conceit and Fancy. our common great Talkers , who engross the greatest part of the Conversations of the World, and are the forwardest to speak in publick Assemblys. Many of these have a sprightly Genius, attended with a mighty Heat and Ebullition of Fancy. But 'tis a certain Observation in our Science, that they who are great Talkers in Company , have never been any Talkers by themselves , not us'd to these private Discussions of our home Regimen. For which Reason their Froth abounds. Nor can they discharge any thing without some mixture of it. But when they carry their Attempts beyond ordinary Discourse, and wou'd rise to the Capacity of Authors , the Case grows worse with 'em. Their Page can carry none of the Advantages of their Person. They can no way bring into Paper those Airs they give themselves in Discourse. The Turns of Voice and Action, with which they help out many a lame Thought and incoherent Sentence, must here be laid aside; and the Speech taken to pieces, compar'd together, and examin'd from head to foot. So that unless the Party has been us'd to play the Critick thorowly upon himself, he will hardly be found proof against the Criticisms of others. His Thoughts can never appear very correct; unless they have been us'd to found Correction by themselves, and been well form'd and disciplin'd before they are brought into the Field. 'Tis the hardest thing in the world to be a good Thinker , without being a strong Self-Examiner , and thorow-pac'd Dialogist , in this solitary way. very justifiably take occasion here to enter into a spacious Field of Learning, to shew the Antiquity of that Opinion, "That we have each of us a D aemon, Genius, Angel , or Guardian-Spirit , to whom we were strictly join'd, and committed, from our earliest Dawn of Reason, or Moment of our Birth." This Opinion, were it literally true, might be highly serviceable, no doubt, towards the Establishment of our System and Doctrine. For it wou'd infallibly be prov'd a kind of Sacrilege or Impiety to slight the Company of so Divine a Guest , and in a manner banish him our Breast, by refusing to enter with him into those secret Conferences, by which alone he cou'd be enabled to become our Adviser and Guide. But I shou'd esteem it unfair to proceed upon such an Hypothesis as this: when all that the wise Antients ever meant by this D aemon -Companion, I conceive to have been no more than enigmatically to declare, that we had each of us a Patient in our-self ; that we were properly our own Subjects of Practice; and that we then became due Practitioners, when by virtue of an intimate Recess we cou'd discover a certain Duplicity of Soul, and divide our-selves into two Partys. One of these, as they suppos'd, wou'd immediately approve himself a venerable Sage ; and with an air of Authority erect himself our Counsellor and Governor; whilst the other Party, who had nothing in him but what was servile , wou'd be contented to follow and obey. Number practically form'd in Us, we were suppos'd to advance in Morals and true Wisdom. This, they thought, was the only way of composing Matters in our Breast, and establishing that Subordinacy, which alone cou'd make Us agree with our-selves, and be of a piece within. They esteem'd this a more religious Work, than any Prayers, or other Duty in the Temple. And this they advis'd Us to carry thither, as the best Offering that cou'd be made: Compositum Jus, fasque animi, sanctosque Recessus Mentis. \---Pers. Sat. 2. your-self , or Be Two. For if the Division were rightly made, all within wou'd of course, they thought, be rightly understood, and prudently manag'd. Such Confidence they had in this Home Dialect of Soliloquy. For it was look'd upon to be the peculiar of Philosophers and wise Men, to be able to hold themselves in Talk. And it was their Boast on this account, "That they were never less alone , than when by themselves. " A Knave, they thought, cou'd never be by himself. Not that his Conscience was always sure of giving him Disturbance; but he had not, they suppos'd, so much Interest with himself, as to exert this generous Faculty, and raise himself a Companion ; who being fairly admitted into Partnership, wou'd quickly mend his Partner, and settle his Affairs on a right foot. Minds, and understand what our main Scope was; what we plainly drove at, and what we propos'd to our-selves, as our End , in every Occurrence of our Lives. But our Thoughts have generally such an obscure implicit Language, that 'tis the hardest thing in the world to make 'em speak out distinctly. For this reason, the right Method is to give 'em Voice and Accent. And this, in our default, is what the Moralists or Philosophers endeavour to do, to our hand; when, as is usual, they hold us out a kind of vocal Looking-Glass, draw Sound out of our Breast, and instruct us to personate our-selves, in the plainest manner. Illa sibi introrsum, & sub Lingua immurmurat: o si Ebullit Patrui pr aeclarum funus !--- Pers. Sat. 2. fashionable World, gives a Son the assurance to tell a Father, he has liv'd too long: And a Husband the privilege of talking of his Second Wife before his First. But let the airy Gentleman, whoever he be, that makes thus bold with others, retire a while out of Company; and he scarce dares tell himself his Wishes. Much less can he endure to carry on his Thought, as he necessarily must, if he enters once thorowly into Himself , and proceeds by Interrogatorys to form the Home-Acquaintance and Familiarity requir'd. For thus, after some struggle, we may suppose him to accost himself. "Tell me now, my honest Heart! Am I really honest , and of some worth? or do I only make a fair shew, and am intrinsecally no better than a Rascal ? As good a Friend, a Country-man, or a Relation, as I appear outwardly to the World, or as I wou'd willingly perhaps think my-self to be; shou'd I not in reality be glad they were hang'd, or broke their Necks, whoever they were, that stood between Me and the least portion of an Estate? Why not? since 'tis my Interest. Shou'd I not be glad therefore to help this matter forwards, and promote my interest , if it lay fairly in my Power? No doubt; provided I were sure not to be punish'd for it. And what reason has the greatest Rogue in nature for not doing thus? The same reason, and no other. Am I not then, at the bottom, the same as he is? The same: an arrant Villain; tho perhaps more a Coward, and not so perfect in my kind. If Interest therefore points me out this Road; whither wou'd Humanity and Compassion lead me? Quite contrary. Why therefore do I cherish such Weaknesses? Why do I sympathize with others? Why please myself in the Conceit of Worth and Honour? a Character, a Memory, an Issue , or a Name ? What else are these but Scruples in my way? Wherefore do I thus bely my own Interest , and by keeping my-self half-Knave , approve my-self a thorow Fool ?" whatever Raillery we may use with others. We may defend Villany, or cry up Folly, before the World: But to appear Fools, Mad-men, or Varlets, to our- selves ; and prove it to our own Faces, that we are really such , is insupportable. For so true a Reverence has every one for himself, when he comes clearly to appear before his close Companion, that he had rather profess the vilest things of himself in open Company, than hear his Character privately from his own Mouth. So that we may readily from hence conclude, That the chief Interest of Ambition, Avarice, Corruption , and every sly insinuating Vice , is to prevent this Interview and Familiarity of Discourse which is consequent upon close Retirement and inward Recess. 'Tis the grand Artifice of Villany and Leudness , as well as of Superstition and Bigotry , to put us upon Terms of greater Distance and Formality with our-selves, and evade our proving Method of Soliloquy. And for this reason, how specious soever may be the Instruction and Doctrine of Formalists ; their very Manner it-self is a sufficient Blind , or Remora , in the way of Honesty and good Sense. more profound and solemn way of Love, he wou'd be apt to conclude, that he was no Stranger to our propos'd Method of Practice; being conscious to himself of having often made vigorous Excursions into those solitary Regions above- mention'd; where Soliloquy is upheld with most Advantage. He may chance to remember how he has many times address'd the Woods and Rocks in audible articulate Sounds, and seemingly expostulated with himself in such a manner as if he had really form'd the requisite Distinction , and had the Power to entertain himself in due form. But it is very apparent, that notwithstanding all were true which we have here suppos'd, it can no way reach the Case before us. For a passionate Lover, whatever Solitude he may affect, can never be truly by himself. His Case is like the Author's who has begun his Courtship to the Publick, and is embark'd in an Intrigue which sufficiently amuses, and takes him out of himself. Whatever he meditates alone, is interrupted still by the imagin'd Presence of the Mistress he pursues. Not a Thought, not an Expression, not a Sigh, that is purely for Himself. All is appropriated, and all devoutly tender'd to the Object of his Passion. Insomuch that there is nothing ever so trivial or accidental of this kind, that he is not desirous shou'd be witness'd by the Party, whose Grace and Favour he sollicits. being capable of this Entertainment. Instead of looking narrowly into his own Nature and Mind, that he may be no longer a Mystery to himself, he is taken up with the Contemplation of other mysterious Natures, which he can never explain or comprehend. He has the Specters of his Zeal before his Eyes; and is as familiar with his Modes, Essences, Personages, and Exhibitions of Deity , as the Conjurer with his different Forms, Species, and Orders of Genii or D aemons. So that we make no doubt to assert, that not so much as a recluse Religionist, a Votary, or Hermit , was ever truly by himself. And thus since neither Lover, Author, Mystick , or Conjurer (who are the only Claimants) can truly or justly be intitl'd to a Share in this Self- entertainment; it remains that the only Person intitl'd, is the Man of Sense , the Sage , or Philosopher. However, since of all other Characters we are generally the most inclin'd to favour that of a Lover , it may not, we hope, be impertinent, on this occasion, to recite the Story of an Amour. made War upon a Tyrant, who was in every respect his Reverse. 'Twas the Happiness of our Prince to be as great a Conqueror by his Clemency and Bounty, as by his Arms and military Virtue. Already he had won over to his Party several Potentates and Princes, who before had been subject to the Tyrant. Among those that adher'd still to the Enemy, there was a Prince, who having all the advantage of Person and Merit, had lately been made happy in the Possession and mutual Love of the most beautiful Princess in the world. It happen'd that the Occasions of the War call'd the new-marry'd Prince to a distance from his belov'd Princess. He left her secure, as he thought, in a strong Castle, far within the Country, but in his absence the place was taken by surprize, and the Princess brought a Captive to the Quarters of our Heroick Prince. had been educated with him, and was still treated by him with perfect Familiarity. Him he immediately sent for, and with strict Injunctions committed the captive Princess to his charge; resolving she shou'd be treated with that Respect which was due to her high Rank and Merit. 'Twas the same young Lord, who had discover'd her disguis'd among the Prisoners, and learnt her Story; the particulars of which he now related to the Prince. He spoke in extasy on this occasion; telling the Prince how beautiful she appear'd, even in the midst of Sorrow; and tho disguis'd under the meanest Habit, yet how distinguishable, by her Air and Manner, from every other Beauty of her Sex. But what appear'd strange to our young Nobleman, was, that the Prince, during this whole relation, discover'd not the least Intention of seeing the Lady, or satisfying that Curiosity, which seem'd so natural on such an occasion. He press'd him; but without success. "Not see her, Sir! (said he, wondring) when she is so handsom, beyond what you have ever seen!" " For that very reason, reply'd the Prince, I wou'd the rather decline the Interview. For shou'd I, upon the bare Report of her Beauty, be so charm'd as to make the first Visit at this urgent time of Business; I may upon sight, with better reason, be induc'd perhaps to visit her, when I am more at leisure: and so again and again; till at last I may have no leisure left for my Affairs." "Wou'd you, Sir! persuade me then, said the young Nobleman (smiling) that a fair Face can have such Power as to force the Will it-self, and constrain a Man in any respect to act contrary to what he thinks becoming him? Are we to hearken to the Poets in what they tell us of that Incendiary Love , and his irresistible Flames? A real Flame, we see, burns all alike. But that imaginary one of Beauty hurts only those who are consenting. It affects no otherwise, than as we ourselves are pleas'd to allow it. In many Cases we absolutely command it: as where Relation and Consanguinity are in the nearest degree. Authority and Law, we see, can master it. But 'twou'd be vain as well as unjust, for any Law to intermeddle or prescribe, were not the Case voluntary, and our Will intirely free. " " How comes it then, reply'd the Prince, that if we are thus Masters of our Choice, and free at first to admire and love where we approve, we cannot afterwards as well cease to love whenever we see cause? This latter Liberty you will hardly defend. For I doubt not, but you have heard of many, who tho they were us'd to set the highest value upon Liberty before they lov'd, yet afterwards were necessitated to serve in the most abject manner: finding themselves constrain'd and bound by a stronger Chain than any of Iron, or Adamant." " Such Wretches, reply'd the Youth, I have often heard complain; who, if you will believe 'em, are wretched indeed, without Means or Power to help themselves. You may hear 'em in the same manner complain grievously of Life it-self. But tho there are Doors enow to go out of Life, they find it convenient to keep still where they are. They are the very same Pretenders, who thro this Plea of irresistible Necessity make bold with what is another's, and attempt unlawful Beds. But the Law, I perceive, makes bold with them in its turn, as with other Invaders of Property. Neither is it your Custom, Sir, to pardon such Offences. So that Beauty it-self, you must allow, is innocent and harmless, and can compel no one to do any thing amiss. The Debauch'd compel themselves, and unjustly charge their Guilt on Love. They who are honest and just, can admire and love whatever is beautiful; without offering at any thing beyond what is allow'd. How then is it possible, Sir, that one of your Virtue shou'd be in pain on any such account, or fear such a Temptation? You see, Sir, I am found and whole, after having beheld the Princess. I have convers'd with her; I have admir'd her in the highest degree: Yet am my-self still, and in my Duty; and shall be ever in the same manner at your command." and look to your Charge carefully, as it becomes you. For it may so happen in the present posture of the War, that this Fair Captive may stand us in good stead." immediately took such care of the captive Princess and her Houshold, that she seem'd as perfectly obey'd, and had every thing that belong'd to her in as great Splendour now, as in her Principality, and in the height of Fortune. He found her in every respect deserving, and saw in her a Generosity of Soul which was beyond her other Charms. His Study to oblige her, and soften her Distress, made her in return desirous to express a Gratitude; which he easily perceiv'd. She shew'd on every occasion a real Concern for his Interest; and when he happen'd to fall ill, she took such tender care of him herself, and by her Servants, that he seem'd to owe his Recovery to her Friendship. be conceiv'd) the Youth fell desperately in Love. At first he offer'd not to make the least mention of his Passion to the Princess. For he scarce dar'd tell it to himself. But afterwards he grew Bolder. She receiv'd his Declaration with an unaffected Trouble and Concern, spoke to him as a Friend, to dissuade him as much as possible from such an extravagant Attempt. But when he talk'd to her of Force , she immediately sent away one of her faithful Domesticks to the Prince, to implore his Protection. The Prince receiv'd the Message with the appearance of more than ordinary Concern: sent instantly for one of his first Ministers; and bid him go with that Domestick to the young Nobleman, and let him understand, "That Force was not to be offer'd to such a Lady; Persuasion he might use, if he thought fit." aggravate the Message, inveigh'd publickly against him on this occasion, and to his Face reproach'd him as a Traitor and Dishonourer of his Prince and Nation: with all that cou'd be said against him, as guilty of the highest Sacrilege, Perfidiousness, and Breach of Trust. So that in reality, the Youth look'd upon his Case as desperate, fell into the deepest Melancholy, and prepar'd himself for that Fate, which he thought he well deserv'd. him in the utmost Confusion, "I find, said he , my Friend, I am now become dreadful to you indeed; since you can neither see me without Shame, nor imagine me to be without Resentment. But away with all those Thoughts from this time forwards. I know how much you have suffer'd on this occasion. I know the Power of Love , and am no otherwise safe my-self, than by keeping out of the way of Beauty. 'Twas I who was in fault; 'twas I who unhappily match'd you with that unequal Adversary, and gave you that impracticable Task and hard Adventure, which no-one yet was ever strong enough to accomplish." " In this, Sir, reply'd the Youth, as in all else, you express that Goodness which is so natural to you. You have Compassion, and can allow for human Frailty; but the rest of Mankind will never cease to upbraid me. Nor shall I ever be forgiven, were I able ever to forgive my-self. I am reproach'd by my nearest Friends. I must be odious to all Mankind, wherever I am known. The least Punishment I can think due to me, is Banishment for ever from your Presence." " Think not of such a thing for ever , said the Prince, but trust me; if you retire only for a while , I shall so order it, that you shall soon return again with the Applause, even of those who are now your Enemys, when they find what a considerable Service you shall have render'd both to them and Me." Youth. He was transported to think, that his Misfortunes cou'd be turn'd any way to the Advantage of his Prince: he enter'd with Joy into the Scheme the Prince had laid for him, and appear'd eager to depart, and execute what was appointed him. "Can you then, said the Prince, resolve to quit the charming Princess?" "O Sir ! reply'd the Youth, well am I now satisfy'd that I have in reality within me two distinct separate Souls. This Lesson of Philosophy I have learnt from that villanous Sophister LOVE. For 'tis impossible to believe, that having one and the same Soul, it shou'd be actually both Good and Bad, passionate for Virtue and Vice, desirous of Contrarys. No. There must of necessity be Two : and when the Good prevails, 'tis then we act handsomly; when the Ill , then basely and villanously. Such was my Case. For lately the Ill Soul was wholly Master. But now the Good prevails, by your assistance; and I am plainly a new Creature, with quite another Apprehension , another Reason , another Will ." the chief Principle of Philosophy, and understand our Doctrine of Two Persons in one individual Self. Not that our Courtier, we suppose, was able, of himself, to form this Distinction justly and according to Art. For cou'd he have effected this, he wou'd have been able to cure himself, without the assistance of his Prince. However he was wise enough to see in the issue, that his Independency and Freedom were mere Glosses, and Resolution a Nose of Wax. For let Will be ever so free, Humour and Fancy , we see, govern it. And these, as free as we suppose 'em, are often chang'd, we know not how, without asking our consent, or giving us any account. If Opinion be that which governs, and makes the change; 'tis it-self as liable to be govern'd, and vary'd in its turn. And by what I can observe of the World, Fancy and Opinion stand pretty much upon the same bottom. So that if there be no certain Inspector or Auditor establish'd within us, to take account of these Opinions and Fancys in due Form, and minutely to animadvert upon their several Growths and Habits, we are as little like to continue a Day in the same Will , as a Tree, during a Summer, in the same Shape , without the Gardner's assistance, and the vigorous application of the Shears and Pruning- knife. full as formidable a one, erected in our-selves; if we wou'd pretend to that Uniformity of Opinion which is necessary to hold us to one Will , and preserve us in the same Mind, from one day to another. Philosophy, at this rate, will be thought perhaps little better than Persecution. And a Supreme Judg in matters of Inclination and Appetite, must needs go exceedingly against the Heart. Every pretty Fancy is disturb'd by it: Every Pleasure interrupted by it. The Course of good Humour will hardly allow it: And the Pleasantry of Wit almost absolutely rejects it. It appears besides, like a kind of Pedantry, to be thus magisterial with our-selves; thus strict over our Imaginations, and with all the airs of a real Pedagogue to be sollicitously taken up in the four Care and Tutorage of so many boyish Fancys, unlucky Appetites and Desires, which are perpetually playing truant, and need Correction. Arcanum , which we have profess'd to reveal, this Regimen or Discipline of the Fancys may not in the end prove so severe or mortifying as is imagin'd. We hope also that our Patient (for such we naturally suppose our Reader ) will consider duly with himself, that what he endures in this Operation is for no inconsiderable End: since 'tis to gain him a Will , and insure him a certain Resolution ; by which he shall know where to find himself; be sure of his own Meaning and Design; and as to all his Desires, Opinions, and Inclinations, be warranted one and the same Person to day as yesterday, and tomorrow as today. Nature of Mankind, and the Growth, Variation, and Inflection of Appetite and Humour. For Appetite , which is elder Brother to Reason , being the Lad of stronger Growth, is sure, on every contest, to take the advantage of drawing all to his own side. And Will , so highly boasted, is but at best, a Foot-Ball or Top between these Youngsters, who prove very unfortunately match'd; till the youngest, instead of now and then a Kick or Lash bestow'd to little purpose, forsakes the Ball or Top it-self, and begins to lay about his elder Brother. 'Tis then that the Scene changes. For the elder, like an arrant Coward, upon this treatment, presently grows civil, and affords the younger as fair Play afterwards as he can desire. Rhetorick, the Mind apostrophizes its own Fancys , raises'em in their proper Shapes and Personages , and addresses 'em familiarly, without the least Ceremony or Respect. By this means it will soon happen that Two form'd Partys will erect themselves within. For the Imaginations or Fancys being thus roundly treated, are forc'd to declare themselves, and take Party. Those on the side of the elder Brother Appetite , are strangely subtile and insinuating. They have always the Faculty to speak by Nods and Winks. By this practice they conceal half their meaning, and like modern Politicians pass for deeply wise, and adorn themselves with the finest Pretexts and most specious Glosses imaginable; till being confronted with their Fellows of a plainer Language and Expression, they are forc'd to quit their mysterious Manner, and discover themselves mere Sophisters and Impostors , who have not the least to do with the Party of Reason and good Sense. the Form and Manner of this Probation , or Exercise , as it regards all Men in general. But the Case of Authors , in particular, being, as we apprehend, the most urgent; we shall apply our Rule in the first place to these Gentlemen, whom it so highly imports to know themselves, and understand the natural Strength and Powers , as well as the Weaknesses of a human Mind. For without this Understanding, the Historian's Judgment will be very defective; the Politician's Views very narrow, and chimerical; and the Poet's Brain, however stock'd with Fiction, will be but poorly furnish'd; as in the sequel we shall make appear. He who deals in Characters , must of necessity know his own ; or he will know nothing. And he who wou'd give the World a profitable Entertainment of this sort, shou'd be sure to profit, first, by himself. For in this sense, Wisdom as well as Charity may be honestly said to begin at home. There is no way of estimating Manners , or apprizing the different Humours, Fancys, Passions and Apprehensions of others, without first taking an Inventory of the same kind of Goods within ourselves, and surveying our domestick Fund. A little of this Home -Practice will serve to make great Discoverys. Tecum habita, & noris quam sit tibi curta supellex. Pers. Sat. 4. of necessity have discover'd the great difference in this respect between such Persons as have been taught by Nature only, and such as by Reflection, and the assistance of Art, have learnt to form those Motions which on experience are found the easiest and most natural. Of the former kind are either those good Rusticks , who have been bred remote from the form'd Societys of Men; or those plain Artizans , and People of lower Rank, who living in Citys and Places of resort, have been necessitated however to follow mean Imployments, and wanted the Opportunity and Means to form themselves after the better Models. There are some Persons indeed so happily form'd by Nature herself, that with the greatest simplicity or rudeness of Education, they have still something of a natural Grace and Comeliness in their Action: And there are others of a better Education, who by a wrong Aim and injudicious Affectation of Grace, are of all People the farthest remov'd from it. 'Tis undeniable however, that the Perfection of Grace and Comeliness in Action and Behaviour, can be found only among the People of a liberal Education. And even among the graceful of this kind, those still are found the gracefullest, who early in their Youth have learnt their Exercises, and form'd their Motions under the best Masters. such are Philosophers , and Philosophy, to an Author. The Case is the same in the fashionable , and in the literate World. In the former of these 'tis remark'd, that by the help of good Company and the force of Example merely, a decent Carriage is acquir'd, with such apt Motions and such a Freedom of Limbs, as on all ordinary occasions may enable the Party to demean himself like a Gentleman. But when upon further occasion, trial is made in an extraordinary way; when Exercises of the genteeler kind are to be perform'd in publick , 'twill easily appear who of the Pretenders have known Rudiments, and had Masters in private ; and who on the other side have contented themselves with bare Imitation, and learnt only casually and by rote. The Parallel is easily made on the side of Writers. They have at least as much need of learning the several Motions, Counterpoises and Ballances of the Mind and Passions, as the other Students those of the Body and Limbs. 36 Scribendi rect e, sapere est & principium & fons. Rem tibi Socratic ae poterunt ostendere Chart ae. Hor. de Arte Poet. Courtier may a Compliment to the Minister , or the Minister to the Favourite above him, without going such vast Depths into Learning or Philosophy. But for these privileg'd Gentlemen, tho they set Fashions and prescribe Rules in other Cases, they are no Controulers in the Commonwealth of Letters. Nor are they presum'd to write to the Age, or for remote Posterity. Their Works are not of a nature to intitle 'em to hold the Rank of Authors , or be stil'd Writers by way of Excellence in the kind. Shou'd their Ambition lead 'em into such a Field, they wou'd be oblig'd to come otherwise equip'd. They who enter the publick Lists, must come duly train'd, and exercis'd, like well appointed Cavaliers, expert in Arms, and well instructed in the Use of their Weapon, and Management of their Steed. For to be well accoutr'd, and well mounted, is not sufficient. The Horse alone can never make the Horseman : nor Limbs the Wrestler or the Dancer. No more can a Genius alone make a Poet ; or good Parts a Writer , in any considerable kind. The Skill and Grace of Writing is founded, as our wise Poet tells us, in Knowledg and good Sense : And not barely in that Knowledg, which is to be learnt from common Authors, or the general Conversation of the World; but from those particular Rules of Art, which Philosophy alone exhibits. refers, were in themselves a kind of Poetry , like the  37 Mimes , or personated Pieces of early times, before Philosophy was in vogue, and when as yet Dramatical Imitation was scarce form'd, or at least, in many Parts, not brought to due Perfection. They were Pieces which, besides their force of Stile, and hidden Numbers, carry'd a sort of Action and Imitation , the same as the Epick and Dramatick kinds. They were either real Dialogues , or Recitals of such personated Discourses ; where the Persons themselves had their Characters preserv'd throughout; their Manners, Humours, and distinct Turns of Temper and Understanding maintain'd, according to the most exact poetical Truth. 'Twas not enough that these Pieces treated fundamentally of Morals , and in consequence pointed out real Characters and Manners : They exhibited 'em alive , and set the Countenances and Complexions of Men plainly in view. And by this means they not only taught Us to know Others ; but, what was principal and of highest virtue in 'em, they taught us to know Our-selves. their Body and Front, and whose Genius and Manner they were made to represent, was in himself a perfect Character ; yet, in some respects, so veil'd, and in a Cloud, that to the unattentive Surveyor he seem'd often to be very different from what he really was: and this chiefly by reason of a certain exquisite and refin'd Raillery which belong'd to his Manner, and by virtue of which he cou'd treat the highest Subjects, and those of the commonest Capacity both together, and render 'em explanatory of each other. So that in this Genius of writing, there appear'd both the heroick and the simple, the tragick and the comick Vein. However, it was so order'd, that notwithstanding the oddness or mysteriousness of the principal Character, the Under-parts or second Characters shew'd Human Nature more distinctly, and to the Life. We might here, therefore, as in a Looking-Glass , discover our- selves, and see our minutest Features nicely delineated, and suted to our own Apprehension and Cognizance. No one who was ever so little a while an Inspector, but must come acquainted with his own Heart. And, what was of singular note in these magical Glasses ; it wou'd happen, that by constant and long Inspection, the Partys accustom'd to the Practice, wou'd acquire a peculiar speculative Habit ; so as virtually to carry about with 'em a sort of Pocket-Mirrour , always ready, and in use. In this, there were Two Faces which wou'd naturally present themselves to our View: One of them, like the commanding Genius, the Leader and Chief above-mention'd; the other like that rude undisciplin'd and headstrong Creature, whom we our-selves in our natural Capacity most exactly resembled. Whatever we were employ'd in, whatever we set about; if once we had acquir'd the habit of this Mirrour ; we shou'd, by virtue of the double Reflection, distinguish our-selves into two different Partys. And in this Dramatick Method, the Work of Self- Inspection wou'd proceed with admirable Success. their Times, since it appears, they were such well practis'd Dialogists , and accustom'd to this improving Method, before ever Philosophy had adopted it. Their Mimes or characteriz'd Discourses were as much relish'd, as their most regular Poems; and were the Occasion perhaps that so many of these latter were form'd in such Perfection. For Poetry it-self was defin'd an Imitation chiefly of Men and Manners: and was that in an exalted and noble degree, which in a low one we call Mimickry. 'Tis in this that the great  38 Mimographer , the Father and Prince of Poets, excels so highly; his Characters being wrought to a Likeness beyond all that any succeeding Masters were ever able to describe. Nor are his Works, which are so full of Action, any other than an artful Series or Chain of Dialogues , which turn upon one remarkable Catastrophe or Event. He describes no Qualitys or Virtues; censures no Manners; makes no Encomiums, nor gives Characters himself; but brings his Actors still in view. 'Tis they that show themselves. 'Tis they that speak in such a manner as distinguishes 'em in all things from all others, and makes 'em ever like themselves. Their different Compositions and Allays so justly made, and equally carry'd on thro every particle of the Action, give more Instruction than all the Comments or Glosses in the world. The Poet, instead of giving himself those dictating and masterly Airs of Wisdom, makes hardly any Figure at all, and is scarce discoverable in his Poem. This is being truly a Master. He paints so as to need no Inscription over his Figures, to tell us what they are, or what he intends by 'em. A few words let fall, on any slight occasion, from any of the Partys he introduces, are sufficient to denote their Manners, and distinct Character. From a Finger or a Toe, he can represent to our Thoughts the Frame and Fashion of a whole Body. He wants no other help of Art, to personate his Heroes, and make 'em living. All that Tragedy cou'd do after him, was to erect a Stage, and draw his Dialogues and Characters into Scenes; turning, in the same manner, upon one principal Action or Event, with that regard to Place and Time which was sutable to a real Spectacle. Even  39 Comedy it-self was adjudg'd to this great Master, it being deriv'd from those Parodys or Mock-Humours, of which he had given the Specimen in a conceal'd sort of Raillery intermix'd with the Sublime. ---A dangerous Stroke of Art! and which requir'd a masterly Hand, like that of the Philosophical Hero, whose Character was represented in the Dialogue-Writings above- mention'd. many Occasions was heretofore remark'd between the Prince of Poets, and the Divine Philosopher, who was said to rival him, and who together with his Contemporarys of the same School, writ altogether in that manner of Dialogue above-describ'd. From hence too we may comprehend perhaps, why the Study of Dialogue was heretofore thought so advantageous to Writers , and why this manner of Writing was judg'd so difficult, which at first sight, it must be own'd, appears the easiest of any. in Treatises upon most Subjects, with so much Success among the Antients, shou'd be so insipid and of little esteem with us Moderns. But I afterwards perceiv'd, that besides the difficulty of the Manner it-self, and that Mirrour-Faculty , which we have observ'd it to carry in respect of our- selves , it proves also of necessity a kind of Mirrour or Looking-Glass to the Age. If so; it shou'd of consequence (you'l say) be the more agreeable and entertaining. True: if the real View of our-selves be not perhaps displeasing to us. But why more displeasing to Us than to the Antients? Because perhaps they cou'd with just Reason bear to see their natural Countenances represented. And why not We the same? What shou'd discourage us? For are we not as handsom, at least in our own Eyes ? Perhaps not: as we shall see when we have consider'd a little further what the force is of this Mirrour-Writing , and how it differs from that more complaisant modish way, in which an Author, instead of presenting us with other natural Characters, sets off his own with utmost Art, and purchases his Reader's Favour by all imaginable Condescensions. who or what he pleases. He is no certain Man; nor has any certain Character: but sutes himself to the Fancy of his Reader, whom, as the Fashion now is, he constantly caresses and cajoles. All turns upon their two Persons. And as in an Amour, or Commerce of Love-Letters; so here the Author has the Privilege of talking eternally of himself, dressing and sprucing up himself, whilst he is making diligent court, and working upon the Humour of the Party to whom he addresses. This is the Coquetry of a modern Author; whose Epistles Dedicatory, Prefaces, and Addresses to the Reader, are so many affected Graces, design'd to draw the Attention from the Subject, towards Himself ; and make it be generally observ'd, not so much what he says , as what he appears , or is , and what Figure he already makes, or hopes to make, in the fashionable World. particularly in what they call their Memoirs. Their very Essays on Politicks, their Philosophical and Critical Works, their Comments upon antient and modern Authors, all their Treatises are Memoirs. The whole Writing of this Age is become indeed a sort of Memoire-Writing. Tho in the real Memoirs of the Antients, even when they writ at any time concerning themselves, there was neither the I nor Thou throughout the whole Work. So that all this pretty Amour and Intercourse of Caresses between the Author and Reader was thus intirely taken away. annihilated; and the Reader being no way apply'd to, stands for Nobody. The self-interesting Partys both vanish at once. The Scene presents it-self, as by chance, and undesign'd. You are not only left to judg coolly, and with indifference, of the Sense deliver'd; but of the Character, Genius, Elocution, and Manner of the Persons who deliver it. These too are mere Strangers, in whose favour you are no way engag'd. Nor is it enough that the Persons introduc'd speak pertinent and good Sense, at every turn. It must be seen from what bottom they speak; from what Principle , what Stock or Fund of Knowledg they draw; and what Kind or Species of Understanding they possess. For the Understanding here must have its Mark, its characteristick Note, by which it may be distinguish'd. It must be such and such an Understanding ; as when we say, for instance, such or such a Face : since Nature has characteriz'd Tempers and Minds as peculiarly as Faces. And for an Artist who draws naturally, 'tis not enough to shew us merely Faces which may be call'd Men's : Every Face must be a certain Man's. Indians , or any distinct and peculiar People, must of necessity draw the several Figures of his Piece in their proper and real Proportions, Gestures, Habits, Arms, or at least with as fair Resemblance as possible; so in the same manner that Writer, whoever he be, among us Moderns, who shall venture to bring his Fellow-Moderns into Dialogue , must introduce 'em in their proper Manners, Genius, Behaviour and Humour. And this is the Mirrour or Looking- Glass above describ'd. our antient Authors. In it, a poor Philosopher, of a mean Figure, accosts one of the powerfullest, wittiest, handsomest, and richest Noblemen of the time, as he is walking leisurely towards the Temple. You are going then, says he (calling him by his plain Name) to pay your Devotions yonder at the Temple? I am so. But with an Air methinks, as if some Thought perplex'd you. What is there in the Case that shou'd perplex one? The Thought perhaps of your Petitions, and the Consideration what Vows you had best offer to the Deity. Is that so difficult? Can any one be so foolish as to ask of Heaven what is not for his Good ? Not, if he understands what his Good is. Who can mistake it, that has common Sense, and knows the difference between Prosperity and Adversity? 'Tis Prosperity therefore you wou'd pray for. "Undoubtedly. For instance, that Absolute Sovereign, who commands all things by virtue of his immense Treasures, and governs by his sole Will and Pleasure, him you think prosperous , and his State happy. "--- Originals before-mention'd) I see a thousand Ridicules arising from the Manner, the Circumstances and Action it-self, compar'd with modern Breeding and Civility. ---Let us therefore mend the Matter, if possible, and introduce the same Philosopher, addressing himself in a more obsequious manner, to his Grace, his Excellence , or his Honour ; without failing in the least tittle of the Ceremonial. Or let us put the Case more favourably still for our Man of Letters. Let us suppose him to be incognito , without the least appearance of a Character, which in our Age is so little recommending. Let his Garb and Action be of the more modish sort, in order to introduce him better, and gain him Audience. And with these Advantages and Precautions, imagine still in what manner he must accost this Pageant of State, if at any time he finds him at leisure, walking in the Fields alone, and without his Equipage. Consider how many Bows, and simpering Faces! how many Preludes, Excuses, Compliments!---Now put Compliments , put Ceremony into a Dialogue , and see what the Effect will be! we can neither well imitate, nor translate; whatever Pleasure or Profit we may find in reading those Originals. For what shall we do in such a Circumstance? What if the Fancy takes us, and we resolve to try the Experiment in modern Subjects? See the Consequence!---If we avoid Ceremony, we are unnatural: if we use it, and appear as we naturally are, as we salute, and meet, and treat one another; we hate the Sight.---What's this but hating our own Faces ? Is it the Painter's Fault? Shou'd he paint falsly, or affectedly; mix Modern with Antient, join Shapes preposterously, and betray his Art? If not; what Medium is there? What remains for him, but to throw away the Pencil?---No more designing after the Life: no more Mirrour-Writing , or personal Representation of any kind whatever. we can't. And why this? Why, but because we have less Beauty? For so our Looking-Glass can inform us.--- Ugly Instrument! And for this reason to be hated.---Our Commerce and manner of Conversation, which we think the politest imaginable, is such, it seems, as we our-selves can't endure to see represented to the Life. 'Tis here, as in our real Portraitures, particularly those at full Length, where the poor Pencil-man is put to a thousand shifts, whilst he strives to dress us in affected Habits, such as we never wore; because shou'd he paint us in those we really wear, they wou'd of necessity make the Piece to be so much more ridiculous, as it was more natural, and resembling. Sea-Cards , by which the adventuring Genius's of the times were wont to steer their Courses, and govern their impetuous Muse. These were the Chart Æ of our Roman Master-Poet, and these the Pieces of Art, the Mirrours , the Exemplars he bids us place before our Eyes. \------ Vos Exemplaria Gr aeca Nocturn a versate manu, versate diurna. Hor. de Arte Poet. v. 268. the Statuary's and the Painter's , so in this more particularly, that it has its original Draughts and Models for Study and Practice: not for Ostentation, to be shown abroad, or copy'd for publick View. These are the antient Busts ; the Trunks of Statues; the Pieces of Anatomy ; the masterly rough Drawings which are kept within; as the secret Learning, the Mystery, and Fundamental Knowledg of the Art. There is this essential difference however between the Artists of each kind; that they who design merely after Bodys , and form the Graces of this sort, can never, with all their Accuracy, or Correctness of Design, be able to reform themselves, or grow a jot more shapely in their Persons. But for those Artists who copy from another Life, who study the Graces and Perfections of Minds , and are real Masters of those Rules which constitute this latter Science, 'tis impossible they shou'd fail of being themselves improv'd, and amended in their better Part. I Must confess there is hardly any where to be found a more insipid Race of Mortals, than those whom we Moderns are contented to call Poets , for having attain'd the chiming Faculty of a Language, with an injudicious random use of Wit and Fancy. But for the Man, who truly and in a just sense deserves the Name of Poet , and who as a real Master, or Architect in the kind, can describe both Men and Manners , and give to an Action its just Body and Proportions; he will be found, if I mistake not, a very different Creature. Such a Poet is indeed a second Maker : a just Prometheus , under a Whole , coherent and proportion'd in it-self, with due Subjection and Subordinacy of constituent Parts. He notes the Boundarys of the Passions, and knows their exact Tones and Measures ; by which he justly represents them, marks the Sublime of Sentiments and Action, and distinguishes the Beautiful from the Deform'd, the Amiable from the Odious. The Moral Artist, who can thus imitate the Creator, and is thus knowing in the inward Form and Structure of his Fellow-Creature, will hardly, I presume, be found unknowing in Himself , or at a loss in those Numbers which make the Harmony of a Mind. For Knavery is mere Dissonance and Disproportion. And tho Villains may have strong Tones and natural Capacitys of Action; 'tis impossible that  40 true Judgment and Ingenuity shou'd reside, where Harmony and Honesty have no being. shewn their chief Foundation and Strength, their preparatory Discipline, and qualifying Method of Self-Examination ; 'tis fit, e'er we disclose this Mystery any further, we shou'd consider of the Advantages or Disadvantages our Authors may possibly meet with, from abroad : and how far their Genius may be depress'd or rais'd by any external Causes, arising from the Humour or Judgment of the World. the Grandees and Men in Power , the Criticks and Men of Art , or the People themselves, the common Audience , and mere Vulgar. We shall begin therefore with the Grandees , and pretended Masters of the World: taking the liberty, in favour of Authors, to bestow some Advice also on these high Persons; if possibly they are dispos'd to receive it in such a familiar way as this. without regard to Counsel, or the rigid Method of Rule and Precept; it must be acknowledg'd nevertheless, that the good and laudable Custom of asking Advice , is still upheld, and kept in fashion, as a matter of fair Repute, and honourable Appearance: Insomuch that even Monarchs, and absolute Princes themselves, disdain not, we see, to make profession of the Practice. publick Occasions, to make use of the noted Stile of WE and US. Not that they are suppos'd to have any Converse with Themselves , as being endow'd with the Privilege of becoming Plural , and enlarging their Capacity, in the manner above describ'd. Single and absolute Persons in Government, I'm sensible, can hardly be consider'd as any other than single and absolute in Morals. They have no Inmate Controuler to cavil with 'em, or dispute their Pleasure. Nor have they, from any Practice abroad , been able at any time to learn the way of being free and familiar with themselves, at home. Inclination and Will in such as these, admit as little Restraint or Check in private Meditation as in publick Company. The World, which serves as a Tutor to Persons of an inferior rank, is submissive to these Royal Pupils ; who from their earliest days are us'd to see even their Instructors bend before 'em, and hear every thing applauded which they themselves perform. Favourite, shou'd be presum'd to influence 'em, when they come to years of princely Discretion, and are advanc'd to the Helm of Government; it has been esteem'd a necessary Decency to summon certain Advisers by Profession , to assist as Attendants to the single Person , and be join'd with him in his written Edicts, Proclamations, Letters-Patent, and other Instruments of Regal Power. For this use Privy-Counsellors have been erected; who being Persons of considerable Figure and wise Aspect, cannot be suppos'd to stand as Statues or mere Cyphers in the Government, and leave the Royal Acts erroneously and falsly describ'd to us in the Plural Number; when at the bottom a single Will or Fancy was the sole Spring and Motive. unadvisedly and wilfully in their national Affairs: But 'tis known to be far otherwise with the legal and just Princes of our Island. They are surrounded with the best of Counsellors , the Laws. They administer Civil Affairs by Legal Officers, who have the Direction of their Publick Will and Conscience; and they annually receive Advice and Aid , in the most effectual manner, from their good People. To this wise Genius of our Constitution we may be justly said to owe our wisest and best Princes; whose High Birth or Royal Education cou'd not alone be suppos'd to have given 'em that happy Turn: since by experience we find, that those very Princes, from whose Conduct the World abroad, as well as We at home, have reap'd the greatest Advantages, were such as had the most controverted Titles; and in their youth had stood in the remoter Prospects of Regal Power, and liv'd the nearest to a private Life. have been eminent in the Practice of applying it to others. They have listed themselves Advisers in form, and by publishing their admonitory Works, have added to the number of those, whom in this Treatise we have presum'd to criticize. But our Criticism being withal an Apology for Authors , and a Defence of the literate Tribe; it cannot be thought amiss in us, to join the Royal with the Plebeian Penmen, in this common Cause. ' Twou'd be a hard Case indeed, shou'd the Princes of our Nation refuse to countenance the industrious Race of Authors ; since their Royal Ancestors, and Predecessors, have had such Honour deriv'd to 'em from this Profession. 'Tis to this they owe that bright Jewel of their Crown, purchas'd by a warlike Prince; who having assum'd the Author , and essay'd his Strength in the polemick Writings of the School-Divines, thought it an Honour on this account to retain the Title of Defender of the faith. Arms and martial Discipline to the Gown ; and confiding in his princely Science and profound Learning, made his Stile and Speech the Nerve and Sinew of his Government. He gave us his Works full of wise Exhortation and Advice to his Royal Son, as well as of Instruction to his good People; who cou'd not but admire their Author -Sovereign, thus studious and contemplative in their behalf. 'Twas then, one might have seen our Nation growing young and docile, with that Simplicity of Heart, which qualify'd 'em to profit like a Scholar -People under their Royal Preceptor. For with abundant Eloquence he graciously gave Lessons to his Parliament, tutor'd his Ministers, and edify'd the greatest Church-men and Divines themselves; by whose Suffrage he obtain'd the highest Appellations that cou'd be merited by the acutest Wit, and truest Understanding. From hence the British Nations were taught to own in common a Solomon for their joint-Sovereign, the Founder of their late compleated Union. Nor can it be doubted that the pious Treatise of Self-Discourse ascrib'd to the succeeding Monarch, contributed in a great measure to his glorious and never-fading Titles of Saint , and Martyr. Author-Character to our future Princes. Whatever Crowns or Laurels their renown'd Predecessors may have gather'd in this Field of Honour; I shou'd think that, for the future, the speculative Province might more properly be committed to private Heads. 'Twou'd be a sufficient Encouragement to the Learned World, and a sure Earnest of the Increase and Flourishing of Letters in our Nation, if its Sovereigns wou'd be contented to be the Patrons of Wit, and vouchsafe to look graciously on the ingenious Pupils of Art. Or were it the Custom of their Prime-Ministers, to have any such regard; it wou'd of it-self be sufficient to change the Face of Affairs. A small degree of Favour wou'd insure the Fortunes of a distress'd and ruinous Tribe, whose forlorn Condition has help'd to draw Disgrace upon Arts and Sciences , and kept 'em far off from that Politeness and Beauty, in which they wou'd soon appear, if the aspiring Genius of our Nation were forwarded by the least Care or Culture. to engage our Grandees in the Patronage of Arts and Letters. For in our Nation, upon the foot Things stand, and as they are likely to continue; 'tis not difficult to foresee that Improvements will be made in every Art and Science. The Muses will have their Turn; and with or without their M aecenas's will grow in Credit and Esteem; as they arrive to greater Perfection, and excel in every kind. There will arise such Spirits as wou'd have credited their Court- Patrons, had they found any so wise as to have sought 'em out betimes, and contributed to their rising Greatness. settled between our Prince and People, as has firmly secur'd our hitherto precarious Libertys, and remov'd from us the Fear of Civil Commotions, Wars and Violence, either on account of Religion and Worship, the Property of the Subject, or the contending Titles of the Crown. But as the greatest Advantages of this World are not to be bought at easy Prices; we are still at this moment expending both our Blood and Treasure, to secure to our-selves this inestimable Purchase of our Free Government and National Constitution. And as happy as we are in this Establishment at home; we are still held in a perpetual Alarm by the Aspect of Affairs abroad, and by the Terror of that Power, which e'er Mankind had well recover'd the Misery of those barbarous Ages consequent to the Roman Yoke, has again threaten'd the World with a Universal Monarchy, and a new Abyss of Ignorance and Superstition. especially being as yet in their mere Infant-State. They have hitherto scarce arriv'd to any thing of Shapeliness or Person. They lisp as in their Cradles: and their stammering Tongues, which nothing but their Youth and Rawness can excuse, have hitherto spoken in wretched Pun and Quibble. Our Dramatick preserve this Stile. And even a latter Race, scarce free of this Infirmity, and aiming at a false Sublime , with crouded Simile , and mix'd Metaphor (the Hobby-Horse, and Rattle of the Muses ) entertain our raw Fancy, and unpractis'd Ear; which has not as yet had leisure to form it-self, and become 41 truly musical. and Age, have provided us however with the richest Oar. To their eternal Honour they have withal been the first of Europeans , who since the of jingling Rhyme. They have asserted antient Poetick Liberty , and have happily broken the Ice for those who are to follow 'em; and who treading in their Footsteps, may at leisure polish our Language, lead our Ear to finer Pleasure, and find out the true Rhythmus , and harmonious Numbers, which alone can satisfy a just Judgment, and Muse-like Apprehension. Nation; of whom, however, it must be confess'd, that with truer Pains and Industry, they have sought Politeness , and study'd to give the Muses their due Body and Proportion, as well as the natural Ornaments of Correctness, Chastity, and Grace of Stile. From the plain Model of the Antients they have rais'd a noble  42 Satyrist. In the Epick Kind their Attempts have been less successful. In the Dramatick they have been so happy as to raise their Stage to as great Perfection, as the Genius of their Nation will permit. But the high Spirit of Tragedy can ill subsist where the Spirit of Liberty is wanting. The Genius of this Poetry consists in the lively Representation of the Disorders and Misery of the Great ; to the end that the People and those of a lower Condition may be taught the better to content themselves with Privacy, enjoy their safer State, and prize the Equality and Justice of their Guardian Laws . If this be found agreeable to the just Tragick Model , which the Antients have deliver'd to us; 'twill easily be conceiv'd how little proportion'd it is to the Capacity or Taste of those, who in a long Series of Degrees, from the lowest Peasant to the high Slave of Royal Blood, are taught to idolize the next in Power above 'em, and think nothing so adorable as that unlimited Greatness, and Tyrannick Power, which is rais'd at their own Expence, and exercis'd over themselves. particular; and what effect its establish'd Liberty will produce in every thing that relates to Art ; when Peace returns to us on these happy Conditions. 'Twas the Fate of Rome to have scarce an intermediate Age, or single Period of Time, between the Rise of Arts and Fall of Liberty. No sooner had that Nation begun to lose the Roughness and Barbarity of their Manners, and learn of Greece to form their Heroes , their Orators and Poets on a right Model, than by their unjust Attempt upon the Liberty of the World, they justly lost their own. With their Liberty they lost not only their Force of Eloquence, but even their Stile and Language it-self. The Poets who afterwards arose amongst them, were mere unnatural and forc'd Plants. Their Two most accomplish'd, who came last, and clos'd the Scene, were plainly such as had seen the Days of Liberty, and felt the sad Effects of its Departure. Nor had these been ever brought in play, but by the Friendship of the fam'd M Æcenas , who turn'd a  43 Prince naturally cruel and barbarous to the Love and Courtship of the taught him how to charm Mankind. They were more to him than his Arms or military Virtue; and, more than Fortune herself, assisted him in his Greatness, and made his usurp'd Dominion so enchanting to the World, that it cou'd see without regret its Chains of Bondage firmly riveted. The corrupting Sweets of such a poisonous Government were not indeed long-liv'd. The Bitter soon succeeded. And, in the issue, the World was forc'd to bear with Patience those natural and genuine Tyrants, who succeeded to this specious Machine of Arbitrary and Universal Power. Periods of Government, and the flourishing and decay of Liberty and Letters ; I can't be contented to consider merely of the Inchantment which wrought so powerfully upon Mankind, when first this Universal Monarchy was establish'd. I must wonder still more, when I consider how after the extinction of this C aesarean and Claudian Family, and a short interval of Princes rais'd and destroy'd with much Disorder and publick Ruin, the Romans shou'd regain their perishing Dominion, and retrieve their sinking State, by an after-Race of wise and able Princes successively adopted, and taken from a private State to rule the Empire of the World. They were Men who not only possess'd the military Virtues, and supported that sort of Discipline in the highest degree; but as they sought the Interest of the World, they did what was in their power to restore Liberty , and raise again the perishing Arts , and decay'd Virtue of Mankind. But the Season was now past! The fatal Form of Government was become too natural: And the World, which had bent under it, and was become slavish and dependent, had neither Power nor Will to help it-self. The only Deliverance it cou'd expect, was from the merciless hands of the Barbarians , and a total Dissolution of that enormous Empire and Despotick Power, which the best Hands cou'd not preserve from being destructive to human Nature. For even Barbarity and Gothicism were already enter'd into Arts, e'er the Savages had made any Impression on the Empire. All that a fortuitous and almost miraculous Succession of good Princes cou'd avail, towards the Support of Arts and Sciences, was no more than to preserve during their own time those perishing Remains, which for a while with difficulty subsisted after the Decline of Liberty. Not a Statue, not a Medal, not a tolerable Piece of Architecture cou'd shew it-self afterwards. Philosophy, Wit and Learning, in which some of those good Princes had themselves been so renown'd, fell with them, and Ignorance and Darkness overspread the World, and fitted it for the Chaos and Ruin which ensu'd. we are our-selves the happy Nation, who not only enjoy it at home, but by our Greatness and Power give Life and Vigour to it abroad; and are the Head and Chief of the European League , founded on this common Cause. Nor is it to be fear'd that we shou'd lose this noble Ardour, or faint under the glorious Toil; tho, like antient Greece , we shou'd for succeeding Ages be contending with a foreign Power, and endeavouring to reduce the Exorbitancy of a Grand Monarch. 'Tis with us at present, as with the Roman People in those  44 early Days, when they wanted only repose from Arms to apply themselves to the Improvement of Arts and Studys. We shou'd, in this case, need no ambitious Monarch to be allur'd, by hope of Fame or secret views of Power, to give Pensions abroad, as well as at home, and purchase Flattery from every Profession and Science. We shou'd find a better Fund within ourselves, and shou'd without such Assistance be able to excel, by our own Virtue and Emulation. Princes , wou'd they freely help in this Affair; and by a judicious Application of their Bounty, facilitate this happy Birth, of which I have ventur'd to speak in a prophetick Stile. 'Twou'd be of no small advantage to 'em during their Life; and wou'd more than all their other Labours procure 'em an immortal Memory. For they must remember that their Fame is in the hands of Penmen : and that the greatest Actions lose their Force, and perish in the custody of unable and mean Writers. Rhapsoders, Historiographers, Antiquarys of some kind or other, whose business it will be to recount its remarkable Transactions, and record the Atchievements of its Civil and Military Heroes. And tho the Military Kind may happen to be the furthest remov'd from any acquaintance with Letters , or the Muses ; they are yet, in reality, the most interested in the Cause and Party of these Remembrancers. The greatest share of Fame and Admiration falls naturally on the arm'd Worthys. The Great in Council are second in the Muses Favour. But if worthy Poetick Genius's are not found, nor able Penmen rais'd, to rehearse the Lives, and celebrate the high Actions of great Men, they must be traduc'd by such Recorders as Chance presents. We have few modern Heroes, who like Xenophon or C aesar can write their own Commentarys. And the raw Memoire \- Writings and unform'd Pieces of modern Statesmen, full of their interested and private Views, will in another Age be of little service to support their Memory or Name; since already the World begins to sicken with the Kind. 'Tis the learn'd, the able, and disinterested Historian , who takes place at last. And when the signal Poet , or Herald of Fame is once heard, the inferior Trumpets sink in Silence and Oblivion. absolutely unconcern'd for his Memory, or what came after him; yet for the present merely, and during his own time, it must be of importance to him to stand fair with the Men of Letters and Ingenuity, and to have the Character and Repute of being favourable to their Art. Be the illustrious Person ever so high or awful in his Station; he must have Descriptions made of him, in Verse, and Prose, under feign'd, or real Appellations. If he be omitted in sound Ode , or lofty Epick ; he must be sung at least in Doggrel and plain Ballad. The People will needs have his Effigies ; tho they see his Person ever so rarely: And if he refuses to sit to the good Painter, there are others who, to oblige the Publick, will take the Design in hand. We shall take up with what presents; and rather than be without the illustrious Physiognomy of our great Man, shall be contented to see him portraitur'd by the Artist who serves to illustrate Prodigys in Fairs , and adorn heroick Sign-Posts. The ill Paint of this kind cannot, it's true, disgrace his Excellence; whose Privilege it is, in common with the Royal Issue, to be rais'd to this degree of Honour, and to invite the Passenger or Traveller by his signal Representative. 'Tis suppos'd in this Case, that there are better Pictures current of the Hero; and that such as these, are no true or favourable Representations. But in another sort of Limning there is great danger lest the Hand shou'd disgrace the Subject. Vile Encomiums , and wretched Panegyricks are the worst of Satyrs : And when sordid and low Genius's make their Court successfully in one way, the Generous and Able are aptest to revenge it in another. if possible, to suppress Letters ; or give a helping hand towards their Support. Wherever the Author -Practice and Liberty of the Pen has in the least prevail'd, the Governors of the State must be either considerable Gainers, or Sufferers by its means. So that 'twou'd become them either, by a right Turkish Policy, to strike directly at the Profession , and overthrow the very Art and Mystery it-self, or with Alacrity to support and encourage it, in the right manner, by a generous and impartial regard to Merit. To act narrowly, or by halves; or with Indifference, and Coolness; or fantastically and by Humour merely; will scarce be found to turn to their account. They must do Justice; that Justice may be done them, in return. 'Twill be in vain for our Alexanders to give order that none but a draw their Picture. Insolent Intruders will do themselves the Honour to practise on the Features of these Heroes. And a vile Ch aerilus , after all, shall with their own Consent perhaps, supply the room of a deserving and noble Artist. Distributers or Dispensers of Rewards, they expect it of their Princes and Great Men , that they shou'd supply the generous Part; and bestow Honour and Advantages on those from whom the Nation it-self may receive Honour and Advantage. 'Tis expected that they who are high and eminent in the State , shou'd not only provide for its necessary Safety and Subsistence, but omit nothing that may contribute to its Dignity and Honour. The Arts and Sciences must not be left Patron-less. The Publick it-self will join with the good Wits and Judges, in the resentment of such a Neglect. 'Tis no small advantage, even in an Absolute Government , for a Ministry to have Wit on their side, and engage the Men of Merit in this kind to be their Well-wishers and Friends. And in those States where ambitious Leaders often contend for the Supreme Authority, 'tis a considerable advantage to the ill Cause of such Pretenders, when they can obtain a Name and Interest with the Men of Letters. The good Emperor Trajan , tho himself no mighty Scholar, had his due as well as an Augustus ; and was as highly celebrated for his Munificence, and just Encouragement of every Art and Virtue. And C aesar , who cou'd write so well himself, and maintain'd his Cause by Wit as well as Arms, knew experimentally what it was to have even a Catullus his Enemy: And tho lash'd so often in his Lampoons, continu'd to forgive and court him. The Traitor knew the Importance of this Mildness. May none who have the same Designs, understand so well the Advantages of such a Conduct! I wou'd have requir'd but this one Defect in C aesar's Generosity, to have been secure of his never rising to Greatness, or enslaving his native Country. Let him but have shewn a Ruggedness and Austerity towards free Genius's, or a Neglect or Contempt towards Men of Wit; let him have trusted to his Arms , and declar'd against Arts and Letters ; and he wou'd have prov'd a second Marius , or a Catiline of meaner Fame, and Character. in regard of their high Stations they may be esteem'd to pay a sufficient Tribute to Letters, and discharge themselves as to their own part in particular, if they chuse indifferently any Subject for their Bounty, and are pleas'd to confer their Favour either on some one Pretender to Art, or promiscuously to such of the Tribe of Writers, whose chief Ability has lain in making their Court well, and obtaining to be introduc'd to their Acquaintance. This they think sufficient to instal them Patrons of Wit , and Masters of the literate Order. But this Method will of any other the least serve their Interest or Design. The ill placing of Rewards is a double Injury to Merit; and in every Cause or Interest, passes for worse than mere Indifference or Neutrality. There can be no Excuse for making an ill Choice. Merit in every kind is easily discover'd, when sought. The Publick it-self fails not to give sufficient Indication; and points out those Genius's who want only Countenance and Encouragement to become considerable. An ingenious Man never starves unknown: and Great Men must wink hard, or 'twou'd be impossible for 'em to miss such advantageous Opportunitys of shewing their Generosity, and acquiring tho universal Esteem, Acknowledgments, and good Wishes of the ingenious and learned part of Mankind. Grandees in matters of Art, and Letters, will easily be gather'd from the Reflections already made. It may appear from the very Freedom we have taken in censuring these Men of Power , what little reason Authors have to plead 'em as their Excuse for any Failure in the Improvement of their Art and Talent. For in a free Country, such as ours, there is not any Order or Rank of Men, more free than that of Writers : who if they have real Ability and Merit, can fully right themselves when injur'd; and are ready furnish'd with Means, sufficient to make themselves consider'd by the Men in highest Power. Meanness and Insufficiency on the account of this Low-spiritedness which they discover; were it not for another sort of Fear, by which they more plainly betray themselves, and seem conscious of their own Defect. The Criticks , it seems, are formidable to 'em. The Criticks are the dreadful Specters , the Giants , the Enchanters , who traverse and disturb 'em in their Works. These are the Persecutors, for whose sake they are ready to hide their head; begging Rescue and Protection of all good People; and flying in particular to the Great , by whose Favour they hope to be defended from this merciless examining Race. "For what can be more cruel than to be forc'd to submit to the rigorous Laws of Wit , and write under such severe Judges as are deaf to all Courtship, and can be wrought upon by no Insinuation or Flattery to pass by Faults, and pardon any Transgression of Art ?" of his  45 Prefaces, Dedications , and Introductions , one wou'd think that at the moment when a Piece of his was in hand, some Conjuration was forming against him, some Diabolical Powers drawing together to blast his Work, and cross his generous Design. He therefore rouzes his Indignation, hardens his Forehead, and with many furious Defiances and Avant Satans ! enters on his Business: not with the least regard to what may justly be objected to him in a way of Criticism ; but with an absolute contempt of the Manner and Art itself. Defiance. The Avant ! was natural and proper in its place; especially where Religion and Virtue were the Poet's Theme. But with our Moderns the Case is generally the very Reverse. And accordingly the Defiance or Avant shou'd run much after this manner: "As for you vulgar Souls, mere Naturals , who know no Art , were never admitted into the Temple of Wisdom, nor ever visited the Sanctuarys of Wit or Learning, gather your-selves together from all Parts, and hearken to the Song or Tale I am about to utter. But for you Men of Science and Understanding, who have Ears and Judgment, and can weigh Sense, scan Syllables, and measure Sounds: You who by a certain Art distinguish false Thought from true, Correctness from Rudeness , and Bombast and Chaos from Order and the Sublime ; Away hence! or stand aloof! whilst I practise upon the Easiness of those mean Capacitys and Apprehensions, who make the most numerous Audience, and are the only competent Judges of my Labours." different Times and Seasons. 'Tis at present the Boast of almost every Enterprizer in the Muse's Art, "That by his Genius alone, and a natural Rapidity of Stile and Thought, he is able to carry all before him; that he plays with his Business, does things in passing, at a venture, and in the quickest period of Time." In the Days of Attick Elegance , as Works were then truly of another Form and Turn, so Workmen were of another Humour, and had their Vanity of a quite contrary kind. They became rather affected in endeavouring to discover the Pains they had taken to be correct. They were glad to insinuate how laboriously, and with what expence of Time, they had brought the smallest Work of theirs (as perhaps a single Ode or Satyr , an Oration or Panegyrick ) to its perfection. When they had so polish'd their Piece, and render'd it so natural and easy, that it seem'd only a lucky Flight, a hit of Thought, or flowing Vein of Humour; they were then chiefly concern'd lest it shou'd in reality pass for such, and their Artifice remain undiscover'd. They were willing it shou'd be known how serious their Play was; and how elaborate their Freedom and Facility: that they might say as the agreeable and polite Poet, glancing on himself, Ludentis speciem dabit & torquebitur \--- Hor. Epist. 2. Lib. 2. And, \--- --- --- Vt sibi quivis Speret idem; sudet multum, frustraque laboret Ausus idem: tantum series juncturaque pollet. Id. de Arte Poet. upon a vulgar Judgment. Nothing grieves a real Artist more than that Indifference of the Publick, which suffers Work to pass uncriticiz'd. Nothing, on the other side, rejoices him more than the nice View and Inspection of the accurate Examiner and Judg of Work. 'Tis the mean Genius , the slovenly Performer, who knowing nothing of true Workmanship , endeavours by the best outward Gloss and dazling Shew, to turn the Eye from a direct and steddy Survey of his Piece. perform his Part in the presence of those who are knowing in his Art? 'Tis to the Ear alone, that he applies himself, the critical , the nice Ear. Let his Hearers be of what Character they please: Be they naturally austere, morose, or rigid; no matter, so they are but Criticks , able to censure, remark, and sound every Accord and Symphony. What is there mortifies the good Painter more, than when amidst his admiring Spectators there is not one present, who has been us'd to compare the Hands of different Masters, or has an Eye to distinguish the Advantages or Defects of every Stile? Thro all the inferiour Orders of Mechanicks , the Rule is found to hold the same. In every Science, every Art, the real Masters or Prosicients , rejoice in nothing more, than in the thorow Search and Examination of their Performances, by all the Rules of Art and nicest Criticism. Why therefore (in the Muses Name!) is it not the same with our Pretenders to the Writing Art, our Poets , and Prose-Authors in every kind? Why in this Profession are we found such Critick-Haters , and indulg'd in this unlearned Aversion; unless it be taken for granted, that as Wit and Learning stand at present in our Nation, we are still upon the foot of Empiricks and Mountebanks ? fashionable and prevailing Custom of inveighing against Criticks , as the common Enemys, the Pests, and Boutefeus of the Commonwealth of Wit and Letters. I assert, on the contrary, that they are the Props and Pillars of this Building; and that without their Encouragement and Propagation, we shall remain still as Gothick Architects as ever. compos'd of federate Tribes , or mixt Colonys , scarce settled in their new Seats, it might pass for sufficient good Fortune, if the People prov'd but so far Masters of Language as to be able to understand one another, in order to confer about their Wants, and provide for their common Necessitys. Their expos'd and indigent State cou'd not be presum'd to afford 'em either that full Leisure, or easy Disposition which was requisite to raise 'em to any Curiosity of Speculation. They who were neither safe from Violence, nor secure of Plenty, were unlikely to engage in unnecessary Arts. Nor cou'd it be expected they shou'd turn their Attention towards the Numbers of their Language, and the harmonious Sounds which they accidentally emitted. But when, in process of time, the Affairs of the Society were settl'd on an easy and secure Foundation; when Debates and Discourses on these Subjects of common Interest, and publick Good, were grown familiar; and the Speeches of prime Men, and Leaders, were consider'd, and compar'd together; there wou'd naturally be observ'd not only a more agreeable measure of Sound, but a happier, and more easy Rangement of Thoughts, in one Speaker, than in another. must have been in a manner the Mother of Poetry, Rhetorick, Musick , and the other kindred Arts. For 'tis apparent that where chief Men, and Leaders had the strongest Interest to persuade ; they us'd the highest Endeavours to please. So that in such a State or Polity as has been describ'd, not only the best Order of Thought, and Turn of Fancy, but the most soft and inviting Numbers must have been employ'd, to charm the Publick Ear , and to incline the Heart , by the Agreeableness of Expression. represent the first Founders or Establishers of these larger Societys, than as real Songsters , who by the power of their Voice and Lyre, cou'd charm the wildest Beasts, and draw the rude Forests and Rocks into the Form of fairest Citys. Nor can it be doubted that the same Artists , who so industriously apply'd themselves to study the Numbers of Speech , must have made proportionable Improvements in the Study of mere Sounds and natural Harmony ; which, of it-self, must have considerably contributed towards the softning the rude Manners and harsh Temper of their new People. and voluntary Association, that after a while, the Power of One , or of a Few , grew prevalent over the rest; if Force took place, and the Affairs of the Society were administer'd without their Concurrence, by the influence of Awe and Terrour ; it follow'd, that these pathetick Sciences and Arts of Speech were little cultivated, since they were of little use. But where were to be convinc'd before they acted; there Elocution became considerable; there Orators and Bards were heard; and the chief Genius's and Sages of the Nation betook themselves to the Study of those Arts, by which the People were render'd more treatable in a way of Reason and Understanding, and more subject to be led by Men of Science and Erudition. The more these Artists courted the Publick, the more they instructed it. In such Constitutions as these, 'twas the Interest of the Wise and Able, that the Community shou'd be Judges of Ability and Wisdom. The high Esteem of Ingenuity was what advanc'd the Ingenious to the greatest Honours. And they who rose by Science, and Politeness in the higher Arts, cou'd not but promote that Taste and Relish to which they ow'd their Distinction and Pre-eminence. Perfection, by Free Nations ; who from the Nature of their Government, as from a proper Soil, produc'd the generous Plants: whilst the mightiest Bodys, and vastest Empires, govern'd by Force , and a Despotick Power , cou'd, after Ages of Peace and Leisure, produce nothing but what was deform'd and barbarous of the kind. moving the Affections become the Study and Emulation of the forward Wits and aspiring Genius's of the Times; it wou'd necessarily happen that many Genius's of equal Size and Strength, tho less covetous of publick Applause, of Power, or of Influence over Mankind, wou'd content themselves with the Contemplation merely of these enchanting Arts. These they wou'd the better enjoy, the more they refin'd their Taste , and cultivated their Ear. For to all Musick there must be an Ear proportionable. There must be an Art of Hearing found, e'er the performing Arts can have their due Effect, or any thing exquisite in the kind be felt or comprehended. The just Performers therefore in each Art, cou'd not but naturally be the most desirous of improving and refining the publick Ear; which they cou'd no way so well effect as by the help of those latter Genius's , who were in a manner their Interpreters to the People; and who by their Example taught the Publick to discover what was just and excellent in each Performance. cou'd not but come withal into Repute; and being heard with Satisfaction in their turn, were at length tempted to become Authors , and appear in Publick. These were honour'd with the Name of Sophists : A Character which in early times was highly respected. Nor did the gravest Philosophers , who were Censors of Manners, and Criticks of a higher degree, disdain to exert their Criticism in the inferiour Arts; especially in those relating to Speech , and the power of Argument and Persuasion. impose on Mankind, by what was specious and pretending. The Publick wou'd be paid in no false Wit, or jingling Eloquence. Where the Learned Criticks were so well receiv'd, and Philosophers themselves disdain'd not to be of the Number; there cou'd not fail to arise Criticks of an inferiour Order, who wou'd subdivide the several Provinces of this Empire. Etymologists, Philologists, Grammarians, Rhetoricians , and others of considerable note, and eminent in their degree, wou'd every where appear, and vindicate the Truth and Justice of their Art, by revealing the hidden Beautys which lay in the Works of just Performers ; and by exposing the weak Sides, false Ornaments, and affected Graces of mere Pretenders. Nothing that we call Sophistry in Argument, or Bombast in Stile; nothing of the effeminate Kind, or of the false Tender , the pointed Witticism , the disjointed Thought, the crouded Simile , or the mix'd Metaphor , cou'd pass even on the common Ear: whilst the Notarys , the Expositors , and Prompters above-mention'd, were every where at hand, and ready to explode the unnatural Manner. Discourse or Writing, the easiest attain'd, and earliest practis'd, was the Miraculous , the Pompous , or what we generally call the Sublime. Astonishment is of all other Passions the easiest rais'd in raw and unexperienc'd Mankind. Children in their earliest Infancy are entertain'd in this manner: And the known way of pleasing such as these, is to make 'em wonder, and lead the way for 'em in this Passion, by a feign'd Surprize at the miraculous Objects we set before 'em. The best Musick of Barbarians is hideous and astonishing Sounds. And the fine Sights of Indians are enormous Figures, various odd and glaring Colours, and whatever of that sort is amazingly beheld, with a kind of Horrour and Consternation. passes for Sublime , is form'd by the variety of Figures, the multiplicity of  46 Metaphors, and by quitting as much as possible the natural and easy way of Expression, for that which is most unlike to Humanity, or ordinary Use. This the Prince of Criticks assures us to have been the Manner of the earliest Poets, before the Age of Homer ; or till such time as this Father-Poet came into Repute, who depos'd that spurious Race, and gave rise to a legitimate and genuine Kind. He retain'd only what was decent of the figurative or metaphorick Stile, introduc'd the natural and simple , and turn'd his thoughts towards the real Beauty of Composition, the Unity of Design, the Truth of Characters, and the just Imitation of Nature in each particular. divided into several Shares; especially when it came to be copy'd in Dramatick. Tragedy came first; and took what was most Solemn and Sublime. In this part the Poets succeeded sooner than in Comedy or the facetious Kind; as was natural indeed to suppose, since this was in reality the easiest Manner of the two , and capable of being brought the soonest to Perfection. For so the same Prince of Criticks  47 sufficiently informs us. And 'tis highly worth remarking, what this mighty Genius and Judg of Art, declares concerning Tragedy ; that whatever Idea might be form'd of the utmost Perfection of this kind of Poem, it cou'd in Practice rise no higher than it had been already carry'd in his time;  48 "Having at length (says he) attain'd its Ends, and being apparently consummate in it-self:" But for Comedy , it seems, 'twas still in hand. It had been already in some manner reduc'd; but, as he plainly insinuates, it lay yet unfinish'd: notwithstanding the witty Labours of an Aristophanes , and the other comick Poets of the first Manner, who had flourish'd a whole Age before this Critick. As perfect as were those Wits in Stile and Language; and as fertile in all the Varietys and Turns of Humour; yet the Truth of Characters, the Beauty of Order, and the simple Imitation of Nature were in a manner wholly unknown to 'em; or thro Petulancy, or Debauch of Humour, were, it seems, neglected and set aside. A Menander had not as yet appear'd; who arose soon after, to accomplish the Prophecy of our grand Master of Art, and consummate Philologist. had at this time done little more than what the antient  50 Parodys had done before it. 'Twas of admirable use to explode the false Sublime of early Poets, and such as in its own Age were on every occasion ready to relapse into that vicious Manner. The good Tragedians themselves cou'd hardly escape its Lashes. The pompous Orators were its never-failing Subjects. Every thing that might be imposing, by a false Gravity or Solemnity, was forc'd to endure the Trial of this Touchstone. Manners and Characters, as well as Speech and Writings, were discuss'd with the greatest Freedom. Nothing cou'd be better fitted than this Genius of Wit, to unmask the face of things, and remove those Larv ae naturally form'd from the Tragick Manner, and pompous Stile, which had preceded: 51 Et docuit magnumque loqui, nitique Cothurno. Hor. de Arte Poet. ' Twas not by chance that this Succession happen'd in Greece , after the manner describ'd; but rather thro Necessity, and from the Reason and  52 Nature of Things. For in healthy Bodys, Nature dictates Remedys of her own, and provides for the Cure of what has happen'd amiss in the Growth and Progress of a Constitution. The Affairs of this free People being in the Increase; and their Ability and Judgment every day improving, as Letters and Arts advanc'd; they cou'd not but find in themselves a Strength of Nature, which by the help of good Ferments, and a wholesom opposition of Humours, wou'd correct in one way whatever was excessive, or peccant (as Physicians say) in another. Thus the florid and over-sanguine Humour of the high Stile was allay'd by something of a contrary nature. The Comick Genius was apply'd, as a kind of Caustick , to those Exuberances and Fungus's of the swoln Dialect, and magnificent manner of Speech. But after a while, even this Remedy it-self was found to turn into a Disease: as Medicines, we know, grow corrosive, when the fouler Matters on which they wrought are sufficiently purg'd, and the Obstructions remov'd. \--- In vitium Libertas excidit, & Vim Dignam Lege regi. \---  53 Hor. de Arte Poet. this licentious manner of Wit, by Law , was a Violation of the Liberty of the Athenian State, or an Effect merely of the Power of Foreigners; whom it little concern'd after what manner those Citizens treated one another, in their Comedys; or what sort of Wit or Humour they made choice of, for their ordinary Diversions. If upon a change of Government, as during the Usurpation of the Thirty , or when that Nation was humbled at any time, either by a Philip , an Alexander , or an Antipater , they had been forc'd against their Wills , to enact such Laws as these; 'tis certain they wou'd have soon repeal'd 'em, when those Terrors were remov'd (as they soon were) and the People restor'd to their former Libertys. For notwithstanding what this Nation suffer'd outwardly , by several shocks receiv'd from Foreign States; notwithstanding the Dominion and Power they lost abroad , they preserv'd the same Government at home. And how passionately interested they were in what concern'd their Diversions and publick Spectacles; how jealous and full of Emulation in what related to their Poetry, Wit, Musick , and other Arts , in which they excell'd all other Nations; is well known to Persons who have any Comprehension of antient Manners, or been the least conversant in History. and of this gradual Reform in the Commonwealth of Wit, but the real Reform of Taste and Humour in the Commonwealth or Government it-self. Instead of any Abridgment, 'twas in reality an Increase of Liberty , an Enlargement of the Security of Property , and an Advancement of private Ease and personal Safety , to provide against what was injurious to the good Name and Reputation of every Citizen. As this Intelligence in Life and Manners grew greater in that experienc'd People, so the Relish of Wit and Humour cou'd not but in proportion be more refin'd. Thus Greece in general grew more and more polite; and as it advanc'd in this respect, was more averse to the obscene buffooning manner. The Athenians still went before the rest, and led the way in Elegance of every kind. For even their first Comedy was a Refinement upon some irregular Attempts which had been made in that dramatick way. And the grand  54 Critick shews us, that in his own time the Phallica , or scurrilous and obscene Farce , prevail'd still, and had the Countenance of the Magistrate, in some Citys of Greece , who were behind the rest in this Reform of Taste and Manners. Refinement of Stiles and Manners among the Antients, particularly in what concern'd their Stage, is, that this very Case of Prohibition and Restraint, happen'd among the Romans themselves; where no Effects of Foreign Power, or of a Home Tyranny can be pretended. Their Fescennin , and Atellan way of Wit, was in early days prohibited, and Laws made against it, for the Publick's sake , and in regard to the Welfare of the Community : Such Licentiousness having been found in reality contrary to the just Liberty of the People. \--- --- --- --- Doluere cruento Dente lacessiti: fuit intactis quoque Cura Quin etiam Lex Poenaque lata malo que nollet Carmine quemquam Describi. \--- --- Hor. Epist. 1. Lib. 2. grave  55 Historians and Chronologists, produce the Testimony of one of the wisest, and most serious of antient Authors; whose single Authority wou'd be acknowledg'd to have equal Force with that of many concurring Writers. He shews us, that this  56 first form'd Comedy and Scheme of ludicrous Wit, was introduc'd upon the neck of the Sublime . The familiar airy Muse was privileg'd as a sort of Counter-Pedagogue , against the Pomp, and Formality of the more solemn Writers And what is highly remarkable, our Author shews us, that in Philosophy it-self there happen'd, almost at the very same time, a like Succession of Wit and Humour; when in opposition to the sublime Philosopher, and afterwards to his  57 grave Disciple and Successor in the Academy, there arose a Comick Philosophy, in the Person of another Master and other Disciples; who personally, as well as in their Writings, were set in direct opposition to the former: not as differing in  58 Opinions or Maxims, but in their Stile and Manner; in the Turn of Humour, and Method of Instruction. Lineage of Philosophy and that of Poetry ; as deriv'd from their two chief Founders, or Patriarchs; in whose Loins the several Races lay as it were inclos'd. For as  59 the grand poetick Sire was, by the consent of all Antiquity, allow'd to have furnish'd Subject both to the Tragick , the Comick , and every other kind of genuine Poetry; so the Philosophical Patriarch , in the same manner, containing within himself the several Genius's of Philosophy, gave rise to all those several Manners in which that Science was deliver'd. Poetry and Rhetorick, took the Sublime part, and shone above his other Condisciples. He of mean Birth, and poorest Circumstances, whose Constitution as well as Condition inclin'd him most to the Satyrick way, took the reproving part, which in his better humour'd and more agreeable Successor, turn'd into the Comick kind, and went upon the Model of that antient Comedy which was then prevailing. But another noble Disciple, whose Genius was towards Action, and who prov'd afterwards the greatest Hero of his time, took the genteeler Part, and softer Manner. He join'd what was deepest and most solid in Philosophy with what was easiest and most refin'd in Breeding, and in the Character and Manner of a Gentleman. Nothing cou'd be remoter than his Genius was, from the scholastick, the rhetorical, or mere poetick Kind. He was as distant on one hand, from the sonorous, high, and pompous Strain, as on the other hand, from the ludicrous, mimickal, or satyrick. was that natural and simple Genius of Antiquity, comprehended by so few, and so little relish'd by the Vulgar. This was that philosophical Menander of earlier Time, whose Works one may wonder to see preserv'd from the same Fate: since in the darker Ages thro which they pass'd, they cou'd not but be alike neglected, on the account of their like Simplicity of Stile, and Composition. another of considerable Authority and Weight, which had its Rise chiefly from the critical Art it-self, and from the more accurate Inspection into the Works of preceding Masters. The grand Critick, of whom we have already spoken, was a Chief and Leader in this Order of Penmen. For tho the Form ; yet this Writer was the first who gain'd Repute in the methodick Kind. As the Talent of this great Man was more towards polite Learning, and the Arts, than towards the deep and solid parts of Philosophy, it happen'd that in his School there was more care taken of other Sciences, than of Ethicks, Dialect , or Logick ; which Provinces were chiefly cultivated by the Successors of the Academy and Porch. naturally befitted an Author, who, tho endow'd with a comprehensive and strong Genius, was not in himself of a refin'd Temper, bless'd by the Graces , or favour'd by any Muse ; one who was not of a fruitful Imagination, but rather dry and rigid; yet withal acute and piercing, accurate and distinct. For the chief Nerve and Sinew of this Stile consists in the clear Division and Partition of the Subjects. Tho there is nothing exalting in the Manner, 'tis naturally powerful and commanding ; and more than any other, subdues the Mind, and strengthens its Determinations. 'Tis from this Genius that firm Conclusions, and steddy Maxims are best form'd: which if solidly built, and on sure ground, are the shortest and best Guides towards Wisdom and Ability, in every kind; but if defective, or unsound, in the least part, must of necessity lead us to the grossest Absurditys, and stiffest Pedantry and Conceit. and Method, as well as this which, in a peculiar sense, we call the Methodick ; yet it is this Manner alone which professes Method, dissects it- self in Parts, and makes its own Anatomy. The Sublime can no way condescend thus, or bear to be suspended in its impetuous Course. The Comick , or Derisory Manner, is further still from making shew of Method. 'Tis then, if ever, that it presumes to give it-self this wise Air, when its Design is to expose the Thing it-self, and ridicule the Formality and Sophistry so often shelter'd beneath it. The Simple Manner, which being the strictest Imitation of Nature, shou'd of right be the compleatest, in the Distribution of its Parts, and Symmetry of its Whole, is yet so far from making any ostentation of Method, that it conceals the Artifice as much as possible: endeavouring only to express the effect of Art, under the appearance of the greatest Ease and Negligence. And even when it assumes the censuring or reproving part, it does it in the most conceal'd and gentle way. giving Advice, in such a way as this: So little is the general Palat form'd, as yet, to a Taste of real Simplicity . As for the Sublime , tho it be often the Subject of Criticism; it can never be the Manner, or afford the Means. The Way of Form and Method , the didactick or preceptive Manner, as it has been usually practis'd amongst us, and as our Ears have been long accustom'd, has so little Force towards the winning our Attention, that it is apter to tire us, than the Metre of an old Ballad. We no sooner hear the Theme propounded, the Subject divided and subdivided (with first of the first , and so forth, as Order requires) but instantly we begin a Strife with Nature, which otherwise wou'd surprize us in the soft Fetters of Sleep; to the great Disgrace of the Orator, and Scandal of the Audience. The only Manner left, in which Criticism can have its just Force amongst us, is the antient Comick ; of which kind were the first Roman Miscellanys, or Satyrick Pieces: a sort of original Writing of their own, refin'd afterwards by the best Genius, and politest Poet of that Nation; who, notwithstanding, owns the Manner to have been taken from the Greek Comedy above-mention'd. And if our home- Wits wou'd refine upon this Pattern, they might perhaps meet with considerable Success. Criticism , or Method of Refutation, is that which borders most on the Manner of the earliest Greek Comedy. The highly rated  62 burlesque Poem, written on the Subject of our Religious Controversys in the last Age, is a sufficient Token of this kind. And that justly admir'd Piece of 63 Comick Wit, given us some time after, by an Author of the highest Quality, has furnish'd our best Wits in all their Controversys, even in Religion and Politicks, as well as in the Affairs of Wit and Learning, with the most effectual and entertaining Method of exposing Folly, Pedantry, false Reason, and ill Writing. And without some such tolerated manner of Criticism as this, how grosly we might have been impos'd on, and shou'd continue to be, for the future, by many Pieces of dogmatical Rhetorick, and pedantick Wit, may easily be apprehended by those who know any thing of the State of Letters in our Nation, or are in the least fitted to judg of the Manner of the common Poets , or formal Authors of the Times. grosly superstitious, or ignorant, to be alarm'd at this Spirit. For if it be ill manag'd, and with little Wit; it will be destroy'd by something wittier in the kind: If it be witty it-self, it must of necessity advance Wit. appears that the Cause and Interest of Criticks is the same with that of Wit, Learning, and good Sense. without; either by the Frowns or Favour of the Great , or by the Applause or Censure of the Criticks. It remains only to consider, how the People , or World , in general, stand affected towards our modern Pen-men; and what occasion these Adventurers may have of Complaint, or Boast, from their Encounter with the Publick. Artist , in whatever kind, can never but with the greatest Unwillingness and Shame be induc'd to act below his Character, and for mere Interest's sake, be prevail'd with, to prostitute his Art or Science , by performing contrary to its known Rules. Whoever has heard any thing of the Lives of famous Statuarys, Architects , or Painters , will call to mind many Instances of this nature. Or whoever has made any acquaintance with the better sort of Mechanicks , such as are real Lovers of their Art, and Masters in it, must have observ'd their natural Fidelity in this respect. Be they ever so idle, dissolute, or debauch'd; how regardless soever of other Rules; they abhor any Transgression in their Art , and wou'd chuse to lose Customers and starve, rather than by a base Compliance with the World , to act contrary to what they call the Justness and Truth of Work. " Sir , (says a poor Fellow of this kind, to his rich Customer) "You are mistaken in coming to me, for such a piece of Workmanship. Let who will make it for you, as you fancy; I know it to be Wrong. Whatever I have made hitherto, has been true Work. And neither for your sake or any body's else, shall I put my Hand to any other." Opinion , and above the World . This Disposition transfer'd to the whole of Life , perfects a Character, and makes that Probity and Worth which the Learned are often at such a loss to explain. For is there not a Workmanship and a Truth in Actions ? Or is the Workmanship of this kind less becoming, or less worth our notice; that we shou'd not in this Case be as surly at least as the honest Artizan , who has no other Philosophy , than what Nature and his Trade has taught him? wonder to see those who pretend to Skill and Science in a higher kind, have so little regard to Truth , and the Perfection of their Art. One wou'd expect it of our Writers , that if they had real Ability, they shou'd draw the its weak State. We may justly indeed make Allowances for the simplicity of those early Genius's of our Nation, who after so many barbarous Ages, when Letters lay yet in their Ruins, made bold Excursions into a vacant Field, to seize the Posts of Honour, and attain the Stations which were yet unpossess'd by the Wits of their own Country. But since the Age is now so far advanc'd; Learning establish'd; the Rules of Writing stated; and the Truth of Art so well apprehended, and every where confess'd and own'd: 'tis strange to see our Writers as unshapen still and monstrous in their Works, as heretofore. There can be nothing more ridiculous than to hear our Poets , in their Prefaces , talk of Art and Structure; whilst in their Pieces they perform as ill as ever, and with as little regard to those profess'd Rules of Art , as the honest Bards , their Predecessors, who had never heard of any such Rules , or at least had never own'd their Justice or Validity. complying with its first Relish and Appetite; they had not done their Countrymen such Service, nor themselves such Honour as we find they did, by conforming to Truth and Nature. The generous Spirits who first essay'd the Way, had not always the World on their side: but soon drew after 'em the best Judgments ; and soon afterwards the World it-self. They forc'd their Way into it, and by weight of Merit turn'd its Judgment on their side. They form'd their Audience; polish'd the Age; refin'd the publick Ear, and fram'd it right; that in return they might be rightly and lastingly applauded. Nor were they disappointed in their Hope. The Applause soon came, and was lasting; for it was sound. They have Justice done them at this day. They have surviv'd their Nation; and live, tho in a dead Language. The more the Age is enlighten'd, the more they shine. Their Fame must necessarily last as long as Letters; and Posterity will ever own their Merit. confess) by the publick Relish, and current Humour of the Times. They regulate themselves by the irregular Fancy of the World; and frankly own they are preposterous and absurd, in order to accommodate themselves to the Genius of the Age. In our Days the Audience makes the Poet ; and the Bookseller the Author : with what Profit to the Publick , or what Prospect of lasting Fame and Honour to the Writer , let any one who has Judgment imagine. ; it will, I doubt, appear from many Instances, that this Practice is but mere Imposture: Since those Absurditys, which they are the aptest to commit, are far from being delightful or entertaining. We are glad to take up with what our Language can afford us; and by a sort of Emulation with other Nations, are forc'd to cry up such Writers of our own as may best serve us for Comparison. But when we are out of this Spirit; it must be own'd, we are not apt to discover any great Fondness or Admiration of our Authors. Nor have we any, whom by mutual Consent we make to be our Standard. We go to Plays , as to other Shows ; and frequent the Theater, as the Booth. We read Epicks and Dramaticks , as we do Satyrs and Lampoons. For we must of necessity know what Wit as well as what Scandal is stirring. Read we must; let Writers be ever so indifferent. And this perhaps may be some occassion of the Laziness and Negligence of our Authors; who observing this Need, which our Curiosity brings on us, and making an exact Calculation in the way of Trade, to know justly the Quality and Quantity of the publick Demand, feed us thus from hand to mouth; resolving not to over-stock the Market, or be at the pains of more Correctness or Wit than is absolutely necessary to carry on the Traffick. Instruction; which is the Majesty and Life of this kind of writing. Our and abandon'd manner of Praise. The worthy Persons who are the Subjects of it, may well be esteem'd Sufferers by the Manner. And the Publick, whether it will or no, is forc'd to make untoward Reflections, when led to it by such Satyrizing Panegyrists. For in reality the Nerve and Sinew of modern Panegyrick lies in a dull kind of Satyr ; which the Author, it's true, intends shou'd turn to the Advantage of his Subject; but which, if I mistake not, will appear to have a very contrary Effect. a Brother-Author , a Wit , a Hero , a Philosopher , or a Statesman , is to look abroad, to find within the narrow compass of their Learning, some eminent Names of Persons, who answer'd to these Characters in a former time. These they are sure to lash, as they imagine, with some sharp stroke of Satyr. And when they have stripp'd these reverend Personages of all their share of Merit, they think to clothe their Hero with the Spoils. Such is the Sterility of these Encomiasts ! They know not how to praise, but by Detraction. If a Fair-One is to be celebrated, Helen must in comparison be deform'd; Venus herself degraded. That a Modern may be honour'd, some Antient must be sacrific'd. If a Poet is to be extoll'd; down with a with any Hero whatever of Time past. "The Romans knew no Discipline! The Grecians never learnt the Art of War!" Method we have describ'd might perhaps be stil'd the Rule of Dispatch , or the Herculean Law ; by which Encomiasts , with no other Weapon that their single Club , may silence all other Fame, and place their Hero in the vacant Throne of Honour. I wou'd willingly however advise these Celebrators to be a little more moderate in the use of this Club -method. Not that I pretend to ask Quarter for the Antients. But for the sake merely of those Moderns , whom our Panegyrists undertake to praise, I wou'd wish 'em to be a little cautious of comparing Characters. There is no need to call up a Publicola , or a Scipio , an Aristides , or a Cato , to serve as Foils. These were patriots and good Generals in their time, and did their Country honest Service. No offence to any who at present do the same. The Fabricius's , the Æ milius's , the Ghosts shou'd, by this unlucky kind of Enchantment, be rais'd in Mockery and Contempt; they may perhaps prove troublesom in earnest, and cast such Reflections on our Panegyrists , and their modern Patrons , as may be no way for the advantage of either. The well-deserving Antients will have always a strong Party among the Wise and Learned of every Age. And the Memory of foreign Worthys, as well as those of our own Nation, will with Gratitude be cherish'd by the nobler Spirits of Mankind. The Interest of the Dead is not so disregarded, but that in case of violence offer'd 'em, thro partiality to the Living , there are Hands ready prepar'd to make sufficient Reprisals. ' Twas in times when Flattery grew much in fashion, that the Title of Panegyrick was appropriated to such Pieces as contain'd only a profuse and unlimited Praise of some single Person. The antient Panegyricks were no other than merely such Writings , as Authors of every kind recited at the solemn Assemblys of the People. They were the Exercises of the Wits, and Men of Letters, who as well as the Men of bodily Dexterity bore their part at the Olympick , and other National and Panegyrick Games. establish'd by their Laws, are yet by Nature wonderfully inclin'd to the same Panegyrick Exercises. At their Fairs , and during the time of publick Festivals , they perform their rude Olympicks , and shew an Activity, and Address, beyond any other modern People whatever. Their Trials of Skill , it's true, are wholly of the Body , not of the Brain. Nor is it to be wonder'd at, if being left to themselves, and no way assisted by the Laws or Magistrate, their bodily Exercises retain something of the Barbarian Character, or, at least, shew their  64 Manners to hold more of  65 which we allow our People, discover sufficiently our National Taste. And the Baitings and Slaughter of so many sorts of Creatures, tame as well as wild, for Diversion merely, may witness the extraordinary Inclination we have for Amphitheatrical Spectacles. I Know not whether it be from this killing Disposition remark'd in us, that our Satyrists prove such very Slaughtermen; and even our Panegyrick Authors, or Encomiasts , delight so much in the dispatching Method above describ'd: But sure I am, that our  66 Dramatick Poets stand violently affected this way; and delight to make Havock and Destruction of every kind. other gross Irregularitys, both in the Fable and Language of their Pieces; that their Success, which depends chiefly on the Ladys, is never so fortunate, as when this Havock is made on Virtue and good Sense, and their Pieces are exhibited publickly in this monstrous Form. I know not how they can answer it to the Fair Sex, to speak (as they pretend) experimentally , and with such nice Distinction, of their Audience. How far this Excuse may serve 'em in relation to common Amours and Love-Adventures , I will not take upon me to pronounce. But I must own, I have often wonder'd to see our fighting Plays become so much the Entertainment of that tender Sex. Revolutions of Human Kind, the Alterations which happen in Manners, and the Flux and Reflux of Politeness, Wit, and Art; are apt at every turn to make the present Age their Standard, and imagine nothing barbarous or savage, but what is contrary to the Manners of their own Time. The same Gentlemen, had they flourish'd in our Britain at the time when C aesar made his first Descent, wou'd have condemn'd, as a whimsical Critick , the Man who shou'd have made bold to censure our Deficiency of Clothing, and laugh at the blue Cheeks and party-colour'd Skins which were then in fashion with our Ancestors. Such must be the Judgment of those who are only Criticks by Fashion. But to a just Naturalist or Humanist , who knows the Creature Man , and judges of his Growth and Improvement in Society, it appears evidently that we British Men were as barbarous and unciviliz'd in respect of the Romans under a C aesar , as the Romans themselves were in respect of the Grecians , when they invaded that Nation under a Mummius. Antiquity than their Pedegree can carry 'em, are able however to call to mind the different State of Manners in some few Reigns past, when Chivalry was in such repute. The Ladys were then Spectators not only of feign'd Combats and martial Exercises, but of real Duels and bloody Feats of Arms. They sat as Umpires and Judges of the doughty Frays. These were the Saint-Protectrices, to whom the Champions chiefly paid their Vows, and to whom they recommended themselves by these galante Quarrels, and elegant Decisions of Right and Justice. Nor is this Spirit so intirely lost amongst us, but that even at this hour the Fair Sex inspire us still with the Fancy of like Gallantrys. They are the chief Subject of many such civil Turmoils, and remain still the secret influencing Constellation by which we are engag'd to give and ask that Satisfaction , which is peculiar to the fine Gentleman of the Age. For thus a certain Galante of our Court express'd the Case very naturally, when being ask'd by his Friends, why one of his establish'd Character for Courage and good Sense, wou'd answer the Challenge of a Coxcomb; he confess'd, "That for his own Sex, he cou'd safely trust their Judgment: But how shou'd he appear at night before the Maids of Honour ?" different Times and Seasons. For so among the Antients, some have been known tender of the  67 Sex to such a degree, as not to suffer 'em to expose their Modesty, by the View of Masculine Games, or Theatrical Representations of any kind whatever. Others, on the contrary, have introduc'd 'em into their Amphitheaters, and made 'em Sharers in the cruellest Spectacles. People, 'tis evident, we are not altogether so barbarous or Gothick as they pretend. We are naturally no ill Soil; and have musical Parts which might be cultivated with great Advantage, if these Gentlemen wou'd use the Art of Masters in their Composition. They have Power to work upon our better Inclinations, and may know by certain Tokens, that their Audience is dispos'd to receive nobler Subjects , and taste a better Manner , than that which, thro Indulgence to themselves more than to the World , they are generally pleas'd to make their Choice. Success, of late Years, towards a just manner of Writing, both in the heroick and familiar Stile; we have older Proofs of a right Disposition in our People towards the moral and instructive Way. Our  68 old Dramatick Poet may witness for our good Ear and manly Relish. Notwithstanding his natural Rudeness, his unpolish'd Stile, his antiquated Phrase and Wit, his want of Method and Coherence, and his Deficiency in almost all the Graces and Ornaments of this kind of Writing; yet by the Justness of his Moral , the Aptness of many of his Descriptions , and the plain and natural Turn of several of his Characters , he pleases his Audience, and often gains their Ear; without a single Bribe from Luxury or Vice. That  69 Piece of his which appears to have most affected English Hearts, and has perhaps been oftnest acted of any that have come upon our Stage, is almost one continu'd Moral : a Series of deep Reflections, drawn from one Mouth, upon the Subject of one single Accident and Calamity, naturally fitted to move Horrour and Compassion. It may be said, of this Play, if I mistake not, that it has properly but One Character or principal Part. It contains no Adoration or Flattery of the Sex : no ranting at the Gods : no blustring Heroism : nor any thing of that curious mixture of the Fierce and Tender , which makes the hinge of modern Tragedy, and nicely varies it between the Points of Love and Honour. Dramatick , we may observe the moral Genius so naturally prevalent: since our  70 most approv'd Heroick Poem has neither the Softness of Language, nor the fashionable Turn of Wit; but merely solid Thought, strong Reasoning, noble Passion, and a continu'd Thred of Moral Doctrine, Piety, and Virtue to recommend it; we may justly infer, that it is not so much the publick Ear , as the ill Hand and vitious Manner of our Poets, which needs redress. main Preliminary of Self-Study and inward Converse , which we have found so much wanting in the Authors of our Time. They shou'd add the Wisdom of the Heart to the Task and Exercise of the Brain , in order to bring Proportion and Beauty into their Works. That their Composition and Vein of Writing may be natural and free, they shou'd settle Matters, in the first place, with themselves. And having gain'd a Mastery here ; they may easily, with the help of their Genius , and a right use of Art , command their Audience , and establish a good Taste. Subjects of Excuse. We have acquitted the Great Men , their presumptive Patrons; and left 'em to their own Discretion. We have prov'd the apprehended. 'em their last Refuge. Nor do we condemn 'em on their want of Wit or Fancy ; but of Judgment and Correctness ; which can only be attain'd by thorow Diligence, Study , and impartial Censure of themselves. 'Tis  71 can make us knowing in Order and Proportion; and give us the just Tone and Measure of human Passion. Master of the common Topicks of Morality. He must at least be speciously honest, and in all appearance a Friend to Virtue, throout his Poem. The Good and Wife will abate him nothing in this kind. And the People , tho corrupt, are, in the main, best satisfy'd with this Conduct. \--- Speciosa Locis , morata que rect e Fabula, nullius veneris, sine pondere & arte, Valdi us oblectat populum, meliusque moratur, Qu am versus inopes rerum, nugaeque canorae. Hor. de Arte Poet. occasion of some new Work he has made publick, to tell him "that he has undoubtedly surpass'd Himself ." And indeed when one observes how well this Compliment is receiv'd; one wou'd imagine it to contain some wonderful Hyperbole of Praise. For according to the Strain of modern Politeness; 'tis not an ordinary Violation of Truth, which can afford a Tribute sufficient to answer any common degree of Merit. Now 'tis well known that the Gentlemen whose Merit lies towards Authorship , are unwilling to make the least Abatement on the foot of this Ceremonial. One wou'd wonder therefore to find 'em so intirely satisfy'd with a Form of Praise, which in plain sense amounts to no more than a bare Affirmative, "That they have in some manner differ'd from themselves, and are become somewhat worse or better , than their common rate." For if the vilest Writer grows viler than ordinary, or exceeds his natural pitch on either side, he is justly said to exceed , or go beyond himself. us'd in a way of Compliment to Great Men and Princes, than that plain one, which is so often verify'd, and may be safely pronounc'd for Truth, on most occasions; "That they have acted like themselves , and sutably to their own Genius and Character." The Compliment, it must be own'd, founds well. No one suspects it. For who is there that in his Imagination joins not something worthy and deserving with his true and native Self , as oft as he is refer'd to it, and made to consider, Who he is ? Such is the natural Affection of all Mankind towards moral Beauty and Perfection, that they never fail in making this Presumption in behalf of themselves: "That by Nature they have something estimable and worthy in respect of others of their Kind; and that their genuine, true , and natural Self , is, as it ought to be, of real value in Society, and justly honourable for the sake of its Merit, and good Qualitys." They conclude therefore they have the height of Praise allotted 'em, when they are assur'd by any one, that they have done nothing below themselves , or that in some particular Action, they have exceeded the ordinary Tenor of their Character. the Cult or Homage which is due to It. The Misfortune is, we are seldom taught to comprehend this Self , by placing it in a distinct View from its Representative or Counterfeit. In our holy Religion, which for the greatest part is adapted to the very meanest Capacitys, 'tis not to be expected that a Speculation of this kind shou'd be openly advanc'd. 'Tis enough that we have Hints given us of a nobler Self , than that which is commonly suppos'd to be the Basis and Foundation of our Actions. Self-Interest is there taken, as it is vulgarly conceiv'd. Tho on the other side there are, in the most  72 sacred Characters, Examples given us of the highest Contempt of all such interested Views, of a Willingness to suffer without recompence for the sake of others, and of a Desire to part even with Life and Being it-self, on account of what is generous and worthy. But in the same manner as the celestial Phenomena are in the Sacred Volumes generally treated according to common Imagination, and the then current System of Astronomy and natural Science; so the moral Appearances are in many places preserv'd without Alteration, according to vulgar Prejudice, and the general Conception of Interest and Self-Good. Our real and genuine Self is sometimes suppos'd that ambitious one which is fond of Power and Glory, sometimes that childish one which is taken with vain Shew, and is to be invited to Obedience by promise of finer Habitations, precious Stones and Metals, shining Garments, Crowns, and other such dazling Beautys, by which another Earth , or material City , is represented. disclos'd it-self in the chosen Nation; their natural  73 Gloominess appear'd still, by the great difficulty they had to know themselves , or learn their real Interest , after such long Tutorage and Instruction from above. The Simplicity of that People must certainly have been very great; when the best Doctrine cou'd not go down without a Treat , and the best Disciples had their Heads so running upon their Loaves , that they were apt to construe every Divine Saying in a  74 Belly -Sense, and thought nothing more self-constituent than that inferior Receptacle. Their Taste in Morals cou'd not but be sutable to this extraordinary Estimation of themselves. No wonder if the better and nobler Self was left as a Mystery to a People, who of all human kind were the most grosly selfish , crooked and perverse. So that it must necessarily be confess'd, in Honour of their Divine Legislators, Patriots, and Instructors; that they exceeded all others in Goodness and Generosity; since they cou'd so truly love their Nation and Brethren, such as they were; and cou'd have so generous and disinterested Regards for those who were in themselves so sordidly interested and undeserving. known Province of Philosophy to teach us our-selves , keep us the self- same Persons, and so regulate our governing Fancys, Passions, and Humours, as to make us comprehensible to our-selves, and knowable by other Features than those of a bare Countenance. For 'tis not certainly by virtue of our Face merely, that we are our-selves. 'Tis not WE who change, when our Complexion or Shape changes. But there is that which when it is wholly metamorphos'd and converted, WE are in reality transform'd and lost. run many ill Adventures while he travel'd thro the remotest parts of the East, and hottest Countrys of the South, return to us so alter'd in his whole outward Figure, that till we had for a time convers'd with him we cou'd not know him again to be the same Person; the matter wou'd not seem so very strange, nor wou'd our Concern on this account be very great. But shou'd a like Face and Figure of a Friend return to us with Thoughts and Humours of a strange and foreign Turn, with Passions, Affections, and Opinions wholly different from any thing we had formerly known; we shou'd say in earnest, and with the greatest Amazement and Concern, that this was another Creature , and not the Friend whom we once knew familiarly. Nor shou'd we in reality attempt any renewal of Acquaintance or Correspondence with such a Person, tho perhaps he might preserve in his Memory the saint Marks or Tokens of former Transactions which had pass'd between us. Character; when the Passion or Humour of a known Person changes remarkably from what it once was; 'tis to Philosophy we then appeal. 'Tis either the Want or Weakness of this Principle, which is charg'd on the Delinquent. And on this bottom it is, that we often challenge ourselves, when we find such variation in our Manners; and observe that it is not always the same Self , nor the same Interest we have in view; but often a direct contrary one, which we serve still with the same Passion and Ardour. When from a noted Liberality we change perhaps to as remarkable a Parsimony; when from Indolence and Love of Rest we plunge into Business; or from a busy and severe Character, abhorrent from the tender Converse of the Fair Sex, we turn on a sudden to a contrary Passion, and become amorous, or uxorious: we acknowledg the Weakness; and charging our Defect on the general want of Philosophy , we say (sighing) "That, indeed, we none of us truly know our-selves. " And thus we recognize the Authority and proper Object of Philosophy; so far at least, that tho we pretend not to be compleat Philosophers , yet as we have more or less of this Intelligence or Comprehension of our-selves, we accordingly confess we are more or less truly Men , and more or less to be depended on, in Friendship, Society, and the Commerce of Life. trial, are found to be as well relish'd, and of as good Savour with Mankind. But when invited to the Speculation, we turn our Eyes on that which we suppose the Tree , 'tis no wonder if we slight the Gardenership , and think the manner of Culture a very contemptible Mystery. " Grapes , 'tis said, are not gather'd from Thorns; nor Figs from Thistles. " Now if in the literate World there be any choking Weed, any thing purely Thorn or Thistle , 'tis in all likelihood that very kind of Plant which stands for  75 Philosophy in some famous Schools. There can be nothing more ridiculous than to expect that Manners or Understanding shou'd sprout from such a Stock. It pretends indeed some relation to Manners , as being definitive of the Natures, Essences, and Propertys of Spirits; and some relation to Reason , as describing the Shapes and Forms of certain Instruments imploy'd in the reasoning Art. But had the craftiest of Men, for many Ages together, been imploy'd in finding out a method to confound Reason , and degrade the Understanding of Mankind; they cou'd not perhaps have succeeded better, than by the Establishment of such a Mock- Science. high Spiritual Adventure in a Country where prophetick Missions are treated as no Jest, was, as he told me, committed a close Prisoner, and kept for several months where he saw no manner of Light. In this Banishment from Letters and Discourse, the Man very wittily invented an Amusement much to his purpose, and highly preservative both of Health and Humour. It may be thought perhaps, that of all Seasons or Circumstances here was one the most sutable to our oft mention'd practice of Soliloquy ; especially since the Prisoner was one of those whom in this Age we usually call Philosophers , a Successor of Science, or any thing relating to Self-Converse , he was a mere Novice. To work therefore he went after a different Method. He tun'd his natural Pipes not after the manner of a Musician, to practise what was melodious and agreeable in Sounds, but to fashion and form all sort of articulate Voices the most distinctly that was possible. This he perform'd by strenuously exalting his Voice, and essaying it in all the several Dispositions and Configurations of his Throat and Mouth. And thus bellowing, roaring, snarling, and otherwise variously exerting his Organs of Sound, he endeavour'd to discover what Letters of the Alphabet cou'd best design each Species, or what new Letters were to be invented, to mark the undiscover'd Modifications. He found, for instance, the Letter A to be a most genuine Character, an original and pure Vowel, and justly plac'd as principal in the front of the Alphabetick Order. For having duly extended his under Jaw, to its utmost distance from the upper; and by a proper Insertion of his Fingers provided against the Contraction of either Corner of his Mouth, he experimentally discover'd it impossible for human Tongue under these Circumstances to emit any other Modification of Sound than that which was describ'd by this primitive Character. The Vowel O was form'd by an orbicular Disposition of the Mouth; as was aptly delineated in the Character it-self. The Vowel U by a parallel Protrusion of the Lips. The other Vowels and Consonants by other various Collisions of the Mouth, and Operations of the active Tongue upon the passive Gum or Palate. The Result of this profound Speculation and long Exercise of our Prisoner, was a Philosophical Treatise , which he compos'd when he was set at liberty. He esteem'd himself the only Master of Voice and Language on the account of this his radical Science, and fundamental Knowledg of Sounds. But whoever had taken him to improve their Voice, or teach 'em an agreeable or just manner of Accent or Delivery, wou'd, I believe, have found themselves considerably deluded. Articulation. It has its place, no doubt, among the other Sciences, and may serve to Grammar , as Grammar serves to Rhetorick and to other Arts of Speech and Writing. The Solidity of Mathematicks , and its Advantage to Mankind, is prov'd by many effects in those beneficial Arts and Sciences which depend on it: tho Astrologers, Horoscopers , and other such, are pleas'd to honour themselves with the Title of Mathematicians. As for Metaphysicks , and that which in the Schools is taught for Logick or for Ethicks , I shall willingly allow it to pass for Philosophy , when by any real effects it is prov'd capable to refine our Spirits, improve our Understandings, or mend our Manners. But if the defining material and immaterial Substances , and distinguishing their Propertys and Modes , is recommended to us, as the right manner of proceeding in the Discovery of our own Natures, I shall be apt to suspect such a Study as the more delusive and insatuating, on account of its magnificent Pretension. Minds. Nor does the Student in the mean while suppose himself advancing in Wisdom, or the Knowledg of Himself or Mankind. All he desires, is to keep his Head sound, as it was before. And well, he thinks indeed, he has come off, if by good fortune there be no Crack made in it. As for other Ability or Improvement in the Knowledg of human Nature or the World; he refers himself to other Studys and Practice. Such is the Mathematician 's Modesty and good Sense. But for the Philosopher , who pretends to be wholly taken up in considering his higher Facultys, and examining the Powers and Principles of his Understanding, if in reality his Philosophy be foreign to the Matter profess'd; if it goes beside the mark, and reaches nothing that we can truly call our Interest or Concern; it must be somewhat worse than mere Ignorance or Idiotism. The most ingenious way of becoming foolish, is by a System. And the surest Method to prevent good Sense, is to set up something in the room of it. The liker any thing is to Wisdom, if it be not plainly the thing it-self , the more directly it becomes its opposite. Substances , that being so exalted in their Understandings, and inrich'd with Science above other Men, they shou'd be as much above 'em in their Passions and Sentiments. The Consciousness of being admitted into the secret Recesses of Nature and the inward Resources of a human Heart, shou'd, one wou'd think, create in these Gentlemen a sort of Magnanimity, which might distinguish 'em from the ordinary Race of Mortals. But if their pretended Knowledg of the Machine of this World , and of their own Frame , is able to produce nothing beneficial either to the one or to the other; I know not to what purpose such a Philosophy can serve, except only to shut the door against better Knowledg, and introduce Impertinence and Conceit with the best Countenance of Authority. has dealt in Ideas , and treated formally of the Passions , in a way of natural Philosophy , not to imagine himself more wise on this account, and more knowing in his own Character, and the Genius of Mankind. But that he is mistaken in his Calculation, Experience generally convinces us: none being found more impotent in themselves, of less command over their Passions, less free from Superstition and vain Fears, or less safe from common Imposture and Delusion, than the noted Head-pieces of this stamp. Nor is this Wonder. The Speculation in a manner bespeaks the Practice. There needs no formal Deduction to make this evident. A small Help from our familiar Method of Soliloquy may serve turn: and we may perhaps decide this matter in a more diverting way; by confronting this super-speculative Philosophy with a more practical sort, which relates chiefly to our Acquaintance, Friendship, and good Correspondence with our-selves. him for a while, I apply chiefly to my-self ; and, as occasion offers, assume that self-conversant Practice , which I have pretended to disclose. 'Tis hop'd therefore, he will not esteem it as ill Breeding, if I lose the usual regard to his Presence. And shou'd I fall insensibly into one of the Paroxysms describ'd; and as in a sort of Phrenzy, enter into high Expostulation with my-self; he will not surely be offended with the free Language, or even with the Reproaches he hears from a Person who only makes bold with whom he may. thinking to inform himself concerning Watches , shou'd inquire, of what Metal, or what Matter, each part was compos'd; what gave the Colours, or what made the Sounds; without examining what the real Use was of such an Instrument; or by what Movements its End was best attain'd, and its Perfection acquir'd: 'tis plain that such an Examiner as this, wou'd come short of any Understanding in the real Nature of the Instrument. Shou'd a Philosopher, after the same manner, employing himself in the Study of human Nature, discover only, what Effects each Passion wrought upon the Body; what change of Aspect or Feature they produc'd; and in what different manner they affected the Limbs and Muscles; this might possibly qualify him to give Advice to an Anatomist or a Limner, but not to Mankind or to Himself : Since according to this Survey he consider'd not the real Operation or Energy of his Subject, nor contemplated the Man , as real Man , and as a human Agent; but as a Watch or common Machine. " The Passion of Fear (as a  76 modern Philosopher informs me) determines the Spirits to the Muscles of the Knees, which are instantly ready to perform their Motion; by taking up the Legs with incomparable Celerity, in order to remove the Body out of harms way." ---Excellent Mechanism! But whether the knocking together of the Knees be any more the cowardly Symptom of Flight, than the chattering of the Teeth is the stout Symptom of Resistance, I shall not take upon me to determine. I shall find nothing here which is of the least Self \- Concernment. And I may depend upon it, that by the most refin'd Speculation of this kind, I shall neither learn to diminish my Fears, or raise my Courage. This, however, I may be assur'd of, that 'tis the Nature of Fear, as well as of other Passions, to have its increase and decrease, as it is fed by Opinion , and influenc'd by Custom and Practice. proportion with one another, affect my Character, and make me different with respect to my-self and others. I must, therefore, of necessity find Redress and Improvement in this case, by reflecting justly on the manner of my own Motion , as guided by Affections which depend so much on Apprehension and Conceit. By examining the various Turns, Inflexions, Declensions, and inward Revolutions of the Passions , I must undoubtedly come the better to understand a human Breast, and judg the better both of others and my-self . 'Tis impossible to make the least advancement in such a Study, without acquiring some Advantage, from the Regulation and Government of those Passions, on which the Conduct of a Life depends. oppresses; 'tis not very material to inquire, on this occasion, to what Parts or Districts the Blood or Spirits are immediately detach'd, or where they are made to rendevouz. For this no more imports me to understand, than it depends on me to regulate or change. But when the Grounds of this superstitious Fear are consider'd to be from Opinion , and the Subjects of it come to be thorowly search'd and examin'd; 'tis impossible but the Passion it-self must diminish, as I discover more and more the Imposture which belongs to it. Vanity is conceiv'd, from what imaginary Advantages, and inconsiderable Grounds; if I view it in its excessive height, as well as in its contrary depression; 'tis impossible but I must in some measure be reliev'd of this Distemper.

Epist. 1. lib. 1. the other Passions from whence I frame the different Notion I have of Interest. For according as these Passions veer, my Interest veers, my Steerage varies; and I make alternately, now this, now that, to be my Course and Harbour. The Man in Anger, has a different Happiness from the Man in Love. And the Man lately become covetous, has a different Notion of Satisfaction from what he had before, when he was liberal. Even the Man in Humour, has another Thought of Interest and Advantage than the Man out of Humour, or in the least disturb'd. The Examination, therefore, of my Humours , and the  77 Search and Scrutiny of my Opinions , and the sincere Consideration of my Scope and End. And thus the Study of Human Affection cannot but lead me towards the Knowledg of Human Nature , and of My-Self. all other Science, or Knowledg. Nor can this surely be of the sort call'd  78 vain or deceitful ; since it is the only means by which I can discover Vanity and Deceit. This is not of that kind which depends on  79 Genealogys or Traditions , and  80 ministers Questions and vain Jangling. It has not its Name, as other Philosophys, from the mere Subtlety and Nicety of the Speculation; but, by way of Excellence, from its being superior to all other Speculations; from its presiding over all other Sciences and Occupations; teaching the Measure of each, and assigning the just Value of every thing in Life. By this Science Religion itself is judg'd, Spirits are search'd, Prophecys prov'd, Miracles distinguish'd: the sole Measure and Standard being taken from moral Rectitude , and from the Discernment of what is sound and just in the Affections. For if the  81 Tree is known only by its Fruits ; my first Endeavour must be to distinguish the true Taste of Fruits , refine my Palat, and establish a just Relish in the kind. So that to bid me judge Authority by Morals, whilst the Rule of Morals is suppos'd dependent on mere Authority and Will ; is the same in reality as to bid me see with my Eyes shut, measure without a Standard, and count without Arithmetick. besides; discovers her own Province, and chief Command; teaches me to distinguish between her Person, and her Likeness; and shows me her immediate and real self, by that sole Privilege of teaching me to know my-self , and what belongs to me. She gives to every inferiour Science its just rank; leaves some to measure Sounds; others to scan Syllables ; others to weigh Vacuums , and define Spaces , and Extensions ; but reserves to her-self her due Authority, and Majesty; keeps her State, and antient Title, of Vita Dux, Virtutis Indagatrix , and the rest of those just Appellations which of old belong'd to her; when she merited to be apostrophiz'd, as she was, by the  82 Orator: " Tu Inventrix Legum, Tu Magistra morum & disciplinae ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Est autem unus dies bene & ex praeceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati anteponendus.

Let me examine my Ideas of Space and Substance : Let me look well into Matter and its Modes ; if this be looking into my-self ; if this be to improve my Understanding , and enlarge my Mind. Let me observe, with diligence, what passes here ; what Connexion and Consistency, what Agreement or Disagreement I find within : Whether, according to my present Ideas , that which I approve this Hour, I am like to approve as well the next: And in case it be otherwise with me; how or after what manner, I shall relieve my- self; how ascertain my Ideas , and keep my Opinion, Liking, and Esteem of things, the same.

'Tis here surely they are to be maintain'd, if any where. 'Tis here I am to preserve some just Distinctions , and adequate Ideas ; which if I cannot do a jot the more, by what such a Philosophy can teach me, the Philosophy is in this respect imposing, and delusive. For whatever its other Virtues are; it relates not to Me my-self , it concerns not the Man , nor any otherwise affects the Mind than by the Conceit of Knowledg, and the Assurance rais'd from a suppos'd Improvement, which is in reality none at all. Life ? What Judgment am I to make of Mankind and human Affairs? What Sentiments am I to frame? What Opinions? What Maxims? If none at all; why do I concern my-self in Speculations about my Ideas ? What is it to me, for instance, to know what kind of Idea I can form of Space ? "Divide a solid Body of whatever Dimension (says a grave Philosopher:) And 'twill be impossible for the Parts to move within the bounds of its Superficies; if there be not left in it (says the Author) a void Space, as big as the least part into which the said Body is divided."--- Plenitudinarian , on the other side, brings his Fluid in play, and joins the Idea of Body and Extension. Of this, says one, I have clear Ideas. Of this, says the other, I can be certain. And what, say I, if in the whole matter there be no certainty at all?" For Mathematicians are divided: and Mechanicks proceed as well on one Hypothesis as on the other. My Mind , I am satisfy'd, will proceed either way alike: For it is concern'd on neither side.---Philosopher! Let me hear concerning what is of some moment to me. Let me hear concerning Life ; what the right Notion is; and what I am to stand to, upon occasion: that I may not, when Life seems retiring, or has run it-self out to the very Dregs, cry Vanity ! condemn the World, and at the same time complain, that Life is short and passing ! For why so short indeed; if not found sweet ? Why do I complain both ways? Is Vanity, mere Vanity , a Happiness? Or can Misery pass away too soon? other side, I cannot find the Agreement or Disagreement of my Ideas in this place; if I can come to nothing certain here; what is all the rest to me? What signifies it how I come by my Ideas , or how compound 'em; which are simple , and which complex ? If I have a right Idea of Life , now when perhaps I think slightly of it, and resolve with my-self, "That it may easily be laid "down on any honourable occasion of Service to my Friends, or Country; teach me how I may preserve this Idea : or, at least, how I may get safely rid of it; that it may trouble me no more, nor lead me into ill Adventures. Teach me how I came by such an Opinion of Worth and Virtue; what it is, that at one time raises it so high, and at another time reduces it to nothing; how these Distubances and Fluctuations happen; by what Innovation, what Composition, what Intervention of other Ideas. If this be the Subject of the Philosophical Art ; I readily apply to it, and embrace the Study. If there be nothing of this in the Case; I have no occasion for this sort of Learning; and am no more desirous of knowing how I form or compound those Ideas which are mark'd by Words, than I am of knowing how, and by what Motions of my Tongue or Palat, I form those articulate Sounds , which I can full as well pronounce, without any such Science or Speculation. my Reader; lest if he prove one of the uncourteous kind, he shou'd raise a considerable Objection in this place. He may ask perhaps, "Why a Writer for Self-Entertainment shou'd not keep his Writings to himself, without appearing in Publick , or before the World. " before the World , I do not readily conceive what our worthy Objector may understand by it. I have, indeed, among my Acquaintance, certain Merchant- Adventurers in the Letter-Trade, who in Correspondence with their Factor- Bookseller, are enter'd into a notable Commerce with the World. They have directly, and in due Form of Preface , and Epistle Dedicatory , sollicited the Publick , and made Interest with Friends, for Favour and Protection on this account. They have ventur'd, perhaps, to join some Great Man's Reputation with their own; having obtain'd his Permission to address a Work to him, on presumption of its passing for something considerable in the eyes of Mankind. One may easily imagine that such patroniz'd and avow'd Authors as these, wou'd be shrewdly disappointed if the Publick took no notice of their Labours. But for my own part, 'tis of no concern to me, what regard the Publick bestows on my Amusements; or after what manner it comes acquainted with what I write for my private Entertainment, or by way of Advice to such of my Acquaintance as are thus desperately embark'd. 'em in better Characters than those of my own Hand-writing. And by good luck I have a very fair Hand offer'd, which may save me the trouble of re-copying, and can readily furnish me with as many handsom Copys as I wou'd desire, for my own and Friends Service. I have not, indeed, forbid my Amanuensis the making as many as he pleases for his own Benefit. What I write is not worth being made a Mystery. And if it be worth any one's purchasing; much good may do the Purchaser. 'Tis a Traffick I have no share in; tho I accidentally furnish the Subject-matter. conscious to my-self of no additional Virtue, or dangerous Quality, from having lain at any time under the weight of that alphabetick Engine call'd the Press. I know no Conjuration in it, either with respect to Church, or State. Nor can I imagine why the Machine shou'd appear so formidable to Scholars, and renown'd Clerks; whose very Mystery and Foundation depends on the Letter-Manufacture. To allow Benefit of Clergy , and to restrain the Press , seems to me to have something of Cross-purpose in it. I can hardly think that the Quality of what is written can be alter'd by the Manner of Writing: or that there can be any harm in a quick way of copying fair, and keeping Copys alike. Why a Man may not be permitted to write with Iron as well as Quill , I can't conceive; or how a Writer changes his Capacity, by this new Dress, any more than by the wear of Wove -Stockins, after having worn no other Manufacture than the Knit. two above-mention'd. For being engag'd in Morals , and induc'd to treat so rigorous a Subject as that of Self-Examination ; I naturally call to mind the extreme Delicacy and Tenderness of modern Appetites, in respect of the Philosophy of this kind. What Distaste possibly may have arisen from some medicinal Doses of a like nature, administer'd to raw Stomachs, at a very early Age, I will not pretend to examine. But whatever Manner in Philosophy happens to bear the least resemblance to that of Catechism , cannot, I'm persuaded, of it-self, prove very inviting. Such a smart way of questioning our-selves in our Youth, has made our Manhood more averse to the expostulatory Discipline. And tho the metaphysical Points of our Belief are by this method, with admirable Care and Caution, instill'd into tender Minds; yet the manner of thus anticipating Philosophy, may make the afterwork of Reason, and the inward Exercise of the Mind, at a riper Age, proceed the more heavily, and with greater reluctance. Childhood; and been instructed in our own and other higher Natures, Essences, incorporeal Substances, Personalitys , and the like; to condescend at riper Years to ruminate and con over this Lesson a second time. 'Tis hard, after having, by so many pertinent Interrogatorys, and decisive Sentences, declar'd Who and What we are; to come leisurely, in another View, to inquire concerning our real Self , and End , the Judgment we are to make of prove the leading Principle of our Lives. Schooling , after having once learnt our Lesson from the World ? Hardly, I presume. For by the Lesson of this latter School , and according to the Sense I acquire in Converse with prime Men ; shou'd I at any time ask my-self, What govern'd me ? I shou'd answer readily, My Interest. "But what is Interest ? And how govern'd? By Opinion and Fancy. Is every thing therefore my Interest which I fancy such? Or may my Fancy possibly be wrong? It may. If my Fancy of Interest therefore be wrong; can my Pursuit or, Aim be right? Hardly so. Can I then be suppos'd to hit , when I know not, in reality, so much as how to aim ?" certainly where my Happiness and Advantage lies. "Where can it lie but with my Pleasure ; since my Advantage and Good can never but be pleasing : and what is pleasing , can never be other than my Advantage and Good? Excellent! Let Fancy therefore govern, and Interest be what we please. For if that which pleases us be our Good, because it pleases us ; Any-thing may be our our Happiness at one time, we may as readily un-make again at another. No one can learn what real Good is. Nor can any one upon this foot be said to understand his Interest ." candidly with our-selves, and frankly own that Pleasure is no rule of change from one sort to another: condemning that at one time which at another we earnestly approve; and never judging equally of Happiness , whilst we follow Passion and mere Humour. A Lover , for instance, when struck with the Idea or Fancy of his Enjoyment, promises himself the highest Felicity, if he succeeds in his new Amour. \---H e succeeds in it; finds not the Felicity he expected: but promises himself the same again in some other. \---The same thing happens: H e is disappointed as before; but still has Faith. \---Weary'd with this Game, he quits the Chace; renounces the way of Courtship and Intrigue , and detests the Ceremony and Difficulty of the Pleasure. ---A new Species of Amours invites him. Here too he meets the same Inquietude and Inconstancy.--- Scorning to grow sottish , and plunge in the lowest Sink of Vice, he shakes off his Intemperance; despises Gluttony and Riot ; and hearkens to Ambition. He grows a Man of Business, and seeks Authority and Fame.--- Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo ? Hor. Epist. 1. Lib. 1. controul my Fancy , and fix it, if possible, on something which may hold good. \---When I exercise my Reason in moral Subjects; when I employ my Affection in friendly and social Actions, I find I can at that time sincerely enjoy my-self. If there be a Pleasure therefore of this kind; why not indulge it? Or what harm wou'd there be, supposing it shou'd grow greater by Indulgence? If I am lazy , and indulge my-self in the languid Pleasure; I know the harm, and can foresee the Drone. If I am luxurious, I know the harm of this also, and have the plain prospect of the Sot. If Avarice be my Pleasure; the End, I know, is being a Miser. But if Honesty be my Delight, I know no other consequence from indulging such a Passion, than that of growing better natur'd , and enjoying more and more the Pleasures of Society. On the other hand, if this honest Pleasure be lost, by knavish Indulgence, and Immorality, there can hardly be a Satisfaction left of any kind; since good Nature and  83 social Affection is so essential even to the Pleasures of a Debauch. be that of the honest and moral kind; if the rational and social Enjoyment be so constant in it-self, and so essential to Happiness; why shou'd I not bring my other Pleasures to correspond and be Friends with it, rather than raise my-self other Pleasures, which are destructive of this Foundation, and have no manner of Correspondency with one another? maintain my-self in my moral Fortress, against the Attacks which are rais'd on the side of corrupt Interest and a wrong Self. When the Idea of Pleasure strikes, I ask my-self: "Before I was thus struck by the Idea, was any thing amiss with me? No. Therefore remove the Idea, and I am well. But having this Idea such as I now have, I cannot want the Thing, without regret. See, therefore, which is best: either to suffer under this Want, till the Idea be remov'd; or by satisfying the Want, confirm not only this Idea, but all of the same stamp!" single one be admitted upon its own Authority? And what must be the Issue of such an Oeconomy, if the whole fantastick Crew be introduc'd, and the Door refus'd to none? What else is it but this Management which leads to the most dissolute and profligate of Characters? What is it, on the contrary, that raises us to any degree of Worth or Steddiness, but a direct contrary Practice and Conduct? Can there be Strength of Mind ; can there be Command over one's self ; if the Ideas of Pleasure, the Suggestions of Fancy , and the strong Pleadings of Appetite and Desire are not often withstood, and the Imaginations soundly reprimanded, and brought under Subjection? Practice. Nor is there any thing un-galante in the manner of thus questioning the Lady-Fancys , which present themselves as charmingly dress'd as possible to sollicit their Cause, and obtain a Judgment, by favour of that worse Part , and corrupt Self , to whom they make their Application. Solicitresses. They never seem to importune us; tho they are ever in our Eye, and meet us whichever way we turn. They understand better how to manage their Appearance, than by always throwing up their Veil, and shewing their Faces openly in a broad Light, to run the danger of cloying our Sight, or exposing their Features to a strict Examination. So far are they from such Forwardness, that they often stand as at a distance; suffering us to make the first Advance, and contenting themselves with discovering a side-Face, or bestowing now and then a glance in a mysterious manner, as if they endeavour'd to conceal their Persons. dismal Weed, with the most mournful Countenance imaginable; often casting up her Eyes, and wringing her Hands; so that 'tis impossible not to be mov'd by her, till her Meaning be consider'd, and her Imposture fully known. The Airs she borrows, are from the Tragick Muse Melpomene. Nor is she in her own Person any way amiable or attractive. Far from it. Her Art is to render her- self as forbidding as possible; that her Sisters may by her means be the more alluring. And if by her tragick Aspect, and melancholy Looks, she can persuade us that Death (whom she represents) is such a hideous Form; she conquers in behalf of the whole fantastick Tribe of wanton, gay, and fond Desires. Effeminacy and Cowardice instantly prevail. The poorest Means of Life grow in Repute, when the Ends and just Conditions of it are so little known, and the Dread of parting with it rais'd to so high a degree. The more eagerly we grasp at Life , the more impotent we are in the Enjoyment of it. By this Avidity, its very Lees and Dregs are swallow'd. The Ideas of sordid Pleasure are advanc'd. Worth, Manhood, Generosity, and all the nobler Opinions and Sentiments of honest Good , and virtuous Pleasure, disappear, and fly before this Queen of Terrours. seconding this Phantom , and playing her upon our Understandings, whenever they wou'd take occasion to confound 'em. The vicious Poets employ this Specter too on their side; tho after a different manner. By the help of this tragick Actrice, they gain a fairer Audience for the luxurious Fancys, and give their Eratos and other playsome Muses a fuller Scope in the support of Riot and Debauch. The gloomy Prospect of Death becomes the Incentive to Pleasures of the lowest Order. Ashes and Shade , the Tomb and Cypress , are made to serve as Foils to Luxury. The Abhorrence of an insensible State makes mere Vitality and Animal-Sensation highly cherish'd. Indulge Genio: carpamus dulcia, nostrum est Quod vivis: Cinis, & Manes, & Fabula fies. Pers. Sat. 5. 'Tis no wonder if Luxury profits by the Deformity of this Specter-Opinion. She supports her Interest by this childish Bugbear; and, as the Mother by her Infant, is hugg'd so much the closer as the Fear presses. She invites us to live fast , according to her best measure of Life. And well she may. Who wou'd not willingly make Life to pass as quickly as was possible; when the nobler Pleasures of it were already lost or corrupted by a wretched Fear of Death ? The intense Selfishness and Meanness which accompanies this Fear, must reduce us to a low ebb of Enjoyment, and in a manner bring to nothing that main Sum of satisfactory Sensations, by which we vulgarly rate the Happiness of our private State and Fortune. Muse , the beauteous Calliope ! She shews us what real Beauty is, and what those Numbers are, which make Life perfect, and bestow the chief Enjoyment. She sets Virtue before our Eyes, and teaches us how to rate Life , from the Experience of the most heroick Spirits. She brings her Sisters Clio and Urania to support her. From the former she borrows whatever is memorable in History, and antient Time, to confront the tragick Specter, and shew the fix'd Contempt which the happiest and freest Nations, as well as single Heroes, and private Men worthy of any Note, have ever express'd for that Impostress. From the latter she borrows what is sublimest in Philosophy, to explain the Laws of Nature, the Order of the Universe, and represent to us the Justice of accompanying this amiable Administration. She shews us that by this just Compliance we are made happiest: and that the measure of a happy Life is not from the fewer or more Suns which we behold, the fewer or more Breaths we draw, or Meals which we repeat; but from the having once liv'd well , acted our Part handsomly, and made our Exit chearfully, and as became us. is august among those Sisters, appears readily in our behalf. Nor are the more jocund Ladys wanting in their Assistance, when they act in the Perfection of their Art, and inspire some better Genius's in this kind of Poetry. Such were the nobler Lyricks , and those of the latter , and more refin'd Comedy of the Antients. The Thalia's , the Polymnia's , the Terpsycore's , the Cause of Numbers , are with regret employ'd another way, in favour of Disorder. Instead of being made Syrens to serve the Purposes of Vice, they wou'd with more delight accompany their elder Sisters, and add their Graces and attractive Charms to what is most Harmonious, Muse-like, and Divine in human Life. There is this difference only between these and the more heroick Dames; that they can more easily be perverted, and take the vicious Form. For who but some Monster, rather than Master, in the Poetick Art, cou'd bring the Epick or Tragick Muse to act the Pandar, or be subservient to Effeminacy and Cowardice? 'Tis not against Death, Hazards or Toils, that Tragedy and the heroick Fable are pointed. 'Tis not mere Life which is here exalted, or has its Price enhanc'd. On the contrary, its Calamitys are expos'd: the Disorders of the Passions set to view: Fortitude recommended: Honour advanc'd: the Contempt of Death plac'd as the peculiar Note of every generous and happy Soul; and the tenacious Love of Life, as the truest Character of an abject Wretch. Usque adeone mori miserum est ?------ and false Ideas of Happiness and Good; when this frightful Specter of Misery and Ill, is after this manner well lay'd, and by honest Magick conjur'd down; so as not to give the least assistance to the other tempting Forms. This is that occult Science, or sort of Counter- Necromancy , which instead of Ghastliness and Horrour, inspires only what is gentle and humane, and dispels the imposing Phantoms of every kind. He may pass undoubtedly, for no mean Conjurer , who can deal with Spirits of this sort---But hold!---Let us try the Experiment in due form, and draw the magick Circle. Let us observe how the inferiour Imps appear; when the Head- Goblin is securely laid--- of Ease and lazy Luxury. She promises the sweetest Life, and invites us to her Pillow: injoins us to expose our-selves to no adventurous Attempt; and forbids us any Engagement which may bring us into Action. "Where, then, are the Pleasures which Ambition promises, and Love affords? How is the gay World enjoy'd? Or are those to be esteem'd no Pleasures , which are lost by Dullness and Inaction? But Indolence is the highest Pleasure. To live, and not to feel! To feel no Trouble. What Good then? Life it-self. And is this properly to live? Is sleeping, Life ? Is this what I shou'd study to prolong? ---" Here the fantastick Tribe it-self seems scandaliz'd. A Civil War begins. The major part of the capricious Dames range themselves on Reason's side, and declare against the languid Syren. Ambition blushes at the offer'd Sweet. Conceit and Vanity take superiour Airs. Even Luxury her-self, in her polite and elegant Humour, reproves the Apostate-Sister, and marks her as an Alien to true Pleasure---"Away, thou drowsy Phantom ! Haunt me no more. For I have learn'd from better than thy Sisterhood, that Life and Happiness consist in Action and Employment. ". despising Pains and Labour. She wears the serious Countenance of Virtue, but with Features of Anxiety and Disquiet. What is it she mutters? What looks she on, with such Admiration and Astonishment? \---Bags! Coffers! Heaps of shining Metal! "What! for the Service of Luxury ? For her these Preparations? Art thou then her Friend (grave Fancy!) is it for her thou toil'st? No, but for Provision against Want. But, Luxury apart! tell me now, hast thou not already a Competence? 'Tis good to be secure against the fear of Starving. Is there then no Death but this ? No other Passage out of Life? Are other Doors secur'd, if this be barr'd? Say, Avarice ! (thou emptiest of Phantoms) is it not vile Cowardice thou serv'st? What further have I then to do with thee (thou doubly vile Dependent!) when once I have dismiss'd thy Patroness, and despis'd her Threats?" Appetites and Desires are fabricated. Hence they derive their Privilege and Currency. If I can stop the Mischief here, and prevent false Coinage; I am safe. " Idea ! wait a while till I have examin'd thee, whence thou art, and to whom thou retain'st. Art thou of Ambition's Train? Or dost thou promise only Pleasure ? Say! what am I to sacrifice for thy sake? What Honour? What Truth? What Manhood?---What Bribe is it thou bring'st along with thee? Describe the flattering Object; but without Flattery; plain, as the thing is; without addition, without sparing or reserve. Is it Wealth ? is it a Report ? a Title ? or a Female ? Come not in a Troop, (ye Fancys!) Bring not your Objects crouding, to confound the Sight. But let me examine your Worth and Weight distinctly. Think not to raise accumulative Happiness. For if separately, you contribute nothing; in conjunction, you can only amuse." WHILST I am thus penning a Soliloquy in form, I can't forbear reflecting on my Work. And when I view the manner of it with a familiar Eye; I am readier, I find, to make my-self Diversion on this occasion, than to suppose my-self in good earnest about a Work of consequence. "What! Am I to be thus fantastical? Must I busy my-self with Phantoms? fight with Apparitions and Chimeras? For certain: Or the Chimeras will be before-hand with me, and busy themselves so as to get the better of my Understanding. What! talk to my-self like some Madman , in different Persons and under different Characters! Undoubtedly: or 'twill be soon seen who is a real Madman , and changes Character in earnest, without knowing how to help it." long as we have Appetites and Sense , the Fancys of all kinds will be hard at work; and whether we are in company, or alone, they must range still, and be active. They must have their Field. The Question is, Whether they shall have it wholly to themselves; or whether they shall have some Controuler or Manager. If none; 'Tis this, I fear, that leads to Madness. 'Tis this, and nothing else, that can be call'd Madness or Loss of Reason. For if right, if any thing be so, because I fancy it. "The House turns round. The Prospect turns. No, but my Head turns indeed: I have a Giddiness: that's all. Fancy wou'd persuade me thus and thus: but I know better." 'Tis by means therefore of a Controuler and Corrector of Fancy, that I am sav'd from being mad. Otherwise, 'tis the House turns , when I am giddy. 'Tis things that charge (for so I must suppose) when my Passion merely, or Temper changes. "But I was out of Order. I dreamt. Who tells me this? Who but the Correctrice , by whose means I am in my Wits, and without whom I am no longer my-self ?" hold his Fancys under some kind of Discipline and Management. The stricter this Discipline is, the more the Man is rational and in his Wits. The looser it is, the more fantastical he must be, and the nearer to the Madman's State. This is a Business which can never stand still. I must always be Winner or Loser at the Game. Either I work upon my Fancys , or They on Me. If I give Quarter, They won't. There can be no Truce, no Suspension of Arms between us. The one or the other must be superiour, and have the Command. For if the Fancys are left to themselves, the Government must, of course, be theirs. And then, what difference between such a State and Madness? , when 'tis ask'd, " Who rules ? or Who is Master ?" Learn by the Voices. Observe who speaks aloud in a commanding Tone: Who talks, who questions; or who is talk'd with, and who question'd. For if the Servants take the former part; they are the Masters, and the Government of the House will be found such as naturally may be expected in these Circumstances. Command? How stand my Fancys ? How deal they with me? Or do I take upon me rather to deal with Them ? Do I talk, question, arraign? Or am I talk'd with, arraign'd, and contented to hear, without giving a Reply? If I vote with 85 Misery as she judges; how am I my-self ? over his Head; fears bursting Clouds in a clear Sky, cries Fire! Deluge! Earth-quake or Thunder ! when all is quiet: does he not rave? But one whose Eyes seemingly strike fire, by a Blow; one whose Head is giddy from the Motion of a Ship, after having been newly set ashore; or one who from a Distemper in his Ear hears thundring Noises; can readily redress these several Apprehensions, and is by this means sav'd from Madness. when Cataracts and other Impuritys are gathering in that Organ; Flys, Insects, and other various Forms, seem playing in the Air before me. But let my Senses err ever so widely; I am not on this account beside my-self : Nor am I out of my own Possession, whilst there is a Person left within; who has Power to dispute the Appearances, and redress the Imagination. on their Report. I hear their Story, and return 'em Answer, as they deserve. on the contrary, I have no Debate with her, no Controversy, but take for Happiness and Misery , for Good and Ill , whatever she presents as such; I must then join Voices with her, and cry Precipice! Fire ! " Sandy Desarts! flowery Fields! Seas of Milk, and Ships of Amber !" deeply struck with the Fancy of conquering Worlds, was ingeniously shewn the Method of expostulating with his Lady- Governess ; when by a discreet Friend, and at an easy Hour, he was ask'd little by little concerning his Design, and the final Purpose , and promis'd Good which the flattering Dame propos'd to him. The Story is sufficiently noted. All the Artifice employ'd against the Prince was a well-manag'd Interrogatory of what next ? Lady- Fancy was not aware of the Design upon her; but let her-self be worm'd out, by degrees. At first, she said the Prince's design was only upon a Tract of Land, which stood out like a Promontory before him, and seem'd to eclipse his Glory. A fair rich Island, which was close by, presented it-self next, and as it were naturally invited Conquest. The opposite Coast came next in view. Then the Continent on each side the larger Sea. And then (what was easiest of all, and wou'd follow of course) the Dominion both of Sea and Land. "And What next ? reply'd the Friend. What shall we do, when we are become thus happy, and have obtain'd our highest Wish? Why then, we'll sit down peaceably, and be good Company over a Bottle. Alas, Sir! What hinders us from doing the same, where we now are? Will our Humour, or our Wine grow better? Shall we be more secure, or at Heart's Ease? What you may possibly lose by these Attempts, is easy to conceive. But which way you will be a Gainer, your own Fancy (you see) cannot so much as suggest." Fancy in the mean while carry'd her point: For she was absolute over the Monarch; and had been too little talk'd to by her-self , to bear being reprov'd in Company. The Prince grew sullen; turn'd the Discourse; abhor'd the Profanation offer'd to his Sovereign-Empress; deliver'd up his Thoughts to her again with deep Devotion, and fell to conquering with all his Might. The Sound of Victory rung in his Ears. Laurels and Crowns play'd before his Eyes. What was this but Giddiness and Dream? Appearances uncorrected? Worlds dancing? Phantoms playing? Seas of Milk! and Ships of Amber! ordinary Circumstances of Life, how Love, Ambition , and the gayer Tribe of Fancys (as well as the gloomy and dark Specters of another sort) prevail over our Mind, 'Tis easy to observe how they work on us, when we refuse to be before-hand with 'em, and bestow repeated Lessons on the encroaching Sorceresses. On this it is, that our offer'd Advice , and Method of depends. And whether this be of any use towards making us either wiser, or happier; I am confident, it must help to make us wittier and politer. It must, beyond any other Science, teach us the Turns of Humour and Passion , the Variety of Manners , the Justness of Characters , and Truth of Things; which when we rightly understand, we may naturally describe. And on this depends chiefly the Skill and Art of a good Writer. So that if to write well be a just pretence to Merit; 'is plain, that Writers , who are apt to set no small Value on their Art, must confess there is something valuable in this self-examining Practice, and Method of inward Colloquy. modestly to stile themselves) he is contented, for his part, to take up with this Practice, barely for his own proper Benefit; without regard to the high Function or Capacity of Author. It may be allow'd him, in this particular, to imitate the best Genius and most Gentleman-like of Roman Poets. And tho by an Excess of Dullness, it shou'd be his misfortune to learn nothing of his Wit , he is persuaded he may something of his Honestly and good Humour. \--- Neque \--- Neque enim, cum lectulus, aut Me Porticus excepit, desum Mihi : " Rectius hoc est: Hoc faciens, vivam melius: sic dulcis Amicis Occuram."---H aec Ego Mecum Compressis agito labris. \--- Hor. Sat. 4. lib. 1. 86 cast our Eye back, on what has already pass'd. The Observers of Method generally make this the Place of Recapitulation. Other Artists have substituted the Practice of Apology , or Extenuation. For the anticipating Manner of prefatory Discourse, is too well known, to work any surprizing effect in the Author's behalf: Preface being become only another word to signify Excuse. Besides that the Author is generally the most straiten'd in that preliminary Part, which on other accounts is but too apt to grow voluminous. He therefore takes the advantage of his Corollary or Winding up ; and ends pathetically, by endeavouring, in the softest manner, to reconcile his Reader to those Faults which he chuses rather to excuse than to amend. pass'd over by any Writer. 'Tis the chief Stratagem by which he engages in personal Conference with his Reader; and can talk immoderately of Himself , with all the seeming Modesty of one who is the furthest from any selfish Views, or conceited Thoughts of his own Merit. There appears such a peculiar Grace and Ingenuity in the method of confessing Laziness, Precipitancy, Carelesness , or whatever other Vices have been the occasion of the Author's Deficiency; that it wou'd seem a Pity, had the Work it-self been brought to such Perfection as to have left no room for the penitent Party to enlarge on his Demerits. For from the multiplicity of these, he finds Subject to ingratiate himself with his Reader ; who doubtless is not a little rais'd by this Submission of a confessing Author ; and is ready, on these terms, to give him Absolution , and receive him into his good Grace and Favour. prevails. They who hope to rise by Merit , are likeliest to be disappointed in their Pretensions. The confessing Lover, who ascribes all to the Bounty of the Fair-one, meets his Reward the sooner, for having study'd less how to deserve it. For Merit is generally thought presumptuous, and suppos'd to carry with it a certain Assurance and Ease, with which a Mistress is not so well contented. The Claim of well-deserving seems to derogate from the pure Grace and Favour of the Benefactrice ; who then appears to her-self most sovereign in Power, and likeliest to be obey'd without reserve, when she bestows her Bounty, where there is least Title, or Pretension. least Charge of Profaneness, or Idolatry, may, according to vulgar Imagination, serve to justify these galante Votarys , in the imitation of the real  87 Religious and Devout. The method of Abasement may be thought the properest to make Approaches to these Shrines: And the intire Resignation of Merit may, in these Cases, be esteem'd the only ground of well-deserving. But what we allow to Heaven , or to the Fair , shou'd not, methinks, be made a Precedent, in favour of the World. Whatever Deference is due to that Body of Men whom we call Readers ; we may be suppos'd to treat 'em with sufficient Honour; if with thorow Diligence, and Pains, we endeavour to render our Works perfect ; and leave 'em to judg of the Performance, as they are able. bring Perfection into his Work; if he has not at least the Idea of his Performance. Tho his Intention be to please the World, he must nevertheless be, in a manner, above it ; and fix his Eye upon that consummate Grace , that Beauty of Nature , and that Perfection of Numbers, which the rest of Mankind, feeling only by the Effect, whilst ignorant of the Cause, term the Fe-ne-scay-quoy , the unintelligible, or the I know not what; and suppose to be a kind of Charm , or Enchantment , of which the Artist himself can give no account. can I forbear making some Apology for my frequent Recourse to the Rules of common Artists, to the Masters of Exercises, to the Academys of Painters, Statuarys, and to the rest of the Virtuoso -Tribe. But in this I am so fully satisfy'd I have Reason on my side, that let Custom be ever so strong against me, I had rather repair to these inferiour Schools, to search for Truth , and Nature ; than to some other Places, where higher Arts and Sciences are profess'd. higher step towards the becoming a Man of Virtue and good Sense, than the being what in this Age we call  88 a Scholar. For even rude Nature it-self, in its primitive Simplicity, is a better Guide to Judgment, than improv'd Sophistry, and pedantick Learning. The Faciunt, n ae, intellegendo, ut nihil intellegant , will ever, ever be apply'd by Men of Discernment and free Thought to such Logick, such Principles, such Forms and Rudiments of Knowledg, as are establish'd in certain Schools of Literature and Science. The case is sufficiently understood even by those who are unwilling to confess the Truth of it. Effects betray their Causes. And the known Turn and Figure of those Understandings, which sprout from Nurserys of this kind, give a plain Idea of what is judg'd on this occasion. 'Tis no wonder, if after so wrong a ground of Education, there appears to be such need of Redress, and Amendment, from that excellent School which we call the World. The mere Amusements of Gentlemen are found more improving than the profound Researches of Pedants. And in the Management of our Youth, we are forc'd to have recourse to the former; as an Antidote against the Genius peculiar to the latter. If the Formalists of this sort were erected into Patentees, with a sole Commission of Authorship ; we shou'd undoubtedly see such Writing in our Days, as wou'd either wholly wean us from all Books in general, or at least from all such as were the product of our own Nation, under such a subordinate and conforming Government. Men and Manners, where it is not necessary for the Author  89 to understand Poetical and Moral Truth , the Beauty of Sentiments, the Sublime of Characters; and carry in his Eye the Model or Exemplar of that natural Grace , which gives to every Action its attractive Charm. If he has naturally no Eye, or Ear, for these interiour Numbers ; 'tis not likely he shou'd be able to judg better of that exteriour Proportion and Symmetry of Composition, which constitutes a legitimate Piece. "That in the very nature of Things there must of necessity be the Foundation of a wrong and a right Taste , Relish , or Choice , as well in respect of inward Characters and Features, as of outward Person, Behaviour, and Action;" we shou'd be far more asham'd of Ignorance and wrong Judgment in the former, than in the latter of these Subjects. Even in the Arts, which are merely Imitations of that outward Grace and Beauty, we not only confess a Taste ; but make it a part of refin'd Breeding, to discover, amidst the many false Manners and ill Stiles, the true and natural one, which represents the real Beauty and  90 discovering it-self in the Turns of Character , and the variety of human Affection , is copy'd by the writing Artist. If he knows not this Venus , these Graces , nor was ever struck with the Beauty , the Decorum of this inward kind, he can neither paint advantageously after the Life, nor in a feign'd Subject, where he has full scope. For never can he, on these Terms, represent Merit and Virtue , or mark Deformity and Blemish. Never can he with Justice and true Proportion assign the Boundarys of either Part , or separate the distant Characters. The Schemes must be defective, and the Draughts confus'd, where the Standard is weakly establish'd, and the Measure out of use. Such a Designer who has so little Feeling of these Proportions, so little Consciousness of this Excellence, or these Perfections, will never be found able to describe a perfect Character , or, what is more according to Art, "express the Effect and Force of this Perfection , from the Result of various and mixt Characters of Life." And thus the Sense of inward Numbers, the Knowledge and Practice of the social Virtues , and the Familiarity and Favour of the moral Graces are essential to the Character of a deserving Artist, and just Favourite of the Science of Virtuoso's , and that of Virtue it-self, become, in a manner, one and the same. careful to form his Judgment of Arts and Sciences upon right Models of Perfection. If he travels to Rome , he enquires which are the truest Pieces of Architecture, the best Remains of Statues, the best Paintings of a appear to him, at first sight; he resolves to view 'em over and over, till he has brought himself to relish 'em, and finds their hidden Graces and Perfections. He takes particular Care to turn his Eye from every thing that is gaudy, luscious, and of a false Taste. Nor is he less careful to turn his Ear from every sort of Musick, besides that which is of the best Manner, and truest Harmony. ' Twere to be wish'd we had the same regard to a right Taste in Life and Manners. Being once convinc'd of a difference in inward Character , and a Preference due to one Kind above another ; who wou'd not be concern'd to make his own the best? If Civility and Humanity be a Taste ; if Brutality, Insolence, Riot be in the same manner a Taste ; who, if he cou'd reflect, wou'd not chuse to form himself on the amiable and agreeable, rather than the odious and perverse Model? Who wou'd not endeavour to force Judgment in other Arts and Sciences? For in each place the Force on already form'd in us; why shou'd not we endeavour to form it, and become natural ?--- " I Like ! I fancy! I admire! How? By accident: or as I please ? No. But I learn to fancy, to admire, to please , as the Subjects themselves are deserving, and can bear me out. Otherwise, I like at this hour, but dislike the next. I shall be weary of my Pursuit, and, upon Experience, find little Pleasure in the main, if my Choice and Judgment in it be from no other Rule than that single one, because I please. Grotesque and monstrous Figures often please. Cruel Spectacles, and Barbaritys are also found to please , and, in some Tempers, to please beyond all other Subjects. But is this Pleasure right ? And shall I follow it, if it presents? Not strive with it, or endeavour to prevent its growth or prevalency in my Temper?---How stands the case in a more soft and flattering kind of Pleasure?--- Effeminacy pleases me. The Indian Figures, the Japan -Work, the Enamel strikes my Eye. The luscious Colours and glossy Paint gain upon my Fancy. A French or Flemish Stile is highly lik'd by me, at first sight; and I pursue my liking. But what ensues? ---Do I not for ever forfeit my good Relish? How is it possible I shou'd thus come to taste the Beautys of an Italian Master, or of a Hand happily form'd on Nature and the Antients? 'Tis not by Wantonness and Humour that I shall attain my End, and arrive at the Enjoyment I propose. The Art it-self is  91 severe: the Rules rigid. And if I expect the Knowledg shou'd come to me by accident, or in play; I shall be grosly deluded, and prove my-self, at best, but a Mock-Virtuoso , or mere Pedant of the kind." HERE we have once again exhibited our moral Science, in the same Method and Manner of Soliloquy as above. To this Correction of Humour and Formation of a Taste , our Reading, if it be of the right sort, must principally contribute. Whatever Company we keep; or however polite and agreeable their Characters may be, with whom we converse, or correspond; if the Authors we read are of another kind, we shall find our Palat strangely turn'd their way. We are the unhappier in this respect, for being Scholars ; if our Studys be ill chosen. Nor can I, for this reason, think it proper to call a Man well-read who reads many Authors : since he must of necessity have more ill Models, than good; and be more stuff'd with Bombast, ill Fancy, and wry Thought; than fill'd with solid Sense, and just Imagination. Reading; we are not, it seems, the least scrupulous in our Choice of Subject. We read whatever comes next us. What was first put into our hand, when we were young, serves us afterwards for serious Study, and wise Research, when we are old. We are many of us, indeed, so grave as to continue this Exercise of our youthful Gravity thro our remaining Life. The exercising-Authors of this kind have been above  92 describ'd, in the beginning of this Treatise. The Manner of Exercise is call'd Meditation , and is of a sort so solemn and profound, that we dare not so much as thorowly examine the Subject on which we are bid to meditate. This is a sort of Task -Reading, in which a Taste is not permitted. How little soever we take of this Diet; 'Tis sufficient to give full Exercise to our grave Humour, and allay the Appetite towards solid Research and Contemplation. The rest is Holiday, Diversion, Play, and Fancy. We reject all Rule ; as thinking it an Injury to our Diversions, to have regard to Truth or Nature : without which, however, nothing can be truly agreeable, or entertaining; much less, instructive, or improving. Thro a certain  93 Surfeit taken in a wrong kind of serious Reading, we apply our-selves, with full Content, to the most ridiculous. The more remote our Pattern is from any thing moral or profitable; the more Freedom and Satisfaction we find in it. We care not how Gothick or Barbarous our Models are; what ill-design'd or monstrous Figures we view; or what false Proportions we trace, or see describ'd in History, Romance, or Fiction. And thus our Eye and Ear is lost. Our Relish or Taste must of necessity grow barbarous, whilst Barbarian Customs, Savage Manners, Indian Wars, and Wonders of the Terra Incognita , employ our leisure Hours, and are the chief Materials to furnish out a Library. our Forefathers. I know not what Faith our valiant Ancestors may have had in the Storys of their Giants, their Dragons, and St. George's. But for our Faith indeed, as well as our Taste , in this other way of reading; I must confess I can't consider it, without Astonishment. the Taste and Judgment of many Gentlemen, whom we hear censur'd as Atheists , for attempting to philosophize after a newer manner than has been known of late. For my own part, I have ever thought this sort of Men to be in general more credulous, tho after another manner, than the mere Vulgar. Besides what I have observ'd in Conversation merely with the Men of this Character, I can produce many anathematiz'd Authors, who if they want a true Israelitish Faith, can make amends by a Chinese or Indian one. If they are short in Syria , or the Palestine ; they have their full measure in America , or Japan. Historys of Incas or Iroquois , written by Fryars and Missionarys, Pirates and Renegades, Sea-Captains and trusty Travellers, pass for authentick Records, and are canonical , with the Virtuoso's of this sort. Tho Christian Miracles may not so well satisfy 'em; they dwell with the highest Contentment on the Prodigys of Moorish and Pagan Countrys. They have far more Pleasure in hearing the monstrous Accounts of monstrous Men, and Manners; than the politest and best Narrations of the Affairs, the Governments, and Lives of the wisest and most polish'd People. Grecian , or a Roman ; an Ariosto to a Virgil ; and a Romance, or Novel, to an Iliad. We have no regard to the Character or Genius of our Author : nor are so far curious, as to observe how able he is in the Judgment of Facts , or how ingenious in the Texture of his Lyes. For Facts unably related, tho with the greatest Sincerity, and good Faith, may prove the worst sort of Deceit: And mere Lyes , judiciously compos'd, can teach us the  94 Truth of Things, beyond any other manner. But to amuse our-selves with such Authors as neither know how to lye , nor tell Truth , discovers a are with the travelling Memoirs of any casual Adventurer; that be his Character, or Genius, what it will, we have no sooner turn'd over a Page or two, but we begin to interest our-selves highly in his Affairs. No sooner has he taken Shipping at the Mouth of the Thames , or sent his Baggage before him to Gravesend , or Buoy in the Nore , but strait our Attention is earnestly taken up. If in order to his more distant Travels, he takes some Part of Europe in his way; we can with patience hear of Inns and Ordinarys, Passage-Boats and Ferrys, foul and fair Weather; with all the Particulars of the Author's Diet, Habit of Body, his personal Dangers and Mischances, on Land, and Sea. And thus, full of Desire and Hope, we accompany him, till he enters on his great Scene of Action, and begins by the Description of some enormous Fish , or Beast. From monstrous Brutes he proceeds to yet more monstrous Men. For in this Race of Authors, he is ever compleatest, and of the first Rank, who is able to speak of Things the most unnatural and monstrous. Taste in giving us a Moorish Hero, full fraight with Prodigy: a wondrous Story-Teller ! But for the attentive Part, the Poet chose to give it to Woman-kind. What passionate Reader of Travels , or Student in the prodigious Sciences, can refuse to pity that fair Lady, who fell in Love with the miraculous Moor ? especially considering with what sutable grace such a Lover cou'd relate the most monstrous Adventures, and satisfy the wondring Appetite with the most wondrous Tales; Wherein (says the Hero-Traveller) Of Antars uaste, and Desarts idle, It was my Hint to speak: And of the Cannibals that each other eat! The Anthropophagie! and Men whose Heads Do grow beneath their Shoulders. These to hear Wou'd Desdemona seriously incline. Fair-one. It's true, the Poet sufficiently condemns her Fancy; and makes her (poor Lady!) pay dearly for it in the end. But why, amongst his Greek Names, he shou'd have chosen one that denoted the Lady Superstitious , I can't imagine: unless, as Poets are sometimes Prophets too, he shou'd figuratively, under this dark Type , have represented to us, That about a hundred Years after his Time, the Fair Sex of this Island shou'd, by other monstrous Tales , be so seduc'd, as to turn their Favour chiefly on the Persons of the Tale- Tellers ; and change their natural Inclination for fair, candid, and courteous Knights, into a Passion for a mysterious Race of black Enchanters: such as of old were said to creep into Houses , and lead captive silly Women. Superstition , and that of Tales. The Love of strange Narrations, and the ardent Appetite towards unnatural Objects, has a near Alliance with the like Appetite towards the supernatural kind, such as are call'd prodigious , and of dire Omen. For so the Mind forebodes, on every Sight or Hearing of this kind. Fate, Destiny, or the Anger of Heaven, seems denoted, and as it were delineated, by the monstrous Birth, the horrid Fact, or dire Event. For this reason the very Persons of such Relators or Tale-tellers , with a small help of dismal Habit, sutable Countenance and Tone, become sacred and tremendous in the Eyes of Mortals, who are thus addicted from their Youth. The tender Virgins, losing their natural Softness, assume this tragick Passion, of which they are highly susceptible, especially when a sutable kind of Eloquence and Action attend the Character of the Narrator. A thousand Desdemona's are then ready to present themselves, and wou'd frankly resign Fathers, Relations, Countrymen, and Country it-self, to follow the Fortunes of a Hero of the black Tribe. foretel, either in the Gentlemen, Ladys, or common People, of an after Age; 'tis certain that as to Books, the same Moorish Fancy, in its plain and literal sense, prevails strongly at this present time. Monsters and Monster-Lands were never more in request: And we may often see a Philosopher, or a Wit, run a Tale-gathering in those idle Desarts , as familiarly as the silliest Woman, or merest Boy. our Philosophical Writers, who pretend to treat of Morals, shou'd far out-do mere Poets , in recommending Virtue, and representing what was fair and amiable in humane Actions. One wou'd imagine, that if they turn'd their Eye towards remote Countrys (of which they affect so much to speak) they shou'd search for that Simplicity of Manners, and Innocence of Behaviour, which has been often known among mere Savages; e'er they were corrupted by our Commerce, and, by sad Example, instructed in all kind of Treachery and Inhumanity. 'Twou'd be of Advantage to us, to hear the Causes of this strange Corruption in our-selves, and be made consider of our Deviation from Nature, and from that just Purity of Manners which might be expected, especially from a People so assisted and enlighten'd by Religion. For who wou'd not naturally expect more Justice, Fidelity, Temperance, and Honesty, from Christians , than from Mahometans , or mere Pagans ? But so far are our modern Moralists from condemning any unnatural Vices, or corrupt Manners, whether in our own or foreign Climates, that they wou'd have Vice it-self appear as natural as Virtue ; and from the worst Examples, wou'd represent to us, "That all Actions are naturally indifferent ; that they have no Note or Character of Good, or Ill, in themselves ; but are distinguish'd by mere Fashion, Law , or arbitrary Decree ." Wonderful Philosophy! rais'd from the Dregs of an illiterate mean kind, which was ever despis'd among the great Antients, and rejected by all Men of Action, or sound Erudition; but, in these Ages, imperfectly copy'd from the Original, and, with much Disadvantage, imitated, and assum'd, in common, both by devout and indevout Attempters in the moral kind. Lovers of the Art, declare to 'em, "That the Measure or Rule of Harmony was Caprice or Will, Humour or Fashion ;" 'Tis not very likely he shou'd be heard with great Attention, or treated with real Gravity. For Harmony is Harmony by Nature , let Men judg ever so ridiculously of Musick. So is Symmetry and Proportion founded still in Nature , let Mens Fancy prove ever so barbarous or Gothick , in their Architecture, Sculpture, or whatever other designing Art. 'Tis the same case, where Life and Manners are concern'd. The same Numbers, Harmony , and Proportion have place in Mankind; in which are lay'd the just Foundations of an Art and Science, superiour to every other of human Practice and Comprehension. comprehend. For Things are stubborn, and will not be as we fancy 'em, but as they stand in Nature. Now whether the Writer be Poet, Philosopher , or of whatever kind [illeg.] he is in truth no other than a Copist after lives in, or to the different Humour of his Age or Nation: His Manner, his Dress, his Colouring may vary. But if his Drawing be uncorrect, or his Design contrary to Nature; his Piece will be found ridiculous, when it comes thorowly to be examin'd. For Nature will not be mock'd. The Prepossession against her can never be very lasting. Her Decrees and Instincts are powerful. She has a strong Party abroad ; and as strong a one within our- selves : And when any Slight is put upon her, she can soon turn the Reproach, and make large Reprisals on the Taste and Judgment of her Antagonists. Prerogative of Nature , will easily be persuaded to apply himself to the great Work of reforming his Taste ; which he will have reason to suspect, if he be not such a one as has deliberately endeavour'd to frame it by the just Standard of Nature. Whether this be his Case, he will easily discover, by appealing to his Memory. For Custom and Fashion are powerful Seducers: And he must of necessity have fought hard against these, to have attain'd that Justness of Taste , which is requir'd in one who pretends to follow Nature. But if no such Conflict can be call'd to mind; 'tis a certain Token that the Party has his Taste very little different from the Vulgar. And on this account he shou'd instantly betake himself to the wholesom Practice recommended in this Treatise. He shou'd set afoot the powerfullest Facultys of his Mind, and assemble the best Forces of his Wit and Judgment, in order to make a formal Descent on the Territorys of the Heart : resolving to decline no Combat, nor hearken to any Terms, till he had pierc'd into its inmost Provinces, and reach'd the Seat of Empire. No Treatys shou'd amuse him; no Advantages lead him aside. All other Speculations shou'd be suspended, all other Mysterys resign'd; till this necessary Campaign was made, and these inward Conflicts learnt; by which he wou'd be able to gain at least some tolerable Insight into himself , and Knowledg of his own natural Principles. we have given, in relation to the forming of a Taste in Characters and Manners; we are still defective in our performance, whilst we are silent on supernatural Cases, and bring not into our Consideration the Manners and Characters deliver'd to us in Holy Writ. But this Objection will soon vanish, when we consider, that there can be no Rules given by human Wit , to that which was never humanly conceiv'd, but divinely dictated, and inspir'd. form his Characters, after the Models of our sacred Penmen. And whatever certain Criticks may have advanc'd concerning the Structure of a Heroick Poem of this kind; I will be bold to prophesy, that the Success will never be answerable to Expectation. Conquerors, Founders of Nations, Deliverers, and Patriots, who, even in a human Sense, are no way behind the chief of those so much celebrated by the Antients. There is nothing in the Story of  aeneas, which is not equal'd or exceeded by a Joshua or a Moses. But as illustrious as are the Acts of these sacred Chiefs, 'Twou'd be hard to copy them in just Heroick. 'Twou'd be hard to give to many of 'em that graceful Air, which is necessary to render 'em naturally pleasing to Mankind; according to the Idea Men have of Heroism , and Generosity. have us'd in order to separate ourselves from the Interests of mere Heathens , and Infidels ; notwithstanding the true pains we may have taken, to arm our Hearts in behalf of a chosen People , against their neighbouring Nations, of a false Religion, and Worship; there will be still found such a Partiality remaining in us, towards Creatures of the same Make and Figure with our-selves, as will hinder us from viewing with Satisfaction the Punishments inflicted by human Hands on such Aliens and Idolaters. Liberty of Thought and Easiness of Humour indulg'd to us, in which perhaps we are not so well able to contemplate the Divine Judgments, and see clearly into the Justice of those Ways , which are declar'd to be so far from our Ways , and above our highest Thoughts or Understandings. In such a Situation of Mind, we can hardly endure to see Heathen treated as Heathen ; and the Faithful made the Executioners of the Divine Wrath. There is a certain perverse Humanity in us, which inwardly resists the Divine Commission, tho ever so plainly reveal'd. The Wit of the best Poet is not sufficient to reconcile us to the Campaign of a JOSHUA, or the Retreat of a Moses , by the assistance of an Egyptian Loan. Nor will it be possible, by the Muses Art, to make that Royal Hero appear amiable in human Eyes, who found such favour in the Eye of Heaven. Such are mere human Hearts ; that they can hardly find the least Sympathy with that only one which had the Character of being after the Pattern of the Almighty's. Sacred Writ , are in no wise the proper Subject of other Authors than Divines themselves. They are Matters incomprehensible in Philosophy: They are above the Pitch of the mere human Historian , the Politician , or the Moralist ; and are too sacred to be submitted to the Poet's Fancy, when inspir'd by no other Spirit than that of his profane Mistresses, the Muses. great Poet, who sung so piously the Fall of Man. The War in Heaven , and the Catastrophe of that original Pair from whom the Generations of Mankind were propagated, are Matters so abstrusely reveal'd, and with such a resemblance of Mythology , that they can more easily bear what figurative Construction or fantastick Turn the Poet may think fit to give 'em. But shou'd he venture farther, into the Lives and Characters of the Patriarchs, the holy Matrons, Heroes and Heroines of the chosen Seed; shou'd he employ the sacred Machine , the Exhibitions and Interventions of Divinity, according to Holy Writ, to support the Action of his Piece; he wou'd soon find the Weakness of his pretended Orthodox Muse , and prove how little those Divine Patterns were capable of human Imitation, or of being rais'd to any other Majesty, or Sublime, than that in which they originally appear. different Turns and figurative Expressions, as suted the Fancy and Judgment of each Philosopher or Poet. But the Purity of our Faith will admit of no such Variation. The Christian Theology ; the Birth, Procedure, Generation , and personal Distinction of the Divinity , are Mysterys only to be determin'd by the initiated , or ordain'd ; to whom the State has assign'd the Guardianship and Promulgation of the Divine Oracles. It becomes not those who are un-inspir'd from Heaven, and un- commission'd from Earth, to search with Curiosity into the Original of those Holy Rites and Records, by Law establish'd. Shou'd we make such an Attempt; we shou'd in probability find the less Satisfaction, the further we presum'd to carry our Speculations. Having dar'd once to quit the Authority and Direction of the Law , we shou'd easily be subject to Heterodoxy and Errour , when we had no better Warrant left us for the Authority of our sacred Symbols , than the Integrity, Candour, and Disinterestedness of their Compilers , and Registers. How great that Candour and Disinterestedness may have been, we have no other Historys to inform us, than those of their own licensing or composing. But busy Persons, who officiously search into these Records, are ready even from hence to draw Proofs very disadvantageous to the Fame and Character of this Succession of Men. And Persons moderately read in these Historys, are apt to judg no otherwise of the Temper of antient Councils , than by that of later Synods and modern Convocations. been rais'd from the Disputes of this kind: What Effusion of Blood, what Devastations of Provinces; what Shock and Ruin of Empires have been occasion'd by Controversys, founded on the nicest Distinction of an Article relating to these Mysterys ; 'twill be thought vain in any Poet, or polite Author, to think of rendring himself agreeable, or entertaining, whilst he makes such Subjects as these to be his Theme. allotted as the peculiar Province of the Sacred Order ; 'Tis presum'd, nevertheless, that it may be lawful for other Authors to retain their antient Privilege of instructing Mankind, in a way of Pleasure, and Entertainment. Poets may be allow'd their Fictions, and Philosophers their Systems. 'Twou'd go hard with Mankind, shou'd the Patentees for Religion be commission'd for all Instruction and Advice, relating to Manners, or Conversation. The Stage may be allow'd to instruct, as well as the Pulpit. The way of Wit and Humour may be serviceable, as well as that of Gravity and Seriousness : And the way of plain Reason as well as that of exalted Revelation. The main Matter is to keep these Provinces distinct, and settle their just Boundarys. And on this account it is that we have endeavour'd to represent to modern Authors the Necessity of making this Separation justly, and in due form. ' Twou'd be somewhat hard, methinks, if Religion , as by Law establish'd , were not allow'd the same Privilege as Heraldry . 'Tis agreed on all hands, that particular Persons may design or paint , in their private Capacity, after what manner they think fit: But they must blazon only as the Publick directs. Their Lyon or Bear must be figur'd as the Science appoints: and their Supporters and Crest must be such as their wise and gallant Ancestors have procur'd for 'em. No matter whether the Shapes of these Animals hold just Proportion with Nature. No matter tho different or contrary Forms are join'd in one. That which is deny'd to Painters , or Poets , is permitted to Heralds. Naturalists may, in their separate and distinct Capacity, inquire, as they think fit, into the real Existence and natural Truth of Things: But they must by no means dispute the authoriz'd Forms. Mermaids and Griffins were the Wonder of our Forefathers; and, as such, deliver'd down to us by the authentick Traditions and Delineations above-mention'd. We ought not so much as to criticize the Features or Dimensions of a Saracen's Face, brought by our conquering Ancestors from the holy Wars; nor pretend to call in question the Figure or Size of a Dragon , on which the History of our national Champion, and the Establishment of a high Order , and Dignity of the Realm, depends. British Honour, and Antiquity; 'tis to be hop'd that in a more civiliz'd Age, such as at present we have the good fortune to live in, they will not attempt to strain their Privileges to the same height as formerly.

I. appear in many respects so nearly related, that they are generally presum'd inseparable Companions. And so willing we are to believe well of their Union , that we hardly allow it just to speak, or even think of 'em a-part. It may however be question'd, whether the  98 Practice of the World, in this respect, be answerable to our Speculation. 'Tis certain that we sometimes meet with Instances which seem to make against this general Supposition. We have known People, who having the Appearance of great Zeal in Religion , have yet wanted even the common Affections of Humanity , and shewn themselves extremely degenerate and corrupt. Others, again, who have paid little regard to Religion, and been look'd upon as mere Atheists , have yet been observ'd to practise the Rules of Morality , and act in many Cases with such good Meaning and Affection towards Mankind, as might seem to force an Acknowledgment of their being virtuous . And, in general, we find mere moral Principles of such weight, that in our dealings with Men, we are seldom satisfy'd by the fullest Assurance given us of their Zeal in Religion, till we hear something further of their Character. If we are told, a Man is religious, we still ask, "What are his Morals?" But if we hear at first that he has honest moral Principles, and is a Man of natural Justice and good Temper, we seldom think of the other Question, "Whether he be " religious and devout ?" consider'd by it-self; and in what manner it is influenc'd by Religion: How far Religion necessarily implies Virtue ; and whether it be a true Saying, That it is impossible for an Atheist to be Virtuous, or share any real degree of Honesty, or Merit ." Things shou'd appear somewhat unusual; since the Subject-Matter has been so little examin'd, and is of so nice and dangerous Speculation. For so much is the religious part of Mankind alarm'd by the Freedom of some late Pens; and so great a Jealousy is rais'd every where on this Account; that whatever an Author may suggest in favour of Religion , he will gain little Credit in the Cause, if he allows the least Advantage to any other Principle. On the other side, the Men of Wit and Raillery, whose pleasantest Entertainment is in the exposing the weak sides of Religion, are so desperately afraid of being drawn into any serious Thoughts of it, that they look upon a Man as guilty of foul Play, who assumes the air of a Free Writer , and at the same time preserves any regard for the Principles of Natural Religion. They are apt to give as little quarter as they receive: And are resolv'd  99 to think as ill of the Morals of their Antagonists, as their Antagonists can possibly think of theirs. Neither of 'em, it seems, will allow the least Advantage to the other. 'Tis as hard to persuade one sort, that there is any Virtue in Religion, as the other, that there is any Virtue out of the Verge of their particular Community. So that, between both, an Author must pass his time ill, who dares plead for Religion and Moral Virtue , without lessening the force of either; but allowing to each its proper Province, and due Rank, wou'd hinder their being made Enemys by Detraction. any thing effectually, within the intended Compass of this Inquiry ; 'tis necessary to take Things pretty deep; and endeavour, by some short Scheme, to represent the Original of each Opinion, whether natural or unnatural, relating to the Deity . And if we can happily get clear of this thorny part of our Philosophy; the rest, 'tis hop'd, may prove more plain and easy. Universe) either all is according to a good Order, and the most agreeable to a general Interest that is possible: or there is that which is otherwise, and might possibly have been better constituted, more wisely contriv'd, and with more Advantage to the general Interest of Beings, or of the Whole. best ; then of necessity there is no such thing as real ILL in the Universe, nothing ILL with respect to the Whole. or any way better order'd , is perfectly good . Whatsoever in the Order of the World can be call'd ILL, must imply a possibility in the nature of the thing to have been better contriv'd or order'd. For if it cou'd not; it is perfect, and as it shou'd be. by Design (that is to say, with Knowledg and Intelligence) or, in defect of this, by Hazard, and mere Chance. Universe from Design , then that which disposes all things, is no one good designing Principle. For either the one designing Principle is it-self corrupt; or there is some other in being which operates contrarily, and is ILL. Principle or Mind, whether Good or Bad, cannot be the Cause of all things. And consequently if there be suppos'd a designing Principle, who is the Cause only of Good, but cannot prevent the Ill which happens from Chance, or from a contrary ill Design; then there can be suppos'd in reality no such thing as a superiour good Design or Mind, other than what is impotent and defective: For not to correct, or totally exclude that Ill of Chance, or of a contrary ill Design, must proceed either from Impotency , or Ill-Will. with Discernment and a Mind, is what, by universal Agreement, Men call God . If there are several such superiour Minds, they are so many Gods : But if that single, or those several Superiours are not in their nature necessarily good, they rather take the name of D aemon. To believe therefore that every thing is govern'd, order'd, or regulated for the best , by a designing Principle, or Mind, necessarily good and permanent, is to be a perfect Theist. To believe nothing of a designing Principle or Mind, nor any Cause, Measure, or Rule of Things, but Chance ; so that in Nature neither the Interest of the Whole , nor of any Particulars , can be said to be in the least design'd, pursu'd or aim'd at; is to be a perfect Atheist. To believe no one supreme designing Principle or Mind, but rather two, three , or more (tho in their Nature good ) is to be a Polytheist. To believe the governing Mind, or Minds, not absolutely and necessarily good, nor confin'd to what is best, but capable of acting according to mere Will or Fancy; is to be a D aemonist. Hypothesis, upon any Subject so abstruse and intricate as the Cause of all Things , and the Oeconomy or Government of the Universe . For 'tis evident in the Case of the most devout People, even by their own Confession, that there are Times when their Faith hardly can support 'em in the Belief of a supreme Wisdom; and that they are often tempted to judg disadvantageously of a Providence, and just Administration in the Whole. other the most habitual to him, and occurs upon most Occasions. So that 'tis hard to pronounce certainly of any Man, that he is an Atheist ; because, unless his whole Thoughts are at all Seasons, and on all Occasions, steddily bent against all Supposition or Imagination of Design in Things , he is no perfect Atheist . In the same manner, if a Man's Thoughts are not at all times steddy and resolute against all Imagination of Chance, Fortune , or ill Design in Things, he is no perfect Theist . But if any one believes more of Chance and Confusion than of Design; he is to be esteem'd more an Atheist than a Theist , from that which most predominates, or has the Ascendant. And in case he believes more of the Prevalency of an ill- designing Principle, than of a good-one, he is rather a D aemonist, and may be justly so call'd, from the Side to which the Ballance of his Judgment most inclines. ALL these sorts both of D aemonism, Polytheism, Atheism , and Theism , may be  102 mix'd. Religion excludes only perfect Atheism . Perfect D aemonists undoubtedly there are in Religion; because we know whole Nations that worship a Devil or Fiend , to whom they sacrifice and offer Prayers and Supplications, in reality on no other account than because they fear him. And we know very well that, in some Religions, there are those who expresly give no other Idea of God , than of a Being arbitrary, violent, causing ill,  103 and ordaining to Misery; which in effect is the same as to substitute a D aemon , or Devil , in his room. Now since there are these several Opinions concerning a Superiour Power ; and since there may be found perhaps some Persons, who have no form'd Opinion at all upon this Subject; either thro Scepticism , Negligence of Thought, or Confusion of Judgment: the Consideration is, how any of these Opinions, or this want of any certain Opinion, may possibly consist with Virtue and Frame or Constitution either of Art or Nature; and consider how hard it is to give the least account of a particular Part without a competent Knowledg of the Whole : we need not wonder to find our-selves at a 105 loss in many things relating to the Constitution and Frame of Nature her- self. For to what End in Nature many things, even whole Species of Creatures, refer; or to what purpose they serve; will be hard for any one justly to determine: But to what End the many Proportions and various Shapes of Parts in many Creatures actually serve; we are able, by the help of Study and Observation, to demonstrate, with great exactness. which Nature has compell'd him to seek, by all the Advantages afforded him, within the Compass of his Make. We know that there is in reality a right and a wrong State of every Creature; and that his right-one is by Nature forwarded, and by Himself affectionately sought. There being therefore in every Creature a certain Interest or Good ; there must be also  106 a certain End , to which every thing in his Constitution must naturally refer. To this End if any thing either in his Appetites, Passions, or Affections be not conducing, but the contrary; we must of necessity own it ill to him. And in this manner he is ill, with respect to himself ; as he certainly is, with respect to others of his kind , when any such Appetites or Passions make him any way injurious to  107 them. Now if, by the natural Constitution of any rational Creature, the same Irregularitys of Appetite which make him ill to Others , make him ill also to Himself ; and if the same Regularity of Affections, which causes him to be good in one Sense, causes him to be good also  108 in the other ; then is that Goodness by which he is thus useful to others, a real Good and Advantage to himself. And thus Virtue and Interest may be found at last to agree. . Our first Design is, to see if we can clearly determine what that Quality is to which we give the Name of Goodness , or Virtue. to us a certain Creature of a more solitary Disposition than ever was yet heard of; one that had neither Mate nor Fellow of any kind; nothing of his own Likeness, towards which he stood well-affected or inclin'd; nor any thing without, or beyond himself, for which he had the least Passion or Concern: we might be apt to say perhaps, without much hesitation, "That this was doubtless a very melancholy Creature, and that in this unsociable and sullen State he was like to have a very disconsolate kind of Life." But if we were assur'd, that notwithstanding all Appearances, the Creature enjoy'd himself extremely, had a great relish of Life, and was in nothing wanting to his own Good; we might acknowledg perhaps, "That the Creature was no Monster , nor absurdly constituted as to himself ." But we shou'd hardly,  110 after all, be induc'd to say of him, "That he was a good Creature ." However, shou'd it be urg'd against us, "That such as he was, the Creature was still perfect in himself , and therefore to be esteem'd good: For what had he to do with others ?" In this sense, indeed, we might be forc'd to acknowledg, "That he was a good Creature ; if he cou'd be understood to be absolute and complete in himself; without any real relation to any thing in the Universe besides." For shou'd there be any where in nature a 111 System , of which this living Creature was to be consider'd as a Part ; then cou'd he no-wise be allow'd good ; whilst he plainly appear'd to be such a Part , as made rather to the harm than good of that System or Whole in which he was included. thing which points beyond himself, and by which he is plainly discover'd to have relation to some other Being or Nature besides his own; then will this Animal undoubtedly be esteem'd a Part of some other System. For instance, if an Animal has the Proportions of a Male, it shews he has relation to a Female. And the respective Proportions both of the Male and Female will be allow'd, doubtless, to have a joint-relation to another Existence and Order of things beyond themselves. So that the Creatures are both of 'em to be consider'd but as Parts of another System : which is that of a particular Race or Species of living Creatures, who have some one common Nature , or are provided for, by some one Order or Constitution of things subsisting together, and co-operating towards their Conservation and Support. of Animals contribute in their turn to the Existence or Well-being of some other Species; then are they all unitedly a Part of some other System. absolutely necessary. The heedless Flight, weak Frame and tender Body of this latter Insect, fits and determines him as much a Prey , as the rough Make, Watchfulness and Cunning of the former, fits him for Capture, and the ensnaring part. The Web and Wing are suted to each other. And in the Structure of each of these Animals, there is as apparent and perfect a relation to the other, as in our own Bodys there is a relation of Limbs and Organs; or, as in the Branches or Leaves of a Tree, we see a relation of each to the other, and all, in common, to one Root and Trunk. Creatures, both Fowls, and Fish. And thus are other Species or Kinds subservient to one another; as being Parts of a certain System , and included in one and the same Order of Beings. So that there is a System therefore of all Animals; an Animal-Order or Oeconomy , according to which the Animal Affairs are regulated and dispos'd. together with that of Vegetables, and all other things in this inferiour World, be properly comprehended in one System of a Globe or Earth: And if, again, this Globe 114 or Earth it-self appears to have a real Dependence on something still beyond; as, for example, either on its Sun, the Galaxy, or its Fellow-Planets; then is it in reality but a Part of some other System. And if it be allow'd, that there is in like manner a System of all Things, and a 115 Vniversal Nature ; there can be no particular Being or System which is not either good or ill in that general one of the Universe : For if it be insignificant and of no use, it is a Fault or Imperfection, and consequently ill in the general System. with respect to the Universal System; and then the System of the Universe is ill, or imperfect. But if the Ill of one private System be the Good of others; if it makes still to the Good of the general System (as when one Creature lives by the Destruction of another; one thing is generated from the Corruption of another; or one planetary System or Vortex may swallow up another) then is the Ill of that private System no real Ill in it-self; more than the pain of breeding Teeth is ill, in a System or Body which, without that occasion of Pain, wou'd suffer worse, by being defective. ill , unless we  116 can positively shew and ascertain, that what we call Ill is no where to any other Order or Oeconomy whatsoever. Species of Animals destructive to all the other Species, it might be justly call'd perhaps an ill Species; as being ill in the Animal-System . And if in any Species of Animals (as in Men , for example) one Man is of a nature pernicious to the rest, he is in this respect justly stil'd an ill Man. that he is an ill Man , because he has the Plague-Spots upon him, or because he has convulsive Fits which make him strike and wound such as approach him. Nor do we say on the other side, that he is a good Man , when having his Hands ty'd up, he is hinder'd from doing the Mischief he designs; or (which is in a manner the same) when he abstains from executing his ill purpose, thro a fear of some impending Punishment, or thro the allurement of some expected Pleasure or Advantage, which is not necessarily join'd with good Affection. which is not done thro any Affection at all, makes neither Good nor Ill in the nature of that Creature; who then only is suppos'd Good , when the Good or Ill of the System to which he has relation, is the immediate Object of some Passion or Affection moving him. or ill, natural or unnatural ; our business will be, to examine which are the good and natural , and which the ill and unnatural Affections. that if there be an Affection towards any Subject consider'd as private Good, which is not really such, nor any way essential to the Interest or Happiness of the Creature; this Affection, as being superfluous, and detracting from the Force of other requisite and good Affections, is it-self vicious and ill. is actually conducing to the private Interest of the Creature, and at the same time inconsistent with the publick Good; this still must be esteem'd a vicious Affection. And on this Supposition a Creature cannot be good and natural in respect of his Society or Publick, without being ill and unnatural towards Himself. Whereas, if the Affection be then only injurious to the Society, when it is immoderate, but not so when it is moderate, duly temper'd, and allay'd; then is the immoderate degree of the Affection vicious, but not the moderate . And thus, if there be found in any Creature a more than ordinary Self-Concernment, or Regard to private Good, which is inconsistent with the Interest of the Species or Publick; this must in every respect be esteem'd an ill and vicious Affection. And this is what we commonly call Selfishness , and disapprove so much, in whatever Creature we happen to discover it. selfish it may be esteem'd, is in reality not only consistent with publick Good, but in some measure contributing to it; if it be such, perhaps, as for the good of the Species in general, every Individual ought to share: 'tis so far from being ill, or blameable in any sense, that it must be acknowledg'd absolutely necessary to constitute a Creature Good . For if the Want of such an Affection as that towards Self-Preservation, be injurious to the Species; a Creature is ill and unnatural as well thro this Defect, as thro the Want of any other natural Affection. And this no-one wou'd doubt to pronounce, if he saw a Man who minded not any Precipices which lay in his way, nor made any Distinction of  121 Food, Diet, Clothing, or whatever else related to his Health and Being. The same wou'd be aver'd of one who had a Disposition which render'd him averse to any Commerce with Womankind, and of consequence unfitted him thro Illness of Temper (and not merely thro a Defect of Constitution ) for the Propagation of his Species or Kind. one. For if this private Affection be too strong (as when the excessive Love of Life , unfits a Creature for any generous Act) then is it undoubtedly vicious; and if vicious, the Creature who is mov'd by it, is viciously mov'd, and can never be otherwise than vicious in some degree, when mov'd by that Affection. Therefore if thro such an earnest and passionate Love of Life , a Creature be accidentally induc'd to do good (as he might be upon the same terms induc'd to do Ill ) he is no more a good Creature for this Good he executes, than a Man is the more an honest or good Man either for pleading a just Cause, or fighting in a good one, for the sake merely of his Fee or Stipend. Species, thro an Affection merely towards Self-Good, does not imply any more Goodness in the Creature than as the Affection it-self is good. Let him, in any particular, act ever so well; if at the bottom, it be that selfish Affection alone which moves him; he is in himself still vicious. Nor can any Creature be consider'd otherwise, when the Passion towards Self-Good, tho ever so moderate, is his real Motive in the doing that, to which a natural Affection for his Kind ought by right to have inclin'd him. or Succours an ill-dispos'd Creature may find, to push him on towards the performance of any one good Action; there can no Goodness arise in him till his Temper be so far chang'd, that in the issue he comes in earnest to be led by some immediate Affection, directly , and not accidentally , to Good, and against Ill. gentle, and favourable to Mankind, be, contrary to his natural Constitution, fierce and savage; we instantly remark the Breach of Temper , and own the Creature to be unnatural and corrupt. If at any time afterwards, the same Creature, by good  123 Fortune or right Management, comes to lose his Fierceness, and is made tame, gentle, and treatable, like other Creatures of his Kind; 'tis acknowledg'd that the Creature thus restor'd becomes good and natural. Suppose, now, that the Creature has indeed a tame and gentle Carriage; but that it proceeds only from the Fear of his Keeper ; which if set aside, his predominant Passion instantly breaks out: then is his Gentleness not his real Temper; but his true and genuine Nature , or Natural Temper remaining just as it was, the Creature is still as ill as ever. but what is from natural Temper ; a good Creature is such a one as by the natural Temper or Bent of his Affections is carry'd primarily and immediately , and not secondarily and accidentally , to Good, and against Ill: And an ill Creature is just the contrary; viz. one who is wanting in right Affections, of force enough to carry him directly towards Good, and bear him out against Ill; or who is carry'd by other Affections directly to Ill, and against Good. Good, or Good of the Species, as above-mention'd; then is the natural Temper intirely good. If on the contrary any requisite Passion be wanting; or if there be any one supernumerary, or weak, or any way disserviceable or contrary to that main End; then is the natural Temper, and consequently the Creature himself, in some measure corrupt and ill. THERE is no need of mentioning either Envy, Malice, Frowardness , or other such hateful Passions; to shew in what manner they are ill, and constitute an ill Creature. But it may be necessary perhaps to remark, that even as to Kindness and Love of the most natural sort (such as that of any Creature for its Offspring) if it be immoderate and beyond a certain degree, it is undoubtedly vicious. For thus over-great Tenderness destroys the Effect of Love, and excessive Pity renders us uncapable of giving succour. Hence the Excess of motherly Love is own'd to be a vicious Fondness ; over-great Pity, Effeminacy and Weakness ; over-great Concern for Self-preservation, Meanness and Cowardice ; too little, Rashness ; and none at all, or that which is contrary ( viz. a Passion leading to Self-Destruction) a mad and desperate Depravity. reach and capacity of all sensible Creatures , to that which is call'd Notions of Things, not only the outward Beings which offer themselves to the Sense, are the Objects of the Affection; but the very Actions themselves, and the Affections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their Contrarys, being brought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects. So that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind of Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been already felt, and are now become the Subject of a new Liking or Dislike. of Sense. The Shapes, Motions, Colours, and Proportions of these being presented to our Eye; there necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity, according to the different Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several Parts. So in Behaviour and Actions , when presented to our Understanding, there must be found, of necessity, an apparent Difference, according to the Regularity or Irregularity of the Subjects. Auditor of other Minds , cannot be without its Eye and Ear ; so as to discern Proportion, distinguish Sound, and scan each Sentiment or Thought that comes before it. It can let nothing escape its Censure. It feels the Soft, and Harsh, the Agreeable, and Disagreeable, in the Affections; and finds a Foul and Fair , a Harmonious , and a Dissonant , as really and truly here, as in the outward Forms or Representations of sensible Things. Sounds, are perpetually moving before our Eyes, and acting on our Senses, even in Sleep, and when the real Objects themselves are absent; so in the moral and intellectual kind, the Forms and Images of Things are no less active and incumbent on the Mind. necessity figures to it-self, and carries still about with it, the Heart cannot possibly remain neutral; but constantly takes part one way or other. However false or corrupt it be within it-self, it finds the Difference,  126 as to Beauty, and Comeliness, between one Heart and another, one Turn of Affection , one Behaviour , one Sentiment and another; and accordingly, in all disinterested Cases, must approve in some measure of what is natural and honest, and disapprove what is dishonest and corrupt. consequent Carriage and Behaviour of Creatures in the various Parts of Life, being in several Views or Perspectives represented to the Mind, which readily discerns the Good and Ill towards the Species or Publick; there arises a new Trial or Exercise of the Heart: which must either rightly and soundly affect what is just and right, and disaffect what is contrary; or, corruptly affect what is ill, and disaffect what is worthy and good. call any Creature Worthy or Virtuous , when it can have the Notion of a publick Interest, and can attain the Speculation or Science of what is morally good or ill, admirable or blameable, right or wrong. For tho we may vulgarly call an ill Horse vitious ; yet we never say of a good-one, nor of any mere Beast, Idiot, or Changeling, tho ever so good-natur'd, that he is worthy or virtuous. he cannot reflect on what he himself does, or sees others do, so as to take notice of what is worthy or honest ; and make that Notice or Conception of Worth and Honesty to be an Object of his Affection, he has not the Character of being virtuous: 128 for thus, and no otherwise, he is capable of having a Sense of Right or Wrong ; a Sentiment or Judgment of what is done thro just, equal, and good Affection, or the contrary. Affection, is iniquous, wicked , and wrong . If the Affection be equal, sound, and good, and the Subject of the Affection such as may with Advantage to Society be ever in the same manner prosecuted or affected; this must necessarily constitute what we call Equity and Right in any Action. For, rate a dutiful Son aiming at an Enemy, but by Mistake or ill Chance happening to kill his Father, wou'd do a Wrong ) but when any thing is done thro insufficient or unequal Affection (as when a Son shews no Concern for the Safety of a Father; or, where there is need of Succour, prefers an indifferent Person to him) this is of the nature of Wrong. in the Senses be the occasion of Iniquity or Wrong ; if the Object of the Mind it-self be not at any time absurdly fram'd, nor any way improper, but sutable, just, and worthy of the Opinion and Affection apply'd to it. For if we will suppose a Man, who being sound and intire both in his Reason and Affection, has nevertheless so deprav'd a Constitution or Frame of Body, that the natural Objects are thro his Organs of Sense, as thro ill Glasses, falsly convey'd and misrepresented; 'twill be soon observ'd, in such a Person's Case, that since his Failure is not in his principal or leading Part; he cannot in himself be esteem'd iniquous , or unjust. Belief or Speculation. For as the Extravagance of Judgment or Belief is such, that in some Countrys even Monkeys, Cats, Crocodiles, and other vile or destructive Animals have been esteem'd holy , and worship'd even as Deitys ; shou'd it appear to any one of the Religion or Belief of those Countrys, that to save such a Creature as a Cat, preferably to a Parent, was Right ; and that other Men, who had not the same religious Opinion, were to be treated as Enemys, till converted; this wou'd be certainly Wrong , and wicked in the Believer: And every Action, grounded on this Belief, wou'd be an iniquous , wicked and vicious Action. or Misapprehension of the Worth or Value of any Object, so as to diminish a due, or raise any undue, irregular, or unsocial Affection, must necessarily be the occasion of Wrong . Thus he who affects or loves a Man for the sake of something which is reputed honourable, but which is in reality vicious, is himself vicious and ill. The beginnings of this Corruption may be noted in many Occurrences: As when an ambitious Man, by the Fame of his high Attempts, a Conqueror or a Pyrate by his boasted Enterprizes, raises in another Person an Esteem and Admiration of that immoral and inhuman Character, which deserves Abhorrence: 'Tis then that the Hearer becomes corrupt, when he approves the Ill he hears. But on the other side, the Man who loves and esteems another, as believing him to have that Virtue which he has not, but only counterfeits, is not on this account either vicious or corrupt.  133 A Mistake therefore in Fact being no Cause or Sign of ill Affection, can be no Cause of Vice. But a Mistake of Right being the Cause of unequal Affection, must of necessity be the Cause of vicious Action, in every intelligent or rational Being. the most discerning part of Mankind appear difficult, and of doubtful Decision, 'tis not a slight Mistake of this kind which can destroy the Character of a virtuous or worthy Man . But when, either thro Superstition or ill Custom, there come to be very gross Mistakes in the assignment or application of the Affection; when the Mistakes are either in their nature so gross, or so complicated and frequent, that a Creature cannot well live in a natural State; nor with due Affections, compatible with human Society and Civil Life; then is the Character of Virtue forfeited. and Virtue depend on a knowledg of Right and Wrong , and on a use of Reason sufficient to secure a right application of the Affections; that nothing horrid or unnatural, nothing unexemplary, nothing destructive of that natural Affection by which the Species or Society is upheld, may, on any account, or thro any Principle or Notion of Honour or Religion, be at any time affected or prosecuted as a good and proper Object of Esteem. For such a Principle as this must be wholly vicious: and whatsoever is acted upon it, can be no other than Vice and Immorality. And thus if there be any thing  135 which teaches Men either Treachery, Ingratitude, or Cruelty, by Divine Warrant; or under colour and pretence of any present or future Good to Mankind: if there be any thing which teaches Men to persecute their Friends thro Love; or to torment Captives of War in Sport; or to offer human Sacrifice; or to torment, macerate, or mangle themselves, in a religious Zeal, before their God; or to commit any sort of Barbarity, or Brutality, as amiable or becoming: be it Custom that gives Applause, or Religion that gives a Sanction; this is not, nor ever can be Virtue , of any Kind, or in any Sense; but must remain still horrid Depravity, notwithstanding any Law,  136 Custom or Religion, which may be ill and vicious it-self ; but can never alter the eternal measures , and immutable independent Nature of Worth and Virtue. who are only capable of being mov'd by sensible Objects ; they are accordingly Good or Vicious , as the sensible Affections stand with them. 'Tis otherwise in Creatures capable of framing rational Objects of moral Good. For in one of this kind, shou'd the Sensible Affections stand ever so much amiss; yet if they prevail not, because of those other rational Affections spoken of; 'tis evident, the Temper still holds good in the main; and the Person is with Justice esteem'd virtuous by all Men. one is passionate, angry, fearful, amorous; yet resists these Passions, and notwithstanding the force of their Impression, adheres to Virtue ; we say commonly in this Case, that the Virtue is the greater : and we say well. Tho if that which restrains the Person, and holds him to a virtuous-like Behaviour, be no Affection towards Goodness or Virtue it-self, but towards private Good merely, he is not in reality the more virtuous; as has been shewn before. But this still is evident, that if voluntarily, and without foreign Constraint, an angry Temper bears, or an amorous one refrains, so that neither any cruel or immodest Action can be forc'd from such a Person, tho ever so Strongly tempted by his Constitution; we applaud his Virtue above what we shou'd naturally do, if he were free of this Temptation, and these Propensitys. At the same time, there is no body will say that a Propensity to Vice can be an Ingredient in Virtue, or any way necessary to complete a virtuous Character. amounts only to this. If there be any part of the Temper in which ill Passions or Affections are seated, whilst in another part the Affections towards moral Good are such as absolutely to master those Attempts of their Antagonists; this is the greatest Proof imaginable, that a strong Principle of Virtue lies at the bottom, and has possess'd it-self of the natural Temper. Whereas if there be no ill Passions stirring; a Person may be indeed more cheaply virtuous ; that is to say, he may conform himself to the known Rules of Virtue, without sharing so much of a virtuous Principle as another. Yet if that other Person, who has the Principle of Virtue so strongly implanted, comes at last to lose those contrary Impediments suppos'd in him, he certainly loses nothing in Virtue; but on the contrary, losing only what is vicious in his Temper, is left more entire to Virtue, and possesses it in a higher degree. by rational Creatures; such at least as are call'd rational ; but who come short of that sound and well-establish'd Reason, which alone can constitute a just Affection , a uniform and steddy Will and Resolution . And thus Vice and Virtue are found variously mix'd, and alternately prevalent in the several Characters of Mankind. For it seems evident from our Inquiry , that how ill soever the Temper or Passions may stand with respect either to the sensible or the moral Objects; however passionate, furious, lustful or cruel any Creature may become; however vicious the Mind be; or whatever ill Rules or Principles it goes by; yet if there be any Flexibleness or favourable Inclination towards the least moral Object, the least Appearance of moral Good (as if there be any such thing as Kindness, Gratitude, Bounty , or Compassion ) there is still something of Virtue left; and the Creature is not wholly vicious and unnatural. refuses to discover his Associates; and rather than betray them, is content to endure Torments and Death, has certainly some Principle of Virtue, however he may misapply it. 'Twas the same Case with that Malefactor, who rather than do the Office of Executioner to his Companions, chose to keep 'em company in their Execution. absolutely an Atheist ;" so it appears altogether as hard to pronounce of any Man, "That he is absolutely corrupt or vicious ;" there being few even of the horridest Villains who have not something of Virtue in this imperfect Sense. Nothing is more just than a known Saying, " That it is as hard to find a Man wholly, Ill, as wholly Good :" because wherever there is any good Affection left, there is certainly some Goodness or Virtue still in being. may now consider how it stands with respect to the Opinions concerning a (as has been explain'd) in a certain just Disposition, or proportionable Affection of a rational Creature towards the Moral Objects of Right and Wrong ; nothing can possibly in such a Creature exclude a Principle of Virtue, or render it ineffectual, except what 1\. Either takes away the natural and just Sense of Right and Wrong. --- 2\. Or creates a wrong Sense of it. 3\. Or causes the right Sense to be oppos'd, by contrary Affections. or advance the Principle of Virtue, but what either in some manner nourishes and promotes a Sense of Right and Wrong; or preserves it genuine and uncorrupt; or causes it, when such, to be obey'd; by subduing and subjecting the other Affections to it. the Subject of a Deity may influence in these Cases, or produce either of these three Effects. Away the natural Sense of Right and Wrong. the Notion of what is good or ill in the Species, or Society . For of the reality of such a Good and Ill , no rational Creature can possibly be insensible. Every one discerns and owns a publick Interest, and is conscious of what affects his Fellowship or Community. When we say therefore of a Creature, "That he has wholly lost the Sense of Right and Wrong;" we suppose that being able to discern the Good and Ill of his Species, he has at the same time no Concern for either, nor any Sense of Excellency or Baseness in any moral Action, relating to one or the other. So that except merely with respect to a private and narrowly confin'd Self-Good, 'tis suppos'd there is in such a Creature no Liking or Dislike of Manners; no Admiration, or Love of any thing as morally Good; nor Hatred of any thing as morally ill; be it ever so unnatural or deform'd. whatsoever, but knows that when he voluntarily offends or does harm to any one, he cannot fail to create an Apprehension and Fear of like harm, and consequently a Resentment and Animosity in every Creature who observes him. So that the Offender must needs be conscious to himself of being liable to such Treatment from every one, as if he had in some degree offended All. equal Behaviour (which is therefore call'd Merit ) as rewardable and well- deserving from every one. Of this even the wickedest Creature living must have a Sense . So that if there be any further meaning in this Sense of Right and Wrong; if in reality there be any Sense of this kind which an absolute wicked Creature has not; it must consist in a real Antipathy or Aversion to Injustice or Wrong , and in a real Affection or Love towards Equity and Right , for its own sake, and on the account of its own natural Beauty and Worth. constituted, and unnatural, as that from the moment he comes to be try'd by sensible Objects, he shou'd have no one good Passion towards his Kind, no Foundation either of Pity, Love, Kindness, or social Affection. 'Tis full as impossible to conceive, that a rational Creature coming first to be try'd by rational Objects, and receiving into his Mind the Images or Representations of Justice, Generosity, Gratitude, or other Virtue, shou'd have no Liking of these, or Dislike of their Contrarys; but be found absolutely indifferent towards whatsoever is presented to him of this sort. A Soul, indeed, may as well be without Sense , as without Admiration in the Things of which it has any knowledg. Coming therefore to a Capacity of seeing and admiring in this new way, it must needs find a Beauty and a Deformity as well in Actions, Minds, and Tempers, as in Figures, Sounds or Colours. If there be no real Amiableness or Deformity in moral Acts, there is at least an imaginary one of full force. Tho perhaps the Thing itself shou'd not be allow'd in Nature, the Imagination or Fancy of it must be allow'd to be from Nature alone. Nor can any thing besides Art and strong Endeavour, with long Practice and Meditation, overcome such a natural Prevention , or Prepossession of the Mind, in favour of this  144 moral Distinction. being as natural to us as natural Affection it-self, and being a first Principle in our Constitution and Make; there is no speculative Opinion, Persuasion or Belief, which is capable immediately or directly to exclude or destroy it. That which is of original and pure Nature, nothing but contrary Habit or Custom (a second Nature) is able to displace. And this Affection being an original one of earliest Rise in the Soul or affectionate Part; nothing but  146 contrary Affection, by frequent check and controul, can operate upon it, so as either to diminish it in part, or destroy it in the whole. no particular odd Mien or Gesture, which is either natural to us, and consequent to our Make, or accidental and by Habit acquired, can possibly be overcome by our immediate Disapprobation, or the contrary Bent of our Will, ever so strongly set against it. Such a Change cannot be effected without extraordinary Means, and the Intervention of Art and Method, a strict Attention, and repeated Check. And even thus, Nature, we find, is hardly master'd; but lies sullen, and ready to revolt, on the first occasion. Much more is this the Mind's Case in respect of that natural Affection and anticipating Fancy, which makes the Sense of Right and Wrong. 'Tis impossible that this can instantly, or without much Force and Violence, be effac'd, or struck out of the natural Temper, even by means of the most extravagant Belief or Opinion in the  147 World. religious or irreligious Belief of any kind, being able to operate immediately or directly in this Case, but only by the intervention of opposite or of favourable Affections; we may consider of this Effect in our last Case, where we come to examine the Agreement or Disagreement of other Affections with this natural and moral one which relates to Right and Wrong. wrong Sense or false Imagination of Right and Wrong. to Nature; as may be noted in those Countrys where, according to Custom or politick  149 Institution, certain Actions naturally foul and odious are repeatedly view'd with Applause, and Honour ascrib'd to them. For thus 'tis possible that a Man, forcing himself, may eat the Flesh of his Enemys, not only against his Stomach, but against his Nature, and think it nevertheless both right and honourable; as supposing it to be of considerable service to his Community, and capable of advancing the Name, and spreading the Terrour of his Nation. to a Deity ; and what effect they may have in this place. As to Atheism , it does not seem that it can directly have any effect at all towards the setting up a false  151 Species of Right or Wrong. For notwithstanding a Man may thro Custom, or by Licentiousness of Practice, favour'd by Atheism, come in time to lose much of his natural moral Sense ; yet it does not seem that Atheism shou'd of it- self be the cause of any estimation or valuing of any thing as Fair, Noble, and Deserving, which was the contrary. It can never, for instance, make it be thought that the being able to eat Man's Flesh, or commit Bestiality, is good and excellent in it-self . But this is certain, that by means of corrupt Religion , or Superstition , many things the  152 most horridly unnatural and inhuman, come to be receiv'd as excellent, good, and laudable in themselves. abominable is by Religion advanc'd, as the suppos'd Will or Pleasure of a Supreme Deity ; if in the Eye of the Believer it appears not indeed in any respect the less ill or odious on this account; then must the Deity of necessity bear the blame, and be consider'd as a Being naturally ill and odious, however courted, and follicited, thro Mistrust, and Fear. But this is what Religion, in the main, forbids us to imagine. It every where prescribes Esteem and Honour in company with Worship and Adoration. Whensoever therefore it teaches the Love and Admiration of a Deity , that has any apparent Character of Ill ; it teaches at the same time a Love and Admiration of that Ill , and causes that to be taken for good and amiable, which is in it- self horrid and detestable. his History represents him amorously inclin'd, and permitting his Desires of this kind to wander in the loosest manner; 'tis impossible but his Worshippers believing this History to be literally and strictly true, must of course be taught a greater Love of amorous and wanton Acts. If there 153 be a Religion that teaches the Adoration and Love of a God , whose Character it is to be captious, and of high resentment, subject to Wrath and Anger, furious, revengeful; and revenging himself, when offended, on others than those who gave the Offence: and if there be added to the Character of this God , a fraudulent Disposition, encouraging Deceit and Treachery amongst Men; favourable to a Few, tho for slight causes, and cruel to the rest: 'tis evident that such a Religion as this being strongly enforc'd, must of necessity raise even an Approbation and Respect towards the Vices of this kind, and breed a sutable Disposition, a capricious partial revengeful and deceitful Temper. For even Irregularitys and Enormitys of a heinous kind must in many cases appear illustrious to one, who considers them in a Being admir'd and contemplated with the highest Honour and Veneration. Deity there be nothing beyond common Form, nothing but what proceeds from mere Example, Custom, Constraint, or Fear; if there be, at the bottom, no real Heartiness, no Esteem or Love imply'd; the Worshipper perhaps may not be much misled as to his Notion of Right and Wrong. If in following the Precepts of his suppos'd God , or doing what he esteems necessary towards the satisfying of such his Deity , he is compell'd only by Fear , and contrary to his Inclination, performs an Act which he secretly detests as barbarous and unnatural; then has he an Apprehension or Sense still of Right and Wrong, and, according to what has been already observ'd, is sensible of Ill in the Character of his God ; however cautious he may be of pronouncing any thing on this Subject, or so thinking of it, as to frame any formal or direct Opinion in the case. But if by insensible degrees, as he proceeds in his religious Faith and devout Exercise, he comes to be more and more reconcil'd to the Malignity, Arbitrariness, Partiality, or Revengefulness of his believ'd Deity , his Reconciliation with these Qualitys themselves will soon grow in proportion; and the most cruel, unjust and barbarous Acts, will, by the power of this Example, be often consider'd by him, not only as just and lawful, but as divine, and worthily imitable. that he is just and good , must suppose that there is independently such a thing as Justice and Injustice, Truth and Falshood, Right and Wrong ; according to which he pronounces that God is just, righteous , and true . If  154 the mere Will, Decree , or Law of God be said absolutely to constitute Right and Wrong , then are these latter words of no significancy at all. For thus if each part of a Contradiction were affirm'd for Truth, by the Supreme Power, they wou'd consequently become true . Thus if one Person were decreed to suffer for another's fault, the Sentence wou'd be just and equitable . And thus, in the same manner, if arbitrarily, and without reason, some Beings were destin'd to endure perpetual Ill, and others as constantly to enjoy Good; this also wou'd pass under the same Denomination. But to say of any thing that it is just or unjust , on such a foundation as this, is to say nothing, or to speak without a Meaning. to a Supreme Being, who in his History or Character is represented otherwise than as really and truly just and good; there must ensue a Loss of Rectitude, a Disturbance of Thought, and a Corruption of Temper and Manners in the Believer. His Honesty will, of necessity, be supplanted by his Zeal, whilst he is thus unnaturally influenc'd, and render'd thus immorally devout. injury to the  155 Affections of Men, and disturbs and impairs the natural Sense of Right and Wrong; so on the other hand, nothing can more highly contribute to the fixing of right Apprehensions, and a sound Judgment or Sense of Right and Wrong, than to believe a God who is ever, and on all accounts, represented such as to be a actually a true Model and Example of the most exact Justice, and highest Goodness and Worth. Such a View of Divine Providence and Bounty, extended to All , and express'd in a constant good Affection towards the Whole , must of necessity engage us, within our Compass and Sphere, to act by a like Principle and Affection. And having once the Good of our Species or Publick in view, as our End or Aim, 'tis in a manner impossible we shou'd be misguided by any means to a wrong Apprehension or Sense of Right and Wrong. prove) is capable of doing great Good, or Harm; and Atheism nothing positive in either way. For however it may be indirectly an occasion of Mens losing a good and sufficient Sense of Right and Wrong; it will not, as Atheism merely, be the occasion of setting up a false Species of it; which only false Religion or fantastical Opinion, deriv'd commonly from Superstition and Credulity, is able to effect. made by other Affections to the natural Sense of Right and Wrong. Affection in any degree, must necessarily act according to it; if it happens not to be oppos'd, either by some settled sedate Affection towards a conceiv'd private Good , or by some sudden, strong and forcible Passion, as of Lust or Anger ; which may not only subdue the Sense of Right and Wrong, but the very Sense of private Good it-self; and overrule even the most familiar and receiv'd Opinion of what is conducing to Self-Interest. Methods by which this Corruption is introduc'd or increas'd. We are to consider only how the Opinions concerning a Deity can influence one way or another. Liking  157 or Dislike of moral Actions, and consequently a Sense of Right and Wrong, before such time as he may have any settled Notion of A God , is what will hardly be question'd: it being a thing not expected, or any way possible, that a Creature such as Man , arising from his Childhood slowly and gradually, to several degrees of Reason and Reflection, shou'd, at the very first, be taken up with those Speculations, or more refin'd sort of Reflections, about the Subject of God 's Existence. reflect, has, notwithstanding, many good Qualitys and Affections; as Love to his Kind, Courage, Gratitude, or Pity. 'Tis certain that if you give to this Creature a reflecting Faculty, it will at the same instant approve of Gratitude, Kindness, and Pity; be taken with any shew or representation of the social Passion, and think nothing more amiable than this, or more odious than the contrary. And this is to be capable of Virtue , and to have a Sense of Right and Wrong. 158 Notion one way or other, concerning the Subject of a God , he may be suppos'd to have an Apprehension or Sense of Right and Wrong , and be possess'd of Virtue and Vice in different Degrees; as we know by Experience of those, who having liv'd in such Places, and in such a manner as never to have enter'd into any serious Thoughts or Religion, are nevertheless very different among themselves, as to their Characters of Honesty and Worth: some being naturally modest, kind, friendly , and consequently Lovers of kind and friendly Actions ; others proud, harsh, cruel , and consequently inclin'd to admire rather the Acts of Violence and Power. Now, as to the Belief of a Deity ,  159 and how Men are influenc'd by it; we may consider, in the first place, on what account Men yield Obedience, and act in conformity to such a Supreme Being. It must be either in the way of his Power , as presupposing some Disadvantage or Benefit to accrue from him; or in the way of his imitate and resemble him. who is  160 consider'd only as powerful over his Creature, and inforcing Obedience to his absolute Will by particular Rewards and Punishments; and if on this account, thro Hope merely of Reward , or Fear of Punishment , the Creature be incited to do the Good he hates, or restrain'd from doing the Ill to which he is not otherwise in the least degree averse; there is in this Case (as has been already shewn) no Virtue or Goodness whatsoever. The Creature, notwithstanding his good Conduct, is intrinsecally of as little Worth, as if he acted in his natural way, when under no Dread or Terror of any sort. There is no more of Rectitude, Piety , or Sanctity in a Creature thus reform'd, than there is Meekness or Gentleness in a Tyger strongly chain'd, or Innocence and Sobriety in a Monkey under the Discipline of the Whip. For however orderly and well those Animals, or Man himself upon like Terms, may be induc'd to act, whilst the Will is neither gain'd, nor the Inclination wrought upon, but Awe alone prevails and forces Obedience; the Obedience is servile , and all that is done thro it merely servile . The greater degree of such a Submission or Obedience, is but the greater Servility ; whatever may be the Object. For, whether such a Creature has a good Master, or an ill one, he 161 is neither more or less servile in his own nature. Be the Master or Superiour ever so perfect, or excellent, yet the greater Submission caus'd in this Case, thro this Principle or Motive only, is but the lower and more abject Servitude, and implies the greater Wretchedness and Meanness in the Creature, who has those Passions of Self-Love so predominant, and is in his Temper so vicious and defective, as has been explain'd. Belief or Conception of a Deity , who is consider'd as Worthy and Good , and admir'd and reverenc'd as such; being understood to have, besides mere Power and Knowledg, the highest Excellence of Nature, such as renders him justly amiable to All; and if in the manner that this Sovereign and mighty Being is represented, or as he is historically describ'd, there appears in him a high and eminent regard to what is good and excellent, a Concern for the good of All , and an Affection of Benevolence and Love towards the Whole ; such an Example as  163 this must undoubtedly serve (as above explain'd) to raise and increase the Affection towards Virtue, and help to submit and subdue all other Affections to that alone. Belief is intire and perfect, there must be a steddy Opinion of the Superintendency of a Supreme Being, a Witness and Spectator of human Life, and conscious of all that is felt or acted in the Universe: So that in the perfectest Recess, or deepest Solitude, there must be One still presum'd remaining with us; whose Presence singly must be of more moment than that of the most August Assembly on Earth. In such  164 a Presence as this, 'tis impossible but as the Shame of guilty Actions must be the greatest of any; so must the Honour be, of well-doing, even under the unjust Censure of a World. And in this Case, 'tis very apparent how far conducing a perfect Theism must be to Virtue, and how great Deficiency there is in Atheism. and Hope of future Reward , added to this Belief, may further contribute towards Virtue, we come now to consider more particularly. So much in the mean while may be gather'd from what has been said above; That neither this Fear or Hope can possibly be of the kind call'd good Affections , such as are acknowledg'd the Springs and Sources of all Actions truly good . Nor can this Fear or Hope, as above intimated, consist in reality with Virtue, or Goodness; if it either stands as essential to any moral Performance, or as a considerable Motive to any Act, of which some better Affection ought, alone , to have been a sufficient Cause. in this religious sort of Discipline, the Principle of Self-Love , which is naturally  167 so prevailing in us, being no way moderated, or restrain'd, but rather improv'd and made stronger every day, by the exercise of the Passions in a Subject of more extended Self-Interest; there may be reason to apprehend lest the Temper of this kind shou'd extend it-self in general thro all the Parts of Life. For if the Habit be such as to occasion, in every Particular, a stricter Attention to Self-Good, and private Interest; it must insensibly diminish the Affections towards Publick Good, or the Interest of Society; and introduce a certain Narrowness of Spirit, which (as some pretend) is peculiarly observable in the devout Persons and Zealots of almost every religious Persuasion. it be true Piety , to love God for his own sake ; the over-sollicitous regard to private Good expected from him, must of necessity prove a diminution of Piety. For whilst God is belov'd only as the Cause of private Good, he is no otherwise belov'd than as any other Instrument or Means of Pleasure by any vicious Creature. Now the more there is of this violent Affection towards private Good , the less room is there for the other sort towards Goodness it-self , or any good and deserving Object, worthy of Love and Admiration for its own sake; such as GOD is universally acknowledg'd, or at least by the generality of civiliz'd or refin'd Worshippers. prove an Obstacle to Piety, as well as to Virtue and publick Love. For the stronger this Affection is in any one, the less will he be able to have true Resignation , or Submission to the Rule and Order of The Deity . And if that which he calls Resignation 169 depends only on the expectation of infinite Retribution or Reward, he discovers no more Worth or Virtue here, than in any other Bargain of Interest: The meaning of his Resignation being only this, "That he resigns his present Life, and Pleasures, conditionally for That which he himself confesses to be beyond an Equivalent; eternal Living, " in a State of highest Pleasure and Enjoyment ." suffer, by the Increase of the selfish Passion, in the way we have been mentioning; 'tis certain, on the other side, that the Principle of Fear of future Punishment, 170 and Hope of future Reward , how mercenary or servile soever it may be accounted, is yet, in many Circumstances, a great Advantage, Security, and Support to  171 Virtue. implanted in the Heart a real Sense of Right and Wrong, a real good Affection towards the  172 Species or Society; yet by the violence of Rage, Lust, or any other counter- working Passion, this good Affection may frequently be controul'd and overcome. Where therefore there is nothing in the Mind capable to render such ill Passions the Objects of its Aversion, and cause them earnestly to be oppos'd; 'tis apparent how much a good Temper in time must suffer, and a Character by degrees change for the worse. But if Religion interposing, creates a Belief that the ill Passions of this kind, no less than their consequent Actions , are the Objects of a Deity's Animadversion; 'tis certain that such a Belief must prove a seasonable Remedy against Vice, and be in a particular manner advantageous to Virtue. For a Belief of this kind must be suppos'd to tend considerably towards the calming of the Mind, and disposing or fitting the Person to a better Recollection of himself, and to a stricter Observance of that good and virtuous Principle, which needs only his Attention, to engage him wholly in its Party and Interest. and Punishment is capable of supporting those who thro ill Practice are like to apostatize from Virtue; so when by ill Opinion and wrong Thought, the Mind it-self is bent against the honest Course, and debauch'd even to an Esteem, and deliberate Preference of a vicious one; the Belief of the kind mention'd may prove on this occasion the only Relief and Safety. A Person , for instance, who has much of Goodness and natural Rectitude in his Temper, but withal, so much Softness, or Effeminacy, as unfits him to bear Poverty, Crosses or Adversity; if by ill Fortune he meets with many Tryals of this kind, it must certainly give a Sourness and Distaste to his Temper, and make him exceedingly averse to that which he may falsly presume the occasion of such Calamity or Ill. Now if his own  174 Thoughts, or the corrupt Insinuations of other Men present it often to his Mind, " That his Honesty is the occasion of this Calamity , and that if he were deliver'd from this Restraint of Virtue and Honesty , he might be much happier :" 'tis very obvious that his Esteem of these good Qualitys must in proportion diminish every day, as the Temper grows uneasy, and quarrels with it-self. But if he opposes to this Thought the Consideration, "That Honesty carries with it, if not a present , at least a future Advantage, such as to compensate that Loss of private Good which he regrets;" then may this injury to his good Temper and honest Principle be prevented, and his Love or Affection towards Honesty and Virtue remain as it was before. Regard or Love , there is rather an Aversion to what is good and virtuous (as, for instance, where Lenity and Forgiveness are despis'd, and Revenge highly thought of, and belov'd) if there be this Consideration added, "That Lenity is, by its Rewards, made the cause of a greater Self- Good and Enjoyment than what is found in Revenge," that very Affection of Lenity and Mildness may come to be industriously nourish'd, and the contrary Passion depress'd. And thus Temperance, Modesty, Candour, Benignity , and other good Affections, however despis'd at first, may come at last to be valu'd for their own sakes , the contrary Species rejected, and the good and proper Object belov'd and prosecuted, when the Reward or Punishment is not so much as thought of. we see that a virtuous Administration, and an equal and just Distribution of Rewards and Punishments, is of the highest  177 service; not only by restraining the Vicious, and forcing them to act usefully to Society; but, by making Virtue to be apparently the Interest of every one, so as to remove all Prejudices against it, create a fair reception for it, and lead Men into that path which afterwards they cannot easily quit. For thus a People rais'd from Barbarity or despotick Rule, civiliz'd by Laws, and made virtuous by the long Course of a lawful and just Administration; if they chance to fall suddenly under any Misgovernment of unjust and arbitrary Power, they will on this account be the rather animated to exert a stronger Virtue, in opposition to such Violence and Corruption. And even, where by long and continu'd Arts of a prevailing Tyranny, such a People are at last totally oppress'd, the scatter'd Seeds of Virtue will for a long time remain alive, even to  178 a second Generation; e'er the utmost Force of misapply'd Rewards and Punishments can bring them to the abject and compliant State of long- accustom'd Slaves. cause of Virtue, we must observe in this Case, that it is Example which chiefly influences Mankind, and forms the Character and Disposition of a People. For a virtuous Administration is commonly accompany'd with Virtue in the Magistrate. Otherwise it can be of little effect; and of no long duration. But where it is sincere and well-establish'd, there Virtue and the Laws must necessarily be respected and belov'd. So that as to Punishments and Rewards, their Efficacy is not so much from the Fear or Expectation which they raise, as from a natural Esteem of Virtue , and Detestation of Villany , which is awaken'd and excited by these publick Expressions of the Approbation and Hatred of Mankind in each Case. For in the publick Executions of the greatest Villains, we see generally that the Infamy and Odiousness of their Crime, and the Shame of it before Mankind, contribute more to their Misery than all besides; and that it is not the immediate Pain, or Death it-self which raises so much Horrour either in the Sufferers or Spectators, as that ignominious kind of Death which is inflicted for publick Crimes, and Violations of Justice and Humanity. stands thus in the Publick, so, in the same manner, as to private Familys . For Slaves and mercenary Servants, restrain'd and made orderly by Punishment, and the Severity of their Master, are not on this account made good or honest. Yet the same Master of the Family using proper Rewards and gentle Punishments towards his Children, teaches them Goodness, and by this help instructs them in a Virtue, which afterwards they practise upon other grounds, and without thinking of a Penalty or Bribe. And this is what we call a Liberal Education and a Liberal Service : the contrary Service and Obedience, whether towards God or Man, being illiberal , and unworthy of any Honour or Commendation. must be consider'd, that if by the Hope of Reward , be understood the Love and Desire of virtuous Enjoyment, or of the very Practice and Exercise of Virtue in another Life; the Expectation or Hope of this kind is so far from being derogatory to Virtue, that it is an Evidence of our loving it the more sincerely and for its own sake . Nor can this Principle be justly call'd selfish : for if the Love of Virtue be not mere Self-Interest, the Love and Desire of Life for Virtue's sake cannot be esteem'd so. But if the Desire of Life, be only thro the Violence of that natural Aversion to Death; if it be thro the Love of something else than virtuous Affection, or thro the Unwillingness of parting with something else than what is purely of this kind; then is it no longer any sign or token of real Virtue. the Promise or Hope of Life, and Fear of Death, or other Evil, be induc'd to practise Virtue, and even endeavour to be truly virtuous, by a Love of what he practises. Yet neither is this very Endeavour to be esteem'd a Virtue . For tho he may intend to be virtuous; he is not become so, for having only intended, or aim'd at it, thro Love of the Reward. But as soon as he is come to have any Affection towards what is morally good, and can like or affect such Good for its own sake , as good and amiable in it-self ; then is he in some degree good and virtuous, and not till then. Reflection upon private Good or Interest. For tho the Habit of Selfishness , and the Multiplicity of interested Views , are of little Improvement to real Merit or Virtue ; yet there is a necessity for the Preservation of Virtue , that it shou'd be thought to have no quarrel with true Interest , and Self-Enjoyment. the main, That Virtue causes Happiness, and Vice Misery , carrys with him that Security and Assistance to Virtue which is requir'd. Or tho he has no such Thought, nor can believe Virtue his real Interest, either with respect to his own Nature and Constitution, or the Circumstances of human Life; yet if he believes any Supreme Powers concern'd in the Affairs of Mankind, and interposing in behalf of the Honest and Virtuous, against the Impious and Unjust; this will serve to preserve in him still that just Esteem of Virtue, which might otherwise diminish. Or shou'd he believe little of the immediate or present Interposition of Providence in the Affairs of this Life ; yet if he believes a God dispensing future Rewards and Punishments to Vice and Virtue in another ; he carrys with him still the same Advantage  182 and Security; whilst his Belief is steddy, and in no wise wavering or doubtful. For it must be observ'd, that an Expectation and Dependency, so miraculous and great as this, must naturally take off from other inferiour Dependencys and Encouragements. Where infinite Rewards are thus inforc'd, and the Imagination strongly turn'd towards them, the other common and natural Motives to Goodness are apt to be neglected, and lose much by Disuse. Other Interests are hardly so much as computed, whilst the Mind is thus transported in the pursuit of a high Advantage and Self-Interest, so narrowly confin'd within our-selves. On this account, all other Affections towards Friends, Relations, or Mankind, are often slightly regarded, as being worldly , and of little moment, in respect of the Interest of our Soul . And so little Thought is there of any immediate Satisfaction arising from such good Offices of Life, that it is customary with many devout People zealously to decry all temporal Advantages of Goodness,  183 all natural Benefits of Virtue: and magnifying the contrary Happiness of a vicious State, to declare, "That except only for the sake of future Reward, and fear of future Punishment, they wou'd divest themselves of all Goodness at once, and freely allow themselves to be "most immoral and profligate." From whence it appears, that in some respects there can be nothing more fatal to Virtue, than the weak and uncertain Belief of a future Reward and Punishment. For the stress being laid wholly here, if this Foundation come to fail, there is no further Prop or Security to Mens Morals. And thus Virtue is supplanted and betray'd. Now as to Atheism : tho it be  184 plainly deficient and without Remedy, in the case of ill Judgment on the Happiness of Virtue ; yet it is not, indeed, of necessity the Cause of any such ill Judgment . It may be alledg'd perhaps, that without an absolute Assent to any Hypothesis of Theism , the Advantages of Virtue may be seen and own'd, and a high Opinion of it establish'd in the Mind. However, it must be confess'd, that the natural Tendency of Atheism is very different. Virtue, without conceiving high Thoughts of the Satisfaction resulting from the Love of it: And nothing but the Experience of such a Love is likely to make this Satisfaction be credited. The chief Ground and Support therefore of this Opinion of Happiness in Virtue , must arise from the powerful feeling of this Affection, and the Knowledge of its Power and Strength. But this is certain, that it can be no great  185 strengthning to the moral Affection, or support to the Love of Goodness, to suppose that there is neither Goodness nor Beauty in the Whole it- self; nor any Example, or Precedent of good Affection in any superior Being. Such a Belief as this must tend rather to the weaning the Affections from any thing amiable or self-worthy, and to the suppressing the very Habit and familiar Custom of admiring natural Beautys, or whatever in the Order of things is according to just Design, Harmony, and Proportion. For how little dispos'd must a Person be, to love or admire any thing as orderly in the Universe, who thinks the Universe it-self a Pattern of Disorder ? How unapt to reverence or respect any particular subordinate Beauty of a Part ; when even the Whole it-self is thought to want Perfection, and to be only a vast and insinite Deformity? distracted Universe, from whence many Ills may be suspected, and where there is nothing good or lovely that presents it-self, nothing that can satisfy in Contemplation, or raise any Passion besides that of Contempt, Hatred, or Dislike. Such an Opinion as this may by degrees imbitter the Temper, and not only make the Love of Virtue to be less felt, but help to impair and ruin the very Principle of Virtue, viz. natural and kind Affection. Belief of a God , whom he does not merely call good, but whom in reality he believes nothing but real Good , nothing but what is truly sutable to the exactest Character of Benignity and Goodness; such a Person believing Rewards or Retributions in another Life, must believe them annex'd to real Goodness and Merit, real Villany and Baseness, and not to any accidental Qualitys or Circumstances, in which respect they cannot properly be stil'd Rewards , or Punishments , but capricious Distributions of Happiness or Vnhappiness to Creatures . These are the only Terms on which the Belief of a World to come, can happily influence the Believer. And on these Terms, and by virtue of this Belief, Man may retain his Virtue and Integrity, even under the hardest Thoughts of human Nature; when either by any ill Circumstance or untoward Doctrine, he is brought to that unfortunate Opinion of Virtue's being naturally an Enemy to Happiness in Life. sound Theism . For whatever be decided as to a future Life, or the Rewards and Punishments of hereafter; he who, as a 187 sound Theist , believes a reigning Mind, sovereign in Nature, and ruling all things with the highest perfection of Goodness, as well as Wisdom and Power, cannot but of necessity believe Virtue to be naturally good and advantageous. For what is there that cou'd more strongly imply an unjust Ordinance, a Blot and Imperfection in the general Constitution of Things, than to suppose Virtue the natural Ill, and Vice the natural Good of any Creature? us to propose a further Advantage to Virtue, in the Theistical Belief above the Atheistical . The Proposition may at first sight appear over-refin'd, and of a sort which is esteem'd too nicely philosophical. But after what has been already examin'd, the Subject perhaps may be more easily explain'd. what has been already prov'd, but must be ill in some degree, by having any Affection or Aversion in a stronger degree than is sutable to his own private Good, or that of the System to which he is join'd. For in either Case the Affection is ill and vicious. Now if a rational Creature has that Degree of Aversion which is requisite to arm him against any particular Misfortune, and alarm him against the Approach of any Calamity; this is regular and well. But if after the Misfortune is happen'd, his Aversion continues still, and his Passion rather grows upon him; whilst he rages at the Accident, and exclaims against his private Fortune or Lot; this will be acknowledg'd both vicious in present , and for the future ; as it affects the Temper, and disturbs that easy Course of the Affections on which Virtue and Goodness so much depend. On the other side, the patient enduring of the Calamity, and the bearing up of the Mind under it, must be acknowledg'd immediately virtuous, and preservative of Virtue . Now according to  190 the Hypothesis of those who exclude a general Mind, it must be confess'd there can nothing happen in the Course of things to deserve either our Admiration, and Love, our Anger, or our Abhorrence. However, as there can be no Satisfaction at the best in thinking upon what Atoms and Chance produce; so upon disasterous Occasions, and under the Circumstances of a calamitous and hard Fortune, 'tis scarce possible to prevent a natural kind of Abhorrence and Spleen, which will be entertain'd and kept alive by the Imagination of so perverse an Order of Things. But in another Hypothesis (that of perfect Theism ) it is understood, " That whatever 191 the Order of the World produces, is in the main both just and good ." Therefore in the Course of Things in this World, whatever hardship of Events may seem to force from any rational Creature a hard Censure of his private Condition or Lot ; he may by Reflection nevertheless, come to have Patience, and to acquiesce in it. Nor is this all. He may go further still in this Reconciliation; and from the same Principle may make the Lot it-self an Object of his good Affection; whilst he strives to maintain this generous Fealty, and stands so well-dispos'd towards the Laws and Government of his higher Country. State of Sufferance, and make us in the best manner support whatever Hardships are to be endur'd for Virtue's sake. And as this Affection must of necessity cause a greater Acquiescence and Complacency with respect to ill Accidents, ill Men, and Injurys; so it cannot but of course produce still a greater Equality, Gentleness, and Benignity in the Temper. Consequently the Affection must be a truly good one, and a Creature the more truly good and virtuous, by possessing it. For whatsoever is the occasion or means of more affectionately uniting a rational Creature to his Part in Society, and causes him to prosecute the Publick Good, or Interest of his Species, with more Zeal and Affection than ordinary, is undoubtedly the Cause of more than ordinary Virtue in such a Person. and Love of Order, Harmony and Proportion, in whatever kind, is naturally improving to the Temper, advantageous to social Affection, and highly assistant to Virtue ; which is it-self no other than the Love of Order and Beauty in Society. In the meanest Subjects of the World, the Appearance of Order gains upon the Mind, and draws the Affection towards it. But if the Order of the World it-self appears just and beautiful; the Admiration and Esteem of Order must run higher, and the elegant Passion or Love of Beauty, which is so advantageous to Virtue, must be the more improv'd by its Exercise in so ample and magnificent a Subject. For 'tis impossible that  193 such a Divine Order shou'd be contemplated without  194 Extasy and Rapture; since in the common Subjects of Science, and the liberal Arts, whatever is according to just Harmony and Proportion, is so transporting to those who have any Knowledg or Practice in the kind. adequate (the Hypothesis of Theism being suppos'd false) the Passion still in it-self is so far natural and good, as it proves an Advantage to Virtue and Goodness; according to what has been above demonstrated. But if, on the other side, the subject of this Passion be really adequate and just (the Hypothesis of Theism being real, and not imaginary) then is the Passion also just, and becomes absolutely due and requisite in every rational Creature. the relation which Virtue has to Piety : The first being not compleat but in the latter : Since where the latter is wanting, there can neither be the same Benignity, Firmness, or Constancy, the same good Composure of the Affections, or Uniformity of Mind. Belief of a God. belongs. It remains now to inquire, What Obligation there is to Virtue ; or what 196 Reason to imbrace it. Creature must have all his Inclinations and Affections, his Dispositions of Mind and Temper, sutable, and agreeing with the Good of his Kind , or of that System in which he is included, and of which he constitutes a Part . To stand thus well affected, and to have one's Affections right and intire , not only in respect of one's self, but of Society and the Publick: This is Rectitude, Integrity , or Virtue . And to be wanting in any of these, or to have their Contrarys, is Depravity, Corruption , and Vice. the Passions and Affections of particular Creatures, there is a constant relation to the Interest of a Species , or common Nature . This has been demonstrated in the case of natural Affection , parental Kindness, Zeal for Posterity, Concern for the Propagation and Nurture of the Young, Love of Fellowship and Company, Compassion, mutual Succour, and the rest of this kind. Nor will any one deny that this Affection of a Creature towards the good of the Species or common Nature, is as proper and natural to him as it is to any Organ, Part or Member of an Animal-Body, or mere Vegetable, to work in its known Course, and regular way of Growth. 'Tis not more natural for the Stomach to digest, the Lungs to breathe, the Glands to separate Juices, or other Intrails to perform their several Offices; however they may sometimes be disorder'd or obstructed in their Operations. Creature such Affections as these towards the common Nature , or System of the Kind , together with those other which regard the private Nature , or Self-System ; it must necessarily happen, that in following the first of these Affections, the Creature must on many Occasions contradict and go against the latter . How else shou'd the Species be preserv'd? Or what wou'd signify that implanted natural Affection , by which a Creature thro so many Difficultys and Hazards preserves its Offspring, and supports its Kind? that there is a plain and absolute Opposition between these two Habits or Affections. It may be presum'd, that the pursuing the common Interest or publick Good thro the Affections of one kind , must be a hindrance to the Attainment of private Good thro the Affections of another . For it being taken for granted, that Hazards and Hardships, of whatever sort, are naturally the Ill of the private State; and it being certainly the Nature of those publick Affections to lead often to the greatest Hardships and Hazards of every kind; 'tis presently infer'd, "That 'tis the Creature's Interest to be without any publick Affection whatsoever." whatever else is of this generous kind, does by its nature take place of the self-interesting Passions, draws us out of ourselves, and makes us disregardful of our own Convenience and Safety. So that according  200 to a known way of reasoning on Self-Interest , that which is of a social kind in us, shou'd, of right, be abolish'd. Thus Kindness of every sort, Indulgence, Tenderness, Compassion, and in short, all natural Affection shou'd be industriously suppress'd, and, as mere Folly, and Weakness of Nature, be resisted and overcome; that, by this means, there might be nothing remaining in us, which was contrary to a direct Self-End ; nothing which might stand in opposition to a steddy and deliberate Pursuit of the most narrowly confin'd Self-Interest. "That in the System of a Kind or Species, the Interest of the private Nature is directly opposite to that of the common one ; the Interest of Particulars directly opposite to that of the Publick in general ." --- A strange Constitution! in which it must be confess'd there is much Disorder and Untowardness; unlike to what we observe elsewhere in Nature. As if in any vegetable or animal-Body, the Part or Member cou'd be suppos'd in a good and prosperous State as to it-self , when under a contrary Disposition, and in an unnatural Growth or Habit as to its Whole. demonstrate;  201 so as to make appear, "That what Men represent as an ill Order and Constitution in the Universe, by making moral Rectitude appear the Ill , and Depravity the Good or Advantage of a Creature, is in Nature just the contrary. That to be well affected towards the Publick Interest and one's own , is not only consistent, but inseparable: and that moral Rectitude, or Virtue , must accordingly be the Advantage, and Vice the Injury and Disadvantage of every Creature." they consider a Creature void of natural Affection, and wholly destitute of a communicative or social Principle, will suppose him, at the same time, either tolerably happy in himself, or as he stands abroad, with respect to his Fellow-Creatures or Kind. 'Tis generally thought, that such a Creature as this, feels but small Enjoyment in Life, and finds little Satisfaction in the mere sensual Pleasures which remain with him, after the Loss of social Enjoyment; and all that can be call'd Humanity or Good-Nature . We know that to such a Creature as this, 'tis not only incident , to be morose, rancorous and  203 malignant; but that, of necessity , a Mind or Temper thus destitute of Mildness and Benignity, must turn to that which is contrary, and be wrought by Passions of a different kind. Such a Heart as this must be a continual Seat of perverse Inclinations and bitter Aversions, rais'd from a constant ill Humour, Sourness, and Disquiet. The Consciousness of such a Nature, so obnoxious to Mankind, and to all Beings that approach it, must over-cloud the Mind with dark Suspicion and Jealousy, alarm it with Fears and Horrour, and raise in it a continual Disturbance, even in the most seeming fair and secure State of Fortune, and in the highest degree of outward Prosperity. is what, of their own accord, Men readily remark. Where there is this absolute Degeneracy, this total Apostacy from all Candour, Equity, Trust, Sociableness, or Friendship; there are few who do not see and acknowledg the Misery which is consequent. Seldom is the Case misconstru'd, when at worst . The misfortune is, we look not on this Depravity, nor consider  205 how it stands, in less degrees . The Calamity, we think, does not of necessity hold proportion with the Injustice or Iniquity. As if to be absolutely immoral and inhuman, were indeed the greatest misfortune and misery; but that to be it, in a little degree , shou'd be no misery nor harm at all! Which to allow, is just as reasonable as to own, that 'tis the greatest Ill of a Body to be in the utmost manner distorted and maim'd; but that to lose the use only of one Limb, or to be impair'd in some one single Organ or Member, is no Inconvenience or Ill worthy the least notice. their mutual Relation and Dependency, the Connexion and Frame of those Passions which constitute the Soul or Temper, may easily be understood by any one who thinks it worth his while to study this inward Anatomy. 'Tis certain that the Order or Symmetry of this inward Part is, in it-self, no less real and exact, than that of the Body . However, 'tis apparent that few of us endeavour to become Anatomists of this sort. Nor is any one asham'd of the deepest Ignorance in such a Subject. For notwithstanding the greatest Misery and Ill is generally own'd to be from Disposition , and Temper ; notwithstanding 'tis allow'd that Temper may often change, and that it actually varys on many occasions, much to our disadvantage; yet how this matter is brought about, we inquire not. We never trouble our-selves to consider thorowly by what means or methods our inward Constitution comes at any time to  207 be impair'd or injur'd. The Solutio Continui , which real Surgeons talk of, is never apply'd in this case, by Surgeons of another sort. The Notion of a Whole and Parts is not apprehended in this Science. We know not what the effect is, of straining any Affection, indulging any wrong Passion, or relaxing any proper and natural Habit, or good Inclination. Nor can we conceive how a particular Action shou'd have such a sudden Influence on the whole Mind, as to make the Person an immediate Sufferer. We suppose rather that a Man may violate his Faith, commit any Wickedness unfamiliar to him before, engage in any Vice or Villany, without the least prejudice to himself , or any Misery naturally following from the ill Action. what is he the worse for it?" Yet speaking of any Nature thorowly savage, curst, and inveterate, we say truly, "Such a one is a plague and torment to himself:" And we allow, "That thro certain Humours , or Passions , and from Temper merely, a Man may be compleatly miserable; let his Circumstances be ever so fortunate." These different Judgments sufficiently demonstrate that we are not accustom'd to think with much Coherency on these moral Subjects; and that our Notions, in this respect, are not a little confus'd, and contradictory. Temper appear'd such to us as it really is; if we saw it impossible to remove hence any one good or orderly Affection, or introduce any ill or disorderly one, without drawing on, in some degree , that dissolute State, which at its height is confess'd to be so miserable; 'twou'd then undoubtedly be confess'd, that since no ill immoral or unjust Action cou'd be committed without either a new inroad and breach on the Temper and Passions, or a farther advancing of that Execution already begun, whoever did ill, or acted in prejudice of his Integrity, Good-Nature, or Worth, wou'd of necessity act with greater Cruelty towards himself, than he who scrupled not to swallow what was poisonous, or who with his own hands shou'd voluntarily mangle or wound his natural Body, Limbs, or outward Constitution. 209 otherwise than thro Affections or Passions, such as are proper to an Animal. For in convulsive Fits, where a Creature strikes either himself or others, 'tis a simple Mechanism, an Engine, or Piece of Clock-work that acts, and not the Animal. 210 only thro some Affection or Passion, as of Fear, Love, or Hatred moving him. stronger, so it is impossible but that where the Affections or Passions are strongest in the main, and form in general the most considerable Party, either by their Force or Number; thither the Animal must incline: And according to this Ballance he must be govern'd and led to Action. 211 either, 1\. The natural Affections , which lead to the Good of The Publick. 2\. Or the Self-Affections , which lead only to the Good of The Private. 3\. Or such as are neither of these; nor tending either to any Good of justly stil'd unnatural Affections. So that according as these Affections stand, a Creature must be good or ill, virtuous or vicious. The two former may be vicious or virtuous, according to their degree. of natural Affections as too strong , or of Self-Affections as too weak . But to clear this Difficulty, we must call to mind what has been already explain'd, "That natural Affection may, in particular Cases, be excessive, and in an unnatural degree:" As when Pity is so overcoming as to destroy its own End, and prevent the Succour and Relief requir'd; or as when Love to the Offspring proves such a Fondness as destroys the Parent, and consequently the Offspring it-self. And notwithstanding it may seem harsh to call that unnatural and vicious , which is but an Extreme of some natural and kind Affection;  213 yet 'tis most certain, that whereever any single good Affection of this sort is over-great, it must be injurious to the rest, and detract in some measure from their Force and natural Operation. For a Creature possess'd with such an immoderate Degree of Passion, must of necessity allow too much to that one , and too little to others of the same Character, and equally natural and useful as to their End. And this must necessarily be the occasion of Partiality and Injustice, whilst only one Duty or natural Part is earnestly follow'd, and other Parts or Dutys neglected, which shou'd accompany it, and perhaps take place and be prefer'd. nobler kind, may in some Characters be strain'd beyond its natural Proportion, and be said also to be in too high a Degree . For as the End of Religion is to render us more perfect, and accomplish'd in all moral Dutys and Performances; if by the height of devout Extasy and Contemplation we are rather disabled in this respect, and render'd more unapt to the real Dutys and Offices of civil Life, it may be said that Religion is then too strong in us. For how, possibly, we can call this Superstition , I can't see; whilst the Object of the Devotion is acknowledg'd just, and the Faith orthodox. 'Tis only the Excess of Zeal, which, in this Case, is so transporting, as to render the devout Person more remiss in secular Affairs, and less concern'd for the inferiour and temporal Interests of Mankind. too high ; so private Affection may, on the other hand, be too weak . For if a Creature be self-neglectful, and insensible of Danger; or if he want such a degree of Passion in any kind, as is useful to preserve, sustain, or defend himself; this must certainly be esteem'd vicious, in regard of the Design and End of Nature. She her-self discovers this in her known Method and stated Rule of Operation. 'Tis certain, that her provisionary Care and Concern for the whole Animal must at least be equal to her Concern for a single Part or Member. Now to the several Parts she has given, we see, proper Affections, sutable to their Interest and Security; so that even without our Consciousness, they act in their own Defence, and for their own Benefit and Preservation. Thus an Eye , in its natural State, fails not to shut together, of its own accord, unknowingly to us, by a peculiar Caution and Timidity; which if  214 it wanted, however we might intend the Preservation of our Eye, we shou'd not in effect be able to preserve it, by any Observation or Forecast of our own. To be wanting therefore in those principal Affections, which respect the Good of the whole Constitution, must be a Vice and Imperfection, as great surely in the principal part (the Soul or Temper) as it is in any of those inferiour and subordinate parts to want the self-preserving Affections which are proper to them. essential to Goodness. For tho no Creature can be call'd good, or virtuous, merely for possessing these Affections; yet since it is impossible that the publick Good, or Good of the System, can be preserv'd without them; it follows that a Creature really wanting in them, is in reality wanting in some degree to Goodness and natural Rectitude; and may thus be esteem'd vicious and defective. good ; when his Affection towards others is so warm and zealous, as to carry him even beyond his Part ; or when he really acts beyond it, not thro too warm a Passion of that sort, but thro an over-cool one of another, or thro want of some Self- Passion to restrain him within due Bounds. strong, (where the Self-Affections are overmuch so) or the having the Self- Affections defective or weak, (where the natural Affections are also weak) may prove upon occasion the only Cause of a Creature's acting honestly and in moral proportion. For, thus, One who is to a fault regardless of his Life, may with the smallest degree of natural Affection do all that can be expected from the highest Pitch of social Love, or zealous Friendship. And thus, on the other hand, a Creature excessively timorous may, by as exceeding a degree of natural Affection, perform whatever the perfectest Courage is able to inspire. To this I answer. That whenever we charge any Passion as too strong , or complain of any as too weak ; we must speak with respect to a certain Constitution or Oeconomy of a particular Creature, or Species. For if a Passion, leading to any right end, be only so much the more serviceable and effectual, for being strong; if we may be assur'd that the strength of it will not be the occasion of any disturbance within, nor of any disproportion  215 between it-self and other Affections; then consequently the Passion, however strong, cannot be condemn'd as vicious. But if to have all the Passions in equal proportion with it, be what the Constitution of the Creature cannot bear; so that only some Passions are rais'd to this height, whilst others are not, nor can possibly be wrought up to the same proportion; then may those strong Passions, tho of the better kind, be call'd excessive. For being in unequal proportion to the others, and causing an ill Ballance in the Affection at large, they must of course be the occasion of Inequality in the Conduct, and incline the Party to a wrong moral Practice. 216 from Instances in the Species or Kinds below us. As for the Creatures who have no manner of Power or Means given them by Nature for their defence against Violence, nor any thing by which they can make themselves formidable to such as injure or offend them; 'tis necessary they shou'd have an extraordinary degree of Fear, but little or no Animosity, such as might cause 'em to make Resistance, or incline 'em to delay their Flight. For in this their Safety lies, and to this the Passion of Fear is serviceable by keeping the Senses on the watch, and holding the Spirits in readiness to give the start. according to the Oeconomy of a particular Creature, both with respect to himself, and to the rest of his Species. On the other hand, Courage may be contrary to his Oeconomy ; and therefore vicious. Even in one and the same Species, this is by Nature differently order'd; with respect to different Sexes, Ages, and Growths. The tamer Creatures of the grazing kind, who live in Herds, are different from the wilder, who herd not, but live in Pairs only, apart from Company, as is natural and sutable to their rapacious Life. Yet is there found, even among the former inoffensive kind, a Courage proportionable to their Make and Strength. At a time of danger, when the whole Herd flies, the Bull alone makes head against the Lion, or whatever other invading Beast of Prey, and shews himself conscious of his Make . Even the Female of this kind is arm'd, we see, by Nature, in some degree, to resist Violence; so as not to fly a common Danger. As for a Hind, or Doe, or any other inoffensive and mere defenceless Creature; 'tis no way unnatural or vicious in them, when the Enemy approaches, to desert their Offspring, and fly for Safety. But for Creatures that are able to make  217 Resistance, and are by Nature arm'd offensively; be they of the poorest Insect-kind, such as Bees or Wasps; 'tis natural to 'em to be rous'd with Fury, and at the hazard of their Lives, oppose any Enemy or Invader of their Species. For by this known Passion in the Creature, the Species it-self is secur'd; when by Experience 'tis found that the Creature, tho unable to repel the Injury, yet voluntarily exposes his Life for the Punishment of the Invader; and suffers not his Kind to be injur'd with Impunity. And of all other Creatures, Man is in this Sense the most formidable: since if he thinks it just and exemplary, he may possibly in his own, or in his Country's Cause, revenge an Injury on any one living; and by throwing away his own Life (if he be resolute to that degree) is almost certain Master of another's, however strongly guarded. Examples of this nature have often serv'd to restrain those in Power, from using it to the utmost Extent, and urging their Inferiours to Extremity. 218 or Passions in an Animal-Constitution, as with the Cords or Strings of a Musical Instrument. If these, tho in ever so just proportion one to another, are strain'd beyond a certain degree, 'tis more than the Instrument will bear: The Lute or Lyre is abus'd, and its Effect lost. On the other hand, if while some of the Strings are duly strain'd, others are not wound up to their due proportion; then is the Instrument still in disorder, and its Part ill perform'd. The several Species of Creatures are like different sorts of Instruments: And even in the same Species of Creatures (as in the same sort of Instrument) one is not intirely like the other , nor will the same Strings fit each. The same degree of Strength which winds up one , and fits the several Strings to a just Harmony and Consort, may in another burst both the Strings and Instrument it-self. Thus Men who have the liveliest Sense, and are the easiest affected with Pain or Pleasure, have need of the strongest Influence or Force of other Affections, such as Tenderness, Love, Sociableness, Compassion, in order to preserve a right Ballance within , and to  219 maintain them in their Duty, and in the just performance of their Part: whilst others, who are of a cooler Blood, or lower Key, need not the same Allay or Counter-part; nor are made by Nature to feel those tender and indearing Affections in so exquisite a degree. Tunings 220 of the Passions, the various Mixtures and Allays by which Men become so different from one another. For as the highest  221 Improvements of Temper are made in Human kind; so the greatest Corruptions and Degeneracys are discoverable in this Race. In the other Species of Creatures around us, there is found generally an exact Proportionableness, Constancy and Regularity in all their Passions and Affections; no failure in the care of the Offspring, or of the Society, to which they are united; no Prostitution of themselves; no Intemperance, or Excess, in any kind. The smaller Creatures, who live as it were in Citys (as Bees and Ants) continue the same Train and Harmony of Life: Nor are they ever false to those Affections, which move them to operate towards their Publick Good. Even those Creatures of Prey, who live the farthest out of Society, maintain, we see, such a Conduct towards one another, as is exactly sutable to the Good of their own Species. Whilst Man, notwithstanding the Assistance of Religion, and the Direction of Laws, is often found to live in less conformity with Nature; and by means of Religion it-self, is often render'd the more barbarous and inhuman. Marks are set on Men: Distinctions form'd: Opinions decreed, under the severest Penaltys: Antipathys instill'd, and Aversions rais'd in Men against the generality of their own Species. So that 'tis hard to find in any Region a human Society that has human Laws. No wonder if in such Societys 'tis so hard to find a Man who lives Naturally , and as a Man. 222 too low a degree; and that, "To have any natural Affection too high, or any Self-Affection too low," tho it be often approv'd as Virtue , is yet, strictly speaking, a Vice and Imperfection ; we come now to the plainer and more essential part of Vice , and which alone deserves to be consider'd as such : that is to say, 1\. " When either the publick Affections are weak or deficient;" 2\. " Or the private and Self-Affections too strong." 3\. " Or that such Affections arise as are neither of these, nor in any degree tending to the Support either of the publick or private System." call Ill or Vicious . So that if once we prove that it is really not the Creature's Interest to be thus viciously affected, but  223 contrariwise; we shall then have prov'd, "That it is his Interest to be wholly Affections, such as we have describ'd, he cannot possibly be other than sound, good and virtuous , in his Action and Behaviour. I. " That to have the Natural , Kindly , or Generous Affections strong and powerful towards the Good of the Publick, is to have the chief Means and Power of Self-Enjoyment ." And, " That to want them, is certain Misery and Ill ." II. " That to have The Private or Self-Affections too strong, or beyond their degree of Subordinacy to the kindly and natural, is also miserable ." III. And , " That to have The Unnatural Affections ( viz. such as are neither founded on the Interest of the Kind, or Publick ; nor of the Private Person, or Creature himself) is to be miserable in the highest degree ." " That to have the Natural Affections (such as are founded in Love, Complacency, Good-will, and in a Sympathy with the Kind or Species) is to have the chief Means and Power of Self-Enjoyment : And That to want them is certain Misery and Ill ." Satisfactions ;  225 from whence Happiness is generally computed. They are (according to the common distinction) either Satisfactions and Pleasures of the Body , or of the Mind. the greatest , is allow'd by most People, and may be prov'd by this: That whenever the Mind, having conceiv'd a high Opinion of the Worth of any Action or Behaviour, has receiv'd the strongest Impression of this sort, and is wrought up to the highest pitch or degree of Passion towards the Subject; at such time it sets it-self above all bodily Pain as well as Pleasure, and can be no way diverted from its purpose by Flattery or Terrour of any kind. Thus we see Indians, Barbarians, Malefactors , and even the most execrable Villains , for the sake of a particular Gang or Society, or thro some cherish'd Notion or Principle of Honour or Gallantry, Revenge, or Gratitude, embrace any manner of Hardship, and defy Torments and Death. Whereas on the other hand, a Person being plac'd in all the happy Circumstances of outward Enjoyment, surrounded with every thing that can allure or charm the Sense, and being then actually in the very moment of such a pleasing Indulgence; yet no sooner is there any thing amiss within , no sooner has he conceiv'd any internal Ail or Disorder , any thing inwardly vexatious or distemper'd, but instantly his Enjoyment ceases, the pleasure of Sense is at an end; and every means of that sort becomes ineffectual, and is rejected as uneasy, and subject to give Distast. 227 of the Body ; it follows, "That whatever can create in any intelligent Being a constant flowing Series or Train of mental Enjoyments, or Pleasures of the Mind, is more considerable to his Happiness, than that which can create to him a like constant Course or Train of sensual Enjoyments, or Pleasures of the Body." Now the mental Enjoyments are either  228 actually the very natural Affections themselves in their immediate Operation : Or they wholly in a manner proceed from them , and are no other than their Effects. rational Creature, being the only Means that can procure him a constant Series or Succession of the mental Enjoyments, they are the only means which can procure him a certain and solid Happiness. "How much the natural Affections are in themselves the highest Pleasures and Enjoyments :" There shou'd methinks be little need of proving this to any one of human kind, who has ever known the Condition of the Mind under a lively Affection of Love, Gratitude, Bounty, Generosity, Pity, Succour, or whatever else is of a social or friendly sort. He who has ever so little knowledg of human Nature, is sensible 230 what pleasure the Mind perceives when it is touch'd in this generous way. The Difference we find between Solitude and Company; between a common Company and that of Friends; the reference of almost all our Pleasures to mutual Converse, and the dependence they have on Society either present or imagin'd; all these are sufficient Proofs in our behalf. How much the social Pleasures are superiour to any other, may be known by visible Tokens and Effects. The very outward Features, the Marks and Signs which attend this sort of Joy, are expressive of a more intense, clear and undisturb'd Pleasure, than those which attend the Satisfaction of Thirst, Hunger, and other ardent Appetites. But more particularly still may this Superiority be known, from the actual Prevalence and Ascendency of this sort of Affection over all besides. Wherever it presents it-self with any Advantage, it silences and appeases every other Motion of Pleasure. No Joy, merely of Sense, can be a Match for it. Whoever is Judg of both the Pleasures, will ever give the Preference to the former . But to be able to judg of both, 'tis necessary to have a Sense of each. The honest Man indeed can judg of sensual Pleasure, and knows its utmost Force. For neither is his Taste, or Sense, the duller; but, on the contrary, the more intense, and clear, on the account of his Temperance, and moderate Use. But the immoral and profligate Man can by no means be allow'd a good Judg of social Pleasure , to which he is so mere a Stranger by his Nature. really present, is found to be of insufficient Force. For where it is not in its natural degree , 'tis the same indeed as if it were not , or had never been . The less there is of this good Affection in any untoward Creature, the greater the wonder is, that it shou'd at any time prevail. And if it prevails but for once , in any single Instance; it shews evidently, that if the Affection were thorowly experienc'd or known, it wou'd prevail in all. since it has the power of drawing from every other Appetite or Inclination. And thus in the Case of Love to the Offspring, and a thousand other Instances, the Charm is found to operate so strongly on the Temper, as, in the midst of other Temptations, to render it susceptible of this Passion alone; which remains as the Master-Pleasure and Conqueror of the rest.  231 come to know barely the Principles of Mathematicks , but has found, that in the exercise of his Mind on the Discoverys he there makes, tho merely of speculative Truths, he receives a Pleasure and Delight superiour to that of Sense. When we have thorowly search'd into the nature of this contemplative Delight, we shall find it of a kind which relates not in the least to any private Interest of the Creature, nor has for Object any Self-Good or Advantage of the private System. The Admiration, Joy, or Love turns wholly upon what is exteriour, and foreign to our-selves. And tho the reflected Joy or Pleasure, which arises from the notice of this Pleasure once perceiv'd, may be interpreted a Self-Passion , or interested Regard ; yet the original Satisfaction can be no other than what results from the Love of Truth, Proportion, Order, and Symmetry, in the Things without. If this be the Case, the Passion ought in reality to be rank'd with natural Affection . For having no Object within the Compass of the private System; it must either be esteem'd superfluous and unnatural (as having no Tendency towards the Advantage or Good of any thing in Nature) or it must be judg'd to be, what it truly is, "A natural Joy in the Contemplation of those Numbers , that Harmony, Proportion and Concord , which supports the universal Nature, and is essential in the Constitution and Form of every particular Species, or Order of Beings." or however superiour to any Motion of mere Sense; must yet be far surpass'd by virtuous Motion , and the Exercise of Benignity and Goodness ; where together with the most delightful Affection of the Soul, there is join'd a pleasing Assent and Approbation of the Mind to what is acted in this good Disposition and honest Bent. For where is there on Earth a fairer Matter of Speculation, a goodlier View or Contemplation, than that of a beautiful, proportion'd , and becoming Action? Or what is there relating to us, of which the Consciousness and Memory is more solidly and lastingly entertaining? together with the Affection of a vulgar sort, there is a mixture of the kind and friendly , the Sense or Feeling of this latter is in reality superiour to the former ; since often thro this Affection, and for the sake of the Person belov'd, the greatest Hardships  232 in the World have been submitted to, and even Death it-self voluntarily imbrac'd, without any expected Compensation . For where shou'd the Ground of such an Expectation lie? Not here , in this World surely; for Death puts an end to all. Nor yet hereafter , in any other . For who has ever thought of providing a Heaven or future Recompence for the suffering Virtue of Lovers? not only when Joy and Sprightliness are mixt with them, that they carry a real Enjoyment above that of the sensual kind. The very Disturbances which belong to natural Affection, tho they may be thought wholly contrary to Pleasure, yield still a Contentment and Satisfaction greater than the Pleasures of indulg'd Sense. And where a Series or continu'd Succession of the tender and kind Affections can be carry'd on, even thro Fears, Horrours, Sorrows, Griefs; the Emotion of the Soul is still agreeable. We continue pleas'd even with this melancholy Aspect or Sense of Virtue. Her Beauty supports it-self under a Cloud, and in the midst of surrounding Calamitys. For thus, when by mere Illusion, as in a Tragedy , the Passions of this kind are skilfully excited in us; we prefer the Entertainment to any other of equal duration. We find by our-selves, that the moving our Passions in this mournful way, the engaging them in behalf of Merit and Worth, and the exerting whatever we have of social Affection, and human Sympathy, is of the highest Delight, and affords a greater Enjoyment in the way of Thought and Sentiment , than any thing besides can do in a way of Sense and common Appetite . And after this manner it appears, "How much the mental Enjoyments are actually the very natural Affections themselves ." NOW, in the next place, to explain,  233 "How they proceed from them , as their natural Effects :" we may consider first, That the Effects of Love or kind Affection in a way of mental Pleasure are, " An Enjoyment of Good by Communication. A receiving it, as it were, by Reflection, or by way of Participation in the Good of others ." And " A pleasing Consciousness of the actual Love, merited Esteem or Approbation of others ." How considerable a part of Happiness arises from the former of these Effects , will be easily apprehended by one who is not exceedingly ill-natur'd. It will be consider'd how many the Pleasures are, of sharing Contentment and Delight with others ; 234 of receiving it in Fellowship and Company; and gathering it, in a manner, from the pleas'd and happy States of those around us, from accounts and relations of such Happinesses, from the very Countenances, Gestures, Voices and Sounds, even of Creatures foreign to our Kind, whose Signs of Joy and Contentment we can any way discern. So insinuating are these Pleasures of Sympathy, and so widely diffus'd thro our whole Lives, that there is hardly such a thing as Satisfaction or Contentment, of which they make not an essential part. As for that other Effect of social Love, viz. the Consciousness of merited Kindness or Esteem ; 'tis not difficult to perceive how much this avails in mental Pleasure, and constitutes the chief Enjoyment and Happiness of those who are, in the narrowest sense, voluptuous . How natural is it for the most selfish among us, to be continually drawing some sort of satisfaction from a Character, and pleasing our-selves in the Fancy of deserv'd Admiration and Esteem? For tho it be mere Fancy, we endeavour still to believe it Truth, and flatter our-selves, all we can, with the Thought of Merit of some kind, and the Persuasion of our deserving well from some few at least, with whom we happen to have a more intimate and familiar Commerce. Society, who has not a Companion, or some particular Set, either of his own Kindred, or such as he calls Friends; with whom he gladly shares his Good; in whose Welfare he delights; and whose Joy and Satisfaction he makes his own ? Who is there that receives not some Impressions from the Flattery or Kindness of such as are familiar with him? 'Tis to this soothing Hope and Expectation of Friendship, that almost all our Actions have some reference. 'Tis this that goes thro our whole Lives, and mixes it-self even with most of our Vices. Of this, Vanity, Ambition , and Luxury , have a share; and many other Disorders of our Life partake. Even the unchastest Love borrows largely from this Source. So that were Pleasure to be computed in the way that other things commonly are; it might properly be said, that out of these two Branches (viz. Community or Participation in the Pleasures of others , and Belief of meriting well from others ) wou'd arise more than nine Tenths of all that is enjoy'd in Life. And thus in the main Sum of Happiness, there is scarce a single Article, but what derives it-self from social Love, and depends immediately on the natural and kind Affections. Now such as Causes are, such must be their Effects . And therefore as natural Affection or social Love is perfect, or imperfect; so must be the Content and Happiness depending on it. 235 BUT lest any shou'd imagine with themselves that an inferiour Degree of natural Affection, or an imperfect partial Regard of this sort, can supply the place of an intire, sincere , and truly moral one; lest a small Tincture of social Inclination shou'd be thought sufficient to answer the End of Pleasure in Society, and give us that Enjoyment of Participation and Community which is so essential to our Happiness; we may consider first, That Partial Affection , or social Love in part , without regard to Society or a Whole , is in it-self an Inconsistency, and implies an absolute Contradiction. Whatever Affection we have towards any thing besides our- selves ; if it be not of the natural sort towards the System, or Kind; it must be, of all other Affection the most dissociable , and destructive of the Enjoyments of Society: If it be really of the natural sort, and apply'd only to some one Part of Society, or of a Species, but not to the Species or Society it-self ; there can be no more account given of it, than of the most odd capricious or humoursom Passion that may arise. The Person, therefore, who is conscious of this Affection, can be conscious of no Merit or Worth on the account of it. Nor can the Persons on whom this capricious Affection has chanc'd to fall, be in any manner secure of its Continuance or Force. As it has no Foundation or Establishment in Reason ; so it must be easily removable, and subject to alteration, without Reason . Now the Variableness of such sort of Passion, which depends solely on Capriciousness and Humour, and undergoes the frequent Successions of alternate Hatred and Love, Aversion and Inclination, must of necessity create continual Disturbance and Disgust, give an allay to what is immediately enjoy'd in the way of Friendship and Society, and in the end extinguish, in a manner, the very Inclination towards Friendship and human Commerce. Whereas, on the other hand, Intire Affection (from whence Integrity has its name) as it is answerable to it-self, proportionable, and rational; so it is irrefragable, solid, and durable. And as in the Case of Partiality , or vicious Friendship, which has no rule or order, every Reflection of the Mind necessarily makes to its disadvantage, and lessens the Enjoyment; so in the case of Integrity , the Consciousness of just Behaviour towards Mankind  236 in general, casts a good reflection on each friendly Affection in particular, and raises the Enjoyment of Friendship still the higher, in the way of Community or Participation above-mention'd. and slender Enjoyment of those Pleasures of Sympathy or Participation with others ; so neither is it able to derive any considerable Enjoyment from that other principal Branch of human Happiness, viz. Consciousness of the actual or merited Esteem of others . For whence shou'd this Esteem arise? The Merit surely, must in it-self be mean, whilst the Affection is so precarious and uncertain. What Trust can there be to a mere casual Inclination or capricious Liking ? Who can depend on such a Friendship as is founded on no moral Rule, but fantastically assign'd to some single Person, or small Part of Mankind, exclusive of Society, and the Whole ? or love by any other Rule than that of Virtue , shou'd place their Affection on such Subjects as they can long esteem or love. 'Twill be hard for them, in the number of their so belov'd Friends, to find any, in whom they can heartily rejoice; or whose reciprocal Love or Esteem they can sincerely prize, and enjoy. Nor can those Pleasures be sound or lasting, which are gather'd from a Self- Flattery, and false Persuasion of the Esteem and Love of others, who are incapable of any sound Esteem or Love. It appears therefore how much the Men of narrow or partial Affection must be Losers in this sense, and of necessity fall short in this second principal Part of mental Enjoyment. opposite advantages. It is equal, constant, accountable to it-self, ever satisfactory, and pleasing. It gains Applause and Love from the best ; and in all disinterested cases, from the very worst of Men. We may say of it, with justice, that it carrys with it a Consciousness of merited Love and Approbation from all Society, from all intelligent Creatures, and from whatever is Original to all other Intelligence. And if there be in Nature any such Original ; we may add, that the Satisfaction which attends Intire Affection , is full, and noble, in proportion to its final Object , which contains all Perfection; according to the Sense of Theism above-noted. For this, as has been shewn, is the result of Virtue . And to have this Nature, 238 and the Dictates and Rules of Supreme Wisdom . This is Morality, Justice, Piety, and natural Religion. and in Terms and Phrases, which are not of familiar use; we may try whether possibly we can set it yet in a plainer light. in private Retirement, Contemplation, Study, and Converse with himself ; or in Mirth, Jollity, and Entertainment, with others ; and he will find, That they are wholly founded in An easy Temper, free of Harshness, Bitterness, or Distast ; and in A Mind 239 or Reason well compos'd, quiet, easy within itself, and such as can freely bear its own Inspection and Review . Now such a Mind , and such a Temper , which fit and qualify for the Enjoyment of the Pleasures mention'd, must of necessity be owing to the natural and good Affections. As to what relates to Temper , it may be consider'd thus. There is no  240 State of outward Prosperity, or flowing Fortune, where Inclination and Desire are always satisfy'd, fancy and Humour pleas'd. There are almost hourly some Impediments or Crosses to the Appetite; some Accidents or other from without ; or something from within , to check the licentious Course of the indulg'd Affections. They are not always to be satisfy'd by mere Indulgence. And when a Life is guided by Fancy only, there is sufficient Ground of Contrariety and Disturbance. The very ordinary Lassitudes, Uneasinesses, and Defects of Disposition in the soundest Body; the interrupted Course of the Humours, or Spirits in the healthiest People; and the accidental Disorders common to every Constitution, are sufficient, we know, on many occasions to breed Uneasiness and Distast. And this, in time, must grow into a Habit; where there is nothing to oppose its progress, and hinder its prevailing on the Temper. Now the only sound Opposite to Ill Humour , is natural and kind Affection . For we may observe that when the Mind, upon reflection, resolves at any time to suppress this Disturbance already risen in the Temper, and sets about this reforming Work with heartiness, and in good earnest; it can no otherwise accomplish the Undertaking, than by introducing into the affectionate Part some gentle Feeling of the social and friendly kind; some enlivening Motion of Kindness, Fellowship, Complacency or Love, to allay and convert that contrary Motion of Impatience and Discontent.  241 sufficient and proper Remedy in this case; I answer, That 'tis according as the Kind may happily prove. For if it be of the  242 dismal sort; if it brings along with it any Affection opposite to Manhood, Generosity, Courage, and Free-Thought; there will be nothing gain'd by this Application: and the Remedy will, in the issue, be undoubtedly found worse than the Disease . The severest Reflections on our Duty , and the Consideration merely of what is by Authority and under Penaltys enjoin'd, will not by any means serve to calm us on this occasion. The more dismal our Thoughts are on such a Subject; the worse our Temper will be, and the readier to discover it-self in Harshness, and Austerity. If, perhaps, thro Policy, or by any Necessity or Fear, a different Carriage be at any time affected, or different Maxims own'd; the Practice at the bottom will be the same. If the Countenance be compos'd; the Heart , however, will not be chang'd. The ill Passion may for the time be withheld from breaking into Action; but will not be subdu'd, or in the least debilitated against the next occasion. So that in such a Breast as this, whatever Devotion there may be; 'tis likely there will in time be little of an easy Spirit , or good Temper remaining; and consequently but few and slender Enjoyments of a mental kind. Prosperity and in the height of Fortune, there can nothing probably occur which shou'd thus sour the Temper , and give it such disrelish as is suggested; we may consider, that the most humour'd and indulg'd State is apt to receive the most disturbance from every Disappointment or smallest Ail. And if Provocations are easiest rais'd, and the Passions of Anger, Offence, and Enmity are found the highest in the most indulg'd State of Will and Humour; there is still the greater need of a Supply from social Affection , to preserve the Temper from running into Savageness and Inhumanity. NOW as to the other part of our Consideration,  243 and what relates to a Mind or Reason well compos'd and easy within it- self ; upon what account this Happiness may be thought owing to natural Affection , we may possibly resolve our-selves, after this manner. It will be acknowledg'd that a Creature, such as Man, who from several degrees of Reflection has risen to that Capacity which we call Reason and  244 Understanding; must in the very use of this his reasoning Faculty, be forc'd to receive Reflections back into his Mind of what passes in it-self, and in the Affections, or Will; in short, of whatsoever relates to his Character, Conduct, or Behaviour towards his Fellow-Creatures, and Society. Or shou'd he be of himself unapt; there are others ready to remind him, and refresh his Memory, in this way of Criticism. We have all of us Remembrancers enow to help us in this Work. Nor are the greatest Favourites of Fortune exempted from this Task of Self-Inspection. Even Flattery it-self, by making the View agreeable, renders us more attentive this way, and insnares us in the Habit. The vainer any Person is, the more he has his Eye inwardly fix'd upon himself; and is, after a certain manner, employ'd in this home-Survey. And when a true Regard to our-selves cannot oblige us to this Inspection, a false Regard to others, and a Fondness for Reputation furnishes us sufficiently with Acts of Reflection on our own Character and Conduct. reasoning or reflecting Creature is, by his Nature, forc'd to endure the Review of his own Mind, and Actions; and to have Representations of himself, and his inward Affairs, constantly passing before him, obvious to him, and revolving in his Mind. Now as nothing can be more grievous than this is, to one who has thrown off natural Affection ; so nothing can be more delightful to one who has preserv'd it with sincerity. a rational Creature must be horridly offensive and grievous; viz. "To have the Reflection in his Mind of any unjust Action or Behaviour, which he knows to be odious and ill-deserving :" Or, of any foolish Action or Behaviour, prejudicial to his own Interest or Happiness ." call'd Conscience ; whether in a moral, or religious sense. For to have Awe and Terrour of the Deity, does not, of it-self, imply Conscience. No one is esteem'd the more conscientious for the fear of evil Spirits, Conjurations, Enchantments, or whatever may proceed from any unjust, capricious, or devilish Nature. Now to fear God any otherwise than as in consequence of some justly blamable and imputable Act, is to fear a devilish Nature; not a divine one. Nor does the Fear of Hell, or a thousand Terrors of the imply Conscience; unless where there is an Apprehension of what is wrong, odious, 247 morally deform'd , and ill-deserving . And where this is the Case, there Conscience must have effect, and Punishment of necessity be apprehended; even tho it be not expresly threaten'd. And tho the former be understood to carry with it the Fear of divine Punishment; it has its force however from the apprehended moral Deformity and Odiousness of any Act, with respect purely to the Divine Presence, and the natural Veneration due to such a suppos'd Being. For in such a Presence, the Shame of Villany or Vice must have its force, independently on that further Apprehension of the magisterial Capacity of such a Being, and his Dispensation of particular Rewards or Punishments in a future State. intentionally does ill , but is sensible, at the same time, that he deserves ill . And in this respect, every sensible Creature may be said to have Conscience . For with all Mankind, and all intelligent Creatures, this must ever hold, "That what they know they deserve from every one, that they necessarily must fear and expect from All." And thus Suspicions and ill Apprehensions must arise, with Terrors both of Men and of the Deity . But besides this, there must in every rational Creature, be yet farther Conscience; viz. From Sense of Deformity in what is thus ill-deserving and unnatural : and from the consequent Regret of incurring what is odious, and moves Aversion. as such merely , does not at all offend; nor any thing opprobrious or heinously imputable, move, or affect. If there be such a one; 'tis evident he must be absolutely indifferent towards moral Good or Ill. If this indeed be his Case; 'twill be allow'd he can be no way capable of natural Affection: If not of that; then neither of any social Pleasure, or mental Enjoyment, as shewn above; but on the contrary, he must be subject to all manner of horrid, unnatural, and ill Affection. So that to want Conscience , Or natural Sense of the Odiousness of Crime and Injustice , is to be most of all miserable in Life: but where Conscience , or Sense of this sort, remains; there, consequently, whatever is committed against it, must of necessity, by means of Reflection, as we have shewn, be continually grievous and offensive. kill his Companion, relents immediately on the sight of what he has done. His Revenge is chang'd into Pity, and his Hatred turn'd against himself. And this merely by the Power of the Object. On this account he suffers Agonys; the Subject of this continually occurs to him; and of this he has a constant ill Remembrance and displeasing Consciousness. If on the other side, we suppose him not to relent or suffer any real Concern; then, either he has no Sense of the Deformity of Crime and Injustice, no natural Affection, and consequently no Happiness or Peace within: or if he has any Sense of moral Worth or Goodness, it must be of a perplex'd, and contrary kind. He must pursue an inconsistent Notion, idolize  249 some false Species of Virtue, and affect as noble, gallant, or worthy, that which is irrational and absurd. And how tormenting this must be to him, is easy to conceive. For never can such a Phantom as this, be reduc'd to any certain Form. Never can this Proteus of Honour be held steddy, to one Shape. The pursuit of it can only be vexatious and distracting. There is nothing but real Virtue (as has been shewn) which can possibly hold any proportion to Esteem, Approbation, or good Conscience. And he who, being led by false Religion or prevailing Custom, has learnt to esteem or admire any thing as Virtue which is not really such; must either thro the Inconsistency of such an Esteem, and the perpetual Immoralitys occasion'd by it, come at last to lose all Conscience, and so be miserable in the worst way: or, if he retains any Conscience at all, it must be of a kind never satisfactory, or able to bestow Content. For 'tis impossible that a cruel Enthusiast, or Bigot, a Persecutor, a Murderer, a Bravo , a Pirate, or any Villain of less degree, who is false to the Society of Mankind in general, and contradicts natural Affection, shou'd have any fix'd Principle at all, any real Standard or Measure by which he can regulate his Esteem, or any solid Reason for his Approbation of any one moral Act. And thus the more he sets up Honour , or advances Zeal ; the worse he makes his Nature, and the more detestable his Character. The more he engages in the Love or Admiration of any Action or Practice, as great and glorious, which is in it-self morally ill and vicious; the more Contradiction and Self-disapprobation he must incur. For there being nothing more certain than this, "That no natural Affection can be contradicted, nor no unnatural one advanc'd, without a prejudice in some degree "gree to all natural Affection in general:" it must follow, "That inward  250 Deformity growing greater, by the Incouragement of unnatural Affection; there must be so much the more Subject for dissatisfactory Reflection, the more any false Principle of Honour, any false Religion, or Superstition prevails." So that whatever Notions of this kind are cherish'd; or whatever Character affected, which is contrary to moral Equity, and leads to Inhumanity, thro a false Conscience , or wrong Sense of Honour , serves only to bring a Man the more under the  251 Lash of real and just Conscience , Shame and Self-Reproach. Nor can any one who, by any pretended Authority, commits one single Immorality, be able to satisfy himself with any Reason, why he shou'd not at another time be carry'd further, into all manner of Villany; such perhaps as he even abhors to think of. And this is a Reproach which a Mind must of necessity make to it-self upon the least Violation of natural Conscience; in doing what is morally deform'd and ill-deserving ; tho warranted by any Example or Precedent amongst Men, or by any suppos'd Injunction or Command of higher Powers. Now as for that other part of Conscience, viz. the remembrance of what 252 was at any time unreasonably done, and in prejudice of one's real Interest or Happiness : This dissatisfactory Reflection must follow still and have effect, wheresoever there is a Sense of moral Deformity, contracted by Crime, and Injustice. For even where there is no Sense of moral Deformity, as such merely ; there must be still a Sense of the ill Merit of it with respect to God and Man. Or tho there were a possibility of excluding for ever all Thoughts or Suspicions of any superiour Powers, yet considering that this Insensibility towards moral Good or Ill implies a total Defect in natural Affection, and that this Defect can by no Dissimulation be conceal'd; 'tis evident that a Man of this unhappy Character must suffer a very sensible Loss in the Friendship, Trust, and Confidence of other Men; and consequently must suffer in his Interest and outward Happiness. Nor can the Sense of this Disadvantage fail to occur to him; when he sees, with Regret, and Envy, the better and more grateful Terms of Friendship, and Esteem, on which better People live with the rest of Mankind. Even therefore where natural Affection is wanting; 'tis certain still, that by Immorality, necessarily happening thro want of such Affection, there must be disturbance from Conscience of this sort, viz. from Sense of what is committed imprudently, and contrary to real Interest and Advantage. how much our Happiness depends on natural and good Affection . For if the chief Happiness be from the Mental Pleasures ; and the chief mental Pleasures are such as we have describ'd, and are founded in natural Affection ; it follows, "That to have the natural Affections, is to have the chief Means and Power of Self-Enjoyment, the highest Possession and Happiness of Life ." and the Satisfactions belonging to mere Sense ; 'tis evident, they cannot  255 possibly have their Effect, or afford any valuable Enjoyment, but by the means of social and natural Affection. To live well , has no other meaning  256 with some People, than to eat and drink well . And methinks 'tis but an unwary Concession we make in favour of these pretended good Livers , when we join with 'em, in honouring their way of Life with the Title of living fast . As if they liv'd the fastest who took the greatest Pains to enjoy least of Life: For if our Account of Happiness be right; the greatest Enjoyments  257 in Life are such as these Men pass over in their haste, and have scarce ever allow'd themselves the Liberty to taste. ; and as notable as the Science is, which depends on it; one may justly presume that the  258 Ostentation of Elegance, and a certain Emulation and Study how to excel in this sumptuous Art of Living, goes very far in the raising such a high Idea of it, as is observ'd among the Men of Pleasure. For were the Circumstances of a Table and Company, Equipages, Services, and the rest of the Management withdrawn; there wou'd be hardly left any Pleasure worth acceptance, even in the Opinion of the most Debauch'd themselves. is a Sally into all that can be imagin'd of Pleasure and Voluptuousness) carries with it a plain reference to Society, or Fellowship. It may be call'd a Surfeit , or Excess of Eating and Drinking , but hardly a Debauch of that kind, when the Excess is committed separately, out of all Society, or Fellowship. And one who abuses himself in this way, is often call'd a Sot , but never a Debauchee . The Courtizans, and even the commonest of Women, who live  260 by Prostitution, know very well how necessary it is, that every one whom they 261 entertain with their Beauty, shou'd believe that there are Satisfactions reciprocal; and that Pleasures are no less given than receiv'd . And were this Imagination to be wholly taken away, there wou'd be hardly any of the grosser sort of Mankind, who wou'd not perceive their remaining Pleasure to be of slender Estimation. abstracted perfectly, even in his very Mind and Thought, from every thing belonging to Society? Who is there that on these Terms wou'd not presently be cloy'd by any sensual Indulgence? Who is there that wou'd not soon grow uneasy with his Pleasure, however exquisite, till such time as he had found means to impart it, and make it truly pleasant to him, by communicating, and sharing it at least with some one single Person? Let Men imagine what they please; let 'em suppose themselves ever so selfish; or desire ever so much to follow the Dictates of that narrow Principle, by which they wou'd bring Nature under restraint: Nature will break out; and in Agonys, Disquiets, and a distemper'd State, demonstrate evidently the ill Consequence of such Violence, the Absurdity of such a Device, and the Punishment which belongs to such a monstrous and horrid Endeavour. of the Mind , but even those of the Body depend on natural Affection: insomuch that where this is wanting, they not only lose their Force, but are in a manner converted into Uneasiness and Disgust. The Sensations which shou'd 263 naturally afford Contentment and Delight, produce rather Discontent and Sourness, and breed a Wearisomness and Restlesness in the Disposition. This we may perceive by the perpetual Inconstancy, and Love of Change, so remarkable in those who have nothing communicative or friendly in their Pleasures. Good Fellowship ,  264 in its abus'd Sense, seems indeed to have something in it more constant and determining. The Company supports the Humour. 'Tis the same in Love . A  265 certain Tenderness and Generosity of Affection supports the Passion, which otherwise wou'd instantly be chang'd. The perfectest Beauty cannot, of it- self, retain, or fix it. And that Love which has no other Foundation, but relies on this exterior kind, is soon turn'd into Aversion. Satiety, perpetual Disgust, and Feverishness of Desire, attend those who passionately study Pleasure. They best  266 enjoy it, who study to regulate their Passions. And by this they will come to know how absolute an Incapacity there is in any thing sensual to please, or give Contentment, where it depends not on something friendly or social, something conjoin'd, and in Affinity with kind or natural Affection. BUT e'er we conclude this Article of  267 social or natural Affection , we may take a general View of it, and bring it, once for all, into the Scale; to prove what kind of  268 its Deficiency , or light Weight. Constitution, but knows that without Action, Motion, and Employment, the Body languishes, and is oppress'd; its Nourishment turns to Disease; the Spirits, unimploy'd abroad, help to consume the Parts within; and Nature, as it were, preys upon her-self. In the same manner, the sensible and living Part, the Soul or Mind , wanting its proper and natural Exercise, is burden'd and diseas'd. Its Thoughts and Passions being unnaturally withheld from their due Objects, turn  269 against it- self, and create the highest Impatience and ill Humour. Brutes , and other Creatures, who have not the use of Reason or Reflection (at least not after the manner of Man-kind)  271 'tis so order'd in Nature, that by their daily search after Food, and their Application either towards the Business of their Livelihood, or the Affairs of their Species or Kind, almost their whole time is taken up, and they fail not to find full Imployment for their Passion, according to that degree of Agitation to which they are fitted, and which their Constitution requires. If any one of these Creatures be taken out of his natural laborious State, and plac'd amidst such a Plenty as can profusely administer to all his Appetites and Wants; it may be observ'd, that as his Circumstances grow thus luxuriant, his Temper and Passions have the same Growth. When he comes, at any time, to have the Accommodations of Life at a cheaper and easier rate than was at first intended him by Nature, he is made to pay dear for 'em in another way; by losing his natural good Disposition, and the Orderliness of his Kind or Species.  272 least Knowledg of Natural History, or has been an Observer of the several Breeds of Creatures, and their ways of Life, and Propagation, will easily understand this Difference of Orderliness between the Wild and the Tame of the same Species. The latter acquire new Habits; and deviate from their original Nature. They lose even the common Instinct and ordinary Ingenuity of their Kind; nor  273 can they ever regain it, whilst they continue in this pamper'd State: But being turn'd to shift abroad, they resume the natural Affection and Sagacity of their Species. They learn to unite in stricter Fellowship; and grow more concern'd for their Offspring. They provide against the Seasons, and make the most of every Advantage given by Nature for the Support and Maintenance of their particular Species, against such as are foreign and hostile. And thus as they grow busy and imploy'd, they grow regular and good. Their Petulancy and Vice forsakes them with their Idleness and Ease. some are by necessity consin'd to Labour, others are provided with abundance of all things, by the Pains, and Labour of Inferiours. Now, if among the superiour and easy sort, there be not something of fit and proper Imployment rais'd in the room of what is wanting in common Labour and Toil; if instead of an Application to any sort of Work, such as has a good and honest end in Society (as Letters, Sciences, Arts, Husbandry, publick Affairs, Oeconomy, or the like) there be a thorow Neglect of all Duty or Imployment; a settled Idleness, Supineness and Inactivity; this of necessity must occasion a most relax'd and dissolute State: It must produce a total Disorder of the Passions, and break out in the strangest Irregularitys imaginable. long the Seat of Empire. We see what Improvements are made in Vice of every kind, where numbers of Men are maintain'd in lazy Opulence, and wanton Plenty. 'Tis otherwise with those who are taken up in honest and due Imployment, and have been well inur'd to it from their Youth. This we may observe in the hardy remote Provincials, the Inhabitants of smaller Towns, and the industrious sort of common People; where 'tis rare to meet with any Instances of those Irregularitys, which are known in Courts and Palaces, and in the rich Foundations  275 of easy and pamper'd Priests. and just; if it be true that Nature works by a just Order and Regulation as well in the Passions and Affections, as in the Limbs and Organs which she forms; if it appears withal, that she has so constituted this inward Part , that nothing is so essential to it as Exercise ; and no Exercise so essential as that of social or natural Affection ; it follows that where this is remov'd or weaken'd, the inward Part must necessarily suffer and be impair'd. Let Indolence, Indifference, or Insensibility, be study'd as an Art, or cultivated with the utmost Care; the Passions thus restrain'd will force their Prison, and in one way or another procure their Liberty, and find full Employment. They will be sure to create to themselves unusual and unnatural Exercise, where they are cut off from such as is natural and good . And thus in the room of orderly and natural Affection, new and unnatural must be rais'd, and all inward Order and Oeconomy destroy'd. 276 Formation and Structure of Animals, to imagine that so great a Principle , so fundamental a Part as that of natural Affection shou'd possibly be lost or impair'd, without any inward Ruin or Subversion of the Temper and Frame of Mind. the inward Fabrick so adjusted, and the whole 277 so nicely built; that the barely extending of a single Passion a little too far, or the continuance of it too long, is able to bring irrecoverable Ruin and Misery. He will find this experienc'd in the ordinary Case of Phrenzy, and Distraction; when the Mind, dwelling too long upon one Subject (whether prosperous or calamitous) sinks under the weight of it, and proves what the necessity is, of a due Ballance , and Counterpoise in the Affections. He will find, that in every different Creature, and distinct Sex, there is a different and distinct Order, Set , or Suit of Passions; proportionable to the different Order of Life, the different Functions, and Capacitys assign'd to each. As the Operations and Effects are different, so are the Springs and Causes in each System. The inside Work is fitted to the outward Action and Performance. So that where Habits or Affections are dislodg'd, misplac'd or chang'd; where those belonging to one Species are intermixt with those belonging to another, there must of necessity be Confusion and Disturbance within.  278 imperfect  279 Natures, such as are imperfect from their Birth, by having suffer'd Violence within , in their earliest Form , and inmost Matrix . We know how it is with Monsters , such as are compounded of different Kinds, or different Sexes. Nor are they less Monsters , who are mishapen or distorted in an inward Part. The ordinary Animals appear unnatural and monstrous, when they lose their proper Instincts, forsake their Kind, neglect their Offspring, and pervert those Functions or Capacitys bestow'd by Nature. How wretched must it be, therefore, for Man , of all other Creatures, to lose that Sense , and Feeling , which is proper to him as a Man , and sutable to his character, and Genius? How unfortunate must it be for a Creature, whose dependence on Society is greater than any others, to lose that natural Affection by which he is prompted to the Good and Interest of his Species, and Community? Such indeed is Man's natural Share of this Affection , that He , of all other Creatures, is plainly the least able to bear solitude. Nor is any thing more apparent than that there is naturally in every Man such a degree of social Affection as inclines him to seek the Familiarity and Friendship of his Fellows. 'Tis here that he lets loose a Passion, and gives reins to a Desire which can hardly by any struggle or inward violence be with- held; or if it be, is sure to create a Sadness, Dejection, and Melancholy in the Mind. For whoever is unsociable, and voluntarily shuns Society, or Commerce with the World, must of necessity be morose and ill-natur'd. He, on the other side, who is with-held by force or accident, finds in his Temper the ill Effects of this Restraint. The Inclination, when suppress'd, breeds Discontent; and on the contrary affords a healing and enlivening Joy, when acting at its liberty, and with full scope: as we may see particularly, when after a time of Solitude and long Absence, the Heart is open'd, the Mind disburden'd, and the Secrets of the Breast unfolded to a Bosom-Friend. Stations; even in Princes, Monarchs, and those who seem by their Condition to be above ordinary human Commerce, and who affect a sort of distant Strangeness from the rest of Mankind. But their Carriage is not the same towards all Men. The wiser and better sort, it's true, are often held at a distance; as unfit for their Intimacy, or secret Trust. But to 280 compensate this, there are others substituted in the room, who tho they have the least Merit, and are perhaps the most vile and contemptible of Men, are sufficient, however, to serve the purpose of an imaginary Friendship, and can become Favourites in form. These are the Subjects of Humanity in the Great . For These we see them often in concern and pain: in These they easily confide: to These they can with pleasure communicate their Power and Greatness, be open, free, generous, confiding, bountiful; as rejoicing in the Action it-self: having no Intention or Aim beyond it; and their Interest, in respect of Policy, often standing a quite contrary way. But where neither the Love of Mankind, nor the Passion for Favourites prevails, the Tyrannical Temper fails not to shew it-self in its proper Colours, and to the Life, with all the Bitterness, Cruelty, and Mistrust, which belongs to that solitary and gloomy State of un-communicative and un-friendly Greatness. Nor needs there any particular Proof from History or present Time to second this Remark. how it is inwardly join'd to us, and implanted in our Natures; how interwoven with our other Passions; and how essential to that regular Motion and Course of our Affections, on which our Happiness and Self-Enjoyment so immediately depend. Natural and Good Affections, is to have The Chief Means and Power of Self- Enjoyment: So on the other side , To want them, is certain Misery, and Ill. " The Self-Passions Too Intense Or Strong, A Creature Becomes Miserable. Affections, which relate to the private Interest or separate Oeconomy of the Creature: such as Love of Life;---Resentment of Injury;---Pleasure, or Appetite towards Nourisbment and the Means of Generation; ---Interest, or Desire of those Conveniences , by which we are well provided for , and maintain'd;--- Emulation , or Love of Praise and Honour;---Indolence , or Love of Ease and Rest .--- These are the Affections  282 which relate to the private System, and constitute whatever we call Interestedness or Self-Love. neither injurious to social Life, nor a hinderance to Virtue: but being in an extreme degree, they become Cowardice,--- Revengefulness,---Luxury,--- Avarice,---Vanity and Ambition,---Sloth;--- and, as such, are own'd vicious and ill, with respect to human Society. How they are ill also with respect to the private Person, and are to his own disadvantage as well as that of the Publick, we may consider, as we severally examine them. IF there were any of these Self-Passions,  283 which for the Good and Happiness of the Creature might be oppos'd to Natural Affection , and allow'd to over-ballance it; the Desire and Love of Life wou'd have the best Pretence. But it will be found perhaps that there is no Passion which, by having much allow'd to it, is the occasion of more Disorder and Misery. Life may sometimes be even a Misfortune and Misery." To inforce the continuance of it in Creatures reduc'd to such Extremity, is esteem'd the greatest Cruelty. And tho Religion forbids that any one shou'd be his own Reliever; yet if by some fortunate accident, Death offers of it-self , it is embrac'd as highly welcome. And on this account the nearest Friends and Relations often rejoice at the Release of one entirely belov'd; even tho he himself may have been so weak as earnestly to decline Death, and endeavour the utmost Prolongment of his own uneligible State. and since it naturally becomes so, by being only prolong'd to the Infirmitys of Old Age; since there is nothing, withal, more common than to see Life over- valu'd, and purchas'd at such a Cost as it can never justly be thought worth; it follows evidently, that the Passion it-self (viz. the Love of Life , and Abhorrence or Dread of Death ) if beyond a certain degree, and over- ballancing in the Temper of any Creature, must lead him directly against his own Interest; make him, upon occasion, become the greatest Enemy to himself; and necessitate him to act as such.  284 Courses and Means whatsoever, in any Circumstances, or at any rate, to preserve Life ; yet wou'd it be against his Interest still to have this Passion in a high degree. For it wou'd by this means prove ineffectual, and no way conducing to its end. Various Instances need not be given. For what is there better known, than that at all times an excessive Fear betrays to danger, instead of saving from it? 'Tis impossible for any one to act sensibly, and with Presence of Mind, even in his own Preservation and Defence, when he is strongly press'd by such a Passion. On all extraordinary Emergences, 'tis Courage and Resolution saves; whilst Cowardice robs us of the means of Safety, and not only deprives us of our defensive Facultys, but even runs us to the brink of Ruin, and makes us meet that Evil which of it-self wou'd never have invaded us. represented; it must be allow'd still that in it-self it can be no other than miserable; if it be Misery to feel Cowardice, and be haunted by those Specters and Horrors which are proper to the Character of one who has a thorow Dread of Death. For 'tis not only when Dangers happen, and Hazards are incurr'd, that this sort of Fear oppresses and distracts. If it but once prevails, it gives no quarter, so much as at the safest stillest hour of Retreat and Quiet. Every Object suggests Thought enough to employ it. It operates when it is least observ'd by others; and enters at all times into the pleasantest parts of Life; so as to corrupt and poison all Enjoyment, and Content. One may safely aver, that by reason of this Passion alone, many a Life, if inwardly and closely view'd, wou'd be found to be thorowly miserable, tho attended with all other Circumstances that in appearance render it happy. But when we add to this, the Meannesses, and base Condescensions, occasion'd by such a passionate Concern for Living; when we consider how by means of it, we are driven to Actions which we can never view but with Dislike, and forc'd by degrees from our natural Conduct, into still greater Crookednesses and Perplexity; there is no one (I think) so disingenuous as not to allow, that Life , in this case, becomes a sorry Purchase, and is pass'd with little Freedom or Satisfaction. For how can this be otherwise, whilst all that is generous and worthy, even the chief Relish, Happiness , and Good of Life, is for Life's sake abandon'd and renounc'd?  285 Interest of a Creature, and contrary to his Happiness and Good ." THERE is another Passion very different  286 from that of Fear , and which in a certain degree is equally preservative to us, and conducing to our Safety. As that is serviceable, in prompting us to shun Danger; so is this , in fortifying us against it, and enabling us to repel Injury, and resist Violence when offer'd. 'Tis true that according to strict Virtue, and a just Regulation of the Affections in a wise and virtuous Man, such Efforts towards Action amount not to what is justly stil'd Passion or Commotion . A Man of Courage may be cautious without real Fear . And a Man of Temper may resist or punish without Anger . But in ordinary Characters there must necessarily be some Mixture of the real Passions themselves; which however, in the main, are able to allay and temper one another. And thus Anger in a manner becomes necessary. 'Tis by this Passion that one Creature offering Violence to another, is deter'd from the Execution; whilst he observes how the Attempt affects his Fellow; and knows by the very Signs which accompany this rising Motion, that if the Injury be carry'd further, it will not pass easily, or with impunity. 'Tis this Passion withal, which after Violence and Hostility executed, rouzes a Creature in opposition, and assists him in returning like Hostility and Harm on the Invader. For thus, as Rage and Despair increase, a Creature grows still more terrible; and being urg'd to the greatest extremity, finds a degree of Strength and Boldness unexperienc'd till then, and which had never risen but thro the height of Provocation. As to this Affection therefore, tho its immediate Aim be indeed the Ill or Punishment of another , yet it is plainly of the sort of those which tend to the Advantage and Interest of the Self-System, the Animal himself ; and is withal in other respects contributing to the Good and Interest of the Species. But there is hardly need we shou'd explain how mischievous and self-destructive Anger is, if it be what we commonly understand by that word: if it be such a Passion as is rash, and violent in the instant of Provocation; or such as imprints it-self deeply, and causes a settled Revenge , and an eager vindicative Pursuit. No wonder indeed that so much is done in mere Revenge , and under the Weight of a deep Resentment , when the Relief and Satisfaction  287 found in that Indulgence is no other than the assuaging of the most torturous Pain, and the alleviating the most weighty and pressing Sensation of Misery. The Pain of this sort being for a while remov'd or alleviated by the accomplishment of the Desire, in the Ill of another, leaves indeed behind it the perception of a delicious Ease, and an overflowing of soft and pleasing Sensation. Yet is this, in truth, no better than the Rack it-self. For whoever has experienc'd racking Pains, can tell in what manner a sudden Cessation or Respite is us'd to affect him. From hence are those untoward Delights of Perverseness, Frowardness, and an envenom'd malignant Disposition, acting at its liberty. For this is only A perpetual assuaging of Anger perpetually renew'd . In other Characters, the Passion arises not so suddenly, or on slight Causes; but being once mov'd, is not so easily quieted. The dormant Fury , Revenge , being rais'd once to her highest pitch, rests not till she attains her End; and, that attain'd, is easy, and reposes; making our succeeding Relief and Ease so much the more enjoy'd, as our preceding Anguish and incumbent Pain was of long duration, and bitter sense. Certainly if among Lovers , and in the Language of Gallantry, the Success of ardent Love is call'd the assuaging of a Pain ; this other Success may be far more justly term'd so. However soft or flattering the former Pain may be esteem'd, this latter surely can be no pleasing one : Nor can it be possibly esteem'd other than sound and thorow Wretchedness, a grating and disgustful Feeling, without the least mixture of any thing soft, gentle, or agreeable. respect of our Minds , or Bodys , our private Condition or Circumstances of Life. These are of the moral sort of Subjects, join'd commonly with Religion, and often treated in publick, to the general Satiety of Mankind, entertain'd more than sufficiently with the Rhetorick of this Authoritative kind. What has been said, may be enough perhaps to make this evident, "That to be subject to such a Passion as we have been mentioning, is, in reality, to be very unhappy.". And, "That the Habit of it, is a Disease , of the worst sort; from which Misery is inseparable." World calls Pleasure : Were it true (as has been prov'd the contrary) that the most considerable Enjoyments were those merely of the Sense ; and were it true, withal, that those Enjoyments of the 289 Sense lay in certain outward things capable of yielding always a due and certain Portion of Pleasure, according to their degree and quality; it wou'd then follow, that the certain way to obtain Happiness, wou'd be to procure largely of these Subjects, to which Happiness and Pleasure were thus infallibly annex'd. But however fashionably we may apply the Notion of good Living , 'twill hardly be found that our inward Facultys are able to keep pace with these outward Supplys of a Iuxuriant Fortune. And if the natural Disposition and Aptness from within be not concurring; 'twill be in vain that these Subjects are thus multiply'd from abroad , and acquir'd with ever so great facility. Nauseating and Distaste, that they have nevertheless as constant a Craving or Eagerness of Stomach. But the Appetite of this kind is false and unnatural ; as is that of Thirst arising from a Fever, or contracted by habitual Debauch. Now the Satisfactions of the natural Appetite , in a plain way, are infinitely beyond those Indulgences of the most refin'd and elegant Luxury . This is often perceiv'd by the Luxurious themselves. It has been experienc'd in People bred after the sumptuous way, and us'd never to wait, but to prevent Appetite; that when by any new Turn of Life they came to fall into a more natural Course, or for a while, as on a Journy, or a day of Sport, came accidentally to experience the Sweet of a plain Diet, recommended by due Abstinence and Exercise; they have with freedom own'd, that it was then they receiv'd the highest Satisfaction and Delight which a Table cou'd possibly afford. an active Life, and healthful Exercise; that having once thorowly experienc'd this plainer and more natural Diet, they have upon a following Change of Life regretted their Loss, and undervalu'd the Pleasures receiv'd from all the Delicacys of Luxury , in comparison with those remember'd Satisfactions of a preceding State. 'Tis plain, that by urging Nature, forcing the Appetite, and inciting Sense, the Keenness of the natural Sensations is lost. And tho thro Vice or ill Habit the same Subjects of Appetite may, every day, be sought with greater Ardour; they are enjoy'd with less Satisfaction. Tho the Impatience of abstaining be greater; the Pleasure of Indulgence is really less. The Palls or Nauseatings which continually intervene, are of the worst and most hateful kind of Sensation. Hardly is there any thing tasted which is wholly free  290 from this ill relish of a surfeited Sense and ruin'd Appetite. So that instead of a constant and flowing Delight afforded in such a State of Life, the very State it-self is in reality a Sickness and Infirmity, a Corruption of Pleasure, and destructive of every natural and agreeable Sensation. So far is it from being true; "That in this licentious Course we enjoy Life best , or are likely to make the most of it." Diseases of many kinds, and to the Mind , by Sottishness and Stupidity; this needs not any explanation. impotent and unrestrain'd Desire, as it increases our Wants, so it must subject us to a greater Dependence on others. Our private Circumstances, however plentiful or easy they may be, can less easily content us. Ways and Means must be invented to procure what may administer to such an imperious Luxury , as forces us to sacrifice Honour to Fortune, and runs us out into all irregularity and extravagance of Conduct. The Injurys we do our-selves, by Excess and Unforbearance, are then surely apparent, when thro an Impotence of this sort, and an Impossibility of Restraint, we do what we our-selves declare to be  291 destructive to us. But these are Matters obvious of themselves. And from less than what has been said, tis easy to conclude, "That Luxury, Riot , and Debauch , are contrary to real Interest, and to the true Enjoyment of Life." THERE is another Luxury superiour  292 to the kind we have been mentioning, and which in strictness can scarce be call'd a Self-Passion , since the sole End of it is the advantage and promotion of the Species. But whereas all other social Affections are join'd only with a mental Pleasure , and founded in mere Kindness and Love; this has more added to it, and is join'd with a Pleasure of Sense . Such Concern and Care has Nature shewn for the Support and Maintenance of the several Species, that by a certain Indigence and kind of Necessity of their Natures, they are made to regard the Propagation of their Kind. Now whether it be the Interest or Good of the Animal to feel this Indigence beyond a natural and ordinary degree; is what we may consider. there needs less to be said on this occasion. If it be allow'd, that to all other  293 Pleasures there is a Measure of Appetite belonging, which cannot possibly be exceeded without prejudice to the Creature, even in his very Capacity of enjoying Pleasure; it will hardly be thought that there is no certain Limit or just Boundary of this other Appetite of the AMOROUS kind . There are other sorts of ardent Sensations accidentally experienc'd, which we find pleasant and acceptable whilst they are held within a certain degree; but which as they increase, grow oppressive and intolerable. Laughter provok'd by Titillation, grows an excessive Pain; tho it retains still the same Features of Delight and Pleasure. And tho in the case of that particular kind of Itch which belongs to a Distemper nam'd from that effect, there are some who far from disliking the Sensation, find it highly acceptable and delightful; yet it will hardly be reputed such amongst the more refin'd sort, even of those who make Pleasure their chief Study, and highest Good. Degree of Ardour, which by being further advanc'd, comes the nearer to mere Rage and Fury; if there be indeed a necessity of stopping somewhere , and determining on some Boundary for the Passion; where can we fix our Standard, or how regulate our-selves but with regard to Nature , beyond which there is no Measure or Rule of things? Now Nature may be known from what we see of the natural State of Creatures, and of Man himself, when unprejudic'd by vicious Education. and Sobriety, and un-accustom'd to any thing immoderate or intemperate; he is found to have his Desires and Inclinations of this sort at command. Nor are they on this account less able to afford him the Pleasure or Enjoyment of the kind. On the contrary; as they are more vigorous, healthy, and un-injur'd by Excess and Abuse, they must afford him proportionate Satisfaction. So that were both these Sensations to be experimentally compar'd; that of a virtuous Course which belong'd to one who liv'd a natural and regular Life, and that of a vicious Course which belong'd to one who was relax'd and dissolute; there is no question but Judgment wou'd be given in favour of the former, without regard to Consequences, and only with respect to the very Pleasure of Sense it-self. with respect to the Health and Vigour of the Body ; there is no need to mention any thing. The Injury it does the Mind , tho less notic'd, is yet greater. The Hinderance of all Improvement, the wretched Waste of Time, the Effeminacy, Sloth, Supineness, the Disorder and Looseness of a thousand Passions, thro such a relaxation and enervating of the Mind; are all of them Effects sufficiently apparent, when reflected on. Society, and the World; and what the Advantages are of a contrary Sobriety, and Self-Command, wou'd be to little purpose to mention. 'Tis well known there can be no Slavery greater than what is consequent to the Dominion and Rule of such a Passion. Of all other, it is the least manageable by Favour or Concession, and assumes the most from Privilege and Indulgence. What it costs us in the Modesty and Ingenuity of our Natures, and in the Faith and Honesty of our Characters, is as easily apprehended by any one who will reflect. And it will from hence appear, "That there is no Passion, which in its Extravagance and Excess more necessarily occasions Disorder and Unhappiness." peculiarly interesting ; as having for its Aim the Possession of Wealth, and what we call a Settlement or Fortane in the World: If the Regard towards this kind be moderate, and in a reasonable degree; if it occasion no passionate Pursuit, nor raises any ardent Desire or Appetite, there is nothing in this Case but what is compatible with Virtue, and even sutable and beneficial to Society. The publick as well as private System is advanc'd by the Industry, which this Affection excites. But if it grows at length into a real Passion ; the Injury and Mischief it does the Publick, is not greater than that which it creates to the Person himself. Such a one is in reality a Self-Oppressor, and lies heavier on himself than he can ever do on Mankind. think, be explain'd. Who is there that knows not how small a Portion of worldly Matters is sufficient for a Man's single Use and Convenience; and how much his Occasions and Wants might be contracted and reduc'd, if a just Frugality were study'd, and Temperance and a natural Life came once to be pursu'd with 296 half that Application, Industry and Art which is bestow'd on Sumptuousness and Luxury? Now if Temperance be in reality so advantageous, and the Practice as well as the Consequences of it so pleasing and happy, as has been before express'd; there is little need, on the other side, to mention any thing of the Miserys attending those covetous and eager Desires after things which have no Bounds or Rule; as being out of Nature , beyond which there can be no Limits to Desire. For where shall we once stop, when we are beyond this Boundary? How shall we any way fix or ascertain a thing wholly unnatural and unreasonable ? Or what Method or Regulation shall we set to mere Imagination, or the Exorbitancy of Fancy, in adding Expence to Expence, or Possession to Possession? State or Degree of Fortune they are plac'd; there being no thorow or real Satisfaction, but a kind of Insatiableness belonging to this Condition. For 'tis impossible there shou'd be any real Enjoyment but in consequence of natural and just Appetite . Nor do we readily call that an Enjoyment of Wealth or of Honour, when thro Covetousness or Ambition, the Desire is still forward, and can never rest satisfy'd with its Gains. But against this Vice of Covetousness , there is enough said continually in the World; and in our common way of speaking, " A covetous , and a miserable Temper has, in reality, but one and the same Signification." NOR is there less said, abroad, as to  297 the Ills of that other aspiring Temper, which exceeds an honest Emulation , and Love of Praise , and passes the Bounds even of Vanity and Conceit : such, I mean, as breaks into an enormous Pride and Ambition . If one considers the Ease, Happiness, and a thousand Advantages and Securitys which attend a modest Disposition and quiet Mind , such as is of easy Command, fitted to every Station in Society, and able to sute it-self with any reasonable Circumstances whatever; 'twill not be found necessary any further to call to mind the Excellence and Good of Moderation , and the Mischief and Self-Injury of immoderate Desires, and conceited fond Imaginations of personal Advantage in such things as Titles, Honours, Precedencys, Fame, Glory , or valgar Astonishment, Admiration and Applause. of this kind are rais'd, and become impetuous, and out of our Command; so the Aversions and Fears of the contrary part, grow proportionably strong and violent, and the Temper accordingly suspicious, jealous, captious, subject to Apprehensions from all Events, and uncapable of bearing the least Repulse or ordinary Disappointment. And hence it may be concluded, "That all Rest and Security as to what is future , and all Peace, Contentedness and Ease as to what is present , is forfeited by the aspiring Passions of this emulous kind; and by having the Appetites towards Glory and outward Appearance thus transporting and beyond Command." THERE is a certain Temper plac'd  299 often in opposition to those eager and aspiring Aims of which we have been speaking. Not that it really excludes either the Passion of Covetousness or Ambition ; but because it hinders their Effects, and keeps them from breaking into open Action. 'Tis this Passion, which by soothing the Mind, and softning it into an Excessive Love of Rest and Indolence , renders high Attempts impracticable, and represents as insuperable the Difficultys of a painful and laborious Course towards Wealth and Honours. Now tho an Inclination to Ease, and a Love of moderate Recess and Rest from Action, be as natural and useful to us as the Inclination we have towards Sleep; yet an excessive Love of Rest, and a contracted Aversion to Action and Imployment, must be a Disease in the Mind equal to that of a Lethargy in the Body. How much Action and Exercise are necessary for the Body, let it be judg'd by the difference we find in the Constitutions that are accustom'd, and those that are wholly Strangers to it; and by the different Health and Complexion which Labour and due Exercise create, in comparison with that Habit of Body which we see consequent to an indulg'd State of Indolence and Rest. Nor is the lazy Habit ruinous to the Body only. The languishing Disease corrupts all the Enjoyments of a vigorous and healthy Sense, and carries its Infection into the Mind : where it spreads a worse Contagion. For however the Body may hold out, 'tis impossible that the Mind, in which the Distemper is seated, can escape without an immediate Affliction and Disorder. The Habit begets a Tediousness and Anxiety, which influences the whole Temper, and converts the unnatural Rest into an unhappy sort of Activity, ill Humour, and Spleen: of which there has been enough  300 said above, where we consider'd the want of a due Ballance in the Affections. us'd, the Spirits which want their due Imployment, turn against the Constitution, and find work for themselves in a destructive way; so in a Soul , or Mind , unexercis'd, and which languishes for want of proper Action and Employment, the Thoughts and Affections being obstructed in their due Course, and depriv'd of their natural Energy, raise Disquiet, and foment a rancorous Eagerness and tormenting Irritation. The Temper from hence becomes more impotent in Passion, more incapable of real Moderation, and like prepar'd Fuel, readily takes Fire by the least Spark. is, in which by this Habit a Man is plac'd, towards all the Circumstances and Affairs of Life, when at any time he is call'd to Action; how subjected he must be to all Inconveniences, wanting to himself, and depriv'd of the Assistance of others; whilst being unfit for all Offices and Dutys of Society, he yet of any other Person most needs the help of it, as being least able to assist or support himself; all this is obvious. And thus 'tis evident, "That to have this over-byassing Inclination towards Rest ; this slothful, soft , or effeminate Temper, averse to Labour and Imployment, is to have an unavoidable Mischief , and attendant Plague ." THUS have we consider'd the Self-Passions ;  301 and what the Consequence is of their rising beyond a moderate degree. These Affections, as Self-interesting as they are, can often, we see, become contrary to our real Interest. They betray us into most Misfortunes, and into the greatest of Unhappinesses, that of a profligate and abject Character. As they grow imperious and high, they are the occasion that a Creature in proportion becomes mean and low. They are original to that which we call Selfishness , and give rise to that sordid Disposition of which we have already spoken. It appears that there can be nothing so miserable in itself, or so wretched in its Consequence, as to be thus impotent in Temper, thus master'd by Passion, and by means of it, brought under the most servile Subjection to the World. increases in us, so must a certain Subtlety , and Feignedness of Carriage, which naturally accompanys it. And thus the Candour and Ingenuity of our Natures, the Ease and Freedom of our Minds must be forfeited; all Trust and Confidence in a manner lost; and Suspicions, Jealousys , and Envys multiply'd. A separate End and Interest must be every day more strongly form'd in us: Generous Views and Motives laid aside: And the more we are thus sensibly disjoin'd every day from Society and our Fellows; the worse Opinion we shall have of those uniting Passions which bind us in strict Alliance and Amity with others. Upon these Terms we must of course endeavour to silence and suppress our natural and good Affections: since they are such as wou'd carry us to the Good of Society, against what we fondly conceive to be our private Good and Interest; as has been shewn. occasion of, are withal the certain means of losing us our natural Affections ; then (by what has been prov'd before) 'tis evident, "That they must be the certain means of losing us the chief Enjoyment of Life, and raising in us those horrid and unnatural Passions , and that Savageness of Temper, which makes The Greatest Of Miserys , and the most wretched State of Life:" as remains for us to explain. last place, we are to examine, are those which lead neither to a publick nor a private Good; and are neither of any Advantage to the Species in general, or Creature in particular. These, in opposition to the social and natural , we call the Unnatural Affections. and Inhuman Delight in beholding Torments , and in viewing Distress, Calamity, Blood, Massacre and Destruction, with a peculiar Joy and Pleasure. This has been the reigning Passion of many Tyrants, and barbarous Nations; and belongs, in some degree, to such Tempers as have thrown off that Courteousness of Behaviour which retains in us a just Reverence of Mankind, and prevents the Growth of Harshness and Brutality. This Passion enters not where Civility or affable Manners have the least place. Such is the Nature of what we call good Breeding, that in the midst of many other Corruptions, it admits not of Inhumanity , 305 or savage Pleasure . To see the Sufferance of an Enemy with cruel Delight, may proceed from the height of Anger, Revenge, Fear, and other extended. Self- Passions: But to delight in the Torture and Pain of other Creatures indifferently, Natives or Foreigners, of our own or of another Species, Kindred or no Kindred, known or unknown; to feed, as it were, on Death, and be entertain'd with dying Agonys; this has nothing in it accountable in the way of Self-Interest or private Good above-mention'd, but is wholly and absolutely unnatural, as it is horrid and miserable. to this, which is a gay and frolicksome Delight in what is injurious to others; a sort of Wanton Mischievousness , and Pleasure in what is destructive; a Passion which instead of being restrain'd, is usually incourag'd in Children: so that 'tis indeed no wonder if the Effects of it are very unfortunately felt in the World. For 'twill be hard, I suppose, for any one to give a reason why that Temper which was us'd to delight in Disorder and Ravage, when in a Nursery; shou'd not afterwards find Delight in other Disturbances, and be the occasion of equal Mischief in Familys, amongst Friends, and in the Publick it-self. But of this Passion there is not any foundation in Nature; as has been explain'd. such as is grounded on no Self-Consideration, and where there is no Subject of Anger or Jealousy, nor any thing to provoke or cause such a Desire of doing ill to another; this also is of that kind of Passion. from the Prosperity or Happiness of another Creature no ways interfering with ours, is of the same kind of Passion. reigning in some Men, and has  310 had a peculiar Name given to it. A large share of this belongs to those who have long indulg'd themselves in a habitual Moroseness , or who by force of ill Nature, and ill Breeding, have contracted such a Reverse of Affability, and Civil Manners, that to see or meet a Stranger is offensive. The very Aspect of Mankind is a Disturbance to 'em, and they are sure always to hate at first sight. The Distemper of this kind is sometimes found to be in a manner National ; but peculiar to the more savage Nations, and a plain Characteristick 311 of unciviliz'd Manners, and Barbarity. This is the immediate Opposite to that noble Affection, which, in antient Language, was term'd  312 Hospitality, viz . extensive Love of Mankind, and Relief of Strangers. of the unnatural Passions , all those which are rais'd from Superstition (as before-mention'd) and from the Customs of barbarous Countrys: All which are too horrid and odious in themselves, to need any proof of their being miserable. such as unnatural Lusts in foreign Kinds or Species, with other Perversions of the amorous Desire within our own . But as to these Depravitys of Appetite, we need add nothing here; after what has been already said, on the Subject of the more natural Passion. unnatural, ill , and of no Tendency so much as to any separate or private Good. Others indeed there are which have this Tendency, but are so exorbitant and out of measure, so beyond the common Bent of any ordinary Self-Passion , and so utterly contrary and abhorrent to all social and natural Affection , that they are generally call'd, and may be justly esteem'd unnatural and monstrous. an Enormous Pride or Ambition , such an Arrogance and Tyranny , as wou'd willingly leave nothing eminent, nothing free, nothing prosperous in the World: such an Anger as wou'd sacrifice every thing to it-self: such a Revenge as is never to be extinguish'd, nor ever satisfy'd but with the greatest Crueltys: such an Inveteracy and Rancour as seeks, as it were, occasion to exert it-self; and lays hold of the least Subject, so as often to make the weight of its Malevolence fall even upon such as are mere Objects of Pity and Compassion. are in strictness mere negative Vices; and, in them selves, no real, Passions; having neither Aversion or Inclination belonging to them; but are deriv'd from the Defect, Unsoundness or Corruption of the Affections in general. But when these Vices become remarkable in a Character, and arise in a manner from Inclination and Choice; when they are so forward and active, as to appear of their own accord, without any pressing occasion; 'tis apparent they borrow something of the mere unnatural Passions, and are deriv'd from Malice, Envy , and Inveteracy ; as explain'd above. Passions, unnatural as they are, carry still a sort of Pleasure with them; and that however barbarous a Pleasure it be, yet still it is a Pleasure and Satisfaction which is found in Pride, or Tyranny, Revenge, Malice, or Cruelty exerted. Now if it be possible in Nature, that any one can feel a barbarous or malicious Joy, otherwise than in consequence of mere Anguish and Torment, then may we perhaps allow this kind of Satisfaction to be call'd Pleasure or Delight . But the Case is evidently contrary. To love, and to be kind; to have social or natural Affection, Complacency and Good-Will, is to feel immediate Satisfaction and genuine Content. 'Tis in it-self original Joy , depending on no preceding Pain or Uneasiness; and producing nothing but Satisfaction merely. On the other side, Animosity, Hatred and Bitterness is original Misery and Torment , producing no other Pleasure or Satisfaction, than as the unnatural Desire is for the instant satisfy'd by something that appeases it. How strong soever this Pleasure, therefore, may appear; it does but the more imply the Misery of that State which produces it. For as the cruellest bodily Pains do by Intervals of Assuagement, produce (as has been shewn) the highest bodily Pleasure; so the fiercest and most raging Torments of the Mind, do, by certain moments of Relief, afford the greatest of mental Enjoyments, to those who know little of the truer kind. best of Tempers, have at some time or other been sufficiently acquainted with those Disturbances which, at ill Hours, even small occasions are apt to raise. From these slender Experiences of Harshness and ill Humour, they fully know and will confess the ill Moments that are pass'd, when the Temper is ever so little gall'd or fretted. How must it fare, therefore, with those who hardly know any better hours in Life; and who, for the greatest part of it, are agitated by a thorow active Spleen, a close and settled Malignity, and Rancour? How lively must be the Sense of every thwarting and controuling Accident? How great must be the Shocks of Disappointment, the Stings of Affront, and the Agonys of a working Antipathy, against the multiply'd Objects of Offence? Nor can it therefore be wonder'd at, if to Persons thus agitated and oppress'd, it  319 seems a high Delight to appease and allay for the while those furious and rough Motions, by an Indulgence of their Passion in Mischief and Revenge. Interest, and the common Circumstances of Life; upon what Terms a Person who has in this manner lost all that we call Nature , can be suppos'd to stand, in respect of the Society of Mankind; how he feels himself in it; what Sense he has of his own Disposition towards others, and of the mutual Disposition of others towards himself; this is easily conceiv'd. merited Affection or Love, but, on the contrary, of the ill-Will and Hatred of every human Soul? What ground must this afford for Horrour and Despair? What foundation of Fear, and continual Apprehension from Mankind, and from superiour Powers? How thorow and deep must be that Melancholy , which being once mov'd, has nothing soft or pleasing from the side of Friendship, to allay or divert it? Where-ever such a Creature turns himself; which-ever way he casts his Eye; every thing around must appear ghastly and horrid; every thing hostile, and, as it were, bent against a private and single Being, who is thus divided from every thing, and at defiance and war with the rest of Nature. laid waste, every thing fair and goodly remov'd, and nothing extant but what is savage and deform'd. Now if Banishment from one's Country, Removal to a foreign Place, or any thing that looks like Solitude or Desertion, be so heavy to endure; what must it be to feel this inward Banishment , this real Estrangement from human Commerce; and to be after this manner in a Desart, and in the horridest of Solitudes, even when in the midst of Society? What must it be to live in this Disagreement with every thing, this Irreconcilableness and Opposition to the Order and Government of the Universe? HENCE it appears; That the greatest of Miserys accompanys that State which is consequent to the Loss of natural Affection; and That  TO HAVE THOSE HORRID, MONSTROUS, AND UNNATURAL AFFECTIONS, IS TO BE MISERABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE. since in the common and known Sense of Vice and Illness , no one can be vicious or ill, but either, 1\. By the Deficiency or Weakness of natural Affections ; 2\. Or by the Violence of the selfish ; 3\. Or by such as are plainly unnatural: the Creature, insomuch that his compleatest State of Misery is made from hence; To be wicked or vicious, is, to be miserable and unhappy. towards this Mischief, and Self-Ill ; it must follow, That every vicious Action must be Self-injurious and Ill. prov'd from the contrary Effect of other Affections, such as are according to Nature , and the Oeconomy of the Species or Kind. We have cast up all those Particulars, from whence (as by way of Addition and Substraction) the main Sum or general Account of Happiness, is either augmented or diminish'd. And if there be no Article exceptionable in this Scheme of Moral Arithmetick ; the Subject treated may be said to have an evidence as great as that which is found in Numbers, or Mathematicks. For let us carry Scepticism ever so far; let us doubt, if we can, of every thing about us; we cannot doubt of what passes within our-selves . Our Passions and Affections are known to us. They are certain, whatever the Objects may be, on which they are employ'd. Nor is it of any concern to our Argument how these exteriour Objects stand; whether they are Realitys, or mere Illusions; whether we wake or dream. For ill Dreams will be equally disturbing: And a good Dream (if Life be nothing else) will be easily and happily pass'd. In this Dream of Life, therefore, our Demonstrations have the same force; our Ballance and Oeconomy hold good, and our Obligation to Virtue is in every respect the same. wanting, in what has been said concerning the Preferableness of the mental Pleasures to the sensual ; and even of the sensual, accompany'd 320 with good Affection, and under a temperate and right use , to those that are no ways restrain'd, nor supported by any thing social or affectionate. and Fabrick of the Mind , and of those Passions which constitute the Temper , or Soul; and on which its Happiness or Misery so immediately depend. It has been shewn, That in this Constitution , the impairing of any one Part must instantly tend to the disorder and ruin of other Parts, and of the Whole it- self; thro the necessary Connexion and Ballance of the Affections: That those very Passions thro which Men are vicious, are of themselves a Torment and Disease; and that whatsoever is done which is knowingly ill , must be of ill Consciousness , and in proportion, as the Act is ill, must impair and corrupt social Enjoyment, and destroy both the Capacity of kind Affection , and the Consciousness of meriting any such . So that neither can we participate thus in Joy or Happiness with others, or receive Satisfaction from the mutual Kindness or imagin'd Love of others : on which however the greatest of all our Pleasures are founded. consequent to this Defection from Nature, be of all other the most horrid, oppressive, and miserable; 'twill appear, " That to yield or consent to any thing ill or immoral, is a Breach of Interest, and leads to the greatest Ills :" and, "That, on the other side, Every thing which is an Improvement of Virtue, or an Establishment of right Affection and Integrity, is an Advancement of Interest, and leads to the greatest and most solid Happiness and Enjoyment of Life ." , has made it to be according to the private Interest and Good of every one, to work towards the general Good ; which if a Creature ceases to promote, he is so far wanting to himself, and ceases to promote his own Happiness and Welfare. He is, on this account, his own, Enemy: Nor can he any otherwise be good or useful to himself, than as he is good to Society, and to that Whole of which he is himself a Part . So that Virtue , which of all Excellencys and Beautys is the chief, and most amiable; that which is the Prop and Ornament of human Affairs; which up-holds Communitys, maintains Union, Friendship, and Correspondence amongst Men; that by which Countrys, as well as  321 private Familys, flourish and are happy; and for want of which every thing comely, conspicuous, great and worthy, must perish, and go to ruin; that single Quality , thus beneficial to all Society, and to Mankind in general , is found equally a Happiness and Good to each Creature in particular ; and is that by which alone Man can be happy, and without which he can never but be miserable. one.
