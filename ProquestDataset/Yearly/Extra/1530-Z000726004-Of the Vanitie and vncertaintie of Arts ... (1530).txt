 Philosopher, and a wise Capitaine, saide, That the wisedome of a man, is not somuche knowen by withdrawinge himselfe from the euill, is by choosinge the good, because that commonly vnder the euill any good cannot be hidden, but vnder the good muche euill may be dissembled. Euen as the Enseigne beginneth Persignum Crucis, and endeth in Satanas and Barrabas: So likewise the great euils, take their beginninge in some good deedes, in suche wise that they be counterfaited like Maskes, sugred like Pilles, and gilted like Reubarbe. There is no ma so senseles, which keapeth not himselfe from the euill, whiche is notoriously euill, but a wise man will beware of that whiche is knowen not to be altogeather good. Themistocles the Philosopher, put all his felicitie in descending from a noble linage . Simonides the Philosopher, accompted the greatest happinesse to be well beloued of the people . Antisthenes put all his felicitie in renowme after his death. But Herillus placed the soueraigne good in learninge and knowledge, who shooteth wide of the marke for that, in no wise can be good, whiche is vaine, and vncertaine: howe than can the chiefest felicitie be founde therein? I neede not make in this place, any longe discourse to disproue the vanitee of Artes and Sciences, sithe this Authour hath written thereof at large whiche Inglished, I addresse to your Grace, moste humbly beseechinge you, to accepte it as a pledge of a minde well affected towardes your Honoure, whiche haue not onely the felicitie of Themistocles, to wete, honoure of Parentage, but which is more, haue also confirmed the same with Honour purchased by your owne vertue: you haue the felicitie of Simonides, for you are well beloued of the people: and also dyinge, shall haue the soueraigne good of Antisthenes, for your fame shall foreuer sounde in the eares of men: but to you liuinge, I wishe Nestors yeares, with continuall health, and encrease of Honoure. Your Graces, most humblie to commaunde, Iames Sanford. If in al thinges (gentle Reader) with which God endowed man at his creation nothinge is more to be esteemed then Reason, it foloweth, that the fruites thereof, that is, learninge and knowledge shoulde be had in price. For what is more to be desired then knowledge, the learning, then wisdome, whiche teacheth man to aspire to heauenly thinges, which guideth his doinges, and ruleth his affaires: wherefore Phocilides saithe very well, Wisdome gouerneth Fieldes, Cities, and Shippes . For al thinges be happely exployted, which by the helpe of wisdome are gouerned. Sapience proceedeth of perfecte Reason, ioygned with Learninge, and Knoweledge, whiche if it be true, then consequently it foloweth, that Artes and Sciences are good. And although this Authoure sharply inueigheth against them (which to the rude multitude for that cause, maye seme naught and noysome) yet his intent is, not to deface the worthinesse of Artes and Sciences, but to reproue and detecte theire euil vses, and declare the excellencie of his wit in disprouinge them, for a shewe of Learning: which euil vses, doubtles haue crept in, thorough the peruerse doings of men. There is nothing in this world, which is not corrupted, nor any learning which is not abused, notwithstading the whole circle or compasse of Learning (the Seue Liberall Sciences I meane, called Encyclopoedia ) is not to be neglected, and all humane Artes reiected: for like as diseased bodies, hauinge some infirmitie, are not to be abandoned, but to be recured, preserued, and chearished, so ought Scieces and Knowledges (though there lurke in them some abuse) not to be dispised, but with all endeuour ought to be purged fro their chaffe, and brought to their former perfection. VVho woulde geue credence to this Authoure, and allow him, if he endeuoured to disalow al learninges? it is a vaine thing to dispraise all Knowledges, and a praise to detecte their vanitie. The Authour hereof walked in darkness, and together with his excellency of wit, he declareth in some places his blindes of vnderstandinge: for in the. 2. 6. 57. Cap. he confirmeth as vaine thinges as he disproueth. Some peraduenture wil obiecte, that it is impossible for so excellente a man to erre and be deceiued, who in al learninges (as appeareth) was conuersaunt and well exercised: vnto whome maye be saide that whiche Tullie writeth in the firste of his Offices , where he saith. To be deceiued, to slide, to erre, and to be beguiled is mans propertie: and doubtles, no one man with exceeding great vse and experience of thinges, can attaine to so great skilfulnes and cunninge, that of himselfe he maye decerne al thinges, and not halt and be ouerseene in any, according to the saying of Euripides the Greeke Poete. One ma seeth not al thinges. Socrates , who by the Oracle of Apollo , was iudged the wisest of his age, cofessed that he knew nothing at all, beside a certaine slender discipline of loue. If Socrates knewe so fewe things, then cannot this Authour knowe all things, whose knowledge, although it were great, yet greatly he erred, and no marueil, for he gaue his minde to vnleeful Artes, contrarie to the Lawes of God and man: for it is saide, and his workes testifie the same, that he exercised the Arte Magicke, and therein farre excelled all other of his time, but in the ende, his wicked knowledge was the cause of his miserable deathe: for as Iohn Manlius a Germaine writer doth recorde, when he was at the pointe of death he called to him a dogge, whiche wente aboute with him and spake to him with these woordes. Abi a me perdita bestia, qu ae me perdidisti : that is, Depart fro me thou wicked beast whiche hast destroyed me. So foorthwith the dogge departinge from him, caste himselfe headlonge into a riuer, this dogge was without doubt a Diuel of Hell. The naughtines of the time caused him to be naught, and to perseuer in erroure, for if he shoulde altogeather haue reuolted and gone from the Pope, his life would haue ben in daunger: in part he helde with the Pope and his ministers, maintayning his enormities, in part also he renounceth his Canons, as in the 94. Cap. appeareth, he inueigheth against the foule abuses of Bishops, Abbotes, Monkes, and Freers, and other suche like, defending also the Royal presence of Christ his body. It is likely, that if he had ben in as good a time as this is, he would haue don accordingly, but being in a corrupt time, he did as the time required: where darknes is, menne muste needes fale, and where wickednes raigneth, menne of force become naught. Like as the poisonous Cokatrice infecteth all thinges, so oftentimes the shadowe of naughty menne hurteth the good. One euill corrupteth an other, and euill put to euill, is cause of mutuall destruction: Epictetus the Stoicke Philosopher saithe: Vnderstande, if thy companio shalbe defiled, that he also whom he shal touch must needes be defiled, notwithstandinge he were cleane before: wherefore his faulte is to be ascribed to the time wherin he liued, and to the parsons with whom he was conuersaunt. I conferred an Italian translation with the Latine Copie, in the whiche I founde more then was mencioned in the Latine, whiche I haue put into my translation, the places where this is added, are in the 96, 98, 100, 101. Cap. betweene twoo starres with this forme ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) placed in the Margent. I coniecture that this booke in the Italian was translated out of that Copie, whiche the Authoure first published, and since that time other bookes of the same sort haue ben printed, and in printing some thinges haue ben either depraued by negligence, or lefte out of pourpose, because they sharply inueigh againste the Popes folowers, whiche coniecture is likeliest, for negligence of the Printer woulde haue appeared aswell in other places, as in these, if he beinge rechlesse, has don things without aduisement. VVherfore friendly Reader) wel construe my doinges, take in good part my labours, amende the faultes that are ouerpassed in printinge, and defende this againste the malitious detractions of enuious Zoilus , then shall I accompte thee my friende, thinke my time well spente, and my paines requited. Wil not this my enterprise (studious Reader) seeme vnto thee valiant and aduenturous, & almoste comparable to the attamptes of Hercules to take vp weapons against all that Giaunes force of Sciences and Artes, and to chalenge into the fielde all these moste hardie hunters of Artes and Sciences? The statelinesse of the Doctours, the learninge of the Practisers, the authoritee of the Maisters, the endeuours of the Bachelours, the enuie of all the Scholers, and the sedition of the Handicraftes men, will murmure againste mee. Whiche if I shall vanquishe, will it not be so muche, or more, then to stryke the Nemean Lyon with a mase, to kyll the Hider of Lerna with fire: to slea the Boare of Arimanthus : to take the Golden horned Harte Pillers in the Oceane Sea: to ouercome the Triple headed Gerion: to driue awaie the Oxen: to slea the Bull: to conquere Achelous hande to hande: to steale away Diomedes horses: to drawe Cerberus bounde in chaynes: to take awaie the Golden apples of Hesperides, and many other noble aduentures of this sorte, whiche were done by Hercules with greate labours, and with no lesse daunger, beynge of no lesse trauaile, then perill to ouercome these monsters of Studies and Schooles. And I well perceiue what a blouddy battaile I haue to fighte with them hande to hande, and how daungerous this fight will bee, seeinge that I am beset on euery side with an armie of so mightie ennemies. O with howe many ingins will they assaile mee, & with howe many shames and villanies will they lode moe? First of all the loowise Grammarians will make a stirre, and with their Ftymologies vppon Agrippa wil geue me a goutie name: The peeuishe Poete will put me in theyr verses for Momus, or for Esopes Goate: The triflesellinge Historiographers will defame me more then euer Pausanias terrible lookes, with shall soundinge voyces, and with cruell gestures, will accuse me of robbery. The monstrous Remembrancers will breake my braine with their Imaginations. The obstinate Logitioners, will caste againste me infinite dartes of Sillogismes. The longe tounged Sophisters, which wreast to euery part their talke, with intricate snares of woordes, like a bridle, will stoppe my mouthe. The barbarous Lullist with vnfittinge woordes and Solesismes, me from Heauen and earthe. The Arithmeticiens, Sonnebeame describers, will incense the Usurers against me, compellinge me to render an accompte of my debtes. The brawler Dicer wil driue me to the gallowes. The lotcastinge Pythagorist wil calculate for me infortunate numbers. The Geomantian with his pricke, will caste for me imprisonment, sadnes, and vnfortunate Figures. The Musitians with their many tunes, will me a laughinge stocke thorowe the streates, and with larringe soundes, and vnpleasante ringinge of pannes, basons, and dishes will trouble me more, then they are woonte at their weddinges which be twise maried. The stately dames will exclude me out of their daunces. The wanton maydes will not kisse me. The bablinge handemaydes will scoffe at me as a daunsinge Camell. The daunsinge player wil make a tragedie of me vpon his bawdie stage. The Fencer with his hundreth handes will assaulte me on the righte side, and on the lefte. The doubtfull Geometricians, laiynge on me Triangles, rownde, and square figures, will take me prysoner, beinge as it were entangled in Gordions knot. The vayne woorker in the arte Perspectiue, will engraue and depainte me more bruitishe and deformed, then an Ape or Thersites. The wandringe Cosmographers will bannishe me beyonde Moscouie, and the frosen Sea. The Dedalean builder, with his moste mightie Ingins, will priuely vndermine me, and compel me to wander in confuse Laberinthes. The Infernal Miner wil condemne me to the Golden vnstable turninge of the Heauens wil forbidde me Paradise. The threatning Diuiners, will wishe me all euill. The vnreasonable Phisiognomer, wil defame me for a colde man, and of small force in the acte of Uenerie. The dotinge Metoposcoper, wil pronounce me a brainesicke Asse. The Diuiniuge Palmester, wil declare by his Diuination, that al thinges shalbe to me vnfortunate. The foreknowinge Southesaier, will geue me his blacke curse. The monstruous Gunner, will cast against me the reuenginge flames of Iupiter, & the fier of lightninge. The Interpretour of darke Dreames, will feare me with his horrible night Sprites. The furious Prophet, will deceiue me with his doubtfull Oracle. The monstrous Magitiens, wil transforme me, as it were an other Apulei blacke Necromancer, wil persecute me with Spirites and Diuels. The Churchrobbinge Theurgist, wil offer my head to the crowes, or perhappes to the iakes. The Circumcised Cabalistes, wil wishe me their foreshinne. The vayne and foolishe iuggler, will make me appeere eyther headlesse or without stoanes. The contentious Philisophers, will teare me in peeces with most repugnant opinions. The iuggling Pithagoreans, wil make me go into a Dogge, and a Crocodile. The filthy and carpinge Cinickes, will close me vp in a Tunne, or a Graue. The pestilent Academickes, will crie vpon me to make my wyse common. The deuouringe Epicures, will kill me with surfettinge. The wicked Peripatetickes, will make my soule mortall, and exclude it out of Paradise. The seuere Stoikes, takynge away the griefe of mans minde, will transforme me into a stone. The vaine Metaphisici, wil euery howre confounde my minde with Paradoxes of thinges that neuer were, nor neuer shalbe, as of the Demogorgoneon Chaos. The Morall Philosophers, correcters of manners, will write me in a hundreth Tables. The politike Lawemaker, will forbidde me to beare Office in the Publike weale. The Voluptuous Prince, will bannishe me the Courte. The Ambitious Noblemen, will put me out of the Senate. The brainelesse People, will exclaime on me in the streates. The terrible Tirante Phalaris, will include me in his Bull to tormente me. The sedicious Gouernours, wil driue me into banishement. The furious People, and the many headed cruell beast, without hearinge my cause will put me to deathe. Euery decayed Common weale will condemne me of Treason. The Couetous Priestes, will excommunicate me. The Hooded Maskers, and spitefull Hipocrites, will rayle againste me out of the Pulpit. The Almightie Bishoppes, will reserue my sinnes for Euerlastinge fire. The Lecherous Whoores, wil threaten to geue me the French Poets. The greedie Ruffian, and the howsinge Bawde, wil gelde my purse. The scabbed Beggers wil exclude me out of their Hospitall. The wandringe Pardoners, will offer me S. Anthonies fire, furious sclaunder, and depriue me of their Indulgences. The vnfaithful Stewarde, will make me indebted to the Bocherie. The blasphemous Maciner, will dashe me againste Scylla. The false Marchante, will eate me out with Exchaunge and Usurie. The theeuishe Treasourer, will steale my stypende. The churlishe Husbandmen, wil forbid me their pleasant Gardens. The loytering Sheapherdes, wil geue me to the Woolfes. The watercoursinge Fisher, will laye a priuie bayte for me. The hallowinge Hunter, will set his houndes and hawkes vpon me. The mightie armed Souldiour wil take my purse. The gallant Gentlemen wil caste me out of their companie. The Herauldes cladde in ceate Armour, will take away my Auncestoures, Armes, & forbiddinge me from ridinge at the Tylte (which they terme Turnamentes) will proclaime me for a tributary countrey man. The perbrake Phisitians, will embrue me with Urine and Ordure: of the which the bablinge Logitioner, disputing of sickenesse, wil take from me a remedie in season. The rashe Practiser, with a doubtfull experiment, will pnt me in daunger of deathe. The subtile olde beaten Phisition, deferringe the remedies, wil prolonge the sickenesse for his owne auayle. She filthy Apothecaries, will sucke me drie with their Clisters. The goldinge Chirurgians, will lie in wayte for my teethe and stones. The cruell Anatomistes, will craue me for Infection.

The arrogant Canonistes, will Excommunicate me with cruell Cursinges. The brawlinge Aduocates, will bringe againste me fyre hundreth accusations. The wylie Proctour, abandoninge my cause in Plea, will by couins ioygne in Plea with mine aduersarie. The doubtfull notarie, will subscribe falsely. The vntreatable Iudge, will condemne me in mine Action, and deny me the Apostles of Appeale, as they terme them. The imperious Archescribe Chauncellour, will not aomitee my supplication. The obstinate Diuine Sophistricall Doctours, will call me Heretike, or compell me to woorshippe their Zooles. Our grimme Maisters wil enforce me to recante: and the Atlantes of Sorbona, will hisse and clappe their handes at me. Nowe Reader, thou perceiuest thorowe howe many daungers I shall passe: Yet I hope easelie to escape these assaultes, if thou, supportinge the truethe, and settinge enuie aparte, shalte come with a gentle minde to the readinge of these thinges. Beside this, I haue the Woorde of God, wherewith to defende my selfe, whiche boldely I wil holde againste these for a Buckler and Shielde. And if it be expedient for me whiche haue for the loue of him, stirred vp so many enemies againste me, I will willingly dye before I will abandon it. And I woulde haue thee vnderstande, that I wrote not these thinges for hatred, for ambition, for deceipte, or for erroure: neither a wicked desire, nor the arrogancie of a lewde minde, hath moued me to write this: but the cause of all men, moste iuste and righteous, because I see many ware prowde in Humane learninge and knowledge, that therefore they do despise and lothe, the Sacred and Canonicall Scriptures of the Holie Ghoste, as rude and rusticall, because they haue no ornamentes of woordes, force of sillogismes, and affectate perswasions, nor the strange doctrine of the Philosophers: but are simply grounded vpon the operation of Uertue, and vpon bare Faithe, but beside this they haue it in greate contempte. Wee see other also, the whiche although they seeme to them selues very Godly, notwithstandinge will proue and confirme the Lawes, with the Decrees of Philosophers, attributinge more to them, then to the Holie Prophetes of God, or to the Euangelistes, and Apostles, they beynge as contrary to them, as White is from Blacke. Furthermore, in many, and almoste in al places of studie, a peruerse custome, and damnable vse is growen, in that they binde with an othe, the schollers which they receiue to teache, neuer to speake against Aristole, Boetius, Thomas, Albert, or against any other of their Schollers, beinge accompted as a God, from whom, if a man differ a fingers breadth in thought, immediately they will call him Heretike, a sinful person, an offendour of godly eares, and woorthy to be burned. These then so vnaduised Giantes, and ennemies of the Holie Scriptures, are to be assalted, and their Fortresses and Castles ransaked, and to declare howe greate the blindenesse of men is, with so many Sciences and Artes, and with so many Maisters and Authours, alwaies to erre from the knowledge of the Truethe: and howe greate a rashenesse, and presumptuous arrogancie it is, to preferre the schooles of Philosophers, before the Church of Christe: And to set before, and make equiualent, the opinions of men, with the Woorde of God. Fidally, what a wicked Tyrannie it is, to bynde the wittes of Studetes to certaine appointed Authours, and to take from Schollers, the libertie to searche and trace out Trueth. All whiche thinges, sith they are so apparant that they can not be denied, I must haue pardon, if to any I shall seeme to haue declaimed somwhat largely, and peraduenture sharpely, against any kinde of Learninge, or against their Professours. the Philosophers, by the whiche they thinke, that euery Science doothe bringe vnto man some Diuinitee, accordinge to the capacitie and value of them both, so that oftentimes, beyonde the limites of Humanitie, they may be reckened amonge the felowship of the Goodes. From hence arose the diuers and infinite commendations of Sciences, with which euery man dooth endeuour with no lesse eloquente, then longe discourse, to exalte and extoll aboue the Heauens, these Artes and Disciplines, in the whiche by continuall exercise, euery man hath whetted the strength of his witte. Notwithstandinge I, beinge perswaded with other kinde of reasons, am of opinion, that there can chaunce to the life and saluation of our Soules, nothinge more hurtfull and pestilente, then these Artes and Sciences. Wherefore, I thinke good to entreate with a contrary order, and my opinion is, that the Sciences ought not to be extolled with so great praises, but rather for the moste parte, to be despised: and that there is none whiche is without iuste blame and reprehension, nor that of it selfe deserueth praise, but that whiche it getteth of his honestie that professeth the same. I desire, that this my Iudgement be receiued of you, with that modestie, that ye thinke not that I woulde reprooue other, whiche are of a contrary opinion: neither to attribute to my selfe any thinge ouer prowdly. Therefore pardon me, if herein I disagree from others, vntill I shall beginne this mine opinion at euery Science by the order of the letters, not onely with common argumentes, and taken from the outwarde shewe of thinges, but with very stronge reasons, and suche as are sifted out of the inwarde boowelles of thinges: not with any subtile eloquence of Demosthenes or Chrisippus (the whiche shoulde be a shamefull thinge for me, professinge Diuinitee) as one that loueth flattery, if I should seeke for the counterfaite coulers of speech: For that a professour of the Holy Scripture, ought to 1 speake Properly, and not Eloquently: and to searche out the veritie of the matter, and not the garnishinge of speache, for the seate of Trueth is in the harte, and not in the tounge: Neither dooth it make any matter, what speache we vse in tellinge of the Trueth, because that a Lie needeth eloquence and pleasant speach, that it may pearce and creepe into the mindes of men: but 2 painted and coloured woordes. If so be then, I shall printe in your moste delicate cares, this my enterprise, without any floower of eloquence (the which is nowe of vs aswell to be neglected, as blamed) I pray you to endure this with that patience, with the which that Romaine Emperour in time past did, when he stoode still with his armie, to here a poore woman speake: and the kinge Archisilaus sometime woulde here men of a hoarse and vnpleasant voice, because that heringe afterward eloquent men, he might conceaue greatter pleasure. Remember this saiynge in presence of the wysest and mightiest men, so that they speake with faithfulnesse and reason. And that I may not suffer you to geue eare in vaine, I wil now sette before your eyes, with what footinge, and trasinge (as though with houndes) I haue founde out this my saide opinion. If firste I shall admonishe you, that all Sciences be as well naught as good, and that they bringe to vs, aboue the limite of Humanitee, none other blessing of the Deitee, but that perchance, which that auncient Serpent promised to our firste parentes, saiynge, Ye shalbe Goddes, and shall know good and ill. He shall then vaunte himselfe in this Serpente, whiche bosteth himselfe to haue knowledge, as wee reade in deede that the Heretikes Ophiti did, whiche woorshipped the Serpente in their Sacrifices, saiyng, That he hath brought the knowledge of Vertue into Paradise. with these agreeth the historie of Plato, that a 4 deuiser of Sciences, no lesse hurtful then profitable: as very wisely saide Thamus kinge of Egypte, reasoninge of the inuentours of Sciences and Letters. Hereof it commeth to passe, that all Grammarians, for the moste parte, doo expounde this woord D aemon, that is, a Spirite, as if it were Sapiens, that is, Wise: but put the case it be so, let vs leaue these Fables to their Poetes and Philosophers, and lette there be no other inuentours of Sciences then men, and we knowe that they were the children of a moste wicked generation, I meane, the children of Cain, and of whiche are truely spoken: The children of this world, is more wise then the children of light, in this generation. Wherefore if men be the Inuenters of Sciences, is not euery man a lier, neither is there one that dooth good? But let vs say, that there are againe some good men, shall not then the Sciences haue no goodnesse, nor trueth, exceptinge that, which they take & get of the that professe & possesse the same? For if they chaunce vpon any naughtie man, they shalbe hurtful, and of an ill man, they will make a woorse: As a peruerse Grammarian, a vaine Poete, a liynge Historiographer, a flatteringe Rhetorician, a boastinge professour of Memorie, a striuinge Logitioner, a cauelinge Sophister, a pratingre Lullist, a lofcastinge Arithmetician, a lasciuious Musitian, an impudente Dauncer, a vauntinge Geometrician, a wandringe Cosmographer, a pernicious Builder, a theeuishe Mariner, a false Astronomer, a wicked Wiche, a disloial Cabalist, a dreaming Naturall Philosopher, a monstruouse teller of Supernaturall thinges, a wayward Morall Philosopher, an vniust Politike person, a tyrannouse Prince, an oppressinge Magistrate, a sedicious People, a Sismatical Prieste, a Supersticious Murike, a Prodigall Housholder, a falsesworne Marchaunte, a robbinge Treasourer, a sluggishe Husbandman, a theeuishe Sheaphearde, a backebiting Fisher, a stealinge Hunter, a spoiling Souldiour, a Nobleman powler of his tenantes, a murdering Phisicion, a poysoninge Apothecarie, a raueninge Cooke, an abusinge Alcumiste, a subtile Lawier, an Aduocate defendinge a thowsande Ribaldries, a false Notarie, a Iudge corrupte, and a theefe in his Honourable seate of Iudgemente, an Heretical Diuine, and a misleader of the whole multitude. And truely there is nothinge more vnprofitable, then an Arte, & a Science, hedged in with wickednesse: and the greatest and best learned Artificer, is the woorste authour of naughtie thinges. But, if this Science be founde in some man, not so naught, as foolishe, yet there may none in the worlde, be more prowde and vnreasonable then he: for bisides that whiche he hath in him of natural folie, the authoritie of Learninge defendath it, and hath the Letters, for an instrument to maintaine his madnes: the whiche, because that other fooles doo wante, theyr frensie is more milder, as saith Plato of the Oratour. For (saith he) the more vnwise, and vnlearned he shalbe, the more thinges he wil speake: he will counterfaite all thinges, and will thinke that nothinge is vnmeete for him. Wherefore, there is nothinge more Pestilente, then aduisedlie to dote. But, if some good and wyse man possesse the same, peraduenture the Sciences, wilbe good and auailable to the Common Weale, yet therefore they will not make their possessour the more blessed: for (as Porphirius and Iamblicus say) the heapinge togeather of woordes, and the multitude of learninges, is a blessednesse, whiche receiueth no increase, accordinge to the quantitie of reasons & woords. But if it were so, that nothinge shoulde hinder them, from beinge happie, whiche haue gathered togeather all learninges: and he whiche wanteth these, vnhappy: so the Philosophers, shall be more blessed, then Gods Ministers. For the true felicitee, consisteth not in the knowledge of goodnesse, but in a good life: not in vnderstandinge, but in liuinge, with vnderstandinge: For not the good vnderstandinge, but the good will, ioygneth men vnto God. Neither doo the Sciences any thinge els, beinge outwardly applied vnto vs, but that they geue vs, a certaine purgeinge estate, availynge somewhat to Felicitee: yet they shewe not the verie waye, whereby wee maie be made altogeather happie, excepte they haue a life translated into the verie nature of Goodnesse: For as Cicero saieth, defending Archias, It hath bene very often founde, that nature without learninge, hath auailed more to get to praise and vertue, then learninge without nature. It shall not then be necessarie for vs, to fill the minde, with so longe, so difficulte, and vneth vnsearcheable learninges of all Sciences, as the Auerroistes doo affirme: the whiche, Aristotle him selfe saieth, to be the moste common felicitee, and to the which, al men may easely attaine, through a certaine doctrine & diligence, whiche (he saieth) to be an easie, and as it were a common power of beholding the obiecte, the noblest aboue all other, that is God: the whiche acte truely of contemplation, beinge so easie and common to all men, is not made perfecte with Syllogismes and Demonstrations, but with Beleefe and Woorshippe. What felicitee then, is there now in Sciences? Or what is the praise, and the blessednesse of wise men, and Philosophers, of whom all Schooles doo ringe and sounde, with their glorie, whose Soules Hell doth heare and see, to be formented with cruell punishmentes? Augustine knewe this, and was afraide, speakinge with a lowde voice, this saiynge of Paule: The Ignorante arise, and take the Kingedome of Heauen: and we with our learninge, fall, headlonge into Hell. And if it be leefull to confesse the trueth, the doctrine of euery Science, is so daungerous, and vnstable, that it is much more suretie, to be ignorante, then learned. Adam had neuer bene banished out of the Paradise of Blessednesse, if he had not learned, of his maister the Serpente, to knowe good and ill. And Paule willeth, that they shoulde be chased out of the Churche, that would knowe more then they ought. Socrates, after that he had founde out welneare al learnings, was then iudged, by the Oracle, of all men the wisest, when openly he confessed, to knowe nothinge. The knowledge of all Sciences, is so difficulte (I will not say impossible) that all mans life will faile, before one small iote of learning, maie perfitely be founde out: which thing, it seemeth vnto me, that Ecclefiastes affirmeth, when 5 the woorkes of God, of them which are vnder the Sonne, and the more he shall labour to searche, the lesse he shall finde: although the wise man saie, that he knoweth them, he shall not be able to finde them. Nothinge can chaunce vnto man more pestilente, then knowledge: this is the very pestilence, 6 that putteth all mankinde to ruine, the which chaseth awaie all Innocencie, and hath made vs subiecte to so many kindes vs sinne, and to death also: whiche hath extinguished the light of Faith, castinge our Soules into blinde darkenesse: which condemninge the truethe, hath placed errours in the hiest throne. Wherfore Valentianus the Emperour seemeth not to be despised, who (as it is reported) was an ennemie to learninge: Neither Licinius the Emperour, who was accustomed to saie, that Learninge was a poyson, and a 7 him selfe, the moste abundant welspringe of Learninge, despised it at length. And so large is the libertee of the Trueth, and the largenesse thereof so free, that it can not be perceiued, with the speculations of any Science, nor with any straite iudgement of the Sences, nor with any argumentes of the Arte of Logike, nor with any euident proofe, with no Sillegismes of Demonstration, nor with any discourse of mans reason, but with Faithe Onely: whiche who so hath, is named of Aristotle, in his firste booke of Resolutions, better disposed, then if he were learned: the whiche thinge Philopomus expoundeth, saiynge, that the man whiche knoweth it thus, is better then he whiche knoweth by Demonstration, which is doone by the cause. Theophrastus, in his bookes of Transnaturall thinges, saieth this: We may contemplate, euen vntill some thinge by the cause, takinge the beginninges at the Sences: but when we haue passed ouer with the endes and the beginninges, we can knowe no more, either because we haue not the Cause, or for the infirmitee of our vnderstandinge. And Plato in Tim aeus, saith, That to expounde these thinges, is aboue our reache, but willeth credite to be geuen to them, who haue spoken of it before, albeit they speake not, with any necessitie of Demonstration: For the Academikes were had in price, the whiche saide, that nothinge might be affirmed: There were the Pirroinkes, and many other, that affirmed nothinge. Therefore, Science hath no especiall thinge, aboue the very Beleefe, that is, where the goodnesse of the Authour, moueth the free will of the Schollers Beleefe. Hereof springeth this saiynge of the Pythagoreans,  8 that common Prouerbe of the Peripatetikes. We must beleeue euery cunninge man in his Arte. So we beleeue the Grammarian, in the signification of woordes. The Logitioner, geueth creditt to ye Partes of Speache, receiued of the Grammarian. The Rhetorician, taketh of the Logitioner, places of Argumentacion. The Poete boroweth measures of the Musitian. The Geometrician, taketh Proportions of the Arithmetrician. The Astrologian, geueth credite to bothe. Furthermore, the Supernaturall Philosophers, vse the coniectures of Naturall Philosophers: And euery Artificer, dooth presume well of the Statutes of an other. For euery Science, hath in it some certaine Principles, which must be beleued, and can not by any meanes be declared: which if any will obstinately deny, the Philosophers haue not wherewith to dispute against him, and immediately they wil saie, that there is no disputacion against him, whiche denieth the Principles: or els will constraine him to flee vnto some other thinges, without the limites of learninge: As if any (say they) shall denie the fyre is hote, let him be cast into the fyre, and let him be demaunded what he feeleth: so finally, of Philosophers, they are made tormentours and hangmen, for they will by force, compell vs to confesse that, whiche they shoulde teache by reason. Therefore there is nothinge more noysome, nor more hurtefull to the publike weale, then Learninge and Sciences, wherein if there be men endowed with erudition and knowledge, mattiers are, for the moste parte, executed at their will, as those which knowe moste: and trustinge in the simplicitie of the people, and in the ignorance of the multitude, they take to them selues, againste righte and reason, all the authoritie of Office, whereupon the state of the Common wealthe passeth from the peoples rule, to the rule of a fewe, and afterwarde, deuided into partes, dooth soone turne to Tyrannie: whiche, no man is reade at eny time, in all the worlde, to haue obteined without Science, without Doctrine, or without Learninge, excepte Lucius Scylla the Dictatour onely, who tooke rule in hand without learninge: wherein notwithstandinge, the Weale Publike is very muche bounde to the ignorance of Learninge, for this, that in the ende, of his owne free will he layde Tyrannie aside. Moreouer, al 9 Sciences are nothinge els, but the ordinaunces and opinions of men, so noysome as profitable, so pestilent as holsome, so ill as good, in no parte perfecte, but doubtful and full of errour and contention: and that this is true, we will nowe declare it, passinge from one to one, thoroughout all the doctrines of Sciences. Firste of all, who dooth not see, that the Artes of well speakinge, I meane Grammer, Logike, and Rhetorike, the whiche onely be entries, and doores to Sciences, and not Sciences, oftentimes they bringe with them no lesse pestilence then pleasure, in the whiche yet there is no other rule of the Trueth, then the decrees and will of some, that did firste teache: the which thinge is moste manifestly seene, euen by the very inuention of Letters, whiche are the firste elementes, and instrumentes of these Artes: Of the whiche, the firste were the Chaldean letters, inuented by Abraham, te Assirians. Afterwarde Moises gaue Letters to the Iewes, peraduenture not with these Carracters, which are vsed nowe adayes, which are thought to be inuented by Esre, who is supposed to haue written almoste all the bookes of the Olde Testamente. Furthermore, a certaine man called Linus Chalcides, brought the Letters of the Phoenicians to the Gr aecians, whiche vsed them, vntill Cadmus, Agenors sonne, gaue them newe Letters, with an other Carracter, which were sixteene in number, to the whiche Palamedes in the Troiane warre added fower, afterwarde Simonides Melicus added other fower. But the firste that taught the Egyptians the vse of writinge, was a certaine man named Memona, by the figures of beastes, as it is seene in the Piramides: and the firste that gaue them Letters, was Mercurius, that is he, whiche Lactantius saithe, to be the fifte Mercurius, to whom, Vulcanus the sonne of Nilus, Carmenta, gaue Letters to the Latines. Wherefore in times paste, seuen kinde of Letters were had in price, the Hebrewe, the Greeke, the Latine, the Syrian, the Caldean, the Egyptian, and the Geticke, of the which Crinitus Firste Moses wrote the Hebrewe letter. The Phoeonwes with witte the Greeke did deuise. Nicostrata and Abram made Carracters, Of one of the Latine letters did firste rise, The Sirian did the other firste finde out, The same man eke the Chaldean did inuent. VVith no lesse arte did Isis goe aboute To write the Gyptian letters. Then last sent Galfilla letters to the Geetes abrode. Afterwarde, the other People, and barbarouse Nations, in the later times inuented Letters: For the Bishoppe Gordianus, gaue Letters to the Gothes, and the auncient Frenchemen (the whiche made Fraunce subicte to Marcomir and Pharamonde) had the Carracters of their Letters little differinge from the Greeks, with the whiche VVastalde wrote an Historie in their tounge, but he is not knowen which inuented these Letters: there are yet extante other letters of the Frenchmen, the whiche a certaine man called Doracus did deuise, but muche differinge from the Carracte of VVastald: and other afterwarde inuinted by Hichus the Frencheman, who came with Marcomir to the entrie of the ryuer of Rhene from Scithia, whiche were the Letters of certaine Normans. And many other Nations, in like manner haue either made newe Carracters of Letters, or haue partely chaunged them, beynge taken of the Auncientes, or els haue corrupted them, as the Dalmatians haue the Greeke, and the Armenians the Calde: but the Gothes and Longobardes, haue disfigured the Carracters of the Latine Letters. Moreouer, many aunciente Letters haue perished, as them of the auncient Tuscanes, the whiche (as Plinie and Liuie testified) were in times paste, had in greate price amonge the Romans, and at this daie the forme of them is seene in the aunciente Monumentes, but altogeather vnknowne: for when the Romanes in times past, had all the worlde in subiection, the auncient and proper Letters of euery Nation being canceled and rased, they by compulsion ioygned them to vse their Letters.. In this manner perished the Letters of the Hebrews, when they were ledde captiue into Babilon, and their language was corrupted by the Caldees. Spaniardes, and other Nations, when the Romane Carracters were brought in their place, and the languages of these Nations were corrupted & againe corrupted and altered by the Gothes, Longobardes, Frenchemen, and other barbarous Nations: Neither is the Latine tounge in these daies, as it was in times past: and there is a great contention of the Hebrewes tounge and Carracter, betwene the Thalmudistes: For maister Iehuda saithe, that the firste parente Adam spake in the Aramean tounge: Marsura saithe, that the lawe geuen by Moises, was in the Carracter, which is called the Hebrewe, but in the Holy tounge, the whiche beynge chaunged by Esdras into the Aramean tounge, and Assirian Carrecters, a while after, kepinge the Assirian Carracters, tooke againe the Holy tounge, hauinge leste the Hebrewe Carracter, with the Aramean tounge, to the Chusi, that is, to them, that togeather haue receaued the Lawe, and woorshippe Idolles, as the Samaritanes were. Some other say, that from the beginninge the Lawe was not written with other Carracters, then with them that be vsed at this present, but for sinne sometimes the Carrecter was changed, and after repentaunce restored againe. Rabbi Simon, the sonne of Eleasar, thinketh that the language and Carracter, was neuer chaunged, in so much that touchinge Hebraical matters, there is founde nothinge of certaintee amonge the Hebrewes them selues: and this is the alteration of times, that there are no Letters, no Tounges, the whiche at this day doo acknowledge, or vnderstande the forme of manuer of their Antiquitee. But of these biginninges, so vnconstant, and at euerie season so mutable, of letters (I speake) and tounges, did Grammer firste proceede, and after that the other Artes of well speakinge, of the whiche we haue made mention. For seeinge that it seemed not sufficient to knowe the letters, excepte they were toygued with a certaine degree, and forme, and so of the letters sillables, and finally, of these were framed woordes, and for the vnderstandinge of speache were ioygned togeather, wyse men haue taken in hande to make rules of speaking, that is, the constructions of the Regimente, and of the Significates, and, as it were, to bridle the tounge, that whatsoeuer should be spoken according to them, might be well spoke, & should be the Arte of well speakinge, & they haue termed this Arte Grammer: it is sayde, that amonge the Greekes, Prometheus was the firste inuentour therof: the firste that broughte it to Rome, was a certaine man called Crates Mallotes, sente by Attalus to the Senate, betweene the seconde and thyrde Panicke warre, the which afterwarde Palemon professed with greate pompe, in so much that he gaue name to the Arte, and Grammer was called Palemons Arte: he was a very arrogant man, that he auaunted that knowledge tooke beginninge with him, and shoulde die with him: and so prowde, that he had in contempte all the best learned men of his time: and was so bolde to call Marcus Varro him selfe a pigge. Notwithstadinge, the Latine Gramer is so poore & needinge, & bounde to the Greek literature, that he which vnderstandeth not this, is incontinentlie to be reiected out of the number of Grammarians. Wherefore all the feate of litterature or grammar, consisteth but in the only vse and authoritie of the Elders, to whom it liked that euerie thinge shoulde be so called and written, and that the woordes shoulde be so construed and made, the whiche thing they did then terme to be wel spoken. Wherevpon Grammar dothe of righte boaste her selfe to be the arte of speakinge, but falsly, sithe that we learne it much better of oure mothers, & of nourises, then of the Grammarians. Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, framed their speache, the whiche were accompted verie eloquente. Istrina taughte her sonne Siles the greeke tongue, whose Father Aripithes was kinge of Scithia. It is knowne that in manye prouinces people were broughte in out of strange Nations, and that theire sonnes alwaies kepte their mothers speache. Hereof Plato  & Quintilian did so carefullie ordaine, that a meete courise shoulde be Thosen for children. God forbidde then, that we should deriue from them, to the Grammarians, this maner of wel speakinge, the whiche, for so muche as they professe nothinge besides Grammar alone, do knowe nothing lesse. For Priscian coulde not learne this, no not in all his life time: and it is saide, that Didimum wrote thereof fowre thousande bookes, or as somme saie, fixe thousande. We reade, that Claudius C aesar, was so mutche geuen to the greeke Letters, that he added three newe Letters to that tongue, which afterwarde, being Emperoure, he did not omitte. And Charles the great, deuised a Grammar of the Germaine tongue, and gaue newe names to the Monethes and Windes. And continuallie vntil this daie menne labour day and nighte, Commentaries are written, Elegancies, Questions, Annotations, compendious expositions, Obseruations, Castigations, Centur ae, Muscellanea, Antiquities, Paradoxes, Collections, Additions, Lucubrations, Edition vpon Edition. And in the meane space, there are published so manie Gramars, as there be Grammarians. Notwithstanding, none of them, whether he were Greeke or Latine, hath rendred a reason, howe the Partes of Speache shoulde be distinguished, what order is to be obserued in their construction: whether there be xv. pronounes onlie, as Priscian put by him selfe, doth remaine sometime for a participle: whether the Gerundes, be Nounes, or Uerbes. Why the Greekes do ioine the plural nownes of the neuter gendre, with a verbe of the singular number. By what reason is it lawful for the Latins to pronounce in um, nownes endinge in u and us, as for Margarita, Margaritum, for puctus, punctum. By what meanes the nominatiue case of Iupiter, maketh Iouis, in the genitiue case. And by what reason, some do allowe Uerbes newters, some other do exclude them. Why some do write many Latine woordes with a Greeke diphthonge, some not as foelix & qu aestio. And whether in latine these diphthonges oe, are written, so vnder one sillable be pronounced. In like manner why it is, that in many latine wordes some vse & greekey, other the latine i, only, as in considero. Also certaine me in some woordes do double the letters, some not, as in caussa and relligio. Why caccabus, hauing the firste sillable longe by the position of the double cc, notwithstanding of many Poetes is for the most parte made shorte. Also whether Aristotles anima leaue to speake of infinite contentions of theirs, which wil neuer cease, of Accentes, of Orthographie, of Pronuntiation, of Letters, of Figures, of Etimologie, of Analogie, & other preceptes, & rules, Declensons, & moodes of signification, of ye Alteration of cases, & varietie of times, of moodes, of persons, of nubers & of diuers impedimetes & order of Costruction. And finally, of ye number, and genealogy, of the latine letters: and whether H, be a letter or not, and many other like thinges. So not onlye in wordes and sillables they do differ one from an other, but also in the Letters, without geuinge of any reason. Sutche a fighte did Lucianus Samothensis sportingly write, in a very pleasant booke, of the consonantes S. T. the example whereof, may be geuen in thalassa and thalatta. One Andreas Salernitanus, wrote also with studious eloquence the Grammatical warre, vpon the same matter. But these thinges are fewe in number, and meane. We may speake more thinges  & greater, of the corrupte interpretationi of woordes, with which they doo so muche deceiue the whole worlde: of the which  11 arise no small mischiefes in the Common wealth, while they expounde bondage to be subiecte to the lawes, and interprete that to be libertie of Citisens, where it is leefull for euery man to doo what he listeth, and they terme that Isonomia, that is, equalitee of lawe, where to all men, without difference, is ministred one iustice, one honoure, and one rewarde. In like manner they saie, tht Empyre to be quiet, where all thinges are gouerned to the Princes pleasure: moste happie, where the people doo abounde in Lecherie and Idlenesse. And with infinite like expositions, Phisicke, the lawes, and Canons, are corrupted, with the whiche, they dooe euer compell the Holie Scripture, and Christe him selfe, to disagree from him selfe, wrestinge them, not to the meaninge of the Holie Ghoste, neither to the common saluation of men, but to their owne commoditie. Of the whiche thinge oftentimes men haue incurred verie great daungers, as erroure in woordes is woonte to cause erroure in thinges. Like as Saule the firste kinge of the Hebrewes, in tymes paste was deceaued in the woorde Zobar, the which signifieth, Masculine, and Remembraunce, when God had spoken, I will rase out the remembraunce of Amelech, Saule supposed, if he had destroyed the Males, he had obeyed Gods commaundement. There chaunced the like errour to the Greekes, & to the Latines, in the woord Phos, the which signifieth a Man, and the Lighte: wherupon ambiguitee of the woorde, offered euerie yeere a man to Saturnus, when they mighte aswell haue appeased him with of burninge lightes. The whiche Nation beinge so foolishe, in the ende was redressed by Hercules, that afterwarde they became wise. At length also the Diuines, & the hooded Friers puttinge theselues in emonge the Grammarians, were at daggers drawinge, for the signification of woordes, with many additions of Heresies, turninge topsetturuie the Scriptures, by reason of Grammar, beinge become naughtie interpretours of thinges, that are well spoken, vaine men, and verelie vnhappie, makinge them selues blinde with their owne arte, fleinge the lighte of the truth: & whilest ouer curiouslie they searche out the vertue of woordes, they will not vnderstande the sence of the Scriptures, but takinge holde on the bare woordes, doo staie vpon them, subuertinge, and losinge the woordes of the truthe. As it is saide of a Prieste (whether it be true, or a Fable) 12 who when he had many burnte offringes, to the ende he mighte not offende againste Grammar, he consecrated them with these woordes, H aec sunt Corpora mea, that is, these are my Bodies. But from whence came that wicked Heresie of the Antidicomariatans, and of the Eluidians, the whiche denie the perpetuall virginitee of the gloriouse virgine Marie, mother of Christe, but of this onely woorde Donec? where it is reade in the Gospell, that Ioseph did not knowe her vntil shee had brought foorthe her firste begotten Sonne. What greate contention haue these twoo little woordes, Ex, and Per, raised betweene the Greeke, and the Latine Churches? the Latins affirminge that the Holy Ghoste proceedeth of the Father and the Sonne, and the Greekes sayinge that not of the Sonne, but of the Father, by the Sonne. Againe how many Tragedies hath this woorde Nisi, moued in the Counsaile of Basell? The Bohemians affirminge, that the Communion of bothe Kindes is necessarie, because it is written: Excepte yee shall eate the fleshe of the Sonne of man, and drincke his Bloude, yee shall haue no life in you. From whence came that Opinion of the VValdenses but of this woorde, is, whiche they woulde haue onely to be spoken Symbolically, and significatiuely, and that there is a figure in the woordes, the Romishe Churche expoundinge it essentially? There are besides other damnable Heresies emonge the Grammarians, but so obscure and so subtile, that excepte the verie wilie Diuines of Oxforde, and the Sorbonistes of Paris, had perceiued them with theire percinge eyes, and condemned them with theire profounde iudgementes, scarcelie any coulde beware. Of this sorte are these, if any will vprightly iudge this a like well spoken, Christus pr aedicas, Christus praedicat, Ego credis, tu credit, credens est ego. And that this woorde Manens maie be depriued of al his Accidentes. And that no Nowne is of the third person, and suche like. The whiche truely if they shoulde be called Heresies, firste of all the Prophetes Esay, and Malachie, shalbe Heretiques: bothe of whiche, bringe in God speakinge of him selfe: the firste to Ezechiel, with these woordes: Ecce ego addet super dies tuos  &c. For he doth not saie, Addam in the first person, but Addet in the third person. The other saithe in this manner: & si Domini ego, vbi esttimor meus? in the which place he maketh that God calleth him selfe Domini in the plurall number. There be infinite thinges like vnto these: and it is a pitifull case in our age, to see what greate contentions and errours the obstinate Grammarians, & the prowde Sophisters doo stirre vp, with their peruerse interpretations of woordes, while some doo gather of woordes, sentences, other contrarie wise, gather woordes of Sentences. Hereof infinite contentions and errours doo daiely arise in Phisicke, in bothe Lawes, in Philosophie, in Diuinitee, and in other faculties of Learninge. For the Grammarians declare nothinge, but leane to authorities alone, whiche verie oftentimes are emonge them selues so variable, and disagreeinge, that it muste needes be, that moste of them are false: in whose preceptes who so doo greatly trushte, speake worste of al the reste, because that all the manner and force of speache is not in the Grammarians, but emonge the people, and getteth the vse of well speakinge by common custome: But after that the Barbarians began to haue the vpper hand, the purenesse of the Latine tongue ceased to be emong the people, notwithstandinge the rule thereof is not to be taken of Grammarians, but of subtantiall and learned writers, as of Cicero, Cato, Varro, bothe Plinies, Quintilian, Seneca, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Titus Liuius, Salust, and other like, emonge whome onely doo remaine the auntciente eloquence of the Latine tonge, adn the vse of well speaking, not emonge the lettered Grammarians, who with their rules of Declensons, of Uerbes & Cases, Compoundes, and Deponentes, doo muche abuse the Latine tonge, and oftentimes, inuent suche woordes, which are not lawefull for a Latinist to vse, excepte perchaunce a Sorbonist of Paris, recken it in the number of the Articles. If any fate, that credence is not to be geuen vnto the Grammarians, as to touchinge the veritie of the Latine tonge, and notwithstandinge these lettered Grammarians, make themselues onely correctours, iudges, and interpretours of all writers, and presume to set all Bookes in order, or to put them out of rule. There hath ben no Authoure, of so excellente a witte at any time, the whiche hath escaped the sclaunderous tongues of these men: whome haue they not reproued? or in whom haue they not blamed many thinges? In Plato, they reproue a confusion, and doo wante an order, of whose faultes Georgius Trapezuntius, hath written Bookes, who, as Crinitus saith, was therefore called of others, Conotimon his darkenes, and call him  Sepia. They reprehend Virgill, as one of little witte, and accuse him as a robber, and vsurper of other mens dooinges: Demosthenes did not contente Tullie, and that greate Rhetorician of the Latines, is by the Greekes, called into Iudgemente, to restore that, whiche he had wrongfully taken awaie, and he is accused for many faultes, as fearefull, superfluouse in his Repetitions, colde in his merie talke, slacke in his beginninges, iole in his digressions, seldome times inflamed, slowly vehemente, yee, and he is blamed of our men too, of Marcus Capella, as he that hath spoken in a troubled measure: Apollinaris blameth Lucilius for his vnordered Uerses. Plinie is saide, that in manner of a troubled Riuer, he heapeth togeather many thinges, without settinge any in order. Ouide is reported, to haue ouermuch followed his owne nature. Salust is reprehended of Asinius Pollio, for a curiouse counterfaitour. Terence is noted to haue stole, & recited other mens doinges, & to haue ben holpen of Labeo, and Scipio. Seneca was called Lime without Sande, whom Quintilian  14 partely he had not desired them, if he had not loued all his owne doinges, if he had not broken of the weightnesse of woordes with cutted sentences, Seneca should rather be alowed by the iudgement of learned men, then by the loue of children. Marcus Varro also, was called a Pigge: and Ambrose was termed a Dawe, and a teller of Fables. Macrobius, a very well learned man, was reproued of a shamelesse & vnthankful witte: Laurence Valla, the beste learned of al the Grammarians, did not spare any of them, that had written in Latine: and Mancinellus afterwarde inueyed againste him. There was in times paste, emonge the Grammarians, resisted againste him: finally, the later Grammarians, haue afterwarde reproued him as barbarous: So all the Grammarians are accustomed to striue one againste an other: Finally by the meanes of them it is brought to passe, that the translatio of the Holy Scripture, so many times chaunged, vnder the pretence of correction, dothe now, altogeather disagree from it self. Thorowe the censure of these men, so longe time men haue doubted of the Apocalipse of Sainete Iohn the Apostle, of the Epistle of Saincte Paule to the Hebrewes, of the Epistle of Iude, and of many other Chapiters of the Newe Lostamente: and which is more, they haue gone aboute to reduce the Gospel it selfe to questions, but let vs passe to the Poetes. little prowde in this thinge onlie, that in times paste, the Theaters, & Amphitheaters, the goodliest buildinges of men, were exected not by Philosophers, not by Lawiers, not by Phisitians, not by Rhetoritians, not by Mathematiciens, not by Diuines, but with exceading great expenses, by the fables of Poetes, an Arte, that was deuised to no other ende, but to please the ears of foolishe men, with wanton Rithmes, with measures, and weightinesee of sillables, and with a vaine iarringe of wordes, and to deceiue mens mindes with the delegation of fables, and with fardels of lies. Wherefore, shee dothe deserue to be called the principall Authoure of lies, and the maintanier of peruerse opinions: and as touchinge that whiche doth appertaine to furie, and drunckennesse, and to impudencie, & boldenesse, wee pardon it, what is he that is able to endure with a quiet minde, that vnfeareful boldenesse of lieinge: for what place wil shee leaue voide of peuishe trifles, and fables? Shee beginninge her fables with Chaos, doth recke the diuisions of the Heauens, the birthe of Venus, the sighte of the Titanes, the childhoode of Iupiter, the deceits of Rhea, and the supposition of the stone, the imprisonment of Saturnus, the rebellion of the Giauntes, the thefte and punishment of Prometheus, the errours of Delus, the labours of Latona, the death of Pitho, the wiles of Tyrus, the deluge of Deucalion, the birth of Men out of Stones, the dilantation of Bacchus, Bacchus, and what thinges so euer are declared in the Greeke fables of Minerua, Vulcane, Erichthonie, Borea, Orithia, Theseus, Egeus, Castor, Pollux, the wandringe of Ceres; Proferpina taken awaie by force, and founde againe, and what thinges soeuer are founde written of Minos, of Cadmus, Hercules, of the fighte of Sol and Neptunus, of the madnesse of Athamanthes, of Io transformed into a Cowe, and of Argus, her keaper, slaine by Mercurius, of the Golden fleese, of Peleus, Iason, medea, Danaes, Perseus, Gorgon, Cassiopea, Andromeda, Orpheus, Orestes, of the wandringes of Eneas, and Vlisses, of Circes, Thelagonius and Eolus, Palamedes, Nauplius, Aiax, Daphnes, Ariadna, Europa, Phedra, Pasiphaes, Dedalus, Iearus, Glaucus, Atlas, Gerion, Tantalus: of Pan: of the Cetaures, of the Satires: of the Sirenes: and of other suche notable lies. In the meane seson not content with earthlie thinges, finallie shee placeth the Goddes emonge her fables, and with venemous eloquence of wordes, and with pestiferous pleasauntnesse of verse, writing of their natiuities, their deathes, their contentions, their brawlinges, theire hatred, theire anger, theire fighte, theire woundes, their lamentations, their imprisonment, their loues, their bawdie practises, theire luxuriousnesse, their fornications, their aduouterie, their accompaniyng with men and beastes, & worse then these, if any maie be more shameful and dishonest, dothe not onlie deceiue & infecte them which then liued, but dothe moreouer make the posteritie parttaker of these furious venims, preserued in goodlie verses, & meters, & who so euer shee shal once infecte with her doctrine & lies, she costraineth to rage with the like woodnesse, as it were with the bitinge of a madde dogge. For her lies are fained with so greate skill, that oftentimes they hinder true histories, euen as the mater is manifest, by the fained adulterie of Dido with Eneas, and Troye taken by the Gretians. There are yet some, whiche haue come to so greate furie of maddenesse, that they beleue that they haue in them certaine diuine Oracles, because in times paste Sprites gaue answeare in 15 Poetical verses, for that cause they call them Prophetes and Poetes, inspired with the diuine Spirite, and do vse the triflinge verses of Poetes & Oracles to diuine. For that cause the Auncietes surnamed Homer his Oracles, of the verses of Homer, as of Virgil his verses, the Oracles of Uigil, of whiche Spartian maketh mention in the life of Adrian. The whiche superstition at this daie is transferred to the Holy Scriptures, and to the verses of the Psalmes, not without the consente and agreemente of many greate Doctours. But let vs retonrne to Poetrie: Augustine willeth that it shoulde be banished out 16 Weale. Cicero forbiddeth it to be admitted. Socrates admonisheth, that if any man be very careful of his Honoure, and desireth to saue it harmelesse, let him foresee ye he haue no Poete his enemie, because they haue not so greate force in praisinge as in dispraisinge, & ill speakinge. The moste rightuouse Kinge Minos, renowmed of Hesiodus and Homer, incensed the tragical Poetes againste him, whiche bannished him to Hell, because certaine of her louers. The Poete Ennius settinge out the deedes of Scipio, was the first that fainted Dido, the first buildresse of Carthage, a verie chaste widowe, to haue ben enamoured of Eneas: the whiche yet according to the reckening of times, could neuer haue seene him: whiche lie, Virgil did afterwarde so beautifie, that it was beleued for a true historie. In the ende this libertie of lieing, and lewdnesse of ill speakinge, came to this passe, that it was necessarie for the Censours to make a Lawe, whereby suche reproche and lies of Poetes might be repressed. But emonge ye aunciente Romaines also, Poetrie was publikelie had in dishonoure: and in suche sorte, that as Gelius and Cato witnesse, he that studied therein, was called a common murderer, and moreouer Quintus Fuluius was therefore reproued of Marcus Cato, because he beinge sente Proconful Iustinian iudged not the professours thereof woorthie to haue anie franches. The Athenians moreouer, codemned Homer in fiftie grotes, as a madde man, who is called the Philosopher of all Poetes, and the Poete of all Philosophers: and they laughed to skoine the Poete Tichteus as a man of a weake witte: and moreouer the Lacedemonians commauded the bookes of Archilochus the Poete to be caried out of their Citie. In this manner, all vertuouse men haue dispised Poetrie, as the mother of lies, seeinge that the Poetes doo lie so monstrously: as them that haue spente theire studie not to speake, nor write any good thinge: but with bodged verses to delite the eares of fooles, and to make a clatteringe noise with the craftie coueringe of fables, and disceitefullie to deuise all thinges vpon a matter of nothinge, as Campanus wrote in a certaine place. The peuishe Poetes pine awaie, If that theire triflinge toies decaie, For Verses are vnto them foode, Lies are to these both golde and good, And what they liste, they speake and faine They thinke it to theire praise a staine If on true tales they beate theire braine. There are moreouer most greeuous contentions emong Poetes, not onlie for the Carracter of the verse, for the feete, for the accentes, and quantities of sillables, for al the common sorte of Grammarians doo contend for these thinges, but also for these theire trifles, faininges, and lies, that is, for the knot of Hercules, for the Chaste tree, for the letters of Hiacinthus, for the children of Niobes, for the trees, vnder whiche Latona broughte foorthe Diana. In like manner for the Countrie of Homer, and for his Sepulture, and whether Homer and Hesiodus were firste, whether Patroclus were before Achilles, in what state of bodie Anacharsis Scitha did sleepe: whye Homer did not giue honoure to Palamedes in his verses: whether Lucanus is to be reckened in the number of Poetes, or Historiographers: of the rubberie of Virgil, and in what moneth of the yeere he died. And who did firste inuente the doleful songes The lettered sorte incessauntlioe contende, And yet the matter dooth on iudge depende. All the verses of Poetes are full of fables, written to no other ende, but to the delite of fooles, vnder colour of flatterie, or reproufe of the vilest Uices. What thinges soeuer Poetes declare, praise, inuocate, and flatter with their fables. They doo againe reproue, bite, accuse and raile with theire fables, and are alwaies madde. Worthely therefore Democritus termeth this, no Arte, but a madnesse. And the opinion of Plato is, that he, that is wel in his wittes, knocketh in vaine at the doore of Poetrie. Then Poetes write marueilous thinges, when they are mad or droncke. For this cause Augustine slender, and bare Arte whiche of it selfe is altogeather a foolishe thinge, excepte it be attired and sauoured with some other Discipline. An Arte that is alwaies hungrie, and eatinge vp other mens breade like mise: and yet I wote not what immortall glorie of name, it presumeth to promise emonge trifles, and fables, with the Grashopers of Tithones, with the Frogges of the Licians, and with the pismers of Mirmidones, and saye, Leade ye a happie life, & if my verse maie ought auaile No time with vile obliuion hal euer you assaile. Whiche fame in deede is either none or nothinge auailinge. But the historians teache, that this is theire office, and not of Poetes. 17 An Historie is a declaration of thinges done with praise, or dispraise, whiche, as it were in a certaine liuely picture, doth set before our cies ye Cousailes, Deedes, & Endes of great things, ye Enterprises of Princes, and Noblemenne, with the order, and discription of times, and places: and therefore all menne, for the moste parte, calle it the Mistresse of life, and verie profitable to the framinge thereof, because that with the examples of many thinges, shee doothe partelye enflame moste excellente menne, for the immortal glorie of praise and renowme, to all woorthye enterprises, partely, because for feare of perpetual infamie, shee letteth all wicked and naughty men from misdooinge: albeit this thinge oftentimes hathe chaunced otherwise: and many, (as Liuie writeth, of Manlius Capitolinus) had leiser haue a great, then a good fame: and many menne, because by their vertue, they cannot be knowen, they will for theire mischeiuous deedes be remembred and written in Histories, euen as Iustine recordethe of Trogus, of Pausanias Macedonian famous for the murder of Kinge Phillippe, and as Gellius, Valerius, and Solinus made relation of Herostratus, who burned the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, the goodliest worke that in two hundred yeeres before was builte in all Asia. And although it was prouided with moste extreme Lawes, that nowe should name this man in worde or writinge, notwithstandinge, he obteined the ende, for the whiche he had committed so greate offence: the fame and name of him beinge broughte thorowe so manye hundrethe yeeres, vnto oure age: but lette vs retourne to an Historie. This Arte, albeit to doothe chiefely require an Order, Agreemente, and Truthe of all thinges: notwithstanding, it perfourmeth it leaste of all. Historiographers doo so mutche disagree emonge themselues, and doo write so variabe and diuers thinges of one matter, that it is impossible, but that a number of them shoulde be verie Liers, I speake not onlie of the beginninge of the Worlde, of the Uniuersall Floude, of the buildinge of Rome: of the whiche beginninges they professe the selues to write of thinges which were donne, for so much as the first of these, all men be ignorante of, the other al men wil not beleue, the thirde is vncertaine emonge them. Wherefore sithe these thinges be very farre of, neither allowed of all men with an vpright consideratio, let vs forgeue the their errours. But as touching these latter times, the faulte of livinge muste needes be imputed to them: and so great occasions thereof are the multitude of discordaunces. For the moste parte of menne, because they were not presente 18 in the times, in the places, with the personnes, and at the dooinges of the thinges recited, gatheringe in one the comunication of the people, by ye relation of another, doo write no certaine & stable thing: of which vies Erstaotheus, Metrodorus, Septius, Possidonius, & Patrocles ye Gee ographer, are reproued of Strabo. There be some other, which whe they haue seene parte of thinges, as by passing in an armye, or begginge vnder pretence of praier, or pilgrimage from one Hospitall to an other, trauelinge thorowe countries doo rashly presume to write an Historie: suche a one as Onosicritus, and Aristobolus, in time 19 and pleasure, doo enterlase lies with true matters, oftentimes also ommittinge the truthe: for which vice Diodorus Siculus, dothe reproue Heredotus: Danudes, and Philostratus. There are also some, which turne true thinges to Fables, as Gnidius, Cresias, Hecatoeus, and many other aunciente Historians: There are many, that impudently & shamefully auaunt themselues to professe Historiographie: that they may not seeme to be ignoraunt in any thinge, or to haue taken oute of others some other thinge, whilest with a nouitee or straungnesse full of trifles, they haue presumed to write of vnknowen countries, & vnable to be gone vnto, haue spoken of nothinge but trimme trifles, and monstruous lies. Euen as the Fables be, that are reade of the Arimaspi, of the Gripes, of the Pigm aei, and the Cranes, and of the Cinocephali, and Astromori: of the Hippodes, of the Phannisij, and of the Trogletyti, to whose erronte they are next that affirme the frosen Sea to be vnder the Articke, and yet they finde foolishe men, and withoute iudgemente, that beleue them in suche thinges, and accompte 20 there was one onely Citie in Iberia, knowinge that they doo inhabite so greate a parte of Spaine. And Stephanos the Greeke, whiche saide, that the people called Franci, were Italians, and that Vienna was a Cittie of Galilea, for Galatia. And Arriauns the Greeke, which affirmed that the standinge of Germanie, was not farre from the Ionike Sea, to whome agreeth Dionisius also in the thinges whiche are falsely writen Cornelius Tacitus, Marcellus, Orosius and Blondus, doo speake of the places of Germanie, for the moste parte they are farre from the truthe. Likewise Strabo falsely writeth that the Riuer Ister, that is, Danubius, springeth not farre from the Sea Adriatike: and Herodotus people Celti, the whiche are they fardest people of Europe, and entreth into Scithia. And againe, Strabo saithe, that the Riuers Lapus, and Visurgus, doo runne into the Riuer Hanasus, whereas Lapus is mingled with the Rhene, and Visurgus, is discharged in the Oceane Sea: So Plinie also teacheth that the riuer Mosa Ocean but in the Rhene. With the like errours emong the latter Historians, and Geographers, Sabellicus falsly woulde haue the people called Alani, to take their beginninge of the Almans, and the Hungarians, of the people Huni, moreouer he termeth the Gothes, and the Getes Scithians, and confoundeth the Danes, with the people Daci, and placeth the hill of Saincte Ottilia, in Bauaria, whereas it is not farre from the Cittie Argentine. Volaterranus also confoundeth Austerania, and Austria, the Auarians and Bauarians: Lucerna the Barnensian Swisers, whereas they longe time after tooke theire beginnings of Bartholdus Duke of the Zaringians: Semblablely, Conrades Celtes supposeth the people Daci, to be one with the Cimbrians, that is the Fleminges, and the Cherusci, to be them which wee call Cerusci, and moreouer he saithe that the Mountaines Ryphei, are in Sarmatia, at this daie Poland, and writeth that the gumme called Amber, groweth out of a tree. There are moreouer other emonge the Historians, giltie of greater lies, who when they were presente at the thinges, or knew them otherwise then they are, or were done, notwithstanding ouercome with beneuolence and affection, flatteringe theire owne doinges, doo preferre falshoode before the truthe. Emonge these are some, whiche takinge in hande to write Histories, to accuse or defende other mens causes, writtig suche thinges only, whiche make for theire purpose, dissemblinge, ouer passinge, or diminishinge the residewe: doo write corrupte and vnperfecte Histories, for whiche vice Blondus dothe reproue Orosius, because he hath kepte silente that great 21 ruine of  Italie, wherein the Gothes ransacked Rauenna, Candanum, Aquileia, Ferraria, and in a manner at Italie, that he might not debase his enterprised mattier. There are moreouer many, whiche corrupted thorowe feare, rancoure, or with hatred of some, doo write vntruthes: Others, whilest they desire to extol there owne doinges, doo diminishe other mens prowesse, and write that which is not, but that which they couet, that which they wishe, and that which pleaseth them, stedfastly trustinge that they will not faile to be companions and defendours of theire lies, and be their witnesses, whome they haue notable flattered. Whiche vice in times paste was comon 22 emonge the Greeke writers: but at this daie well neare the Historians of all Nations haue the same vice: as  Sabellicus, and Blondus, In the affaires of the Venetians. Paulus Emilius, and Ganguinus, in the exploites of the Frenche men, whiche Princes entertaine for no other commoditie, but that as Plutarch saithe, because they by the meanes of a good witte, chokinge vertue with other mens merites, accordinge to the maiestrie of an Historie, with trifles and faininges may sette out theire deedes. After this sorte the Greeke Historiographers writinge of the inuentours of thinges, would attribute al thinges to themselves, but they were not theirs. Beholde another 23 moste corrupte kinde of flatterere, whiche whilest they goo aboute to enlarge and extende, the beginninge  of their Princes, to the moste Auncient Kinges of the they haue recourse to Fables, and strange beginninges, and faine names of Kinges, and places, and there is nothinge, wherof they make not a lie. Of this sorte, is that barbarous Hunibaldus, who, writtinge the Historie of the people Franci, hath deuised Scithia, Sicambria, the yonger Priamus, and other names of Places & Kinges, of whiche no auncient Historian euer made mention: and notwithstandinge, men of like witte, haue followed his trifles: as, Gregorius Turonensis, Rheginus, and Sigisbertus, with many other. Of this kinde is Vitelkindus also, who saith, that the Saxons, the Auncientest and firste inhabitours of Germanie, weare ofspringe of the Macedonians, and dothe deriue them from the remnaunte of Alexander the Greate, whiche hathe in this erroure many other companions. There be moreouer many, whiche write Histories, not so mutche to tell the Truthe, as to delite that thei maie expresse, and depainte, the Image of a noble Prince, in whom they please. Whiche if any shal reproue for liynge, they saie, that they haue not so greate a regarde, to thinges done, as to the profite of the posteritee, and to the faine of witte, and therefore they haue not declared all thinges, as they haue benne donne, but how they ought to be declared, and that obstinately, they will not defende the truthe, but where the commo vtilitee dothe require, either a faininge or vntruthe, citinge Fabius for witnesse, who saithe, that suche a lie is not to be dispised, whiche auaileth to the persuasion of honestie. Furthermore, seinge that they write to the posteritie, it maketh no greate matter, with what name, or what order the example of a good Prince shoulde be published abroade: Such an example hath Xenophon sette out of Cyrus, not as it was, but as it ought to be, as a resemblance and paterne, of a singular good Prince, writinge a proper and trimme Historie, but without truthe. Hereof at length it is come to passe, that many apte to lyinge by nature and industrie, haue writen sained Histories: as are the follies of Morgan, Margalon, Melusin, Amadis, Florando, Tirante, Couamor, Arthur, Diether, Lancelot, Tristan, I meane those sained and foolishe dotages of Poetes, more fained and fabulouse, then Comedies or Fables: emonge the learned sorte Apuleius, and Lucianus, are cheife in these thinges: moreouer as Cicero saithe, in Herodotus, the father of Histories, in Diodorus, and Theopompus, the infinite fables, & stuffed full of lies: for we reade in them that the riuers were drunke by the Medes, and that men might sayle ouer the hill Athos. And what soeuer lyinge Greece , Doth dare to write in Histories. And these be the causes, why in no parte any credite may be throughly geue to Histories: although we chiefly seeke this in it, it is a very harde matter to attaine to Iudgement, which should be needeful in discerning the truthe, for so much as they wrote not publikely of thinges that happened, whiche declared the truthe of thinges, & stopped the mouthes of Liers, but euerie one was suffered to vse his owne opinion. Hereof they haue gotten Authoritie to erre, and lie: whereupon emonge the Historiographers there is risen so greate a discorde, that, as Iosephus saithe againste Appio, they reproue one another with theire Bookes, and write verie diuersly of one selfe thinge. In howe many places, (saithe he) is Hellanicus repugnante to Agesilaus as touchinge Genealogie or Pedegrue, and in how many thinges dothe Agesilaus that Hellanicus is a lier: Timeus reproueth Ephorus, they whiche were after Timeus reproued him, and all men in generall reproue Herodotus. But Timeus hath vouchesaued to agree with Antiochus, Philisto, and Gallia in euerie thinge: in many thinges moreouer is Thucidides accused as deceitful, although he Historiographers write many thinges, but all not to be alowed, and there are some, whiche alowe thinges, not to be alowed, many doo determine to followe very naughtie examples. For they whiche with wonderfull praises doo depainte Hercules, Achilles, Hector, Theseus, Epaminondas, Lizander, Themistocles, Xerxes, Cyrus, Darius, Alexander, Pirrhus, Hannibal, Scipio, Pompei, C aesar, what other haue they described but greate and furiouse theeues, & famouse spoilers of the worlde? I confesse that they were very good Capitanes, doubtles very wicked and naughtie men. But if a man saie to me that by the reading of Histories a singular wisedome maie be gotten, I denie it not, so that he also graunte me this, that out of the same is receaued in like manner greate domage: and as Martial faithe, There are many thinges good, many indifferent, and many naught. to these, be an Arte, or not, and the matter is yet before the Iudge. For Socrates in Plato dothe proue with very stronge reasons, that it is neither Arte, neither Science, but a certaine subtiltie and sharpnesse of witte, and that it is neither commendable, nor honest, but rather a dishonest, and seruile slatterie. Lisias moreouer and Cleanthes, and Menedemus in any Arte, but that it proceedeth onely of nature, whiche teacheth euery man when he shoulde flatter, and tell his owne matters, and to strengthen it with argumentes: and that true pronuntiation, memorie, and the finest manner of inuention did proccede of nothinge els Oratours. Besides this although before Tisias, Corax and Gorgias, none did teache or write the 26 Arte of Rhetoricke, there were notwithstandinge many  very wise and eloquente men. And furthermore where as the Arte is defined to be a collectio of preceptes, which tende to one ende: the Rhetoritians, striue vnto this howre what the ende thereof is, whether to persuade, or so speake well, and not contente with the true causes doo deuise newe and fained. They haue besides this founde out so many Theses, Hypotheses, figures, colours, guidinges, carracters, persuations, controuersies, declamations, prodems, insinuations, gettinges of good will, and moste artificiall narrations, that vnneth they can be numbred, and notwithstandinge they denie that there is 27 an ende of  Rhetorike. This Arte the Lacedemonians did vtterly reiecte, whiche saide that honest mens communication ought not to proceede of arte, but of the harte. The auncient Romaines moreouer did very late receiue Rhetoritians into the Cittie: and although after muche disputation Cicero had gone aboute to shewe that Oratorie did not so mutche proceede of arte, as of wisedome, and therefore had writen the woorke of a perfecte Oratoure, notwithstandinge that Oratoure whiche he as an example or paterne there frameth, is not allowed of all men, and moreouer he seemeth to be very mutche suspected of Brutus a man of singular honestie, & alwaies the opinion  28 of Rhetoritians hath taken place, that the preceptes of pleading doo more hurte, then profite the life of men: and  to speake the truthe, it is cleare that al the whole doctrine of Rhetoricke is nothinge els, but the arte of fauninge flatterie, and as some more boldely speake of lyinge, to the ende that that whiche he cannot bringe to effect, with the veritie of the matter, he may persuade with the painted glosse of talke: euen as Archidamus beinge demaunded, whether he were stronger then him: he aunswered. Although Pericles be ouercome by me in battaile, 29 notwithstandinge he hath so muche eloquence, that when he reasoneth of these things, he appeareth not conquered but conquerour: and Plinie faithe of Carneades, that when he argued, the truthe coulde hardly be perceaued: and of the same it is written, that when on a time he had spoken many thinges wisely and eloquently, before the people in the fauoure of Iustice, the nexte daie followinge with no lesse eloquence and learninge he inueighed againste Iustice. There was in Siracusa Corax  30 this arte for rewarde. Unto him came Tisias, and hauinge no readie monie to paye him, he promised him double assone as he had taught him Rhetoricke, whom Corax with that condition receaued and taughte. Tisias, when he had learned this Arte, goinge aboute to beguile his master of the monie, he asked Corax, what Rhetoricke was, who when he had aunsweared that it was the maistresse of persuations, he made an argument in this manner against his maister. Whatsoeuer then I shall tell thee touchinge the monie, if I shal persuade that I owe thee nothinge, I owe thee nothinge, because I haue persuaded that I owe nothinge: if I can not persuade thee, I wil not be indebted to thee, because thou haste not taught me to perswade: Then Corax shall saie touchinge the monie, if I shall perswade that 31 I oughte to haue it, I shall receaue it, because I haue perswaded thee: if I shal not perswade thee, I ought to receaue it, because I haue taught so greate a scholler, that  ouercame his maister. The Siracusans hearinge them contende with argumentes, whiche they were able to tourne to euery purpose, exclamed: Of a naughty crowe, a naughty egge: signifiynge that a naughty maister had made a worse Scholler. Gellius recompteth an Historie his Scholer. Notwithstandinge to knowe how to speake perfectly, eloquently, grauely, and plentifully, is alwaies a goodly, delectable, and a profitable thinge, sometimes for al that dishonest, and vnconuenient, and very often daungerous, and alwaies suspected: Wherefore Socrates thinketh Rhetorians are woorthy of no estimation, and that they should beare no rule in a wel framed common weale. And Plato thinketh good that they should be kept out of the Publike weale, togeather with the makers of Tragedies, stage plaiers, and Poetes, and not without a cause. For there is nothinge more daungerous to ciuill offices then this, from whiche corrupted accusers, hafters, sicophantes, and suche other names of a naughty tounge doo descende: For oftentimes men indewed with this arte doo moue conspiracie, and stirre sedition, whilest they with this artificial bablinge deceaue some, backebite other, ieste at other, flatter other, and vse a certaine tirannie againste innocentes. Therefore Euripides saide well, that to knowe how to speake many thinges was a certaine tirannouse thinge: and Eschilus saithe, that wel ordered communications, is the fowlest mischiefe of al others. Raphael Volaterranus a man very studiouse in Histories & examples, confesseth, that when he had conferred togeather al the examples, which he had harde and reade of the auncientes, and of them of latter time, he founde very fewe good men eloquente. Haue  32 there not bene great common wealthes greeuously vexed  by this onely, and oftentimes brought to vtter decaie The Bruti, the Cassij, the Gracchi, Cato, Cicero, and Demosthenes, are examples hereof, whiche as they were accompted of all men the moste eloquent, so alwaies of all men they were moste seditious. For Cato Censorius, beinge accused fourtie times, did accuse ether more then seuentie times, greatly troubling al his life time the tranquilitie of the common wealth with his peeuish declamations. subuerte the Romaine libertie. No lesse did Cicero incense Anthonie to the destruction of the publike wealthe, and Demosthenes, Philippe to the ruine of the Athenians: in fine there was no state of common wealthe, whiche hath not in times paste bene turned vpside downe by this Arte, none hath escaped vcnhurte with the vice of Eloquence, if he hath geuen eare thereto. In likewise confidence in Eloquence can doo much in iudgementes, her patronage defendeth vniuste causes, and he that is giltie is deliuered from the daunger of the lawe, & the accused innocent is oftentimes condemned by her: and there was neuer any so defended by this Arte, but that he whiche was on the contrary parte had the soile. Marcus Cato the wisest of the Romaines did forbid these three Oratours of the Athenians, that is, Carneades, Critholaus, and Diogenes, to be receaued into the Cittie of Rome, and there openly to teache, because they had so sharpe wittes, suche pleasaunt speache, and passing Eloquence, that they coulde easily perswade righteous, and vnrighteous causes. It is wel knowen that Demosthenes in times past did auaunte hereof emong his friendes, that he coulde, when he listed, drawe the minde of the Iudges whether pleased him by the craftie conueyaunce of his comunication, accordinge to whose fantasie the Athenians, force of Eloquence to moue and mitigate the affections of the minde, that as it were hauinge rule ouer his Countrie men, he would drawe them whether he listed with woordes: for the like cause Cicero was at Rome called of many a Kinge, bicause that he drewe the Senate whether he would with woordes, rulinge al thinges with his Eloquence. Hereby it appeareth that Rhetoricke is nothinge els, but an Arte of perswading and mouinge the affections, with subtile eloquence, with exquisite colouringe of woordes, and with a false likelihoode of the truth doth allure the mindes of the simple, and leadeth them into the prison of erroure, seekinge to subuerte the sence of the truthe. But if by the meanes of nature there is nothinge, whiche maye not be expressed with true woordes, what can be more pestilent, then to studie for coloured woordes. The speache of the truthe is simple, liuely, percinge, and a searcher of the inwarde intentions of the harte, and like a hatchet & twoo handed sworde dothe seperate and cut a sunder al the Artificial  33 argumentes of Oratours. For this cause  Demosthenes without any doubte despised all other Rhetoricians, and feared Phocion alone who simplely and briefly spake the truthe, and suche thinges as appertained to the purpose. Peraduenture the auncient Romaines knewe this, whiche (as Suetonius testifieth) with a publike edicte did twise driue the Rhetoricians out of ye Citie of Rome, once when Caius Fannius Strabo, and Marcus Valerius Messala were consuls: once againe, when Cneius Domitius Enobarbas, & Lucius Licinius Crassus were censours: the thirde time, when Domitianus was Emperoure by a generall decree of the Senate they were bannished from Rome, and out of Italie. The Athenians did forbidde them the place of iudgement as destroiers of Iustice: and they caused Timagoras to be beheaded, because in doinge the duties of salutation, according to the custome of that nation he had flattered Kinge Darius. The Lacedemonians  34 whole date of any thinge. For there was nothinge more odious emonge them, then this curious cunninge of theire tongue, whiche had no care to speake the truthe: but takinge in hande a meane matter, did trimely attire it with exquisite elegancie of speache, and with loftinesse of woordes, and to deceaue the mindes of the hearers with pleasauntnesse of woordes, & with their tongue to leade them bonde by the eares. And now it is euidente that none are made better by this skill, but that very many are made woorse: which albeit they were able to speake cleanlier of vertues, yet wee see them much better spoken, and of a more flowinge Eloquence to defende erroures, to sowe debates, to stirre vp seditions, to taunte, to backerite, to accuse falslie, then to seeke peace, concorde, and quietnesse: and to preache Charitie, Faith, and Religion. Furthermore very many cleauinge to this skill, haue swarued from the true faithe: and Sectes, Schismes, Superstitions, and Heresies haue spronge vp whilest that some in such sorte despise the holy Scripture bicause it wanteth Ciceros Eloquence, that otherwhiles with polished perswations of Pagane argumentes they helde againste the Catholike truthe. Which is manifestly seene in the Tacian Heretikes, and in them, whiche Libanius the Sophist, and Symmachus the Oratoure defenders of Idolatrie, Celsus Africanus, and Iulianus Apostata haue seduced, rising vp against Christ with most great colours of Rhetoricke: out of whose damnable and blasphemous Eloquence, the Heretikes haue taken many argumentes of perswations, whiche they putting into to simple mens cares, haue ledde them from the woorde of Truthe. But what stande we aboute the Cramples of aunciente Heretikes: let vs beholde our times. Who be the ringe leaders of the Germane Heresies, whiche takinge beginning of Luther alone are at this daie so much encreased, that wel neare euery Citie hath his peculiare Heresie? are not the authours of them moste eloquente men, armed with Eloquence of the tonge, and with the elegancie of stile? and whom a fewe yeares past we haue seene to be so muche praised for the perfecte knowledge of the tongues, for the finenesse of speache & for the promptnes of speakinge and writinge, that nothinge coulde be added to theire praises, at this daie we see the heades and capitaines of Heretikes: so there be many vntill this daie, whiche geuen to Eloquence, whilest that they are desirous to be Ciceronians, are made Pagans, and they superstitious, & these wicked. And al they whiche contrary to the simple woordes of the truthe doo pore idle talke into mens cares, they shal stande in iudgemente, and render an accompte of suche thinges as they haue vainely faigned adn deuised againste God. Logike is ioygned to these for a succour, and verely it is nothinge els, but a skilfulnes of contention and darkenesse, by the whiche al other sciences are made more obscure, and harder to learne, and shee more ouer termeth her selfe Logike, that is, the science of speakinge 35 and reasoninge. Miserable doubtlesse and vnreasonable  should mankinde be, if without this learninge it shoulde not know how to reason: notwithstandinge Seruius Sulpitius saide, that this was the greatest of all Artes, and as it were a lighte vnto suche thinges as are taught to others, whereas shee (as Cicero saithe) dothe teache; howe 36 to deuide all the whole matter into partes, and by defininge to declare that whiche is hidde, by interpretinge to make plaine that whiche is obscure, to skan and distinguishe that whiche is doubtefull: & shee dothe geue rules to iudge true thinges and false. Moreouer the Logitioners promisse (as they saie) that thy are able to finde out the essential definition of euery thinge: notwithstanding they can neuer make it plaine with any woordes, but that the minde is as ignoraunt as it was before. But if any saie to an vnlearned man, a mortall liuing creature reasonable, for a man, he will lesse vnderstande it, then if he had saide simplely a man. Boetius amonge the Latines hath writen muche of this, whose workes are not extant, but that whiche Aristotle of interpretation, others: whom the Peripatetickes followinge, doo suppose that nothinge can stande, or be vnderstoode excepte it be proued with perfecte argument by demonstration, to weete, that whiche Aristotle setteth out, but yet he neuer obserued it in his determinate opinions, for so muche as he hath taken all his argumentes of presupposed matters, whome all these professours of Sciences followinge haue not hitherto geuen any, or very fewe true demonstrations in other matters, nor yet in natural thinges, but all deriue them from preceptes, or from their Aristotle, or from some other, that spoke them before him, whose authoritie thei kepe to them selues, for principles of demonstration, Aristotle teacheth that the true demonstration, which ought to make knowledge, is that, whiche is made (as the Logitioners speake) by Quiddites, and by the proper difference of thinges hidden, and vnknowen to vs. He saithe moreouer that demonstration is made of causes, of these whiche are as, of, by, it selfe, and after as the thinge is: whiche prepositions albeit they are conuertible addinge them selues togeather, not withstandinge he saithe that there is no circular demonstration geuen, nor graunted of the causes. Yf therefore the principles of demonstration be very ill vnderstoode, and the circumstance shal not be admitted, certes hereof can be had none but very sclender adn vncertaine knowledge: For wee must beleue thinges shewed, by certaine weake principles: to the whiche wee agree either for the forepassed authoritee of the wise, as it were to knowen limetes, or els with experience we allowe them by the senses. For euery knowledge (as they saie) hath his beginning of the senses, and the proufe of true speaches (as Auerrois saithe) is that they agree with sensible thinges. And that thing is better knowen and truer, whereupon moste mindes and senses doo agree: thorowe the knowledge then of sensible thinges wee are ledde by the hande to al suche thinges, that maie be knowen by vs. But sithe that oftentimes all the senses are deceaued, doubtlesse they cannot proue to vs any certaine experience. Furthermore sithe that the senses cannot attaine to the intellectuall nature, and the causes of the inferiour things, of whiche theire natures, effectes, and properties or rather passions should be declared, by the consent of al men be altogeather vnknowen to our senses, is it not manifest that the waie of the truth is shutte vp froo the senses? Wherefore al these deriuations and sciences, whiche are faste rooted in the senses shalbe vncertaine, erroneous, & deceiptful: What then is the profitte of Logike, and what fruite cometh of that learned demonstration, by principles & proufes, to the whiche we shal of necessitie assente as it were to knowen limites: shall not now the principles theselues, & proufes rather be knowen then shewed? but I wil now repeate this Arte more at largo. The Logitioners setlinge, apparalinge, action,  & passion, in the which they thinke that al thinges are contained, and vnderstoode whatsoeuer is compreheded in all the vniuersall rounde worlde. Moreouer they teache what they be that are before spoken of these and their partes, whiche be fiue in number: that is, the Generall woorde, the Speciall, the Difference, the Propertie, Formal, Efficient, & Final, by the which they suppose that they can finde out the truthe, and falsehoode of al things, by a certaine infallible Demonstration (as they thinke,) that is, with a Syllogisme, that is, a perfecte argumente, whiche ought to be in one of the. xix. Moodes of figures (as they terme it) with one of the three Moodes. They make euery Syllogisme or Demonstration with three limites, whiche be, the Subiect sought, and is called the Larger, the thirde is the Meane, whiche taketh parte of bothe: and accordinge to these thei frame twoo Propositions, finally ariseth the conclusion, that is, passinge from one extreame to an other, as it were from the entraunce to the bowndes. This is all that marueilous cunninge, these be al the extreame borders thereof, by the whiche they suppose to ioygne, deuide, and conclude al thinges by certaine conclusions, whiche they thinke impossible to be disproued, and these are the highe and marueilous misteries of Logike, founde out with greate laboure by deceiptfull Maisters, whiche as it were certaine hidden a secrete thinges all maie not professe nor learne, but suche as can geue great rewardes for the hauing of them, and haue bought this authoritie emonge Scholers with greate expenses. Finally these are theire dogges, these are their nettes, by the whiche (as they thinke) they trace out the truthe of all thinges either subiecte to nature as naturall thinges, or accompanyinge nature as the Mathematicalles, or that in a certaine sorte surpasse nature it selfe, as are the supernaturall thinges: whiche truthe not withstandinge thorowe that cunninge, accordinge to the Prouerbe of P. Clodius, and Varro, they loste with tomuche disputation. And these onely are the limites of the auncient Logitioners. But many more monsters, and greater miracles then these, hath the latter Schole of the Sophistes added 37 Coparatiues, of Superlatiues, of the Difference of one, of the Beginninge, and of the Ende, of Formalities, of Seccietes, of Instaunces, of Ampliations, of Restrictions, of Distributions, of Intentions, of Suppositions, of Appellations, Exponibles, of Reduplicatiues, of Exclusiues, of Instances, of Cases, of Particularifications, of Supposites, of Mediations, intollerable, & vaine woordes which are writen in the little Logicals, with the whiche all thinges whiche in very deede are false, and impossible, they will easily proue to be true: and contrariwise what thinges so euer are true, as breaking out of the Troiane horse, they wil sodenly spoile with firte blastes & thundring of woordes by the meanes of these engins. There are againe other, whiche allowe but three Predicamentes, and two Figures at Moodall propositions, and at the Concrete and Abstract termes: and there be founde some whiche adde the eleuenth Predicament, and the fourth Figure of Syllogismes, and doo augmente the number of the Predicables and Causes, and haue brought in so many inuincible and Scotical subtilities, that the sharpe and shrewde sayinges of Cleanthes, Eutidemus, and Dionisiodorus, shall be altogeather block; she and rusticall, if they be compared with the newe inuentions of our Sophisters, in the which vniuersally at this daie well neare all the companie of Scholers, beinge occupied in a nuserable and damnable studie, seeme to doo nothinge more then to learne to erre, and with vnceasing contention, either to make the truth more obscure, or vtterly to loose it: al whose learninge is nothinge els but a certaine captiousnesse, whiche thorow a corrupte speakinge of woordes with a certaine subtile cauillation subuerteth the vse of speakinge, and offereth violence to the tonge, which shee vnderstandeth not, turninge the truthe vpside downe after a likely exposition, whose glorie is placed in nothinge els but tauntes and crakinges, as they that doo not desire so muche to ouercome, as to fighte, and theire intente is not to finde out the truthe, but to brawle, in so muche that he is accoumpted the chiefest emonge them: that crieth lowdest, that is moste shamelesse, and prateth apace. Of whiche Petrarcha saithe, that this procedeth from the vnshamefulnes of writinge, or from the confession of ignorance, they cannot refraine their tonge, they contende not with the penne, thei wil not haue seene, how weake the things are, wherewith they set out themselues, and therfore accordinge 38 to the vse of the  Parthians they fighte flyinge awaie, & vtteringe windie woordes, doo as it were spreade saile. These be they which Quintilian termeth very craftie in disputations: but when they goe from that cauillation, they are nomore sufficient in any weighty matter, then certaine small wormes or beastes, whiche able to stirre in straight places, are taken abroade in the fielde: and therefore they feare to come into the open fielde: and this is true, that priuie places, and narrowe corners be healpers to weakenese, because thei which cannot runne, maie turne and winde whether they liste. In like manner doo the Sophisters feare to fighte vnder notaries with Bookes, and Authours in theire hande: but they will contende with the onely force of memorie, and with the flittinge cries of the tongue, not to the ende thei maie be put in writinge as thinges good, and auaileable, but that they maie passe in at one eare, and out at the other: and doo thinke, that it maketh no matter, what reason euery one vseth, so that he geue an instaunce, and some reason to the contrary, and that it is not to be regarded what so euer he speaketh, or thinketh, so that he speake & brawle apace: for the more woordes a man vseth, the better learned he is iudged emonge them. They with these illusions, and deceites goe aboute to Scholes, to streates, to tables, to seeke suche as are of theire profession, whiche they bidde, praie, and procure to dispute, and if they encounter and bige one an other, they go to priuie places. and seeke out corners, and repaire estsoones to their vsual matters, makinge so many turninges, as if they shoulde go aboute a Laberinth: And if any be lothe & vnwillinge to contende with them, they assaile him with some subtile question, whiche a very well learned man hath not founde out, that in suche sorte they maie either conuince him in an erroure, that answeareth vnprouided, or if he saie that he is not able to answeare to theire demaunde, they put him to shame, and hisse at him, and so they on bothe partes appeare to be learned. But let vs see, what fruite Logike with her Sophisters hathe brought foorthe, and bringeth foorth in the Churche of Christe, which disagreinge from Gods woorde, doo confoul:de it with deuised reasons, and deriued from the craftie conceites of the minde, to the which, while they ouermuche beleue, when the light of the Truthe is gone, darkenesse dothe arise wherein they being wrapped, and blinded, & made maisters, and leaders of the blinde, doo with these false argumentes, and apparaunt reasons drawe many with them into the ditche, and alwaies swimminge in the deepe Sea of ignoraunce, and errours, slipperie like Serpentes, and craftely crepinge in with wily woordes of guile & deceite, doo misleade the ignoraunt sorte to beleue theire deuises: and extollinge them, doo presume to perswade that the Holy Scripture cannot strande without Logike, without brawlinge, without contention, without Sophismes. I 39 it doth profite Diuinitie, I see not, whose chiefest Logike doth consiste in quiet and plaine communication. For Christe hath not promised vs in vaine, sayinge, Aske, and ye shal receaue it. So then before the contentious schollers doo learne their Logike, let these faithfull Christians obtaine all necessarie Truthe of him that is maister of the Truthe. Moreouer Logike by reason of diuers clateringe toies cannot finally arise higher, then to Philosophie, but by the meanes of faithfull communication, men ascende the right & surest waie to the highest knowledge of diuine and humane matters. They are then deceaued who so euer saie that this Logike is the strongest engine of all to destroic Heretikes, whereas in deede shee is the fortresse of all Heretikes: in times paste the Heretikes Arrius, one affirmed diuerse substaunces in the Trinitee according to the degrees, and times, the other saide that the virgin Marie was not the mother of Christe: & this because they haue presumed to measure Gods woorkes with Logical Sophismes, obseruing more the subtil arguments of Aristotle, then cosidering the woordes of the Scripture of God. For all ye Doctrine of the Heretikes (as Hierome saithe) hath founde a place, & reste emonge the thornie brakes of Aristotle and Chrisippus. Hereupon speaketh Eunomius, & saithe, that whiche is borne, was not before it was borne. Hereupon saithe Maniceus, that he might exempte God from the state of the wicked, maketh him authour of wickednesse: for that cause Nouatus taketh awaie forgeuenes, that he maie take awaie repentaunce. Of these welspringes all the Doctrine of the Heretikes deriue the Riuers of their disputations: For sith that there is no communication, but maie be spoken againste, and no argumente, that maie not be disproued by an other, hereof it commeth to passe, that men cannot come to any ende of learninge, nor to any knowledge of the Truthe, by the meanes of Logical Disputations: but also it chaunceth, that many decline from the Truth, to Heresies, while they suppose to haue founde out a shewe of the strongest truthe with Logical Argumentes, or in sutche sorte reproue Heretikes, that they for al that, speake not sounder matters. Wherfore Plato willed, that Logike should be very slowly touched of wardeins, because shee disputeth on bothe partes, & rendreth weake reasons of honestie, and dishonestie. And thus we haue sufficiently spoken of Logike. Raimundus Lullius founde out in these latter times a monstrous Arte, little differinge from Logicke, by the whiche as in times paste Gorgias Leontinus did auaunte (who firste in a greate assemblie of learned men, presumed to reason of euery thinge) euery man mighte plentifully dispute of what matter he listed, and with a certaine artificial and huge heape of Nownes, and Uerbes, to inuente, and to dispute with ostentation ful of triflinge deceites on bothe sides, of euery curious communication, with this too trimme a skill, and to leaue no place for others to ouercome, and to dilate at large al smal and slender thinges. But it is not needeful to reason muche of these maters, for I haue els where made sufficiente large Commentaries vppon this Arte: but I wil not, that they shoulde deceiue any in so lighte an Arte: and albeit, I seemed to praise it exceadingelye, yet the thinge it selfe maketh it cleare, that we neede not greately to dispute about it: but herein I wil admonishe you, that this Arte auaileth more to the outwarde shewe of the witte, and to the ostentation of Learninge, then to gette knowledge, and hathe mutche more presumptuousnesse, then efficacie. Furthermore it is al togeather rude and barbarouse, excepte it be sette out with a certaine more singulare eloquence. Emonge these Artes, the Arte of Memorie is also accoumpted, whiche (as Cicero saithe) is nothinge els, but a certaine induction, and order of teachinge, consistinge of places, and Images, as it wer in a paper, deuised, first in Caracters by Simonides Melito, afterwarde broughte to perfection by Metrodorus Sceptius. Notwithstandinge what so euer it be, it canot stande without natural Memorie, whiche oftentimes is dulled with monstrounse Images, that oftentimes it causeth madnesse, and frensie in steede of profounde and sure Memorie, to wite, whilest that it burdeninge the natural Memorie with the Images of infinite thinges, and woordes, causeth them to become madde with Arte, that abide not contente with the limittes of nature. This is that Arte, whiche in times paste beinge offered to Themistocles by Siminodes, or by some other, he saide: I had leiser forget, because I remember many thinges, that I would not, and cannot forgette that I woulde. And Quintilian speakinge of Metrodorus, saithe: Doubtelesse his vanitie & boastinge ws to auaunte of his Memorie rather gotten by Arte, then geuen by nature. Cicero hathe written thereof in his newe Rhetorike, Quintilian in his Institutions, Seneca, and of the fresher sorte, Franciscus Petrarcha, Mareolus of Verona, Petrus of Rauenna, and Hermannus Buschius, and others, but vnworthie of rehersal, men little knowen, and many daiely professe this, but there is none founde, that hath muche profited in it, and the teachers thereof doo oftentimes in steede of gaine receiue reproche. For some knaues are woonte oftentimes in the Scholes with the profession of this Arte to begile scollers with the strangenesse of the thing craftily to despoile the vnaduised of theire monie. Finally it is a childishe bragge to boaste of Memorie: it is a shameful thinge, and a shamelesse mannes propertie to set out in al mens sighte, the readinge of many thinges, like as Marchantes doo theire wares: whereas in the meane while the howse is emptie. But nowe it is time to speake of the Mathematical sciences, whiche are thought of al others the moste certaine, and notwithstandinge they al consiste in nothinge els, but in the opinions of theire teachers, to whom greate credite is geuen: whiche haue also not a litle erred in them, whereof Albubatar one of them doothe witnesse vnto vs, saieing: that the auncientes euen after Aristotles time did not know the Mathematicalles. And for so muche as all these Artes for the most parte, haue to doo about spherical or rounde things, about figure, number, or mouinge, they are finally enforced to confesse, that there is no where perfectly founde any spherical or rounde forme, neither accordinge to Arte, nor Nature. And although these doctrines haue broughte fewe Heresies or none into the Churche, notwithstandinge as Augustine saithe, they appertaine nothinge to Saluation, but rather bringe menne into erroure, and withdrawe them from God, & (as Hierome saithe) they be not the sciences of Godlinesse. Numbringe, whiche is, as it were a mother to the residewe no lesse superstitious, and vaine, and for the vile practise of Numbringe is had in price of none, but Marchauntes for couetuousnesse sake: for it treateth of Numbers, & their diuisions, whiche is equal, whiche is vnequal, which is equally equal, whiche is vnequally vnequal, which is superfluous, which is lacking, whiche is perfecte, whiche is compunde, whiche is vncompounde, whiche is by him selfe, whiche is to an other. In like manner of proportion, and proportionallities, and of their speices. Of Harmonical Numbers, and Geometrical, of the diuers passions of Numbers and Minutes, and of the manner of accoumptinge. Cardes, Tables, and Dice, and all suche hazardinge Numbers. Albeit, al for manner of iudgemente, and also because they gette the vertue thereof, not so muche our ot Numbers, as out of Mouinges, accordinge to that saieinge of Aristotle, in the firste Booke of the Meteores: The mouinge of the Heauen is euerlastinge, and is the beginninge, and cause of al inferiour Mouinges. Emonge the auncientes Haly hathe written hereof: of them of latter yeeres, Gerardus of Cremona, Bartholomeus of Parmia, and a certaine man called Tundinus. I haue written also a certaine Booke of Geomancie, farre differinge from the other, but no lesse superstious, false, or if you liste, I will saie lieinge. In like manner the Arte of Disinge is altogeather hazardinge, the more studious that a man shalbe thereof, the wickeder, and vnhappier he shalbe, whileste that in desiringe other mennes goodes, he consumeth his owne, and hathe no respecte of his Patrimonie. This Arte is the mother of Lies, of Periuries, of Theste, of 40 Debate, of Iniuries, of Manslaughter, the very inuetion of the Diuels of Hell, whiche when the Kingedome of Asia was destroied, emonge the spoiles of the ransacked Citie vnder a diuers manner passed to the Greekes. Hereof same these games, not in vse emonge vs, as 41 Chestes, Senio, Monarchus, Oribiculi, Thaliorchus, Vulpes: moreouer Octocedron, Duodecacedron, in the which there is thoughte to be some Diuination. There are whiche saie, that Attalus Asiaticusl founde out this Arte, and diuised it through the Arte of Numbringe: but it is lefte in writinge by the Romains, that Claudius the Emperoure made a Booke of that Arte, whereof he, and before him, Auguistus C aesar were moste desirous, and studiouse. An Arte altogeather infamous, and forbidden Lacedimonian beinge sente Imbassadoure to the Corinthians to make League, when he founde the Gouernours and Aldermenne of Corinth playinge at the Dice, he departed leauinge his businesse vndonne, saieinge: that he would not staine the glorie of the Spartans with this infamie, that they should be saide to haue made League with Dicers. And it was accoumpted so greate a reproche emonge the noblest men, that the kinge of the Parthians And notwithstandinge at this daie, this is the most acustomed Pastime, that kinges & noble menne vse. What doo I call it a Pastime? Nay rather theire wisedome whiche herein hathe benne damnablie instructed to deceiue. and as somme suppose, Aristotle him selfe also beleued, that the Caracters of the Letters had certaine proper Numbers, by the whiche they did deuine thorowe the proper names of menne, the Numbers of euery Letter beinge gathered in a somme: whiche beinge put togeather they gaue him victorie, whose somme had erceaded the other, whether the question should be asked of Warre, of Debate, of Matrimonie, of Life, or any other like thinge. And in this manner they saie, that Patroclus was vanquished by Hector, and he by Achilles, the which thinge Terence hath written in these Uerses. The names in Letters were thus made, they write, That these in greater Numbers be, and cite The others in a lesser somme, and when A doubteful fight is to be made by men, The greater Number shewes who conquere shall, The lesser somme denotes the fatall fall. So was by Hectors hande Patroclus slaine, Achilles eke, laide him in Bluddy Baine. There are also whiche with the like computation promise, that thei wil finde out the Horoscope, as a certaine man called Alchandrius, a Philosopher of small fame, hathe written of these: who is reported to haue ben Aristotles Scoller. And Plinie writeth, that this was inuented by Pythagoras, the vnequal Number of Uowels, in proper names signifieth lacke of sighte, haltinge, and other suche like chaunces. shewed by a wicked spirite togeather with diceplaie. And Licurgus that great lawe maker of the Lacedemonians thougth good to bannishe it out of his common wealthe as a troublous thinge. For it dothe require a vaine and idle laboure, and withdraweth men from profitable and honeste affaires, and oftentimes doo vnmeasurablely sweare and stare for thinges of no valewe. Hereof cometh that frowarde contention 42 preferred: whiche number is perfecter three, sire, or tenne. In like manner whiche number is termed equally euen: aboute whose definition they saie that Euclides the very Prince of Geometrie was greately deceaued. Furthermore I shall hardly saie, what Pythagorean misteries, and what Magicall force they dreame to be in numbers, yea being bare of the thinges them selues: and presume to saie, that God coulde not haue Created the worlde without these instrumentes, and paternes: and that the knowledge of all deuine thinges is contaiend in 43 numbers, as in a rule much more certaine then al others. Hereof haue spronge the Heresies of Marcus Magus, and Valentinus, grounded vpon numbers, and deriued from numbers, which by meanes of very sainte numbers haue presumed to saie, that they are able to finde out, and declare Goddess Religion, and innumerable secretes of the heauenly Ueritie. Neare to these are the Pythagorean tetractes reckened emongst the Sacramentes, and many other thinges like vnto these, al whiche are vaine, false, and fained: neither doth there remaine any truth emong these Arithmeticians, but an vnsensible & liuelesse number: and yet they beleue that they be placed emonge Diuine men, because they be skilled in numbringe, but the Musitians doo hardly graunt them this prerogatiue, more willingly geuinge this honour to their Harmonie. Aristoxenus hath plentifully written, whiche saide that the soule is Musicke. Whose instructions Boetius did afterwarde write in Latine, I meane that, whiche consisteth in the Harmonie of voices, and soundes, not that whiche they terme the Musicke of Uerses, of Rithmes, & sayninge of Uerses, whiche is Poetrie, whiche as Alpharabius saithe, is not gotten somuche with speculation, and reason, as with the madnesse of furie, whereof we haue before spoken: but I speake of that whiche consisteth of pleasante tunes, the which is an agreement of the stringes, or voices, accordinge in their tune and measure, without offendinge of the eares: for shee treateth of soundes, of restes, of stoppes, of tunes, of chaunges of voices, and of measure. The Auncientes 44 firste vntouched, (that is Enharmonica) for the ouermuche hidden difficultie, seeminge to them impossible to finde out: the other they haue despised as dishonest and infamous, and haue onely aldwed the thirde kinde, (as perswaded that it was in facion like the framinge of the worlde). There are emonge the auncientes moreouer, which haue distinguised the measures of Musicke accordinge to the woordes of nations, as into the Phrigian, Lidian, Dorian, whche as Polimester and Saccada the Argine saie, were the auncientest, to the whiche Sappho Lesbia Mixilodium, the inuentoure whereof some thinke Tesander to be, some Pythoclides the Trumpetoure. Lisias saide that Lamprocles the Athenian was the Authour thereof: and thus the authoritie of the auncientes made these sower measures of Musicke: renowmed adn termed all these togeather. Enciclopedia, as it were the circle of Sciences, bicause Musicke dothe comprehende al disciplines, as Plato saithe in the firste booke of his Lawes, that Musicke cannot be entreated of without all disciplines. But of these sower measures they doo not alowe the Phrigian, it barbarous, because it is onely fitte to stirre by men to battaile, and furie. Some therefore call it Bacchical, as furious, violente, and troublous: with whose Harmonie, which they declare with the foote Anapestus, armes: Timotheus with the same incensed Kinge Alexander to warre: and a yonge man called Tauromitanus, according as Boetius saithe, beinge stirred vp with this Phrigian sounde, hastened to burne a house where there laie a strumpet hidden. Plato blameth moreouer the Lidian sounde, as Sharpe swaruinge from the modestie of the Dorian, fitte for lamentations: notwithstandinge (as it pleaseth some men) it si meete for such as are by nature merrie and pleasaunt. For this cause they saie that the Lidians a merie and very pleasaunt people, are delited with this Musicke. Which the Toscans moreouer the ofspring of the Lidians were wonte to vse in roundes. But the Dorian sounde as the grauest and honestest is in all measures modeste, conueniente to the grauest affections of the minde, and mouinges of the bodie, and profitable to liue well and vprightly they preferre before all the other: and therefore was had in greate reuerence of the 45 Cretensians, Lacedemonians, and Arcadians. Kinge Agamemmon, also goynge to the Troiane warre, lefte at home a Musitian that plaied the Dorian tune, who with the foote Spondeus preserued his wife Clitemnestra, in Chastitie and Honestie, wherefore shee coulde not be deflowred by Egisthus, before he had wickedly slaine the Musitian. things, and hath force to stirre vp, to drawe backe, and to put awaie sorrowe. There are some whiche haue founde besides these fower measures, others also, as them whiche they call Collaterall, that is, Hypodorius, Hypololydius, Planetes: to the whiche Ptolomeus yadded teh eighte, called Hipermixolidius, Apuleius in the firste Booke of his Florida doth write of fiue measures, the Eolian, the variynge Hiastian, the lamentable Lidian, the fierce Phrigian, and the religious Dorian. To these some doo adioigne the lustie and iocunde Ionick. Moreouer Martianus according to the tradition of Aristoxenus, doth number fiue principal measures, & ten Appendantes, sweetenesse, yet the comon opinion is, & also euery one maie see it by experience, that it is the exercise of base men, & of an vnprofitable & vntemperate wit, which haue no consideration of beginning nor endinge, as it is reade of Archabius the trumpetoure, to whom men were glad to geue more to make him cease, then to make him singe. Of whiche so vnreasonable Musitians Horace speaketh: It is a faulte, a common faulte that all our Minstrels vse, The more you seeme to craue a songe the more they will refuse. Request them not they neuer cease, &c. For this cause Musicke hath euer bene wandringe here & there for price and pence, and is the seruaunte of bawdrie whiche no graue, modeste, honeste, and valianunt man euer professed: and therefore the Greekes with a common woorde called them the Artificers of Father Bacchus, or els (as Aristotle saithe) Dionisiaci technit ae, that is the 46 vsed to haue lewde customes: leadinge for the moste parte, an vnchaste Life: partly also in Miserie, and Pouertie, the whiche bredeth and encreaseth Uices. The kinges of the Persians, and Medes reckened Musitians emonge Parasites, and Plaiers, as they whiche take pleasure of their owne dooinges, and make little accoumpte of the Maisters. And Antisthenes that wise man, when he hearde, that a certaine man, called Ismenias, was a very good Trumpetoure, he saide, he is a Rebaulde, for if he were an honest man, he woulde not be a Trumpetoure: for as it is saide, that is no sober, and honeste mannes Arte, but the practise of Plaiers and idle personnes. This did Scipio Emilianus, and Cato contemne, as farre of from the Custome of the Romaines. Augustus, and Nero were blamed, because they did ouer greedilye followe Musicke. But Augustus beinge reproued did refraine: Nero couetinge it more and more, was for this cause had in contempte, and little estimation. Kinge Philippe vnderstandiuge that his Sonne had sweetely songe in a certaine place, he reproued him, sayinge, arte thou not ashamed, that thou knowest to singe so well. It is enough, and soo much for a Prince, to haue leasure to heare, when other singe. Iupiter singeth not emong the Greeke Poetes, nor soundeth the Harpe. Learned Pallas dooth detest the Flute. In Homer a Harpar plaieth, and Alciones, and Ulisles and Dido doo harken. When on a time Alexander the greate did singe, Antigonus his Maister rente his Harpe a sunder, and caste it awaie, saieinge: It is nowe meete for thy age to Rule, and not to Singe. And the Egyptians also, as Diodorus testifieth, did forbid theire younge menne to learne Musicke, as that whiche dothe effeminate the mindes of men. And Ephorus, (as Polibius witnesseth) saide, that it was inuented to no other ende, but to deceiue men. But in very deede what is more vnprofitable, more to be despised, and more to be eschewed, then these Pipers, Singers, and other sortes of Musitians? whiche with so many, and diuers voices of songes surpassinge the chripinge of all Birdes, with a certaine venemous sweetenesse, like to the Mermaides, with voices, gestures, and lasciuious soundes, doo destroic and corrupte mens mindes. For the which thing the women of the Ciconians did perfecute Orpheus vnto the Deathe, because with his Musicke he corrupted their menne. But if there be any truthe in Fables, a hundred eies had Argus in his heade, all which notwithstandinge were broughte a sleepe, and put out with the Harmonie of one Baggepipe. And yet for this, these Musitians doo much boaste, as though that they were more able to moue the affections, then Rhetoritians are: which be so muche mistcadde by their maddenesse, that they affirme moreouer the Heauens them selues to singe, yet with voices neuer hearde of any man, excepte perhappes they haue come to the knowledge of those Musitians by meanes of theire Euouae, or through Drunckenesse, or Dreaminge. And yet in the meane season, there hathe no Musitian descended from Heauen, that hath knowen al the concordaunces of voices, and that hath founde out all the measures of proportions. And for all that they say, that it is a very perfecte Arte, and which comprehendeth all Disciplines, and that it cannot be handled without the knowledge of all Learninges: attributinge to it besides the force of Diuination, whereby the plightes of the bodye, the passions of the minde, the manners of men maie thereby he iudged. They saie moreouer, that it is an endelesse Arte, and that it cannot be thorowely learned with any witte: but that daiely according to the capacitie of euery man, it geueth freshe melodie. And therefore Anaxilas saithe not amisse: By God saithe he, Musike is euen like Affricke, it yeerely bringeth foorthe somme straunge Beaste. Anathasius for the vanitie therof did forbidde it the Churches: but Ambrose more desirous of Ceremonie & Pompe, ordained in the Church 47 in doubte, saith in his Confessions, that hereof there grewe to him a harde doubte: but now a daies the vnleeful libertie of Musicke, is so muche vsed in Churches, that togeather with the Canon of the Masse, very filthie songes haue like tunes in the Organs, and the Diuine Seruice is songe by lasciuious Musitians hired for a greate stipende, not for the vnderstandinge of the hearers, but for the stirringe vp of the minde: But for dishoneste lasciuiousnesse, not with manly voices, but with beastely skeekinge, while the children braie the Discante, somme bellowe the Tenoure, somme barke the Conterpointe, some howle the Treble, some grunte the Base, and cause many soundes to be hearde, and no woordes and sentences to be vnderstoode, but in this sorte the authoritie of iudgement is taken both from the eares, and minde. Maidens,  & Louers whiche they learne with greate care, and without tediousness doo prolonge it vntil midnighte, and with great diligence doo deuise to daunce with framed gestures, and with measurable pases to ye sound of the Cynibal, Harpe, of Flute, and doo as they thinke very wisely, & subtilly, the fondest thing of al other, & little differing fro madnes, whiche excepte it were tempered with the sounde of instrumentes, & same, as it is saide if vanitee did not commende vanitee, there shoulde be no sighte more ridiculous, nor more out of order then daunsinge: this is a libertie to wantonnesse, a friende to wickednesse, a prouocation to fleashly luste, enemie to chastitie, and a pastime vnworthy of al honest persons. There oftentimes a matrone (as Petrarcha saithe) hath loste her longe preserued honour: oftentimes the vnhappie maiden hath there learned that, wherof thee had benne better to be ignorant: there the same & honestie of many women is loste. Infinite from thece haue returned home vnchaste, many with a doubtful minde, but none chaste in thought and deede. And we haue often seene that womanlike honestie in daunsinge hath benne throwen downe to the grounde, and alwaies vehemently prouoked & assaulted: yet some of the Greeke writers haue commended it, as they haue many filthie & wicked thinges: and haue saide that the beginninges of this Daunsinge came as it were by inspiration from the highe Heauens from the course of the Sterres, and Planetes, from their goinge and turninge, meeting, and orderyas it were from a certaine Harmoniall daunsinge of the heauenly Bodies, togeather with the generation of the worlde. Some saie it was the inuention of the Satires: and affirme also that Bacchus by the meanes of this Arte conquered the Toscans, the Indians, & the Lidians, a vere warrelike Nation. For this cause at length this Daunsinge was brought into Religion, and was commaunded to be vsed by the Coribantes daunsinge, and there were neuer any scastes and ceremonies in the morninge and eueninge turninge towardes the Sunne, did honoure it daunsinge. Emonge the Ehtiopians also, Egyptians, Thraciaus, and Scithians, daunsinge was reckened emonge the Ceremonies of their Sacrifices, bicause it was ordained by Orpheus, and Museus excellent daunsers. There were also emonge the Romans the Priestes called Salij, whiche daunsed in the honour of Mars. The Lacedemonians the woorthiest of all the Greekes, when they had learned to daunse of Castor and Polhix, they accustomed to doo all thinges with daunsinge. It was so muche esteemed in Thessalia, that the Presidentes, and Chieftans were honored with the name of daunsers. Yea Socrates who was 48 ludged by the Oracle the wisest of all men, beinge of good peeres, was not ashamed to learne it, but praised it exceedingly, and reckened it emonge the grauest learninges: & the thinge seemed grauer vnto him, then that he mighte well speake of it, whiche being altogeather diuine should take his beginninge with the worlde, and come to lighte with Loue the auncient God. But it is no maruaile that the Greekes doo in this sorte studie Philosophie, whiche haue made the Goddes authours of Adultrie, of Whoredome, of Murder, and finally of all wickednesse. They haue written many bookes of daunsinge, in which is contained all the kindes, qualities, and measures, and haue reckened vp the names of them, and of what sorte euery one of them should be, and who inuented it: wherefore I will speake no further of them. The auncient Romaines grate men by reason of their wisedome an authoritee did refuse all daunsinge, and no honeste Matronie was commended emonge them for daunsinge. For this cause Salust did caste Sempronia in the teeth, for that shee songe and daunsed more cunningly then beseemed an honest woman: and which is more, Skilfulnes in daunsinge was a reproche to Gabinius, whiche had benne consull, and to Marcus Celius also: and Marcus Cato layde to Lucius Murena his charge that the daunsed ill Asia, whom Cicero defendinge, durst not maintaine this as a thinge well donne, but stoutely denied, that he did it: sayinge, No sober man excepte perhappes he ware peeuishe, daunseth in solitarinesse, in a moderate and honest bankette: but daunsinge is the worste companion of disordinate bankettes, of vnmeasurable pastime, and of filthy pleasures. Therefore it must needes be, that dausing is the vilest vice of al: and truely it cannot easely be saide what mischiefes the sighte, and the hiringe doo receaue hereby, whiche afterwarde be the causes of communication, & embracinge. They daunce with disordinate gestures, and with monstruous thumpinge of the feete, to pleasaunt soundes, to wanton songes, to dishonest verses: Maidens and Matrons are groped and handled with vnchaste handes, & kissed, and dishonestly embraced: and the thinges whiche nature hath hidden, modestie couered, are then oftentimes by meanes of lasciuiousnes made naked, and ribauldrie vnder the colour of pastime is dissembled. An exercise doubtlesse not descended from Heauen, but by the Deuils of Hell deuised to the iniurie of the diuinitee, when the people of Israell erected a Calfe in the deserte, which after they had done Sacrifice, began to eate, and drinke, and after warde rose vp to sporte themselues, and singinge, daunsed in a rounde. And thus we haue sufficiently spoken of daunsinge. I Am not yet ignoraunt in this place that there are beside many other kindes of daunsinge commended by auncient writers: of whiche the greatest parte is not this daie in vse, parte is yet in vse, as the dauncinge in Armoure fitte for swoorde playing, fencinge, and warrefarre, a tragicall Arte doubtles: wherein the plaie is to kill a giltlesse man, and a great infamie somewhat lingeringly to receaue a deadly wounde. An Arte to be detested of al men, to the madnes wherof crueltie is ioigned: and suche other like kindes of daunsinge, as they are full of vanitee, and impudencie, they are not so muche to be despised as detested, because they teache nothinge els but marueilous customes how men should ware madde. Demonstration, expressinge the thinges conceaued in the minde with a seemely gesture: so plainely an liuely representinge mens manners and affections: that the very beholder plainely perceaueth him to be a stage player vp infinite gestures, and mouinges, although he saie nothinge. This Arte dothe so much excell, that there neede no interpretours, for it dothe so aptly represent with pleasaunt gesture an olde man, a boye, a woman, a seruaunt, a handmaide, a drunkarde, an angrie person, and the differences and passions of all persons, that also the beholder standinge aloofe of, not hearinge the Enterlude maie perceaue the argument thereof by the onely motions of the Plaier. For this cause wee reade that stage plaiers haue benne had in greate price, and it is certaine as Macrobius recompteth, that Cicero was accustomed to cotende with Roserus the stage plaier (whom also Silla the dictatour helde very deare) whether he with diuers gestures, did oftener represent one thing, or he thorow his abundance of Eloquence did pronounce it in diuers talke: the whiche thinge moued Roscius to write a Booke, wherein he compared Eloquence with the Stage plaiers Arte. But the Citie of Marsiles, as Valerius writeth, kepte so greate granitie, that it woulde receaue into it no stage players, because their argumentes for the moste parte contained the actes, and dooinges of Harlottes, to the ende that the custome of beholdinge suche thinges, mighte not also cause a licence of folowinge it. And therefore to exercise this Arte, is not onely a dishonest and wicked occupation, but also to behold it, and therein a delite is a shameful thinge, bicause that the delite of a wanton minde is an offence. And to conclude, there was in times paste no name more infamous then stage players, and moreouer, al they that had plaide an Enterlude in the Theater, were by the lawes depriued from all honour. stage players, but not so vehement, whiche Socrates, Plato, Cicero, Quintilian, and very many of the Stoickes thought very profitable, and necessary for an Oratour: so that it were done with a certaine apte gesture of the bodie, and with a setled framinge of the countenaunce, and bodie: and also with the stedfastnes of the eies, with the grauitee of the countenaunce, and with the sounde of the voice applied to euery worde and sentence, with an effectuall mouinge of the bodie to such things, as are expressed, but without great sturringe of the bodie. Yet this daunsinge or Histrionical Rhetorike in the ende beganne to be lefte of all Oratours: and Augustus admonished Tiberius that he should speake with the mouthe not with the fingers, and at this presente it is altogeather laide aside: onely it is yet obserued of some staged Freers (albeit in times paste stage players were bannished out of the Churche, and denied the Holy Sacrament of Communion) of whiche some we see at this day to crie out of the pulpite to the people with marueilous straininge of the voice, with a diuers facioned countenance, with a rillinge and wanton eie, with castinge abroade of the armes, with daunsing feete, with inflamed reines, and with diuers mouings, reuolutions, turninges aboute, vpwarde lookes, leapinges, gesturinge with all his bodie, as that which because of the vnconstancie of the minde is enforced to turne with it: mindefull perhaps of the sentence of Demosthenes, who (as it is in Valerius) beinge demaunded, what was most effectual in speaking, he answeared, Pronuntiatio: being asked the seconde and the thirde time, he made the same answeare: and that all most al the force of speaking consisted herein. But leste we goe to farre astraie from our enterprised matter, let vs now goe to Geometrie. Geometrie, which Philo the Iewe termeth the Princesse and mother of al learninges, hath this prayse before other Sciences: that whereas well neare emonge al seats of learninges there be many and innumerable contentions, all the Geometricians doo accorde togeather on euery side: and at no time there is any contention emonge them but of pointes, of lines, of the vtter shewe of thinges, whether they maye be deuided or not, but they differ not one fro an other, neither in learninge, nor in teachinge: but euery one doth endeuoure to surpasse the other with newe & more subtill inuentions, whiche neuer any hath deuised. Yet no Geometrician hath founde out the true Quadrature of the Circle, and hath geuen no equall line to the side: although Archimedes the Syracusan in times paste, thought that he had founde out these thinges, and many after him vntil these daies haue thougth the same, but in a manner they haue gonne aboute it in vaine, although they seeme to haue saide thinges like to the Truthe. Yet suche is their ambition, that they will neuer reste vpon the preceptes of theire prodecessours, but beleuinge in suche thinges to finde out some thinge more then their Masters, doo bring 49 them selues into so great madnes, that al the  Helleborus in the worlde sufficeth not to purge it. Yet on this Geometrie doth depende: besides this, that it doth searche out the draughtes of figures, the spaces, the greatnesse, the bodies, the measures, and weightes: all the cunninge workinge of tooles, and artificiall instrumentes, Magnaries, Machanopocetickes, Poliorcetickes, fitte aswell for the warres, as buildinges, & other vses, as ye engins called 50 ladders, tolleons, walking towres, Heliopolins, shippes, galleis, bridges, miles. In like manner charriotes with twoo, with three, and fower wheles, poleys, crans, wheeles, leauers, and other instrumentes, by whose meanes very greate burdens are with small mighte and force drawen and raised vp. Moreouer all thinges whiche are made either of weighte, or water, or aire, or sinewes, or cordes, as the clockes which goe with weight, & Organs whiche sounde with blastes of winde:  51 and moreouer all watrie and windie instrumentes, and  of these, suche as are made but for pleasure and admiration: as balls daunsinge by themselues: candels making theire owne weekers: and gourdes that breathe fire out of them: and that beaste, which Politian speaketh of, who whilest that he is cut on the table, drinketh: and representeth the motions and voices of a liuinge creature. Of such a like workeman shippe speaketh Mercurius, that the Egyptians made the images of theire Goddes, that they could speake distinctly, and goo also. Architas Tarentinus also did in suche forte make a dooue of timber with Geometricall proportions, that he rose vp on high and fleweo. And it is reade moreouer, that Archimedes first wrought an heauen of brasse with so great workemanshippe, that therein the motions of all the Planetes were moste manifestly perceaued: and the reuolutions of al the heauenly sphere, like to the whiche we haue seene none made in these latter daies. Fro this Arte also come diuers sortes of warrelike instrumentes, gunnes, and other engins that caste fire: of whiche lately I made a special booke vnder the title of Pirographia: whereof now at the laste I doo muche repente me: because he teacheth nothinge els, but a moste damnable skil to doo exceadinge greate mischiefes. In fine all the cunninge that is in paintinge, in the measuring of the worlde, in grounde tilthe and trimminge, in the Arte of warre, in soundinge of mettals, in the Arte of woorkinge Images in earthe, in Image makinge, in forginge, in buildinge, and in mettals, for the moste parte cometh of Geometrie. Perspectiue: afterwarde the measure of the worlde, and Architecture. seeinge, that is to saie, The Straighte, the Bowinge, and the Broken or Scotched. It teacheth what is lighte, Shadowe, and Spaces, and perceaueth the causes of visible thinges, whiche seeme false by the distaunces: it considereth the spreadinge of the Beames, by one or many euidente thinges, vpon diuerse Figures of the bodyes, also the Representations of the Lighte, and shadowes, and that whiche dothe chaunce to thinges, to the Sighte, and to the Middeste: and sheweth in what sorte the Thinge, and the Sighte are diuersely affected thorowe the diuersitie of the middest. But there are sundrie and diuers opinions of the manner of seeinge. For Plato supposeth the Sighte to be made accordinge to the clearenesse: to weete, that whiche commeth from the eies: the Lighterunninge to an outwarde ayre, that Light whiche is carried from the bodies beinge broughte againste it: but that whiche is aboute the middeste of the aire, doth cause that it spreadeth, and turneth backe to the vertue of the Sighte beinge spreadde abroade, end like vnto Fire. Galene and Plato are of one opinion: but Hipparchus saithe, that the becames spreadinge abroade from the eies vnto bodies, touchinge them as it were with a certaine feelinge, or gropinge, doo geue that whiche they receiue to the Sighte. And the Epicures affirme, that the similitudes of thinges whiche appeare, doo of them selues enter into the eies. Aristotle is of opinion, that the similitudes of thinges not Corporal, but according to the qualitie thorowe the alteration of the aire, whiche is in compasse, doth come from visible thinges vnto the sight. But Porphirius saithe, that neither the Beames, neither the similitudes, nor any other thinge is the cause of seeinge, but the Soule alone, that knoweth her selfe visible, and that is one of al thinges, which knoweth her selfe in all thinges that are. The Geometritians and Perspectiuians approching some what neare to Hipparchus, doo affirme, that there be certaine Figures made of the meetinge togeather of the Beames, whiche are sente out thorowe the eies, from whence the Sighte doth comprehende in one, many visible thinges, but they moste certaine of all, where so euer the Beames shall meete togeather. Certes Alchindus saithe otherwise of the Sightes: but it seemeth to Augustine, that the power of the Soule dothe bringe somewhat to effecte in the eies, the whiche is not yet perceaued of the Studentes of Wisedome. This Science then dothe very muche auaile to finde out the Uarietie of the Heauenly bodyes, the Distaunce of the Greatenesse, the Mouinge, the Reuolutions, & Compasses of them, and serueth for Architecture in measuringe houses. Nexte to this, it geueth a very great Ornamente to Painters crafte, and to forginge of Glasses. In suche manner, that these Artes, without this, cannot be broughte to perfection. For it sheweth by what meanes we shoulde not faction numberlesse, and deformed thinges in Images, the whiche he seene, by reason of the spaces, and highnesse. Wherefore Paintinge is a monstrous Arte, but very studious for the countersayting of natural thinges, whiche consisteth in the description of Lines, and in the due layinge of Colours. This in time paste, was had in so great price, that it helde the firste degree of the Liberall Artes. Yet it is no lesse Liberal, then Poetrie, as Horace very wel hath saide. The Painters, and the Poetes eke, Haue alwaies had an equal power, VVhat thinges they liste to painte, and speake. as Poetes doo faine sables, and Histories, so doo Painters too, and doo expresse the likenesse of al thinges, the Light, the Brightnesse, the Shadowes, the Highest and Lowest partes. Moreouer Paintinge hathe this of the Arte Perspectiue, that it deceiueth the sighte, and in an Image diuersely placed, doth caste many fourmes ouer the cies of the beholders: and it dothe attaine to that, whereunto the Arte of Grauinge is neuer able to come, it painteth the Fire, the Sonne beames, the Lighte, the Thunder, the Lighteninge, the Gleames of Lighteninge, the goinge downe of the Sonne, the Morning, the Euening, the Clowdes, mens Passions, and Thoughtes of the minde: and doth almoste expresse the very voice, and with counterfaited measures, maketh the thinges seene whiche are not, as those whiche are, and maketh the thinges that are not 52 so, to appeare in an other manner. Euen as the Histori, doo recoumpte of Zeuxis, and Parrhasius the Painters, whiche, when they came in contention, touchinge the excellencie of workemanshippe, and that the firste had shewed grapes so liuely painted, that Birdes fiewe to them: The other broughte a painted sheete, counter saitinge the truthe in suche forte: that he puffed vp with pride for the iudgemente that the Birdes had of his Picture, desired him to take awaie the sheete, and shewe him the Picture. At the laste acknowledginge his erroure, was constmined to geue him the pricke and price, for so muche as he had deceiued the virdes, and Parrhasius, the craftes man. And Plinie a marueilous Picture: that the Crowes deceiued with the Apparaunce, flewe to the likenesse of Tyles. And accordinge as the same Authour saithe, in a solemne election of the Triumuiri, it was seene for a proufe, that the Birdes ceased to singe, by reason of a painted Serpente. Furthermore Paintinge hath this, that in all her workes, there is more vnderstoode, and iudged, the seene: as Plutarche very diligently hath sought out these thinges in his Images: and albeit the eunninge be great, yet the witte doth surpasse the eunninge. Foundinge, of Iewel Cuttinge, the workes of a lighte and foolishe witte, whiche maie yet also be comprehended vnder Architecture, Grauing forgeth the Images of Thinges, of Stoane, of Timber, of Iuorie: and the like doth the Moulder make of Clayr. But the Arte of Founding doth represent the in Brasse, and other Metals. The Ieweller doth graue in Stoane, & Pearle. Of these Artes, emonge them of latter time, hath Pomponius Gauricus written. Yet I thinke that al these Artes togeather with Paintinge were sounde out by the Diuelles of Hell, for Pompe, for pleasure, and for superstition. The workers whereof were they, whiche the Uncorruptible God, into the likenesse of a Corruptible Image of a Man, of Birdes, of Beastes, of Serpentes, whiche dooinge againste Goddes Commaundemente, forbiddinge that no grauen Image, or Likenesse shoulde be made, as well of the thinges which are aboue in Heauen, as of them whiche are in the Earth beneathe, haue broughte in an Idolatrie very odiouse to God, whereof the Wise man speaketh: The very Idoll is accursed, and he that made it, and that whiche is made shal suffer tormentes. For the vanitie of meane, as the same saithe, hath sounde out these Artes, for the temptation of mennes Soules, and to beguile the ignorante: and the inuention of them, is the corruption of Life. Neuerthelesse we Christians, doo in such sorte dote more then any Nations, that we are not ashamed to keepe this corruption of Life & manners, in euery place, in Halles, in Houses, and in Chambers. To the ende, that our Wiues, and Daughters maie with lasciuious Images be allured to Luxuriousnesse. Yea and whiche is more, with very great reuerence we carry them into Churches, into Holy places, and place them vpon the Aultare of God, not without daunger of Idolatrie: but hereof we wil speake more at large in Religion. Notwithstandinge, I learned in time paste in Italie, that there was in Pictures and Images, an authoritie greately to be esteemed: for whereas, there was an obstinate strife betweene the Augustine Freeres: and the vulgare Chanons before the Pope, cocerning the habite, or apparrel of S. Augustine, that is to saie, whether he did weare a blacke weede vpon a white Coate, or a white weede vpon a blacke Coate. And findinge nothinge in the Scriptures, whiche made to the ending of this strife, the Romaine Iudges thought good, to preferre the whole matter to Painters, and Image Makers, and that whiche they coulde auouche out of Auncient Pictures and Images, should be holden for a Definitiue sentence. I beyng grounded vpon this example, when sometime with exceadinge great diligence I searched for the Driginall of the Freers coule, and could finde nothinge for that matter in the Scriptures, at length, I wente me to the Painters, and for this thinge I sought in the Cloisters, & in the Celles of the Freers, where for the moste parte the Histories of bothe Testamentes are painted: and when I coulde not finde in all the Olde Testamente, none of the Patriarkes, none of the Priestes, none of the Prophets, none of the Leuites, nor yet Helias him selfe, whom the Carmelitans woulde haue to be their Patrone, with a coule: taking the Newe Testament in hande, I founde their Zacharie, Symeon, Iohn Baptist, Ioseph, Christe, the Apostles, the Disciples, the Scribes, the Phariseis, the high Prieste, Annas, Caiphas, Herode, Pilate, and many other, I sawe in no place a Freers coule: and againe diligently examininge euery thinge from the beginninge, immediatly in the foreparte of the Historie the Diuel was painted with a Cowle, to wite, he whiche wente to tempte Christe in the Deserte. 54 I reioiced exceadingly, that I had founde that in the pictures, whiche vntill that time I coulde not see in writing: that is to saie, that the Diuel was the first authour of the Cowle, of whom afterwarde, I suppose, that other Monkes, and Freers tooke vp the facion vnder diuers colours, or perhaps haue retained it, as a thinge lefte to them by inheritaunce. great healpe to them ye make Glasses, declaring al the affections, & deceites of such, whose experimentes be seene in diuers sortes of Glasses, Piraiuidal, the Turbinal, the bunched, the rounde, the cornered, the inuersed, the euersed, the regular, the vnregular, the massie, and the cleare. So we reade, as Celius recompteth in the auncient readinges, that in Augustus time a certaine man called Hostius, but without doubte the firste beginner of all dishonestie, made Glastes of such 55 sorte, whiche represented the Images of thinges farre greater then they were, that the finger did exceede in length, and greatnesse, the measure of the arme. There is made a Glasse also, wherein a man maie see the Image of an other, and not his owne. And an other, that beinge put in one place dothe expresse the Image of nothing: and remoued to an other place representeth likenesses. In like manner an other that causeth the Images of all thinges to appeare, and of one thinge to make many similitudes to be seene. And of an other sorte, that contrary to the manner of al other Glasses maketh the right side turne to the righte, and the lefte side to the lefte. And there are Glasses made, that burne before, and behinde, and an other, that dothe not represente the image receaued within him, but casteth it farre of in the ayre, and there dothe make it appeare like an ayrie image, and by the collection of the Sunne beames, with great force setteth fire very farre of in euery thinge that maie be burned, and many other like thinges, as I haue sometime seene, and knowen to make. Cleare Glasses haue also theire deceites, that is to saie, that they make a greate thinge seeme little, and contrarywise, the leaste thinges to appeare greate, and the thinges that are farre of, at hande,  & them that be neare to vs, to seeme farre hence, them that be vnder vs, ouer vs: and them that are aboue vs, to appeare beneath, or shewe them selues to our sight in an other manner. There be Glasses also, that make one thinge to appeare many, and other, that represente thinges in diuers colours, as are in the rainebowe, or vnder diuers and vnlike formes, the sighte beinge deceaued, & suche like. And I know how to make Glasses, in whiche, when the Sunne shineth, all thinges that are lightened with his beames, may very plainely be seene a great space of, as three or foure miles. And this is woorthy of admiration in the plaine Glasses, that the lesser they be accordinge to theire sise, doo represente the thinge lesser then it is, and howe greate soeuer they be, yet they neuer shewe the thinge greater then it is: the which Augustine consideringe writinge to Nebridius, is of opinion that there is within them some hidden thing: and to conclude all these thinges are vaine and superfluous, and inuented to no other ende, but for pompe and idle pleasure. Of Glasses many haue writen aswell Greekes, as Latines: but the beste of all is one Vitellius. Let vs nowe briefely discourse of the measure of the worlde, and this is deuided into Cosmographie, and Geographie, the one and the other dothe measure and deuide the worlde, but the firste accordyng to the order of the Heauenly bodies, and their diuision, sheweth the situation of countries, and places subiscte to them, by the measures of degrees, and minutes, and with Mathematicall rules teacheth the order of the climates, the difference of the daye and night, the quarters from whence the windes doo blowe, the diuers risinges of the Starres the Gleuations of the poles, the parallels, & noone tides, the shadowes of the Gnomons, and other thinges, which yet remaine to all places. But the other hauinge no consideration of the celestiall bodies, measureth the worlde by furionges & miles, and doth deuide it by Mountaines, Woodes, Lakes, Riuers, Seas, and Sea coastes, and sheweth the Nations, the People, the Kingdomes, the Prouinces, the Citties, the Heauens, and other thinges woorthy of memorie. And doth declare the Countries guise and setlinge of the soile, And what each Countrie bringeth foorth, and eke denies, with toile. And as it were with a certaine imitation of paintinge, dothe accordinge to the rules of Geometrie, and the Arte Perspectiue, expresse the whole worlde in a Globe, or plaine Table. Depaintinge all the worlde in little roume. searchinge out certaine particular places doth depainte them with a more perfecte, and as it were a full finished similitude: VVith sundrie kindes of pleasaunte sightes, be sette on euery side VVith vines, woodes, fieldes, and fountaines fresh, with medowes greene and wide, And fletinge streames of Riuers, whiche into the Sea doo slide. And where the Earth is pressed downe and riseth vp on hie, Vprearinge Hilles with loftie toppes vnto the Starrie skie. The measure of the worlde dothe promisse vs all these thinges, and them whiche we haue spoken of before. But the Authours, that will teache it vs, are with many discordes at contention emonge themselues of the Limites, Longitudes, Latitudes, Magnitudes, measures, distaunces, climates: muche disagreinge one from an other in that habitude or state wherein they be. The whiche Eratosthenes, Strabo, Marinus, Ptolomeus, Dionysius, and the fresher writers haue diuers waies deuided. They haue also diuers opinions touchinge the middest of the earthe, whiche Ptolomeus placeth vnder the Equinoctiall line, Strabo beleued, that Parnassus a moutaine in Greece was the middest of the Earth, to whome Plutarche, and Lactantius the Grammarian doo agree, supposinge that Mountaine to haue benne, in the time of the vniuersall This mountaines toppe appearde alone when stouddes did fill the lande, And twixte the Seas, and gleaminge starres did for a diffrence stande. But if this proufe be sufficient to ouercome, the middest of the Earthe shall not be in Parnassus the Mountaine of Greece, but in Gordicum a mountaine of Armenia, whiche as Berosus testifieth appeared, firste after the deluge, and vpon him the Arke of Noe lighted. Others are of an other opinion, and saie that the middest of the earthe was founde by the flight of Egles. There be Diuines also, whiche puttinge their hookes emonge this corne, will haue Ierusalem to be the middest of the earth, because it is writen by the Prophete: God hath wrought saluation in the middest of the Earthe. Lucretius, Lactantius.  & Augustine, doo assent to this opinion, which so obstinately denied that there were no Antipodes, ye is to saie, men, whosefeete are againste ours. And they moreouer, which saie, that beyode Europa, Asia, & Africa, is no other habitable world, ye which thinges yet are otherwise knowen of vs, whiche come after them, by the nauigations of the Spaniardes, and Portingales, whiche haue shewed also contrary to the trifles of the Poetes, and the false opinion of Aristotle, these recited before emonge the Historiographers many other errours of the Geographers. But this Arte, whilest it endeuoureth to teache vs the greatnesse of the Earthe, the deepenesse of the Sea, the situation of the Ilandes, and all countries, the limites, and notable markes, and also the vnknowen beginning of innumerable nations, the rites, customes, & differences, wee gette no other fruite thereof, but that whilest wee ouer greedely searche out other mens matters, doo learne not to knowe our selues. And as Augustine saithe in his confessions: Men goe to wonder at the highnesse of the Mountaines, the great surges of the Sea, and the broade runninge of the Riuers, the circuite of the Ocean sea, and the compasses of the Starres, & doo forsake them selues. Plinie also saithe, that it is a madnesse to measure the earthe, whiche while we measure, wee very often goo out of measure. profite, and ornamente, bothe in publicke and priuate buildinges: this geeueth vs Walls, Roofes, Milles, Charriotes, Bridges. Shippes, Churches, Teples, Oratories, Towne walls, Towers, and engines of all sortes, wherewith aswell the publicke as the priuate wealth of men is defended, and adourned, a discipline moreouer very necessarie, and honest, if it did not so muche bewitche the mindes of men: in suche wise, that there is founde almoste none (so that abilitie faile him not) whiche dothe not desire to enlarge the rome of his houses with some newe thinge, beinge alreadie well builte. Thorowe whiche insatiable desire and studie of building, it is come to passe, that there is no measure nor ende appointed herein: for this cause are hilles cut away, Ualleys filled vp, Mountaines made plaine, stoanes perced thorowe, and the rockes of the sea discouered, the entratles of the earthe digged, the riuers turned from their course, seas toyned to seas, lakes consumed, marishes dried vp, armes of the sea barred out, the bottomes of the sea searched out, new Ilandes made, and againe other resloared to the maine lande. All whiche thinges, and more then these, albeit thei repugne against nature, yet oftentimes haue broughte verie greate commoditie to all the worlde. But let vs compare suche thinges with these, whiche are nothinge auailable vnto men, but to beholde, expenses for an idle & foolish ostentatio of monie, as are the superstitious miracles of the woorkes of the Egyptians, of the Greekes, of the Toscans, of the Babylonians, and of some other nations, the Laberinthes, the Piramides, the Obeliskes, the Colosses, the exceeding sumptuouse sepulcres, the monstrous images of Rapsinates, of Sesostres, and of Amasis, the marueilous Sphinx, wherin men beieeued that kinge Amasis was buried. For it was wroughte (as Plinie saithe, in naturall and reade stoane: the compasse of the monsters heade aboute the foreheade 56 was a hundreth and two feete, and the lenght a hundreth fourtie three feete. But there are greater thinges then these, the worke af Memnon, and Semiramis, in Bagasianus, a mountaine of Media, the image was huge & greate beinge two miles and halfe a quarter in lengthe. Whiche thinges not withstandinge that cunninge builder, farre surpassed, what so euer he were, either Stesicrates: as Plutarch telleth, or Dinocrates, as Vitruuius recompteth, who promised that he woulde make the image of Alexander out of the mountaine Athos, whiche shoulde haue in his hande a citie sufficient to receiue ten thousande men. Let vs number with these the high Tower of Babylon, whose foundation (as Herodotus testifieth) was on euerye side the eight parte of a mile, and that Tower whiche is reported to haue bene builte in the bottome of the sea vpon lattises of glasse. Like to these were also the houses of Gordian, the arches of triumphe, and the temples of the Goddes, and especiallie that of Diana at Ephesus whiche was in buildinge by all Asia, the space of twoo hundreth yeares, and the temple of Latona in Egypte made with one stoane, beinge fourtie cubites of lenghte in the fore front, and the same couered with one stoane: and the golden image of Nabuchodonasar kinge of the Assyrians, beinge in greatenesse three scoure cubites, the whiche, he that did not honour was put to death: and an other foure manner be the Churches builded to our sainctes with exceedinge high roofes and steples set vp marueilous highe, with a great number of stoanes heaped togeather, whilest muche godly monie and almesse is consumed and caste awaie, whereby many poore Christians the true temples, and images of God, whiche are like to die for hunger, thirste, colde, sicknesse, and penurie, mighte, and ought of very good righte be builded and sustained. On the other side, what great destruction doth this arte very oftentimes bringe vnto men, castles, engines of warre, gonnes, artilerie, brakes, and other instrumentes spoilinge men of theire liuesa, no the people subdued by the sleight of them, are witnesses. Neither this is onely seene on the lande, for so muche as it hathe also taught to builde shippes, like castles, and fortresses: with whiche we do not so muche saile on, as inhabite the daungerous seas: and although by theire nature, they do anoye vs with a thousaunde daungers, yet with these shippes we make them muche more daungerous, robbing and warrefairinge in them, no otherwise then we do in the maine lande. The firste that wrote of Architecture, was Agatarchus the Atheniane, afterwarde Democritus Cato, Varro, Plinie, at the laste Vitruuins, Nigrigentus: of the fresher sort Leo Baptista, Freer Lucas, and Albertus Durerus. doubtelesse of gceate witte. For firste it tenchethe to know by the superficial or vppermost parte of the ground, & mountaines the veins, whiche are within the earthe, to what place they runne, the [illeg.] riches, and when the entrailes of the earth are [illeg.] the hugenesse of the hils should be propped, and helde vp: of which thinges emong the auncientes Strato Lampsacenus hathe writen a booke, whiche he intituled of Mettal instrumentes. Not withstandinge either none, or very fewe hither vnto haue perfectely taught the manner to melte pure Mettalles with the cleare flames of the fiere from stoanes digged out of mineries, and when they be mixed togeather, to knowe howe to parte them: peraduenture bicause this Arte, as an handie crafte, and seruil occupation, is little esteemed of learned men, and noble wittes. Neuerthelesse when I a fewe yeares paste had charge ouer certaine of the Emperours maiesties minerals, hauinge searched out all thinges asmuche as was possible for me, I began to write a speciall booke of them, which yet I haue in my handes cotinually augmenting, and correctinge it for the greater knowledge of thinges: hopinge that I wil not omitte any thinge, that appertaineth to the findinge of Mettalles, to the knowledge of them, to the trying and vndoing of the veins, to the propping of mountaines, to instrumentes to digge, and other skilles not knowen, vnto this daie. By this Arte, all worldly wealth is maintained, for the greedinesse whereof suche a fantasie came in mennes braines, that they go euen vnto hel alive, and with the greate decaie of nature do search riches where damned soules do dwel: as Ouide faithe: Men deape descende into the earthe with mattocke, Shoule and Spade: And wicked wealth is digged vp which mischiefes al hath made. Dame nature did it hide and put where greeslie ghoostes do dwell: And nowe the hurtfull yron, and the glitteringe golde from hell Proceeded is, more noisome then th'other Mettal vile: Through foule desire whereof for aie is vertue in exile. Shame, Truthe, and Eaithe are put to flight, theire place do these vpholde: Bothe fraude, deceite, fell force, and wiles and wicked loue of Golde. For Golde is faithe enforc'd to flee The Lawes are solde for Golden fee. Wherefore he that firste founde out golde mines, and others veins of Mettall, inuented a vengeable, mischeifous deede to our liue, and as Plinie saith, they haue made the earthe so muche more hurtefull, that they be no lesse vnaduised then they whiche go to searche pearles in the bottome of the sea. The inuention hereof is attributed to many, but the Historiographers differ one from an other. But yet the chiefeste write, that leade was firste founde in the Ilandes lyinge ouer againste Spaine, called 57 Cassiterides: Brasse in Cyprus, Yron in Candie, but Golde and Siluer neare to Pangeus a mountaine of Thrace, finally they infected and corrupted all the worlde. The Scithians alone, as Solinus recompteth, did condemne for euer the vse of Golde and Siluer, thereby withdrawing themselues from common couetousnes. As touchinge the superfluitee of Golde, it was in time paste prouided by an auncient Lawe emong the Romaines, and there was the censours lawe of Golde mines, by which (as Plinie saith) it was forbidden in the Territorie of Versilia, that the Farmars shoulde not haue aboue fiue men. And I would to God, that men woulde applie themselues to heauenlie thinges, as they do searche out the entrailes of the earth, allured by the onely veine of riches: whiche cannot make a man so happie and blessed, so that very many and that not seldome do greeuouslie repente them of theire bestowed laboure. altogeather false, and fuller of triflinge toyes then the fables of Poetes: The teachers whereof are doubtelesse presumptuouse, and authours of mosters, & with wicked curiositie according to their pleasure do draw out vpon mans destinie (like the Heretikes Basilides) the Spheres of the Heauens, the measure of the Starres, the Mouinges, the Figures, the Images, the measures, and the agreementes, as men that haue lately descended from heauen, and haue bene conuer sante for a space emonge them, by the whiche they beleue, that all things maie stande, be done, and knowen: yet cocerning the same thinges there be emong them many disagreing, contrarye, and hitherto at variaurce: so that I dare saye with Plinie, that the inconstauncie of this Arte bothe openly declarc, that it is no Arte, for so muthe as touching the principles thereof the Indians haue one opinion, the Chaldeans an other, the Egyptians an other, & the latter Writers an other. For Plato, Proclus, Aristotle, Auerrois, and well neare all the Astrologers before Alphonsus excepting a fewe entreating of the number of Spheres, haue numbred but eighte. Notwithstandinge Auerrois, and Rabbi Isaac saie, that Hermes opinion Azaicheles Maurus, Tebith, and the same learned man Rabbi Isaac, agree, surnamed in his time, I knowe not for what notable Arte, ye great, and al them that haue preued the mouinge of approching and departinge. The Astrologers in these dayes do accompte tene Spheres, which Alberte he eight. But Alphonsus sometime folowinge the iudgemente of Rabbi Isaac, yeares after the edition of his tables, he cleaued to the opinions of Albuhassem, of Azarcheles Maurus, and Albategnus, & chaunged his opinion approuing eight Spheres. These Masters also, Rabbi Abraam Auenazra, and Rabbi Leui, and Rabbi Abraam Zacutus do coniecture, that there is no moueable Sphere aboue the eighte. But the Astrologers also do varie muche emonge themselues touchinge the mouing of the eight Spheare, & fixed Starres. For the Caldees and Egyptians do affirme, that it is moued onely after one manner, to whome doth Alpetragus accorde, and of the latter writers, Alexander Aquilinus: but the other Astrologers from Hypparchus vnto oure time say, ye it is carried about with many mouings. The Iewes Thalmudistes do appoint a double mouinge: Azarcheles, Thebith, and Iohn of Monteregio, haue added to it the mouinge of the trepidation, whiche they cal of approching and departing vpon little circles, about the heades of Aries and Libra: but herein disagreeinge one from an other in that Azarcheles saithe, that the moueable heade cannot be distante from the fixed more then ten partes: & for this cause he holdeth opinion that the fixed Starres do lie towardes one certaine place of the worlde. But Tebith Regiomonte thinketh not aboue viii. partes, and therfore the fixed Starres do not lie alwaies towardes one certaine parte of the world: but do suppose that somtime retourne thither, from whence they began theire course. But Ptolomee. Albategnus, Rabbi Leui, Auenazra, Zacutus, and emonge the latter sorte Paule the Florentine, and Augustine Ritius my very friende in Italie, affirme that the Starres do alwaies and continually moue accordinge to the succession of the Signes. But the Astrologers of the latter time do attribute a triple mouing to the eight Sphere, one proper, which we haue called the mouinge of trepidation, which is once finished in seuen thousande yeares, the other, which they cal the mouinge of compasse from the ninethe Spheare, whose reuolution is not ended in lesse then fourtie nine yeares: the thirde from the tenth Spheare, which they terme the mouinge of the firste moueable, or the violent mouinge, or the diurnal mouing, which in the space of one natural day, doth eftsoones return to his begining. Furthermore they which haue assigned a double mouinge to the eights Spheare, do not al agree togeather. For wel neare al the writers in these daies, and they that allows the mouing of the trepidatio, do argue that it is forciblely drawen fro ye higher Spheare: but Albategnus, Albuhassen, Altraganus, Auerrois, Rabbi Leui, Abraam, Lacutus, and Augustine Ritius be of opinion that the diurnal mouing which some woulde haue to be the violent mouing doth not belonge to any Sphere, but is caused by the whole heauen. Auerrois also saith, that Ptolome in a certaine booke of his (whiche he entituled of Narrations) denied the mouinge of compasse, and Rabbi Leui saithe, that he and Auerrois of one opinion in that they vphelde the diurnal mouinge to be caused of the whole heauen. They agree no better togeather about the measure of the mouing of the eight Sphere & of the fixed Starres. For Ptolomee supposeth that the fixed Starres doe moue a degree in a hundreth yeares. Albategnus dothe maintaine that this is done in three scoare and sixe Egyptian yeares, to whome Rabbi Leui , Rabbi Zacutus, and Alphonsus in the correction of his tables do agree: Azarcheles Maurus saithe, that they moue a degree in lxxvii. yeres. Hipparch es in lxxviii. Many of the Hebrewes, as Rabbi Iosua, Rabbi Moses, Maymonus, Rabbi Auenazra, and after them Haly Benrodam, in lxx. yeares, Iohn of Monteregio in lxxx. Augustine Rithius keapeth a meane betweene the opinions of Albategnus,  & of the heaue sooner then in lxxi, yeres, nor latter the in lxx. but Rabbi Abraam, & Zacutus moreouer, as saithe Ritius, affirme accordinge to the doctrine of the Indians, that there be also two Starres in the heauen directly opposit the one against the other, which contrary to the order of yt signes do not end their course, but in Cxliiij. yeres, Alpetragus also iudgeth that therebe yet in ye heauens diuers mouinges to men vnknowne: which if it be true, there maie be emonge theim also starres and bodies, to whom these mouinges may accorde, the which men coulde not see either for the exceedinge highnesse, or vntill this daie they haue not perceaued it with any obseruation of Arte, whereunto also dothe Fauorinus the Philosopher in Gellie agree, in his Oration againste the casters of natiuities. It resteth then that there is no Astronomer come downe from Heauen that hath benne able to teache the true, and certaine mouinge of the thinges that are thought not to moue. Neither hathe the true mouinge of Mars bene knowen vntill this daie: whiche Iohn of Monteregio dothe lamente, in a certaine Epistle or Letter to Blanchinus: and there was one VVilliam of Sainct Clodoald, a famouse Astrologer two hundreth yeares paste and more, who lefte written the erroure of this mouinge in his obseruations, & yet none after him hath corrected his doinges. And which is more, it is impossible to finde out ye true entringe of the Sunne into the Equinoctial poinctes, the which Rabbi Leui proueth with many reasons. But what shall we speake of thinges founde afterward, how the Auncients haue ben deceaued aboute them. For many togeather with Tebith haue thought that the greate declination of the Sunne is continually chaunged, although not withstandinge it be caried with one measure. Otherwise yet Ptolomee hath thought thereof, otherwise it was founde by Albaten, Rabbi Leui, Auenazra, and Alphonsus. Semblablely also so touchinge the mouinge of the Sunne, and measure of the yeare, they haue otherwise thought, then Ptolomee, and Hipparchus haue taught. Likewise concerning the highest poincte of the Sunnes mouinge, Ptolomee hath otherwise supposed, otherwise also hath Albategnus  & others denied. Moreouer concerning ye Images of the heauens, & consideration of the fixed starres, the Indians haue taught one waie, the Egyptians an other, the Arabians an other, Timotheus an other, Arsatilis an other, Hipparchus an other, Ptolomee an other, and the latter writers an other. I lette here to speake how muche they dote touchinge the righte & leafte beginninge of the heauen: of which Thomas Aquinas, and Alberte the Dutcheman, superstitious Diuines, whilest they endeuoured to vtter some thinge orderly, coulde not finde any thinge to shewe, an none truely could euer finde it out. And more 58 the Milkie circle. I let passe also to prolong my talke of the Eccentrickes, Concentrickes, Epicicles, Retrogadations, Trepidations, approchinges, departinges of the violent courses, and other mouinges, and circles of mouinges, for so muche as all these thinges be not the woorkes of God nor Nature, but monsters of the Mathematiciens, and triflinge tromperies of sayning liers, deriued from corrupte Philosophie, and fabulous Poetes: to the whiche yet as to true thinges created by God, or stablished by nature, these Masters be not ashamed to geue so much credite, that what thinges soeuer be donne in these inferiour places, the same they attribute to these trifles as their causes, and saie that these inuented mouinges be the beginnes of all the inferioure mouinges. Anaximenes his woma seruat, did wittily reproue these Astronomers with a preatie sayinge, shee was wonte sometime to walke forthe with her Maister, who when on a night he wente out of his house to beholde ye starres, vnmindeful of the situation of the place, whilest that he beholdinge the Heauens, diligently searched out the starres, he fell into a diche that was before his feete, then saide the woman seruaunt vnto him: I meruaile Master by what meanes thou thinkest to know the thinges that are in Heauen, sithe thou caust not see them that are before thy feete. It is saide that Thales Milesius was with the like pleasaunt ieste reproued by Thressa his mayde. Tullie saith well neare the like of them: the Astrologers saith he, whilest they searche out the climates of the Heauen, none of them seeth, what is before their feete. I also being a boye learned this Arte of my Father, afterward I loste muche time and laboure therein: at length I learned that wholy and altogeather it was builte vpon no other foundation but vpon meere trifles, and fayninges of imaginations: and I am not onely sorie, but also doo repente me of my besrowed laboure, and I desired to rase out the remembraunce and vse thereof, and it is longe since that I did renounce it, and would neuer haue taken the same in hande againe, had not the importunate prayers of noble parsonages (whiche are wonte oftentimes to abuse passinge good wittes in doinge many vnwoorthie actes) oftentimes enforced me eftsoones to take it in had. And my peculiare profite perswaded me sometimes to auaile my selfe by their folie, and please them in their trifles, that so muche desired trifles, and I call them trifles, because that Astrologie hath nothinge els but meere trifles, poetes fables, & monstrous sayninges, with whiche they haue imagined that the Heauen is aboundantly replenished. And there is no sorte of men, that more agree togeather, then Astrologers and Poetes, sauinge that they disagree emonge them selues touching Lucifer, Starre, for so muche as the Poetes affirme that in what daie so euer Lucifer appeareth before the Sunne risinge, in the same daie he cometh neare the Sunne, when he goeth downe, and well neere all Astrologers doo denie they sooner appeare in the rising, and latter hide them selues in the goinge downe. But, if I had not now remembred me, I should haue passed ouer this discorde of the Astrologers concerning the situation of the Starres, or Planetes: for it dothe not so much appertaine to Astrologers, as to Philosophers. For Plato placeth the seconde sphere of the Sunne after the Moone, the same doo the Egyptians placinge the Sunne betweene the Moone and Mercurie. Alchimenides and the Caldees, doo place the Sunne the fourthe in order. Anaximander Metrodorus Chius, and Crates saie, that the Sunne is setled highest of al, nexte to him the Moone, beneath these other moueable and fixed Starres: Xenocrates supposeth that all the starres be moued in one selfe same vpper parte. They doo no lesse differ touchinge the greatnesse and distaunce of the Sunne, the Moone, & other Starres, neither is there emonge them any constancie of opinion, nor veritie of celestiall thinges: & that no marueile, fithe that the Heauen it selfe whiche they dsligently searche is moste vnconstant of all, and full stored with trifles and Fables: for the twelue Signes, and the other Northerly and Southerly figures, haue not ascended into Heauen but with Fables, and yet the Astrologers do liue, abuse men, and gaine by these fables, whilest the Poetes inuentours of them doo leade their life in greate necessitie. Diuinatorie, or Iuditiall, the which entreateth of the reuolutions of the yeares of the world, of natiuities, of questions, of elections, of intetes and thoughtes, it teacheth moreouer to fore tell, to call backe, to auoide or flee the endes of all thinges that maie happen, and the secrete disposition of Gods prouidence. Therfore the Astrologers do buye the effectes of the heauens and starres of yeares that be very longe to come, or before times whereof there is scarslie any memorie or before Prometheus times, of the great coniuctions (as they 59 saie) before the floudde: and doo affirme that the effectes, the forces, and the mouinges of all liuinge creatures, stoones, mettals, hearbes, and what thinges so euer be created in these inferiour places, doo proceede from the Heauens, and Starres, & doo depende altogeather vpon them, and maie by their means be founde out: Faithlesse men doubtlesse and no lesse wicked: not knowinge this one thinge, that God created hearbes, plantes, and trees, before he made the Heauens and the Starres. Moreouer all the grauest Philosophers, as Pythagoras, Democritus, Bion, Fauorinus, Panetius, Carneades, Possidonius, Timeus, Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Porphirius, Auicenna, Auerrois, Hippocrates, Galen, Alexander Aphrodiscus, & Cicero, Seneca, out of euery Arte  & Science, neuer did vs go to these causes of Astrologie: which although they were causes, notwithstandinge because they doo not plainely perceaue the courses of the starres, and their forces, (whiche thinge is very plaine to al wise men) they cannot geue a certaine iudgement of their effectes. And there wante not emonge them, as Eudoxus, Archelaus, Cassandrus, Hoychilax, Halicarnasseus very skilfull Mathematiciens, and many other latter writers, and moste graue Authours, whiche confesse that it is impossible to finde out any certaine thinge concerninge the knowledge of iudgementes, aswell for other innumerable causes, whiche worke togeather with the heauen, whiche we ought to consider, and so willeth Ptolomee: as also because very many occasions doo let the, as customes, vsages, education, honestie, rule, place, birthe, bloudde, meate, libertie of the minde, and learninge, for so muche as those influences doo not constraine (as they saie) but encline. Moreouer they that haue writen the rules of iudgementes, write so diuers and contrarie opinions vpon one thinge, that it is impossible for an Astrologian to pronounce any certaine thinge vpon so variable and disagreinge opinions, excepte there be in him some inwarde perceauinge of thinges to come and hidden, and inspiration of foreknowledge, or rather a secrete & priuie inspiration of the Diuell, whereby he may know how to geue iudgemet in these thinges, or by some other meanes is induced to cleaue nowe to this opinion, nowe to that: which instinction or inwarde motion who so wanteth, he in Astrologicall iudgementes (as Haly saithe) cannot tell the truthe: wherfore Astrologicall prophecie dothe not so muche consiste in Arte, as in a certaine diffuse chaunce of thinges: and as by chaunce, not by Arte, the Uerse dothe rise vp out of the Bookes of pastime, neuer tellinge the truthe, so also out of the Astrologers minde doo prophecies preceede not by Arte, but by chaunce, which Ptolomee doth also witnesse, saying: The knowledge of the starres dependeth of thee and them, meaninge that the foretellinge of thinges hidden and to come, dothe not so muche depende vpon the obseruation of the Starres, as the affections of the minde. Wherefore there is no certaintee in this Arte, but may be applied to al thinges accordinge to the opinio, which is gathered of coiectures, supposal, or of the vnperceaueable inspiration of Deuiles, or of superstitious chaunce. Wherefore this Arte is nothing els but a false coniecture of superstitious parsons, which thorow 60 long practise haue made a Science of things vncertaine, whereby they deceiue the simple sorte, to thende to spoile them of theire monie, and they themselues are deceaued also. But if these mens Arte be true, and vnderstoode by them, from whence cometh it, that so many errours be seene in their Pregnostications? if not, doo thei not vainly, foolishly & wickedly, professe a knowledge of thinges that are not, or be not vnderstoode? But the warest of them speake but darkely of things to come, and with Artificiall subteltie doo deuise doubtfull Pregnostications, whiche maie be applied to euery thinge, Time, Prince, and Nation. But after that any of these thinges hath happened, then they gather the causes thereof: & so when the thinge is come to passe, thei fortifie the olde Prognostications with newe reasons, that they maie seeme to haue foreseene, as the interpretours of dreames doo, which seinge the dreame, vnderstande no certaine thing, but when any thing hath after warde hapned vnto them, then they applie the dreame to that whiche is chaunced. Furthermore, seinge it is impossible in so greate a varietie of the Starres to finde out some placed in a good aspecte, some in an ill, they take occasion hereupon to speake what they liste, and to whom they please thei promisse life, saulftie, honours, wealth, power, victorie, health, children, friendes, mariages, benefices, offices, and suche like. But if to any they be not fauourable, to them they pronounce deathe, hanginge, dishonour, misery, exile, deathe of their parentes, sicknesse, and misfortune: not so muche of theire wicked Arte, as of theire naughty affections bringinge them to destruction that giue credite to this wicked curiositie, & oftentimes also moue the people and Princes to cruell warres and seditions. And if perchaunce fortune doo agree with theire Prognostications, that emonge so many doubtfull matters there shall some truthe or other fall out, it is a maruaile to see how they lifte vp their combes, & how proudly they auaunte thereof. And if they continually lyinge be once conuicted of a forgerie, then thei excuse it with blasphemie, or cloke one lie with an other: sayinge, that the wise man ruleth the Starres, whereas in deede, neither the starres ruleth the wise man, nor the wise man the starres, but God ruleth them bothe: or they saie, that the vnaptnesse of the receauer lefted the heauely influences. And they be displeased with them that seeke further credence: & neuerthelesse these floisteringe dissemblers finde out Princes, and Magistrates, which beleue all thinges that they speake, and entertaine them with common stipendes, 61 whereas in deede there is no kinde of men more pestilent to the publike wealth, then these: which by the starres, by lokinge in handes, by dreames, and such other skilles of diuination promisse thinges to come, & spreade abroade Prognostications, men moreouer alwaies hatefull to Christe & to all them that beleue in him: of whom Cornelius Tacitus complaineth: the Mathematiciens, for so they are commonly called (saith he) a kinde of men disloyall to Princes, deceiuinge them that beleue them, are alwaies forbidde our Citie, but neuer bannished. Varro also a substanciall Authour testifieth, that the vanities of all superstitions flowed out of the bosome of Astrologie. There was a tribute in Alexandria, whiche the Astrologers 62 liuinge by a wittie folie, and none but foolishe & brainelesse persons wente to them for counsaile: and if mans life and fortune depende of the starres, why are we feareful? why be we careful? why doo we not leaue these thinges to God, and the Heauens, whiche cannot erre, nor doo euill? & for so much as we are men, we must not seeke to know any thing aboue our reach: but earthly thinges alone: and whiche is more, seinge we be Christians and beleue in Christe, let vs leaue the howers & minutes to God the father, who hath put them in his owne power. But if our life and fortune depende not of the starres, doth not euery Astrologer seeke where nothinge is to be founde? But mankinde is so false harted & lighte of beleefe, that like children they feare more at the fables of Hobgoblin, and doo beleue more the thinges, that are not, then them whiche are, & the lesse impossible a thinge is, so much the more they stande in feare thereof: and the lesse vnlikely it is to be true, so much the more stedfastly they beleue it, and verely if suche were not, the Astrologers and Diuinours should die for hunger: and their foolishe lighte beleefe forgettinge thinges paste, neglectinge thinges present, very hastie to knowe thinges to come doth so fauoure these abusers, that whereas in other me for makinge onelie, the faithe of him that speaketh is so muche mistrusted, that all the residewe beinge true are not regarded: cotrarywise in these Masters of forgeries, one veritee spoken by happe, giueth credite to their common lies: whiche truely who so doo moste beleue, become of all menne the moste vnhappie, as these superstitious trifles are wonte to bringe destruction to the professours thereof: whiche antiquitie testifieth in Zoroastes Pharo, Nabuchodonosar, C aesar, Crassus, Pompei, Diothar, Nero, and Iulianus Apostata, whiche as they were very muche enclined to these trifles, so did they moste miserablie dye thorow trustinge in them: and to whome the Astrologers haue promised all ioyefull thinges, all haue chaunced sorrowful: as to Pompei, Crassus, excepte he were and olde man, excepte he were in his house, and except he were in honoure, but yet euery one of them died an euill death, and before the time. An obstinate doubtlesse and preposterous kinde of men, whiche bragge that they are able to prognosticate thinges to come, and knowe not them that be passed, and present: and whereas they professe themselues to tel al men al the most secrete thinges, very often they be ignoraunt what is done in their owne house, and in theire chamber: suche a kinde of Astrologer sir Thomas Moore reproued in this prety Epigramme, To thee thou airie Prophet all the Starres themselues do showe: And do declare what destinies, all men shall haue bylowe. But no Starres (though they all thinges see) admonish thee of this: That thy wife doth with erie man, behaue her selfe amisse. Saturnus standes, farre of men saie, that he longe since was blinde And scarcely coulde decerne a childe, and from a stoane him finde. Faire Luna goes with shamefaste eye, a Virgine naught wil see: But suche thinges as beseeme a maide, and lightnes al wil flee. Ioue to Europa gaue his harte, to Mars did Venus cleeue: And Mars againe did Venus serue, to Daphne, Sol did geeue His loue, and Mercurie did call to minde his Hirce deare: Hereof it comes to passe, o thou vnwise Astrologere. That when thy wife delited is, with lusty younkers loue: Thereof do nothinge notifie, to thee the starres aboue. Egyptians, Persians, Greekes, and Arabians, do disagree emonge themselues of the very same rules of iudgementes and in what maner Ptolomee Auenrodan, so he prouoketh Albumasar, and againste all these dothe Abraam Auenazre the Hebrewe raile: finally Dorotheus, Paulus Alexandrinus, Ephestion, Maternus, Aomar, Tebith, Alchindus, Zazel, Messahalla, and well neare all other hold diuers opinions, and when they cannot proue that true whiche they speake, they defende it with the onely reason of proufe: nor do all agree with one consente thereupon: and do no lesse differ touchinge the proprietie of the houses, out of which they get appointe after one sorte, Heliodorus after another, Paulus after an other, Manlius after an other, Maternus after an other, Porphyrie other sorte, the Arabians, the Greekes, and the Latines after an other, the aunciente, after an other, the latter writers after an other Bicause thei be not yet resolued emong themselues how they ought to erecte the beginninges and the endes of the houses, for so muche as the auncientes make them after one manner, Ptolomee after an other, Campanus after an other, Iohn of Monteregio after another. Wherof it commeth to passe, that they in theire owne obseruations do abate their credit, ascribinge diueis properties, beginnings and endes to the same places: a wicked generation of men, which attribute the thinges that belonge to God, vnto the Starres, and make vs when wee were childerne, seruauntes of the Starres, and whereas we knowe that God hath created al thinges, they teache that there be certaine malitious Starres, the causes of mischiefes, and naughty influences, ordaining not without exeedinge greate iniurie of God an the heauens, that in the heauenly places, in that diuine Senate, mischiefes, and ribaldries, are determined to be done, and what so euer willingly we commit what so euer thorow the corruption of matter dothe naturally befal, they attribute it wholy to the Starres. Moreouer they are not ashamed to teache Heresies & very damnable vntruthes, that is to saye, whilest they with a wicked rashenesse do confesse the gifte of prophecie, the force of religion, the secretes of coscience, the power ouer diuels, the vertue of miracles, the efficacie of praiers, and the state of the lyfe to come dothe onely depende vpon the Starres, is giuen by them, and knowne by them. For they saie, that when the figure of Gemini is ascendente, and that Saturne and Mercurie be ioyned in Aquarie, in the ninthe house of the Heauens, that there is a Prophete borne, and therefore had Christe our Lorde so many vertues, bicause he had in that place Saturne in Gemini. They do distribute also the sortes of religions, to yt which they make Iupiter Caldees, with the sonne of the Egyptians, with Venus of the Sarrasins, with Mercurie of the Christians, with the Moone that religion of Antichrist to come: and that Moses by reasons of Astrologie did institute the Sabboth daie of the Iewes, and that therefore the Christians haue erred, who accordinge to the custome of the Iewes do not kepe holy the Sabboth day, abstaining from labour, seing that is the day of Saturne. They beleue also that the fidelitie of euery man may be knowne aswell to man as God, and professed religion, and the secretes of conscience of the part of Sol and of the thirde, ninth, and twelfth house of the Heauens, and to knowe also the thougthtes, and as they saie, the intentes of men. Many geue many rules, and do appointe the configurations of ye heauenly bodies as causes of these miraculous workes of the deuine prouidence, as that is, of ye vniuersal floud, of the Lawe giuen by Moses, and the deliueraunce of the Mirgin, and foolishslie do babble that the death of Christe redemer of mankinde was the worke of Mars. And also that Christe himselfe did vse the election of howers in his miracles, in whiche the Iewes coulde not hurte him, whileste he wente to Ierusalem: and therefore that he saide, when his disciples did forebidde him. Is it not twelue of the clocke? They saie moreouer, that if any shall haue Mars happily placed in the ninthe house of the heauens, that he shal haue power to driue awaye Deuils with his onely presence from them that be possessed: and he that shal praie to God, when he findeth the Moone and Iupiter ioyned with the Dragons heade in the middest of the heauen: that be shall obtaine, what so euer he aske: and that Iupiter and Saturne dothe giue blessednesse of the life to come. But if any in his natiuitie shal haue Saturne happely placed in Leo, his soule after this mortall life, free fro innumerable trobles, enclined to God, shall returne to heauen, and to his originall beginninge. And notwithstanding to these accursed trifles, & moste damnable opinions not without infamie of Heresie haue subscribed Peter of Appona, Roger Bacon, Guido, Bonatus, Arnolde of Villa noua Philosophers, the Cardinal of Alia a diuine, and many other Doctours of christian name, and do presume to witnesse, and maintaine that they haue proued these thinges to be true. Iohn Pico so great abundaunce, that skarsely he hath let passe one argumet, and so effectually, that vntil this daye not Lucius Balantius an earneste defendoure of Astrologie, nor any other maintainoure of this Arte hath benne hable to defende if from the reasons alleaged by Pico. For he proueth with very stronge argumentes, that it was not the iuuention of men but of the deuils of hell, the very whiche also Firmianus auoucheth, whereby they haue endeuoured and gonne aboute to cancel and abolishe all Philosophie, phisicke, the Lawes, and Religion. For firste it taketh faithe from Religion, it diminisheth miracles, it denieth prouidence: whilest that it teacheth all thinges to happen thorowe the force of constellations, and to depende vpon the Starres with a fatall necessitie: Furthermore it maintaineth vices, excusing them as though they did descende vpon vs from aboue: it doth empaire and subuerte al good Artes especially Philosophie, bringinge the causes of things from true reasons vnto fables, afterward chaunginge, Philicke from natural and effectual remedies into vaine obseruatios, and damnable superstitions & deadely bothe to the soule and bodie. Moreouer altogeather treading vnder foote the lawes, the customes, and euery Arte of mannes wisdome, for so muche as of Astrologie alone counsaile is asked, at what time with what cosideration, and by what meanes any thinge shoulde be donne, and shee alone beareth rule ouer life, customes, ouer common & priuate affaires, as if it had authoritie ouer all thinges from heauen, and al other thinges that did not acknowledge this for patronesse were thought vaine. A passinge Arte no doubte, which in times past deuils did professe to deceaue menne, and to do iniurie so the diuinitie. Ouer and besides this also the Heresie of the Manichees, which altogeather denieth and taketh awaye the libertie of free will hath had his beginninge from no where els, then of the false opinion and doctrine of the Astrologers concerning destinie. But of the same fountaine did the Heresie of Basilides springe, who saide, that there were three hundreth three scoare and fiue heauens made togeather by succession and likenesse, and the shewinge of these to be the number of daies of the yeare, assigninge to euery of them certaine beginninges, vertues, and Angels and deuising names for them: & the chiefest of al to be Abraxas whiche woorde in Greeke containeth in it CCClxv. as many truely as there be places of the heauens found out and inuented by him. Wee haue writen this bicause ye maye vnderstande, that Astrologie is also the mother of Heretickes. And as the most famous Philophers do hisse at this diuininge Astrologie, so Moses, Isaie, Iob, Ieremie and other Prophetes of the Olde Iestamente, and Augustine emonge the Catholike Doctoures thinketh good that it be put out of Christian Religion. Basile & Cyprian do laugh at it, Chrysostome, Eusebius, codemne it: it was excommunicated also in the counsaile of Martine and by Gregorie, Iohn, & Alexander the thirde Pope of Rome, and punished by the Ciuil Lawes of Emperoures. Amonge the Aunciente Romaines, when Tiberius, Vitellius, Dioclesian, Constantine, Gratiane, Valentiniane, bannished and punished: and by Iustinian also condemned vnder payne of beheadinge, whiche thinge maie be seene in his Code. This place puffeth me in minde also to speake of other Artes of Diuination: whiche do not so muche prophecie and pronosticate by the obseruation of heauenly as earthly thinges hauinge a certaine shadowe and imitation of heauenly thinges: to the end that when ye haue vnderstoode them, ye may the better knowe this Astrologiall tree, whiche bringeth foorthe like fruite: and out of whom is spronge a monster with many heades, as it were Hercules Hyder reckened Phisiognomie, Metaposcopie, Chiromancie, Geomancie, (whereof we haue also spoken before) Augurations, Speculatories, the interpretation of dreames, and the Oracles of mad men. But yet al these skilles haue no found doctrine, nor are grounded vpon any one certaine reason, but searche out hidden thinges either by aduenturous chaunce, or by the mouinge of the minde, or by certaine apparaunt coniectures, whiche be taken of dayly obseruations, and of a longe time, for all these monstrouse Artes of Diuination are wonte to defende themselues with nothinge els, but with the title of experience, and to ridde themselues out of the snares of obiections, as often as they teache and promise any thinge exceedinge the truthe, and contrarye to reason: of al whiche in this manner it is commaunded in the lawe: let there be founde none emonge you, that doth purge his sonne, leadinge him thorow the fiere: nor yt asketh counsaile of soothsaiers, or els obserueth dreames and Diuinations by birds: neither let him be a witch, nor inchauntour: bicause the Lord doth abhorre these things. Phisiognomie therefore folowing the nature of these Artes as guide (as shee saithe) doth presume that shee is able to finde out with probable signes, by vewing of the whole bodie, the dispositions of the minde & body, what mans fortune is, according to that she pronounceth this man a Saturniste, or Iouialist, that man a Martialiste, or Solist, an other, a Venerean, a Mercurialist, or Lunist, & by the forme and state of the bodie doth finde out their ascendentes passinge by little and little (as they saye) from the effecte to Astrological causes, by the which she afterwarde dalieth vpon whatsoeuer shee listeth. Metoposcopie also doth auaunte that she can foretel al mens beginninges, proceedinges, and endinges with a very sharpe wit, and learned experience, by the onely beholding of the foreheade: she naming herselfe also a nourished member of Astrologie. Chiromancie dothe facion in the palme of the hande seuen mountaines, accordinge to the number of the planetes: and supposeth that shee is able to knowe, by the lines, which be there seene, what complexion a ma is of, his dispositions, his life, and fortune, by a certayne harmonicall agreemente of the lines, as by certaine celestial markes imprinted in vs there by God and nature, 63 man may knowe his workes: although in deede the diuine Prophete spake not in that place of the Uanitie of Chiromancie, but of the libertie of Freewil. Moreouer the foresaid diuinours do defende themselues, that although they cannot geue iudgemente of the dispositions or inclinations by the causes of thinges, yet by signes printed by them, or the like causes, which alwayes are semblable in that same thinges, and like to like: and they saye that Pythagoras vsed in time paste these Artes, who gaue iudgement of the customes, natures, and the wittes of younge menne by the face and countenaunce, and preportion of all the bodye: and whome he iudged apte and sufficiente, him he tooke to be his Scholler. Philostrates Notwithstandinge it is not needeful for vs to striue againste the Erroure of this Arte with anye other reason then this, to weete that they haue not in them anye reason. Yet verye manye of the Auncientes exceadinge graue menne haue writen of these thinges, Hermes, Alchindus, Pythagoras, Pharaotes the Indian, Zopirus, Helenus, Ptolomee, Aristotle, Alphorabins, besides these Galene, Auicenna, Rasis, Iulian, Maternus, Loxius, Philemon, Palemon, Constantine, Africane, and finally of the Romane Priaces, Lucius Scilla, sorte Peter of Appona, Albert the Dutcheman, Michaell Scotte, Antiochus, Bartholmewe Cocles, Michaell Sauonarola, Anthonie Cermison, Peter many other famouse Phisitians: notwithstandinge they al can shewe nothing, beside coniectures, and obseruations of experience: and that in these coniectures, and obseruations there is founde no rule of truth, hereof it maie be seene, because they are voluntarie sayninges, and vpon whom the very teachers of them, men equall in learninge and authoritie doo not agree. Wherefore they doo greatly dote & are deceaued, whiche by these signes, without the complexion of the bodie and dispositions of nature, will foretell also the very conditions, and affections of Fortune, and the minde: whiche thinge lette that cause you beleue, whiche Appion the Grammarian lefte writen of a certaine man called Alexander, who did so passingly depainte the likenesses of Images, that by them the Metoposcoper hath tolde the yeares of death paste or to come, whiche thinge is not so muche incredible as impossible, that it maie be knowen by these Artes: but this trifle sellinge kinde of menne is wonte in suche wise to dote, thorowe the perswation of the Deuill of Hell, that they drawe them out of erroure into superstition, and from this by little and little into infidelitie. of Astrologie, whereof we haue spoken in Arithmeticke, whiche castinge certaine poinctes made by chaunce, or by a certaine force, of the whiche by certaine equall and vnequall numbers: facioneth certaine figures attributed to the heauenly signes, by whiche they Diuine. There is also an other kinde of Geomancie, whiche Almadal the Arabian introduced and brought in, the which doth diuine by certaine coniectures taken of similitudes of the crakinge of the Earthe, of the mouinge, cleauinge, swellinge, either of it selfe, or els of inflamation & heate, or of thundringes, that happen, the whiche also is grounded vpon vaine superstition of Astrologie, as that which obserueth howers, the newe Moones, the risinge and forme of the starres. Avgurie, whereof there be many kindes, is an Arte that in times paste was greatly obserued, and so muche estemed, that they did not, without the cousaile of the Augutes or soothesayers, accomplishe any thinge, whiche appertained to publike or priuate affaires. This Arte, as Pomponius Letus writeth, is very auncient, it came from the Caldees to the Greekes, emong whom Amphireus, Tiresias, Mopsus, Amphilotes, & Calcas were accompted good Augures or soothesayers, from the Greekes to the Toscans, from them to the Latines, and Romulus himselfe was an Augure, & ordained that Magistrates should be established with Auguries, and Dionysius saithe that the Arte of Auguringe was also muche set bie of the people Aborigines, and that Ascanius asked counsaile of the Augures before he wente into the fielde against Mezentius, whiche when he sawe prosperous, he fought, and vanquished. Finally the Phrigians, the Pisidians, the Cilicians, followed Auguries. The Lacedemonians also assigned an Augure to sitte with their Kinges in iudgement, and to be present at comon counsailes. The Romans had a colledge of Augures: and they whiche did purchase credite to this Arte, were they that taught, that certaine lightes of diuination did descende from the heauenly bodies vpon all these inferiour liuinge thinges, as certaine signes and tokens placed in their mouinge, standinge, gesture, goinge, fleing, voice, meate, colour, worke, and ende, naturally ingendred in them as it were by a certaine hidden force, and secreats consent & doo in such sort agree with the heauenly bodies by whose force they be moued, that they can after foretell al these thinges, what soeuer the Heauenly bodies haus intended to doo. Whereby it appeareth, that this diuination is grounded vpon nothinge but coniectures, taken partely, as they saie from the influences of the sterres, partly from some parabolical similitudes, then the which there is nothinge more deceiptfull: wherefore Panetius, Carneades, Cicero, Chrysippus, Diogenes, Antipater, Iosephus, and Philo do dispise it, and the lawes, & the Church the Eryptians, which in time past the Toscans, afterwarde the Romans, and yet at this daie the superstitious common sorte of men doth reuerence as woordes proceadinge out of Gods owne mouthe. thunder, lightning, & other impressions of the Elementes, moreouer monstruouse and straunge sightes seldome seene: yet with no other waie then by coniecture, and similitude, which verily there is no doubte, but that it dothe very much erre, because all these be naturall workes, & not prognosticall. Onirocritica, which is the interpretation of dreames cometh with the other, the interpretours whereof properly be called coniectours, as Euripides He that doth not coniecte amisse, a perfect Prophete compted is. To the which cunning also the great Philosophers gaue some authoritee, especially Democritus, Aristotle, and his disciple Themistius, and Sinesius the Platonian in suche wise groundinge them selues vpon these examples of dreames, whiche some chaunce hath made true, that for that cause they endeuour to perswade that nothinge is dreamed of in vaine: For they saie, that as the heauenly influences doo bring forth diuers formes in corporal mattier, so of the same influences, visions and dreames are printed in the fantasticall power, which is instrumental, with a celestiall disposition meete to bringe foorthe some effecte, and chiefly in sleepe, because the minde then free from bodily & outwarde cares, maie more freely receaue the heauenly influences, whereby many thinges are knowen to them that sleepe in dreames, which they that wake cannot see. They endeuoure therefore especialiy by this meane to winne true credite to these dreames. Yet concerninge the causes of dreames aswell inwarde as 64 attribute them to the fourmes, and engendred knowledges of the soule. Auicenna to the laste intelligence, that moueth the Moone, by ye meanes of that light, wherewith mens fantasies are lightned, when they are a sleepe: Aristotle doth ascribe it to the common sense, but fantasticall. Auerrois thinges: Alberte to the influence of the superiour bodies, so that there come certaine, formes betweene, which continually flowe downewarde from heauen: the Phisitians referre these to vapours, and humours: some to the affections, & thoughtes of watchinge: some Arabians to the power of vnderstandinge: some saie that it dependeth vpon the powers of the minde, and the influence of the heauen, and images and proportions of thinges togeather: the Astrologers woulde haue them caused of their constellations: others attribute their causes to the ayre, that compasseth & perceth. Furthermore Baldian and Arthemidore haue writen of the interpretation of dreames, and some Bookes are caried aboute vnder the name of Abraham, whome Philo in the bookes of Giauntes, and ciuill life affirmeth to haue firste founde out the interpretation of dreames, and others vnder the name of Salomon, meere dreames writen of dreames. But Marcus Tullius in his Book's of diuinations with very stronge reasons, whiche I will not reckon vp in this place, do the dispute againste the vanitee and folie of them, that gaue credite to dreames. But (which I had almost passed ouer) let vs also recke emonge these dreamers, them that geue credite of diuinitee to the prophecies of madde men, and doo beleue that they, whiche haue loste the knowledge of thinges presente, and the remembraunce of them that be paste, and all mans reason, haue attained to the diuine fore knowledge of thinges to come, and that whiche wise and wakinge men cannot see, madde men and them that are a sleepe see: as if God should be neerer to them, then to wise men, and them that, see, that vnderstande, and that consider before hande: Miserable doubtlesse be the men, that beleue these vanities, and obaie these deceites, that feede suche like Artificers, and make their wittes and faithe subiecte to their bellie. But what els should we thinke furie to be, then an altering of mans minde vered by the Deuilles of Hell, or by the Starres, or by the inferiour instrumentes drawen by vncleane Spirites? the which Lucane seemeth to haue expressed in this manner, when he bringeth in the Tuscane prophete Aruus: VVell learned in the lightninge leames, and in warme vaines the waie He dothe well know, and flighte of birdes that in the ayre doo straie. After that the Citie of Rome was purged, after the beaste was slaine for sacrifice, & after the entrailes were viewed, at the lengthe a potter vttered his opinion in these woodes: VVhat kinde of mischiefe oye Gods what plague do ye ordaine: The latter daies of many men shall ende on bloudie baine. If noysome starre of Saturne should, enkindle blackish fire: In Heauen aboue, with drowninge flouddes should Aquarie full dire. Haue filde the earth, and coured should haue ben with Seas the same: If Sol in cruell Leo were the worlde with firie flame Should burne on erie parte, and eke the aire enflamed mighte Haue with his Charrots ben ibrent. These cease to do their spighte But thou that doest meense, and feare with hote and flaminge taile The Scorpion fierce, and  65 Cleies also, why doest thou seeke t'assaile Vs Mars ? for milde Ioue lowe doth stande where as the Sunne dothe sette: And with him Uenus holsome starre in good aspect hath mette. 66 Cylen in mouinge swifte stands neare also to gentle Ioue : And Mars alone the Heauen hath and other Signes aboue. Forsaken haue their wonted waie, and goe aboute the skie: As not esteemed starres, and eke Orion maie yee spie VVith shininge swoorde girte to his side, greate rage of Armes is neare: And dinte of sworde shall put to flight all righte and aweful feare: Vice vertue shall accompted be and bide shall many yeare. Then al these skilles of diuination are rooted & grounded vpon Astrologie. For whether the bodie, face, handes, be viewed, whether dreame, moster, or Augu[illeg.]ene, or furie hath inspired, they will that a figure of the heauen be erected, by whose declaration, togeather with coniectures of sunilitudes & signes, thei goe aboute to searche out the meaninge of the significatours: and thus doo all diutnations require the Arte and vse of Astrologie, and confesse, that it is as a keye necessarie to the knowledge of all secretes. Wherefore all these Artes of diuination doo openly shewe themselues, how much they differ from the truth: because they vse so manifestly false principles, and faigned of a Poeticall rashnes: which although they are not, nor haue benne, nor shall be at any time: yet they woulde haue them to be causes and signes of thinges whiche are, attributinge to them the endes of thinges against the truthe ioygned and like to Astrologie, that he whiche professeth Magicke without Astrologie, doth nothinge, but wander out of the waie: Suidas supposeth, that Magicke toke name and beginninge of the Magusei. The common opinion is, that this is a Persian woorde, whereunto Porphirie and Apulei do assente, and that in their language it signifieth a Priest, a wise man, and a Philosopher. Magicke then comprehendinge all Philosophie, Naturall and Mathematicall, both ioygne also to them the forces of Religions. For this cause also it conteineth Geocie and Theurgie. Wherefore manye haue deuided Magicke twoo manner of wayes; that is naturall and ceremoniall. Men thinke that naturall magicke is nothinge els, but a singular power of naturall knowledges which therefore they cal the greatest profoundnesse of natural Philosophie, and absolutest perfection thereof, & sheweth what is the actiue parte of natural philosophie, whiche with the aide of naturall vertues, accordinge to the mutuall and conuenient of applyinge of them, dothe publishe woorkes excedinge all the capacitie of admiration: the whiche Magicke was muche vsed of the Egyptians, other thinges thereunto belonginge. They saie that Hierome made mention thereof, writinge to Paulinus, where he faithe, that Apollonius Tianeus Magitians were of this sorte which wente to worship Christ when he was borne visitinge him with giftes, whiche the interpretours of the Gospell doo expounde the philosophers of the Caldees, such as were Hiarchus emong the Brachmans, Thespion emonge the Gymnosophistes, Buda emonge the Babylomans, Numa Pompilius emonge the Romaines, Zamolxides emonge the Thracians, Abbaris emong the Hyperboreans, Hermes emonge the Egyptians, Zoroastes sonne of Oromasus emong the Persians. For the Indians, Ethiopians, Caldeans, and Persians were very excellente in this Magicke: wherin, as Plato saith in Alcibiades, the sonnes of the Persian Kinges were instructed, that they mighte learne to rule and gouerne theire common weale to the similitude of the worldes common Weale: and Cicero in his bookes of Diuination saith, that the Persians made no kinge, whiche had not firste learned Magicke. Naturall Magicke then is than, whiche hauing intentiuely behelde the forces of all natural thinges, and celestiall, and with curious searche sought out their order, doth in suche sorte publish abroade the hidden and secret powers of nature: couplinge the inferiour thinges with the qualities of the superiour at it were certaine enticementes by a naturall ioyninge of them togeather, that thereof oftentimes doe arise marueilous miracles: not so much by Arte as nature whereunto this Arte dothe proffer her selfe a seruaunte, when shee woorketh these thinges. For the Magitians, as very diligent searchers of nature, bringinge the thinges which he prepared by nature, applying and setting actiue things to passiue, very oftentimes before the time by nature appointed do bring foorth effectes, which of the common sorte be accompted miracles: wheras for all that they be but natural workes: nothinge els comming betweene but the foretakinge of time: as if a man in the moneth of Marche woulde cause Roses to spring, and ripe Grapes, Beanes sowen, or Persely within fewe houres to growe into a perfect plante, and greater, thinges then these, as Cloudes, Raine, Thunder, Beastes of diuers sortes, and infinite transformations of thinges, of whiche kinde Roger Bacon doth boaste that he hath done many with pure and natural Magicke. Of the workes therof haue writen Zoroastes, Hermes, Euantes King of the Arabians, Zacharie the Babylonian, Ioseph the Hebrewe, Rocus, Aaron, Zenotenus, Kirannides, Almadal, Thetel, Alchindus, Abel, Ptolomee, Geber, Zahel, Nazabarub. Tebith, Berith, Salomon, Astrophon, Hypparchus, Alcmeon, Apollonius, Triphon, and many others of whome somme woorkes be yet perfecte, and many fragmentes be yet extante, and sometime came to my handes. But of the latter writers fewe haue writen in naturall Magicke, and they fewe thinges: as Alberte, Arnolde of Villanoua, Raymonde Lullie, Bacon, Apponus, and the Authoure of the booke to Alphonsus published vnder the name of Picatrix, whiche notwithstandinge entermedleth much superstition with natural Magicke, whiche others haue done also. There be moreouer other very prudente and aduenturous searchers of nature, whiche, without natural vertues, with ye Mathematical disciplines alone, the influences of the heauens beinge put thereto, do premisse that they are able to bringe foorthe thinges like to the woorkes of nature, as bodies that go & speake, whiche for al that haue not the vertues of the soule: as the wodden doue of Architas was, which flewe, and the image of Mercurie that spake, and the Brasen heade forged by Albert the great, which as it is saide did speake. Boetius did excel in these thinges, a man of a passing profounde wit, and diuers learninge: to whome Cassiodorus writinge of these things, saith: Thou art determined to knowe difficulte matters, and to shewe miracles: with the passinge skill of thy Arte mettalles do belowe, Diomedes bloweth alowde in Brasse, the Brasen Serpente hisseth, birdes be counterfaited, and they that haue no proper voice be hard to vtter sweetnesse of songe: we speake fewe thinges of him, which coulde counterfait the heauen. I suppose that is spoken of these skilles, whiche Plato saithe in the xj. Booke of his Lawes: menne haue an Arte, whereby they brought foorthe certaine latter thinges, not partakinge of the veritie, & diuinitie, but made certaine semblaunces muche like to themselues: and the Magitians very presumptuous parsons haue gone so farre to do all thinges, especially with the fauoure of that auncient and terrible Serpent the promiser of scieces, that like to him, as Apes they endeuoure to counter faite God and nature. or Medicinall which is done with pacions, charmed drinckes for loue, and diuers poysoninge medicins suche a one as Democritus is reade to haue made, whereby happy and fortunate childerne maye be begotten, and an other whereby we maie well vnderstand the voices of birdes, as Philostratus certayne herbes of Pontus, sayde: VVith these, o Merim, haue I seene, ofte times a man to haue: The feareful shape as wilde wolfe, and him selfe in woodes do saue. Ofte times the ghastly ghostes to leaue, theire deape graues grown with grasse: And I haue seene the sowen feede. to place from place to passe. mans bodie, whiche the Arcadians offered to Iupiter Liceus, tasted the inwardes of a sacrificed child & was turned into a Wolfe, for the whiche transformation of men into Wolfes, Augustine thinketh that Pan was called with an other name Liceus, and Iupiter Liceus. The same Augustine doth recompt, that when he was in Italie, certaine women witches, like Circes: when they had geuen inchauntmentes in cheese to straungers they 67 trasformed them into horses, and other beastes of cariage and when they had caried the burdens, that they listed, againe they turned them into men: and that this chauced at that time to one Father Prestantius. But bicause any maye not thinke that these be dotages, and thinges impossible, let him remember that which the holy scriptures 68 and liued seuen yeeres with heye, at length through the mercie of God became a man againe, whose body after his death, Euilmoradath his sonne gaue to the rauens to be deuoured, leste at any time he might rise from death, who of a beaste became eftsoones a man. 69 speaketh, when he saithe: Thou haste hated them O God, because with inchauntmentes they did horrible woorkes. Further more I will haue you vnderstad this, that the Magitians do not onely searche out naturall thinges, but them also, whiche acompanie nature, and after a sorte do spoyle her, as are the mouinges, numbers, figures, soundes, voices, tunes, lightes, affections of the mind and woordes. Thus did the Psihes, and the Marsies call serpentes, other chased them awaye: in this wise did Orpheus with a hymne asswage the stormic tempest of the Argonautes Iasons copanions: and Homer saithe that Vlysses bloude was stented with woordes: & in the lawe of the twelue tables a paine was appointed for them, that had inchaunted corne: so that it is no doubt, that Magitians alone also with woordes and affections, and other lyke thinges oftentimes doo bringe foorthe some marueilous effect not onely in themselues, but also in straunge thinges: all whiche operations they suppose to spredde adroade vpon other thinges the force engraffed in them and to drawe these vnto them, or to put these from them, or to giue them vertue by some other meanes, as the lode stoane draweth Iron, and amber strawes, or as the Diamante and Garlike take away the vertue of the lode stoane: and so by this orderly and lincked composition ofthinges Iamblichus, Proculus, and Sinesius, accordinge to the opinion of the Magitians doo confirme that not onely the naturall and celestiall giftes but the intellectuall and heauenly also maie he receaued from aboue: the whiche Proculus confesseth in the booke of Sacrifice, and Magicke, to witte, that by suche consent of thinges Magitians were wonte to binde sprites. For some of them are fallen into so greate a madnesse, that they beleue, that with diuers constellations of Starres rightly obserued by distaunce of time, and with a certain order of proportions, by the consent of heauenly sprites, an image made maie receaue the sprite of life, and vnderstandinge, whereby he giueth answeare to them that wil demaunde any thing, and reueleth the secretes of hidden verity, Hereby it is manifest, that this naturall Magicke sometimes enclineth to Geocie, and Theurgie, oftentimes it is entangled in the craftes & errours of ye deuils of hell. grounded vpon the entercours of wicked sprites made with the rites of detestable curiositie, with vnleful coniuration, and with defensiue prayers, bannished & accused by the decrees of all lawes, Of this kinde be they, whiche at this daie, we call Necro mancers and Erchaunters. A people hatefull to the Lorde, well skilde to staine the skie, VVhich naught by nature be, and eke they can the thinges on hie Subuerte, as Starres and powers of thinges which firme and stable are For they knowe howe to staie the poles and flashinge flames sende farre, They driue the aire downe vnder earthe and mountaines rente and marre. These then be they whiche doe inuocate deade mennes soules, and they whiche the ancientes termed Epodi, that inchaunted childerne, and caused them to speake oracles, and whiche beare about counsaylinge or helpinge sprites as we reade of Socrates, and they whiche (as it is sayde) do feede sprites in glasses, by whom they auaunte to prophcie. And all these doo proceede in twoo manner of wayes. For some do endeuoure to coniure, and binde the beuill of hell especially coniured with a certaine vertue of the names of God: and truely seing that every creature doth feare and reuerence the name of his maker, it is no maruaile if the Geocians, & they also that be infidelles, Pagans, Iewes, Sarrasins, and men of euery wicked felowship and secte, doo binde Sprites with the inuocation of the name of God. Some other very horrible men whiche of a detectable wickednesse, and woorthy to be punished with fire, submittinge themselues to Sprites do sacrifice to them and woorshippe them and hereby they be made Idolaters & culpable of a very vile flattery, yet doo they offer themselues to manifeste daungers. For the deuils also beinge constrained do alwaies lye in waite to the ende that they maye deceiue vs goinge astraye. Out of the secte of these Geocians came all the bookes of darkenes, which Vlpiane the Lawier calleth the bookes of damnable readinge, and doth ordaine that foorthwith they should be ret in peeces. Such as one Zabulus is saide to haue first deuised given and enclined to forebidden artes, afterwarde one Barnabas of Cypers, and at this daye also there are bookes caried aboute with fayned titles vnder the names of Adam, Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Salamon, of Paule also, of Honorius, of Cypriane, of Alberte, of Thomas, of Hierome, many other men of a wicked witte. Furthermore they haue not onely made men, the Sainctes, the Patriarkes, and the Angelles of God authours of so detestable doctrine, but she we also the bookes written by Raziol, and Raphael, by the Angels of Adam and Tobie, which bookes yet doo openly declare to him that doth subtely consider the order of there preceptes, the vsage of their ceremonies, their kinde of woordes and charracters, their order of construction, their foolish phrase, to containe nothinge els but mere trifles, and falset, and to be made in these latter times by menne ignoraunte in aunciente Migicke, moste damnable artificers of damnation, of certaine wicked obseruations enterlaced and graffed in the ceremonies of religion, with many vnknowe names and signes, to the ende to feare rude and simple man, and to engender maruaile in fooles and in them, which know not good letters. It doth not therefore yet manifestly appeare, that these artes be fables: for excepte they were in deede and by means of them many marueilous & noisome thinges might be done, the Diuine and humaine Lawes woulde not so straightely haue commaunded that they shoulde be bannished from emonge men. And why these Geocians doo onely serue the Deuilles of hell, this is the reason, bicause good Angels doo hardly appeare, for they doo abide lookinge for Gods commaundement, and doo accompanaie with them onely whiche are cleane in hart and holy in life, but the wicked shewe themselues readye to inuocation, falsely fauouringe, and counterfaiting the Diuinitie, all wayes ready to deceiue men with theire subtletie, to be reuerenced, to be honoured, and bicause women 70 be more desirous of secretes and lesse aduised, and enclined to superstitions and be more easily beguiled therefore they sooner appeare to the, and do great miracles, as the Poetes speake of Circes, of Medea, Philosophers as Catholicke Doctoures, and Historiographers, and the holy Scripture also dothe testifie. For wee reade in the Bookes of the Kinges, that Phitonissa a woman, which was in Endor raised the soule of Samuel the Prophete although many doe interprete that it was not the soule of the Prophete, but a wicked sprite, which tooke his image. Notwithstanding the Masters of the Hebrewes saie, the whiche thinges also Augustine sprite of Samuell, whiche could easily be recaled before one yeare were paste after his departure from the body as the Negromancers affirme. But which is more the Negromantical Magitiens be of opinion that this maie be done by certaine naturall 71 forces and bondes, as we intreat in our Bookes of hidden Philosophie. And therefore the auncient Fathers skilled in spirituall thinges not without a cause haue ordayned that deade mens bodies should be buried in a holy place, and shoulde be accompanied with lightes, springled with holy water, perfumed with incense, & purged with praiers; as long as they were aboue ye earth: For as the Masters; of the Hebrewes saye, all our body and carnal creature, what so euer is grounded in vs vpon fleashely matier, is lefte to the Serpente for meate, and as they terme him Azazeli, whiche is lorde of fleshe and bloude, and Prince of this worlde, & is called in Leuiticus earth all the daies of thy life. And in Isaie: thy breade shalbe duste, that is to saie, our bodie created of duste of the earthe: duringe the time it shal not be sanctified, and chaunged into a better state, that it is no lenger the Serpentes, but is made Gods, that is to witte, spirituall of carnall, accordinge to the woordes of Paule, who saithe: Let that be sowen whiche is of the soule, and that shall arise whiche is spirituall. And in an other place. All truely shall arise, but all shall not be chaunged, because many shal remaine for a perpetuall meate to the serpent. We therefore laie aside this brutishe and horrible matier of the fleshe, and in death doo leaue it as a meate for the Serpentes, to receaue the same againe beyng chaunged into a spirituall and better state and condition, whiche shalbe in the resurrectio of the dead. And is alreadie come to passe in them, whiche haue tasted the firste fruites of the resurrection: and many haue attained the same in this life, by the vertue of the deified sprite, Enoch, Helias, and Moses, whose bodies beinge chaunged into the spirituall nature haue not seene corruption, neither as other carkaises be lefte in the power of the Serpente. And this is that contention of the Diuell with Michaell concerning the bodis of Moses: whereof Iude maketh mention in his Epistle: but wee haue sufficiently spoken of Geocie, and Necromancie. gouerned by good Angels, and by the diuine power, whereas yet oftentimes vnder the name of God, & the Angels it is bounde with wicked deceites of the Diuels, for not onely with naturall forces, but with certaine solemnities & ceremonies also, wee winne and drawe vnto vs heauenly thinges, and thorowe them the diuine vertues, of the whiche the auncient Magii ans hauing made volumes doo with many rules entreate. The greatest parte of all ceremonies consisteth in kepinge cleanelinesse, firste of the minde, afterwarde of the bodie, and of the things which are about the bodie, as in the skinne, in the apparell, in the house, in vessels, in housholde stuffe, in oblations, in sacrifices, whose cleanesse doth dispose men to the custome and earnest beholdinge of the heauenly thinges, and is greatly required in holy thinges, accordinge to the woordes of Isaie: Washe your selfes and be cleane, and forsake your naustie thoughtes. But vncleaness, whiche oftentimes corrupteth the ayre and infecteth man, deth disturbe that most pure influence of heauenly and diuine thinges, and chaseth awaie the cleane spirites of God. Notwithstandinge sometimes the vncleane spirites & the deceauinge powers doo require also this cleannesse that they may be woorshipped and adored for Goddes, & therefore we ought here to be very circumspecte, where of largely we haue spoken in our bookes of hidden Philosophie. But Porphirie, who doth muche dispute of this Theurgie or Magicke of thinges deuine doth finally conclude, that with Theurgicall consecrations mans minde maie be made apte to receaue Sprites and Angels, and to see the Goddes, but that by this Arte there may any man come to God, he altogeather denieth it. Of this schole are the Arte of Almadel, the Arte Notarie, the Arte of Paule, the Arte of reuelations, and many other thinges of like superstitions, which be so much the more damnable, as they appeare to the ignoraunt more diuine. The woordes of Plinie doo here come to my remembraunce, whoe faithe, there is an other kinde of magicke, which the Iewes saie that they receaued of Moses, and Latopea, the whiche woordes putte me in minde of the Cabala of the Iewes, whiche the Iewes doo constantly beleue that God him self gaue to Moses in the mounte Sina, and afterwarde was taught with the liuely voice alone by degrees of succession without writinge, euen vntill Esdras Thebs a Citie of Greece, taught the doctrines of Pythagoras, wherein the schollers bearing in minde their Maisters preceptes, did vse witte and memorie in steede of bookes, in like manner also some of the Iewes refusinge letters haue placed this in memorie, obseruation, and teachinge by monthe, wherefore the Hebrewes call it Cabala, as it were, a thing receaued by the onely hearinge of one from an other. The Arte (as it is saide) is very auncient, but the name is but of late knowen emonge Christians. They saie that it hath a double knowledge, the one of Bresith, the whiche is also called Cosmologia, that is to saie, that whiche declareth the forces of thinges created, naturall, and celestial, and whiche expoundeth with Philosophicall reasons the secretes of the lawe and Bible, whiche truely for this respecte differeth nothinge from naturall Magicke, wherein wee beleue that Kinge Salomon was verie exellente: For it is reade in the holy Histories of the Hebrewes that he was wonte to dispute from the Ceder of Libanus, fishes, al whiche thinges can shewe some Magicall force of Nature. Moses the fiue bookes, and many Thalmudistes haue followed this. The other knowledge of Cabala they call Demarcana, whiche contemplation of the diuine and Angelicke vertue of holy names, and signes, wherin the letters numbers, figures, thinges and names, and the prickes ouer the letters, the lines, the pointes, and the accentes, doo al signifie very profounde thinges, and great secretes. This againe they diuide in twoo partes into Arithmantia, that is to witte, that whiche is called Notoriacon, whiche entreateth of the Angelicke vertue, of the Names, Signes, also of the conditions of spirites & soules, & into Theomantia, whiche searheth out ye misteries of the diuine maiestie, the deriuations, the holy names, the pentacles, whiche he that well vnderstandeth they saie that he hath marueilouse vertues, so that when he pleaseth, he knoweth the thinges to come, he hath all nature at commaundement, he hath power ouer Deuils & Angels, and dothe miracles. With this they suppose that Moses wrought so many miracles, that he turned a roode into a Serpente, & water into bloude, that he sente Frogges, Flies, Lice, Locustes, fire with haile, blanes & sicknesse: that he caused to die all the firste begotten bothe of man and beaste, and leadinge his people to haue opened the Sea, that he made water springe out of a rocke, and quailes to come from Heauen, that he swetened sower waters, that he sente before his people in the daie lightninge, & clowdes, and in the night a piller of fire, that he caused the people to heare the voice of the liuinge God from Heauen, that he chastised the arrogant with fire, and them that murmured with the Lepre, that he punished the wicked with a sodaine slaughter, and caused other to be swallowed with the earth, that he fedde the people with the heauenly foode, that he appeased the Serpentes, that he cured them that were poysoned, that he preserued an infinite number from sickenesse, and theire garmentes from corruption, and made his people conquerours ouer his enimies. The Hebrewes saie moreouer, that with this Arte to fall from heauen vpon his enimies, and restored to life a dead childe: Daniel bounde faste the Lions mouthes, the three children did singe Psalmes in a burninge fornace. Moreouer the traiterouse Iewes doo also affirme that Christe by this Arte did oftentimes wonderfull thinges. And that Salomon was very wel learned, in this Science, and thereby wrote an Arte againste Deuiles, shewinge the manner to binde them, & coniure them, and charmes also against diseases, as Iosephus testifieth: But as I doubte not that God hath reueled to Moses and other of the Prophetes, many misteries not to be disclosed to the ignorant people, whiche were couered vnder the barke of the woordes of ye Lawe: so I know that this Arte Cabala, where of the Hebrewes doo so much boast, & I with great labour haue in times paste searched out, to be nothing els but a mere agreement of superstitio and a certaine Theurgical Magicke, but if, (as the Iewes doo boast) it proceeded fro God it should auaile to the perfection of life, to the saluation of men, to the honour of God, to the vnderstandinge of the truth: verely that spirite of truthe, whiche forsakinge the Sinagog cometh to teache vs all truthe, shoulde not haue hidden it from his Churche euen vntill these latter times, which truly hath knowen al things, which be of God, the blessing wherof, the Baptisme, and other signes of saluation are reueled, and perfect in euery tongue. For euery tonge hath a like and equal vertue, so that there be a like and equal pietie, neither is there any other name in Heauen, nor in Earth wherein we ought to be saued, and wherein wee maie worke well, besides the onely name of Iesus, in whome all thinges be summed and contained. For this cause the Iewes very well skilled in the names of God can woorke little or nothinge after Christe, as theire auncient Fathers were wonte. But that whiche we proue and see, oftentimes marueilous sentences of greate misteries to be taken out of the holy Scriptures, with the reuolutions (as they saie) of this Arte, al this is nothinge els, but a certaine sporte of Allegories, the whiche idle men busied in letters, pointes, and numbers, which this tongue and manner of writtinge dothe easily suffer, accordinge to theire pleasure doo forge and reforge, whiche although sometimes they signifie great misteries, yet they can not proue, nor shewe any thinge, but that accordinge to the woordes of Gregorie, we maie despise them with the same facilitie, wherewith they be affirmed. Rabanus a Monke hath fained many thinges with the like skill, but in Latine letters and verses, diuers images beinge put in emongest them, the whiche reade on euery side by all the proportions of the superficiall parte, and Images doo declare some holy mysterie representinge the Historie there painted, whiche thinges also that they maie be drawen out of prophane writinges noman is ignorant, whiche hath reade the chosen Uerses of Valeria Proba concerninge Christe, gathered out of the Uerses of Virgil: all whiche thinges be the studies of idle men. But as touchynge the workinge of miracles, I thinke not that any of you is in suche wise berefte of his witte, that beleueth that any Arte or Science maie be had of these. Therefore this Iewishe Cabala is nothinge els but a certaine moste pestilent superstition, where with at theire wil they doo gather, deuide, and transpose the woordes, names, and letters dispersed in the Scripture, and makinge one of an other doo vnbinde the members of the truthe, making here and there of theire owne deuisinge, communications, inductions, and parables: they will applie to them the woordes of God, defaminge the Scriptures, and sayinge that theire feigned matters be forged out of them, they doo malitiously inuey against the Lawe of God, and assaie to bringe in violent, and blasphemouse proufes of their traiterouse dealing, thorow reckenings of woords, sillables, letters, and numbers, & numbers impudently wrested. Furthermore beinge puffed vp with these trifles they auaunt that they are able to finde out, & knowe the vnspeakeable mysteries of God, & the secretes which are aboue the Scripture, by the whiche also they are not ashamed without blushinge to Prophecie, and to worke vertues and miracles, and with greate boldenesse to lie. But it fareth with them as with Esopes dogge, whiche lettinge his bread fal, and gapinge at the shadow therof, loste his meate: so this disloyall and stiffenecked generation of men, alwaies occupied in the shadowes of the Scripture, and with their artificiall, but superstitious Cabala runninge with great randon aboute these vanities, doth lose the breade of euerlasting life, and of truthe fedde with vaine woordes doth lose the woordes of truth. From this Iewishe heape of Cabalisticke superstition proceeded (I suppose) the Ophites, the Gnostickes, and Valentinian Heretickes, the which also with their Disciples haue inuented a certaine Greekishe Cabala, turninge topset downe all the misteries of the Christian saith, and with Hereticall wickednesse drawynge them to Greeke letters and numbers, doo make of them a bodie, whiche they call, of truthe, shewing that without these misteries of letters and numbers, the truthe in the Gospel cannot be founde out, because it is so diuers, and in some places contrarie to it selfe, and writen ful of parables, that they whiche see it doo not see, and they whiche heare it doo not heare, & they whiche vnderstande it doo not vnderstande, but to be sette before the blinde and the ignoraunt, accordinge to the capacitie of their blindnesse, and errour: and that the pure veritie hidden vnder it is beleued of the perfect forte alone, not by writinge, but by a successiue pronuntiation of a liuely voice, and that this is that Alphabetarie, and Arithmantical diuinitee, whiche Christe secretely shewed to his Apostles: and whiche Paule faith that he speaketh but emongst perfect men. For whereas these be bery high misteries, they haue not therefore ben writen, nor are writen, but are preuely searched out by wise men, whiche secretely keepe them in their mindee. And emonge them none is accompted wise, but he which can sorge very great monsters of Hereste. But let vs retourne to Magicke, wherof the Iuglers skil is a parte also, that is, illusions, which are onely done accordinge to the outwarde apparance: with these the Magitiens doo shewe vaine visions, and with Iuglinge castes doo plaie many miracles, & cause dreams, which thinge is not so much done by Geoticall inchauntmentes, and praiers, and deceites of the Deuill, as also with certaine vapours of perfumes, lightes, medicines, colleries, bindinges, & hangings, moreouer with ringes, images, glasses, & other like receites and instruments of Magicke, and with a natural and celestial vertue. There are many thinges done also, with a readie subteltie and nimblenesse of the handes, as wee dayly see stage players and Iuglers doo, whiche for that cause we terme Chirosophi, that is to saie, hande wise. There are bookes extant of the delusions or iuglinges of Hermes touchinge this skill, and of certaine others: we haue reade also that one 72 Pasetes a Iugler was wonte to shewe to straungers a very sumptuouse banket, & when it pleased him to cause it vanishe awaie, all they whiche sate at the table beings disapointed both of meate & drinke. We reade also that Numa Pompilius vsed suche like Iuglinges. Yea and 73 that he wrote with bloude in a glasse suche thinges as he thought meete, whiche when it was turned directly againste the newe Moone, shewed to them whiche stoode behinde him thinges writen in the circle of the Moone. Hereunto belongeth also whatsoever is reade in Poetes concerninge the transformation of men beleued of the Historiographers, and affirmed also of some Christian deuines, & of the holy Scriptures too. In this wise do men appeare Asses, Horses or beastes other to enchaunted eyes, and that with a naturall Arte. Sometime also these thinges are done by good & il sprites, either at the prayers of good men from God, as we reade in the holy scriptures of Elizeus Dothain aboute. But these thinges cannot deceaue the eyes whiche be pure and opened by God: so that a woman, which of the common people was sudged a beaste, seemed to Hilary no beast, but a woman as she was: such thinges then, which in this sorte are donne accordinge to the outwarde apparaunce be called delusions or iuglinges, but of such thinges as be wrought by the Arte of them, which doo chaunge and transforme, as of Nabuchodonosor, and of corne transported from one fielde into an other, wee haue spoken before: but of this Arte of delusions or iuglinges, Iamblicus speaketh in this wise: The thinges, which the deluded and bewiched personnes do imagine, haue no truthe of action and beinge, saue onely thinges imagined, For the ende of this skil is not to doo simplely, but to strethe out imaginations euen vnto appeaunce, of whiche there shall afterwarde no signe appeare. By these thinges then whiche are already spoken, it is euident, that Magicke is nothinge els, but a containinge of Idolatrie, Astrologie, and superstitious Phisicke. Of the Magitiens also is spronge in the Churche a greate route of Heretickes, whiche as Iamnes and Mambres haue rebelled against Moses, so they haue resisted the Apostolike truthe: the chiefe of these was Simon the Samaritane, who for this Arte had an image erected at Rome in the time of Claudius C aesar with this inscription, to Simon the holy God. His blasphemies be writen at large by Clemente, Eusebius, and Iren aeus. proceeded by many successions Valentinians, the Cerdonians, the Marcionistes, the Montanians, and many other Heretikes, for gayne and vayne glory speakinge lyes againste God, auaylinge nor profitinge men, but deceiuinge, and bringinge them to ruine and destruction, and they whiche beleeue in them shalbe confounded in Goddes, iudgemente. I being also a yonge man wrote of Magicall matters three bookes in a sufficiet large volume, whiche I haue entituled of hidden Philosophie, in whiche bookes whatsoeuer was then done amisse thorough curious youth, now beinge more aduised I wil that it be recanted with this retractation, for I haue in times paste consumed very much time and substaunce in these vanities. At the length I gotte this profit thereby, that I knowe by what meanes I shoulde discourage and dissuade others from this destruction. For all they that presume to diuine and prophecie not in the truthe, not in the vertue of God, but in the elusion of deuils, according to the operation of wicked sprites, and exercisiug deceits of Idolatrie, and shewinge illusions and vayne visions, the whiche sodainely ceasinge, they auaunt that they can woorke miracles, by Magicall vanities, exorcismes, inchauntments, drinkes of loue Agogimes, and other diuelish, woorkes, al these with Iamnes and Mambres and Simon Magus shalbe condemned to the paynes of euerlastinge fire. But it is nowe more then time to goo to further matters, and to trace out the opinions of Philosophie, the thinges whiche searche nature, and the sciences, whiche with subtill sillogismes seeke out the beginnings and endes of thinges. Whiche truely no man knoweth what other certaintie they haue besides the credite of theire teachers. The Poetes firste professed this, of the were the firste inuentours. What truth can then Philosophie giue vnto vs, sithe it tooke beginninges of the trifles and fables of Poetes? the whiche Plutarche proueth to be true with manifeste declarations, to weete, that al the sectes of Philosophers had their beginninge of Homer, and Aristotle himselfe confesseth that naturally Philosophers are studious of fables. Some doo diuide the Philosophers into nine, some into ten sectes, but Var ro hath diuided them in a farre greater number. But if any will assemble togeather all the Philosophers, neuerthelesse it cannot be knowne emonge them, which ought to be called the better secte, and to whose opinions wee should rather obey: they doo so muche striue and disagree emong themselues in all thinges, and doo maintaine this perpetuall strife, from age to age: and as Firmiane saith, one secte will subuerte an other, that shee maye establish herselfe and her doctrines, neither any doth graunt that the other hathe knowledge, leste that shee confesse that shee is ignoraunt. And although Philosophie disputeth and iudgeth of all thinges, yet shee is certaine of nothinge: wherefore I knowe not whether I shoulde accompte Philosophers emonge beastes, or emonge men: they seeme to surmount brutish beastes bicause they haue reason and vnderstandinge: but how shall they be accompted menne, whose reason cannot perswade no constant and certaine thinge, but doth alwayes wauer in mutable opinions, whose vnderstading doubtful at euery matter knoweth not what it shoulde holde or folowe, and that this is true we will nowe at large declare. There is a very greeuous battaile fought emong the grauest Philosophers concerninge the Principles of naturall thinges whereupon all this science is grounded, and yet the matter is before the iudge, they alleage persuadinge and inuincible reasons of contraries, 74 wise man by the Oracles of Apollo, woulde, that all thinges shoulde be made of water. Anaximander his auditour and successoure in the schole, sayde, that the beginninges of thinges be infinite: Anaximenes his scholler affirmed that the ayre was an infinite beginninge of thinges: Hypparchus, and Heraclitus Ephesius, the fiere: to these after a sorte doo Archelaus the Atheniane, and Anaxagoras the Clasomeniane agre, that the beginninges were infinite as it were certayne small and confused partes, but afterwarde set in order by the will of God. Xenophanes hotte and colde, as the fiere which moueth and the earth which facioneth: Leucippus, Diodorus, and Democritus, the full and the empty. Diogenes the free sayd, that it was the aire, which hath yet in it the diuine reason. Pythagoras the Samiane, woulde that number should be the beginning of thinges vnto whome agreeth Alcmeon Crotoniates. Empedocles the forme conceiued in the minde, and the matiere. Zeuo, God, the matiere, and the Elements, Aristotle, the matiere to the appetite of the forme by priuation, whiche he placeth the thirde emonge the beginninges, contrarye to that whiche he hathe taught in an other place that woordes of diuers significations shoulde not be reckened, wherefore some Peripatetikes of latter time, in place of priuation haue set a certaine mouinge, that gathereth bothe togeather, which sith it is accident, howe shal it be the beginning of substaunce: or who shalbe the mouer of that mouing? therefore the Philosophers of the Hebrewes haue determined that matiere, forme, and life are the beginninge of thinges. there was but one worlde, and the same to be made by God: Empedocles in like manner one, but that it was onely a small parcell of the whole. Democritus and Epicurus helde the contrarys that there were infinite worldes, whome Metrodorus their scholler folowed sayeinge, that there are innumerable worldes bicause the causes of them be without number, and that it is no lesse folie to saye that in the vniuersall is but one worlde alone, no otherwise the one eare of corne to grow in a fielde. Aristotle, Auerrois, Cicero, and Xenophanes say that it is euerlastinge, and that it shal neuer sustaine corruption. For seing that they cannot perceiue (as Censorinus saithe) whether the egge or the birde be firste engendred, seinge that it is not possible that an egge should be layde without a birde, and a birde begotten without an egge: for this cause they haue beleued that this world, and the beginninge and ende of euerye begotten thinge was euerlastinge with a perpetual reuolution. Pythagoras and the Stoickes haue sayd that it was made by God, and that sometimes asmuch as is of his nature shalbe cosumed: to the whiche Anaxagoras, Thales, Hierocles, Auicenna, Algazel, Alcmeus, Philo the Hebrewe doo conseat, but Plato affirmeth, that it was wrought by God according to his owne example, & neuer to haue end. Epicurus teacheth that the world was once made, and shal once be destroyed, and neuer be repared againe. Empedocles and Horiclycas the Ephesiane affirme that the worlde not once but alwais is made and destroied. But let vs entreaty a little of an other particuler thing, which they saie dothe specially proceede of some natural cause, aire is the cause thereof, Empedocles the fiere, Democritus and Thales Milesius the water: Aristotle, Theophraste, and Alberte the winde of vapour vnder the earthe: Asclepiades chaunce or ruine. Possidonius, Metrodorus, and Calisthenes the Ladies of destinie. Seneca and others beinge diuided into diuers opinions haue in vaine searched out the cause of that effecte: therefore the ancient Romains when they perceiued or worde was brought them that the earth quaked, they commauded holy daies to be kept but they published not for what God they shoulde be obserued: bicause it was then vncertaine by what force or by what God the earth quaked. But if we wil vnderstande of them anye thinge touchinge the Soule, they doo muche lesse agree: For Crates the Thebame saith that there is no soule, but 77 that the bodies be so moued by nature. But they whiche haue confessed the soule, many of them haue thought it to be a very subtil body spreade in this grosse body, but some of them haue sayde it to be firy as Hipparchus and Leucippus, with whiche after a sorte the Stoickes doo agree, saieinge that the soule is a very hotte sprite, and Democritus saithe that it is a moueable and firy spirite put betweene the Atomi, that is, vndiuidible parts. Other haue sayde that it is the ayre, as Anaximes and Anaxagoras, Diogenes the Cinick, and Critias, to whome Varro doth assente sayeinge: the soule is the ayre receiued into the mouthe boyled in the lightes, tempered in the harte, and dispersed thorowe the bodye. Some haue sayde of water as Hippias. Other of the earthe as Heliodorus and Proponides, with whiche after a sorte doo agree Anaximander and Thales Other of the earthe and the fiere as Permenides. Other of bloud, as Empedocles, and Circias. Other a thinne spirite dispersed thorowe oute the bodie, as Hyppocrates the Phisition. Some, fleashe with the exercise of the senses, as Asclepiades. Manye other also haue beleeued, that the soule is not that small bodye, but a certayne qualitie and complexion thereof spreadde thorowe euery parte thereof, as Zeno Cithicus: and Dicearchus defineth the soule to bee the complexion of the foure Elementes: and Cleanthes, Antipater, and Possidonius saye that it is heate or a botte complexion, to whom Galene ye Pergamenaine doth agree. Thex bee other also, whiche haue sayde, that the soule is not that qualitie or complexion, but resident as it were at some point thereof in some certayne part of the body, as in the hart, or in the brayne, from thence gouerninge the whole body, in the number of whiche are Chrysippus, Archelaus, and Heraclytus Fonticus, whoe sayde that the soule was lighte. There are others besides, whiche haue beleeued that the soule is a certayne more free thinge, as some free pointe bounde to no parte of the bodye, but secluded from all determinate setlinge of the bodye and wholy presente at euery parte of the bodye, whiche whether complexion hathe begotten, or God created, is not withstandinge come out of natures lappe. Of this opinion were Xenophanes, Colophonius, Aristoxenus, and Asclepiades the Phisition, who sayde that the soule was an exercising togeather with the senses, and Critolaus the Peripateticke soule was an vnquiete nature, mouinge herselfe. And Xenocrates called it a number mouinge itselfe: whome the Egyptians doo followe, sayeinge that the soule is a certayne force passinge into all bedyes: and the Caldees would haue it to be a vertue without a determinate forme, the whiche yet receaueth into it all straunge formes: al truely doo agree in this, that the soule is a certayne nimble force to moue, or els to be a certaine highe harmonie of the bodyly partes, but yet dependinge vpon the nature of the body. And the diuelish Aristotle foloweth theire steppes, who finding out a newe woorde calle the Soule Eutelechia, that is to witte, the perfection of a naturall instrumentall bodye, hauinge life in power, the whiche perfection geeueth it beginninge of vnderstandinge, feelinge, and mouinge. And this is the feeble definition of so an approued Philosopher concerninge the soule, whiche dothe not declare the substance, nature, or beginninge thereof, but the affections thereof. Furthermore there are besides all these, others which haue sayde that the Soule is a certayne Diuine substaunce, whole and not to be deuided, and presente to all and euery parte of the body, in suche wise proceeded from the incorporall maker, that it dothe depende on the onely vertue of the worker, not on the lappe of matier. Of this opinion were Zoroastes, Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Aglaophemus, Pythagoras, Eumenius, Hammonius, Plutarch, Porphyrius, Timeus, Locrus, and the Diuine Plato whoe sayde that the soule was a beinge or a substaunce whiche moueth it selfe endewed with vnderstandinge. Eunomius the Bishep agreeinge partely with Aristotle, partely with Plato, defineth the soule to be an incorporall substaunce made in the body, vpon the which definition he afterwarde grounded his opinions. Cicero, Seneca, and Lactantius saye, that menne are altogeather ignoraunte what the soule is. Beholde you see howe muche they disagree emonge themselues concerninge the substaunce of the soule, and doo no lesse ridiculouslye varye emonge themselues aboute the seate thereof: for Hyppocrates, and Hierophylus Erasistratus in the vppermoste skinne of the brayne. Strato, Diogenes in the hollowe vaine of the harte. The Stoickes and Chrysippus, in all the harte, & breath whiche is aboute the harte. Empedocles in the bloud, vnto whom Moses doth agree, who hath for that cause forbad men to eate bloude, because the life of a liuing thinge is therein: Plato, Aristotle, and the other noblest Philosophers, in all the body, but Galene supposeth that euery parcell of the bodie hathe his soule, for in this wise he speaketh in his booke of the vtilitee of partes: there are also many partes in liuinge thinges, some greater, some lesser, and some not able all manner of waies to be diuided into the likenesse of liuinge thinges, but necessarily euery soule standeth in neede of all these: for the bodie is the instrumente thereof: and therefore the partes of liuinge creatures doo much differ one from an other, because the soules doo. I doo not thinke good in this place to passe ouer the opinion of Beda the Diuine, who writinge vpon Marke saith, the principall place of the soule is not, as Plato saithe in the braine, but accordinge to Christe, in the harte. Concerninge the continuaunce of the soule, Democritus and Epicurus affirme that it is immortall, and going out of the bodie, fleeth to ye nature of his kinde: The Stoickes standinge as it were in the middest betwene these, saie that the soule doth forsake the body in such sorte, that the soule whiche is diseased in this life, and auaunced with no vertues dieth togeather with the bodie: but if it be adourned with Heroicall and noble vertues they suppose that it shalbe accompaigned with euerlastinge natures, and enter into the highest dwellinges. Aristotle saithe that some partes of the soule, which haue corporal seates, be vnseperable from them, and die togeather with them: but that the vnderstandinge, whiche hath no instrument of the bodie, as perpetuall, is seperated from that whiche is corruptible, but he speaketh so couertly and doubtfully, Aphrodiseus saith plainely, that here, by he hath made the soule mortall, of the same opinion emonge our men is Gregorie Nazianzene. Against these is Plato, and of the Christians Thomas of Aquine is at daggers drawinge in the defence of Aristotle, & saith that he hath thought well touchinge the immortalitee of the soule. Auerrois that woorthy commentour vpon Aristotle supposeth, that euery man hath a proper soule, but mortall, but yet that mans minde, or let vs call it vnderstandinge, is euery where bothe before and behinde, euerlastinge: but that all men, or mankinde haue one, whiche onely we should vse in our life. Themistius saithe, that Aristotle hath sette out one onely actiue minde, but the same capable and manifolde, and hath made bothe perpetuall. 78 Moreouer it is come to passe by meanes of these Philosophers, that also emonge Christian deuines there is growen a discorde touchinge the beginning of soules, some of which saie that the soules of all men were made in heauen from the beginninge of the worlde, emonge whom of many there is one Origines a very well learned man. Augustine also supposeth that the soule of the first parente toke his beginning with the heauely creatures, and that it is more auncient then the bodie, and that after he had considered and behelde a dwellyng place meete for him selfe, he chose it willingly, albeit he semeth not to affirme this very constantly and boldely. Some suppose that one soule is begoten of an other, as a bodie of a bodie, in whiche opinion Apollinaris againste whose Heresie Hierome doth strongly dispute. Some saie that all soules be dayly created: these doth Thomas of Aquine follow fightinge with a peripateticall argument in this manner: that sith the soule is the forme of the bodie, shee ought not to be created aparte, but in the bodie: the which opinion is already well neere approued of al the schole of the diuines of late time: I let passe the degrees of soules, their assendinges, and descendinges, whiche the Origenistes haue brought in, but not maintayned by the holy Scripture, nor agreeable to Christian doctrine: so that there is no certaintee neither emonge Philosophers, nor emong deuines touchinge the soule. For Epicurus and Aristotle make it mortall: Pythagoras leadeth it aboute. And there are some (as Petrarcha saithe in a certaine place) which draw it to his bodie: there be also some which spreade it vpon the bodies of liuinge thinges, there be other which restore it to heauen, there be some which constraine it to goo wandring about ye earth, some put it into Hell, other denie it, there be of these whiche would haue cuerie soule to be created by her selfe, other whiche thinke that they were al created togeather: these be his woordes. There was Auerrois moreouer who presuming to speake some very marueilouse matter, made (as I haue saide) a vnitie of the vnderstanding. The Manichean Heretikes saide there was but one soule of all or vniuersall thinges dispersed into all bodies aswell liuinge as not liuinge: but that they did lesse participate whiche seemed vnto vs without soule, and more the liuinge, but muche more the heauenly: and so at length they conclude, that the particulare soules be but partes of the vniuersall soule. Plato also doth auouche that there is one soule of al the vniuersal: but others of the particulars, as who would saie that seuerally the vniuersall is liuinge in his owne life, and by them selues also the perticulars liue. Furthermore some doo affirme one kinde of soules, others not one but twoo, the reasonable and the vnreasonable: some, many, and so many as there be kindes of liuinge creatures. Galene the Phisition thinketh that diuerse soules be in diuerse creatures accordinge to the kinde, besides this he also placeth many soules in one bodie. There are also some, whiche make twoo soules to be in a man, the sensitiue of the begetter, the other intellectiue of the creatour: soule the other the vnderstandinge: and Apollinaris is of ye same opinion. Some make no difference betwene the soule and the vnderstandinge, but saie that it is the principal parte of the substaunce of the soule: but Aristotle thinketh that this is in power therein, and that by action it cometh vpon it from abroad and that it auaileth not to the nature and being of a man, but to the perfection of knowledge, and contemplation. And therefore he affirmeth that fewe and onely Philosophers haue that whiche is called vnderstandinge in action. And verily there is yet great disputation emong the Diuines, whether in dead bodies (whiche was the Platonians opinion) there remained memorie and perceauing of the thinges, whiche they haue donne and lefte behinde them in theire life time, or vtterly haue forgotten them, whiche thinge the Thomistes doo stifly mainetaine with their Aristotle, and the Carthusians doo establishe it with the example of that diuine of Paris retourned from Hell, who being demaunded, what he had remaininge of his knowledge, he answeared: that he knew nothinge but paine: and alleaging the saying of Salomon, there is no reason, no knowledge, no ritches in Hell, he seemed to them to conclude, that there remained no knowledge to ye dead. The which thinge is yet manifestly against not so much the opinion of the Platonians, as against the authoritee and veritee of the Scripture, seinge the Scripture saithe, that the wicked shal see and know, that he is God: yea moreouer they shal render an accompte also not onely of al their deedes, but also of their idell woordes and thoughtes. There are moreouer some whiche dare to write and declare many thinges of the appearaunce of soules, and thinges often times farre from the Guangelicke doctrine and holy Canons: and albeit the Apostle commaunded thei we ought not to beleue the Angels from Heauen, if that should declare any thinge contrary to that whiche is written, the Gospel in such wise abolished emonge them, that they doo sooner and rather beleue a dead man restored to life, then the Prophetes, then Moses, then the Apostles, & Euangelistes. Suche verely was the doctrine and opinion of the ritche man buried in Hell, who beleued that then his brothers whiche were aliue should beleue, if a dead man wente to them, & did beare witnesse to them. To whom thus beleuinge Abraham spake in the Gospel sayinge: If they beleue not Moses and the Prophetes, they will much lesse beleue, if one be sente them from the dead. I doo not yet therfore altogeather denie the holy appearaunces of the dead, the warninges and the reuelations: but I doo monishe you that they are to be muche suspected, sith that Satan very often chaungeth him selfe into the Angell of light, and counterfaiteth the likenesse of Soules: wherefore the Ancour of faith is not to be fastned on them, but they ought deuoutely to be accepted for edification, as other thinges whiche are not in the holy Canon, or the Apocriphes. There are caried aboute of these trifles many fabulouse Bookes, of Tundall, and that whiche is entituled, the Consolation of Soules, and others with whose examples, certaine preachers doo feare the ignorant people and get giftes of them. A certaine Frenche protonotarie, a lewde fellow and an abuser hath also writen not longe since, a fable of a certaine spirite of Lions. But emonge the commended writers, Cassianus and Iames of Paradize a Carthusian doo entreate of these thinges: yet there hath bene at any time no sownde truthe or hidden wisedome, which might edifie the saluation of our soules, reuealed by these apperaunces of soules: but onely Almesse deedes, Praying, and Fastinge, and other woorkes of Christian pietie haue bene perswaded: whiche thinges yet be farre better, and more auaileably taught by the holy Scripture, and commaunded by the Churche. Of these appearaunces I haue written at large in our Dialogue of man, and in the Bookes of hidden Philosophie: haue helde opinion that the Soule is immortall, with a common consent doo affirme the departure of the soules, and that reasonable soules goo into vnreasonable bodies, and euen vnto plantes for certaine spaces of time, or as otherwise it shall happen. It is saide that Pythagoras was the authour of these departures, whereof Ouide in his Transfigurations singeth in this sorte: The soules immortall are, and aie forsakinge theire first seate Receiued in they liue, and dwell in houses newe and greate. For I my selfe remember well in time of Troiane warre, That I Euphorbus was the Sonne of Panthus , in whom farre Did Menelaus in time paste, thrust in a weightie speare: I knewe the shielde whiche I did earst, in my leafte hande eke beare: Not longe agone in Argos towne, in Iunos temple there. Timon, Xenophanes, Cratinus, Aristophon, Hermippus, Lucianus, & Diogenes Laertius haue written many more thinges of this Pythagoricall passage or departure: but Iamblicus, and many other togeather with Trismegistus doo agree that the soules departe not onely from men to vnreasonable liuinge creatures, nor from them to men, but from vnreasonable liuing creatures, to other of that kinde, and from men to men. But there are also Philosophers emonge whome is Euripides the follower of Anaxagoras, and Archelaus first men grewe out of the Earth in manner of Hearbes: herein no lesse ridiculouse to the Poetes, which write emonge their Fables that certaine men grewe of the sowen teeth of Serpentes. There be whiche vtterly denie Generation: as Pirrho the Eliensian, and there be which denie mouinge, as Zeno. them. Cap. 53. But let vs goo farther and shewe that these Philosophers doo not onely contende for the thinges, which are in the nature of thinges, but also for the deuises of their imaginations, & for the thinges, which be grounded vpon no principels, neither is it certaine whether they be or not, as things which be thought to abide without bodie and matier, & by them termed, deuided formes: the whiche because they be not in the nature of thinges, but are supposed to be aboue nature, therefore they call them transnaturall or Metaphisicke: from hence haue spronge these infinite opinions and on euery side repugnante to themselues of the Godes, no lesse wicked, then vnlearned: For Diagoras is no God at all: But Epicurus saide that there was a God, but that he had no care of earthly thinges: Protagoras saide that it could not be knowen whether there were a God or not. Anaximander thought that the Goddes had a beginninge & endinge, & that in longe distaunce of time they were borne and died. Xenocrates saide that there were eight Gods. Antisthenes was of opinion that there were many populare Gods, but one naturall the greate artificer of the whole. But many of them fel into so great madnesse that they wrought with their owne handes the Gods whiche they woorshipped, as the image of Bel was emonge the Assirians, yet it is a wonder howe Hermes Trismegistus doth in his Esculapius extol these carued Gods. But they speakinge of the diuine substaunce, Thales the Milesian force endewed with reason, or els a deuine necessitie: Zeno, a diuine and naturall lawe: Anaxagoras an infinite minde moueable by it selfe. Pythagoras, a minde whiche is intentiue & goeth thorow the nature of all thinges, whereof al thinges receaue life. Crotoniates Alcmeon, saide that the Sunne, Moone, and the other starres were Gods. Xenophanes would haue al that which is to be God. Parmenides maketh God to be a certaine continuall circle of light, which they call Stephanen, that is to saie, a Corone. Aristotle as though a sufficient sure knowledge of the Gods mighte be had by the mouinge of the heauens, hath imagined the Gods to be of theire nature, and doth sometimes attribute the diuinitie to the minde, sometimes he saithe that God is the heate of the heauen, sometimes he maketh the world to be God, somtimes he maketh an other God presidente ouer it. Theophraste followeth him with the like inconstauncie. I leaue to speake what Strato, Perseus, Aristo the scholler of Zeno, Plato, Xenophon, Speusippus, Democritus, Heraclides, Diogenes the Babilonian, Hermes Trismegistus, Cicero, Seneca, Plinie, and the rest haue thought hereof, whose opinions yet doo not farre disagree from the firste, and alreadie recited. I mighte also renne ouer the residew of their debates, & monsters of woordes, of the Ideas, of the incorporals, of the vndiuisible partes, of Hile, of matier, of forme, of the emptie, of the infinite, of euerlastingnesse, of destinie, of the transcendentes, of the introduction of formes, of the matier of the Heauen, whether the starres be made of the Elementes, or of the quinte essence, whiche Aristotle bringeth in, and of other like thinges, which minister occasion of beleefe, of double & of contention to witlesse parsons, but I suppose that I haue made sufficient declaration howe muche the Philophers varie emong them selfes concerning the truth, the neerer vnto whom a man commeth, the further he goeth from the truthe, and swarueth from Christian Religion. For this cause wee knowe that Iohn the xxij. Bishop of Rome did erre: whiche would that ye blessed soules should not see the face of God before the day of Iudgement. We knowe that Iuliane being euer studious of Philosophie, beganne to skorne and contemne the basenesse of the Christian faithe. For the same cause Celius, Porphyrius, Lucianus, Pelagius, Arrius, Manicheus, Auerrois, and many other haue so barked againste Christe, and his Churche. Hereof is risen this prouerbe emonge the common people, That the greateste Philosophers are wonte 79 Patriarkes of Heretickes, and the firste begotten of Egypte, and the barres of Damascus, spoken as true as maye bee. For what Heresits so euer haue benne at any time, they al haue flowed out of the fountaines of Philosophie, as from theire firste seede plotte. Hereby all diuinitie 80 is wel neare corrupted, and in steede of euangelicke Doctours, false prophetes, Heretikes, & Philosophers are sprong vp, which haue made the holy Scriptures of God equal to the inuentions of man, and haue defiled them with the marueilous opinions of men and haue reduced the playne diuinitie (as Gerson saithe) to caueling and sophistical bablinge, and to the monstrous Mathematikes. The whiche Paule the Apostle forseinge doth so often exhort and bid vs beware, that none do not spoile and misleade vs thorow Philosophie. Augustine doth maintaine and defende the Churche of God from it. And well neare all the other diuines, & holy Fathers haue thought meete to bannishe it farre of and vtterlye to route it out of Christian schooles. Neither doo there wante examples of Pagans, whome we haue reade sometimes to haue donne the like. For the Athenians did put Socrates to deathe the father of Philosophie, and the Romaines bannished the neuer receiue them: and whiche is more, in the time of Domitiane they were bannished out of Rome, and also forbidden al Italie. There is extant also a decree of Kinge Antiochus againste younge men whiche presumed to learne Philosophie, and also againste parentes, whiche did allowe theire childerne to studie it. Neither were they onely condemned & bannished by Emperours, and Kinges: but in writen bookes reproued by very well learned men: in whose number are Phliasius, and Timon, whoe wrote a booke entituled Syllos comedy againste them, whiche is entituled the Cloude: and Dion the Prusean wrote a very eloquente Oration againste Philosophers. Aristides also wrote a very eloquent Oration againste Plato for the soure Nobles of Athens: Hortensius the Romaine also a very eloquente man and of a very noble familie inueyed againste Philosophie with very stronge reasons: but this sufficeth which is spoken. More ouer then this, if there be any Philosophie or Doctrine of manners, as some will, I suppose that this doth not so mutche consiste of weake reasons of Philosophers, as of diuers vse, custome, obseruation, & practise of common life, and that it is mutable according to the opinion of times, places, and menne, whiche with threatninges, and flatteries they teache to children, and to the elder sorte with lawes, and punishment, naturall industrie hath giuen some thinges to menne, which they cannot be taught: but thei take place by right or wrong, accordinge to the vse of time, and agreemente of menne: whereof it commeth to passe, that, ye whiche at one time was vice, an other time is accompted vertue: and that whiche in one place is vertue, in an other is vice: that whiche to one is honeste, to an other is dishoneste: that whiche to vs is iuste, to other is vniuste, according to the opinion, or lawes of time, of place, of estate, and of men. Emonge the Athenians it was leeful for a man to marry his owne sister: but that emonge Romaines was accompted a wicked acte: in time paste emonge the Iewes, and at this daye emonge the Turkes it is leefull for a man to haue many wiues, and concubines also: this emonge vs Christians is not so wicked as infamous and dishonest. It is accompted a prayse in Greece for yonge men to haue many louers. And finally emonge these nations it is no shame for men nor women to goo out vpon a stage and to be a spectacle to the people whiche thinges notwithstandinge emonge the Latines and Romaines were thought vile, infamous, and very dishonest. Yet the Romaines were not ashamed to cary theire wiues to bankets, and to bringe them into open assemblies, and to enhabite the formoste parte of the house, but in Greece the wise goeth not to bankettes excepte it be to theire kinsfolke, and vseth to be no wher but in the innermost part of the house, where no man commeth, excepte he be a very neare kinsman. The Egyptians, and the Lacedemonians accompted it a honorable thinge to robbe, emonge vs theeues are hanged by the necke vpon the gallowes. Iulius Firmicus in his Astrologikes writing to Lollianus saith: Some nations be so facioned by the heaue, that they be notable for ye singularitie of their proper manners. The Scythians doo 81 traiterously kill with horrible crueltie of beastly wildenesse. The Italians haue alwaies bene glorious in princely nobilitie. The Frenchmen, fooles. The Sicilians sharpe witted. The Asians, luxurious, & occupied in pleasures. The Spaniardes bee preferred before others in prowde boldnesse of bragginge. Euery nation hath a particulare difference of his manners giuen him from aboue, by the whiche the one is easily knowen from the other, that it is easily knowen of what nation one is borne by his voyce, by his speach, by his comunication, by his councel, by his his hatred, by his anger, by his warfarre, and other like exercises. For who is that whiche seethe a man goo with a cocke pase, with a swearinge gesture, with a fierce countenaunce, with a voyce like an oxe, with an vnpleasaunt speache, with wild manners, with leuse or plaited apparayle, that doth not iudge him to be a Germane? Doo not we knowe the Frenchemen by theire modeste goinge, by theire wanton gesture, by theire mery countenaunce, by theire pleasaunte voice, by theire gentle speache, by their modeste manners, and by theire gorgeous apparell? and the Spaniardes by theire goinge, by their manners, and by theire pleasaunt gestures, by theire loughtie lookes, by theire lamentable voyce, by theire trime talke, and neate apparel. Wee see the Italians go somewhat slowly graue in gesture, vnconstaunte in countenaunce slacke in their voice, captious in theire communication, noble in theire manners, and handsome in theire apparrell. Wee knowe moreouer that the Italians dee bleate in their singing, ye Spaniardes doo waile, the Germanes doo howle, and the Frenchemenne singe with pleasaunte tune and accente. The Italians be graue in theire talke, but craftie: the Spaniardes fine, but glorious: the Frenchemen ready, but proude, the Germans vnpleasaunt, but simple. In counsayles the Italiane is circumspecte, the Spaniarde, craftie: the Frencheman vnaduised, the Germane profitable, the Italiane is cleane in his fare, the Spaniarde delicate, the Frencheman aboundaunt, the Germane orderlesse: the Italians are louinge towardes straungers, the Spaniardes pleasaunt, the Frenchemen courteous, the Germans rude an vnapte for intertayninge, the Italians are wise in companye, the Spaniardes warie, the Frenchemen gentle, ye Germans imperious & intollerable, the Italians be ielouse in loue, the Spaniardes impatient, the Frenchemen lighte, the Germans ambitious. The Italians be secrete in their hatredes: ye Spaniardes constaunt, the Frenchmen menacing, the Germans, reuengers: the Italians are circumspecte in dooinge theire businesse: the Germans painefull, the Spaniardes vigilaunt, the Frenchemen careful. The Italians be valiant in the fielde, but cruell, the Spaniardes craftie, and greedy: the Germans cruel, and setters, to sale: the French: ecouragious, but vnaduised: the Italias excel in learning, the Spaniardas in nauigation, the Frenchemen in ciuilitie, the Germans in religion and handycraftes. And euery nation what soeuer it be either ciuill or barbarous hath his peculiare manners and customes geuen to them from the influence of the heauens, diuers from the other whiche cannot chaunce vnder any Arte, or Philosophie: but doo growe in men by a naturall vertue alone without any learning. But let vs tutne our talke to them, which haue put in writing the learning of these thinges. These doubtlesse hauinge don the dutie of the Serpet haue giue 83 vs that fruite by eating whereof we may learne to know good and ill. This is the firste nestilente opinion of them, whiche holde that the good and the ill shoulde be knowne, and by this meanes they saye, that men maye the better seeke vertue and shune vice. But howe muche more sure and profitable, and also howe much more happie should it bee, not onely not to doo euils, but altogeather to be ignoraunt of them also. Who is he that knoweth not, that thorowe this alone all wee were made miserable, when the firste parentes of mankinde learned what was good and what euill: but peraduenture Philosophers shoulde therefore be pardoned for this erroure, if they vnder the name of vertue and goodnesse did not also teache vs very wicked mischiefes & filthie vices. There are many sectes of them whiche haue entreated of manners, as the Academicke, the Cyrenaike, the Eliacke, the Megaricke, Philosophicallye in this manner, whoe as writers do make mention, was called a God to witte, the 84 wise shai giue his mind to theft, to adultry,  & to sacrilege, when time shal serue, for none of these vices is dishonest  by nature. But if the vulgare opinio be take away from them, which was made by the vilest sorte of fooles & ignoraunt persons, a wise man maye openly vse the company of Harlots without any shame to him being taken in the deede doing. There be other opinions of this diuine philosopher, then the whiche I wotte not if any thinge more dishonest maye be spoken, sauinge that masculine veneri 85 with a law made therupon, whiche luxuriousnes or Acte more the beastly is also renowned by Hierome the Peripateticke after this manner sayeing: that by the meanes therof many tirannies haue bene take away. But the woordes of Aristotle in his pollitickes, where he thinketh it auailable to the commo wealth, that the commo people should not haue many childern, be these: Many things hath the maker of lawes wisely & diligetly ordained for the temperaunce of meat, as a thing very profitable, and touching the deuorcemetes of women:to the end that they mighte not bringe foorthe a superfluous multitude, he commaunded that the companie of men shoulde be vsed. This is that Aristotle whose manners were reproued by Plato, whereof grew the hatred and vngratefulnes of him towardes his maister, whoe feearinge the Iudgemente of his wicked life prseuely and speedely sted from Athens, who beinge very vnthanekefull towardes his benefactours with the veninie of the Water of Stix flewe that greate Alexander, by whome he hathe bene so largely and nobly auaunced with authoritie and dignitie, and which had put his life, his body, and his soule into his handes and restoared his countrie. Whiche Aristotle also hauinge a false opinion of the soule, sayde, that after deathe there was no place of ioye: whoe hauinge robbed, and malitiously interpreted the sayeinges of the auncientes by thefte and false accusations gotte a prayse of wit, yea moreouer hauinge lewdly spente many good dayes, and thorowe the immoderate desire of knowledge fallinge madde flewe him selfe, beinge made a woorthy sacrifice for the deuils whiche taught him knoweledge: a very woorthy Doctoure doubtlesse at this daye of the Latine schooles and whome my diuines of Colene haue reckoned emonge theire sainetes, whiche haue made a boolte, and put him in printe with the title of the saluation of Aristotle: and an other also in verse of the life and deathe of Aristotle, whiche they haue expounded with a glose of diuinitie: in the ende of whiche booke they conclude that Aristotle hath bene the fore runner of Christe in natural thinges as Iohn that wee maye not goo farre astraye from the purpose, let vs heare, what the Philosophers thinke of felicitie and of the souerayne good: for some haue placed this in pleasure, as Epicurus, Aristippus, Guidus, Eudoxus, Philoxenes, and the Cyrenaickes, other haue accompted it in honesti diovned with pleasure, as Dinomachus, and Calipho, other haue placed it in the firste begotten of nature, as Carneades and Hierome the Rodiane: other in lacke of paine, as Diodorus: other in vertue, as Pythagoras, Socrates, Ariston, Empedocles, Democritus, Zeno Citicus, Cleanthes, Hecaton, Possidonius, Dionysius the Babyloniane, and Anthistenes, and all the Stoickes, and many of our diuines after a sorte agreeinge to them, doo hitherto dispute of the knitinge togeather of vertues, and what that common foundation of felicitie is wherein all vertues ought to agree. For excepte all vertues doo meete togeather, they neuer make a man blessed, yea if one alone shall wante. Then sithe the vertues bee emonge themselues vnlike, and after a sorte contrarye, liberalitie, and sparinge, Magnanimitie, and humilitie, mercye and iustice, contemplation, and carefull laboure in continuall woorke, and many other suche lyke, excepte they in agree in one, they cannot be nomore called vertues but vices. But Ambrose and Lactantius folowinge Plato in his common wealthe, thinke that to be iustice wherein they all ought to agree, other temperaunce whiche setteth a meane in all thinges, other pietye as Plato woulde in Epimenides, other charitie, without whiche theire is no profite in vertues as Paule thinketh, and hitherto dothe Thomas, Henrye, Scotus and others dispute vpon these thinges. But let vs retourne agayne: some haue put felicitie in fortune, as Theophraste: but Aristotle in fortune ioyned with the Primigenij, and with the vertues, but that is more, in pleasure, but painted with the goodes of vertues, as who woulde saye that Epicurus defendeth not his pleasure with these goodes, finally the other Peripatetickes, in speculation. Herillus the Philosopher, Alcidamus, good: but the Tiberinia people adioigninge to the Calibes of whome Apollonius and Pomponius haue made mention, sayde that lasciuiousnesse, and laughter, was the chiefeste felicitie. There are also some whiche haue put the soueraygne good in silence, but the Platonians withe theire Plato, felicitie with the soueraygne good in concorde. Bias of Priena in wisdome, and Boristhenes in prudencie, Thales Milesius in the layeinge togeather of these thinges. Pittacus the Miteleniane, in well doinge: Cicero, in immunitie from labour and businesse: but this cannot be founde but in God alone. I passe ouer the other meane Philosophers, whiche haue taken awaye all felicitie, as Pirrho of Elea, Euricolus, and Xenophanes, and them whiche haue placed the chiefest felicitie in glorye, in honoure, in power, in reste, in riches, and in suche like thinges, as Periander the Corinthiane, and Licophrone, and they of whiche the Psalmiste speaketh: whose mouthe hathe spoken vanitie, and theire righte hande is the righte hande of iniquitie. Whose sonnes are as yonge plantes in their youth: And their doughters adourned and trimmed like the Temple. Their store houses are full, voidinge from one into another: their sheepe are ful of younge abounding in lambes, and their Oxen fat. There is no ruine in theire headges, nor in the passingeire, nor crie of them in ye streates:They haue called the people blessed, whiche hath these thinges. They be in like manner in contrarie opinions touchinge pleasure, which (as you haue harde before) Epicurus thinketh to be the soueraigne God: contrarywise Architas of Tarentum, Antisthenes, and Socrates saie that it is the greatest euill. Speusippus, & some auncient Academickes haue saide that pleasure and sorrow be twoo euilles, the one set against the other, and that to be good which standeth in the middest of them, Zeno thought that pleasure was neither good nor euill but indifferent. Critolaus the Peripateticke, and Plato saie that pleasure is naught, and the baite nad parente of al euils. It should be too tediouse to recompte the opinions of all men touching felicitie, and to make a collection of these thinges, whereof others haue writen very many bookes: for Marcus Varro gathered togeather of these twoo hundreth rightie and right opinions, as Augustine saithe, and I suppose that I haue here sufficiently recited the moste famouse of them. But let vs now see, how these doo agree with Christe, and so it shalbe seene that we doo not gette felicitie, & blessednesse by the Stoicke vertue, neither by the Academicke purginge, neither by the Peripatetioke speculation, but by faithe and grace in the woorde of God. Ye haue harde howe some Philosophers haue placed felicitee or blessednesse in pleasure, but Christe in hunger and thirste, some in honour, fame, and greatnesse of name, but Christe in sclaunder, and hatred of men, some in the Primigenij, in health, in ioye, in lacke of paine: but Christ in weepinge, and wailing, some in wisedome, in knowledge, and morall vertues, but Christe in innoncencie, simplicitie, and cleannesse of hart, some in fortune, but Christ in mercie, some in glorie of warre and subduinge of countries, but Christe in peace: some in honour and pompe, but Christe in humilitie, callinge by nieke blessed, some in power and victorie, but Christe in persecution: some in ritches, but Christe in pouertie. Christe teacheth that perfect vertue is not gotten but by grace geuen from aboue, the Philosophers saie, that it is goten vp our owne strength and exercise: Christ teacheth that concupiscence is sinne, the Philosophers contrarywise recken it emonge the common thinges, which he thought neither vertues, nor vices, and that he doth goo forewarde in vertues whiche hath them reasonably well. Christe teacheth that wee should doo well to all men, and also to loue our enimies, to lende freely, and without rewarde, not to take reuengment of any, that we ougth to geue to euery one that asketh: contrarywise ye Philosophers saie, that we should geue to none but them onely, which doo require benefite for benefite, moreour it is lawfull to be angrie, to hate, to fighte, to make warre, and to practise vsurie. Furthermore they haue geuen vs the Pelagian Heretikes with their free will and with the instruction and natural light of righte reason. All morall Philosophie, as Lactantius saithe, is false, and vaine, not instructinge to the offices of iustice, neither confirminge the dutie and counsailes of man. Finally it is altogeather repugnant to Goddes lawe, and to Christe him selfe, that the glory thereof is due to none other, then to Sathan. is the Arte to gouerne the common wealth. There be three kindes thereof, that is to witte, Monarchia whiche is the rule of one, Aristocratia, whiche is of fewe, but noble, ricche, or els of the chiefest, Democratia, which is of the people, or populare. Nexte to these be the tirannies, Oligarchia, and Anarchia. But writers doo not yet agree whiche of these is to be preferred. For they whiche saie that Monarchia is beste, doo fortifie theire opinion with examples of nature, sayinge, that as vniuersally there is but one greate God, emonge the Starres one Sunne, emonge the Bees one Kinge, emonge flockes of sheepe one leader, emonge heardes of beastes one ruler, and the Cranes follow one: so in a comon wealth there ought to be but one Kinge as a heade from whiche the members maie not disagree. This before the other was allowed of Plato, Aristotle, Apollonius, to whome of our men Cyprian, and Hierome consente. But they whiche praise Aristocritia, saie that there is nothinge better to gouerne weightie matters, then the consultation of many and of the beste agreinge in one opinion. For of many good men, it muste needes be that the counsailes be good: & that none alone is wise enough, forsomuch as this alone belongeth to God. To this opinio Solon, Ligurgus, Demosthenes, Tullie, and well neare all the aunciente makers of lawes haue subscribed, & Moses also: to whome Plato and Citie semeth vnto him to be set in a verie good & most happie state, which is gouerned by wisemen: whereunto if you thinke beste, let vs ioigne the gouernaunce of noble men, for this opinion is established with the consente of many. But they whiche haue preferred the common wealth ruled by the people, haue called it with the goodliest name of all, Isonomia, that is to saie, equalitie of lawe. For there all thinges are put in common, and all counsailes be more certainely receaued of the multitude, wherein no doubt all thinges are founde. Finally it is wonte to be saide, the voices of the people is the voice of God, therfore it is necesarie that whatsoeuer pleaseth all men, & what so euer is ordained by the consente of the common people, is presumed to be a thinge very good and Iuste, as it were appointed of God him selfe. In briefe they saie that this gouernment is surer then that of the chiefest parsonages, because it is lesse subicite to sedition: for the people neuer or seldome are at discorde emonge themselues, but the nobles verye mutche, and verie often. Furthermore in the gouernemente of the people resteth all equalitie, and libertie oppressed by no mans tirannie, where degrees of honour be equall, and none is better then his neighbour, but euery one, and all the multitude by course dothe rule and is ruled. Othanes the Persian, Eufrates, and Dion of Syracusis did therefore commende this more then the other, and wee see at this daie that the Venetians and the Swissers with this Democratia florish before al the Soueraintees & Seigniories in Christendome, and haue the prise of victorie, and the praise of prouidence, of power, of ritchesse, and of Iustice. Yea and the Athenian common weale in times past rulinge very farre abroade, and mightely was gouerned by Democratia alone, and all thinges were handled by the people, and emonge the people. And in times paste the Romans hauing proued al the kindes of gouernment did gette the greatest parte of theire Empire vnder the popular Democratia, neither did they stande in worse estate, then vnder Kinges, and Nobles, but worste of all vnder Emperours, vnder whome all their power suffered shipwarke. It cannot therefore easily be iudged which of these three is the better, & moste profitable, sithe that euery one hath his maintainers and defenders. For Kinges to whome it is lawful to doo all thinges without punishment at theire pleasure, very seldome doo gouerne well and neuer rule without sturre of warres. Kinglinesse also hath this pestilent mischiefe in it, that they also, which in time paste were very good men, and allowed by al mens consent, assone as they had rule in hands as it were licence to offende, became presumptuouse and verie wicked, whiche was seene in Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Mithridates, and many other, and the holy Scripture also doo bewraie it in Saule, Dauid, and Salomon the chosen Kinge of God, and of all the Kinges of Iuda, a very fewe haue benne allowed, of the Kinges of Samaria, none. But they whiche now a daies he called Kinges, Emperours, and Princes suppose that they be borne and created not for the people, for the Citizens, for the common sorte, for iustice, but to defende and preserue the nobilitie: and doo rule in suche sorte that they seeme that he wealth of all the Citizens is not comitted to their custodie, but giuen them to spoile & sacke, takinge all thinges from all men, and vse their subiectes accordinge to their will and pleasure, and do abuse the authoritie geuen them from aboue towardes theire subiectes, charginge without ende and measure the Citizens with borowinge, the common people with subsidies, some with exactions & pillage, other with tributes one vpon an other. But if any more modest Princes doo release these thinges, yet they doo it not for the common profite, but for their owne commoditie, sufferinge their subiectes to prosper, that they also maie prosper, & maie haue what to robbe when they lifte. Yea moreouer to the ende they maie purchase the praise of iustice, thei ordaine straight lawes, but they attire Auarice and crueltie with iustice, they punishe offenders with terrible tormentes, with forfaiture of theire goodes and with many other vnreasonable and disordinate extremities, herein no better then tirauntes, because they couet to haue verie many offenders. For as the mischieuous deedes of offenders be the forces of tirauntes, so the multitude of transgressours is the ritches of Princes. I had in time paste in Italie verie familiar to conuersation with a mightie Prince, whome when on a time I exhorted to appease and mitigate the seditions of the Gibellins, and Guelsins in his dominion, he confessed to me that by the occasion of that broile and takinge of partes he had as good as twelue thousande Ducates in condemnations yearly brought into his treasure. But hereof we will speake more at large in the Booke of politicke nobilitie. But when the chiefest personages haue the rule of the common wealth, therein togeather with them dwelleth hatred, anger, and emulation, wherefore very seldome they raigne peaseably togeather, and whilest euery man woulde haue his opinion to be preferred, and be chiefest in authoritee, there are stired vp emonge them priuate hatredes, whereof oftentimes takinge of partes, seditions, slaughters, and ciuil warres doo arise to the destruction of the common wealthe. Infinite examples of this mischiefe be written in the Histories of the Greekes and Latines, and at this daie also many Cities of Italie doo shew themselues piteouse spectacles of them. But almost euery man iudgeth the gouernment of the people to be worste. Apollonius disswadeth Vaspasiane from this with many reasons: and Cicero saith, that in the common people there is no reason, no counsaile, no difference, nor diligence, and the Poete saith: 89 Th'vnsteadfast people seuered are in sundrie mindes. presumptuous, nor more foolishe then the multitude of the people: and it is the propertie of the common people to vnderstand nothing, but to renne headlong without aduise to doo theire businesse, like to a riuer that runneth with greate violence. Demosthenes also calleth the people a naughtie beaste, and Plato nameth it a beaste with many heades, whereof Horace maketh mention,  90 madde, slouthfull, very readie to chaunge opinion into whatsoeuer shall befall, distoyall, vnstedfaste, swifte, traiterous, ful of deceit, onely profitable in voice, ready, and prone to anger, and prayse: hereof it commeth that he, whiche in gouerninge the common wealth endeuoureth to please the people, perisheth with honeste reproche. But Licurgus the Lacedemonian beinge demaunded on a time why in his common wealth he had not ordained a populare state or gouernment, he aunswered him that asked, make first in the house a principalitee of the people. Aristotle also in his Ethickes thinketh that the gouernaunce of the people is worste, and of one, beste of all. For the common people is the head of errours, and mistresse of lewde customes, and a greate heape of mischiefes. They cannot be turned with reasons, with authorities, nor with perswations, because the one they vnderstande not, the other they refuse, to hire perswations they are dul and obstinate, whose manners be alwaies very vnconstant, desiringe new things, and hatinge them that are presente: neither can they be refrained by the learninge of wise menne, by the institution of Fathers, by the authoritee of Magistrates: nor by the Maiestie of Princes: emonge whome the counsailes of wise men were neuer harde without daunger, or in vaine: whilest the folie of the multitude doth well neare alwaies beare rule: as it is manifest in Socrates concerninge the opinion of the Goddes, to the Athenians, in the Troiane heade concerninge the bringinge in of the horse: in Magius Campanus, who counsailed that Hannibal should not be receaued into the Citie, in Paulus Emilius, who refused the fighte at Cannas, and finally in so many prophecies of Gods Prophetes not harde of the Iewes. Wherefore how can the statutes and ordinaunces of the people by good, if the multitude of the people be almoste continually ignoraunt of the beste thinges, seinge the greatest parte of them be handie craftes men, and partly also because they doo not consiste & stande in the ballance of equitee and iustice, but in number, wherein there are alwaies more ill then good: neither is it guided by the perfect iudgement of thinges, but by the opinion & number of the multitude: As Plinie the seconde saithe, the opinions be numbred, but they are not pondered. For in the consultation of ye people that is not of greater authoritie which the wisest men thinke beste, but that whiche contenteth the greatest number. Emonge whom, whereas all are accompted equall one to another, there is nothinge more vnequall, then this equalitee. Wherefore there is nothinge profitably ordained by the confused furie of the multitude, none of these thinges be better repaired whiche were brought to vtter ruine, and that is more the thinges which be very well apointed, be rather troubled, and taken awaie by the vnlawfull libertie of the common people. Emonge these so diuers gouernementes of common wealthes, many haue chosen a policie mingled with two sortes, as that whiche Solon ordained of the Nobles and the people, and after this manner he made all partakers of his honour. Many other also did institute a gouernment mixed of all, as that of the Lacedemonians was. For emong them the Kinge was perpetuall, but he did beare rule onely in time of warre, there was also a Senate made of the richest and the mightiest: they did like wise create out of the common people tenne perpetuall officers called Ephori, whiche had authoritie of life and deathe, representinge the state of the common people, Emonge the Romans in time paste Democratia was mingled with Aristocratia, for the authoritee of the Senate: For many thinges were in the peoples gouernment and some were ruled by the Senate. Nowe a daies in many places the Kinges and Princes rule at theire pleasure, yet they vse noble men, of prouinces, and Magistrates in theire counsailes, and exploitinge theire affaires. And hereof riseth a doubte, which comon wealth is salfer, whether that, wherein there is a naughty Prince, & good Counsailers, or where the Prince is good, and vertuous, and the Counsailers euill. Marius Maximus, Iulius Capitolinus, & many other choose the firste: vnto whome notwithstandinge many other substanciall authours doo not consente, for so muche as we see by very experience, that euill men be oftener corrected by a good prince, then an euill Prince is amended by good men. But finally no Philosophie, no Arte, no science is necessarie to the wel gouerning of the common weale, but the vertue of the rulers. For very well one, very wel a few, very wel the people dee gouerne, if they be vertuous: and moste naughtly, if they be wicked. But that whiche surpasseth al temeritie of naughtinesse, albeit many doo confesse that they are ignoraunt, or not able to husbande the grounde to fede a stocke, to rule a shippe, to gouerne a familie, to bringe vp childerne, notwithstandinge none is founde, that will saye that nature hathe not graunted him to knowe howe to beare office in citties, to take the personne of a Kinge and Prince vpon him: and whiche is hardest of all, to commaunde people, and nations. But touchinge that whiche in this place appertayneth to the knowledge of the ciuill Lawes, with whiche all common wealthes and cities be continued, ruled, augmented, and preserued, wee speake hereafter. To the preseruation of the publike weale also Religion belongeth, whiche is a certaine ordinaunce of ceremonies, and outwarde holy thinges by whiche wee bee admonished of the inwarde and spiritual things, as by certaine signes: Cicero defineth it to be a discipline, by the whiche the ceremonies of diuine honoure be exercised with reuerente seruice, whiche Cicero and Aristotle also haue witnessed to be very profitable and necessarye to cities: for thus he saithe in his Politickes. A Prince oughte more then other, to seeme a woorshipper of God. For the subiectes doo lesse thinke that they shal suffer any Iniuste thinge at such mennes handes, and doo Imagine lesse againste suche a one, as who woulde sare, he hathe also the Goddes in his defence. Religion is in suche sorte ingraffed in menne by nature, that by that more then by reason wee be discerned from other liuinge creatures. And that naturally Religion is founde in vs, Aristotle confesseth. further it is manifest by this, that as often as wee bee ouerwhelmed with any perturbation in sodayne daungers and fearers, immediatly before wee consider any thinge, and before all thinges, wee call vppon God, nature teaching vs without any master, to aske Goddes helpe, and euen from the beginning of the creation of the worlde, Caim, and Abel did religiously doo sacrifice vnto God: but Enoch was the first, that instituted after what sorte God shoulde be called vpon. Wherefore the Scripture speaketh of him. Then at length he beganne to call vpon the name of God. After Noes studde were giuen many lawes of Religions by many menne, to many nations. For it is reade that Mercurie of Iupiter, to them of Candie: Faunus, and before him Ianus to the Latines, Numa Pompilius to the Romans. Moses and Aron to the Hebrewes, Orpheus to the Greekes. It is founde writen that Cadmus Egenors sonne was the firste that gaue to the Greekes comminge from Phenicia the mysteries, and solennities of the Goddes, the dedication of Images, himnes, and other holy things, pompes, and assemblies, with the whiche they did honoure God. And whiche is more also they made diuine powers ouer robberies and mischeiuous deedes, neither only thei haue giuen names to the Goddes, but also haue ordayned Sacrifices. The Romans haue woorshipped Iupiter the adulterer, and rauisher, and in the palace they did dedicate a common temple to the Feuer, and exected an Aultare to euil Fortune in Exquilijs a mountaine in Rome. Furthermore they inuented Gods in hell, whiche they woorshipped, honouringe the Prince of hell Satane him selfe the vilest & most miserable of all other, vnder the names of Dis, Pluto, that is, the deuourer of fleashe, whiche alwayes goeth about seekinge whome he maie deuoure, sparinge no man, hurtinge all men, and accusinge all men. For this cause he was called the diaule, as whoe saithe an accusar. Wherefore the Poete saithe: The Prince of hell requierde the sinnes that men did here commit: VVho was deuoide of pitie, and no ghostes he did remit. The furies stande on euery side with diuers kindes of paines: And diuers tormentes vseth he, with rueful rotlinge chaines. In times paste the Egyptians woorshipped with theire Gods, brute beastes and monsters also, and there be yet at this daye of them which worship Idols, and Images. And the Turkes, the Sarasens, the Arabians, and the Moores and a greate parte of the worlde in these daies do woorship Mahumet the authour of a very foolish religion: and the Iewes hitherto continuinge in their vnfaithfulnes doo obstinatly looke for the comming of their Messias. And diuers of our Bishoppes at diuers times, and in diuers countries haue prescribdd manners of Religions to vs Christians. It is a marueile to see in how many lawes they disagree emong themselues about rites, about ceremonies, about woorshippinge, aboute meates, about fastinges, aboute apparayle, aboute lucree, aboute pompes, about miters, about purple, and other suche thinges. But one thinge there is that surmounteth the admiration of all maruailes, that they with these ambitious manners doo thinke themselues able to ascende into heauen, for the whiche in times past Lucifer sel from thence. And finally al these lawes of Religion are layde vpon no other foundation, then on the ordinaunces of sutche as instituted them:and moreouer they haue no other rule of certainty, but very incredulity. Consider how many opinions there be in Religion, and howe many there haue bene since the beginninge of the worlde, howe many ceremonies, howe many woorshippinges, howe many vsages, howe many Heresies, howe many ordinaunces, howe many vowes, how many Lawes, and yet the Religion of the Lord God which hath continued so many yeares past cannot bring men to the right faithe without the Woorde of God: who after he was incarnate, and triumphed ouer our enimies vpon the crosse, the Temples and Tools were throwen downe, the power of the heathen Goddes ceased and the oracles failed. The Oracle doth leaue to speake whiche none can nowe recal: Eor longe time since Apollo ceaste his aunsweares haue a fal. His gates are shut, he silence keepes wherefore forsake the coste: And Sacrifices duely donne retourne to thy owne oste. For after that the Woorde of God by the fidinges of the Gospel began to appeare to the worlde, al the Goddes of the gentils as it were blasted with lightninge fell to the grounde, as Christe saithe in Luke: I sawe Sathan fall from heauen euen as it had ben lightninge. But concerninge that, whiche heere appartayneth to faithe, to diuinitie, and to the decrees of the Canons, we will discusse hereafter: wee speake in this place of religion concerning these Artes whiche belonge to the gaine of Priestes, and to the beautifiyng of the common weale with their Images, Pictures, Temples, Churches, Chaples, Feastes, Pompes, and offices of Priesthoode, of which thing I did els where dispute at large emonge the Theologicke opinions declamed by me at Coleine very brief discourse, showinge also that in the thinges, whiche haue bene inuented for the settinge foorth of Religion, and for the saluation of men, there is founde muche naughtines ioygned with vanitee. Whiche thinge we will nowe declare to be true, ranginge thorow euery part and parcel. Al the people in times past did not allow the woorshippinge of Images. For the Iewes (as Iosephus, writeth) did abhorre nothing more then Images: neither did they make any Image of that whiche they woo: shipped, nor of the thinges, whose remembraunse they kepte. For the Lawe of God, by Moses did forbidde that Images shoulde be made, or put in temples, or to woorship them. Emonge the people Seres also (as Eusebius witnesseth) was a Lawe, whiche did forbidde, that they shoulde not woorshippe Images. Wee reade likewise in Clement, and Plutarch, that by the appointment of Numa 170. yeares after Rome was built, there was seene in the Temples of the Romans no Image, grauen, or painted. Augustine also witnesseth the same as Varro writeth, whose woordes, saithe he, doo moste manifestly affirme, that in Rome by the space of a hundreth and three seoare yeares there was no Image of the Goddes, and that afterwarde it came to passe, that thorowe the multitude of grauen and painted Images the honor of Religion was neglected, and had in contempte. The Perseans also, accordinge to the sayeinge of Herodotus, the Egyptians did exceede in these thinges, from thence deriued afterwarde into all nations, whiche corrupte custome, and false Religion of the gentils, when they began to be conuerted to the father of Christe, defiled also our Religion, and brought into our Church Images and 91 pictures, and many barraine ceremonies of glorius shewes, none of whiche thinges was emonge these first and true Christians. Here of wee began to carrie the dombe Images of our sainctes into the Churche, and with reverence to place them vpon the Aultars of God: and where wee accompted it for wickednesse that a man the true Image of God should ascende, there we set Images without vnderstandinge: to them wee encline our heade, them wee kisse, to them wee offer lightes, to them wee hange vp howsninges, to them wee assigne miracles, of them wee craue giftes, and finally to the wee goo in pilgrimage, to them wee make Howes, wee doo not onely reuerence, but woorship them. It cannot be sayde, howe greate superstition, I will not saye Idolatrie is maintayned in Images emonge the rude and ignoraunt people, whilest the Priestes doo wincke at these thinges whiche hereof receiue no small gayne. And in this matter they defende themselues with the woordes of Gregorie, who sayth: that Images are the bookes of the people, to the end that a remembraunce of thinges maye be retayned, and that they maye reade in them, whiche are vnlearned, and when they haue behelde them, that they maye be drawen to the inwarde beholdinge of God. But these are the manlike inuentions of Gregorie, excusinge them, albeit that holy man alloweth Images, he prayseth not the woorshippinge of them. For wee ought not to learne out of the forbidden booke of Images, but out of Goddes Booke, whiche is the Booke of the Scriptures. He then, that 92 desireth to know God, let him not seeke him emonge the Images of painters and grauers, but (as Iohn saith) let him search the Scriptures, which beare witnesse of him. They whiche cannot reade, let them hire the woordes of the Scripture. For theire faithe (as Paule saith) commeth by hearinge. And Christe in Iohn saithe, my sheepe heare my voyce. And moreouer also, if (as Christe saythe) none can come to him, excepte the Father drawe him, and none commeth to the Father, but thorowe Christe, why take wee awaye the glorie from God geuinge it to pictures and grauen Images, as if they coulde drawe vs to the contemplation, and beholdinge of God with the inwarde deuotion of the minde. Moreouer then that there is, and hath ben a wicked woorshipping of relickes. Wee haue no relickes surer and woorthier then the sacrament of the body of Christe, whiche alone beinge holieste of all is kepte in our Churches because we woorship and reuerence Christe presente who although he be presente euery where, yet there he is bodyly presente. But the greedy kinde of Priestes, insatiable men haue not onely made instrumentes of their rauine, of wodde and stoane, but also doo find out a cloke for their couetousnes of dead mennes boanes, of reliques of Martyrs, exectinge sepulcres of confessours, setting in shewe the reliques of Martyrs, sellinge theire touchinges, and kisses, they garnishe their Images, and with great pompe and solemne sights they obserue theire feastes, they preache them, and with greate prayses they extol them aboue the skies, but differ very farre from theire life, whome they doo so much commende. Dothe not our Sauioure speake to these menne: Wo be vnto you whiche builde the sepulcres of the Prophetes, and be like vnto them, whcih slewe them. Wherfore they accordinge to the custome of the Pagans doo distribute offices to the sainctes, and with Neptune thunder boltes, or with Vulcane to caste fiere: an other with Ceres to haue charge of the corne, an other with Bacchus to preserue the vines. Foolishe women haue also women sainces, of whiche they demaunde childerne as of Lucina or Venus, and whiche with Iuno doo appease or reuenge theire angrie husbandes. There he also of them whiche cause robberies to be discouerod, and thinges gonne or loste to be recouered, and there is no kinde or griefe, whiche hathe not his Phisition emonge the Sainctes, whiche is the cause Phisitions gayne lesse then Lawyers, for so muche as there is no controuersie so litle, nor so iuste, whiche hathe a Saindite to defende it. But as our soule doth declare by diuers members diuers actions, and they accordinge to the diuersitie of their dispositions receiue diuers powers, as the eyes, sighte, the eares, hearinge: so our Lorde Iesus Christe in his mistical "body, whereof he is the soule doth giue and distribute diuers giftes of his grace in these inferioure thinges by diuers of his Sainctes, as members meete for this, and euery saincte hathe his peculiare office of woorkinge, and euery one giueth certaine graces: according to the which manifolde distribution of graces, partly reueled to men, partly obteyned by godly coniectures, we craue helpe of the Sainctes with sundrie prayers and inuocations, for euen as Christe by his death hath redeemed our death, in whose deathe, holy deathes tooke theire beginninge, and the deathes of all the faithfull be sanctfied: so wee beleue that those Martyrs whiche died through a certaine kinde of infirmitie, or were put to deathe with suche a like torment haue power to deliuer vs from the same, as if they had suffered it for vs, and that truely hath a stronge reason. But wee maye wel laugh at them, whiche attribute these thinges to Sainctes for the similitude of names, for the confusion of voices, and for other suche weake inuentions: as the Germans, which ascribe the faling sicknesse to Valentine bicause that this name signifieth fallinge, and the Frenchemen attribute the sicke of the dropsie to Etroipus for the like sounde of the voyce. Yet in this place I will not derogate, or diminish any parte of the diuine power, nor the merites of the Sainctes, for he is wicked, who so euer thinketh amisse of Christian piety and of the miracles of Sainctes: but he is superstitious, and a ribaulde, whiche for miracls writeth an Historie of monstruous lies, and fabulous trifles, and make the simple people beleue them in steede of an Oracle, and repeate them often with greate clamours, they also are muche more foolishe, that geue credence to these fables & "dreames. And here I will aduertise you that as the superstuous worshipping of Images is idolatrie, so the obstinate detestinge of them is Heresie, for the whiche in time paste the Emperours Philippe and Leo the thirde were codemned. Also euen as the abuse of Reliques is an accursed deede, so the vnreuerence of the same is a detestable Heresie, whiche sometime brought vp by one Vigilantius a Frenche man, disanulled by Icrome, and now a fewe yeares paste hath begon a freshe to spring in Germanie togeather with the spoilers of Images. But now let vs speake of Churches. Wee know that this was in time paste a very greate superstition of the Gentils or Pagans, whiche dedicated Temples to euery one of their Goddes, whome the Christians followyng began after warde to dedicate Churches to their Sainctes. Notwithstandinge many Nations had no temples: and it is written that Xerxes did once burne all the temples, which were in al Greece by the perswations of the Magitiens, because it was a wicked and a cursed thinge to shut the Goddes within walles. Wherefore Zeno Citicus did Philosophically reason of Temples in this manner: it is not necessarie to builde temples, nor holy places, fr of righte nothinge is to be thought, nor accompted holy whiche men haue builded. Emonge the Perseans religiouse temple in al their countrie erected by Salomon in Ierusalem: whereof notwithstandinge it is reade in Isaie: The Lorde speaketh these wordes, the Heauen is my seate, and the Earth my foote stoole. What house is this, that thou doest erect vnto me. And Stephane the firste Martyr saithe: Salomon hathe builded him a house, but he that sitteth on highe dwelleth not in houses made with hande. And Paule the Apostle saithe to the Athenians, God dwelleth not in Temples made with hande, who beinge Lorde of Heauen & Earth is not worshipped with the handes of men, as if he had neede of any thinge. But he teacheth that mans nature, and men also being vndefiled, Godly, Holie, Realigiouse, and deuote, be very acceptable Temples to God, as he writinge to the Corinthians saithe: you be the temple of God, and the spirite of God dwelleth in you, & the temple of God is holy whiche you are. Furthermore Origenes writinge againste Celsus, dothe confesse that in the firste Religion from the beginnying of the Christian faith, and longe time after the passion of Christe, there were no temples builded for our sacrifices, shewinge with many reasons, that it is nothinge conuenient for Christians to the woorshippinge of God, and true Religion. And Lactantius saithe: Churches are not to be exected vnto God with stoanes heaped on highe: but euery one ought to keepe a place in his harte, whereunto he maie go, to worshippe God. God doth not dwell in Churches made with might of hande, A iuste man is the golden Churche where he dothe stande. the multitude, to the temple, to the Synagoges to praie, but vpon the Mountaine, and there he watched and prayed. Notwithstandinge the Churche, whiche doth nothinge, excepte it be moued with the Spirite of God, after that the Christian people was multiplied, and when sinners with the faithfull had already entred into the Churche, the feeble with the vnfeeble, and as it was in the Arke of Noe the vncleane with & cleane, it ordained certaine holy Churches, Temples, oratories, and hallowed places free from all worldelye businesse in whiche the woorde of God might be publickely preached to the Christian multitude, and the other Sacramentes of Religion more fitly and sincerely ministred: which holy places haue alwayes ben had in great reuerence of the Christian people, and fauoured by Princes with priuiledges, nowe they be growen to so greate a number hauinge so many Oratories of Freers ioigned to them, and priuate Chapels, that it shoulde be very necessarie to cut awaie many of them as superfluouse and aboundinge members. Moreouer then that, the sumptuousnesse of their buildinge is stately, whereupon very muche godly money and Almesse are consumed: with the which many poore Christians the true temples, and images of God, whiche die for hunger, for thirste, for heate, for colde, for labour, for seblenesse, for pouertee, ought to be sustained. Festiual daies also haue euer benne renowened aswel emong the Gentils, as emonge the Iewes: all which at sometimes of the yeare, in certaine and appointed daies did separately woorshippe God, as who saith that it were lawfull sometime to cease from the woorshipppinge of God, or peraduenture that God wilbe woorshipped more at one time, then at another: whiche thinge Paule this wise. You obserue monethes, times, and yeares, I feare me, leaste I haue laboured for you in vaine, and without cause. Whereof also he aduertisinge the Collossians commaunded them, sayinge: let no man iudge you concerninge meate, and drinke, in parte of the Festuall daie, or of the times of the newe Mone, or of the Sabbothes, whiche be shadowes of thinges to come. For emonge true and perfecte Christians there is no difference of daies, whiche alwaies keepe holy daie, alwaies reste in God, & without ceasinge obserue the true Sabbothe, as I saye hathe Prophesied to the Fathers of the Iewes, that it should come to passe, that theire Sabboth should be taken awaie, & that when the Sauiour shoulde come, then the Sabbothe should be perpetuall, and Neominies, (that is, the times of the newe Moone) perpetuall: but the holy Fathers haue ordained some of these daies, and some the Popes haue appointed for the ignoraunt people, and for the vnstable multitude, and for the vnperfectest parte of the Churche, There are therefore baies apointed in the Churche, in the whiche daies they assemble togeather to heare the holy preachinge of Gods woorde, to honour God, and to communicate the holy Sacramente: yet so, that the Churche maie not serue for daies apointed in the Churche, in which the people ought to cease from all worldly businesse, and bodily actes, to the ende they maie more freely serue God, geue themselues to prayer and contemplation, be presente at Gods diuine serutee, and preachinge of Gods woorde, and such other like thinges, which are then donne for the commoditee of euerlastinge Saluation. But that wrester of equitee, that breaker of order, and spoiler of beautie, and authour of all euils, I meane the Diuell, continually endeuouringe to ouerthrowe, whatsoeuer the holy Ghoste doth builde, hath euen almoste pulled downe this rocke. In suche sorte that the greatest parte of Christian people dothe not bestowe this holy vacation of Festiuall daies in praier, not in hyringe the woorde of God, nor in other thinges, for whiche they be ordained, but doth consume them in sundry corruptions of good manners, and Christian doctrine, in daunsinge, in comedies, in stage plaies, in singinge, in bankettinge, in sportinge, in solemne shewes, in fightes, and in suche like wordly and fleashly workes contrary to the Spirite, and holinesse: and as Tertullian saithe of the solemnitee of C aesar. They were then accustomed to execute a great office, to make fiers, and daunce openly, to eate in the streate, to perfame the citie in manner of a tauerne, to fil the throte with wine, to runne at tilte, to doo iniuries, to practise dishonestie, and the flickeringe enticementes of luste: and after this manner the open ioye is declared thorowe open shame. Are not we then woorthely to be blamed, whiche in this manner doo honour the name of Christ and his Sainctes. But we haue knowen no Heresies, or very fewe arise through holy daies, false onely the peeuishe blasphemie of the Manichees, and the pestilente opinions of the Cataphrigi, yet they gaue a verie great occasion of diuision in the Churche, when Victor the Romane Bishoppe had excommunicated well neare all the Churches of the Easte and the Southe for this onely cause, that in the keapinge of Easter daie they vsed a custome diuerse from the Romane vsage: againste whome at that time emonge other excellent men resisted Policrates hallowed Easter accordinge to the Romane vsage, yet he durst verie freely to reproue the Pope Victor, because contrarie to the examples of his predecessours being become a breaker of the peace had diuided the Churche not erringe in faithe, but onely disagreinge in some vsages from the Romane Church. There grewe afterward many things vpon this obseruation of Easter, decrees of Counsailes, and Bishoppes, and reasoninges of olde Fathers, and them which are called Ecclesiasticall accomptes: and yet vntill this daye they haue not benne able to appointe in all the worlde one true and certaine daie of Easter, and vntill this presente daye they dispute of the reformation of the Calendar taking counsayle of the Astrologers, but the matter is not yet decided: a woorthie thinge doubtlesse, for the whiche the Churche should sustaine so great a losse for the obstinate Religion of one Romishe Pope. Of the members of Religion, the pompes of rites, and Ceremonies be not the least, in apparrell, in vessels, in lightes, in belles, in organs, in singing, in encensinge, in sacrifices, in gestures, in pretiouse pictures, in choise of meates and fastinge, and such thinges obserued with greate admiration and veneration of the ignoraunt people: and of men whiche haue no respecte of any thinge, but of suche as they haue before theire eyes. Numa Pompilius was the firste that commaunded ceremonies to the Romans, that vnder theire pretence or colour he might allure men to deuotion, faithe, iustice, and religion, and more easily gouerne the rude and fierce people, whiche had vsurped the rule of the Realme with force and iniurie: hereof beare witnesse the shieldes called Ancylia, and the Image of Pallas holy pledges of the Empire, Ianus with twoo faces, arbitratour of warre & peace, the fire of the Goddesse Vesta, whereof a Prieste keeper of the Empyre did continually take care, the yeere diuided in xij. Monethes with the varietie of pleadable and vnpleadable dayes, the offices of priesthoode deuided into Bishoppes, Augures, and diuers manners of Sacrifices, of Prayers, Sightes, Processions, Temples and Offices: a greate parte of whiche as Eusebius testifieth passed afterwarde into our Religion also. Notwithstandinge God, who is not delighted with the fleashe, the bodie, & sensible signes, doth despise, and refuse these outwarde and carnall Ceremonies. For God will not be woorshipped in bodily actions, in sensible woorkes, and in carnall honour: but in spirite and truthe thorowe esus Christe. For he hath a regarde vnto faithe, he considereth the inwarde spirite, and the secretes of men, he is a searcher of hartes, that beholdeth the hidden partes of the minde. For the whiche cause these carnall and outwarde ceremonies cannot pricke men foreward to God, who accepteth nothing, but faith in Christe with zealous imitation of him in charitee, and sure hope of saluation & rewarde. This is the true woorshipping of God, & not defiled with any vncleannes of outward & carnal customes, the whiche Iohn teachyng saithe: that God is a spirite, and they that will woorshippe him, muste woorshippe him in Spirite and truthe. Some Pagane Philosophers also knewe this: for this cause Plato in the reuerence of the great God willeth that all outwarde ceremonies should be taken awaie: and Hermes to Esculapius saithe: This thinge is like to sacrilege, when thou praiest to God, to burne incense, and suche like thinges. For he wanteth nothinge, whiche is all thinges, and in him all thinges are, but we geuen thankes oughte to woorshippe him. These be the greate incenses of God, when menne geue thankes to him. Furthermore we haue nothinge, whiche we maie make more acceptable vnto God, then prayse, glorie, & thankes geuinge. Let none obiecte in this place the Sacrifices of Moses lawe, and the rites and ceremonies of the same, as who saith God were delited in them. He did not bringe them out of Egypte, to offer sacrifice vnto him, and burne incense, but hauinge forgotten the idolatrie of the Egiptians to hire the voice of the Lorde, and to obaye him in faithe and iustice for their saluation. But in that Moses ordained sacrifices and Ceremonies 95 for them, this he did to please their infirmitie and hardnesse of harte, pardoninge their errour, that he mighte withdrawe them from dishonest thinges, least that after the manner of the Gentiles they shoulde doo sacrifice to Deuils, and not to God. For the thinges were not principally graunted, but according to the consequence or sequell: and that lawe coulde not binde him otherwise, but as farre foorthe as it was allowed by the consente of the people. Yea & Moses when he was minded to giue these lawes of Ceremonies, he gotte the voices of the Elders, and the people, to the ende he mighte haue them more subiecte to him: & therefore that lawe mighte be chaunged accordinge to the chaunge of times and thinges, and in tome to come vtterly disanulled. But the lawe of God whiche was giuen in Tables of stoone, is perpetuall: for so saide the Lorde by the mouthe of Ieremie: to what ende Your burnte offeringes and Sacrifices doo not delite me: And againe by the same he saithe: these woordes saithe the Lorde: gather togeather your burnte offeringes, with your sacrifices, and eate fleshe, because I haue no thereof spoken to your Fathers, and in that daie wherein I broughte them out of Egipte, I did not commaunde concerninge burnte offeringes nor sacrifices, but I enioygned them these woordes, sayinge: Heare my voice, and I wilbe your God, and you shalbe my people: walke in all my waies, in all the thinges that I shall commaunde you, and it shall turne you to good: And againe faithe the Lorde by the mouthe of Isaie: thou haste not offered vnto mee the sheepe of thy burnte offeringe: nor hast thou made me lighte in thy sacrifices: thou haste nor serued me in thy sacrifices, nor haste endured any labour in the encense: neither hast thou bought me encense with monie, nor haue I desired the fatnesse of thy sacrifices, but with thy sinnes thou haste come in my presence. Upon whome therefore shall I looke (saithe he) but vpon a humble and quiete manne and that seareth my woordes. For the fatnesse, & the fleshe shal take thy sinnes from thee: they fasting which I haue chosen saith the Lord is this: vndoe the knotte of vnrighteousnesse, dissolue the bondes of violent bargeninge: suffer the traueilours to reste, & cut in peeces al vniuste writinge. Giue thy breade willingly to him whiche is hungrie: and receaue the straunger into thy house, which hath no lodging. If thou shalt see one naked, clothe him, and despise not them that be of thy bloude: then thy mourninges light shall breake out, & health shal soone grow vnto thee:iustice shall goo before thee, and the glorie of God shall compasse thee about. And when thou callest vpon mee, I will foorthwith aunsweare thee, beholde I am present. I denie not that which Moses and Aaron did in times past in the Sinagoge, and by succession other Bishoppes, Iudges and Prophetes, euen vntil the Scribes and Phariseis, and so afterwarde in the Churche that whiche was donne by the Apostles, Euangelistes, Bishoppes, Priestes, and Doctoures, that they mighte beautifie it as it were the spouse before the husbande with certaine Godly ceremonies, trim rites & instituitions. They whiche came after, haue ordained many Statutes and Decrees, accordinge to the imbecillitie of men. But that which is wonte to happen oftentimes, that that which hath bene prouided for a remedy tendeth to anoyaunce, so it doth befall that whilest these Lawes of ceremonies did encrease the Christians were at this daie burdened with more ordinaunces, then in time past the Iewes were, and that which is more to be lamented, when they are not good nor euil of themselues, the people doth more trust in them, & obserueth them more straightly, then the commaundementes giuen them from God, whilest our Bishoppes and Priestes Abhotes & Monckes make semblant as if they saw it not, which in the meane season do chiefly prouide for theire pauche. And albeit ceremonies 96 haue caused no Heresies contrary to the faith, yet they haue broughte in innumerable sectes into the Churche, and haue ben the seedes of the greatest schismes. For this cause the Greekishe Churche was firste seuered 97 fro our, bicause she did not cosecrate in vnleuened bread, but in leuened, whereas notwithstandinge wee confesse that shee dothe truely consecrate. Afterwarde also the Churche of the Bohemians reuolted, bicause shee did communicate the Euchariste vnder bothe kindes. But if, as the Apostle saithe, circumcision be nothinge, but the keepinge of Gods commaundementes: so the ceremonies also are nothing, but the obseruation of the precepts of the Churche. It is therefore ill donne euery where to parte the vnion of the Church, and to deuide the body of Christ for eury smal and slender cause, whiche nothing empaireth the Christian faith, and that for the whiche our Sauiour imbraidethteh Phariseis, to streigne a gnatte thorowe theire teeth and swallowe downe a Camel, & when the peace of the Churche is troubled to striue about them, whereby the anoye of schisme doth more endomage, then rebuke auaile. The Romaine Bishops might haue taken away many mischiefes, and haue keapt the Church quiet and sounde, if they had suffered the leuen of the Greekes & the Chalice of the Bohemians. Neither are these things of greater importaunce, then that, which Innocentius the eight, (as Volaterrane saithe) graunted to the Danes, that they might Sacrifice the Chalice without Wine. There are moreouer in the Churche Magistrates, & diuers sectes of men, partly for the beautifiynge of Religion (as they say) partly for keepinge an order in holy thinges, lest there growe a confusion. But what so euer is don in the Churche either for ornament, or for the edification of Religion, aswel in chusing Magistrates as in appointing ministers for ye church, except it be done by the instinct of the holy spirite, who is as it were the soule of the Churche: is vaine and wicked. For who soeuer shall not be called by the sprite of God to the greate office of God, and to the Apostolike dignitie as Aaron was, and he that shal not enter thorowe the gate whiche is Christe, but by some other place shall climbe into the Church thorowe the windowe, thorowe the fauoure of men, thorowe voices bought, thorow the rule of princes, veryly he is not the Uicar of Christe, and the Apostles but a thefe, and a robber, the vicar of Iudas Iscarioth and Simon the Samaritane. For this cause the aunciente fathers concerninge the election of prelates (whiche thinge the holy Dionysius calleth the Sacramente of naming or appointment) did so straightly ordayne, that the Bishops and Apostles, whiche did gouerne the ministeries in the Churche, should be named men most perfect in manners and life, able to render an accoumpte of euery thinge in sounde learning: but after that the auncient ordinaunces of fathers fell by little and little from their maiestie, and the late spronge Popishe Authoritie with damnable custome waxed stronge, many suche Bishoppes & Apostles haue climbed vp to the seate of Christ, like to the Scribes and Phariseis in time paste, whiche sate vpon Moses his chaire, whiche saie and doo not: laeing greeuous burdens vppon the shoulders of the people, and yet they will not wagge theire finger, they are hypocrites and doo al theire woorkes, that they maie be seene of men: shewinge theire religion in enterludes, they couet the chiefest places in ye quire, in the Sinagoge, in the Scholes, and euery where in the streete, they wilbe called Rabbi, Masters, and Doctours: they shut heauen gates, and not entring in themselues doo also keepe other oute: they eate vp Widowes houses, makinge longe praiers, goinge about the sea and the lande, they leade away and steale yonge childerne, to the ende that hauinge founde one proselite or one newe conuerted they may encrease theire wicked number, and that they past recouery and condemned to the fire of hell, may with their inuentions, and preceptes destroy others togeather with them, and corrupte the moste holy lawes of Christe: not esteeming the true temple of God, and the liuely Images of Christe and the Aultars of the peoples soules doo with a greedy eye regarde golde and offerings, doing very light thinges, and as it were contrary to the lawe, doo euery daie diligently inuente newe thinges of tenthes, of collections, of offeringes, and almessedeedes, & straightly doo ordaine the lawes of ceremonies, tithing corne, beastes, mony and the least thinges in valew also, mintes, anise seede, cumine, and for these in manner of dogges barkinge out of the pulpit do striue with the people. But doo vtterly neglect the weightiest and the beste woorkes of the Gospel, of the lawe, & of Christian righteousnesse, iudgemente, mercye, and faith, they streigne a gnat thorowe their teethe, & swallowe downe a Camell, they stomble at a strawe and leape ouer a blocke, blinde guides, false and deceitfull, the generation of Uipers, skowred cuppes, whited sepulcres outwardly shewinge holines in their Miters, in ther cappes, in their rachets, in theire apparayle, in their hodes: within they are full of filthines, of hypocrisie, of iniquitie, whoore hunters, dausers, stage players, baudes or whare marchautes, disers, glutons, drunkardes, poysoners, which (as Iohn Bishop of Camota doth wel note) haue climbed and ascended not by the vertue of theire merites, but either by filthy flattery, or by giftes, or by the fauour of Princes, or by force of armes to Priesthoodes, Benefices, and Bishoprickes, or vnder the colour of Hypocrisie haue gotten these dignities, heaping vp riches for their priuate vse, of ye goodes of the Churche, which belong to the poore, building faires and markets in the almesse of oure parentes consuming them afterwarde vpon hoores, in disinge, huntinge, in all luxuriousnes, and dishonestie. They doo delite in horse and hownde, and grasse of sunnie fielde. They make commotions emonge the people, they vexe kingdomes, they make warre, they pul down Churches, they builde Palaces: they goo in garmentes of purple and golde to the great hinderaunce of the common people, infamie of Religion and intolerable burden of the common wealthe: whiche Saincte Barnarde of Cleare vales in the oration that he made to the generall Councell at Rheins in the presence of the Bishop of Rome, defined not hired men in steede of shepherdes, not Wolfes in steede of hired men, but the Diuel in steede of Wolfes. And also the Romishe 98 greeuous and intollerable to all men, whose pompe and pride no tyraunt at any time hath surpassed: and not withstandinge these doo auaunte that the state of religion, and the Churche doth depende vpon the onely, when they casting vpon others the burdens of Religion, and the woorde of the Gospel, which is the proper dutie of Bishops, & busied in makinge particular lawes, doo take the profite of the Churche being at once both idle and wicked: and bicause (as they says) the pontificall seate dothe either receiue Sainctes, or make Sainctes, for this cause they beleeue that euery thinge is leefull to them: so that impudently and very wickedly they abuse the holy Scriptures with dishoneste pleasure accordinge as they liste: as wee reade an example in Crinitus of Pope Bonifacius the eighte of that name againste Cardinall Porchetus. This is that Bonifacius, termed the great, bicause 99 he made three greate and woorthy thinges, the first was, that hauinge deceiued Clemente, with a false oracle, persuaded him that he shoulde be Pope: the seconde, that he made the fixte booke of the Decretales, and affirmed the Pope to be lorde ouer all: the thirde, he ordayned the Iubilemus, the selling of Pardos, & was the first that streitched them out to Purgatorie. I let passe these other mosters of ye Romish Bishops, such as Pope Formosus was, and nine after him did very abhominablely gouerne the Churche: I speake not of these latter sorte, of Paulus, Sixtus, Alexander, Iulius, famous disquietours of Christendome. I ouerpasse Eugenius, who for his othe broke with 100 the Turke, set al Christedome in many most mortal battailes, as if promise shoulde not be kept with an enimie. Euery man knoweth with howe greate damage of the Christian comon wealth Alexander the sixt poysoned Zizimus Embassadours (as the Bishop of Camota saith, & is most manifest by cotinual proufe) do other while make suche spoyle in Prouinces, as if Satan were sente from the face of God to scourge the Church, they disquiet and turne the earthe vpset downe, that they maye seeme to haue that whiche they ought to heale, they be gladde, when mischiefes are don, reioycinge in wicked thinges. And scarsly can retaine theire teares: VVhen nothinge worthy is of teares. For they eate the sinnes of the people: they be attired, feede, and liue riotously by them. They haue very effectuall titles for theire vices, and nothinge can be obiected againste them, whiche they doo not very stedfastly excuse, and defende with the example of some Saincte. For if they be imbrayded for their ignoraunce, and lacke of learninge, they will saye: that Christe did chuse suche Apostles which were not masters of the law, nor scribes, nor at any tyme haunted Scholes, nor Sinagoges: if the barbarousnesse of speache be imputed to them: they will alleadge Moses, whiche stammered, and Ieremie, whiche coulde not speake: & Zacharie also because he was dombe, was not excluded from priesthoode: and also if they shalbe reproued of ignoraunce in the Scripture, and of infidelitie, or erroure, or heresie, they will saye: that Ambrose beinge not yet a Christian, but a gentill, was chosen Bishop: and that Paule not onely of an infidell, but also of a persecutour was called to be an Apostle, and that Augustine also was sometime a Manichie, and that the Martyr Marcelinus in his papacie did offerre incense to Idolles. And when they shalbe reproued for ambition, they will geue vs for example the sonnes of Zebede: if of fearefulnesse, fearefull were Thomas and Ionas, the one fearinge to go to the Niniuites, and the other to the Indians, if of disloyaltie, Peter harlot, and Samson also: if of strikinge: if of manslaughter, if of the Arte of warre, Peter cut of Malcus eare: Martine was souldiare vnder Iuliane, and Moses stew an Egyptian, and hid him in sande. In so much that it maketh no matter emong them, what manner of man he be that is made a Prieste, and then it behoueth that euery man put his necke vnder the sworde of these masters, I saye vnder the sworde, not vnder the sworde of the Worde of God, whose keepers and Ministers they ought to be, but vnder the sword of ambition, vnder the sworde of couetousnesse, vnder the sworde of condemnation, and extorcion, or rauine, vnder the sword of naughty example, vnder the sworde of bloude, & murder, wherewith they are armed against al truthe, iustice, and honestie. All kingdomes force decaies, if that respecte of honestie Begins to breake due customes, and doth cause truthe downe to lie: A freedome to offende there is whiche hated realmes maintaine, And measure of the sworde is gone whiche quite shoulde sinne with paine. It is not leefull without punishment to gainesaie theire decrees & ordinaunces, neither to withstande their carnal appetite, except a man be ready to suffer Martyrdome for Christe, this shalbe to be burned for an Hereticke, as it chaunced in time paste to Ierome Sauonarola a diuine of the preachinge order, and a man whiche had the spirite of 101 late time. But because all power is good, whiche commeth of God, from whome all thinges come, and all good thinges, and albeit sometime they are euill to them that vse and endure them, yet they are alwayes good to the whole worlde, he so prouidinge, which vseth well our euils. For God hath sente tyrauntes ouer vs for the multitude of offendours, and the sinnes of the people cause that an hipocrite hath the gouernemente. It is then a woorthy and a iuste thinge to obeye him, whiche hath benne appointed Bishop in the Church by God, and not to contrary suche a one in any thinge. For he that dispiseth to obey the Bishop and Gods minister, der he not contemne him, but God, as he speaketh of the dispisers of Samuell, sayeing, they haue not dispised thee, but me. And Moses saithe againste the murmuringe people, you haue not murmured againste vs, but againste the Lorde God. He shall not therefore remaine vnreuenged of the Lord, whiche hathe resisted againste Goddes minister and his Churche. Dathan and Abiron withstoode Moses, and the earthe swallowed them aliue. Many togeather with Chore conspired againste Aaron, and they were consumed with fiere. Achab and Iesabel persecuted the Prophetes, and the Dogges deuoured them. There wente foorthe children to skorne Eliseus, and Beares did rente them in peeces. Kinge Ozias presuminge to vsurpe the Priesthoode againste the Prieste, became a leaper. Saul because he presumed to doo Sacrifice contrary to ye wil of Samuell heade of the Priestes, was at one selfe time depriued by God from the royall vnction and from the sprit of prophecie, and geuen to the wicked sprite. It is a Pagans propertie not to beleue the holye Scripture, and a wicked thinge to dispise Goddes ministers. There are also in the Churche people of diuers sortes, Monkes, Freers, and Heremites, whiche were not in the olde Testament. The Churche also was without them at that time, wherein it was beste, and not entangled in so many rites of Ceremonies. The whiche at this daie doo onely chalenge to them selues the name of religiouse parsons professinge streight rules of liuinge, and moste holy offices, bearinge the names of laudable men and moste holy fathers, as of Basile, Barnarde, Augustine, Benedicte and Fraunces, and suche like, but nowe a daies there are fewe or none good emonge them: 102 but of the wicked the number is great. For hither they flocke as to a refuge of al wicked men, whom soeuer the conscience of mischieuous deedes dothe put in feare: whiche for the punishmente of the lawe were false in no other place, whiche haue committed offences woorthie of punishment whome dishonestie of life hath made infamouse: whom debte and shameful pouertie doo compell to begge, when they haue spente theire substaunce vppon hoores, in dicinge, and vpon the throte, and whom loyteringe, hope of idlenesse, and vnpatient desperation of deceiued luste, or youth put to wronge either by a wicked stepdame, or an vniuste gardian haue driuen hither: the rable of all whiche is lincked togeather with faigned holinesse, with a hooded habite, and with valiaunt beggerie, and with that greate sea, wherein togeather with other Fishes dwell Leuiathan and Behemoth, vnmeasurable Whales, beastes, and crepinge wormes, whose number is infinite: from whence leapte out so many Stoicall Apes, so many presumptuouse monie askers, so many cloked beggeries, so many hooded mosters, with beards, with coardes, with leather girdels, with sackes, with 103 corded shooes, with woodden shooes, with bare legges, attired in browne, in blacke, in graie, with the vppermoste vesture white, with diuers colours, with many skinnes, with garmentes of heampe, netted, cloked, girded, breached, and a greate companie of other suche players, who when they haue no hope remayninge touchinge worldly thinges, for the habite of theire monstrous apparaile diuine thinges are put into their handes, and at this daie in many countries they alone vsurpe the holy name of Religion, and doo beaste that they are the compagnions of Christe, and follow mates of the Apostles: whose life oftentimes is moste wicked full of couetousnes, of luxuriousnes, 104 of gluttonie, ambition, of vndiscreetnesse, of knauerie, and stored with all kinde of mischiefe, but alwaies vnpunished for the pretence of Religion. For they are defended with the priuiledges of ye Romish Churche, and are exempte from the iurisdiction of all Churches, to the ende they maie commit many knaueries and ribauldries without daunger, and albeit they can euery where cause others to come in iudgemente, yet they cannot be called sauinge either at Rome, or at Ierusale. If I should write the errours & vanitees of these men, all the skinnes of Madian woulde not suffice: of them I speake, whiche haue professed Religion not for godlinesse sake, but for loue of the bellie, haue put on a hoode. They are rauening Wolfes vnder lambes skinnes, and vnder the coates of sheepe doo in their hartes carrie the subtletie of the wolfe: and do in suche sorte dissemble the skilfulnes of their deceite, that they seeme to professe nothinge els, but a certaine comicall Hipocrisie, and a meere gaine masked in the image of holinesse, whilest with pale countenaunce, they counterfaite fastinge, and hauinge alwaies teares in a readinesse they drawe deepe sighes from the harte: and wagging their lippes doo faigne to saie prayers with an ordered pace, and caulme gestures: VVith bowed head do looke downe to the grounde. They chalenginge to them selues modestie, doo openly professe vnder their colourable habite, humilitee, and vnder the cowle hanged at their necke, holynesse: but within haue detestable manners: & albeit sometimes emonge these thinges they committe the horriblest sinnes that maie be, notwithstanding they are salfe, and doo remaine conquerours, resistinge all the sharpe dartes of fortune with the cowle as it were with a bucklar, & assured from all worldly daungers, and ciuill trouble doo eate idle breade, & begged in steede of that whiche is gotten with labours, sleepinge at ease and without pensiuenes, and yet they thinke that this is the Euangelike pouertie: to liue in idelnesse, and beggerie, by other mens labours. And where as they professe greate humilitee goinge in a vile habite, bare legged as ruscals, netted as plaiers, girded with coardes as theeues taken: with shauen heades as ideotes, in theire hoodes made with eares & beset with belles much like to fooles, and maskers on Shroftetuesdaie, and doo auaunte that they haue taken vpon them al other signes of infamie & vilenesse, for the loue of Christe and Religion, yet they are ouercome with ambition, and referre all the manner of their ordinaunce to very arrogant tifles, and glorie to be called Paranimphes, that is, mediatours in Mariage betwene man & wife, Rectours, Gardians, Presidentes, Priours, Ulcars, Prouincials, Abbotes, and Generals: that no kinde of men seemeth to be so desirouse of the chiefest place, as this. Moreouer then this, because emong the Egyptians the firste authours of Religion, there coulde no Priest be made, which had not bene firste instructed and trained in the Sacrifices of Priapus, and it is receaued in the Romishe Churche, that he whiche hath no stoones, cannot be Pope, and they whiche wante theire stoones, Eunuches, & gelded men are forbidde to be made Priestes: and commonly we see wheresoeuer these sumptuouse Churches and Colledges of Priestes and Monkes are, for the most parte there be at hande brothell houses: and also very many houses of Nunnes and Beguines be as it were priuate stewes of harlottes, whiche we know also that Monkes and religiouse persons (least their chastitee should be defamed) haue oftentimes maintained in monasteries vnder a Monkes hoode and mans apparaile. I thinke it not against order in this place to ioygne a discourse of the whoorishe Arte, the whiche many passinge wise men haue thought not onely profitable, but necessarie also for the gouernaunce of a well framed common Vealthe. For that Noble Solon, whiche made lawes to the Athenians, and iudged by the Oracle of Apollo one of the seuer, sages (as witnesse Philemon and Menander) prouided for yonge men boughten harlottes, & was the first that dedicated the temple of Venus Pandemus of the 105 imprisoninge of women whiche were in the stewes, he ordained brothel houses, he made a lawe, and established 106 it also with libertie geuen vnto common women. And whoores were had in so greate reuerence in Greece, that when Perses made warre againste the Greekes, the whoores of Corinth wente to praie in ye temple of Venus when they would make humble request to Venus for any thinge, that was comitted vnto whoores. There were very many temples for whoores builded in Ephesus: and an other famouse one did the Abidens erect, which by the meanes of a whoors recouered their loste libertie. Furthermore the wife Aristotle doubted not that whoores were woorthie of diuine honours, when he did sacrifice to Hermia his woma, as to Ceres of Eleusis. The inuention of this Arte is attributed vnto Venus, whiche therefore was reckened in the number of the Goddesses. For shee beinge vnchaste, and occupied in all Luxuriousnes, taught the women of Ciprus to please menne with their bodie for monie. Whereof grewe a custome in Ciprus as Iustine dothe recompte, that before the time of Mariage their maidens were set open to euery man that came by the sea side to gaine theire dowrie: and to paie 107 bawds also, as Herodotus testifieth, obserued a custome, that they, whiche had consumed their substraunce, should procure theire daughters to get monie with their bodie. And Aspasia Socrates his strumpette, as Atheneus writeth, filled all Greece with whoores: for whose loue, and her women seruauntes rauished by the Megarensians, as Aristophanes saithe, Pericles made the Peloponensian warre. The Emperour Heliogabalus did much comende this whoorishe Arte, who as Lampridius testifieth, ordained stewes in his house for his Friendes, Clientes, and Seruantes:and made them a very great bankette of xxij. sortes of meates: but vnder condition ye they which were bidden shoulde at euery dishe that came to the table vse the companie of women and washe: & they were bounde by an othe, that they shoulde accomplishe this pleasure: oftentimes also he redeemed whoores of all the bawdes that were, and did set them at libertie, emonge whome it is reade that he redeemed one very faire and beautifull whoore for xxx. pounde waight of siluer: it is also reported that on a daie he wente to al the Harlottes that were in the place called Circus, in the Theater them a Ducate. Sometimes also be assembled togeather in the common Palace al the whoores from the place called Circus, from the Theater and Amphitheater, from exercise, and from all places and baines, and there be made vnto them an Oration, as it were vnto Souldiars, callinge 108 them his fellowe Souldiars, and disputed of the kindes of figures and pleasures, and after the Oration, he caused three Ducates to be geuen to eache of them, as if they had bene Souldiars. And he did not onely graunte pardon, but libertie also to the Romane Matrones that woulde become whoores: and appointed salarie and wages for whoores out of the common treasure. Also he publisshed certaine amorouse and whoorishe decrees, and commaunded them to be called Semiramida after the name of his mother or wife: he inuented moreouer other kindes of sensualitee, in the which he surpassed the measures of one Cirena a very vnhonest woman (which being called Dodecamechana, which her friende might take greater pleasure, was surnamed the goulse of vnleeful luste) and did passe all the Auncient Tribadens, Hostiens, Aphiens, Spinctriens, Gasaluadens, Casaritens, and other women of dishonest places. I let passe Iuda the Isralite a Patriarke and a whoore hunter, and Sampson moste wise Kinge of the Iewes, who, as it is said, had flockes of queans almost innumerable: I speake not of C aesar the Dictatour a very woorthie man for this Babilomans, and of other most mightie defendours of queanes in number infinite: and the Emperour Proculus also gote no small glorie by this Arte, who (as his Epistle to Metianus doth testifie) of the hundreth Sarmatian maydens, whiche he tooke, did the firste night bereue x. of them virginietee, and defloured the residewe within xv.daies. But that is much more which the Poetes speake of Hercules, that he made fiftie maidens; women in one night. Theophrastus also a substantiall authour dothe recompte, that there is founde a certaine Hearbo in India of so great vertue, that one after he had eaten it, fulfilled Venus pleasure three scoare and ten times. Moreouer then this Sappho the poetresse ennamored with Phaon, and Leontinum Metrodus concubine very well learned in Philosophie, did not a little set foorthe this Arte: in so muche that shee wrote bookes againste Theophrastus, in the maintenaunce of whooredome against Mariage. Emonge these is Sempronia nubred passingly wel skilled in the Greeke and the Latine. 109 be ouerpassed in this place ea woman of moste constaunt faithe: who beinge tormented by tirauntes, to the ende shee might bewarie her frinde, with obstinate 110 seruante, and companion with Esope the fable teller in time paste made this Arte notable, whiche gote so muche ritches with her bodie, that shee builte a Piramis the thirde in order emonge ye marueilous fightes of the worlde. Thais of Corinth cometh nexte after this, who being famouse for the singularitee of beautie, vouchsaued not to receaue none but Kinges and Princes: But Messalina wife of the Emperoure Claudius chiefly honored this Arte, who visitinge the stewes, did exceede the noblest wenche of the companie in the daie, and nighte more then xxv. times, and so departed from the menne tyred, but not satisfited. To whome we maie adioygne of fresher memorie Ioane the renowmed Queene of Naples, and many other Queenes whiche were queanes, & courtly callets, if it were no daunger to name them, although they be very well knowen by common reporte, notwithstandinge in this pointe differinge from other whoores, that contrary to Heliogabalus lawe, not in comon strewes as that Empresse Messalina: but in chambers secretely do accomplishe theire desire, and as it were in a preuie place doo plaie the whoores. Wee maie also annexe to this place bothe the Iulias, the daughter and mee of Octauui Augustus, Populea, and Cleopatra Queene of Egypte, and other moste notable whoores: and recite also very auncient examples of the fleashly luste of Semiramis the Monarke, and Pasiphae: the firste of whiche burned in so greate desire: that not onely shee did solicite and procure 111 herowne Sonne to fulfill her inordinate luste: but also was enamored of a Horse, and vsed him in steede of a man: the other wife to Kinge Minos vnderlaide herselfe to a Bull. Wee will not here make a rehersall of famouse strumpetess but this is not to be concealed, that carnall copulation with whoores and adulterers hath engendred vs personages of greate bruite and renowne, as Hercules, Alexander, Ismael, Abimelech, Salomon, Constantine, Clodouee Kinge of Fraunce, and Theodoricke the Gothe, VVilliam gouerne at this daie, very fewe are borne of leeful Mothers, and the lawes of Matrimonie are so little esteemed emonge them, that they at theire pleasure doo deuorce, chaunge, & exchaunge theire maried, lawfull and very wiues: and semblablely they ioygne and reioygne theire Sonnes, and Daughters in so many Mariages and Matrimonies, that we are constrained not to knowe whiche is theire true and lawfull Matrimonie. There are many examples hereof, but some, which haue hapned a fewe yeares past, be sufficient Beatrice to wife, by whom he had the Kingdome of Hungarie, at length abandoninge her, toke in her place a Frenche concubine. Did not Charles the eighth, kinge of Fraunce forsakinge Margarite the daughter of Maximilian the Emperoure take awaie his wife by force, and ioygned her to him in Matrimonie? whiche woman after him Lewes the twelfte, forsakinge his wife in like manner, toke in mariage, the Bishoppes and Archebishoppes consentinge thereunto, and helpinge him, to whome it seemed good, that they shoulde more esteeme the lawes to winne Britaine, then the lawes to obserue lawfull matrimonie. And at this present I vnderstande, that a certaine kinge is perswaded I know not yet what he is, that it is leefull for him to dismisse his wife for more then xx.yeares, and marrie a concubine. But lette vs retourne to whoores and speake more of them, theire Artes whoso desireth to knowe, that is to witte, after what sorte they doo abandone their chastitiee to euery man that will companie with them, with what: wanton lookes, with what manner of countenaunce, with what gesture of bodie, with what sweete and flatteringe woordes, with what dishoneste handlinges, with what apparayle and outward polishinge they entice lasciuiouse persons, and other wiles & deceites of the whoorishe Arte, lures, snares, & craftes, let him seeke them in comicall Poetes. But he that desireth to knowe with what facion, with what delectation, with what earnest lookinge, with what talke, with what kisses, with what cullinges, with what kindnesse, with what touchinges, with what gentle pressinges, with what rubbinges, with waht wrestlinges, with what lyinge, with what wringing, with what mouinges, with what thrusting, with what entertayninge, with what prolongine of pleasure, with what turninge backe, with what renewinge the whoorish pastime should be accomplished, he shall finde it writen in bookes of Phisicke. Antiphanes, Aristophanes, Apollodorus, Calistratus haue moreouer writen bookes of whoores: but perticularly Cephalus the oratoure hathe writen the prayses of the harlotte Lais, and Alcidamus wrote in commendations of Nais a woman of the same profession. Of dishonest loues haue writen aswel Greekes as Latins. Callimachus, Philotes, Anacreontes, Orpheus, Alceon, Pindarus, Sappho, Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, Virgill, Iuuenall, Martiall, Cornelius Gallus, and many other, which haue not onely shewed themselues Poetes, but bawdes also: but Ouide in his heroicall Epistles and in his writings to Corinna: but especially in his bookes of the arte of loue: which more truly he should haue entituled of the art of whooredome, or be wdrie: for the publishinge of whiche bookes, bicause he had corrupted youth with his vnchaste instructions, he was woorthely bannished by Octauius Augustus as farre as Moscouie. Archilachus the Lacedemonian also caused in times paste all bookes of loue to be burned: and notwithstandinge this Arte is now a dayes reade of vs: and schole masters reade it to their schollers, and doo expound it writinge thereupon very wicked commentaries: but which is more, I haue newly seene and reade a booke writen in the Italian tongue, intituled La Cortigiana, and printed in Uenice, a Dialoge of the Arte of Whoores, most dishonest of all others in both Ueneries, most woorthy to be burned togeather with his authoure. I leaue here to speake, and that aduisedly of the abhominable techrie of the Sodomites: albeit the greate Aristotle dothe commede it: and the Emperour Nero did honour it with publike matrimonie, at that time, wherein Paule the Apostle writing to the Romans threatned for these things the displeasure of almighty God. For the Lord wil raine vpon them snares, that they maye not escape, fiere, sulphure, and the sprit of stormes shalbe part of their cuppe. The Emperoure commaundeth that the lawes shoulde arise, and iustice shoulde be armed againste those: and willeth that after straight punishement they shoulde be beheaded, but nowe adayes they are burned: which luxuriousnes Moses hath thought meete in his Lawes that it be rooted out with cruel punishmentes:and Plato forbiddeth it his common wealth, & codemneth it in his lawes. The auncient Romaines also (as Valerius and others testifie) did very seuerely punish it. Examples hereof were Quintus Flaminius, and that tribune which Celius shewe, but hauinge respect to honest eares, let vs leaue to speake of this monstruous lust, and beastly vncleanesse, and retourne to whoores. For this sensualitie is noysome to all men, and there is none whiche sometimes hath not felte the fiere thereof: but after one sorte the women be enflamed, after an other the men: after one sorte yonge men, after an other, old men: after one faction the comminalty, after an other, the nobles: after one manner the poore, after an other the riche, and that whiche is most to be wondred at, according to the variety of nations and contries, after one manner the Italians, after an other the Spaniardes, otherwise the Frenchemen, otherwise the Germans: the flaminge fiere of lawlesse lust in suche sort chusinge 112 diuers manners of madnesse according to the difference of euery king, age, dignitee, estate, and cuntrie: the loue of men is very seruente, but that of the women is very obstinate: the loue of yonge men is wanton, and of old men to be laughed at, the poore endeuoureth to please 113 with humble seruice, the rich with giftes, the comminaltie with bankettinge, the nobles & gentlemen with glorious sightes, and plaies. The witty Italian dissembling his loue assaileth the woma beloued with a certaine prepared wantonnesse, he prayseth her in written Uerses, and preferringe her before all other doth extoll her to the 114 heauens: if a ielouse man obtaine her, he shutteth her vp perpetually, and setteth watchmen to keepe her, as if shee were a prisoner: if he disapointed of his loue shalbe in despaire euer to winne her, geuinge himselfe to reprocheful language, doth detest her with infinite railinge & sclaunderous woordes. The vnaduised Spaniarde is vnpatient 115 in burning loue, verye madde, with troubled lasciuiousnes he renueth furiously, and with pitiefull complaintes bewayling his seruent desire, doth cal vpon his ladie and woorshippeth her, at length being waren ieolous doth either 116 kill her, or hurting her, maketh her common for euery man for meede:if be costrained to despaire to enioye her, he tormenteth him selfe exceedingly, and chooseth to dye. The lasciuoius Frencheman endeuoureth to serue, he seeketh to pleasure his woman with songes, and disportes, if he fal in ielousie, he sorowfully lamenteth: if he 117 be deceiued, he reuileth her: he threatneth reuengmente, and offereth violence: if he obtaine her, at length he dispiseth her, and falleth in loue with an other: The colde 118 Germane is enslamed by little & little: being enamored, he instauntly requireth wt Arte & enticeth her with gifts: being in ieolousie, he doth withdrawe his liberalitie: beinge depriued of his expectation, he esteemeth her not, hauing obtained her, his heat asswageth. The Frenchman 119 saigueth to loue, the Germane cloketh his loue, the Spaniarde peswadeth him selfe that he is loued: the Italiane cannot loue withyout icolousie. The Frencheman loueth 120 a pleasaunte wenche, although shee be fowle: the Spaniarde esteemeth a faire woman more then any other, although shee bee rude: the Italian had lieffer haue a woma that is seom what feareful: the German coueteth her that is somewhat hardie: the Frencheman thorowe obstinate loue becommeth of a wise man a foole: the German after 121 that he hath spent al his substaunce in loue, at length he is made wise, but too late. The Spaniarde for desire to please his beloued woman attempteth great enterprises: the Italian to obtayne his lady, putteth himselfe in very greate daungers. But which is more the greatest menne also snared in the passions of these loues, and lustes, not seldome do little esteeme and waigh many worthy enterprises, Capua, C aesar in Alexandria, Demetrius in Greece, Antonie in Egypt: Hercules ceassed in times past from his labour for Iole:Achilles Claudius died in prison for Virginias sake: Cesar was retained by Cleopatra, and the same woman was the destruction of Antonie. The holy Scriptures doo declare, that for the fornication of the sonnes of Seth with the daughters of Caine well neare all mankinde was destroyed by the floude: for the outragiousnes of fornication, Sichen, the house of Emor, and wel neare al the Tribe of Beniamine were broughte to ruine, howe often were the people of Israel striken, and brougth into bondage for the fornicatio of straunge women? And moreouer what great mortality was made by pestilence, famine, and the sworde for the onely adultery of King Dauid? For the laweles loue and rauishing of women, The Thebans, the Phocenses, and the Circeans were vanquished and conquered, and the Peloponensiane warre (as wee haue sayd) was enterprised by Pericles, and with x. yeares warre Troye was rased to the grounde, with a very great damage to al Greece and Asia: For the like causes, Tarquinius, Claudius, Dionysius, Hannibal, Ptolomee, Marcus Antonius, Theodorus, Gothus, Rodoricus, Longobardus, Childericus the Frenchman, Aduincelaus the Boemiane and Mansredus the Neapolitane, suffered death & a destruction fo their contrie. For the cause of Cana Iulia King Rodericus, after the Gothes were driue out, the Saracens possessed the whole country of Spaine. These wiues Clitemnestra, Olimpia, Laodicea, Beronica, Frigiobunda, & Blanch both Queenes of Fraunce, and Ioane of Neaples and many other being wroth for the fornication of their husbandes, slew them. The same cause procured Medea, Pogne, Ariadna, Althea, hatred cruelly to murder their own sonnes. And in these latter times, many other women haue reuenged the lecherous life of the husbandes vpon the childerne: and of most gentil mothers became most cruel Medeas, furious Althees, and vnmerciful Heristillees. But bicause thorowe the mocion, counsaile, & meanes of Ruffians, or Bawdes and bawdresses, whoores, and whoore hunters for the moste part doo commit theire mischeiuous deedes, let vs prosecute the Arte of Bawdrie. For as brothelrie is the Arte of abandoninge the proper chastitie to all men, so Bawdrie is the arte of assaultinge and makinge common an others chastitie: whiche is so muche greater then the woorthe Arte, as it is wickeder: so muche stronger, as the thinge is accompanied with the garde of many Artes: but so muche more pestilent as it comprehendeth many disciplines of other artes, and sciences, which creeping in like spiders, draweth out al Artes and disciplines, what venime so euer is in them, with whiche they weaue their weapons. Not suche as the cobbewebbes are, which letting birdes escape, take nothinge but flyes, nor also suche as these greate nettes of hunters be, whiche take the greate beastes and let escape the little and craftier vermine: but knitteth snares so stronge and so sure, that there is no mayde, nor wife, so simple or aduised, so constaunt or obstinate, so shame fast, or fearful, so great or little, which, if the once giue eare to the bawde, is not by and by taken, and entrapped. The subteltie is suche, which no womans wisdome can withstande, from whose snares no maiden, no matrone, no widowe, no not the blessed Nunne can escape harmelesse. Whose vnarmed fight vanquisheth the chastitie of manye more women, then anye armie at any time howe greate so euer it were. The falsetes, deceites, wilinesse, slinesse, and craftes thereof are suche, that no pen can write nor any witte is able to counteruaile. And albeit this Arte hath very many professours of bothe kindes, yet it hath made very few perfect masters: and no maruaile. For sithe that there are so many sortes of bawdries, as of artes and disciplines, therefore without the knowledge of al thinges it cannot be brought to 122 perfection. It behoueth then that a perfecte and absolute bawde and bawdresse be skilled in all thinges, and not to looke vpon one discipline alone, as vpo the North starre, but that he vnderstande all, whiche professeth that arte, whereupon all other disciplines do attende and wayte. For all sciences do as it were serue bawdrie. For first of 123 al Grammar, the discipline or science to write and speake geueth amorous letters: & teacheth them to speake with fayned salutations of loue, prayers, lamentations, and flatteringe woordes: many examples of whiche haue lefte vnto vs of the latter writers Eneas Syluius, Iames Caniceus, and many others. But there is an other kinde of Grammer, of the manner and waye to write secretly, as 124 whiche cunninge a fewe yeares paste Trithemius Abbot of Spanheim, manifolde writing, the 125 he hath taught so sure and secrete customes and manners to discouer the conceites of the minde, how farre so euer it be, whiche neither the ieolousie of Iuno, whiche knoweth al thinges, neither the straight keeping of Danaes maye resiste, nor the watchefulnes of Argus with his hundrethe eyes may espie. An Arte doubtlesse not so needfull for Kinges, as moste commodious for 126 bawdes and all louers. Nexte to this Poetrie commeth in place, which with wanton rithmes, fables, and pastorical songes of loue, Epigrams, letters, instructions, comedies, and dishonest verses, taken out of the moste secrete downe, and corrupteth the good disposition & manners of youth. Wherefore the Poetes haue alwayes bene the chiefest bawdes, of the whiche number emonge the auncientes they were beste learned, whiche we haue before recited in the whoorish Arte: Callimachus, Philetes, Anacreontes, Orpheus, Pindarus, Alceon, Sappho, Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, Virgil, Ouide Iuuenall, Martiall, And there are at this day Poetes, which write most pestilent verses. After these the Oratours clayme not the lowest place emonge bawdes, the Artificers of deceitfull 127 flatteries and persuations, and shee is the happiest bawdresse, to whome the Goddesse Persuation is fauourable. Yet the Historians stande aboue these, they especiallye, 128 Pelegrinus, Calisthus, & such like, in which maidens from tender yeares be instructed, and accustomed to fornication and adulteries. There is founde no stronger ingine to batter the honestie as well of wedded wiues, as the chastitie of vnmaried maydes and widowes, then the 129 reading of wanto histories:there is no woman of so good disposition, that herewith is not corrupted, and I woulde thinke it a miracle, if there be founde any, either woman or mayde, of so perfecte chastitie or honestie, whiche with such readings and histories of straunge lust, is not oftentimes enflamed euen vnto fury. And notwithstanding ye damsell, which in these bookes is very well learned, & can aptly tell euery one of them, & of their doctrine can trimly talke a long time with their suters, she onely is esteemed a good courtier. There haue bene many bawdy Historiographers, whose names are little knowne: many famous 130 writers beside haue endeuoured the same, as emonge the of latter time, Eneas Syluius, Dante, Petrarcha, Boccace, Pontane, Baptist of Campofregoso, and an other Baptiste of the Albertes a Florentine, Peter Hede also, & Peter Bembus, Iames Caniceus, & Iames Calandra hath wonne himselfe the price or palme of bawdes chieflye in those bookes, whiche he entituled Lecento Nouelle: whose examples, & doctrines, are nothinge els, but very subtill deceites of bawdries. Nowe when a shamefast, and feareful woman ful of honestie & religion shoulde be assaulted: howe great helpe do the subtilties of Logicke then giue to bawdries, the fable of Mirrha in Ouide doth manifestly declare. Emog the Mathematicall  131 Musicke is not ye lest seruaunt of bawdries, which inflaming feruent desire with the sweetnes of voyce, pestilent songes, and pleasaunt harmonie of instruments, dothe soften the minde making it effeminate, distaineth manners, and moste strongly, enkindleth the affections 132 and desire of fleshly lust. Nexte after this cometh in place the commoditie of daunsinge, where it is lawfull, for one to speake freely with his beloued, to touche, to kisse, to grope with vnchat handes, whom he lusteth, and oftentimes 133 wherwith to be occupied, who with a ladder made of roopes, or with some other climbing engine goeth in the night thorowe a gutter or windowe to companie with his Ladye, and with counterfeite key[illeg.]s & such like, as Dedalus aduontrous inclinations. In pictures also, women which cannot reade, do geather more by them, then other see in writing, whilest that in their chamber on euery side they beholde lasciuious and wanton things to prouoke them, and no lesse the mind is corrupted by the eies, then by the eares, for these do so much perce the minde as the other, & do no lesse allure men to fleshly luste with wanton images, then with the presence of thinges: hereof doth testifie Venus Gnidia, yt worke of Praxitiles defloured in yt teple, and Cupide Rhodes: and the image of fortune, a yonge man enflamed to lust, when he had seene a table, wherein was described, howe Iupiter descendinge in a golden shower defloured Danae: punishment 136 for painters, whiche set suche thinges before the eyes of the multitude, thorowe whiche carnall lust is set on fire. And not without deseruinge the wise man saithe, that the Artes of paintinge and engrauinge were inuented for the temptation of mens soules, to deceaue the ignorant, and to corrupte mans life. Nowe the Astrologers, the Palmesters, the Geomancers, the interpretours of 137 Dreames, the Fortune tellers the Soothesaiers, the Augures, and other sortes of diuinours come in place, all whiche doinge the duetie of bawdes, with theire craftie deuises, and deceites of subtill stinesse doo promisse vnhonest loues, and oftentimes purchase them, make moste wicked mariages, and more then often doo turne matrimonie into adulterie. Of these bawdes not onely women, but whiche is more shamefull, men also doo aske aduise touchinge theire loues and mariages: and conceiue an hope to obtaine the mayden whome they loue, and accordinge to theire counsaile, not so fonde as wicked, doo liucke or exempte them selues fro wedlocke. Many moreouer haue benne induced to so peeuishe incredulitee, that they beleue loue maie be caused & constrained by meanes of Astrologicall images, and obseruations of bowers: as Virgil, Catullus, Ouide, Horace, Lucane, and many other bablinge Poetes haue written: and the Astrologers them selues no lesse Fabulouse then Poetes, haue written rules in their bookes of Elections, with whiche one seruice of [illeg.] Astrologers & dia[illeg.]ours make no small thing: [illeg.] which Magick dothe pr[illeg.]se[illeg.] her solue as heal[illeg.] VVhich promisse doth do loose and binde the mindes of menne with charmes, VVhich shee doth please, and eke on some to sende full manie harmes. Lucane also speaketh hereof in this manner: Loue not by chaunce allotted vnto me hath perste my harte, By charmes of Thessall Dames whiche worke my woe, and cause my smarte. their louers, and in the Tragicall comedie of Callistus, Celestina the baudresse enflameth the maiden Melibea. To these are added witchecraftes, charmed drinkes, and amorous pocions, but verie perilous, that oftentimes in steede of loue, they bringe deathe, or some greuous sickenesse. Thorow the drinkinge of these died 138 Lucullus, and Lucretius also, but in space of time he loste his witte and vnderstandinge. It is writen of a certaine woman, whiche with an amorous drinke killed a man, whome the Areopagites pardones, because shee had committed it by reason of loue: but there is no Arte more 139 meete for bawdrie then Phisicke, which easely obtaineth carnal desire of what maide soeuer shee be, whilest that it promiseth to restore virginitee at the time of Mariage, to let the pappes fro growinge great, to keepe ye belly in one state, geuing remedies to cause barrainesse, wherby pleasure maie be taken falsly & for a longe season, Siue quassata spina conceptum semen eijcere docens , as Lucretius saithe: Idq sui causa consuerunt scorta mouere, Ne complerentur crebro, grauid aeq, iacerent. Et simul ipsa viris Venus vt concinnior esset. By the whiche onely benefite of Phisitions, many Matrones, Maidens, and courtly Dames, doo with salftie take delite:the starchinge of olde ruines, and other counterfeite colouringes of shameles women, which are writen & taught euery where in bookes of Phisicke, entreatinge of beautifiynge, wherewith they make the damnable marchaundise of Harlottes more saleable: and therefore the holy Scripture termeth them ointmentes of whoores, and with these many other receites, which prouoke to lawlesse luste, by the meanes of such like things, Ouide auaunted, that he tooke his pleasure nine times: and Theophrastus hath lefte writen that there is founde a certaine Hearbe, whiche extendeth the strength to the three score and tweluth carnall incounter. And to tell 140 the truthe there is no bawdrie more meete and conuenient, then that which is handled vnder the pretence or coloure of Phisicke, for there are no houses so close, no Monasteriese so stronge, no prisons so well kepte, whiche doo shut out the bawdie Phisition: by whome (as Plinie witnesseth) adulteries haue benne committed, yea in the houses of Princes, as of Eudemus with Liuia forbiddeth that none should thinke Philosophers vnprofitable for bawdrie, who beinge often conuersant with other suters in the house of Thais the famouse strumpet, 141 were at her commaundemente: and whilest other consumed their substaunce vppon her, he tooke his pleasure for nothinge. After this sorte the harlotte had that Philosopher for her bawde, by whose example and authoritee shee allured all younge men vnto her: neither was Aristippus content, to shewe him selfe a bawde to a whoore, but also began publikely to teache sensualitees, and transposed them out of the stewes into the schooles. Very many handicraftes moreouer supplie 142 the place of bawdrie, emonge whiche embroderie, spinninge, knittinge, sowinge, and other womanlike exercises he cheife, vnder the colour of which whilest that bawdresses carrie aboute flaxe, threede, headbandes, cawles, garters, girdles, purses, gloues, of younge whoores in allure softe maydens with these trifles, and take occasion to speake vnto them: to whome also laundresses be a helpe, which freely maie enter into the house, and in the absence of the mothers, carrie with them the doughters and the woman seruantes to washe: there be also beggar women, whiche stande at the gates for deuotion of Almesse, they bring and recarrie embassages and letters full of bawdrie. And carrie giftes vnto the wife whiche the aduoutrer sendes. 144 Moreouer also the valiaunt exercises of Noble men are meete for bawdrie, as runninge with horses, whiche be commonly called tournamentes, and warlike pastimes, by the policie of whiche Romulus in time paste carried awaie by force the Sabine women. Dhowe many times also hath huntinge accompanied the Adulteries of noble and mighty men in the preuie places of wooddes? This hath Virgil verie well writen in Eneas and Dido, when 145 occasion was taken of the absence of his companions fro the opportunitee of the chase. Iupiter also vsed shepherdes 146 for bawdes. The Citie of  Venice also doth testifie, what commoditee mariners bringe to bawdrie: and semblably delicate dishes of the kitchine, and sumptuouse bankets attende vpon bawdrie, as Virgill featly declareth in his Eneades: VVhen men from meate began to rest, and trenchers vp were take: Great bolles of wine alonge they sette, and crownes on them they make. Then did the Queene a goblet aske of golde beset with stone: And silde the same with wine and saide take in good parte; for none Vnwelcome is, then sipped thee a little of the drinke: And scarsly coulde the mouth, and cuppe, togeather iustly sincke. To Bicias shee it gaue, and saide, drinke of this cuppe of wine, He quickly quafte it, and lefte not of licour any Signe. Nexte other Lordes of Tire , and Troye , came fourth, and Dido spente The night in vaine discourse, and loue gaue her a curelesse dente. There are yet very many other practises of bawdrie, which I let passe:but Golde dothe excell them all wherewith if the Alchimistes (as they promisse) were able to supplie oure wante, they no doubte should be the woorthiest bawdes of all: for there is a moste puissaunt bawdrie in Golde and monie: For Ladie monie geues a wealthy wife, and noble birthe: Faithe, friendes, well feautred forme, ad aie enduringe worldly mirthe. With Golde is the ialouse husband pacified, with Golde the obstinate riuall is appeased, with Golde the watchefull keepers are ouercome, with Golde euery gate is opened, with Golde euery chamber is entred, with Golde barres, stoones, and the indissoluble bondes of matrimonie are broken in peeces. What marueile is it, that for monie Uirgins, Maidens, Wiues widowes, & Nunnes be solde, if for monie Christe him selfe were solde. Finally many thorowe this guide and capitaine of bawdrie haue from moste base estate, climbed in a manner to the highest degree of Nobilitee. This man hath made his wife the Kinges concubine, and hath benne one of his preuie counsaile, that man, his daughter, and hath benne created Earle:this man hath procured some Maried wife to fulfill the Princes desire, & woorthie of large stipende, foorthwith is become the Kinges Chamberlaine: some haue benne made woorshipfull for mariynge the Kinges Concubines, and haue bene made head rulers in publike offices, by the meanes of these Artes many haue gotten many fatte benefices of Cardinalles and Bishoppes, neither is there any waie more gainefull then this. But howe muche Religion auaileth bawdrie, the Historie of Paulina a moste chaste and honest matrone written by Aegesippus doth testifie, whom the Priestes of the Goddesse Isis confession can doo herein: I knowe many examples whiche hapned of late, if I woulde recite them. For Priestes, Monkes, Freers, Nunnes, & them whiche be called Sisters, haue a speciall prerogatiue of bawdrie, forasmuche as they vnder the pretence of Religion haue libertie to goo whether they please, & to speake with all parsons whosoeuer they be, howe longe and as often as they liste vnder a shewe of visitation, consolation, and confession, so deuoutly be their bawdries masked, and there are of them, whiche accompte it a greate offence to touche monie, yet the woordes of Paule moueth 148 them nothinge, who sayeth: It is good not to touche a woman, whiche they not seldome feele with vnchaste handes, and priuely goo to the stewes, and defloure vertuouse virgins, and widowes, and make theire hoastes Ceokoldes:sometimes also, whiche I may selfe know and haue seene, doo, (carrie theire wiues awaie) as Paris the Troiane did, & according to Platoes lawe doo make them common with theire companions, and Sacrifice to the Diuel the bodies of them, whose soules they should gaine to God: and committe many other thinges thorowe a furiouse luste much more abominable then these, whiche to vtter in woordes shoulde be a thinge vnsemely, in the meane season throughly satisfiying the vowe of chastitee, if with horrible woordes they reproue and blame in an other luste, luxuriousnesse, fornication, adulterie & inceste: & thei speaking of vertue leade a dishonest life. But often times most detestable bawdes and wicked bawdresses do lurke vnder those religiouse garmentes. The gentil women of the Courte, for the moste parte haue suche ministers to saie seruice, and vse theire aduise in Mariages and bawdries. The Lawes and Canons likewise goo  & 149 warrefare in the defence of bawdrie, when in favoure of great men they fight for vnrighteous Mariages, & vndoe the lawfull, and whereas they haue forbidden Priestes honest mariages, shamefully they are compeiled to keepe whoores: and the lawe makers woulde rather haue their Priestes keepe concubines with sclaunder, then wities with honest fame: peraduenture because they receaue greater profite by concubines:Wherof it is reade, that a Bishop made boste at a banket, that he had xj. thousande 150 concubinarie Priestes, whiche paide him yearly one Ducats a peece. There was in times paste, at Rome in the temple of Venus, a decree of the Senate engrauen in two tables, & the law of bawdrie, very fauourable to bawdes & lecherours, which we haue reade in Peter Crinite, writen in these woordes: In the firste table were contained, I doo perpetually allow men ennamored in the daie time 151 to behold, to followe, to whisper, to enter in, to reioice, to salute, to talke, & requeste:there shall no parson prohibite all these commodities from the house, hole, garden, posterne gate, & water fall:let them geue counsaile, kepe promisse, healpe and sauour all men: In the other table was written: In the night lette them feele the intentes of the parsons, let them intermedle othes with lamentations, lette them instantly allure, lette them set a parte al shame & feare, let them cloke theire sadnesse, let them doo as the time and place requireth, let not occasion be loste, let letters goe from one to an other: with these let them earnestly desire and craue hope, affection, expectation, necessitie & pitie, let them temperately vse guile, violence, deceite, and ostentation:let them haue, conceale, & shewe now wisedome, nowe foly: let them foreuer keepe some thinge of hers whome they loue as it were a sure signe, & testimonie of loue, let them goo vnto her thorow her sufferaunce, let them seeke a freshe woman, let them endeuour to winne a stately & noble dame by crafte or pope: lette them preuily renewe the accustomed coniectures. 152 Licurgus also made a lawe, if any aged man and vnmeete for the acte of Matrimonie, had taken to wife a younge girle of tender yeares, it laie in her power to chuse some able yonge ma to be get her with childe, so that the childe whiche was borne were affirmed to be the husbandes. Solon also made a lawe, whiche likewise allowed wiues, if their husbandes were not able to fulfill their desire, to pike out one of his kinsmen, of whom shee might receaue that shee lacked & looked for: that was not therefore reputed an other mans, whiche was borne. I speake not how many women there be and are knowen now a daies, yea of the noblest, which yearely being great with childe thorowe foraine seede, doo make their husbandes beleue that the children which be borne are theirs. And againe after childbirth they haue recourse euery other daie to satisfie the Adulterers: warse then Iulia the wife of Marcus Agrippa, which tooke no Mariner but when the shippe was fraighte. The holy bookes of the Bible also (if it be lawful to speake it) haue subtelties of bawdrie, as it is clearely seene in the wiues mother of Ruth, and in Ionadab, called in the Scripture a wise man, & in Achitophell a mighty counsailour. Abraham also whereas he had Sara to wife a faire and younge woman, & were emonge the Egyptians, he saide to her: I know thaqt thou arte a faire woman, & when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will saie: shee is his wife: & they will kill me: & they will keepe thee emonge them. Saie therfore I besech thee, that thou art my sister, to the ende that I maie be in falstie for thy sake, & for the loue of thee my soule shall liue, ad so at the length Sara was taken in Pharos house, and for consideration of her Abraham was wel vsed. Thesame crafte vsed Abimelech with the Kinge of the Palestines, geuing his wife licence to lie with twoo Kinges but at diuerse times. Thesame did Isaac the sonne of Abraham: & so likewise the Arte of bawdrie hath ben set foorth with the exaples of Sainctes. Furthermore it hath benne reuerenced and honoured of the Goddes, of noble personages, of lawe makers, of philosophers, of passinge wise men, of diuines, of Princes, and of the veray heades of religion. The God Pan, Mercurie, & boie Cupide were bawdes, the Baron Vlysses was a bawde, Licurgus houses, and prouided whoores for yonge men. And in our time the Pope 153 Sixtus erected in Rome a notable stewes, the Emperoure Heliogabalus was a bawde, who mainteined in his house celles of whoores, and exhibited them to his friendes and seruauntes. Ouer and bedies this Queenes, Princesses, and Ladies be careful of this, and kinges mothers are other whiles bawdresses to theire sonnes. Moreouer the chiefe rulers and officers do not disdaigne this office, for in time part the Corinthians, the Ephesians, ye Abidens, their Cities doo builde and maintaine brothels houses, whoordinge vp no small profite in theire treasure of the gaine of harlottes: whiche is not seldome vsed in Italie, where the whoores in Rome paye weekely to the 154 thousande Ducates, and more, and this office doth so much belong to the Prealts of the Church, that togeather with the reuenewes of theire benefices they accompte also the tribute of bawdrie. For I haue harde them sometimes make accompt in this manner, sayinge, he hath twoo benefices, one cure of rr. ducates, an other Priorie of xl. ducates, & three whoores in the stewes, whiche pay him euery weeker xx Guilies. Neuertheles the Bishoppes and officials are bawdes also, whiche do compell the Priestes to pay them yearely a reuenew for their concubines, and this they do so openlye, that this theire marchaundise of women, or bawdrie is growen to a prouerbe emonge the people, whiche saye: whether he haue or not, he shal pay a ducate for a concubine, & let him haue her if he will. But in the kingdom of auarice, nothinge is attributed to dishonestie, whereof gaine may arise: I wil not speake of the inuention of sufferaunce, by the which, payinge a certaine summe of mony to the Bishoppes, the wife in absence of her husbande, without offence of adultery (as they say) is licenced to dwel with an other:which thinges be so cleare and manifeste, that we are enforced to be ignorant, whether is more foolish, the impudency of the Bishoppes, or the pacience of the people: that at the length, the Princes of Germanie, haue bene enforced to recken these emonge other greeuous burdens of that nation, by whiche you maye very well perceiue the residue, which are here passed ouer with silence. Such defendours then hath the Arte of bawdrie, and whiche do maintayne the whoorishe science, that vntil this day (the more pity) it is allowed in the Christian common weale, and there are graunted them in Cities publicke Theaters, priuiledges, and wages, whileste this onely weake reason of man, or rather bawdye inuention, striueth againste the lawes of God and his woorde, in which they say, that this is maintained, 155 to the ende that youth hauinge there auoyded the furie of fleshly lust, may forbeare to attept warse things, they say, take whoores out of the common wealth, euery place would be stuared with fornication, incest, & adulteries, no maried woman shall remaine chaste: no widowe shalbe of perfect honestie: maydens shalbe scarsly kepte in salftie: in fine, for this cause that coclude, that it is impossible 156 for the common weale to be in quietenesse without whoores, without whiche notwithstanding the people of Israel in time past did moste constauntly continue many hundreth yeares, as Godremmaunded them, Let there vncleannesse in time past crepte into the Churche vnder the whewe of Religion, and did spreade abrode the hereste of the Nicolaites, which to auoide gelosie made their wiues common, and taught in a maner after 157 Platose lawe, that they ought to be common. But al such Princes, Iudges, and Magistrates, as doo maintaine brothels houses, or in any wise do allow them, although they paly not the lecherours, ye Lord wil say vnto them, as the Psalmist saith:if thou sawest a theefe, thou wentest with him, and haddest thy part with adulterers: thou hast don these thinges, and I haue helde my peace: thou hast beleued a wicked man, that I am like vnto thee, but I will accuse thee, and will make thee come before my face. poore, and the sicke:to the ende that none thorowe pouertie may offende,  & steale, or going about begginge infecte the Citie with  158 pestilence, or perishe for hunger, to the reproche of humanitie. For the whiche cause Hospitalles of poore people haue benne ordayned in many places with publike gatheringes of monie, & great deuotion, and dayly enriched with the priuate almesse of wealthy men. For it hath bene alwayes forbidden euen fro the beginninge, and by the lawes of al nations, to begge openly, and go from citie to citie: For in the olde lawe Moses commaunded the Iewes, that there shoulde not be emonge them any poore man or Begger. In the Roman lawes also Iustinian the Emperoure made a streict ordinance touching valiant beggers, ye if any able to labour were foud to aske almesse, he should be taken, and brought into bodage. Christ in the law of the Gospel commaudeth, that that, whiche remaineth shoulde be giuen to the poore, to the end that there remaine no begger, nor poore parson emong the people: but that there be an equalitie, as Paule writeth to the Corinthians sayinge: Let your plenty supply theire wante to the ende that theire plentye may supply your pouerty, and let their be an equality, as it is writen. He that hath muche dothe not abounde, and he that hath little, lacketh nothinge: and writinge to the Ephesians, saithe: Let him that firste robbed, now robbe nomore, but rather let him woorke that whiche is good in labouringe with his handes, that he may haue wherewith to helpe the needy. The same also commaudeth the Thessalonians to labour with their handes, & to endeuoure to haue abundaunce, appointing them as it were a decree, that he which would not laboure, should not eate:and commaunded, that they which did other wise, shoulde be taken from emonge the felowshippe of the faithfull, and in the Epistle to Timothee he condemneth them, which thinke the gaine of begginge, a woorke of godlinesse, The Canon Decrees of the Popes also haue ordayned, that almesse should be distributed on those poore people onely, whiche cannot labour, and doo recken all other, whiche take almesse, emonge theues, robbers, and sacrilegers. By these authours then we are taught, that we ought not to haue so greate compassion of pouertie as to deteste and blame beggerie. And the artes, which they haue deuised to gaine by begginge, are to be hated of all men, whilest that they had liesser at the Church doore, to the iniure of mans nature, & against the lawes of God, willingly to suffer deadly colde, gnashinge of teethe, skorchinge heate, and cruell tormentes, that vneth they can auoyde deathe it selfe, then to liue content with almesse in the hospitals of poore people, and cure theire griefes. And that which is more to be detested, beinge in thse greeuous tormentes, they curse, rayle, vtter spiteful woordes, they are dronken, & forsweare themselues, and otherwhiles praying counterfaitly, settinge at naught, and dispisinge al godly thinges, doo not woorship Christe with any reuerence:so that they seeme to the beholders not Martyrs of Christ, but damned soules and 159 spirites of hell. There is another moste wicked kinde of beggers not to be pitied, that is to witte of them, whiche with birdlime, meale, bfoude, and corrupte matter, with crusted woundes, and counterfaite blisters doo peinte themselues full of soars and cankers, diuers saigninge diuers infirmities, with sundrie sleightes do shew themselues miserable to the beholders. Some other there are, whiche vnder the prentence of vowes, and pilgrimages, 160 walke about the countrie, eschewing laboure of purpose, thorowe idle pouertie begginge for Gods sake from doore to doore, and these in the meane season will not chaunge theire life with kinges, so that they maye freely wander where they please, and doo what euer they thinke good in warre and peace, In al places thei be safe from exactions, from publike subsides, from bondage, and from al partes and euery where they are free from ciuill correction, they be not apprehended for theire fraude, deceite, trumpery, theste, and iniuries, and as men consecrated to God doo passe without receiuinge hurte of any man:and notwithstandinge there ariseth of theire order no small inconuenience, and horrible ribaldries doo from thence proceede, whileste vnder pretence of beggerie they searche out the secrets of cities, and countries:and whilest thei practised in deceite and craft, and instructed to al kindes of reason do carrie and recarrie the letters of the enimie. By them sometimes Cities haue ben burned, which Fraunce, and the Citie of Trire haue of late yeares experienced, sometimes they haue poysoned the water, infected the corne, and venomed the victuals, and the pestilence beinge dispersed, haue made a greate mortalitie of men. With these 161 VVhiche do delite to liue by forayne spoile It paineful is for them to dwell at home And they abhorre to knowe theire natiue soile. These beinge borne in the countrie which lieth betweene Egypt and Ethiopia, and by auncetours descending fro ye generation of Chus the sonne of Cham, the sonen of No e, do euen vnto this day suffer ye curse of their grandfather, and wanderinge throughout all the worlde, plantige tentes without citties the in fieldes, and crosse waies, do get theire liuinge with these deceites, to wit, with stealing, and robbing, with falsehed and bartring, and delite men also with palmestrie, foreshewing thinges to come. Volaterranus Scilares, who wrote the Historie of Constantinople. He saithe that Michaell Traulus the Emperour attayned his Empire by the prophecye of the Vxij, which secte skattered thorowe Mesia and Europe, did generally foretell al men thinges to come. Polydorus affirmeth, that thei be Assyrians and Cilicians. But nowe this plague of valiaunt beggerie doth not onely herbe roughe emonge tmeporall man, and the vilest knaues of lewdest demeanoure, but also it is crepte into religion, emonge 162 the order of Monkes and Priestes. From hence arose these sectes of Freers, Monkes, and other wandringe prowlers, in the number of whiche be then, that vnder false shewe of religion, carrying about, (as they say) reliques of Sainctes, or els vnder false hypocrisie, she winge outwarde holinesse, with many inuentions of fained miracles, threatning the wrath of the Sainctes, promising pardons, and dispensations vnder the pretence of alinesse doo prole for profite: & going about the countrie doo gaiue of the ignorante country men, and of the light beleuinge women, being superstitiously astonied, a sheepe, a lambe, a kidde, a calfe, a pigge, gamondes of bacon, wine, oyle, butter, corne, beanes & pease, milke, cheese, egges, hennes, woll, hempe, and gettinge monye of them robbe all the world, & in this wise loden with fat spoiles they returne home, where with great ioy their fraternitte doth receiue them, & commed them bicause they haue so religiously begiled the simple people, and sely women, and deema with like craftes of beggerie, and notable subtilties of deceits to offer very acceptable sacrifices to God, as oftentimes as after this manner they charged with booty, with great hinderaunce of the people, & detrimente to the common wealth, do franke and fatten the idle officers of their familie, nothinge at al esteeming, neglecting, and dispising the workes of mercy, vnder the collour of which so many giftes are bestowed on them. Apuleius in his Asie did in time past write the fable of them, speaking of the priestes of the Goddesse Syria. There are beside these innumerable sectes of begginge Freers, & (as they say) of Beguardes, whiche laying aside, the holines of theire profession, haue chaunged godlinese for gaine, as if they did to no other ende professe religion, then that vnder the title of pouertie they maye range where euer they please and with a shameles face and importunate hipocrisie to scrape mony togeather on euery side not to be ashamed of any dishonest gaine, and with marueilous railinges to brawle at the people in the Quire, in the streate, in the Churche, in the schooles, in courtes, in palaces, in publike & priuate communication, in confessions, in disputations, in sermons, from benches, from chears, out of pulpits, and preaching places, fortresses of their impudecte, to sel the marchaundise of pardons, to measure theire good deedes with ceremonies, & to wring from marchauntes, vsurers, and notable theues the pray of misgotten goodes, and to beguile rude citisens, ignoraunte people, & superstitious dotinge women of their mony, and by the example of the Serpet first to allure foolish women, & by meanes of them to finde a way to deceiue men, which whilest they shewe pouerty with a counterfait basenesse of apparaile & cryinge lowde doo preach that mony should not be esteemed, & that ambitio should be eschued, they care for nothing more then to possesse infinite riches: and for this cause they go about ye sea and lande, they enter into al mens houses & shoppes, & do not minister their Sacraments but for mony, they tiranously demaund almesse as it were tribute, they medle with all mens marters, they make vnlawfull mariages, they turne testamentes vpside downe, they set men at one that be variauce, they reforme nunes, but they do al these thinges for their commoditie: these be the freer like artes, with which many of them haue growen so greate authoritie, that they make the Emperours and Popes afraide, and haue heaped vp more riches then the wealth of marchaunts & treasures of Princes, & with many thousandes 163 of powndes haue bought miters, & Chaplets, and with great summes of mony haue aspired also to ye Popedome. So great power hath that religious beggerie. And albeit they possesse great masses of mony, notwithstanding many of them make a shew of extreame pouertie, & of perfection more then euangelike, in case they touche not this with their bare fingers, but haue a Iudas to carrie theire purses, & giue them an accompt, in the meene while they presume to say, as Peter & Iohn did, we haue no golde and siluer with vs. But if herein they did not lye, and theire talke were faithful, thei should haue power to say arise, & walke. And togeather with their holy father S. Fraunces cleane without mony, & vices, did commaunde creatures, & obeied the, turned water into wine, passed ouer riuers drie shoed, made wilde wolfes tame, staied the chirpinge of swallowes with commaundeniet alone, made a falcon crowe like a Cocke, commaunded the fire, and did many suche faigned miracles, whiche be falsly affirmed of their Saincts Fraunces. Richarde Bishoppe of Armachane, and Malleolus prouoste of Tigure, and Iohn Bishoppe of Camota, haue in time paste written againste these cursirours, & many other haue made mention of them, whiche did plainely detecte the abuse of this religiouse beggerie. But now let these suffice, to the ende that we maie proceade farther. houshold in generall. Cap. 66. whiche is a certaine domesticall common weale, and nothinge els but a certaine priuate Monarchie, but there are many kindes thereof. For one is called kingly, or courtly:an other Satrapicll, or warre like: againe an other comon, or belonginge to the comunaltie, or els Conentual, or belouging to companie, and finally one priuate or monasticke. This dothe then teache in what manner the wife, the children, the kinsfolke, the familie, and the seruauntes are to be gouerned, by what meanes the house and possession is to be preserued and augmented, and whereof expences are to be leuied. Moreouer al the subtiltees which be in rents, in monie, in tallages, in tributes, in tenthes, in vsuries, in aduauntages, or ouerplusses, and in traficke, and all the newe craftes, and inuentions, to finde profit and aduantage. Furthermore of felowshipees also, of agreementes, of controuersies, and warre, all whiche thinges because they haue neither measure, nor rule, are called Anomals. nor Science, but a certaine domesticke or priuate discipline compacted and made of the opinion, vse, custome, yrudencie, or rather of the subtiltie of men, whereunto are referred all woorkes that be done sittinge, and handicraftes, whiche consiste in stare, woulle, woodde, yron, brasse, and diuerse mettals: seruill obeysaunces also of barbars, bainekepers, hucksters, and diuerse waies to get liuinge & increase substance:whiche appertaine not to the authoritee of gouernmente, and auaile no deale to the rule of the publike wealth, foreeastinge and consideringe no diuine, comely, nor woorthe matter, which are so many, that thei cannot be numbred, and al these are seruill:many other also be infamouse for the affinitie whiche they haue with vices, as Carters, Mariners, and Inholders, be reputed in famouse for the 164 vice of vnmeasurable talkinge, because they delite in fables and spreade newes, and likewise barbars, Bainekepers, and Shepherdes. For the fable of Midas, and the historie of Sylla beseginge Athens haue made these infamouse, and the fable of Battus the other. Semblablye Singers, Pipers, Harpers, men hyred for monie, be infamouse, whiche at bankettes sounde instrumentes of Musicke to delite others, but the Mariners life, as it is the vnhappiest of al, so is it the warste, whose dwellinge place is like a prison, their fare exceadinge harde, and the same very filthie, their apparaile bile, & summarily they haue an incommoditee of all thinges, perpetuall exile, alwaies wandringe, neuer abidinge in one place, & knowe not reste, euer tossed with the raginge windes, and with not reste, euer tossed with the raginge windes, and with the waueringe surges, alwaies subiecte to heate, colde, raine, lightning, hunger, thirste, and vncleannesse. The Sylles, the Charibdes, the Sirtes, the Symplegades, and so many daungerouse leopardies of the Sea come nexte vnto these: beside this the tempeastes of the Sea, thev the whiche there is nothinge more fearefull, and horrible, and with al these and many other mischiefes a continual daunger of life. And whereas shipmen are the vnhappiest 165 of all men, they be there with withall the vngratioust of all parsons. But emonge all these handie craftes, marchaundise, husbandrie, warrefare, Phisicke, & pleadinge be the chiefest, of whiche we will speake hereafter in order. But firste let vs discusse the generall fundations of Economie. The whole efficacie of Priuate gouernment standeth in Matrimonie, wherfore Metellus Numidicus the Censour, when he exhorted the people of Rome to marrie, saide: Oye Romans if we coulde liue without 166 wiues, we al should seeke to auoide ye trouble:but because nature hath so taught, that by no meanes with them, nor wtout them, we maie liue contodiously enough, we ought rather to pronide for euerlasting salstee, then for fadinge pleasure: these thinges Aulus Gellius recompteth. And truely no house, or housholde affaire can endure, and be of continuaunce, without a wife:for without a wife kinred 167 cannot be encreased, nor heire be named, nor enheritaunce be called, nor kinsfolke, nor familie, nor father of the familie can be saide. He that hath no wife, hat no house, because he doth not faste his house: and if he haue, he dwelleth therein as a straunger in an Inne: he that hath no wife, although he be exceadinge riche, he hath almost nothinge, which maie be called his, because, he hath not to whome he maie leaue it, nor to whom to trust, all that he hath is in daunger of spoile: his seruauntes robbe him, his companions beguile him, his neighbours dispise him, his friendes regarde him not:his kinsfelke seeke his vndoinge:if he hath any childern out of Matrimonie, they tourne him to shame, wherefore the lawes forbidde him to leaue them, neither the name of their familie, nor the armes of theire predecessours, nor their substaunce, and he is also togeather with them put backe from al publike offices and dignitees, by the consente of all lawe makers. For he is vnworthie to rule a Citie whiche 168 hath not learned to gouerne his house: nor to beare stroke in the common weale, whiche neuer knewe to gouerne his priuate and housholde affaires, whiche is the very example and image thereof. The Greekes perceaued this, whom when Philippe of Macedonie endeuored to bringe to atonement beinge at discorde, and Gorgias Leontinus had recited in Olimpia, a booke of the Greekes concorde conteptuously reiceting the one & the other, they laughed them to skorne, because they endeuoured to sit others at vnitee, whiche coulde not establishe concorde in 169 discorde, and Gorgias his wife and maide, wherefore they thought that whose presumptuouse prudencie and authoritee was not able to appease housholde contention, coulde not wisely conclude outwarde discordes. He then whiche is set to rule a Citie and common weale, if first he know not how to gouerne him selfe, his house, and his substaunce, he vndoubtedly taketh that charge in vaine. This finally is the onely state of life, wherin a man maie leade the happiest life of al, in louing his wife, in bringinge vp his children, in gouerninge his familie, in sauinge his substance, in rulinge his house, & in encreasinge his offpringe: wherein if any charge and labour happen (for very many doo chaunce, and no state of life is without his crosse) verely this onely is that lighte burden, and sweete yoke, whicheis in wedlocke: if so be the wiues be suche, whome not auarice, not pride, not deceipte, not sraude, not peeuish appetite, but God himselfe hath ioygned togeather, to the ende that a man shoulde forsake his Father and Mother, Sonnes, brothers, kinsmen, & cleaue to his wife, whose loue ought to surpasse the affection of all other. In this wife Hector seeinge Troye fallinge to ruine, was not afflicted so muche with the thought of his parentes, not of his brethren, not of him selfe, as of his deare wife. For after this manner he speaketh in Homer. I doo not doubt, but stately Troye , will haue a greeuous fall: And warrelike Priams people eke, and Priame shalbe thrall. But care of people, nor of Syre, nor eke of Priame kinge: Nor brothers, though many of them, and woorthie in each thinge Shall die in handes of foes, so much doo pinch my pensiffe harte: As care of thee my dearest wife, doth vexe and cause me smaite. I confesse that many troubles and verations doo accompanie naughtie Mariages, such as Socrates sometime declared, continuall care, tormentinge ielousie, perpetuall quarrels, vpbraidinge of dowrie, sower lookes of the parentes: comparison of an other mans mariage, diuerse expenses, doubtfull endes of children, sometime lacke of them, death of ofspringe, a straunge heire, & infinite sorrowes: adde hereto no choise of the wife, but to be taken what euer shee be, whether pleasaunt, or foolishe, or ill mannered, or prowde, or fowle, or deformed, or vnchaste, euery defaulte that shee hath, is knowne after mariage: but with much adoo or neuer it is redressed. There are examples of vnequall mariages: Marcus Cato the Censour in his time without controuersie, te chiefest of the Romane common wealth, who vneth had in warre and peace his equall, when in his olde age he had taken to wife a younge wenche, daughter of one Salomo a poore man, and of base estate, shee behauinge her selfe disobediently did beare no rule in his house. Tiberius manifest adulteries, daringe not to chastice her, not accuse her, not fortake her, not retaine her, was enforced to goe to Rhodes, not without blotte of good name, and perill of life. M. Antonius the Philosopher, when he had taken being an adultresse, least he should come in contention for the dowrie and empire. But all these incommodities happen not so much through the faulte of wiues, as thorowe the errour of husbandes, for an vnhonest wife is not wonte to chaunce to none, but naughtie husbandes. Of this matter Varro in Gellius reasoneth in this wife, sayinge: The faulte of the wife is either to be taken awaie, or endured, he that taketh it awaie, maketh her more tractable & easie: he that endureth her, maketh him selfe better. Hereof we haue spoken more at large in our declamation vpon the Sacrairent of Matrimonie. Beside this also, ye bringing vp of children, hath not turned well to all men, many of whiche haue either an ill name, or disobedient to theire parentes, some also hate them, some chaunce foolishe and mad, and some blockish, and grosse headed, some runne headlonge into all vices, and spende their patrimonie in riote, in sensualitee, and in dice plaie: some kil the which begat them, as Alomeon, Orestes, and P. Malleoles, whiche killed theire mothers. And Artaxarces Mnemon also hauinge a hundreth and fiftene sonnes, slewe a great parte of them, which conspired his death. Wherefore very well saithe Euripides, and our Barnarde hath receaued it, that it is an vnknowen good to be without children. Augustus also that most happie Emperoure, was oftentimes enforced bicause of his doughter and neece, to vse this verse of Homer. I would to God, I had nor wife nor childe. Euripides like wife saithe in this manner of seruauntes: There is at home no greater enimie, nor worse, nor more vnprofitable, then a seruaunt. And Democritus saithe: A seruaunte is a necessarie possession, but not profitable. Petrarcha wrote also in a certaine place: I knewe well that I liued with dogges, but I knewe not that I was a hunter, had I not benne aduised. Seruauntes be called dogges, because they are snappishe, they be gluttonous, expresse their natures. A kinde of men woorthie whippinge, which neuer haue in minde any good thinge: but when occasio is geuen them, holde, steale, robbe, this is their practise, that thou were better to leaue woulfes emonge sheepe, then these to keepe thy house. And Lucianus in Palinurus saithe: The misreportes, the robberies, the deceiptes, the renning awaie, the arrogancie, the negligence, the drunkennesse, the gormandise, the sluggishnesse, the flothfulnesse, the lithernesse of seruauntes towardes theire Maisters are alwaies readie. Hereof is spronge that Prouerbe: wee haue so many enimies at home, as we haue seruauntes. But oftentimes we haue 170 not them so muche our enimies, as we make them, when we are prowde, couetous, spitefull, and cruell towardes them, and at home we put on tirauntes mindes, and will beare rule ouer our seruaunts, not as it besemeth, but as it pleaseth vs. Of this matter Strophilus the seruaunte speaketh after this sorte in Plautus, in the Comedie Aulularia. The Maisters now their seruauntes doo misuse, The seruauntes to obaie them doo refuse. So on no side is done that, whiche is righte, The nigh olde men keepe all thinges from their fighte. And with a thousande keies they faste locke doo, Stoore house, kitchinge, cellar, and buttrie too So that, vneth their children they in lette, The theuishe and the subtill seruauntes sette The doores wide open, with a thousande keyes, And closly filch, purloine, and goe their waies. They neuer for a hundreth hanginges, will Disclose their theftes So seruauntes that be ill, Reuenge their bondage doo, with sporte and plaie. I then conclude, if bountie beare the swaie: That sernauntes still wil walke in vpright waie. wonderfull greate damages by seruauntes: the seruill waries written of many historiographers do witnesse ye, but namely ye Citie of Volsinium aboundinge in wealth, garnished with customes and lawes, in time paste did set foorth a lamentable sight of the presumption of seruants, which dealinge too familiarly with their seruantes in geuinge them the bridle at will, did oftentimes cal them to counsailes, at length some of them presumed to enter into the order of Senatours, shortly after they vsurped the gouernaunce of the publike weale, they caused Testamentes to be written at their pleasure, they forbadde the bankettes and assemblies of free men, they Maried the doughters of their Masters, lastly the made a lawe that their aduoutries in widowes, & vnmaried women should be vnpunished, and that no virgin shoulde marrie a free man, if one of them had not first deflowred her, after this manner a greate riche Citie, whiche was the principall towne in Caria, by reason of too much libertie and gentlenesse towardes seruauntes, sustained great iniuries and villanie. For, as Aristotle saithe in his Politickes, if the correction of seruaunts be taken away, the masters come to destruction, as the Hilotes did againste the Lacedemonians, and the Prenestins It remaineth that briefly we speake of the Kinges housholde, that is, of the Courte. The Courte then in effeste is nothinge els but a colledge of Giauntes, that is, an assembly of noble men, and famouse knaues, and a Theater of most wicked waiters, a schoole of very corrupt customes, and a refuge of detestable wickednesse: where pride, arrogancie, bigge lookes, extorcio, sensualitee, riot, enuie, anger, surfetinge, violence, crueltee, malice, disloyaltee, deceipte, malignitee, exedulitee, and what vices so euer be els where, & most corrupte customes doo dwell, gouerne and rule: where defloratios, rapes, adulteries, & fornications be the pastimes of Princes & Nobles:where also the mothers of Princes and Kinges, be otherwhile bawdresses to their Sonnes: there be stormie tempestes of all mischiefes, and an vnspeakeable wrecke of all vertues: euery honeste man is there oppressed, and euery ribaulde is auaunced, the simple menne be laughed to skorne, and the iuste are persecuted, presumptuouse and shamelesse parsons be fauoured. None but flatteres doo prosper there, and whisperers, sclaunderers, talebearers, false accusers, complainers, abusers, venemous tongues, supplanters, inuentours of mischiefes, & other pestilent people, whiche professe al kinde of shamefull actes:whose life is wholye voyde of shame, and what naughtines so euer in any place is found in cruel beasts, al this seemeth to be assembled in the route of courtiers, as in one body:there is found the fiercenesse of the Lion, the crueltie of the Tiger, the truculencie of the Beare, ye beastely rashnesse of the Boore, the pride of the Horse, the rauine of the Wolfe, the obstinacie of the Ore, the deceit of the Fore, the mutabilitie of the Chameleon, the varietie of the Liberde, the biting of the Dogge, the despeiratnesse of the Elephant, the reuengment of the Camel, the fearefulnes of the Hare, the lasciuiousnes of ye Goate, the vncleanes of the Sowe, the simplicitie of the Sheepe, the follie of the Asse, the scoffinge of the Ape:there be the furious Centaures, ye perilous Chimeres, the woode Satires, the filthy Harpies, the dishonest Sirenes, ye biformed Scilles, there the horrible Ostriches, ther the greedy Griphes, & terribel Dragons, and what straunge and feareful monsters nature euer created againste her will, doo dwell and are seene: there all kindes of vertues endure theire tormentours, and tyrauntes: to be short they must abide in wickednesse, naughtinesse or impietie, or departe from the Courte. None but fooles escape vnpunished: let him leaue the Courte, that wilbe good. There can chaunce no mischiefe more pestilente to Cities, then the Courte of a mightie Lorde. When this is moued, as it were a comete the messenger of all mischiefes, and no otherwife then a verye infectiue plague, to euery place where it arriueth, bringeth with it a very daungerous destruction: from whencesoeuer it departeth, it leaueth vncurable tokens of his poyson, as of them whom a mad dogge hath biten. A continual dearth of things doth accompany it, whilest that euery man endeuoureth to gaine thereby, in enhausinge the price of thinges whiche neuer afterwarde with great losse can be brougth downe: dayntines of face doth also accompanie it, whereupon when strange meats were brought in, the people began to abhorre theire countrie fare, and euery where geuinge themselues to feede and chearish the carkeis, do dishounestly consume theire substauce, Pride also doth accompanie it, which whilest that citizens & women going about to countersait, & al houses taking from thence the manner & facion of theire attire, doo spende al theire goodes on apparalle, and pompe. Corruptio of maners doth folow, a most pestilent mischiefe, in bringing in very wicked vices. And when the Courte departeth from a citie, alas what a filthy taile leaueth it behinde: these finde their wiues aduouterers, they, their daughters, deflowred, or els carried awaye for hoores, others supplanted childern, or theire seruauntes, & maides corrupted. What neede many woordes: there is woderful great lamentatio, & the whole face of the citie is changed, like ye face of an harlot. I know a famous citie in Frauce, for this cause so corrupt. ye scarcely there is seene any chast wife, hardly mens daughters be maried virgins: but rather repute it a greate honoure to haue ben a hoore of the court, and the elder wome are bawdresses to the yonger, and this dishonestie hath so growe in vse, that no shame remaineth, and the husbandes themselues do vneth passe for theire wiues whoordome, so that (as Abraham delitiously for theire sake. The people of the Courte is of twoo sortes: ye Dukes & Erles be te chiefest, I meane these noble Thrasoes, whiche dote in pride, riote, and pompe, clad in purple, silke, and worke of feathers, in embrodered and golden garmentes. VVhiche do delite in whoores, in striding steppes they pleasure take: In staringe lookes, and sundrie sortes, of garmentes straunge to make. These tame their strength in Uenerie, theire throte and tast is daintie, thei euery where, desire to go in gorgeous apparaile, they fare sumptuously, thei geue aud take bankets. Thei oftentimes accopt it an honour, if in a famous bankette at one time, they riottously consume their substaunce in suche wife, that for the space of a quarter of a peare after, they impudently go to other mennes tables. About these, from al partes, flocke harpars, pipers, and al kindes of musitians, boorders, plaiers, parasites, harlots, bawdes, dauncers, hunters, and suche like monsters of men, they feede dogges, horses, goshawkes, sperhawkes, and other birdes of pray, apes, popinlayes, and if there be any monsters, and outcastes of nature, beares, lyons, liberds, tigers. Their communications are meere tifles, & idle fables, they sclaunder, accnse, disclose secretes, lye, & mingle true thinges with false, these babble muche of howndes, huntinge, of the compasse of the woode, of the daungerous and doubtful dennes of wilde beastes, of the endes of ye chases: thei make many lies, of horses, of warfarre, and of woorthy enterprises by them atcheiued. If there by any enuious men presente, enterruptinge other mens communication he maketh a noyse, entermingling other trifles, and arrogantly will recken vp his valiaunt deedes, whiche he thinketh, doo purchase him prayse:and other oftentimes doth conuicte him of a lye, & with sundrie scosfes hisseth him out of the place, wherfore not seldome the whole feasting communication doth at that time end in choler, and contumelye, and as it befell in the bankets of the Centaures, the cuppes and goblets cease not to flee about vntil the bloude runne aboute theire eares. And so oftentimes straungers retourne from the tables of these courtiers with woundes and broken heades, as if they had bene bidden with this condition. The remnaunt is, ye merrie men your bodies wel defende VVith stomake stoute, and ready be, to fight we do intende. The chiefest knowledge that these menne haue, is to obserue the most conuenient times to speake with princes, to the ende they may not propounde any thinge to them out of season, & they electe not these times by the starres, by the heauens, or by the Ephimerides, but by bowsing, by dining, by bankettinge, by hnting, or by rest, when the kinge is pleasauntly disposed, & hath obtayned his desire in some thinge, and if they knowe any other fauourable times of accesse:then they begin first to spreade rumours of newes, which delite the eares of the prince:afterward by little and little thei proceede to that which they desire, hauing the counsaile of Aristotle to Calisthenes his scholler, writen in the by nature, euhorting him that he should neuer or very pleasauntlye speake with a Kinge, to the ende that at the Kinges eares he shoulde be either more salfe thorow silence, or more acceptable thorowe his communication. But if perhaps the Prince or Kinge shall at that time make a good countenaunce to any of them, and alloweth that which he speaketh, if he shal saye or doo any thinge, which is acceptable, if he hath beleued him in any thinge, if he hathe called him into a priuie place to talke with him, & hath not don the like to other, he then doubtlesse shalbe greatly esteemed of men, and nowe he wil begin to make al thinges leefull, he will detract all men, he wil skorne all men, he will set naught by all men, he will speake ill of men behinde their backes, he wil reproue me openly, he wil speake prowde and stately woordes, he wil enterprise to doo euery thing, to the end that al men maie feare him, he wil treade his inferiours vnder foote, he wil dispise his equals, he wil disdaine his superiours, he will not only be honoured, but adored, and that with spitefull woordes, he swelleth & puffeth vp with pride, & earnestly desireth to be of authoritie. Theire vertue and theire chiefest power is freedome to offende. He that smileth not on him, & alloweth not euery thinge that he doth to be good, although he doth amisse, straighte waies he hath committed a hainous offence, for he shalbe iudged to enuie his fortune, or not to haue respecte to his duty, neither the be these alone malicious to their equals and inferiours, but oftentimes also they are very daungerous to Princes themselues, whom they most wickedly doo flatter vnder couer of truthe, prudencie, reprouse, & counsaile, and many times also they incense them to do horrible actes, euen as in Lucane, Curio stirreth C aesar. VVhat hath helde backe and made thy force so feeble, we complaine? Didst thou not trust in vs? whilst this warme bloude doth rule and raigne. In breathinge bodes of vs all and whilst these brawnie boanes Shal able be fel dartes to flinge wilt thou permit the gownes Vnnoble, and the senate eke to take the rule in hande? more, to warres, and slaughters, he bringe of his owne nature fierce. Suche counsailers also had Roboam the sonne of Salomon: suche also haue the Princes of our time, whiche fulfillinge theire desires, do not onely obaye them, but also pricke them forewarde to all wickednesse: or els doo disswade them, in such sort, that they doo more instatly prouoke them whilest they alleage very vaine and feeble reasons: to the ende that suffering themselues in this wise to be conuicted, may confirme the erroure of princes, which be of light beleefe: so deceiuing the one part and the other, that they cannot be reprehended, but beside this, they deserue thanks for disloyal treason. Such had, Fraunces the Frenche Kinge, veray readye to wicked counsailes, which willingly did incense him to all treason and tyrannye againste the Emperoure: and in the meane season they are esteemed beste, and faithefull. These be sufficient concerninge the nobles of the courte, of whiche he that shall offende one, is culpable of all the reste. There be also certaine common Courtiers, men of a lewde minde, whiche in all theire life time haue no authoritee ouer any man, but they delighte to be in continuall subiectio, these goo from one noble mans house to an other, and holde vp their tales for a dinner or supper liuinge at other mens tables. And it suppose a souraigne good to liue by others food. For that cause they be seruisable to al men, thei flatter al men, they playe the parasites with all men, and with all men they endeuour to be al thinges, counterfaiting more shapes then Protheus did, and turninge themselues into more formes, to get the fauoure of great men, they bende their minds to espie the communications of the feasters, to haue what to tell afterwarde, and with subtiltee of the fore they search out their secrets, which be at variaunce, and sometime declare them to theire friendes, sometime to their enimies, shewinge themselues friendly to bothe parties, whilest that to the one side & the other they be vnfaithful: & so much the more they be meete for treasons, as they be accompted lesse suspected for the fayninge of simplicitee. And although there be no offece more hainous then treason, notwithstanding ye Courtiers haue no other thing more profitable & auailable in ye Court to get riches, and dignitees, then this, and more grateful and acceptable to Kinges, and therefore they hange about noble mees houses, and they wil knowe the secretes of the house, and for this to be feared. And if they haue bene once partie to any dishonestie, or treason, then they escape, then they looke bigge. For deare he shalbe to Verres, ye at all times can accuse Verres. Than they purchase a certain acquaintaunce and familiar friendship with noble men, wherein they trustinge, do easily compasse that they desire. And therefore they seeke first to be enrolled emong the Courtiers, and that sufficeth them euen without any stipend, for the title alone without wages is gaineful, & hath his pray: moreouer thei do not mistrust to get the fauoure of noble men whatsoeuer thei be, whom they do then allure with flattery, and inforce with humble seruice, & thruste themselues into offices for the respecte of friendshippe or for some other crafte, and they very greedely seeke all suche thinges, whiche others haue forsaken either for feare of daungers, or for impatience of laboures, or for slendernesse of gaine, they watche daye and nighte, they trauaile into straunge countries, and carrie and recarrie theire enterprised embassages, and letters, they attempt and endure great labours, & vndertake to do some thinge woorthy of the gaile & gallowes, vntil by meanes of these merites they be made secretaries, or haue the office of the seale, or obtaine the keaping of the treasure, or diuers accomptes of the reuenewe be put into theire handes. And hauinge escaped the extremities of labours, they will doo nomore seruice without recopence: but afterwarde wilbe rewarded for al thinges: and hauing togeather with their late receiued honour chaunged theire manners and forgettinge al thinges past, and waxinge ambitious, doo dispise their firste offices, alwayes desiringe higher promotion, and ledde with couetousnes doo turne all thinges to the praye, and sounde of gayne, nigaides in faithe, prodigal in woordes, at one instaunt courtcise and traiterous, darke in talke, and doubtfull like Oracles, whatsoeuer they see, whatsoeuer they heare, whatsoeuer is don, they take al at the wurste, they truste themselues alone, they loue themselues alone, they prouide for themselues, they truste no mans faithe or friendship, they keepe companie with none but for profites sake, they preferre their owne commoditee before al things, they despise, like vnfruitful trees, all theire friendes, guestes, kinsmen, and companions, that bring no gaine, if any of them meete with their olde companions, they passe by them, as if they knewe them not: if any of these craue his fauoure, him they feede plenteously enough with woordes and promises, and promise 171 more then they performe, if he bringe nothinge, thei leaue him without helpe, or els they loose their suite, they sell all their fauoure, they despise all vertue, and disteine other mennes praises with sundrie opinions, and artificiallye doo sclaunder euery man behinde his backe, they prayse noman without exception, like as that oratoure saide, I confesse that Iulius Fortunatus is a woorthy man, and it is manifestly knowen that he hathe atcheiued many valiaunte enterprises, nothwithstandinge if I had not knowne the force of his eloquence, I should muche marueile by what meane he escaped iudgemente of briberie and extorcion. And an other saithe: A happy man in sonne and wife was Protheus , in blisse He had ben, if through Phocus death he had not donne a misse. Furthermore they alwaies stande gapinge like Rauins, for giftes of the Courte, they prole for profitte on euery wonte to take meate euen out of Phin aeus mouth. They reioyce in the misfortune of suche as seeke to excel them, they take compassion on no mans miserie, they thinke not them selues bounde to keepe promisse with any man, but at theire pleasure, they requite no mans kindnesse, but deeme euery man a like vnwoorthy of benefite, or through negligence passe them ouer, some they recompence with hatred: but they faigne loue in hatred, & dissemble choler: they honour and reuerence no parson beside the King and the Prince, but not these boubtlesse, if were not for feare, or gaine. And when, they conuersaunt in treasons, deceiptes, sorrowes, and labours vntill they be hoare headed, haue with these painefull and filthy practises gotten great riches, & aspired to highe honours, then they sette no difference betwene right & wronge, that their sonnes maie be heires, not so much of honour, as of rauine, and iniquitee. So doth the Storke her younge ones feede with Lisardes founde in fielde. They also seeke the same when flushe they flee and make them yeelde. So doth the Egles fierce and other woorthie birdes in woode, Still hunte the Hare and Goate and bringe the praie to nest for foode. And afterwarde whrn that the younge be ripe they hast do make, Vnto the praie, when hunger leane doth cause their entrailes ake Assone as they haue tasted it when out of egge they rake. And these be the practises of the common Courtiers, by meanes of which many borne of base bloudde haue benne aduaunced to verie great Offices, Treasourshippes, and dignitees, & hauinge gotten the nexte authoritie to these Kinges, and Princes, they heape vp riches equall to Lordes, and builde princely Places: whilest in the meane season the noble Courters doo spende all theire liuelode vpon queans, dise, huntinge, iustinge, feasting, pompes, apparaile, and pride, consuminge their landes, castels, possessions, and inheritaunce: whiche then these common Courtiers buye, succedinge in the place of the nobles, by means of their moste wicked practises. The women of the Courte haue also theire vices. For alwaie we see manie endowed with goodly giftes of the body, fayre, preatie, handsome, and comely. Moreouer richely attired in Purple, Golde, Iewels, and owches: but all men cannot see what filthy monsters doo often lurke vnder those faire skinnes. For that cause Luciane very aptly dothe compare them to the Egyptian Temples. For there the Churche is very faire without, and also very greate, builte and wrought with costely stoanes, but if thou seeke within for theire God, thou shalte finde either an Ape, a Storke, a Goate, or a Catte. So is it of those gentlewomen and Ladies of the Courte, which nourished from their infancie, and tender yeares in lither idelnesse, in daunsinge, and in all superfluitee, & nousled in most wicked doctrine, of those courtly bookes of loue, and naughtie histories, comebies, nouels, pleasaunt iestes, and songes of sensualitee, luste, aduoutries, fornications, and bawdries, haue sucked as it were of theire nurishe moste damnable manners, lightnesse, pride, arrogancie, disdaine, impudencie, dishonestie, contention, ouerthwartinge, stubbournesse, reuengment, crafte, slinesse, malapartnesse, pratlinge, saucinesse, and dishonest luste, they haue toungers, to the whiche silence is a paine: they haue mouthes armed for al kindes of clatteringe trifles, with whiche they vtter idle & foolish communication, and oftentimes displeasant to these, that be compelled to heare them. For what shoulde we thinke them to speake emonge themselues so many howers, but foolish & idle thinges? as, how the heare should be dressed, how it should be kembed, how the heare should be coloured, how the face should be rubbed, after what facion the garment should be playted, and with what pompe they should goo, rise, and sit, & what attire they should weare, to what persons they should geue place, with how many bowinges falute, what women, and whome they should kisse, or not kisse, what women ought to ride vpon an Asse, horse, seate & be caried in a chariote, or couche: what women male weare Golde, Pearle, Corall, Chaines, kinges hanginge at their eares, Braslets, Kinges, and Tablets, and other trifles of Semiramis lawes. There be also auncient Matrons, whiche tell, how many wo wers they haue had, how many giftes thei haue receaued, with how many flatteringe woordes they haue benne wowed: this woman talketh of him whome shee loueth, that woman can not scantly forbeare to speake of him whom shee hateth, and euery one thinketh that shee speaketh with the admiration of other women, sometimes they mainetaine talke with fonde quippies, or very impudente lies. There wante not emonge them cruell hatredes, & eger brawlinges, malitiouse detractions, backebitinges, false accusations, and whatsoeuer be the vices of a naughtie tongue: they haue eies, they haue coutenances, they haue laughters, full of flickeringe enticementes: they haue beckes, they haue gestures full of wantonnesse: they haue subtiltees and woordes, with whiche they entice and deceaue their louers, and enforce them to giue giftes: if thei haue a ringe, a pearle, an owche, a pretie chaine, what so euer it be, they gette it with flatterie, or obtaine it with intreatinge, and render for them kisses, kindnesse, entertainmentes, embracinges, carnal desire, talkinge togeather, which be to them common marchaundize, & norishmentes of courtly loue. I am ashamed to reporte what secrete dishonesties be oftentimes done in their chabers, when they are maried, in the despite of nature, which after that they haue put on theire clothes, suppose to haue couered and hidden all thinges, therefore of what faithe & honestie shall we thinke such wiues to be afterwarde towardes their husbandes? O how sorrowful doo thei make their good husbandes, when continually they obiecte to them their linage, dowrie, beautie, and other mens mariages, and with scoldinge and tauntinge doo weary their husbandes, they alwaies lamente, whilest they dispise housholde and temperate fare, and twite their husbandes with the courtly excesse, and beinge enured in pleasaunt fantasies, and gloriouse ostentation, doo consunie theire riches vpon superfluouse ornamentes, they bring houses to ruine, oftentimes they enforce theire miserable husbandes to dishonest and naughtie gaines, whom daie and might they seeke to destroie with a thousande deceiptes, with dissimulation, treason, and hipocrisie. I speake not of straunge loues, of hidden aduoutries, of others children put in place of theirs, and issue conceaued of other mens seede: but if they once turne to hatred, they will faigne ielousie or prepare poyson: for (as Hierome medecines, and Magicall vanitees be the familiar Artes 172 to the death: Lucilia killed hers thorow felousie, that woman willingly ministred to her husband payson to drinke, this lewde woman made her husbande madde, geuinge him an amorous drinke. Therefore it is saulfer dwelling (as Ecclesiasticus saith) with a Lion and Dragon, then with a wicked woman. He that will haue an obedient wife, lette him not marrie a Courtier. She that will haue an honest husbande, let her not wedde a Courtier. But now my communication is too farre gone with my tounge, notwithstanding I haue spoken it, and I coulde not but haue spoken it. But I wil laie my hande vpon my mouth, & adde nothinge els to that I haue spoken, and therefore passinge now from the Courte, let vs examine the other partes of Economie, or ordered house- keaping, and the doctrines which we haue saide to be the chiefest emonge the handicraftes, that is, Marchaundise, Husbandrie, Warrefare, and the reste. Marchaundise is a very subtill searcher out of preuy gaines, a very greadie goulse of manifest spoyle: neuer content with enough, but alwaies very miserable for the desire to gette: many notwithstandinge haue supposed this to be no small healpe to the common wealth, fitte to purchase friendshippe of foraine Princes, and Aliens, and also much profitinge the priuate life of men, and after a certaine facion necessarie to the same: and Plinie demeth that it was founde out for liuinges sake, wherefore many noble and wise men haue not dispised to practise the feate of Marchaundise, such manner of men (as Plutarche witnesseth) were Thales, Solon,  173 Hippocrates: but as we doo allowe all Sciences, & Artes some for pleasure, some we esteeme for trauaile, some we learne for vertue and honestie, some we reuerence for truthe and iustice, yet although they all be necessarie, gainefull, pleasaunt, and laboursome, therefore not honest, commendable, and righteouse. In this wise also the exercises of Marchauntes, retailers, vsurers, bankers, sowkers be necessarie, profitable, & laboursome, notwithstandinge they are termed seruile, dishonest, & naughtie trades of gaine: because not theire Artes, but busie deceiptes are solde and bought, whiche (as Cicero saithe) is not the dutie of an honest, plaine, noble, iuste, nor good man, but of a naughtie, base borne, subtill, craftie and a wilie. For all Marchauntes, and retailers buye in one place, to sell dearer in an other and aboue the principall, and he is accompted the beste, which gaineth most, whose propertie is to lie, to forsweare, to deceaue, and beguile, and no kinde of gaine is to them dishonest: but they saie that the lawes do licence them to deceiue such as traficke with them, vnto one halfe of the iuste price, & there is no doubte, but they commit very many shamefull matters, and deceiptes woorthy of punishment, seeinge al their life 174 is bente to gaine, lucre, & riches. For none ware wealthy without deceipte, and (as Augustine saithe) he that dothe not deceaue, can not gaine. He that doth seeke to sel his wares, and haue the bought, Doth prayse them more then he of dutie ought. The Marchaunt false, for sweareth God for gaine, Deseruinge nothinge lesse then euer lastinge paine. For this cause one buyeth, an other selleth: this man carieth, that man taketh vp: this is the creditour, he is the debitoure: this man payeth, that man receauethian other writeth the accomptes, but all sweare vntruely, deceiue, and beguile: & refuse no daunger of the soule, of the body, nor of fortune, so that they be in hope of profite, & doo not fauour and esteeme kinred, affinitees, and friendship for any faithe, but for profite sake alone: and so all men in al ages runne after wealth, and after riches, as if quietnesse from cares, and comforte of life coulde not be founde els where: The painefull marchaunt to the fardest Indes his course doth runne, Through seas, in seking wealth, through rockes, through heate of scorchiange Sunne. But there is no man, whiche is ignoraunt, whiche seeth not, whiche feeleth not what deceiptes Marchauntes doo committe in woulle, in flare, in silke, in clothe, in purple, in pearle, in spices, in ware, in oyle, in wine, in corne, in horses, and in other beastes, finally in all kinde of Manchaundise, except perhappes he which hath not felte their damage. And these be the leste mischiefes, farre greater then these are behinde. These be they, that bringe in hurtfull Marchaundise, whiche women and children desire either for seldomnesse, or recreation, whiche tende to no necessitee of life, but onely to superfluitee, to pompe, to beautifiynge, to pastime, to delicatenesse, and pleasure, bringinge them in from the fardest partes of the worlde, as it were snares. They yearly spoyls Countries and kingedomes of muche monie: they corrupte good manners bringinge in foraine vices, and takinge awaie their countries guise, doo studie for newe and strange things, and wrappe it in moste damnable customes. These be they, that makinge felowshippes doo ordaine faires againste honestie, dutie, and the lawes, assayinge, deuisinge and sekinge all thinges, whereby they maie geate ye goodes of the multitude, whilest, whe they haue gathered monie togeather they ouercome some, they preuente some, they seare some from buying, by raysinge the price of thinges, and they alone buye all thinges, which afterwarde they sell as deare as they liste. They oftentimes, when they are farre in debte, & haue planted theire dwellinge els where, and haue loste theire credite in for sakinge their countrie, and late or neuer retourning home doo deceaue theire creditours, and make them to dispaire and hange themselues. These be they that wrappe and flaye the Citizens with billes of debte and obligations, plantinge the rootes of theire debtes so deepe, painefull, cruell, and ineuitable, that they cannot be plucked vp, but growinge rounde togeather, and causinge debtes to springe of debtes doo strangle and ouerturne Cities? and they in the meane while incessauntly geuen to vsurie, doo deuoure the substaunce of all the people, they sometimes clippe the Coyne, but they doo alwaies sometimes raise, sometimes bringe downe the valewe of the monie, as they thinke it aualleable for them, not without the damage of the whole publike wealth. They disclose to the enimite the secreates of Princes, whiche they haue espied, the counsailes of Cities, and newes of the Countrie, sometimes also for a peece of monie, they lie in waite to kill Princes, and assaie, suffer, doo, and sell all thinges for the loue of monie. All theire trade is nothinge els but lies, dissimulation, clowdes of woordes, preuie searchinge, 175 conspiracie, deceiptes, and open treason. For this cause the men of Carthage appointed seuerall shoppes for Marchauntes, and woulde not haue them to be common with the Citizens: notwithstandinge they mighte freely goe to the market. But they were not suffered to come to the shipdockes, and the secretest places of the Citie, no not to see them. The Greekes did not receaue them into theire Cities, but to the ende that the Citizens should be free from suspition of daunger, they appointed ye market without the Suburbes. Many other Nations did forbid Marchants to come to them, bicause they corrupted manners. The Epidaurians, at this daie called the Raguseans, (as Plutarche witnesseth) when they perceaued theire Citizens to be made naughte, through the entercourse and trafficke which they had with the Slauonians, doubtinge that newe thinges should be stired vp in their Citie, through the conuersation of straungers, hauinge corrupted the manners of theire Citizens, they did yearly choose a very graue and circumspecte man, out of the whole multitude of the Citizens, which wente to Slauonye, and bought such things, as euery one of his countrie 176 thei do corrupt good manners, and thinketh good it be prohibited by the lawe, in a well ordered common wealth, lest the soolishe fantasies of forayne nations should be brought into the citie, and that no citisen vnder fourtie yeares shoulde trauasle into straunge cuntries: and that alies should be sent home, bicause that through such like infections of straungers, the citizens do vnlearne and beginne to hate the forepassed sparing, and auncient customes of their predecessours: through which one thinge, many times cities be come very wicked, and wholy defiled with al kinde of fornications, aduoutries, luxuriousnesse, and dishonestie. Lyons, and Antwarpe at this day very famous faires of Marchaunts doo geue such examples. Aristotle also commaundeth, that wee must bee careful, that the cities be not corrupted with the mixture of forraine thinges, and albeit Marchaunts be necessary, yet he woulde not that they shoulde be receiued in the number of citizens: which also he doth exceedingly detest, bicause they delite in lies, and in the cities do trouble the the markets, stere vp tumuites, and sowe debats. There was moreouer an ancient law in many comon wealthes, that no marchaunte shoulde beare office, and shoulde not be admitted into the senate, nor Counsaile. The Marchauntes trade is altogeather condemned by the opinios of diuines, and by the Canon decrees, by the authoritie of Gregorie, Chrysostome, Augustine, Cassiodore, the marchaunt cannot please God. Let no Christian than be a marchaunt, and if he wilbe, let him be excommunicated. Augustine also saith, that marchaunts and souldiars cannot truely repent. Treasourers be not much better then marchauntes, a certaine theuishe kinde of men, and for the moste part seruil and hired for monie, or els because they bestowe their laboure for wages, rude, and slouthful, but presumptuous, and shamelesse: they learne nothinge but certaine slender knowledges, as it is meete for such men to knowe, that is to witte, formes of writinge, of casting accopt, but chiesly of robbing, not foolish, but more witty then these which appertaine to common theeues. And for this cause they be the veriest theeues in the worlde, and rich through the fingers onely, with which they caste accompts of talents and millions, which they haue so clammie like birdlime, and beset with infinite croked hookes, that all mony how light soeuer it be fleeting, sliding, and slippery like adders and cales, touched of these doth stike faste, nor can easily be taken awaye. Notwithstandinge they be in this lesse hurtful, aswel because they doo robbe the treasours of none but Kings, Princes, & noble me, as also because that which they haue stolen fro thence, they willlingly spende vpo queans, dise, bankets, buildings, and in feeding of parasits, horses, howndes, and players. Orels waren elder, and wiser oftentimes doo leaue such 177 childern behind them, which vnhappily consume al that, cuttinge it in many peeces whiche theire fathers by little and little, and by peece meale haue scratched togeather wt many periuries, with robberies, with theftes, with damnable deedes, in feastinge queanige, huntinge, fowlinge and attiringe: and omittinge nothinge to the accomplishing of theire desires. Moreouer also treasourers take vsury, and deferringe paymentes, doo constrayne the pensioners to giue rewardes, they robbe debts, captains and they lay their heads togeather, thei make false accompts, they counterfaite obligations, and open letters that be sealed, and signed with forged seales, they clippe the coine, somtimes thei falsifie it with coloured mettal, and therefore they are great friendes to the Alchimistes, and for the moste parte doo professe that arte, or if they wante wit, at least wise be fauourers thereof. But for somuche as Cicero saith, that marchaundise ought not to be much despised, if it be greate and plentifull, bringinge many thinges from all partes, and without vanitie and that Marchauntes and treasourers maye then of very good right be prayse, if at any time satisfied with gayne, at length doo employe themselues to till and trime theire groundes and possessions: and therefore wee will adde here vnder, what is to be thought of husbandrie. Husbandrie therfore, whereunto pasturing, fishing, and hunting are aunexed, was so muche honoured emonge the Auncientes, that the Romaine Emperoures and renowmed Kinges and Captaines, were not ashamed to laboure the grounde, to sowe graine, & plante 178 gouernaunce, and Attalus, also when he had lefte the administration of his realme. Cyrus also, that great king of ye Persians, was accustomed to auaunt exceedingly, whe he shewed to his friends that came vnto him an orcharde laboured with his owne handes, and trees planted and set by him in a rewe. And Seneca planted plainetrees, made pondes with his owne hande, he turned waters, neither was he more willinge in any other place then in the fieldes. Here of came the surnames of those noble families, of the Fabh, witte, of the multitude of these pulses. Tauri, the Pomponij, the Vituli, the Vitellij, the Percij,  179 pusturinge of cattall. Romulus and Reimus, builders of the Romaine Citie, where shepherdes, and Diodesiane from emonge heardmen was called to be Emperour. Spartacus was a pastoure which caused the Romain power to quake, Paris, and Anchises father to Eneas, and the faire Endimion loued of the moue wereshe pheardes. Polyphemus also and Argus of Admetus Kinge of Thessalia, and Mercurie the inuentoure of the the shepherdes God, and Protheus a shepherde, and a God. And to speake of the Patriarkes, of the Iudges, and of some Kinges of the Hebrewes they were the chiefest men emonge them, and most acceptable shepherdes vnto God, as iuste Abel, Abraham father of many nations, and Iacob father of the chosen people. In like maner Moses the law maker and familiar Prophete with God, and King Dauid chosen according to the mind of the Lorde, and also emong the auucient Greekes euery noble man was a shepheard. Hereof they called some Polyarnee, some Polymelee, some Polybutee, that is to wit, giuing them names of the multitude of Lambes, Sheepe, 180 Calues, which the auncient Greekes termed Italie, moreouer were not the one and the other Bosphorus, Cimmerius and Thracius the sea Egeum, Argos, & Hyppion so called of the passage of Oxen, of Goates, of Horses? And Numidia a countrie of Affrike hathe his name of pastures. The first life of men on earth after the fall of Adam, was of shepherdes, this giueth vnto vs beside diuers kindes of fleash, milke, cheese, butter, to eate: and for apparaile, woll, skinnes, and hides, al doubtlesse as well very necessary, as also profitable to mannes life: which were graunted to man, but after fall, whereas before God had commaunded him in Paradise to cate the fruites alone, whiche the earth naturally brought foorthe. study of fishinge was in time past emonge the Romaines in so greate price, and estimation that they did sow in the Italian sea, as it were corne in the ground, strage fishes, & not knowne in ye sea coste of Italie, brought in shippes from farre cuntries, supposing that there was in them a great commoditie to the common wealth. Furthermore with greate coastes they made fishe pooles and pondes ful of most pretious fishes, of which finally many Princes and families of Rome tooke theire surnames: as the Licinij, the Murenee, the Sergij, the Oratee. For this cause Cicero called Lucius Philippus, & Hortensius nourishers of fishe, that is to witte of their pondes. Wee reade also that the Emperour Octauiane Augustus was wonte to angle for fishe: and Suetonius writeth that Nero fished with a net of golde hauinge the meashes knit with silke of purple and scarlet coloure. There are not verye many kindes of fishinge for all the fishe that is to be founde is taken with nettes, with the hooke, with the weele, with darts, with the rake, and with past. But fishinge is lesse commended, because fish is of a harde nourishment, & vnholsome for the body, nor offerred in the sacrifices of the 182 Pagane Goddes. For there is noman whiche euer harde that fishe was Sacrificed. Hunting and Fowling, do consiste of suche diuises, as fishinge doth: putting moreouer the strength of the body thereto, and diligente searche, and diuers deuises of Snares, Ginnes, and Trappes: vsinge also Birdlime, Egles, Hawkes, Dogges, Greihowndes, and many other tame beastes, meete for rauine and hunting. A detestable Arte, no doubte, a vaine studie, an vnhappie strife, with so many labours, and watches to fighte, & exercise tyranny againste beastes, from nighte to night. A cruell Arte, and altogeather tragicall, whose pleasure is in deathe, and bloude, whiche oure humanitie ought to eschewe. This Arte at the beginning of the worlde, was 183 the chiefest exercise of moste wicked menne and sinners, for the holy. Scripture declareth that Caine, Lamech, Nimbrot, Ismael, and Esawe wee reade in the old Testament, that none exercised huntinge, but the Ismaelites, the Idumeans, & Nations, which 184 knowe not God. Huntinge was the beginninge of Tyrannye, because it findeth no Authoure more meete then him, whiche hathe learned to dispise God, and nature, in the slaughter and boocherie of wilde beastes, and in the spillinge of bloude. Notwithstandinge, the Pepsiane Kinges had this in estimation, as the very study of martial prowesse, bicause Huting, hath in it, a certaine warlike and cruell thinge, whilest that the wilde beaste, renninge before the Greedie Howndes with spilte bloud, & mangled fleshe, doth delite the folowers of the chace, and with greate pleasure, doth beholde a moste bitter deathe, as it were a pastime: and in the meane season, the cruell Hunter laugheth, and accompanied with a greate route, as it were one that triumphed, bringeth home the vnhappy praye, pulled downe to the grounde with a greate crie of howndes, or caught in a Snare: where the theer is ordained a cruel quartering, with a solemne Chyronomie, or had law & prescript woordes: (neither is it lawful to do otherwise) the beaste is rente in peeces, a notable foly of Hunters doubtlesse, and a worthy battaile, about which, whilest they are too busie, they, settinge all humanitie apart, become saluage beastes, and through monstruous naughtinesse of nature, are channged like Acteon into the nature of Beasts. And also, very many of them, haue runne into so greate madnesse, that they became enimies to nature, as the Fables of Dardanus do declare. The 185 Thebanes are sayde to haue benne the inuentoures of so vnhappye a knowledge, a Nation notable for deceipte, robberies, and periuries, discommended for murderinge theire parentes, and for dishoneste companie with their kinsfolke, from whome the rules of that exercise were sente to the Phrygians, a Nation no lesse vncleane in liuinge, then they, but more foolishe, and vaine, whiche, for that cause, the Athenians, and Lacedemonians, very lawe, which forbad Hunting, and openly allowinge the Arte with the exercise, had brought it into their publike wealth, then Athens was firste taken. For this cause, I marueile that Hantinge is commended of 186 Plato, the Prince of Philosophers, excepte perhaps, that he commended it for the ende, or for the necessitie or honestie of the enterprise, not for the pleasure: as Meleager slew the Boare which spoiled Calidonia, not for his pleasure, but for the profit of the common wealth, deliuering his cauntrie of a beaste, that destroyed it. And Romulus chased the Harte, not for pleasures sake, but for necesittie to feede himselfe, and his companions. There is also an other exercise of Hunting, which is termed Fowling, or Birding, of lesse crueltee, but not of lesse vanitee. Herof Fowlers take their name, which truely doo either hunte birdes, or by meanes of birdes (as the Prophete Baruch saithe) doo plaie with the birdes of the heauen. It is said, that Vlysses was the inuentour thereof, whome men reporte 187 the praye, and taught to Hunte, to the end that they might be comfortes of new pleasure to the, whiche felte the losse of theire parentes, in the Troiane exercise. At the length, these exercises (of themselues seruile and base) were so much esteemed, that settinge aside all liberall studies, be at this daye the first beginninges and proceedinges of Nabilitee, and be the meanes of the, men aspire to the highest degree of Nobilitee: & in our time, the life of Kinges & Princes, & (which is more to be lamented) the Religio of Abbots, Bishope, and other Prelates of the Churche, is nothinge els but Huntinge: wherein they doo chiesty eccupie themselues, & sheme their worthines. VVith dastard beastes their mindes are not content,  188 but they make vowes Some fomie Boarc to finde, or Lyon rampinge reade to rowse. And they, whiche ought to be the examples of patience, doo seeke daily, to haue some thinge to conquere, & hunte. And suche beastes as are free by nature, accordinge to the lawe be theirs which take them, the tyrannies of the Nobles haue vsurped them with dreadfull manacinges: the husbandmen are driuen from their fermes: the countrie men are put out of theire tenementes: the heardmen are shut out of the woodes, and meadowes, & the pastures may be stoared with Ueneson, to feede & delite noble me, who are allowed to eate it: wherof, if any countrie man, or husbandman doth tast, he is accused of treason against the Kinge, and is made a praye to the Hunter, togeather with ye beastes. Let vs diligently reade the things which are writen, aswell in the holy Scriptures, as also in the Histories of the Gentiles, where it is not mentioned, that any holy man, any wise man, or any Philosopher, hathe at any time bene a Hunter: but very many Shepheardes, and some, Fishers. And Augustine saithe, that this is the wurste Arte of all other: and the counsailes of Elibitane and Orleaunce, haue forbidden and condemned this in the Cleregie: and in the Canon lawes, Hunters are not onely forbidden the aduauncemet to holy orders, but also are disgraded of ye highest priesthoode, which they haue receiued. In the same it is reade, that Esawe was a Hunter, bicause he was a Sinner. Neither doth the holy Scripture, any where take this woorde huntinge, in good part, wherefore none ought to doubt but that hunting is wicked, which is reiected & condened, by ye multitude of al holy & wise me. In olde time also, when men liued in innocencie, no liuing creaturs flew from them, none hated them, none hurted them: but al beinge subiecte to him did obaie: the examples wherof are also manifest in the latter times, in them which did leade an vpright life: how they ouercame the assaultes of wilde beastes, as Daniel of the Lions, Paule the Apostle of ye Uiper. A crowe nowrished the prophete Helias: Paule and Anthonie Hermites, and a Harte brought Giles meate: Helenus the Abbot commaunded a wilde Asse, and the beaste obaied him, and caried the holy mans burden, he also commaunded a Crocodile, and he caried him ouer a riuer. Many Hermites dwelled in desertes, and stoode in the dennes and caues of wilde beastes, not fearinge Lions, Beares, nor Serpentes. And so, togeather with sinne, the anoyaunce, the persecution, and the flighte of liuinge creatures entred in, and the Artes of Huntinge were deuised. For as Augustine saith, vpon the thirde of Genesis, liuing creatures at the beginninge were not venemous, vnfriendly, and hurtfull to mankinde: but after sinne they became noysome and vnfriendly, whiche came to passe accordinge to Goddes iudgement for a punishment of vniust rebellion of the first parentes, as the sentence was geuen by God to the Serpente, when God saide to him: I will set hatred betweene thee & the woman, and betweene thy seede and her seede, of this sentence the battaile of huntinge tooke his beginning, to weete, of men with other liuinge creatures. Archelaus, kinges, haue writen of these Artes already mentioned, of Husbandrie, of Pasturinge, of Fishinge, of Huntinge, and Fowling: Xenophon Plinie, Columella, Virgil, Crescentius, Palladius, & many latter then these. Cicero deemeth nothinge better, nothinge more plentifull, nothing more pleasaunt, nothing more meete for a free borne man then these. Many haue accompted the soueraigne good, and chiefest felicitee in these. For this cause Virgill nameth of Delphos iudged one Aglaus most happie, who labouring a little ferme in Arcadia, neuer went out of it, & so thorowe very little desire, he had very little trouble in his life. But miserable men, whiche reason so deepely of Husbandrie, be ignoraunt that this is the effecte of sinne, and cursinge of the great God. For he castinge man out of the Paradise of pleasure, sente him into the fieldes, sayinge in this wise to the sinner Adam: accursed be the earth in thy woorke, in labours thou shalt eate thereof all the daies of thy life: shee shall bringe thee foorthe thornes and brembles, and thou shalte eate the Hearbes of the fielde, with the sweate of thy browes, thou shalte eate thy breade, vntil thou retourne to the earth from whence thou were taken. But none doo more perceaue this then Husbandmen, and labourers, whiche whilest they doo eare, sowe, harrowe, prune trees, delue, mowe, reape, gather grapes, feede cattaile, sheare sheepe, hunte, and fishe: after many labours this man, hauinge his groundes spoiled with hayle, and tempeste, doth lose his breade, that mans sheepe or oxen die, or be driuen awaie by Souldiers, he loaseth his hunted beast, an other his fishe, and the wife mourneth at home, the children weepe, and all the housholde is well neare dead for hunger, and againe with an vnsure hope they retourne to a doubtfull laboure. Before this curse there needed no artificiall tillinge of the grounde, no pasturinge, no fishinge, no huntinge, no fowlinge, for the earth of her selfe brought foorth all thinges, continually florishinge, aswel in Winter as in Sommer, with sweetenesse of fruites, with pleasantnesse of sente, and with greenenesse of medowes. Finally the earth brought foorth no hurtfull thinge, no herbe pestilent through poyson, no tree vnprofitable thorow barraines, and also the venime of adders, Uipers, and other creepinge wormes was set aparte (as Beda saithe) and man hauinge the soueraintee ouer all liuinge creatures, he layed burdens vpon wilde beastes as vpon Horses and castaile, he commaunded fishes of the sea, and Birdes flewe to him at his beekinge, and assone as man was borne he had the vse and exercise of all his members, and did leade a most happie life without apparaile, without houses, without rosted and sodden meate, and without medicines, for somuch as he had them without labour, as that Poete saithe: The earth to children meate did giue heate, clothe, and grasse a bedde. But the offence of sinne, and the necessitee of death hath made all thinges noysome vnto vs, the earth dothe not now bringe foorth any thinge without our laboures, and paines: and also it breedeth deadly and venemouse things (as it were openly vpbraidinge vs that we liue) neither doo the other Elementes deale more gentlely with vs, the sea ouerwhelmeth many with cruell stormes, and monstruouse beastes swallowe them vp, the aire fighteth against vs with thundringes, lightninges, & tempestes, and the Heauen also dothe conspire to oure destruction with mortalitee of Pestilence. Liuinge creatures also are manifestly our enimies, and man (as the Prouerbe saith) 189 is a woulfe to man, wicked spirites stande rounde about temptinge vs with diuers snares of sinne, to the ende that they maie drawe vs into the darke lodge of punishmentes, to be tormented perpetually with euerlastinge fire and cruell paines. And hereby it is seene that Husbandrie is nothinge els, but a losse of the beste thinges, the inuention of naughtie parsons, and the discommodities of life, with other exercises his adherentes of pasturinge, fishinge, and huntinge, to the ende that we might at least wise for a season auoide, or rather mitigate the barrainesse of the Earth, wante of sustinance, and colde, by the wearinge of skinnes, with whiche mans nature is admonished of the necessitee of death. Husbandrie should haue this no small prayse of our necessitee or calamitee, if it had rested within these limites, and not goinge beside did not teache so many monstruouse forges of plantes, and so many straunge graffinges and transformations of trees. And also did teache to ioigne Horses with Asses, and Woulfes with Dogges, whereof Mules, & Siukes be engendred, and other monstruouse beastes againste the Lawe of nature. And also it hath taught vs to keepe in cages, in pondes, in parkes, and in closes, those liuing thinges to whome nature hath assigned the Heauen, the Sea, and the Earth, therein to be at libertie, and when they are blinde, or lame to fatten them in the stale, likewise it is conuersaunt in Hempe, in Woulle, in skinnes, in Silke, and in the thinges which nature geueth for the apparaylinge of men, of so many weauinges, of so many colours, and suche like Artes inuented for superfluitee & pompe alone, and very often also for the destruction of men. Wherefore Plinie doth complaine of Hempe alone spronge of so small a seede, whiche nowe a plante, and afterwarde a saile with a very little gale of winde dothe sayle hither and thither thorowe out the world, and doth enforce men to be drowned, & deuoured of sea monsters, as if it were a small matter to die on the lande. I passe ouer a thousande decrees and obseruaunces of Husbandmen, shepeherdes, fishers, hunters, and fowlers, not so foolishe and ridiculouse, as superstitiouse, and contrarie to the lawe of God: wherby thei supposed that they were able to swage tempestes, to make their corne prosper, to driue awaie all noysome thinges, to chase Wolfes and wilde beastes, to staie beastes that renne awaie, to catche fishes and birdes with the handes, and to charme the diseases of their cattaile, of whiche thinges those wise men which I haue before named, haue written with great credulitee, and diligence. But now let vs passe from Husbandmen to Souldiers, whiche chosen out of the fieldes, be more meete for the battaile, as Vegetius saithe: of whome Cato also affirmeth that very valiaunt & worthy souldiers are begotten. And as the holy Scriptures testifie, the firste fighter Caine was a Husbandman and a Hunter. And Ianus and Saturne very warrelike and Auncient Goddes did leade this life togeather with Husbandrie on earth. Wherefore the Arte of Warre seemeth not to be dispised, which as Valcrius saithe, wonne the Seigniorie of Italie to the Romane Empire, and gaue to it the Kingdome of many Cities, of great Kinges, and of most woorthie Nations, it opened the straictes of Pontus, and the creekes of the Sea, it broke open the enclosures of the Alpes, & the Mountaine Taurus. Scipio Africanus doth boste in Ennius, that he opened the waie to Heauen with bloude and slaughter of enimies. To whome Cicero dothe also agree, sayinge: that Hercules by the same waie ascended into Heauen. The Lacedemonians are saide to haue taught this firste: for this cause Hannibal goynge into Italie, sought a Lacedemonian Capitaine of warre. When this is guide and Capitaine, kingdomes & Empires be made, and when this is neglected, the mightiest are brought to vtter ruine. For warrelike Numance, sumptuouse Corinth, stately Thebes, learned Athens, holy Ierusalem, and Carthage, whiche endeuoured to be superiour to the Romaine Empire, at length also Rome, the mightiest of all, fell in the handes of rashe Capitaines. This Arte writen with very muche bloude of mankinde, and with muche more then were the lawes of Draco, dothe trimly 190 teache to appointe the order of battaile, to set the fronte in good araie, to inuade the enimie, to prease on him, to pursue him, to compasse him, to strike him on the righte side, and on the lefte, to fight vnder the Capitaines Ensigne, to marche forwarde, to abide the brunte, to resiste the enimies, straightly to pursue them that flee, to cope blowes, to auoyde them that be geuen, or to warde them with the buckler, and not to passe for them, to assayle the enimie fiercely, to encourage the horse, to spurre him, to staie him with the bridle, to turne him hither and thither, to throwe dartes, to brandishe speares, to whirle Iauelines, to inuade the fronte, the backe, and side of the enimies accordinge to time & place, neither to flee but when the victorie is paste hope: to ensue them that flee, to kill them, to take them, to vnarme them, to spoile them, to discomfite them, to saue their souldiers, to muster them, and renewe the armie, and when victorie is paste hope, to inflame the minde with hope of reuengment, & other duties whiche belonge to Souldiers. It teacheth also to prepare Nauies, to builde Fortresses, to fortifie Castels, to place Garrisons, to make Trenches, to builde Conterniures, to caste ditches, to vndermine, to woorke ingins, to cull out weapons, to ransacke walles, to carrie prouision, to imagine deceipte, to place ambushes, & to knowe how to vse sundry warrelike pollicies. Further more to beseege Cities, to hurle dartes, to shoote of ordinauce, to set Ingins to the walles and pearce them thorowe, to batter Towers, to scale the walles, to prepare fire, to rase fortresses flatte to the grounde, to spoyle Churches, to sacke Cities, to destroie Townes, to waste fieldes, to suppresse lawes, to commit aduoutrie with Matrons, to corrupt widowes, to deflower maidens, to hurte some Citizens, to imprison some, to bannishe some, to slea some cruelly. Finally all this discipline is occupied in nothing els, but in the destruction of men, it seeketh for this ende, to make famouse spoilers of the worlde, and sturdie Homicides, and to transforme men into the manners & facions of sauage beastes. Wherefore warre is nothinge els but a common slaughter and spoile of many, & Souldiers are nothinge els, then hired theeues, and armed to the destruction of the publike weale. Moreouer whereas the endes of battayle be doubtfull, and fortune (not Arte) geueth the victorie, what doo warlike pollicies, ambushes, and other preceptes of the Arte of warre auaile, is not euery Arte vaine, where fortune ruleth? And neuerthelesse the diuine Plato praised this Arte, and commaundeth that children shoulde learne it, and assone as they be of full growinge to be made Souldiers. And the renowmed Kinge Cyrus saide, that it was as necessarie as Husbandrie. And Augustine and Barnarde, Catholike 191 Doctours of the Church, in a certaine place haue approued this, and the Popes decrees doo not disalow it, albeit Christe, and the Apostles, be of a contrarie opinion. Notwithstandinge although Christe disaloweth this, it hathe no base degree of honour in the Churche, whilest there haue risen so many sectes & orders of holy knightes, al whose Religion consisteth in bloude, murders, robberies, and piracie, vnder the pretence to defende, and encrease the faithe: as if Christe would haue his Gospel publishe, dnot with the preachinge of the woorde, but with weapons: not with the confession of the harte, and Martirdome, but with ostentation and threatninge of weapons, with force of armes, slaughters and murders of men. Neither these knightes be not contente to warre against the Turkes, Sarracens, and Panimes, excepte they doo also bringe Nauies for Christians against Christians. Finally battaile and warre doo make many Bishoppes, and oftentimes they fight for the Papacie, and (as that holy Bishop of Camota saithe) the Pope entred not into Sancta Sanctorum, without the bloud of Freers: and this is then called the constauncie of Martirdome, when men fight valiauntly for the Papacie with a great slaughter of Christians. Xenophon, Xenocrates, Onozander, Cato Censorius, Cornelius Celsus, Iginius, Vegetius,  192 Frontinus, Helianus, Modestus and many auncient Authors haue writen of the Arte of warre: of them of not so perilouse as the practisers. Batchelourship, Mastership, & Doctourship, be not the titles, dignities, and degrees of Scholers, neither doo they onely belong to the, which be called Emperours, Dukes, Earles, Marqueses, Knightes, Capitaines, Centurians, Decanes, Standarde bearers, and suche like names of nobilitee sprong of ambition, or iniurie, but theeues, spoilers, pillers, murderers, robbers, sacrilegers, fencers, deflourers, bawdes, whoorehunters, adulterers, traytours, stealers of treasure and cattal, dicers, blasphemours, poysoners, parracides, burners, pirates, tirautes and suche like. All whiche he that will expresse in one woorde, let him terme them Souldiers, that is to saie, in very deede the barbarouse dregges of wicked men, whom a naughtie will, and naughtie minde, stirreth to all mischiefe: emonge whome a freedome to offende and robbe hath the name of dignitee, and libertee, seekinge on euery side to hurte, and hatinge innocencie as a certaine image of death, and as it were be al one bodie of their father the Deuill, whose members they are, whereof Iob saithe: his bodie is like Tergates caste in a moulde, & compacte with scales touching one an other, one is ioygned to an other, & the winde entreth not thorowe them: & so cleauinge togeather they shall not be seperated: they holde togeather, because they haue assembled them selues againste the Lorde, & against his Christe. Purple, Chaines, Ringes, and Miters be not the takens of warre, but woundes in the breastes, and bodies disfigured with scarres. An exercise ioygned with nothinge els but with the death, and griefe of very many men, the destruction of manners, lawes, and godlines, differing altogeather from Christ, from blessednesse, from peace, from charitee, from innocencie, & from patience. The rewardes therof, are glorie of nobilitee, wonne with the sheading of mans bloude, & enlarginge of Empire with desire of rule, and possession, with the euerlastinge damnation of many soules. For whereas victorie is the ende of al warre, noman can be a conqueroure, except he be a manslayer: contrarywise none can be conquered except he dye amisse. Wherefore ye death of souldiers is most wicked, whileste sinne maketh them a naughty Etitaphe. They which kil, be vniuste, albeit the warre be righteouse. For murderers be not for this cruell towardes them, whome they wickedly murder, but because they haue serued in warres for the loue of gaine and bootye. And if they kill any menne rightfully, they whiche haue slaine them, placinge themselues in the order of executioners haue deserued this degree of Nobilitee: and although the lawes doo seuerily punishe theeues, setters of Houses, and Cities on fiere, robbers, homicides, murderers, suche parsons vnder the pretence of goinge a warfarre be reckened noble and honorable. Nobilitee then taketh his beginning of warrefarre, that is to saye, honor of birthe worthely goten by the bloude and death of enimies, approued with the peoples rewarde, and aduaunced with publike badges of honours. For this cause arose emonge the Romaines so many fortes of ciuill, mural, obsidional, & naual garlads, so many warrefaringe giftes, bracelets, launces, bardes, chaines, ringes, images, and pictures, wherewith they commended the firste beginninges of nobilitie. Emonge the Carthaginensians thei had so many ringes giuen the, as they had ben present at battails. The Spaniardes raised 193 enimies. Emong the Scytheans thei onely might drinke at a common banket in a broade bol of siluer & golde, ye was carried about, which had slaine an enimie. The Macedonians had a lawe, that they whiche had not 194 of vnnoblenes. Emonge the people of Germanie none coulde marry a wife, that had not firste brought to the Kinge the heade of a slaine enimie, and this indignation of dewe honour not giuen to them which had fought valiauntly, induced many against theire countrie, to subuerte the libertie thereof. Coriolane, the Gracchi, Scylla, Marius, Sertorius, Catiline, & C aesar be an example hereof. If then wee searche the Originall of Nobilitie, wee shall finde that it is won with shameful treason and crueltie, if we behold ye entrie therof, we shal find it to be augmeted with hired seruice in warfarre, and with robberies, and also if wee seeke the Originall of Kingedomes, and Empires, wicked murderinge of brothers and parentes, blouddy mariages, and fathers driuen out of the kingedome by theire sonnes, or Princes slaine by them to who thei haue ben sworne subiectes wil offer themselues. But let vs a little consider nobilitee from his beginninge. To tell the truthe it is nothinge els but a sturddye, lewdnesse, and woorshippe wonne with wickednesse the blessinge, and enheritaunce of the wurste children. The holy Scriptures, and aunciente & fresh Histories of countries doo giue vs to vnderstande that it is true. For whereas from the beginninge of the creation of the worlde the transgressoure Adam had engendred his firste begoten Caine a husbandman, and an other Abel a shephearde, in whome mans familie made two wayes, that is to witte, in Abel of the Commons, & in Caine of the Nobles, who whereas he was prowde and cruel according to the flesh, persecutinge him after his manner, slewe Abel, who was humble accordinge to the Spirite: but the familie of the Comons was renewed in Seth the third sonne of Adam,  195 Caine therefore was the first that by the slaughter of his brother gaue the beginninge to warfarre and Nobilitee, and when he had dispised the, lawes of God, and nature trusting in his owne strength, taking rule in hand was the firste that builte cities, ordayned Empire, and began to oppresse free men created of God, and the childerne of holy generatio, with force, rauine, bondage, and with the lawes of iniquitie, vntil that they also despisinge the iudgemente of God, and corrupting all fleshe, and defiled with confused luste begot Giantes, which the holy Scripture interpreteth great and famous men of the worlde. And this is the true & aptest definitio of Noble men. For they did oppresse the poore, exalting themselues with robberies, waringe prowde thorowe riches, makinge theire names renowned, giuinge them to Countries, Cities, Mountaines, Riuers, Waters, and to the sea, whose first father was Caine cruell by nature, enuious thorow mortall hatred, not amended by Godes correction, a traitour thorowe priuie wrath, a murderer of his owne bloude, a wanderer & vagabond thorow malediction, adding moreouer blasphemie to maledictio. And these are ye aucientest & first dignities, these be & vertues, these be the practises, wherewith Nobllitee is commended and set foorthe, the principall woorker whereof was that father of Giantes, which the Lord destroyed in the great flowde of waters, reseruing Noe alone, a righteous man in the generatios of Seth, with his familie, where as he had three childerne Sem, Cham, and Iaphet, they when the worlde was renewed after the Deluge, did also builde Cities like the ancient Giantes, and appointed kingdomes: For this cause the Scripture maketh no mention of righteouse men fro No e euen vnto Abraham. For all euen vntill Abraham, were Artificers of Nobilitee, that is to witte, of valiante wickednes, of impietee, of confusion, of power, of warre, of violence, of oppression, of huntinge, of luxuriousnesse, of pompe, of vanitee, and of such like marks of Nobilitee, which ye sonnes of No e did set vpo it: in the number of wt Cham, because he was more wicked then the rest, & cruel towardes his father deserued to haue the first Monarchie Empresse of al kingdomes. He begot Nimbroth, whom ye Scripture describeth mighty in earth, and a sturdy Hunter 196 confusion of tongues, and taught ye discipline to rule, and did put difference betwene degrees of Nobilitees, honours, dignitees, offices, & armes. From thence foorthe lawes were made against the Commons, bondage & exactions from the people were brought in, armies gathered, and cruel warres made. From the same Cham proceeded Chus, of whom came the Ethiopians, and Mizraim of whom the Egyptians toke theire beginning, and Canaan, outcastes, and accursed of God. At the laste after a longe time paste, God did chose againe a righteous man, Abraham the Partriarke, of whome he raised to him a seede and holy people, whom he made to differ from the multitude of other Nations with the marke of circumcision. This man at the beginning begat twoo sonnes, one of a woman seruant, which was a bastrade called Ismael, became a cruel ma, an archer, a noble man, and a puissaunt Prince, leauinge his name perpetually to the Nation of the Ismaelites: and God blessed him, & established his Nobilitee in robberye, and warfarre, sayinge: his handes shalbe againste al me, and al mens hands shalbe against him, and he shal plant his tentes ouer againste his brethren, But Isaac abyding in the iustice of his father, fedde his fathers flocke, & this man begat of Rebecca his wife ij. sonnes Esau, and Iacob. Esau therfore was hated of God, redde coloured, hairy, a hunter, an Archer, a Glutton, and giuen to the bellie, so much ye for a mease of potage he soulde his right, he was made a mightie man, and Prince of the Idumeans: receiuinge the blessing of nobilitie in the fatnesse of the earth, and dewe of heauen, in the sworde, and puttinge awaye of bondage. But iuste Iacob fleinge to Laban his Uncle, fedde his sheepe, whose twoo daughters, when for the seruitude of xiiij. yeares he had deserued to marrie, he begot lefte to his posteritie, that it should be called the people of Israell. Iacob (as I haue saide) had twelue sonnes, to wit, Ruben, Simeon, Leui, Iudas, Isachar, Zabulon, Ioseph, Beniamin, Dan, Nepthtalim, Gad, & Asar, Ioseph, solde by his brethern into Egypt, was instructed in all the learninge of the Egyptians, and became a very conninge interpretoure of dreames, and diuined in a cuppe, he was so skilfull in the science of houskeepinge, that he by the subtiltee of his wit, inuented newe Artes to get riches, and to encrease reuenewe, for which cause, he beinge very acceptable to ye King Pharao, was by him made ruler ouer all Egypt, and of a seruant was created a noble man after the solemne maner of the Egyptians. For the King put a Ringe on his finger, and a chaine of gold about his necke, and clad him in purple, & caused him to mounte into a chariote, a cryer makinge proclamation, ye euery man should afterwarde reuerence him, as a noble man, and a Prince. The like manner of ennoblinge in al pointes was emonge the Perseans, as it is reade in the boke of Hester, of Mardocheus ye Hebrewe, auaunced by Kinge Artaxarxes. From thence vntill this day this custome of creating noble men hath remained emonge Kinges and Emperours, of whom some buy Nobilitee for monye, some haue deserued it for bawdrie, some for poisoning, some for murders. Treason also hath purchased vnto many nobilitee, & hath goten them riches, as it is writen in ye Histories of Euthicrates, Phylocrates, Euphorba, & Philagrus. Many haue ben ennobled for flattery, solaunderinge, false accusation, and deceit: More for sufferinge Kinges to take pleasure of theire wiues and daughters, haue ben made noble, huntinges, robberies, murders, inchauntments and other naughty Artes haue brought many to promotio. But let vs returne to Ioseph. Whereas he was mightie in the Kinges house, and had nobilitie in reproche and despite of his fathers house, sayde these woordes not without offence: God hath made mee to forget my labours, & the house of my father, wherefore Ephraim the youngeste sonne was preferred before Manasses in blessinges. Finally Ioseph, albeit he was the sonne of Iacob, yet for this estate of nobilitie hated of God, deserued not to beare the name of the Tribe in Israel, but was geuen to Ephraim and Manasse his sonnes. And they had no Prophete in theire Tribes, and were blessed with the lest blessing of all, that is to witte, in the strength and multitude of their familie. The people of Israel dwelt many yeares in Egypt, and they were sheepheardes in the lande of Gessen, but when they grew to a greate and mighty Nation, they became suspiciouse and hatefull to the Nobles and Kinges of Egypt: wherfore they punished them with harde labours of claie and bricke, & in al seruage of labours of the earth, & slew their male childerne, drowning the in riuers, that there might remaine none of theire seede on the earthe. Then one of these, because he was a goodly childe, was saued by the Kinges daughter, who made him her sonne by adoption, and called him Moses, bicause shee had saued him from drowning. Moses tha wared bigger in the Kings house, & beinge instructed in al the learninge of the Egyptians, & helde for the Kings sonne, was made mighty, and Capitaine of Pharoes armie against ye Ethiopians. He tooke the Kinges daughter of Ethiopia, whereupon when he had purchased the enuie & hatred of ye Egyptians, he was constrayned to flee into Madian, where at a certaine well, he enterprising warre against the shepherdes of that countrie for certaine maidens, by that meanes he gotte one of them for his wife daughter of a Priest, at the length growinge in age and wisdome, acknowledging his stocke of the nation of the Hebrewes retourned into Egypt and ye Egyptian Nobilitee renounced, he conforted by God was brought them out of Egypte, and when the people had offended againste God in the golden Calfe, Moses beinge displeased tooke to him valiaunte menne the sonnes of Leui, and commaunded them, sayeinge: Hange your swordes by your side, and goinge foorth and backe, kill eache of you his brother, his friende and his neighboures, and when they had committed this slaughter of about xxiij. thousande men, he blessed them, saying: ye haue to daye hallowed your handes in bloude euerye one of you in his sonne and in his brother, & the blessinge of Iacob, Simeon, and Leui, whiche called them the fightinge vessels of iniquitee, is fulfilled: whose furie is accursed, and obstinate, and indignation cruell. Wherfore the Nobilitee of Israel tooke his beginning in this notable murder: for Moses did then appoint them Princes, Capitains, heades of the armie, Tribunes, Centurians, Quinquagenarians, and kinredes: of which he that seemed to surpasse others in woorthinesse and vanesse, to him they attributed the soueraintee and authoritee to iudge. For they had no Kinge, but they were ruled by iudges, of which Iosua a noble ma, a stout, and a warlike conqueroure of Kinges, and fearinge no man, after Moses was the soueraigne, after whose decease thei liued without Prince, vnder Democratia, that is to witte, the gouernance of the people, but falling at sedition, fought emonge themselues, and well neere destroyed the Tribe of Beniamin, that there remained, but sixe hundreth me. And bicause they had wrongfully take away thei daughters, they gaue them iiij. hundreth Uirgins of the prisoners of Iahis Galaad: to the other two hundreth thei gaue leaue to take awaye by force ye Uirgins of Silo. And after this maner was the blessinge of ye Nobilitee of Beniamin fulfilled, like to a Woulfe, which in ye mourning getteth his praye, and in the eueninge deuideth the spoile. Afterwarde whom at the length Abimelech, the bastarde sonne of Hieroboal, of the Tribe of Manasse, after that they had with a solemne slaughter killed vpon a stoane three scoare of his lawfully begotten bretherne, was the firste that did beare rule in Sichem. After this when the people of Israel demaunded a Kinge, in the displeasure of the Lorde, they had Kinges geuen them very few good, and many euil. For God was angry, and tolde them, the authoritee of the King, which might take away their sonnes and daughters, makinge them Carters, and Bakers, and accordinge to his pleasure, he mighte take tenthes, and diuide emong his seruaunts, fieldes, flockes, fermes, & men and women seruants, and the best things that they had, and might oppresse all the people with the yoke of bondage, and as often as the Kinge shall offende, and do amisse, the people shoulde be punished for him. He appointed them a younge man of the Tribe of Beniamin called Saul, to be their King, a mighty man of body, tawle of stature, in so much that he was higher the al the people by the heade and shoulders, & God made them al afrayde, so that they reuerenced him as the Lordes seruaunte. This man, before he began to take rule in hand, was innocent as a childe of twelue monethes olde, and of a passing towardnes, but after that he had gote ye Nobilitee of the Realme, he became a wicked man, and the sonne of Belial. Wherefore God tooke awaye the Kingedome from the house of Saul, and gaue it to Dauid sonne of Isai infected with the same pestilence of Nobilitee, became the man of sinne, a sacrileger, an adulterer, & a maslayer, notwithstanding God withdrewe not his mercie from him. At the beginning he raygned in Hebron when Hisboseth kingdome of al the people was assured to him in Hierusalem. Yet notwithstanding he helde not his sonne Absolon inuaded ye kingdome in Hebron, and whe he was slaine, Siba the sonne of Bochra, inuaded the kingdome a freshe. After this in like maner Adonias sought meanes, & endeuoured with all study to attaine to ye kingdome. But Dauid, beinge aboute to die, appointed Salomon his yongest sonne, begotten on Bethsabe ye adultresse to be his heire, & he was the first ye had ye Monarchie of the Hebrewes, which he established with the death of Adonias his eldest brother, & likewise after he was made Kinge, he wente out of the right waie after women into Fornications, and Idolatrie, forsaking the lawe of God, & his naughtie sonne Roboam succeded him in the state, a wicked man also, and a sinner against God: and therfore the Monarchie of the people was taken from him, & ten tribes rebelled againste him: and made Hieroboam their Kinge, a most wicked man, of the Tribe of Dan, who poisoned all Israel, withdrawinge ten Tribes from God to Idolatrie, erectinge Calues in Samaria, that the blessinge might be fulfilled: saying, Dan is a Serpent in the waie, and a Dragon in the pathe bitinge the Horse heele, that his rider maie fall backewarde. But the Tribe of Iuda rested vnder the seede of Dauid, Iudas, vntill Messias came. This Iudas was the wurste of the sonnes of Iacob, and had dishonestly behaued him selfe with his sonnes wife, and his children were moste wicked and naught: wherefore he had the blessinge of nobilitee in the Scepter of his kingdome,  & in the strength of the Lion: at the length also the people of Edom and Lobne, departed from the Kinges of Israel, and created Kinges accordinge to their wil and pleasure, as God blessed Esau, that he, as he lifted might shake of his yoke. But emonge all the Kinges of Iuda and Israel, scantly fower haue benne founde good. Wherfore when the Kinges were expulsed, the Iewes with all the nobilitee were carried prysoners the mercy of God retourned to Hierusalem and happely gouerned their common weale for a certain space vnder Priestes, Noble men, and populare Magistrates, vntil Aristobolus, Hircanus sonne, crowned him selfe kinge, and with the slaughter of his Mother & Brethren restored the kingdome of the Iewes, whiche afterwarde continuynge by many Kinges, lastly ended vnder Archelaus a prowde, & dishonest kinge, when Iudea was made a prouince of the Romaines, & at length destroyed vnder Titus and Vespasiane, all the people beinge scattered abroade thorowe out all the worlde vntill this daie for a perpetuall bondage. Wherefore I thought good to take these thinges out of the holy Scripture, to shew that since the beginning of the world there hath bene no Nobilitee, which hath not had a naughtie beginninge, yea in the people of God, and that nobilitee to be nothinge els, but the glorie and rewarde of publike iniquitee: wherein the more the life is distained, the nobler it is, the more mischieuous actes, the more rewarde and glorie: as Diomedes the pirate preately saide to Alexander when he 197 was taken: I, because I robbe with one shippe alone, am accused for a pirate: thou, because thou doest it with a great nauie, art called an Emperour: if thou were alone, and a prisoner, thou shouldest be a theefe, if the people obayed me at a becke, I shoulde be called an Emperour: For as touchinge the cause we differre not, sauinge that he is warste, that taketh more wickedly, that forsaketh iustice more contemptuously, and that resisteth the lawes more manifestly. For them, whiche I flee, thou pursuest: them which I honour, as I maie, thou dispisest, the crueltee of fortune, and pouertie maketh me a theefe, and thee, intollerable pride and vnsatiable greedinesse. If my fortune would waxe more fauourable, perhappes I shold become better: but, the more fortunate thou shalte be, the wickeder thou wilte be. Alexander marueilinge at the constauncie of the man, he caused him to be bilde for a Souldier, that afterwarde he mighte goo on warrefare, that is, to robbe. Nowe passinge to the Histories of the Gentils, we declare likewise that nobilitee is nothinge els, then rauine, madnesse, robberie, thefte, manslaughter, riote, huntinge, and violence spronge in euery place of moste wicked beginninges, continued by wurse, and alwaies to haue had a very dishonest ende: whiche thinge shall manifestly be seene in these sower famouse Monarchies, and afterwarde also in the raignes of other Noble men. The firste Monarchie after the deluge was that of the Assyrians, which Ninus beganne, who firste of all not contented with his owne limites, through desire to enlarge his Empire, auaunced standerdes out of his Countrie, and makinge blouddie warre vpon the borderers, subdued al the people of the East, and alwaies encreased the greatnesse of his gotte Empire with freshe victories, and continual augmentation of foraine Countries. Asia beinge subdued, & Pontus (as Dion the Historian recompteth) desired her husbande to raigne fiue daies, which thinge graunted and obtained, shee caused the crowne and robe to be made readie, & sate downe in the royall seate, and commaunded the garde to kill 198 that he was in this manner murdered, shee succeaded him in the Empire: and not contented with the boundes of the kingdome, ioygned Ethiopia to her Empire, shee made warre in India, shee compassed Babylon with a stately walle, lastly shee was slaine by Ninus the second, her sonne, whom shee had wickedly coceaued, cruelly caste out to be perished, and incestuously vsed. The Monarchie of the Assyrians gotte the Soueraintee by these murders of parentes and kinsfolke, vntill it failed vnder Kinge Sardanapalus flockes of Harlottes, slewe, and he proclaiminge him selfe kinge, transposed all the Empire from the Assyrians to the Medes, and at the length Cyrus brought it to the Persians, emonge whome, his sonne Cambises the seconde Monarchie, whiche he defiled with the murder of his brother and sonne: finally it fell to Nursus the sonne of Ochus, whome, after he was slaine by Bagous the gelded man, Darius the Persian, sonne of Arsous succeaded, firste called Gademanus, who vanquished by Alexader the Greate, togeather with his life ended the Monarchie of the Persians, whiche, the same Alexander beinge accessarie, and a counsailour of his Fathers death, togeather with his aduoutrous mother by meanes of this famouse murder, broughte to the Macedonians, and this was the thirde Monarchie, which also failed when Alexander was dead. The fourth succeaded whiche was the Monarchie of the Romains, then the which, there was none mightier in the worlde, but if we beholde the processe of times since the buildinge of Rome, we shall finde that it had his original of wicked beginninges, & very often continued by wicked men, wherefore we will fetch these thinges farre, and from the firste builders of Rome. The Citie of Rome was firste builded in Italie by twoo brothers, Remus and Romulus, begotten of an incestuouse Vestal Caine, defiled with the death of his brother. And for so much as he suffered him selfe to be called the sonne of the Gods, gatheringe a power of wicked attendauntes and promisinge them suretie, rauished the doughters of the Sabines, and geuinge them to wiues suche as they did choose, begatte Giauntes, I meane, those Kinges and Barons of the Romane nobilitee, feared of all the worlde. And than when they had with deceiptfull league, & trayterouse rauished, and with cruell mariages coupled to him, and his, and gotten with the slaughter of their parentes, & husbandes did after this defende them wt other freshe murders: For notable to refraigne from ye bloude of his Father enlawe, did cruelly murder Titus Tatius, a righteouse old man, and a most noble Capitaine of the Sabines, being partaker with him in his kingdome. These wers ye beginninges of the Romane raigne, which gouerned for the space of two hundreth, fortie and three yeares vnder cruel Kings, and ceased vnder Tarquinius the prowde for the shamefull acte of deflowred Lucrece. vnder the deluge of waters: in like manner also these successours of Romulus were oppressed in the seuenth number of Kinges by the insurrectio of the people: & although the Citie of Rome had abolished the rule of Kinges, neuerthelesse it was not free from tirannie. For after that the kinges were expulsed, when after the great commotion of the people, the kingdome was transposed to the heade men of the Citie, one Brutus a noble man was firste choosen consul of the Romans. This man, to the ende that he might establishe so great an Empire, wente about, not onely to counteruaile in murder kinge Romulus, the firste builder thereof, but to surpasse him also, for somuch as he caused his twoo Sonnes being youge men, and so many of the Vitellij whiche were his wiues brothers, to be whipped with roddes, and to be beheaded in the middle of the market place. And when this Empire had continued a longe time vnder the nobles and commons by diuers Magistrates, & priuate tirannies, it ended vnder Iulius Caesar, a man, it is harde to saie, whether more valiaunt in battaile, or corrupte in Lecherie, and afterward ended eftsoones vnder Antonie the bonde slane of Lecherie, and the whole Empire of the Romanes passed to Octauian Augustus the Emperoure, in him the although this Augustus was accompted the mildest of all other Princes, notwithstandinge he killed a boye & a maide, the children of Caesar his vncle & Cleopatra, by whom he was adopted, and appointed heire in the Empire, hauinge respecte neither to the name, nor to the benefite, nor to the kinred, nor to the childehoode. After this manner the Romane Princes gotte the Monarchie of the worlde, and begate Nero, Domitian, Caligula, Heliogabalus, Galien, and other monsters of crueltie and lewde life, vnder whom the whole worlde trembled: vntill Constantine the Greate, after he had slaine Mezentius, who for his sensualitee and crueltie was hated of the Romane people, was declared Emperour by the Senate. This Constantine, when he repaired Bizance, and made it a Citie, contendinge with Rome for glorie, and for that did commaunde it to be called newe Rome, and of his name Constantinopolis, woulde that it should be the seate of Emperours, and brought the Romane Empire to the Greekes, and did consecrate it at Constantinople, as Romulus did at Rome, with the slaughter of the twoo Licinij, husbande and sonne of his sister, and with the murder of his owne children and wife: and the Empire continued emonge the Greekes vntill the time of Charles the Greate, in whome onely the name of the Empire passed to the Germans. But wee haue hitherto sufficiently spoken of Monarchies. Lette vs consider the beginninges and endes of some other kingdomes, and we shall finde that they had no better beginninges, nor gotten with lesse abominable vices, nor againe vndonne with lesse sensualitee. I will not speake of the murders of Dardanus, & in what manner he being perswaded to commit a mischieuous deede, was the firste Kinge of the Grecians. I will also passe ouer the gouernaunce of women gotten by the murders of men, as the Histories doo recorde of the Amazones. Let vs passe to latter times, and that raigned in Spaigne was Atanaricus the Gothe, but at the same time also the people Alani, & the Vandales possessed Spaigne. Suitilla Spaigne, whiche, lastly kinge Rodericke, because he had defloured Iulia, the Empire of the Gothes to an ende, because the Saracines did than inuade Spaigne: afterward whe certaine places were recouered vnder king Pelagius, than firste they beganne to be called kinges of Spaigne, & nomore of Gothes, the title of the kingdome remaininge in the Citie of Legio, proclaimed him selfe kinge of Castell, and after that he had slaine his brother Garsia, with that murder he gotte also the kingdome of Nauarre. warrelike and fierce man became the firste kinge of Aragon. But Alphonsus was the first king of Portugal, begotten by Henry Lotharing, a man valiaunt in armes, who in one battaile alone ouercame fiue kinges of the Sarasines, for this cause 199 shieldes: not withstandinge this Alphonsus was cruell towardes his mother, whom he caste in perpetuall prison, because shee maried the second time, neither could he be turned with any desires of his friendes, nor with the threatninges of the Churche to set her at libertie. Finally all these kingdomes of Spaigne haue bene gotten with mischieuous actes, or established with the same practises. The beginninges of the kingdome of England be fabulouse: This Ilande was after warde inhabited & subdued ouer all vnder diuers kinges, & of many Nations. of the Pictes, Scottes, Danes, and Saxons. Lastly it gotte a quiete Monarchie vnder William Conquerour, which Confin kinge of the Weste Saxons, whose succession remaineth vntill this daie very famouse, for notable murders. I speake not of the kingdomes of Burgundie, and Lumbardie, first be gon by the farthest people of Germante, in Fraunce, & Italie, on this side by kinge Gondaicke, on the otherside by kinge Alboyne, and afterwarde continued with moste cruell murders. Let vs behold the mightie kingdome of the Frenchmen, his firste beginninges toke originall of Pharamond, sonne of the Capitaine Morouee, who first cominge out of Germanie into Fraunce, was made the firste kinge of the Frenchmen, passing euery man in crueltie and fiercenesse. This kinges liue endured vnto Childericke the thirde, who for negligence in gouerninge the common wealth, & for vnlawful luste towardes Matrones, being driuen out of his kingdome, was enforced to flee into a monaterie of Monkes, Pipine of the elder house succeading him in the kingdome, which he gettinge to him selfe & his posteritee by treason afterwarde, with the murder of his brother Grifo, was poysoned by Blanche his wife for 200 Fraunce, a swashbuckler, a cruell man, and a woorthie warriour, who for these Artes, was much esteemed of the people of Paris, otherwise vnnoble and a Bouchers sonne. This man rebelled against Charles the vncle of Lewes, & the true inheritour of the kingdome, hauing gathered a power of naughty knaues, & an armie of wicked theeues, he caste the saide Charles in pryson at Orleance, who was yelded into his handes, and enforced him there to die, thus when he had committed this murder against the Kinge, & his Prince, he put on ye crowne, and hauing chaunged the Boucherie for a kingdome, he and his posteritee after warde raigned in Fraunce: whose succession continueth euen to this daie, vntil that it come to decaie againe thorowe some slaue of harlottes and Lecherie. It should be ouer longe in this place to recken vp the beginninges of all kingdomes, and to range thorow al the histories of antiquities. I haue els where described in a larger volume, this thinge which I haue here briefly touched, I haue by peece meale set foorth nobilitee in his colours, and proportions, and I haue shewed that there neuer was, nor presently is, any kingdome or greate dominion in the world, which hath not begonne with murder of parentes, treason, disloyaltee, crueltee, slaughter, death, & other horrible mischiefes the very Artes of nobilitee, whereof sith there be such heades, we maie easely perceiue, what other members this beaste hath, and all these readie and exercised to violence, rauine, murder, Huntinge, sensualitee, and to all kinde of dishonestie. He that wilbe Noble, let him firste be a Hunter: this is ye 201 firste beginninge of Nobilitee, afterwarde a hired Souldier, & let him serue an other for monye to commit murders, this is the true vertue of Nobilitee, wherein if he shall shewe himselfe a stronge theefe, there is no greater glory of Nobilitee. He that is vnmeete to do these things, let him buy Nobilitee with mony: for it is solde aswell as other things: or if he cannot doo this, let him be the Kings parasite, or bring himselfe in fauour by some other courtly deceipte, let him be bawde to the Whoores of the Palace, or make his wife or daughters comon to the Prince, or let him fulfil the appetite of Ladies, or marrie ye Kings Concubine, or take to wife their bastard daughters, this is the highest degree of Nobilitee: for he is made one body with them. These be the wayes, these be the ladders, and these be the steppes, with which, thorow a short path men ascende to the highest perfection of Nobilitee. But they that will seeme in theire kinde more Gentlemanlike and Nobleste of all others, auaunt that they are descended of suche men, as euery man woulde dispise, that is, straungers, Troians, and Macedonians, wandringe and fleinge from doubtful countries, and ouerwhelmed with a thousande offences moste haynous, and notwithstanding (on Gods name) we must praise and extol this theire. Nobilitee, which hath had so dishonest beginnings. Some borne of Whoores and Harlottes, doo cloke this shame with fables, as we reade of Melusina. There be of them whiche haue had other wicked beginnings, inceste, deflourings, rauishinges, aduouteries and such like. In this wise Baldouine firste Earle of Flaunders. Likewise ye Marquesses of Piemont, that is to wit, of Mountefarrate, Salutia, Sene, & many other were created by the Emperour Otho, in consideration of one of their daughter, whiche he defloured. For Kinges and Emperoures were wonte sometimes to auaunce their wronges to honoure with some title of dignitee, which they be not able to reuenge without great shame. There are moreouer foure principall pointes, in whiche al theire felicite doth consiste: The firste is their extorcion, wherewith against al right and equitee, they hold, take and possesse: the other is voluptuousnes, wherwith they accustome themselues in all kinde of luxuriousnes and sensualitee: the thirde is liberty, where with the lawes neglected, they enuironed with the force of violence, do al thinges as they liste: the fourthe is ambition, where with they puffed vp doo seeke aboue theire estate and condition, for higher promotion with al kinde of wickednesse. Finally the sufficiencie of all gentlemen is herin declared, if they can hunte, if they haue bene damnably taught in disinge, if they shewe the strength of theire body with greate quaffinge, if they declare the strength of nature by the often vse of Uenerie, if thei spende franckly and luseley, if they geuen to pride, to excesse, and to all intemperancie, and enimies of vertues, doo forget that they were borne and that they shall dye. But they be muche more noble, if this wickednesse shall descende from the Fathers to the childerne, & enter If damned dice the Father doth delite, the galante sonne VVill playe, and make the squared boanes on plained borde to ronne. These be the goodly vertues of Gentleme. But they haue moreouer certaine other Artes of Nobilitee, in the which they beinge warste of all, endeuoure that they maye seeme to be good and honest men, and appeare honourable for their wisdome, liberalitee, godly zeale, and iustice, thei shewe themselues so gentle, pleasaunt, and courteise in language, & notable in the dissimulation of all vertues: they make theire woordes more caulme then oyle, & they be dartes, they dayly make sumptuous bankets: and reason very franckly of the publike wealth in their talke and communication, and geuing eare to other mens opinios, doo therby get them the same of wise and woorthy men in the counsailes of Princes: and doo wrougfully take the same of liberalitee of couetousnes, whilest they be like liberall theeues doo take from one that whiche they geue to an other, which the ancientes write also of Scylla, whilest they goinge about to enriche one with the wronge of an other be alwayes poore themselues, for al their continual robberies. Wherefore they seeke for the name of iustice & goodlines, whilest they willingly take in hand to defende poore mens quarrels, and maintaine their causes against the richer sorte, but they onely helpe these oppressed parsons, vntil they haue empted the wealthy mes powches. Neither doo they minde to profit the poore, but to hurt the riche, whiche is easier for euery of them to doo then to doo good, and oftentimes with this shadowe of righteousnes and godlinesse they claime to themselues so great a libertie, that they doo wronge to Cities, & to the greatest personages, and trouble them with common enmitie: and of whome for the authoritie of the Lawes noman may hope for pardon, these vnder the pretence of Nobilitee haue attained to glory, and no otherwise then ancient, Giaunts doo glory in their offences, and for so much as like deuils of hell they seeke on euery side to doo harme, than they are thought chieflye to doo good, whan onely they cease to doo harme, endeuouringe to feare all men and to be loued of noman, layinge in a parte with all naughty and wicked men, and doo spoile and oppresse such as cammitted themselues to their custody: neither is there any kinde of men more pestilent to Cities then these Nobles, whiche pleasinge themselues doo alwayes swel with a prowde minde as though they were more Gentlemanlike then others. Of wich for this cause Aristophanes hath not cousailed amisse, sayinge, that Lyons ought not to be nourished in a Citie, but if they be brought vp: wee muste doo as they 202 will haue vs. The Swissers in time past being oppressed by these mens Tyrannie slewe theire Nobles, and rooted al theire progenie out of the countrie, with this notable murder of Nobles, they haue gotten a name renowmed for theire prowesse, togeather with libertie, wherin they haue happely ruled & raigned more then foure hundreth yeares vntil this daye, and haue alwayes hated this generatio of Noble men. None were once more acceptable to the people, nor reputed woorthier of greater rewards, then they which had slaine tiraunts, togeather with their complices and maintainers, and also their innocent childerne, 203 moreouer the Lawiers teach that sometimes they which haue not offended may be righteously put to death, if that be auailable to the common wealth, as when atyraunte is slayne, to murder also his childreen, because no newe tyrannye may springe vp: as the Greekes, after the destruction of Troye, remaine no occasion to make warre eftsoones. Let vs peruse the Historiographers of ancient time, Titus Liuius, Iosephus, Egesippus, Quintus Curtius, Suetonius, Tacitus, Serenus, Tranquillus, and the residewe, & we shal finde that it was alwayes leeful to entrappe tyrauntes, that it was leeful to deceiue them, very honest to kil them, and also to poyson them, as Tiberius the thirde Emperoure after Iulrus C aesar was slaine: but albeit poysoning hath euer ben detestable, yet the world deemed that to geue life wher with he was killed. The holy Scriptures doo witnesse the same in Eglon, in Sisara, leefull euen in the presence of God, to shake of the yoke of bondage with the deathe of tyraunts for their misdeedes, and al they by whose prowesse the afflicted people were deliuered, be honoured in the holy Historie of the Bible for the Ministers of God. But now we doubt not that Nobilitee is naught, not so much for vse, & custome, as for nature: for emonge birdes, and fourfooted beastes, none els haue the prerogatiue of Nobilitee, but suche as are not so enuious as hurtfull vnto other liuinge creatures and to men themselues, as Egles, Uultures, Fawcons, Hawkes, Rauens, Bites, Ostriches, the fabulous Harpies, Griffons, Mermaydes, and suche like monsters. In like manner Tigers, Lions, Woulfes, Liberds, Beares, Boares, Dragons, Serpents, & Toades. Of trees there haue ben fewe or none accompted Noble, and dedicated to the Heathen Gods, but they which haue ben either barraine, or bringe foorth no fruite for men to eate, as the Oke, the tree called Esculus, the Beeche, the Baye, the Mirtle, Emonge stoanes not marble, not them wherewith men builde, not them ye grinde corne be accopted ye noblest, but they that be pretious, as Diamondes, Rubies, Pearles, and suche like, and bringe no commoditee vnto men. And so in Mettals, Siluer whiche causeth very much mischiefe, and Gold more hurtful then Iron, be moste esteemed and accompted the beste, for whiche the people fight one with an other with many slaughters and losse of mans bloude. From hence came moreouer that noble Arte and Philosophie of Heraldes, very muche occupied in appointing and geuing the creasts of Noble men: to whom it is an hainous and infamouse thinge to beare in armes 204 any beaste that carieth burdeins, or Calfe, or Sheepe, or Lambe, or Capon, or Hen, or Goose, or any suche beastes or birdes, whiche are necessary to men, for seruice or vse: but al men ought to begin the badges of theire Nobilitee with cruell and greedy beastes. In this wise the Romans chose them the Eagle the greediest of all birdes, the Phrigians the Sowe a hurtful beaste, the Thracians, Mars, the ancient Gothes, the Beare, the people Alani that inuaded Spaigne, the Catte a greedye and craftie beaste: the olde Frenchemen, the Lion, the Saxons also the same: but afterwarde the Frenchemen that inhabited Fraunce tooke the Toodes, the Saxons, the Horse a warrelike beast. The Fleminges beare the Bull in token of valiauntnes and hardines. The ensigne of King Antiochus was an Eagle ye helde a Dragon in his clawes, of Pompei, a Lion with 205 were saued by Geese that watched in the Capitoll againste the Frenchemen, coulde not be moued for so greate a benefit receiued to beare a Goose in theire ensignes. Perhaps there be of them, which beace in their armes a Cocke and a Goate because they be prowde and lecherouse: which be the especial endowmentes of noblemen. For the same cause they beare the Peakecocke for for pride: and the Lapwinke, which seemeth to haue some royall thinge, and weareth a crowne: neither doth it endamage Nobilitee, that he maketh his neste in ordure, for in time past Vaspasiane the Emperour also tooke tribute of vrine, saying: That the sauour of gaine did not stincke Many small liuing thinges moreouer haue a prerogatiue in these armes, if so be they teach some destruction, otherwise not to be admitted. In ye nuber of these be Connies, Wants, Frogges, Locustes, Mise, Serpents, Sapeges, Scolopenders, by whiche it is supposed (as Plinie saithe) that people haue sometimes bene driuen awaye, & Cities destroied, and for the same causes also we wil very gladly graunt to them gnates, puneses, flies, and if they will botches, bleanes, biles, pestilence: for with these in time past was Egypt scurged vnder Pharao and Moses: which are garnished with ye Frenche pockes. There be of the also which set in their Shieldes, Swords, Daggers, Halberds, Ares, Hagbuttes, Towers, Castles, Ingins, Fiers, and many other instruments of homicide, and destructio. Furthermore the ensignes of the Scythians was in time past lightninge, of the Persians a bowe & quiuers, of the Corallans, Neptune the tripletoothed mace, Mars the Iaueling, Bacchus the Speare wrapped in Bowes, and iuye, Saturne the sieth. And euery one of these badges of armes accordinge to the expression of his cruelty, rauine, violence, manhoode rashnesse, and other vertues of Nobilitee, as the Herauldes doo appointe, are supposed some nobler then some. And the tergates that want them & expresse milder things, as trees, flowers, starres, & suche like, as Apolloes harpe, Mercuries rodde, or be parted with the onely varietie of coloures, be much more latter, & lesse noble then the firste, because it is not thought that they haue not ben gotten with any martial prowesse, or with any other skil of bloudshedde or death, yet it is a marueile to see with what a foolishe wisedome these Herauldes of armes do play the Astronomers, Philosophers & deuines in these matters, whilest they attribute 207 cause, constancie, silence, and patience: they will moreouer that the blewe and asure coloure signifie faithe, or after the opinion of the Frenchemen ieolousie reuengement, for the Seigniourie of furiouse Mars. The yelowe coloure of golde is dedicated to the sonne, and thei say, that it signifieth desire and mirth, for the price of his mettal, & for the most cleare shining of the sonne. They assigne purple and grene to Venus, and thei say that purple signifieth loue taking pleasure in roseall coloure, but the Frenchemen woulde haue it to importe subtiltee to treason. Greene by the consent of al men doth signifie hope, because when the fields waxe greene, men hope for fruit. The white colour is attributed to ye mone, which although it be simple without mixture, yet easilye taking al mixture, they wil that it signifie purenes, plainesse, aptnesse. Al the other mingled coloures they attribute to Mercurie, who as he is wandring and vnconstat, so doo they declare the varietee of the minde. For a shie colour, as nighest to blacke, signifieth trouble of minde: carnation as of bloude letten, secrete greife of the minde, or hidden thought: but yelowe, cleare, or darke, like leaues when they fall, and witheringe herbes, desperation and suspition. It shoulde be longe to rehearse the clatteringe toyes that they fayne of the humours, complexions, and the times of the yeare, of the monethes, and dayes, of the angles of the worlde and windes, of the signes, planets, plantes, stoanes, of the Sacramentes and Mysteries of ye Churche: all drawe well neare the whole Apocalyps by force to these fables: and this is that Heroical Philosophy of the Heroical Heralds. I would here haue made an end of this matter, if I had not remembred that I had passed ouer the originall of the Heraldes, and therefore I 208 Heralds to be so called of Heroes. Heroes were olde Souldiers: which alone ought to be Heralds, & so this dutche woorde Herald signifieth, that is to saye, an olde man in armes, or els an olde Swouldier. But nowe a dayes certaine meane men, Embassadoures, and messengers sent to entreate of warre and peace, whiche neuer were Souldiers, haue this office. But the Priuiledges and the offices of Heraldes whiche were manye hundrethe yeares paste doo continewe vntill this daye. Father Bacchus was their first creauncer, who, when he had coquered India, he created them with these woords: I 209 doo now discharge you from the labours of warre, I will that you be called old Souldiers, and Heroes: your office shalbe to prouide for the comon weale, to chastice offenders: to praise good men, and from other duties ye shalbe free in all places, & to what countrie soeuer ye shal come, Kinges will geue you meate, drinke, & clothe, you shalbe honoured of euery man, Princes will presente you with giftes, and geue you their garmentes, let your woordes and deedes be one, you shall abhorre lies, you shall iudge traitours, and pronounce them infamouse, which ill entreate women: it shalbe lawful for you to go thorow out al the world, and your passage and abidinge shalbe salfe. If any shall do iniurie to you, or any one of you in woorde or deede, he shalbe striken with a swoorde. Alexander the Great, a longe time after put to the priuiledges of these Heroes, that they might weare Golde, Purple, Skarlet, and coate armour, and also beare armes, & rayall badges in what coaste and countrie so euer they were. He willed moreouer that if any had beaten or wronged them in woorde, that he should lose his goodes & his heade. In this wise Eneas declareth that Thucidides, Herodotus, Didymus, Megasthones, had framed ye Romane  210 Monarchie, he honored them with this law: What euer thou be, that shalte serue with vs in Warres ten yeares space, so that thou shalt be. xl. yeares old, whether thou haste serued on foote, or on horse backe, hereafter be thou free from warre, he thou Heroes and an olde Souldier: let no man forbidde thee the Citie, the streate, the Temple, lodging, & his house: let noman laie any blame to thy charge, put any burdeine vpon thee, and aske thee any monie: if thou shalte offende in any thinge, looke to be chastised by C aesar, and noman els, in all dishonestie that men shall committe, I will that thou be their iudge & discloser, whether they shall be priuate men or officers: that which thou shalt saie and affirme for truthe, no man shall reproue for false, I will that al waies and places be free and open to thee, thou shalte haue authoritee to eate & drinke at the tables of Princes, thou shalte yearely haue wages of the common treasure to finde thee, & thy householde: let her be preferred before other women, whiche thou shalte take to thy lawful wife: he whom thou shalte reproue, & cal infamouse, let him be wicked & infamouse, thou being Heroes shalte haue authoritee to beare armes, badges, names and ornaments, which be conuenable for a Kinge: doo what thou wilt in euery place and countrie where thou comest. If any shall doo thee wronge, let his head be cut of. Lastly Charles the Great, when he had 211 Lombardes were vanquished, beinge called C aesar & Augustus, gaue them this honoure, sayinge: My Souldiers ye shalbe called Heroes, the companions of Kinges, and iudges of offences, liue ye hereafter voide of labour, counsaile Kinges in the publike authoritee, reproue dishonest things, fauour women, healpe orphans, let not Princes misse you counsaile, and aske of them meate, drinke, and monie: if any of them shal denie it, let him be vnrenowmed and infamouse: if any shall doo you iniurie, let him knowe that he hath offended the Emperours Maiestie: but ye shall forsee that ye distaine not so great an honour, and so great a priuiledge, gotten by the great labour of warre with dronkenesse, railing, or with any other vice: to the ende that that which we haue geue you for glory, redounde not to punishment, whiche we will foreuer reserue to be geven you by vs, and our successours Emperours of Rome And this is the magnificence of the Herauldes, wherewith by auncient custome of times they repute themselues great men, because it is lawful for the, without punishment, to depraue the woorthiest. But now let vs passe from warrefare, and nobilitee to Phisicke, whiche also is a certaine Arte of man-slaughter altogeather seruill, although it presume to passe vnder the title Philosophie, & aboue the knowledge of the lawe, doth seeke to haue the nexte place to diuinitee, wherefore there is a greate contention betwene Phisitions and Lawiers. For the Phisitions argue in this manner: Seinge that there be three kindes of goodes by order, of the Soule, Bodie, and of Fortune: the diuine hath charge of the firste, the Phisition of the seconde, the Lawiers of the thirde, for this cause they will that the Phisitions haue the midle place aboue the Lawiers, in so muche as the strength and healthe of the bodie is better then the riches of Fortune. But there was a certaine 212 Mayor of a Citie, whom I know not, that made an ende of this matter in variaunce, with a preatie and pleasant demaund. For he asked of them that were in strife, what vsage & order was obserued in caryinge men to the Galowes, whether wente before, and behind the theefe or the Hangeman? And when they aunsweared that the theefe wente before, and the Hangeman nexte, he gaue sentence, sayinge: the Lawiers then goo before, and the Phisitions come after: reprouinge in this manner theire notable robberie, and rashe murders. But returne we to Phisicke, which hath many sectes: for there is our, which they call Rationall, or Sophisticall, or Dogmaticall, and this haue Hippocrates, Diocles, Chrysippus, Caristinus, Paraxagoras, and Horosistratus followed, which Galene, a longe time after these, did approue: who following Hippocrates more then others reduced the whole Arte of Phisicke to the knowledge of causes, and signes, to the qualitees of thinges, and diuers plighees and likinges of bodies. But because this secte hath to do about woords, rather then aboute the thinges themselues, I confesse it is not the meanest parte of naturall Philosophie, yet not very necessarie to cure the diseased, I will not saie hurtefull, as that whiche referreth mens saulftie and health to certaine wrested Sophisines, rather then to pure Medicines, with whiche diseases maie be cured: and busied in scholerlike Syllogismes, ignoraunt of desertes, wooddes, and gardens, dothe not knowe hearbes, and medecine: wherefore Serapion confessed that this Rational Phisicke belonged not to the Arte of healinge maladies. There is then an other secte of Phisicke altogether gainefull and seruill, whereof Phisitions vntill this vaie haue theire name. For this cause they call it Operatiue, that is workinge, deuiding the same into Empericall, & Methodicall, hereof in this place we haue to speake. Wherefore they call it Empericall, that is to saie, that consisteth in practise, of experimentes, the heades whereof were Serapion, Heraclides, and both the Apollonij: whom after warde of the Latines Marcus, Cato, C. Valgius, Pomponius, Leneus, Cassius Foelix, Aruntius, Cornelius Celsus, Plinie, & many other followed. Of this Hierophilus the Chalcedonian, made afterwarde the Methodicall, that is compendious to learne by, and by longe experience the mistresse of all thinges, reduced it to certaine rules, whiche afterwarde Asclepiades, Themistion, & Archigenes did approue with moste stronge argumentes: But Thesillus the Italian was he that brought it to perfection, who (as Varro saithe) disanulled all the opinions of them whiche were before him, and as it were with a certaine doggish madnesse enueighed against al the Phisitians of the time paste. After these very many barbarouse Philosophers of foreine nations wrote thereof, emonge whome the the first finders out of this Arte, and without doubte it semeth that they maie striue for it, if the woordes which they vse grounded vpon the Greeke & Latine, did not declare an other originall of this Arte. For this cause the volumes of Auicenna, Rasis, and Auerrois haue benne receaused in like authoritee with the bookes of Hippocrates, and Galene, and haue gotten so great credite, that if one presume to heale an other without theire opinions, he semeth manifestly to endomage the common saulftie of men. And although these sectes of Phisitions be fewe, yet there is no lesse contention, and diuersitee of opinions emonge them, then emonge the Philosophers. For hire with what foolishe and vaine reasons they dispute of Sperme, whiche is the naturall humour whereof liuinge thinges be engendred and fourmed: Pythagoras of the profitablest bloudde, or els the profitablest superfluitee of meate. Plato said: that it was a rennyng downe of the marowe of the backe bone, because theire backes & reynes doo ake, which vnmeasurable vse the acte of generation. Alcmeon affirmeth it to be a parte of ye braine, because the eies of them that fulfill the fleashly lustes, doo ake, whiche are partes of the braine. Democritus saith: that it is a thinge that commeth from all partes of the bodie, and Epicurum will that it be taken from the bodie and soule. Aristotle saithe, that it is a superfluitee of blouddie nourishment, whiche is laste of all digested in the members. Others thinke that it is bloudde boyled and made white thorowe the heate of the stoones, moued onely by this reason, because they, whiche vse the pleasures of loue more then theire force can endure, doo voide droppes of bloude. Moreouer Aristotle and Democritus saie, that the seede of a woman auaileth nothinge to generation, and that thei voide no seede, but a certaine particular sweate. Galene saith, that they voide sperme, albeit vnpri fect for generation, and that the seede of bothe, of the man and the woman doth make liuing creature. But Aristotle will, that the bodies of liuinge thinges be engendred firste of all of bloudde, and immediatly to be nourished, and that the naturall humoure is engendred of bloude: Hippocrates contrarywise saithe, that the bodies of liuing creatures be first engendred of the foure humours. Many Arabians also haue supposed, that perfecte liuinge creatures mais be engendred without the coniunction of male and female, & be brought foorth with out seede: and therfore they saide that the matrices were not necessarie but by accidente. But to entreate of the originall causes of diseases, Hippocrates placeth them in the breathe without the spirite. Hierophilus in the humours: Erasistratus in the bloudde of the Artieres, Asclepiades considereth them of the indiuisible partes receaued into the inuisible pores of the bodie. Alcmeon of the abundance or wante of the pawers of the bodie. Diocles of the vnequalitee of the bodily elementes, and fetchinge of the breath. Strato beleued that all diseases came onely of superfluitee, rawnesse of the stomake, and of the corruption thereof. They likewise disagree in the alteration of the meate. For Hippocrates, Galene, and Auicen, doo affirme that the meate is digested in the stomake by heate. Erasistratus will that this be donne in the belly. Plistonicus, and Paraxagoras saie, that it doth not onely digeste, but putriste also: But whiche is more Auicen, and his expositours, Gentiles, and Iames of Forline, not without a notable errour doo teache that ordure is engendred in the stomake: Asclepiades and his followers doo suppose that meate is not digested, but is deuided rawe thorowe out all the bodie, and furthermore they saie that the learning of all the auncientes is vaine, and superfluouse. I speake not of ye iudgementes of waters, not yet perfectly knowe of them, and the pawsinges of the pulses not to be comprehended. Hippocrates moreouer whom they woorship for a God, hath not onely differed in many thinges from other, but also fallen into a foule erroure. For in his booke of the nature of a childe, he saith: A birde is engendred of the yolke of an egge, but he hath nourishmente and encreasinge of the white, that is in the egge: whiche Aristotle proueth to be false in this booke of liuinge creatures, and in his booke of the generation of liuinge creatures disputinge against Alcmeon, who was of Hippocrates opinion, he concludeth thus: The originall of the birde is in the white: the meate commeth from the yolke thorowe the nauell, to whiche opinion Plinie dothe also agree, sayinge: the birde taketh his bodie of the white licour of the egge, whose meate is in the yolke. Is not that Aphorisme of Hippocrates false: A woman hath not the Goute, except her flowers faile: where as many women haue the Goute, which haue their flowers. The whole Arte of Phisicke moreouer is builden vpon no other fundation, then vpon false experimentes, and fortified with the light beleefe of the Sicke, no lesse venemous then beneficiall, so that oftentimes, and well neare alwaies, there is more daunger in the Phisition, and the medicine, then in the sickenesse it selfe, which thing the very chiefest in this Arte doo freely confesse, that is to witte, Hippocrates, sayinge: that this Arte is harde, and deceaueth the Phisition in proufe. And Auicen saithe: that oftentimes the faithe and hope of the patient towardes the Phisition, and the medicine, is of more force then Phisicke togeather with the Phisition: and Galene affirmeth that a Medecine can hardly be founde which maie healpe muche, and that at one very instant dothe not hurte in somethinge: and an other of them I wotte not who, saithe, the knowledge of Phisicke is pleasaunt, and of al other thinges, which consiste of Arte and rules, but the practise accordinge to Phisicke is a chaunce. Letie aduenturous sicke men nowe good, and geue credits to perilous experimentes and to chaunce, but so pleasuant (as Plinie saith) is euery mans sweetnes of hope alone, that euery one is beleued ye professeth him self a Phisition, whereas there is no greater daunger in any leesing. Hereof it commeth to passe that diuers times health is there soughte, where death is, for he is thought the beste Phisition, whom the Apothecarie, which is partaker of his gaine, dothe commende, who practiseth deceipte with him to beguile others, whose seruauntes the Phisitian doth also binde vnto him by giuinge them monie, whiche exercisinge the office of bawdes, & praysinge him doo preferre him to the pituous sicke men very excellent also is that Phisitian, whiche is clad in braue apparaile, hauing ringes on his fingers glimeringe with pretious stoanes, and whiche hath gotten authoritee, fame, and credence for hauinge bene in farre countries, for hauinge made longe pilgrimages, or for beinge of a diuers Religion (as a Iewe or a Marane,) for hauinge a very effectuall vnshamefastnes of face to deceaue, and an obstinate manner of auaunting with stiffe lies, that thei haue great remedies. Which hath also won him ye credite of a learned man for standing alwaies in cotention, & for hauing cotinually in his mouth many wordes halfe Greeke & barbarous: & for reckening vp many names of their authors, & being in this maner instructed more the with a leaden grauitee, & as it were with a Souldiers boldnesse, wt this Hipcrisie, he then taketh in hand to practise Phisicke. 214 First he visiteth the sicke, he beholdeth ye water, he feeleth ye pulse, he looketh on the tonge, he gropeth ye sides, he looketh on the ordure, he wil knowe his maner of diet, and searcheth also if there be any things more secrete, as if by these he meigheth the Elementes, and as it were trieth in a balance the humours of the patiente, & lyeth a pace: afterwarde with a greate auaunting he prescribeth him medicines, take pilles, be letten bloud, let clisters be made, let pitche clothes be made, let oinctments be made, let plaisters be made, let brothes be geuen him, let things be geue him to chawe, let gargarismes be made, let little bagges be made, let perfumes be made, let pleasant meat be geuen him, let sirupes be geuen him, let water be geuen him, let triacle be geue him: and if the desease be not behement, and the patient somewhat delicate he wil prouide for pleasaunte thinges, and with greate authoritee doth commaunde that all suche thinges shoulde be donne whiche he thinketh acceptable and pleasaunt to women & effeminate man, and when he hath laide him vpon a softe bedde, ha endeuoureth to bring him a sleepe with droppes of well water fallinge into a basen, sometime he minisheth the sicknesse with rubbinge, sweatinge, and cuppinge: sometime he restoreth the enfeobled sicke man with bathes, delicate meate, and with the chaunge of the aire: and that he maie be accompted of greate authoritee, and also be wondred at, obseruing howers he causeth natural alligations & bindinges to be tied about his necke, and dothe not minister medicines and drinkes but by the Mathematicall Ephimerides. They presume also to beare rule ouer the Apothecarie, & biddeth him to compownde al things in his presence, and maketh as though he chose the best drogues, although oftentimes he cannot discerne ye counterfait from the true, and knoweth not the things by theire names. If the sicke parson be riche, or of greate authoritie, than to the ende that then he may haue more gayne and reputation, he prolongeth the disease asmuche as he maye, and doth not restore him to healthe but by little & little, albeit he can at ones driue awaye the disease with one medicine, and otherwhile he bringeth the man to ertreame daunger of his life, encreasinge the disease with his medicines, to the ende that then he maye be sayde to haue deliuerd him from a most greauous and dangerous sicknesse. And if at any time a sicke man happen into his handes, that is greeuously sicke, and shall knowe that the disease perilouse, and the ende therof vncertaine, then he creepeth in with these subtilties: with a rough countenaunce he prescribeth rules of diet, he commaundeth vnaccustomed thinges, and forbiddeth him his ordinarye meats, he blameth that which is geue him, he threatneth him death, he promiseth him life, and demaundeth greate rewardes. If he doubteth of the ende, he counsaileth him to cal to togeather his companie and demaundeth a mate, they he maye cure the diseased with more suertie, or els, as oftentimes it commeth to passe, that he maye kill him more warely leaste that an other comming in place, who alone restoreth the sicke man to healthe, maye take from him his reputation, prayse, & gaine also. If any mishappe shall befall to the patiente, or els if contrary to his exspectation thoro we manifest ignoraunce he shal depriue him of his life, than he doth colurably excuse himselfe in saying that it proceeded either of the strangling renning of ye reume, or of some other like sodaine accidente, and remediles chaunce, and he sharply rebuketh the disobedience of the patient, or the negligece of the keepers, he blameth them of his companie, or putteth the fault in the Apothecarie: and in this manner he maketh men beleeue, that no sicke man dieth but thorow his owne faulte, and that no man can be restored to healthe, but by the meanes of the Phisition. But wil also proue his to be true, that Phisitions moste commonlye be naught, and that with theire 215 that the Arte of Phisicke is ascribed to Mars, which is the hatefullest of all the Planetes and which is the authour of ingratitude, brawlinge, and of all iniquitee and naughtinesse. And therefore Phisitions for the moste parte be ill conditioned, aswell for the influence of Mars and Scorpio, as especially because, as he saithe, they toke beginning of a viloand a barraine blocke, waxinge afterwarde prowde and spitefull, when they were well stuffed, these be his woordes. He was taught perhaps by the example of Esculapius, whome the auncient fables doo recorde to haue bene the firste finder out of Phisicke, begoten of the minde of Iupiter, and bsluy the life of Sol sente downe on earthe. But Celsus confesseth, that he was a man, but receiued into the numbr of the Gods. Many other affirme that he was begot in fornicatio of a comely queane called Coronides, of whom oftetimes of Priestes in the Temple of Apollo tooke armorous delites, whiche faigned him to be sonee of theire God. All doubtles doo herein agree, that this God Esculapius was so wicked, ye he needed the lightning of Iupiter to chastice him, of who Lactantius writeth in this wise to Constantine Apollo, what did he at any time worthye of diuine honours, but that he healed Hippolitus? Surely he died honourably, because he deserued to be slaine with lightning by God: these be his woordes. But to tel the truth, Phisitions be the wickedest, the contentiouste, the enuiuste, & the falsest men of al other. For al doo in such wise disagree emonge themselues, that there is founde no Phisitiane, who, without exception, addition, or chaunginge, dothe approue the medicine appointed by an other: but rather doth not speake il of them, and sclaunder them, to the end that he may not seeme to be the better Phisition, if he shal not speake amisse of the good counsaile of an other, or els not adde any thinge to them, whiche oftentimes also be too many, wherfore finally the enuie and discorde of Phisitions is growen to a Prouerbe. For whatsoeuer one 216 alloweth, the other skorneth, neither is there certaintee emonge them, but all their promises be vaine trifles, and merelyes: for this cause when the common people will shewe any that lyeth shamefully, they saye to him: thou liest like a Phisition. And the greatest laboure of theire wittes is occupied in this, that in diuising new matters, the good woorkes of the anncientes may be neglected and dispised; thei hide also the smal knowledge that thei haue, or they will not vtter it, as though the reputation of the science were to teach noman, and so enuyinge others do also disapointe our life of other mens goodnes. They are moreouer very superstitious, arrogaunte, of a naughty conscience, prowde, and couetouse, hauinge alwayes this 217 that to ake, whiche is whole, if they thinke it wil tourne them to profit, as we reade of Peter of Appona (whom they call theire attonemaker) who readinge Phisicke in Bononia was so couetous, and arrogaunte, 218 that goinge to anye place oute of the Citie to visite sicke parsons, woulde not be hited vnder fiftie ducatrs a daye: and beinge on a time sent for to Honorius then Pope, he couenaunted to haue foure hundreth ducates a day. Pindarus saith also that Esculapius father of Phisicke was by Iupiter striken with lightninge for a due deserte of couetousnes, bicause wickedly and to the damage of the common wealthe he had practised Phisicke. And if by anye chaunce the diseased shal happely recouer in their hands, they reioyce without measure, noman will be able to set fourth the glory of so great a miracle. They will say that he hath raised Lazarus from death, ye he gaue him his life, that he is bound to thanke them that he is a line: & by and by, (attributing that to themselues, which belogeth onely vnto God) they auaunt that they haue drawen him out of hel, & say, that no rewarde can conteruaile their deserte. Some of the haue ben in such wise pussed vp with pride, that thei suffered themselues to be worshipped for Gods, & caused themselues to be called Ioues, as Menecrates the Syracusane Phisition, who is reade to haue writen on a time to Agesilaus King of Sparta in these woordes: Menecrates Iupiter sendeth greeting to King Agesilaus, but Agesilaus, laughing priuely at his foly, aunsweared in this wise: Agesilaus desireth health to Menecrates: But if any vnhappy dissased parson die in ye hands of the Phisitias, whiche oftentimes chaunceth, than they put the faulte to the weakenes of nature, to the extremitee of the sicknes, or to the vnrulinesse of the patiente, and that the remedies of theire Arte doth not extende to this secrete of cruel nature, and that they be Phisitians, not Gods, that they can heale the curable, but not to restoare the deade to life, and that thei cannot minister nothing to the sicke, but what experience hathe taught them, and with these woordes also they be high minded in vnprosperous chauces, & moreouer thei accused them that died, of disorder, and there with al they wilbe payde, when with their recepites thei haue killed them, which without them might haue liued, spuylinge the sicke at one instaunte of theire fame, monie, healshe and life, hauing in the meane while a salfe conscience: aswell because theire erroure, (as Socrates saithe) is couered in the earth, as especially because the countrie of the dead is it remeable, that they cannot retourne, which they deceiuing with beene woordes, and infecting with noysome medicines, do depriue of life before theire time, isaste that thei accuse them of extorcion, and murder. Furthermore Phisitions oftentimes be contagious, and stinking by reason of vrine, and ordure, bepissed, and besheten, and filthier then midwiues, hauing all their senses infected, whilest that with their eies they behold most filthy and strinking thinges, with their eyes and nose they receiue the belking of sicke men, their fartinge, their breathinge, blowinge, and stinckinge of theire breathe, they taste firste with theire lippes and toungue, blacks and deadly drinckes, with their handes they stirre ordure and excrementes, and daye and nighte they haue in their fantasie, the ouglie images and ghosts of the sicke, and innumerable murders doo trowble their conscience: and finally all theire studie, talke, reason, communication, minde, and wit, is conuersaunte aboute nothinge but naughtie, filthye, and lothsome thinges, and horrible kindes of deathe and diseases: and all theire exercise is in stincking and filthie places, occupied in vile cares, and vncleane skill, for infamous gayne sake they alwayes stande about sicke mennes iakeses and pispots, and like the lapwinge a silthy birde, doo builde their neste of mannes ordure. Doo you not daylie see howe they goo about the Citie with ringed singers, and dirtie gownes, with a sadde countenaunce, and alwayes pale, and with a quicke pace, for hope of veray vile gayne, renne from one Apothecaries shoppe to an other, seekinge and begging, if in any place a man will offer them vrine, or a boll of ordure to looke vpon & as the hooded vultures are beste nosed about deade bodies, so these me, are best nosed of al about excremets: which they say: Hippocartes was wont also to taste, that thereby he might the better perceiue the nature of the sicknesse: whiche thinge also many doo attribute to Esculapius: who for this cause was of Aristophanes called Scatophagos, in whiche woorde they be signified, whiche feede vpon the super fluitees of meates, whiche name afterwarde was deriued to all Phisitions, in suche wise, thae wee call them Scatoghagians this cause Scatonsacie, Orompancie, Drymimancie, be called the diuinations or Prognestications of Phisitias, gathered by ordured and vrines. Wherefore emonge many nations these seruill Phisitions were in time paste reputed infamous; and more then that, (as Seneca testifieth) it was accompted a very greate infamie to seeke the seruice of a Phisition, and at this day also, many people doo exclude Phisitions, Midwiues, and executioners from theire tables and bankets, or els they geue them meate and orinke in dishes, and coppes aparte from the other: wherefore a man maye here haue indignation againste that detestable custome of many Princes, which allowe, these pestilente menne not onely to come to theire bedde side in the morninge, but to theire tables also, beinge infected with the dayly visiting of the sicke, and with the fresh vapour of pestilence, and that more is, if one bidde a Phisition to a feast, whilest he is at dinner, he wil talke of nothinge but of ordures, vrines, sweatinges, corrupted bloude, vomitinge, and of the flowers, and will entreate of the fallinge sicknesse, of leprosie, of botehes, of scabbes, and of the plage, and with the filthines of his communication, he will cause al menne to lothe the banket, well furnished with veray daintie dishes. Wse also a Phisition, in ciuill consultations, and ye shall silide noman more sonde and foolishe then he, and that perhappes aswell because the doctriue of Phisitions (as theire reconciler saith) cosisteth not one vertues, nor good conditios, as especially because (as the same saith) euery Phisitio, which is honeste by nature, oughte to be ill conditioned, and I knowe, that in many cities, it is prouided by publike decrees and ordinaunces, that Phisitions maye not be receiued into counsaile, nor beare office, peraduenture not so muche because they be foolishe, vayne, and stubborne, as because they be alwayes vncleane, and so contagious by reason of the continuall handlinge of sickemen, and ordure, that they doo not onely infecte them whiche approch neare to them, but the seates also, and likewise the marble stoanes as Lucilius preatelie hath write of a certaine Phisition in a greeke Epigramme, translated into latine by Ausonius, and may thus be inglished. Alcon , in Phisicke skilde, laste day did touche The signe of Ioue , and though he marble were, By him he wronge enduerde. Beholde to daye From auncient temple out he borne is Although a stoane and eke a God he be. But when they assemble their colledge togeather to trie out that, whiche the diseased hathe pissed or shiten the nighte before, and as it were the iudges of the Lacedemonians called Ephori to giue sentence of life and death, it is a marueilous thinge, but muche more to be lamented with how many miserable altercations without any iudge they than doo stande at contention aboute the sicke mannes bedde, as thoughe they haue benne hired not to cure, but to dispute, and that the diseased, to whome (accordinge to the Greeke verse of Menander, whiche in Englishe is: The bablinge Phisition is as it were a sicknes to the diseased) well neare al communication is greuous, hathe more neede of theire reasoninge, then of their Phisicke, and when they haue like schollers cited certayne Aphorisines, for an oftentation, whiche onely they haue readye at all times for euerye pourpose, and called vpon Hyppocrates, Galene, Auicen, Rasis, Auerrois, theire Reconciler, and other of theire Goddes, whose names and titles serue them in steede of learning to purchase credit, and reputation of knowledge emonge the ignoraunte people, they haue for a space benne at daggers drawinge touchinge the causes, signes, dispositions, humours, and critical dayes, but without discussinge theire controuersie, at the length, they conclude with a very selender ordinaunce, concerninge the applyinge the applying of the remedie, which ought to be the heade and tayle of all the matter: and as there is a mutuall enmitee emongest them, none of them beinge willinge to make theire secretes common (as thei terme it) to theire enuiers, as if they shoulde lose that whiche they haue taught vnto others, they haue recourse to the common methods, whiche if it disapointe them, they repayre to practise, as to the holy anker, to the ende, that whom reason restoreth not, rashnesse maye further, sayeinge: that it is better to proue a doubtfull helpe, then none at all: or els leaue the diseased when they cannot helpe him, and that continuall feeblenesse (as Ecclesiasticus saith) dothe greeue them: sayeing that Hyppocrates forebadde medicines to be giuen to desperat parsons: or if they be some what religiouse, they referre the disease to some saincte, they appointe ye last receit of al which is this. Take a notarie, and seuen witnesses, put thereto a Priest with holy water and oile, asmuch as is needefull, & leaue who doubtlesse not onely knewe the foolishe beliefe of the sicke, but also the contentious ignorance of the Phisitians, prouiding not vnwisely for bothe, that is to saie, for the patiente and the Phisition, counsaileth in his Aphorismes, that one Phisition alone ought to be chosen: because, saith he, one mans errour causeth no greeat infame: and the profite whiche one man doth to the diseased, is commended: but he that shall vse very many Phisitions, incurreth into an exceedinge greate errour: these be the woordes of Rasis. slewe him: and that Greekishe Prouerbe: The accesse of many Phisitions killed the diseased: That sayinge also of Adriane the Emperoure lyinge at the pointe of death: The rable of Phisitions hath destroyed the Prince. Wherfore there is no cousaile more profitable for the preseruinge of life & health, then to abstaine from Phisitions. For thanke God for the health of bodie, and not the Phisitions, and for this cause, Asa Kinge of Iuda was rebuked by the Prophete of the Lorde, because in his sickenes he sought not ye Lorde, but trusted in the Phisitions Arte: to whose counsailes they whiche geue credence, will neuer be hole: for there is no life more miserable then that, which is guided vnder the hope of their healpe. I put the case tha the Phisitions knowe, and I would to God they knew al the vertues and operations of the Elementes, rootes, hearbes, flowers, fruites, feedes, of liuinge creatures also and minerals, and of all thinges, whiche nature the mother of them hath brought foorth, yet they cannot with all these vertues not onely make man immortall, but whiche is lesse, not alwaies cure him that is sicke of euery lighte disease. O how often hath not ye medecine preuailed, which should haue preuailed, and whiche should purge, hath not purged: how often hath the diseased fallen sicke, & gonne to Phisicke estsones, & at the legth after many troubles, and greate expences, either than, or shortly after, euen in the presence of Phisitions, he must die. What confidence shoulde we than haue in Phisitions, if (as Hippocrates him selfe saithe) theire experience be vncertaine? What certaine thinge can phisitions promesse, if that betrue which Plinie writeth, that no Arte is more vnconstante then Phisicke, nor whiche oftener is chaunged? There were many nations in time paste and at this daie are, which liue without Phisitions, which not withstandinge we see lustie, when they are at the pittes brincke, and to liue aboue a hundreth yeares: contrarywise that these nice people, whiche liue with the labour & promises of Phisitions, for the most parte, doo waxe olde, and die in the flower of their yeares: & which is more, that is Phisitions themselues are sicke, more than other me, and almost continually, and die before their natural time. For this cause that Lacedemonian made aunsweare to one that saide vnto him, hast thou no sicknesse: no, because I doo not vse the Phisition, and he replyinge againe, thou arte an old man, answeared he, because I neuer vsed the Phisition, shewing that there is no other waie more certaine for healthe and olde age, then to be without Phisitions: But if a man saie, that many haue benne recouered by the meanes of Phisitions, we will answeare him contrarywise that many haue died, whom Phisicke hath nothing profited, and we will laie to his reproche that verset of Ausonius sayinge: By fatall chaunce he did escape, and not by phisickes healpe. saithe) they vsed milke of the springe time, because than, more then at any other season, hearbes are full of iuyce, & he furitefullest serued for Medecines: but before the rest they choose cowes milke, because they eate all kinde of hearbes. The Lacedemonians also, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, & the Portingals (as Herodotus were sicke into the market place, and into the streates, to the ende that they, whiche were attached with the like sicknesse, and had escaped, or knewe an other to haue escaped, might counsaile them with the remedies which they haue proued vpon themselues: supposinge, (whiche Cornelius Celsus doth also affirme) that there is nothing more auaileable to the trade of Phisicke then experience, wherein it is manifestly seene, that the beste learned men haue benne oftentimes ouercome by an olde wise of the Countrie, and shee with one roote or hearbe alone, hath atchieued suche thinges, as the beste Phisitions of all, coulde not doo with all theire pretiouse Medecines, done exactly with studie and diligence. For whilest they go about to cure diseases with intricate and monstruous mixtures (whereas nature hath broughte forth so many plaine remedies, which should suffice) confounding them by a copounde collinge of diuers thinges, they be leade rather by coniecture, then by cause, or reason, & make the whole Arte of Phisicke nothinge els but chaunce and coniecture. But this knowinge the force and qualitee of oneplaine medecine, doth cure harde diseases with sounde and approued vertues of nature. They on the other side, thorow pretious thinges brought from the farthest partes of India, or from the Gades, doo promisse & sell health to others: perswadinge them that nothinge els but thinges of great price can helpe. Nature doth not onely promisse, but also restore healthe with our owne countrie hearbes very easie to finde, and little esteemed, which euery man maie lightly haue growyng in his gardeine. Furthermore these with a presumptuous rashenesse, and bablinge gaiely set foorthe, hauinge learned it out of deceitpfull bookes, & painted Codicils, vse the hardest trade of phisicke to gaine by. This hauinge behelde and learned all the plantes growinge in the earthe, and fieldes, theire colours, formes sauours, smellinges, and diuersitees, & proued also of what vertue they be in sickenesses, and other chaunces, dothe without rewarde geue to euery man vndoubted remedies. The chiefest Phisitions also confesse, that they haue learned many moste excellent remedies of women, & woorthie to be put in their bookes, and as it were, singular thinges leste to the posteritee, as that Medecine whiche Auicen comendeth taught him by a woman against the head ache. But if it be true that the medecine, which ought to bringe a temperature of health, doth consist in the proportion and temperature of thinges togeather, aswel emonge themselues, as especially also with the quantities of the bodie, whereunto they be attributed, & this hath bene a moste diligente care in proportioninge, and temperinge Medecines, by iuste and harmonicall weightes, leauinge these to the posteritee, to be proporcioned to diseased mens bodies, what presumption, and sawcinesse is this not onely to alter these thinges, but to put to them also, or vtterly to despise or not to know them? Whereof it cometh to passe, that like as the iuste temperature Medecine oughte to bringe health, so the disagreement thereof bringeth griefe, feare, sharpnesse of sicknesse, and other while death, & therefore an olde wife of the country, dothe more saulfly cure with a Medecine made with one, or two hearbes of the gardeine, with ye worke of nature, then that Phisition with his monstruous, and sumptuous receiptes made with a doubtful coniecture. There haue bene in time paste many and moste excellent Philosophers and Phisitions of that opinion, that is to saie, that we shoulde not practise Phisicke but with very simple thinges. For this cause searchinge out and prouinge the forces of simples, they haue lefte to vs, which come after, notable bookes, as that whiche Chrysippus wrote of the Colewortes, Pythagoras of the hearbe Squilla, Marchion of the Radishe, Diocles of the Rape, Phanias of the Nettle, Apuleius of Betaine, and many other auncientes of other thinges. But these Phisitions of shoppes doo not onely passe vpon them, but also laugh them to skorne, callinge them simple men whiche studie to knowe simples. I therefore disswade no man not onely to aske counsaile of these Phisitions, but also to follow theire steppes, them I meane, which cure by simples. But I aduise them to flee and bannishe awaie these keapers of shoppes no otherwise then Inchaunters, & Witches, whiche with their monstruous consections make marchaundise of our infirmitees, & caste lottes for our life. For sithens it is necessarie that compounde Medecines be made of mony sundrie and contrary kindes, it is impossible or at least wise very difficults for the Phisition to appointe any certaintee in them, but by opinion alone, supposall, & coniecture: & sithens there be oftetimes innumerable things, euery of which by him self semeth to be of sufficient strength & vertue, against any griefe: The Phisitio maketh a hochpot of such things, as happe, & chaunce, shall then presente to his memorie, or els whereunto he shalbe inclined by any other inward or hidden instincte. Whereof it cometh to passe, that that compounde Medecine taketh vertue, & effect, not so much from the power o the simples whiche go into it, as from the happie or vnhappie intent of the Phisition, as farre as he is induced with a certaine hidden influence, either naturall, or celestiall, or Deuelishe, or aduenturous rather to choose these then other. And this is that, whiche is commonly saide, and they themselues doo confesse that one Phisition hath better lucke then a other, and very oftentimes the ignoraunt is happier then the learned. But whiche is more, I haue seene, & knowne a Phisition a man singularlie larned so vnhappie, that of many sicke parsons very few or none escaped aliue out of his hades. I knewe also an other searsly a smatterer in learninge, whiche happely healed well neare all his patientes, and many also which were leste by others as paste hope of recouerie. I remember also that I haue reade of a Phisitio, into whose handes, what noble men & potentates soeuer hand chaunced, escaped, & all the commons, and rude sorte perished, or were in great daunger. Wherefore it is now an easie thinge to perceaue that this shopee Phisicke, wherein the fortune of the Phisition can do more then learninge, is altogeather or for the moste parte deuinatorie, and therefore woorthie to be banished farre of, and condemned as venemous, and murderous. Wherefore the Romans, in time paste vnder Cato the Cesoure, banished all Phisitions out of Rome and al Italie, hating their mortal lies, & crueltie, that is to witte, because thei slewe many more, then they healed: also because thei, being very well skilled in makinge poisons, mighte easely be moued with hatred, ambition, or gaine, to minister poyson in steede of Medecine, and when they haue agreed for a summe of monie they sell mens liues: as the Phisition of Pyrrhus did, whether he were Timocaris, (as Gellius writeth) or Niceas, as some other recompte, who promised Fabritius, that he woulde kill his Master with a Medecine: whiche mischieuous acte Fabritius that he should beware of the Phisition, of whome Claudian speaketh in this manner: The Romans euer hated haue the workers of all ill: Fabricius him to Pyrrhus sente, that promisse made to kill VVith poyson rancke his master, in detestinge his entent, VVhom with fierce sight he did assaile and not about he wente To ende the warre through cursed deede of seruant Greeke Phisitions, sayinge: they haue sworne emonge themselues to kill all the Barbarians with Phisicke, but they will doo this for recompence to the ende that they maie be in credite, & safely atchieue theire wicked purpose. And shortly after he addeth, whereof arise many deceiptes in Testamentes, and aduoutries also in the houses of Princes, as that of Eudemus was euident in Liuia the wife of Drusus the Emperoure: these be the woordes of Plinie. Socrates also in Plato would not that there should be many phisitions in a Citie. And nowe a daies also it should be profitable for the common wealth, to haue very fewe Phisitions or none at all, & that there were a lawe to punishe the mortall mischiefe, aswell of their ignoraunce, as negligence. For it a deadly offence, & it maketh no matter, whether thorow wante of know ledge, or negligence, folly, or malice, vncarefully, or diligently, the Phisitio in steede of medecine, hath ministred poyson, and brought man in daunger of his life, and that the Phisition shoulde not (as Plinie saithe) escape cleare without punishment, for killinge of a man. Which truly to them, is one selfe and common honour with the hangman, that is to saie, to kill menne and to be recompenced therefore: and these men and none els be rewarded for murder, for which the law hath appointed a punishment to all other men, and hath pardoned and forgeuen none. Yet this difference there is, that the Hangement of Executioner, 220 killeth not the malesactours but accordinge to the sentence of the Iudge, but the Phisition againste all iudgement slayeth also the giltlesse. Wherefore not vnauaileably the ordinaunces of the Popes, doo forbidde the Clergie to practise Phisicke, for somuche as the Arte of Phisicke is so blouddie a thinge, that if it be lawfull for Priestes and the Cleregie to plaie the Phisitions, they maie also plaie the Hangemen. And that is to be thought wisely donne of Portius in time paste when he forbadde the Prisitio ns, aswell because they alwaies gaine the fame of this Science with some straungnes, as especially because whilest that they bringing no newe thing, are ashamed to treade in other mens steppes, proue experimentes by killing this man & that man, and learne their Arte with our daungers, wherewith they gaine by our life, & prolonge mens diseases, which might be curd in a very short space, & oftentimes thei encrease it for greater gaine: Wherefore the Egyptians prouidinge for this deceipte, appointed that the Phisitions should cure the bodies of the diseased within three daies to the daunger of the sicke, and after three daies to their owne perill. They call also Potecaries & Medecine makers theire Cookes, whose titles (as ye Prouerbe is haue remedies, & their bores, poyson, or (as Homer the which when they wil not doo vs any hurte they enforce vs to buye ouer death with a great summe of mome: whilest they ministringe to him one thing for an other, or els makinge a Medecine of rotten, stale, and mouldie drogues doo oftentimes geue a deadly drinke, in steede of a holsome Medecine, whilest that they buye plaisters made longe before, collyries, oyntments, lectuaries, and other Medecines, made of the refuse & filth of spices, and to no other ende but for the gaine of theire shoppes, and not knowinge to make a difference betwene al these thinges, they beleue the rude marchauntes coruptinge all thinges with deceiptes, & sophistications. I could here declare theue damnable discordes of the knowledge of simple Medecines which they vse, & their errours aboute the names of things that appertaine to Phisicke misunderstoode by them, and most wickedly vsed, the which beloge very many, Nicholas Leonicenus hath declared in a large volume. I let to speake of the manstruous confections, and mixtures of many and straunge thinges, with the which whilest they confounding all thinges wil perswade swade vs that they will make a Medecine which agreeth with euery nature: as they haue determined of ye making of triakle, of the fable of Tyrus, and of that lectuarie of Mithridates, nothing els is made but that poetical Chaos: A rude and vndisposed heape, and nothinge els but euen: A heauy lumpe and clottered clod, of seedes togeather driuen. Of thinges at strife emonge themselues, for wante of order due: VVherein one body hote and colde, and moyst and drie renewe A combrous fight,--- But be it, that there haue bene certaine profitable medicines made and diuised by the ancient Phisitions, which we maye receiue as thinges proued, yet they differ farre from that true methode, and condemned by the Phisitios themselues enforced through theire owne conscience so to doo, and altogeather reiected of Plinie, of Theophraste, of Plutarch, and Hippocrates, Galene, Dioscorides, Eistratus, Celsus, Scribonius, Auicenna whose woordes it were too tedious to write in this place: and not onely by these ancients, but also of many Phisitios of fresher memorie, emonge which Arnolde af Villa noua saith in his Aphorismes: where simples maye easily be had it is deceipte to vse compowndes. But now a daies thei dispising altogeather and not knowing simples, no receiptes be made but by these two famous Pillers of Potecaries, and treasure of spicers, painted Antidotaries, and golden titles of Mesue and Nicholas, and herof it commeth to passe, that whilest these Phisitions attendinge theire one leisure doo put the liues of men in the Potecarie handes: and they without learninge, and without knowledge geuinge credit to ignoraunt marchauntes for the auaile of their shop doo mingle thinges togeather, and muche more daugher commeth of the medicine then of the disease. But let vs discourse a little of the falsification of pretious thinges that serue for medicine which oftentimes be counterfaited with so muche deceipte, that they deceiue also experte and wise men: and it shoulde be muche auailable to the good state of men and the common wealth vtterly to forbidde all straunge and foreine medicines, whiche moreouer with so greate a price haue benne broughte into the realme by theeuishe marchauntes to the damage of the common wealthe, and to abate to Phisitions pride, and to hold the Apotecaries noses at the glindstone, & to prescribe them a lawe, such a one, as Nero (at that time when he gouerned well) is reade in time paste to haue made in Rome, wherewith they were compelled to vse onely such medicinable thinges, as our climate broughte foorthe, for asmuche as these doo better agree to the nature of euerye of vs, they be also muche more fresher, better chosen, and maye be had with lesse difficultie and expence, and with lesse daunger then the foreine, whiche for the most parte be suspected bicause thei be very oftentimes falfsified, couterfeited, or refused, or kept too close in the ship, or weate in ye pumpe, or rotten thorow age, or not gathered in due season and place, whereof oftentimes greate daunger is like to ensue, for coloquintida not ripe, draweth out bloud and killeth: and that which groweth alone, and by it self, is poyson. Semblably Agaricke masculine is deadly, and that whiche is olde is perilous, Scamonie is altogeather falsified, and likewise the earthe called Lemnie, and the faithfulnesse of seales is worne awaye. Nowe I besseche you what neede we vse these foreine things, if our countrie bringe foorthe the same thinges, or of like vertue. Is it not a great foly to go rather to India, for that which we haue at home; supposinge that our countrie and sea is not sufficient: & preferring foreine things before them of our coutrie, sumptuous before thrifty, and difficult & brought euen from the fardest partes of the worlde, before them ye maye easily be had. Cannot the Splene be cured without Armoniake, nor the liuer without saunders. What if we wante Bdellium cannot the greefes of the entrayles be healed? maye not the heade be cured without muske and amber? nor the stomake without masticke and corall? If these straunge medicines were couenable to our bodies, without doubte nature whiche prouideth for all thinges shoulde haue brought to passe, that they should also grow abundantly with vs. Did not our forefathers liue without them and more healthfully? These then be the trifles of sluggish Phisitions, whiche seeke not to know our medicinable things, & the inuentions of ye Apotecaries which seeke not for the common saftie, but for the profit of their trade, makinge vs beleue that all thinges of greate price can helpe vs and none els, whom Ieremie doth therefore reproue: Is there no rosen in Galaad, or is theire founde no Phisition; Nature bringeth foorthe and tempreth her hearbes in euery Countrie, Region, Nation, Climate, Aire, and Age: we graunte that is true, and that some things haue more vertue in one place and time the in an other, notwithstanding they woorke the same effectes in euery time and climate, accordinge to the proper temperature of men, admit that those rare and pretious things be of greater force then our hearbes: but we ought to beleue that thei are not holsome, but for the men of that climate, for whom they are created and brought foorth. But there are moreouer the rauinies of the Phisitions which perswade vs that certaine monstrous medicines, & differinge from the vse of Phisicke be muche auailable, and that without them we cannot be in health prouinge their saygned diuises with the destructio of miserable menne. For this cause thei put in medicines, Uipers, Serpents, and al venemous Wormes, and if they wante remedies, thei put mans greace in oyntementes, & with a greeuous offence of nature they geue men mans flesh to eate, preserued in spices whiche they call Mummia. Surgerie is not yet sopken of, which is an other parte of Phisicke, that cureth the diseases of the hody which are in the fileshe the practises whereof be apparaunte and sure remedies, for the counsailes of other Phisitions be vncertaine. The Surgeans see and feele what thei do, and accordinge as neede requireth they chaunge, laye to, and take away: this emong all the Artes of Phisicke was the firste that came in vse. For when men in time paste made warres emonge themselues: and wounded one an other, they beganne to seeke remedies to heale theire woundes. For they beleued that one man coulde cure the woundes that an other had geuen. But they supposed that other infirmities, and paynes of the inwarde partes as engendred thorowe the anger of the Goddes were not to be cured with naturall vertues. The first inuentoure then of Surgerie was Apis Kinge of Egypte, or as Clement of Alexandria of greate Noe. But Esculapius was the firste that wrote of Surgerye, Afterwarde Pythagoras, Empedocles, Parmenides, Democritus Chiron, & Peon in Rome was one Archagatus of Peloponesus, and that for, the crueltie of cuttinge and searinge, he was commonly called a wounde maker, and that the name passed afterwarde to executioner, and finally that men wared altogeather wery of the Arte and disanulled it. Surgerie then is famous for the authoritee of excellent men nolesse then if they were the doinges of other Phisitions, but infamous for the filthines of poysonous mattier and blouddy crueltee. Phisitions & Surgeans, wherby they haue with moste cruel tormentes dismembred the malefactours that were condemned to dye openly sometime aliue, and breathringe. But nowe a dayes become somewhat more gentle for the reuerence of Christian religion, firste slayinge the man with theire owne hands, or of the hangman. With this crueltee they afterwarde cut open the liueles bodye, and tearinge asunder mans bodye doo searche, and consider the placing, order, measure, worke, nature, and secretes of euery member, to learne thereby howe and in what places they shoulde cure with this cruell diligence nolesse wicked, then horrible and abhominable spectacle. There is moreouer an other practise of Phisicke that is called curinge of cattal or beastes, which healeth the diseases of brute beasts muche more certaine and profitable then the other, inuented, as it is sayde, by Chiron, moste woorthy writers. Yet these ringed Phisition doo not onely accompte it a shame for them, but also be altogeathr ignoraunte thereof and dispise thesame, they are very nice, and as it were the lapwinge be delited with nothing but mans ordure. Wherfore if any man aske them a medicine for his Asse, or Oxe, he shall immediately receiue displeasure in steede of a remedie: as ye it were their dutie not onely to cure men, but other liuing creatures also, especially them which be profitbale vnto menne, for whiche consideration Alphonsus Phisicke with great stipende, for horses and Dogges, and commaunded them that they shoulde with al diligence search, out what remedies, and what maner of curinge did agree to al the infirmities of beasts, which they doing, made a very profitable booke of these things. Iohn Ruel of Paris, did the like of late yeares a man very wellearned in bothe tonges, and a notable Philosopher, who gathered a piked volume of the diseases of Horses, and theire remedies, out of most auncient Authours, as Apsirchus, Hierocles, Theomestus, Pelagonius, Anatolius, Tiberius, Eumelius, Archedamus, Hippocrates, Hemerius, Africanus, and out of Emilius the Spaniard, and Litorius Bonauetanus, profitable to al horseleaches with the great commoditie of the common weale. That parte of Phisicke whiche cureth by diete, is yet remayninge, wherein Asclepiades before others was chiefe, who hauinge for the moste parte taken away the vse of receites, reduced the whole Arte of Phisicke, to the order of feeding, to the quantitee, and nature of meates, and to the seasoninge of them, from whom other Phisitions doo not altogeather disagree, but in this maner supposing that one standeth in neede of an other, feedinge sometimes of medicines, and the same likewise of the order and measure of feedinge: for this cause they commaunde, forbid, refuse, and blame meates & drinkes, whiche God hath created, & prescribe them rules of diete, not able to be obserued: and what meates they will not haue others to taste, themselues deuoure as pigges doo acornes: and the rules which they prescribe to others thci firste of al transgresse themselues not so muche of negligence as of a set pourpose. For if they were bound to liue accordinge to these theire dietinge decrees, they shoulde greatly empaire theire healthe: and if they permitted the diseased to liue according to the lawes of nature, as they liue, theire purse woulde feele the smarte therof. Of these dietes speaketh Ambrose in this manner: The preceptes of Phisicke are contrary to the diuine state, which drawe men backe from fastinge, they suffer men not to watch, they withdrawe men from settinge of the minde on meditation: and so he that putteth himselfe into the handes of the Phisition, abandoneth himself. And Barnarde writing vpon Cantica, saith: Hippocrates and Socrates teache to saue soules in this worlde: Christe and his disciples to destroie them, which Master of these twoo wil ye folowe? He maketh himself manifest that reasoneth, this hurteth the eyes, this the heade, this the stomake: all manner of pulse is windy, cheese oppresseth the stomake, milke hurteth the heade, the breast broketh not drinking of water: whereof this commeth to passe, that thou canste scarslye find any thing to eate in whole riuers, fields, gardens, & cellars. But put the case that these woordes of Ambrose & Bernarde be spoken to Monckes & to no men els, whiche peraduenture ought not to haue so great regarde of their health as of their profession: And it is not vnsitting, that ciuil men togeather with ye regarde of theire health should be delited also with varietye and daintines of fare, and meates, the firste Phisicke that cureth by diete doth promisse, the seconde Coquerie doth performe, whiche is the knowledge to dresse meates and drinckes. Wherefore Plato calleth this the flatteresse of Phisicke, and many accompte it part of dietinge Phisicke: albeit Plinie, Seneca, and the residewe of the schole of Phisitions doo confesse ye diuers diseases are engedred thorow the variette of deintie meates. Coquerie is very profitable, and honest, if so be that it passe not the bowndes of discreation. And this consideration also hath moued excellent and moste continent men, that they were not ashamed to write of Epiricus, Lophon, Egesippus, Pazamus, Epenetus, Heraclides the Syracusane, Tindaricus, the Syceonean, Symonactes of Chios, and Glancus, them of late yeares Platina. But the Asians were alwayes in these things so luxurious and intemperat, that their name passed into the surname of garmands & gluttons, which thereof we call Asotes: From hence as Titus Liuins recopteth, after the victorie of Asia foreine superfluitee entred into the citie of Rome: and it was the firste time that bakets began to be prepared with greater diligence and coste; then before: then the cooke whiche the auncientes helde for a moste vile slaue began to be esteemed, vsed and prised, and comminge out of the kitchin altogeather bathed in brothe, besmered with sotte, with pottes, platters, pestle, morter, and spit entreth into the scholes, and that which firste was auile seruice, began to be accompted an honourable Arte: all whose studie is to geate from all partes delicate dishes, and in all places to seeke out diuers kindes of meates to satisfie greedy gluttonie, many of which sorte Gellius reciteth out of Varro, that is to saie, the Pecocke of Samos, the Woodcocke of Phrigia, the Cranes of Malta, the Goate of Ambracia, the Tunie of Chalcedonia, the Lamprey of Tartesia, the Fifth Asinellus of Pessimus, the Oysters of Tarentum, the Scaloppe of Chios, the Fish of Helops of Rhodes, the chestens of Spaine, all which maners of eating haue ben founde out for the vnsatiable lasciuiousnes of excesse and superfluitee. Apicius more then all other haue vsurped ye glory and fame of this arte, that of his name (as Septimus Florus testifieth) with a certaine Philosophical imitation the surname of cookes is deriued, whereby they be called Apiciani, of him Seneca hath writen in this manner, saieing: Apicius liued since I could remeber, who publikely taught the science of cokerie in ye Citie out of which ones in time past Philosophers were comaunded to depart as corruptours of youth, & so with his doctrine he infected the world. Plinie also most sharply termeth it ye deapest goulf of prodigall parsons: Finally there were so many instrumentes of the throte, so many prouocations of luste, so many sortes of meates, that at the length it was needeful to bridle with lawes the pompe of the kitchin. For this cause those auncient lawes concerninge sumptuous fare were ordained: that is to sale, the law Archian, Fannian, Didian, Licinian, Cornelian, the lawe of Lepidus, the lawe of Antius Restio: but also Lucius Flaccus because being tribune of the people he wente about to fordoe a lawe whiche was made to cease the costes bestowed vpon bankettes, for Durionius very impudently wente vp into the pulpit to speake these woordes: The bridle is laide on you Citizens which in no wise is not to be endured, ye be bounde and tied in the bitter snare of bondage, for there is a lawe published that wideth you to be sparinge and sober: wherefore let vs disanull that gouernment couered with the ruste of vnpleasaunt oldnesse: for to what ende haue we libertie, if they whiche will, cannot spende their owne? There were also many other edictes all which be now abolished, & taken awaie: in so much that there was neuer any age that with greater pompe and excesse hath seed and cherished the carkeis then this our: by reason thereof (as Musonius saithe, and after him our Hierome) we trauaile both by sea & lande, and with the labour of all our life we take paines that Muscadell, Wine, and all pretiouse meate maie enter into our throte: there are so many vittailinge houses nowe a daies emonge vs, so many hosteries, so many tauernes of gluttons & queancs, where men are made vnthriftie thorow gourmandisinge, drunkennesse, and carnal pleasure, that oftentimes not without greate hinderaunce of the common weale they deuoure, and consume all theire liueloode so many kindes of dishes are founde out nowe a daies, so many sauces for meates, so many orders, rules, and ceremonies of tables, that the costliest bankettes of the Asians, Milesians, Syberitans, Tarentins, and beside this of Sardanapalus, Xerxes, Claudius, Tiberius, Vitellius, Heliogabalus, Galene, Emperours & others of those aunciet gluttons (al which as ye Historians declare passed other nations & men in delices, saperfluitee & pleasure of ye throte) shalbe altogeather vile, vnpleasant, & rusticall, if they be compared with these our prepartions of bankettes. Furthermore it semeth that nothinge is donne with the delicatenes of meate and drinke, except there be also so greate abundance that causeth lothesomnes, and which is enough to make Hercules drunken, who oftentimes was carried and dranke in one shippe, & with 221 Aurelian, the one of whiche was accustomed to eate a hundred loaues of breade beside other meates, the other deuoured in one date at the table of Aurelian the Emperour a whole Boore, a hundreth loaues of bread, a sheepe, and a rostinge pigge, and afterwarde dranke in a tunnel more then a Whale coulde haue drunken: these thinges are nowe a daies much vsed with vs in these vplandishe publike bankettes, and dedications of Churches, and other of their feastes, ye woulde saie that they offered sacrifice vnto Bacehus, all thinges are there in suche wise distained with furie, bloud and many mischieuous deedes of gourmandise and drunkennesse, ye may there see also the bankettes of the Centaures, from whom none departeth without a scarre, and excessiue eatinge, like to that whiche Ouide writeth of Erisisthon. Anon before him comes what euer liues in sea, in lande And aire, yet crieth he for more, and though the dishes stande Before his face full furnished yet doth he still complaine, Of hunger crauinge meate at meale, the foode that would sustaine VVhole housholdes, townships, Shyres & Realine suffice not him alone, The more his pampred panch consume the more it maketh mone. And as the sea receiues the brookes of all the earthly Realmes, And yet is neuer satisfied with all the foreine streames And as the fell and raueninge fiere refuseth neuer woode, But burneth faggottes numberlesse and with a furious moode. The more it hath the more it still desireth euermore, Encreasinge in deuouringe through encreasment of the store. So wicked Erisisthons mouth in swallowinge of his meate, VVas alwaies hungrie more and more and longed aie to eate: Meate tolde in meate, and as he ate his panche for more did freate. There were in time paste emonge the Greekes, & afterwarde emonge the Romanes wrastlers very greate eaters, but their infamie at the length was exceaded by noble men and Emperours: for Albinus who ones gouerned 222 the Realme of Fraunce, deuoured at one supper a hundreth Peaches, ten Pompons, fiue hudreth Figges, and three hundreth Oysters: and Maximinus daie fiftie pounde of fleshe, & dranke an Amphore of wine: which is a measure of vj. gallons. Geta the Emperour also is saide to haue ben of so vnhonest a life, that he commaunded incate to be brought accordinge to the order of the Alphabete, and for the space of three daies togeather he sate at the table eatinge. And moreouer (what offence is more wicked) whereas God and nature haue prouided vs meate and drinke for consideration of health and strength, we contrariwise abuse those diuerse dressinges of meates for pleasure, and we gluttonously deuoure more meate then our bodies are able to receaue, getting thereby incurable diseases, wherfore we plainly perceaue that to be true whiche Musonius saithe, the seruauntes more then the Masters, the countrey men more then the Citizens, the poore more then the riche, and al they which vse the grosest meates be harder, stronger, mightier, and better enduringe labours, & lesse weried, and very seldome sicke, neither is there any that is more greaued with these greate sicknesses, that is to sate, the Dropsie, the Goute, the Morphew, the Colicke, and suche like, then they which dispising comon fare liue by daintie meates, & contrariwise they whiche wee see content with simple fare be healthiest. With him also agreeth Cornelius Celsus, who saithe that meane fare is holesomest, the heapinge vp of tastes pestilent, and al sauced thinges are vnholsome for twoo causes, because more is consumed by reason of the sweetnesse, then is necessarie, and it is with more difficultie digested. Moreouer many men and very substanciall authours haue blamed these prouocations of gluttonie, and the artificial pleasure of meates, but there are some which vnder the name of Religion do not onely detest gourmandise and superfluitee, but also absteining from fleash doo blame some meates, which God hath created to be eaten: but they are able to drinke more wine then the Epicures, wherein (as the Apostle saith) is loxuriousnes, sayinge that they absteine and faste, when they haue filled themselues with all kinde of fishe, and with the beste wines, for whish they carrie about their lippes, their tongues, teeth & bellies armed, yet not their purses, but we haue sufficiently spoken hereof, wherefore let vs now passe from Cokerie to Adgeberica, that is, to the Alcumistes kitchin, which consumeth no lesse substance then the throte. Alcumie then whether it ought to be termed an Arte, or a counterfaite colouringe, or a pursuite of nature, is doubtlesse a notable and a suffered deceipte, the vanitee whereof is easely perceaued in this, that it promiseth the thinges whiche nature in nowise can abide, nor attaine, whereas not withstandinge no Arte can surmounte nature, but dothe imitate, and folowe it aloofe of, and the force of nature is farre stronger then of Arte. An Arte that good men doo mistrust an Arte of many hated. It causeth vsers of the Arte of all men to be hated. So many liers there appeare so many false are founde: That they do aie themselues beguile and others eke confounde. Whilest that thei go about to alter the kindes of things, and suppose to forge (as they saie) a certaine blessed stone of Philosophers, with the whiche like Midas all bodies touched, become sodainly Golde & Siluer: Moreouer they endeuoure to make a certaine quint essence to come downe from the high & inaccessible heauen, by the means wherof they promisse vs not only more riches then Cresus had, but also expellinge olde age do promisse vs youth and continual health, and almost immortalitee togeather with great substaunce. But yet emonge them all there is none founde, VVhich maketh proufe, and wonders greate in trewe eftect to sounde. But with some experimentes of Phisicke, with Ceruse, with read paintinge, with Stibium, & with Sope,  & suche like paintinges womanlike colours and smeeringe of old ruines: and such as the holy Scripture termeth, whoorish ointments: they gather vp monie to furnish their shoppe of Alcumie, Phisition or a Sope maker, they enriche with woordes the eares of men that lightly beleue, to the ende ye thei maie empte their purses. And to whom they promisse riches, of them they aske monie Hereby it is manifestly perceaued that this Arte is of no price, but to be great trifles, & vaine deuises of a peeuish minde. Notwithstandinge they finde men very desirous of so great felicitee, whom they with a marueilous witte perswade that they will get greater riches in Hydrargirie, then nature geueth in golde, and whom they haue alreadie deceaued three or fower times, they alwaies beguile againe vnawares with new slights: & through this monstruous trumperie they enforce them to blowe the fire at the fornace mouthe, & there is no sweeter madnes then to beleeue that a stedie thinge can be made to flee, and a fleeynge thing, stedie: so the warste cooles, sulphure, ordure, venims, & vrines, and euery harde paine is to you more pleasant then honie, vntil that after they haue consumed and turned into ashes all their possessions, marchaundise & patrimonie, whilest that they pleasauntly doo promisse rewardes of longe labour, Golde to growe, & perpetuall health with youth, when they haue a longe time spente their substaunce, then they beginne to ware olde, aged, poorely apparailed, hunger staruen, alwaies smellinge of sulphure, besmered with cooles, and paraliticke thorowe the continuall handlinge of quickesiluer, riche onely in the droppinge of theire nose, but as concerninge other thinges so miserable, that for three halfepence they will sell their soule, and that transformation that they goo aboute to make in mettals, they proue it in themselues, made now of Alcumistes, Cacochimickes of Phisitions, sewterers, of sopemakers, meate sellers, a laughinge stocke to the people, a manifest foolishnes, & a mate game to the multitude, and they that in their youth haue despised to liue in a meane estate, subiecte all their life time to the deceiptes of Alcumistes, being now waxen olde men are compelled to begge in great pouertie, and beinge in so great calamitee, in steede of fauour and mercy they receaue contempte, and skorne, oftentimes costrained thorowe pouertie doo degenerate to naughtie Artes, to couterfaite monie, and other falsifications, and therefore this Arte was not onely bannished by the ciuill lawes from the Romane publike weale, but also by the Canon decrees, was forbidden in all the Christian Churche. But if also at this daie al they which without ye singular graunt of the Prince doo exercise the Arte of Alcumie, were bannished out of the Realme & Prouinces, puttinge thereto the confiscation of their goodes, and the punishment of the bodie, doubtlesse we shoulde not haue so muche counterfeite monie, wherewith at this daie well neare al men are beguiled with the greate detrimente of the common wealthe. For this cause I suppose that Amasis in time paste kinge of Egypte made a lawe, whereby euery man was constrained to render an accompte to a Magistrate appointed for that purpose, with what handicrafte or occupation he mainteyned him selfe, and he that did not do it death was his punishment, I coulde saie moreouer very many things of this Arte, (yet not very much against me,) if I had not sworne, (as they are wonte to doo which receaue orders) to kepe silence. And this silence is so constantly, and religiously obserued of the auncient Philosophers and writers, that any where there is founde no Philosopher and faithfull writer of approued authoritee, that in any place hath with one woorde made mencion of this Arte: which thing hath induced many to beleue that al the bookes of that Arte were but of late yeares inuented, to the which opinion the obscure names, & vsed by no other, of Giber, Morienus, Gilgilis, and others of that sort purchase great credite, & also the vnapte termes of thinges which they vse, the grosnesse of sentence, and the corrupt manner of searchinge the causes and natures of thinges. Yet there are some whiche thinke that the skinne of the golden fleese was a booke of Alcumie writen vpo a skinne after the manner of the auncients, wherein was conteined the knowledge to make golde: as it is read that Dioclesian, when he had searched with great diligence, caused al the bookes of this sorte to be burned, which were emonge the Egyptians, which were said to haue bene most skilfull in this Arte: least that the Egyptians heapinge vp riches, and trusting in the aboundaunce of golde, mighte sometimes presume to make warre against the Romans, and that afterwarde this Arte was alwaies accompted mischieuous and forbidden by the publike edict of C aesar: but it should be ouer longe to recompte all the foolish misteries, & vaine riddles of this Arte, of the grene Lion, of the fugitiue Harte, of the fleeing Egle, of the daunsing foole, of the Dragon deuouringe his taile, of the swollen foode, of the crowes head, and of that blacke, whiche is blacker then blacke, of the seale of Hermes, of the dirte of foolishnes, (of wisdome I should saie) & of infinite like trifles: Finally, of ye onely blessed thing alone, besides which there is no other thinge, yet to be founde in euery place, the subiecte of the most holy stone of the Philosophers, I 223 meane, ye is to saie, I haue almost rashly vttered the name of the thing, wherby I should be a sacrilege & forsworne, yet I will speake it with circumlocution, but somewhat more obscure, that none but yoge beginners in the Arte, & they which be trained vp in the mysteries thereof, maie vnderstande it. It is a thinge, whiche hath substaunce, & not ouermuch fierie, nor altogeather earthly, not simplie warrie, nor a moste sharpe, nor most sharpe, not most blunte qualitee, but indifferent, and light in touchinge, & after a sorte tender, or at the least not harde, not vnpleasant, but after a sorte sweete in taste, soote in smell, delectable to the sight, pleasant and iocunde to the hyringe, large to the imaginatio: I maie say no more, & yet there be thinges greater then these: but I deeme this Arte (for the familiaritee whiche I haue with it) especially woorthie of ye honour, with which Thucidides defineth and honest woman, sayinge that shee is beste, of whose praise or dispraise there is very litle comunication. This onely I will saie, that the Alcumistes be of all men the naughtiest, for wheras God commaundeth that man should eate breade with the sweate of his browes, and in an other place he speaketh by ye Prophet, thou arte blessed, and shalt prosper because thou shalt liue by the labour of thy handes, these men beinge despisers of Gods commaundement, & of the promised blessednes, farre from labour, and (as it is sayde in womens worke, and in boyes pastime they go about to make mountaines of golde. I doo not denie that of this Arte many most excellente workemanshippes had theire beginninge. From hence came the temperatures of Asure, of Cinnaber of Sinople, of Purple, and of that whiche they call musicall golde, and of other coloures, we are bounde to this Arte for latten mettall, for the mixtions of all mettals, for the factninges of them togeather, for the tryings of them, and for their separations, the inuentions of the gunne a fearful instrument belongeth to this Art, from this came the moste noble Arte of glasse makinge, whereof one Theophilus hath writen a very goodly booke. And Plinie glasse was inuented, whereby it was made softe, and flexible, but thereof the shop was abolished by Tiberius, and also that the Artificer of so greate an industrie (if Isidorus be credible) was put to deathe, and that was done, leaste that golde shoulde be lesse esteemed then glasse, and that siluer and brasse shoulde not be esteemed as they were before. But of these thinges we haue sufficiently spoken. auaunteth ye shee alone knoweth to make difference betweene true  & false, iuste & vniuste, honest and dishonest, of which facultie at this day the Pope and the Emperoure be chiefe heades and rulars, which boste that they haue al the Lawes layd vp in the cheste of their breste, to whom wil alone serueth for Lawe, with the arbitermente whereof they presume to iudge and rule all Sciences, Artes, Scriptures, Opinions, and the woorkes of men whatsoeuee they be. For this cause  Leo the Pope straightly commaunded all Christian people, that noma in ye Church of God should presume to iudge any thinge, nor any man, to iustifie, nor to discusse any matter: but by the Authoritee of the holy Counsailes, Canons, and Decretals, whose heade is the Pope: and also that we cannot vse the determination of the beste learned menne, of all the holiest deuines, but so farre foorthe as the Pope dothe permit, & shall authorise by his Canons: And in an other place the Canon dothe forbidde, that no other volume or booke be receiued by the deuines (yea thorow out ye whole worlde saith he) but the same, which is allowed throughout the Romishe Churche by the Canons of the Pope? The like Lawe the Emperoure pretendeth to haue in Philosophie, Phisicke, and other sciences, grauntinge no authoritee to any knowledge, but so muche as is geuen them by the skilfulnes of the Law, wherunto (as he saith) if all Sciences and Artes that are, be compared, they are all vile & vnprofitable. For this cause Vlpiane saithe: the Lawe is King of al things bothe humane and diuine, whose vertue is (as Modestine graunt, to punish, to forbid, the whiche dignitees there is founde no office more great: and Pomponius in ye Lawes defineth, that it is the gift and inuention of God, and the determination of all wise men: bicause these aunciente Lawe makers, to the end they might purchase authoritee by theire decrees emonge the ignoraunte people, they made semblante that they did as they were taught by the Gods. So made Osiris the Egyptians beleue that he receiued them of Mercurie, Zoroastes the Bactrians, & Persians Athenians of Minerua, Zantrastates the Arimaspians, of a good deuine power, Zamolxis the Scythians of Vesta, Minos the Cretensians this knowledge of the Lawe presumeth to beare swaye ouer all other Artes, and exerciseth tyrannie, and howe preferringe it selfe before all other disciplines as it were the first begotten of the Gods doth despise them as vile and vaine, although it be altogeather made of nothinge els but of fraile and very weake inuentions and opinios of me, which things be of all other the weakest, and is altered at euerye chaunge of time, of the State, and of the Prince, whiche tooke firste beginninge of the sinne of our firste parent, whiche was cause of all our miseries, From whence the first Lawe of corrupt nature proceeded which they terme the Lawe of nature, whose notable decrees are these: It is leefull to resiste force with force, he that beaketh promisse with thee, breake thou promisse with him, It is no deccipte to dcceiue him that deceiueth. A gileful parson is not boud to a gileful parson in nothing. Blame with blame may be requited. Malefactours ought not to reioyce of iustice nor faithfulnes Iniurie is not donne to him that is willinge. It is leefull for them that trasicke to deceiue one an other. The thinge is so muche worthy as it maye be solde for. It is leefull for a man to prouide for himselfe with the losse of an other. Noman is bounde to an impossible thinge. When it must needes bee that I, or thou be confounded, I will chuse rather that thou be confounded then I. And many such like thinges, whiche afterwarde were writen emong the Lawes. Finally the Lawe of nature is that wee shoulde not dye for thirste, for hunger, for colde, and not to hurte our selues with watchinges, and laboure. Whiche abandoninge all the repentaunce of Religion, and the workes of repentaunce, dothe appointe the pleasure of the Epicure for the chiefest felicitie, Afterwarde the Lawe of Nations arose from whence warre, murder, bondage were deriued, & dominions separated. After this came the Ciuill or Populare Lawe, whiche any people maketh peculiare to himselfe: from whence haue growen so many debates emonge menne, that as the lawes doo witnes, there haue ben made more businesses, the there be names of things, For whereas men were prone and enclined to discorde, the publishinge of iustice whiche was to be obserued by meanes of the Lawes was a necessarie thinge: to the end that the boldenes of naughty men might in suche wise be bridled: and emong the wicked innocencie might be salfe, and the honest might liue quietly emonge the dishoneste. And these be that same so notable beginninges of the Lawe, wherein there haue benne almoste innumerable Lawemakers: Of which Moses was the first, who wrote Lawes to the Iewes, at the very same time that Cecrops gaue Lawes to the Egyptians: Pheroneus after these was the firste, that gaue Lawes to the Gretains: after him Mercurie. Trismegiste gaue Lawes to ye Egyptians, afterwarde Dracon Palameds was the firste, that made Lawes of warre, to iudge an hoste. Romulus was the firste that gaue Lawes to the Romaines, whiche were called Curiatee. After whome Numa Pompilius made Lawes of Religions, and other Kinges of the Romaines by succession made theire Lawes, all whiche were afterwarde writen in the booke of Papyrius, from whence the Ciuill Lawe of Papyrius tooke name, after these the Law of the iij Tables came abroade, In like manner the Law of Flauian, the Lawe of Helian, the Lawe of Hortensius and the Law of Honorarius of the pretor. Moreouer there were made the decrees of the people, the decrees of the senate, the Lawe of Magistrates and custome, and finally al the authoritee geuen to the Prince to appoint Lawes: I will not speake of those innumerable Lawiers the most parte of whiche are written in the seconde Lawe, De origine iuris. They whiche haue gonne aboute to bringe the Ciuill Lawe into one volume, of these C. Pompeius did firste attempte this, afterwarde Caius C aesar, but bothe preuented by the Ciuill warres and vntimly death could not atcheiue theire purpose. At the length Constantine renewed all those aunciente Lawes, and Theodosius the younger reduced them into a booke called after his name: lastly Iustinian made the Code whiche at this daye is in vse. All the authoritee of the Ciuill Lawe is in the people, and in the Prince: and the Ciuill Lawe is nothinge els but that which men will doo with a common consent. For 224 but that they haue ben approued by ye iudgemente of the people, whiche with a common consent hath transferred all Empire and power to the Prince: wherefore if any thinge please the people and the Prince, this then standeth in force bothe by custome and ordinaunces of the Lawe, although there appeare erroure or falset, for common erroure maketh Lawe, and the matter iudged, trouth Whiche Vlpiane hath taught vs in these woords, to weet, that he ought to be taken for a free man of whom sentence hathe benne geuen, although in effecte he be a libertine, that is, of a bonde man made free, because the matter iudged is taken for truthe. The same also saithe that one Philip a Barbarion, who ran from his mauster, demaunded at Rome the Pretourshippe, the whiche he administred, & at length was knowe, it was iudged thae none of those thinges shoulde be altered, which he being a seruaunt did in the couering of so great a dignitee. And in an other place an olde man of the countrie for the authoritee of the Emperour is so much woorshipped, that the lawier woulde that men should at gue with his woordes. Paulus also ye best learned in the Lawe of them that were emonge the Romaines saithe that at this day, for the vse of Emperoures, if a candlesticke of siluer be reckoned emonge: siluer, that it is vnderstoode siluer, and not housholde stuffe, because erroure maketh Lawe. The same he openly confesseth of the Lawes and decrees of the senate, that a reason cannot be geuen of all thinges, which haue benne ordained by our elders. Hereof then we knowe that al the knowledge of the Ciuill Lawe depedeth vpon the onely opinion and will of menne, without any other reason brginge and enforcinge to be so, then either the honestie of manners, or commoditie of liuinge, or the authoritee of the Prince, or the force of armes, whiche if it be the preserueresse of good menne, and the reuengercsse of wicked men, it is a good discipline, finally it is a moste wicked thinge for the naughtinesse whiche is done when the Magistrate or the Prince neglecteth it, suffereth it, or alloweth it. But that more is, the opinion of Demonactes was that all Lawes were vnprofitable and superfluous as they which were not made neither for good, nor ill menne, for asmuche as they haue no neede of Lawes, and these be made neuer the better for them. Furthermore Cato confesseth in Liuie that vneth any Lawe can be made, whiche to all menne maye be profitable and in ye whiche very often it doth not happen that equitee fighteth with the rigour of the Lawe: Aristotle also defining equitee, calleth it the correction of a righteous Lawe, in whiche pointe he faileth, becauss it is made generally. Is it not then sufficiently declared by this alone, that all the force of the Law & Iustice doth not so much depend vpon the Lawes as vpon the honestie and equitie of ye Iudge? From the ciuill Lawe proceeded the Canon or the Popes Law, which to many may appeare most holy, so wittily it doth shadow ye precepts of couetousnes, and manners of robbinge vnder the coloure of godlines. Albeit there be very fewe things therin ordained apperteyninge to godlines, to religion, to the woorshipping of God, and to the solemnitee of the Sacraments. I will not speake of some which are contrary & repugnaunte to the woord of God. Al the residue are nothing but cotentions, stiffes, pride, pompe, meanes to gaine and get, and ye decrees of the Popes of Rome, to whom the Canons be not sufficient, which were in time passed made by the holy fathers, except they continually adde to them new decrees, strawes, extrauagants, declaratios, and rules of chauncery, so that there is no ende nor measure of making Canons, which alone is the ambition & desire of the Bishops of Rome that is to say, to make newe Canons, whose arrogancie is growen so farre, that they haue commaunded the Angels of heauen, & haue presumed to robbe & bringe their bootie out of hel and to put in thier hand emong the sprites of the deade: & on the Lawe of God, also they haue sometimes exercised their tyrannie, interpretinge, declaring, & disputinge: to the ende that nothinge might want or be derogated from the greatnes of his power. Is it not 225 in Vienna, in Lemosin, & in Poitiers, in the coffers of priuileges, commaundeth the Angles of heaue, that they shoulde bringe into euerlasting ioyes the soule of him that vseth to go in pilgrimage to Rome for indulgences, & there dying, beinge deliuered out of the paynes of purgatory? sayinge moreouer: we will not in any wise that he go to the paynes of hell: grauntinge also to them that be figned with the crosse, that aat theire prayers they maye take three or foure soules out of purgatorye whiche they liste, which erroneous & intolerable temeritee, I wil not say heresie, the schole of Paris did then openly detest & reproue, but peraduenture repenting at this day, ye thei had not interpreted that Hyperbolicall zeale of Clement with some godly inuention, that the thinge might rather florishe then perish, seinge that for their affirming or denyinge, nothing is altered in the deede & authorisee of the Pope, whose Canons & decrees haue in such sorte bounde al diuinitee, that no diuine be he neuer so contentious dareth to determine, no not imagine, or dispute any thinge contrarie to the Popes Canons without protestatio and leaue, as Martial singeth of Rufus: VVhat euer Rufus faithe he pardon doth obtaine, If laugh he do, if weepe, if speake, if tongue reframe, If suppe he do, affirme denie, aske, all is one, If he be not forgeuen, his tongue will quite be gone. Furthermore we haue learned out of their Canons, and decrees, that the patrimonie of Christe is Kinge domes, Castles, Donations, Fundations, Riches, & possessions, and that empire and tule, belongeth to the Priostes of Christe, and to the Prelates of the Churche, & that iurisdiction, & temporal power is the sword of christ, and that the Person of the Pope is the rocke beinge the foundatio of the Churche, that the Bishops are not onely the Ministers, of the Churche, but also heades of the Churche, and that the euangelicke doctrine, the seruencte of faithe the contempte of the worlde are not onely the goodes of the Church, but reuenewes, tenthes, offeringes, collections, purple, miters, golde, siluer, pearle, possestions, & monie: and that the authoritee of the Pope is to make warces, to breake truce, to breake othes, & assoile from obedionce, & of the house of prater to make a den of theeues, & so the Pope can depose a Bishop without cause, ye he can geue that whiche is an other mans, that he cannot commit symony, that he cannot dispence against his vowe, against his othe, against the Lawe of nature, and none may saye vnto him, why doest thou this & also that he can as they say for some greeuous cause dispence againste al the new Testamente, and to drawe not onely the thirde part, but also the soules of the faithfull into hell. That the dutie of Bishops in not nowe as it was in time past to preach the woorde of God, but with buffets to confirme childerne, to geue orders, to dedicate Churches, to Baptise belles, to hallowe Aulters, and Chalices, to blesse Uestmentes and Images, whiche esteeme theire wittes more meete for higher matters, & leauing ye charge to certaine Bishops, which haue nothing els but the title, goo in ambassade to Kinges: they be presidentes of their Oratories: or attend vpon Queenes: excused for a sufficient great, & waightie cause not serue God in Churches, so that they royally honour the Kinge in the Courte. Herof these cautles toke their beginninges, by meanes whereof at this daie without simonie Bishoprickes, and Benefices, be bought and solde, and moreouer what faires and markets soeuer be in pardons, grauntes, indulgences, dispensations, & such like manners fo robbertes, by whom also there is a price set in the free remissions of sinnes geuen by God, & there is founde a meane to gaine by the punsihmentes of Hell. Furthermore that false donation of Constantine proceeded from this lawe, albeit in effect, & with the testimonie of Gods woorde, Caesar cannot leaue his charge, neither the parson of the Clergie ought to vsurpe the thinges that belonge to C aesar, but of infinite lawes of ambition, of pride, & of tirannie: I will onely declare vnto you some, that purchase credence to them, whiche I haue alreadie mentioned: Searche out therefore, if ye please in the auncient Decretals, Si summvs pontifix de sententia excomunie the cap Inter coetera de officiudi ordi. Boniface the eight, and looke what he saith in the Prologue, and in the first chapiter De immunitate Ecclesiarum, neither dothe that moste arrogant lawe of Clement: Pastoralis de senten  & re iudicata, with the extrauagant of Iohn the xxij. whiche beginneth, Ecclesi ae Romanae, and an other of the same vpon nations. And the extrauagante of Boniface the eight, Vnam Sanctam. Finally of the compilatio of Gration come to my minde, the Cap. Si cuius distin. 14. the cap. Si omnis dist. 18. the cap. Src omnes the cap. Enumero, the cap. In memoriam, the cap. St Romanorum dist. 19. the cap. Omnes dist. 22. the ca. libi domino dist 60. the ca. Constantinus dist. 96. the cap. Quando dist. 86. with the Glose thereupon, the cap. Si. Papa dist. 60. There are moreouer beside these, the cap Cuncta. 9. q. 3. the cap. Conquestus 15. q. 6 the cap. Sunt qui. 23. q. 5. omnium  & q.8 the cap. Omni. 30. q. 1. cap. Omnia. He that will diligently examine these canons, & others like, shal perceaue what these great, marueilous, and hidden misteries are, which some Popes of Rome do fruactfie in theire Canons, turninge also the thinges whiche are spoken els where in othe holy Scriptures, and sometimes counterfaitinge them, and with these their deuises likening & applyinge them. Fro hence sprange those Concordances (as they terme them) of the Bible, and of the Canons. Moreouer then this so many titles of robberies,of clokes of indulgences, of bulles, of confessionals, of pardons, of rescriptes, of testamentes, of dispensations, of priuileges, of elections, of dignities, of prebendes, of houses, of holy Churches, of liberties, of the place of iudgement, of iudgements, and of such other like thinges, finally the whole Canon Lawe is of all the most inconstaunt, & more mutable then the Chameleon, and more intricate then Gordiane Knotte, and that same Christian Religion, at the beginninge whereof Christe toke awaie ceremonies, hath nowe more then ever the Iewes had,the paise of which being put thereto, the light & sweete yoke of Christe is become much more greauous then all the reste, and the Christians are enforced to liue rather after the order of the Canons, then after the Gosple. The whole knowledge of bothe Lawes is occupled aboute nothinge but transitorie, fraile, flitinge, and vaine thinges, worldly affaires, entercourses, eumittes of the comons, aboute the murders of men, robbertes, theftes, spoiles, faction, cospiracics, wronges, and treasons. Moreouer then this periuries of witnesses, falsifications of Notaries, collusions of Aouocates, corruptions of iudges, ambitions of counsailours, rauenies of presidentes by whome widowes are oppicssed, pupilles vndoone, good men euiled, poore men troden vnder foote, innocentes condemned, and as Iuuenall saithe: The crowes vnharmed scape, the doues be vexed fore. And blinde men haue altogeather prepared for them, selurs, & incurred those thinges which thei hauethought to mselues able to eschewe we by the meanes of the Lawes and Canons, because these Lawes and Canons come not from God, nor be addressed to God: but are deriued from the corr upte nature and witte of men, and are inuented for gaine and couetousnesse. There is yet an other exercise of the lawe, whiche they terme the Arte Placitatorie, or els Aducatorie, as they saie, very necessarie, a moste auncient Arte, and full of deceiptes, craftely se out with a colour of perswation. Whiche is nothing els, but to know how to entreate the iudge gentlely with perswation, and to know howe to vse the lawes at theire fantasie, at els inuentinge Gloses, and commentaries, to make & vnmake all lawes accordinge to their pleasure, or to auoide them with all manner of subtill slightes, or to prolonge a deeciptful cotrouersie. To alledge the Lawes in such wise, that eq itee turned tops tturaie, to entangle the authoritee of the glossers in suche sorte, that the meaninge of the lawe, & the minde of the lawemaker is subuerted. To crie out with a loude voice, to be shamelesse, presumptuous, and clamorous and obstinate in pleadinge is in 226 this Arte of greate importaunce. And he is accompted the beste Aduocate, which allureth most to variaunce, & puttinge them in hope to ouercome, perswadeth them to goe to lawe, and incenseth them with wicked counsailes, which seeketh for appeales, whiche is a notable tangler, & authour of variaunces, whiche with the bablinge & force of his tongue can prate of euery thinge, & also can make one cause better then an other with the conucighaunces of iudgementes, and by this meane to make true & rightous thinges appeare doubtfull & naught, and with theire armes to vannishe, destroie, and ouerthrow iustice, with whome: Nought els is Iustice but a publike meede, The lawe is solde, whiles golde the iudge doth feede. But the thinges also which are not, that is to witte, the finall ende ot thinges and silence, they sell for monie, for as none of them speaketh without his see, so he holdeth not his peace without rewarde, after the example, as I thinke, of Demosthenes, who when he had demaunded Aristodemus a maker of Enterludes, howe muche he had receaued for playinge in an Enterlude, he answeared a talente: but I saide Demosthenes haue receaued more to hold my peace. Ftor the tongue of pleaders is so damageable, that if it be not bounde with giftes, it cannot be chosen but that it will hurte. Net vnto these the Proctoures and Notaries come in place, whiche they terme Tabelliones, all whose iniuries, damages, naughtines, & falsetes we must pattently suffer, forsomuche as they seeme to haue gotten credite, licence and power to doo all thinges thorow the Apostolike and imperiall authoritee. And emonge them they be the chiefest, which know beste to trouble the place of iudgement, to cause cotrouersies, to cofounde causes, to forge false willes, obligations, supplications, and writes, to know also excellently to deceaue, beguile and when it is needefull to forsweare, & write false. To dare to doo all mischiefes, and suffer not themselues to be ouercome by any in imagininge deceiptes, wiles, craftes, malitious altercations, snares, entrappinges, subtill practises, encombrances, controuersies, circunuentions, Scylles, they terme it, but that it is necessarie to goo to lawe a freshe, if any aduersarie will goe aboute to disanull thesame. For he will saie either that there is some thing lefte out, or that there is falset, or deceipte, or els he will laie some other exceptio, to impugna the credite of the writinge, or notarie. And these be ye remedies of the lawe, whereunto they teache contentious parsons to flee: these by the watches, vnto whiche, they saie, that the lawe geueth succour, excepte there be some that had lieffer fight then striue. For he shall haue so much lawe, as with his power he shalbe able to defende, wherefore the lawe saithe: that we cannot resiste them that be stronger then vs. Hither doo these moste Huge Giauntes also looke, which contrarie to the ordinance of Iustinian haue made so many great and infinite volumes of Gloses, commentaries, and expositions, euery of them interpretinge diuersly one from an other. Furthermore they haue brought foorth with moste vnhappy fruitfulnesse so many stormes of opinions, and so many annotations of moste subtill counsailes, and cautels, with whiche the naughty practises of Aduocates are instrctued and maintayned: whiche do so muche vinde theire reputation with the famous memorte of those Lawiers thorow euery periode, and (as they terme them) Paragraphes, as though the veritee consisteth not rather in reasons, then in confused testimonies drawen out of the vile multitude of very obstinate and trislinge parsons, emonge whome is so much deceipte, wrangling, and discorde, that he which disagreeth not from others: he that knoweth not how to gainesaie other mens woordes with newe opinions, and bringe all apparante thinges in doubte, and with doubtfull expositions to applie well inuented Lawes to theire deduises, is accompted little or nothing learned. For this cause all the knowledge of the Lawe is become a naughtie counsaile and a deceiptfull nette of iniquitee: these be the polices, these be the Artes, with whiche at this daie Christendome is gouerned, with which Empires, Kingdomes, and Soueraintees of the People be established: and of these Knaues there be chosen Officiales, Senatoures, and Presidentes of the Parlamentes of Kinges and Princes, as if they whiche haue bene hitherto vnrighteous Aduocates, shoulde be better Iudges, & in the ende suche these are become head rulers of Realmes. These also be to be dread of their Kinges, as in time Past Titanes were of Iupiter. Finally from them come these gor bellied Chauncelloures of Emperours and Kinges, and these Secretaries clad in Purple, to whom all matters of waight be committed: which sell and compell men to buy of them al things, placardes of the Prince, giftes, benefices, offices, dignitees, letters of the Prince, and writes, moreeuer righte, iustice lawe, equitee, and honestie. Accordinge to whose iudgment the friendes and enemies of Kinges be reckened, with whome accordinge to their pleasure they sometimes make league, and somtime make mortall warre. And when they from moste base estate, by meanes of a most couetous selling of their voice, haue climbed to so highe degree of dignitee, they haue there withal such a mischieuous boldnes, that sometime they dare condemme Princes, and without the determination of the counsaile, and without declaring the cause do condemne them to die: & thus they be authoures of chaunginge the states in Kingdomes, they in the meane season beinge pussed vp with pride through theire robberies, and theeueries. Unto this companie also belonge the Inquisitoures of Heretickes. of the order of preachinge Freers, al whose iurisdictio although it ought to be grounded vpon deuine doctrine & the holy Scriptures, yet they doo moste cruelly exercise all this Arte accordinge to the Canon Lawe, and decrees of the Popes, as if it were impossible that the Pope should erre, neglectinge the Holy Scripture as it were a deade letter, and shadowe of the truthe: and whiche is more, as they saie, doo caste it farre of as the shielde and rampire of Heretickes. Neither doo they alowe the Traditions of auncient Doctoures & Fathers, sayinge, that they maie be deceaued and deceaue, but they doo geue leauell to the Churche of Rome alone, which, as they saie, cannot erre, whose head is the Pope, and to the stile of the Romishe Churche, as to the marke of faithe, demaundinge nothinge els, when they make Inquisition, but that the offender beleue in the Churche 227 of Rome: whiche if the shall affirme, foorthwith they saie, the Church of Rome condemneth this proposition either hereticall, or sinnefull, or offensiue to godly eares, or derogatiue from the Ecclesiasticall authoritee, and immediatly they campel him to recante and reuoke that which he hath spoken. But if the parson for whom Inquisition is made, doo than goe aboute to defende his opinion with testimonies of the Scripture, or with other reasons, interruptinge him with greate noyse and angrie checkes they saie, that the hath not to doo with bachelours, & scholers in the chayre, but with Iudges, in the iudgemente seate, that there he maie not striue and dispute, but must answeare plainely, if he will stande to the decree of the Churche of Rome, and to reuoke his opinion, if not, they shewe him fagttes & fire, sayinge, that with Heretickes they may not contende with arguments and Scripture, but with fagottes and fire, and enforce the man not connicted of any obstniacie, nor taught better doctrine to denie by othe his opinions againste his conscience, and if he will not doo it, they deliuer him into the handes of the temporall iudge to be burned, sayinge with the Apostle: Take awaie mischiefe from emong you, so great in time 228 paste was the gentlenesse of the Churche, & the clemencie of the Bishoppes, as Gratian hath writen in the fourth distinction of Consecration, that they did not put them to deathe whiche fell againe to Iudaisme, nor punisshed blasphemers: and Berengarius fallinge againe to abominable Heresie, was not onely not put to death, but also not depriued of the dignitee of an Archedeacon. But nowe a dayes he that hathe fallen into a very little errour, is condemned more then to deathe, and sometimes for euery small offence is by these inquisitours deliuered to be burned: peraduenture this seuere punishmet is necessary and profitable to the Church, so that in the meane while, brotherly loue faile not, the inquisitours of heresy are sometime wicked themselues, and may be heretickes, whiche thinge gaue occasion to Clement to make a newe decree, inquisitours then ought to dispute againste heretickes not by darke arguments, & brawling sillogismes, but by the woorde of God vpon the Catholike saithe, and to conuince an hereticke by the holy Scriptures, afterwarde accordinge to the instructions of the Canons, and the constitutions of the holy counsailes to ende the matter, and to bring him for whom Inquisition was made to the Catholike saithe, or to declare him an hereticke for he is not an hereticke which is not vnaduised, nor he ought to be called a maintainer of Heretickes, which desendeth a man voyde of offence, and not condemned of Heresie, ye he be not deliuered to be rente in peeces before the iudgemet seate of corrupt inquisitours, yea rather of rauening Woulfes, and into a daungerous place. And albeit it be expressely prouided by the Lawe that the Inquisitoures haue no power, nor any iurisdiction to proceede vpon any suspition of Heresi, defence, receipte, or fauoure, where & when it is not manifestly knowne, that there is expresse Heresie & euidently condemned, notwithstandinge these bloudthirsting vultures,beyod the priuiledges of the office of inquisitio to them graunted, against the Lawes & Canons do intermedle with ye iurisdiction of ordinaries, vsurping the authoritee of Bishops vpon such thinges as are not heretical, but onely displeasaunte to godly eares, or sinful, or in some other maner erroneous about Heresie, & do shew most cruel rigour towardes to poore wome of ye cuntrie, which being accused do appeached of witchecrafte, or sorcerie, oftentimes without any leefull iudgements foreknowen, are by them put to cruel and terrible tormentes, vntill that they be enforced to comfesse that they neuer thought, they maye haue wherewith to condemne them, and then truly they suppose that they do the partes of Inquisitours, when they cease not from theire duty, vntil that the sely woman be burned, or hath gilted the Inquisitours hande, wherefore he taketh pity on her, & deliuereth her as sufficiently purged by tormentes: for oftentimes the Inquisitour can chaunge the payne of the body into the punishment of the purse, and apply it to his office of inquisition, wherof there groweth vnto them no small gaine, and they haue not a few of these sely women that are constrayned to pay them a verely pension, to the ende they maye not be againe punished. Furthermore when the goodes of Heretickes be confiscated, the Inquisitoure thereby getteth no smal praye, and finally the ouely accusation, denuntiation, or suspicion of Heresse or sorcerie be it neuer so light, and the citation of the Inquisitoure bringe infamie with it, whose honestie is not saued, excepte monie be geuen to the Inquisitoure, and yet this is some staine. With this cautel I remember whilest I was in Italic, manye Inquisitoures in the Duchie of Milan troubled many moste honest Matrones, and these of the nobleste in the countrie, & preuily got muche mony of the fearfull and affrayed women. At length when the deceipte was discouered, they were greeuously punished, and scarsly escaped the blocke and the fire. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) I could recit to you in this place that moste subtil, and more them  Scotisticall inuention of that famous Hoochstrat, all that Tragedie of Capnion, and the warre of ten yeares, in the whiche all the name, reputation, and doctrine of our Masters of Coleine receiued remedeles damage, if these this were not very wel knowen to al men, and with the triumphe of Capnion the Historie were not cleare to ye time to come.![](/images/inline/ast.gif) I had in time past, whe I was Aduocate, and Counselour of the common wealth of  Mediomatrix, a very greeuous contention with an Inquisitour, who beinge a wicked man drewe a poore woman of the countrie, for certaine vaine, and moste vniust accusations to his bocherie, and to an vnifit place, not so muche to examine her as to tormente her: when I had taken in hand to defende her, and had declared, that in the things donne there was no signe or token, that coulde cause her to be tormented, he stoutly denyinge it sayde, one thinge there is whiche is sufficient enough, for her mother was in time paste burned for a witche, nowe when I replied and gaue him to vnderstand that this article was impertinente, and that in ought also to be refused by the office of the iudge for so muche as it was the deede of an other alleaging to him reason & Lawes for the same, sodeinly he replied againste me, leaste he mighte seeme to haue spoken vndiscreatly, he vouched a reason out of the moste secret places of the mallet of witches, & out of the groundes of Peripateticke Thealogie, saying, that this was true because witches were accustomed to sacrifice their childern to the deuil assone as they be borne, and also because many times they were wonte to conceiue by spirites transformed into the shape of a man, whereof it commeth to passe that the naughtinesse is deepe rooted in this childe, like a disease, that commeth by inheritaunce, I then sayd vnto him, O wicked father doest thou studye diuinitee in this fort; doest thou with these forged deuises draw poore giltles women to the racke; doest thou with these deceitfull senteces iudge others to be Heretickes, thou thy self with this opinion being not inferiour to the Heretickes Faustus and Donatus? be it as thou sayest, doest thou not make the grace of baptisme vaine; and the Prieste shall say in vaine, departe thou vncleane sprite, geue place to the holy ghoste, if the childe for the sacrifice of the wicked mother shoulde remaine in the power of the Deuill: And also if thou wilte defende theire opinions, whiche confesse that the spirites whiche accompanie with women ca engender, certes none of them, that affirme this, hath at any time so much doted, that be beleued that those deuils togeather with the stollen seade do put parte of theire nature in the creature, but yet I wil tel thee (sayde I) accordinge to our beleefe: that by the proper nature of our humanitee we are all borne of one masse of sinne and euerlastinge curse, childern of perdition, childern of the deuil, childern of Gods displeasure, and inheritoures of hel: but thorowe the grace of baptisme Satan in caste out of vs, & we are made a new creature in Iesus Christ, from whom none can be separated but by his owne sinne, muche lesse an others deede can endamage him. Nowe thou seest how sufficient this iudgemente is, not grounded vpon Lawe, voyde of reason, and hereticall in vouchinge: the cruel hipocrite at these woordes was very angrie, and manaced that he woulde proceede against me, as a supporter of heretickes: but I ceased not to defende that sely soule, and finally thorowe power of the lawe I deliuered her salfe from the mouthe of that Lion, & so that blouddy Moncke stoode ashamed in the presence of al menne, and by reason of his crueltee foreuer infamous, and not onely he but also the vniuste accusers whiche defamed the woman were condemned in a great some of mony to the chapter of the Churche of Mentz, whose subiectes they were. Lastly resteth to speake of Diuinitee. But I wil let passe the Diuinitee of the getils, writen in time past by Museus, Orpheus, and Hesiodus, the whiche, it is manifest, that it is altogeather poeticall and fabulous: Eusebius, Lactantius and other Christian Doctoures haue ouerthrowen this long sence with very stronge reasons, neither will I speake of that of Plato and other Philosophers all which we haue shewed before to be the masters of erroures. But in this place my communication shalbe onely of Christian diuinitee: it is certaine that this dependeth vpon nothinge, but the beleefe of the teachers therof, for so much as it cannot chaunce vnder any Arte. But let vs speake firste of Scolasticall Diuinitee, whiche doctrine was firste made by the Sorbonistes of Paris, with a certaine mixture of Goddes woorde, and Philosophicall reasons, facioned like twoo bodyes, as if it were of the Centaures kinde. Moreouer also it is writen with a certaine newe kinde of teachinge contrary to the vse of the auncientes, by briefe questions, and subtill Syllogismes without any eloquence, notwithstandinge otherwise very ful of iudgement, and vnderstanding, the authors thereof, and they whiche excelled therein, were the Maieter of the sentences, Thomas Aquians, Albert surnamed vnderstandinge, but ouermuche enclined to contention. Hereupon Scholastical Diuinitee in the end by little and little was turned to Sophismes, whilest ye these deuine Sophisters of latter time, and Hukesters of Gods woord, whiche be not deuines excepte the title be bought, of so high a Science they haue made a certaine Logomachie, that is, an vndiscreate altercation, goinge from schole to schole, mouinge questious, forging opinions, and worng the Scriptures with intricate woordes geuinge them a contrarie sence, redier craftly to deceiue, then plainely to trie out the truthe, they haue also presumed to inuente infinite seede plottes of brawlinge, with the whiche they minister matter of contention to the wranglinge Sophisters, whilest that they drawe out the formes, whilest they call the boyces Generals and Specials, whilest some sticke to the thinges, some to the names, and that whiche they take from one, they ascribe to an other, some take this indifferentlye, and euery one endeuoureth to finde somethinge, wherewith to confirme his Heresie. And in this manner (whiche Thomas Aquinas doth also lament) to laught at and mistruste that inuiolated faithe of oures emonge the wise men of this worlde, whilest that they regarde not the Canonicall Scripture of the holy Ghost, they haue piked out very many apte questions to dispute vpon diuinitee, in the whiche they exercising theire wit, and consuminge theire time haue placed all the doctrine of diuinitee in them alone, against which if any wil resist with the authoritee of the holy Scriptures, fourth with he shall here saie: the letter killeth, it is deadly, it is vnprofitable, but they will saye that we ought to search out that whiche lieth hidden in the letter, afterwarde they hauing recourse to interpreting, to expounding, to glossinge, and to sillogisinge, do rather geue it some other sence, then the proper meaninge of the letter, if thou instantly require an aunsweare, and be earnest vponthem, they will geue euill language and call thee Asse, as one which vnderstandeth not that which is hidden in the letter: but as a Serpente feedest on the earthe alone: so that there is none emongest them accompted for deuines, but suche as can brawle apace, and dispute againste euerye matter proposed, readly to inuent, and find out new vnderstandinges, and to make so greate a noyse with monstruous woordes, that not for the hardnes of the matter, but for the straungnes of woordes they be vnderstoode of no man. And than these be called subtill, angelike, seraphike and deuine doctoures, when they haue handled the matter so, that they cannot be perceiued, then the multitude of the auditours, rushe aboute them, whiche beleue whatsoeuer they haue spoken, is fet from the most hidden misteries of diuinitee: and sweare to folowe the woordes of theire maister, and beleue that it is impossible to knowe that, whiche they knowe not, and are in suche wise entangled in the opinions thereof, that they cannot be conuinced by any cotrary reasons, nor content themselues with any Scripture, but like Anteus doo endeuour to renew theire strength, in the bosome of their mother, whers they were begoten, and demaunde succoure of theire doctoures, Than hastneth faste the rauen to her younge Forsakinge coursinge steede, and cruel hownde And of the carkeise parte to them shee bringes. This therefore is the foode of rauen olde VVherwith when nest she builds, she feedes; her self. Hereof it is come passe, that the highe science of schole diuinitee is not free from erroure and naughtinesse, so many sectes, so many Heresies haue ye wicked hipocrites, & hare brayned Sophisters brought vp: whiche, as Paule saith, preache Christe not for good wil, but for contentio, so that there is sooner founde concorde emonge Philosophers then emonge deuines, which with the opinions of men, and fresh errours haue abolished al the glorie of anciente and professinge with coloured titles a detestable doctcine with diuers manners of expoundinge, as it were deuised Laberinthes, doo againste righte and reason take vpon them the name of holy diuinitee by thefte and robberie, and abusing the names and ordinaunces of holy doctours haue raised vp fectes, as in time past it was sayd in the Churche: I holde with Apollo, meanes they haue ben trayned vp in learninge and swearinge to obserue theire masters traditions do dispise all other, not consideringe what is sayde: but who sayeth it. 229 For this cause no deuine can nowe be truely called learned, but he whiche hathe sworne to that secte, and holding it faste with his teeth doth not stifly defend it, and in euery place maketh a shewe, and hath in his mouthe the name  & signe thereof, and vaunteth to be saluted, and preferred with the title thereof, as  Thomist, Albertist, Scotist, and Occanist For it is not honest that a pure Christian should be called with so many names, for so muche as that furname maye be common with them to Bowchers, Cookes, Bakers, Tailours, Barbers, Watchemen, to fowle sluttes also, and to all the ignoraunt forte. 230 Furthermore these folowers are deuided into many partes emonge themselues, for some of them, whiche haue a profounde wit, and will seeme better learned then the Prophetes, and Apostles, presume also that they are able with theire Syllogismes to finde out, and declare suche thinges as are beleued by faith alone, and with vaine questions thei reason of deuine thinges: and with monstruous boldnes they contende, oftentimes with diuers absurde opinions, as when they distinguish the deuine  Essence from the Relatiues, some in deede, others onely in reason, some facion and make infinite Realtees (as they saye) like the Idees of Plato: others againe denye them, and laughe at them, moreouer then this they inuent so many monsters of God, so many diuers forines of the diuinitee, so many Idoles of their fantasies, and thoughtes of the heauently thinges, and with the crokednesse of theire opinions they rente our Sauioure Christe in peeces, and attire him in diuers maskeries of sophismes, and with theire foolishe suppositions do facion and vnfacio him vnto what forme they liste, as it were an image of ware, so that there doctrins seemeth to be nothinge els but mere idolatrie. 231 I speake not of other theire Heresies, and controuersies aboute the Sacramentes, Purgatorie, Soueraintee, the Popes commaundementes, and theire obligations, indulgences,  Antichriste to come, and many other like in ye whiche they declare theire foolish wisdome, and with the presumptio therof swoolen and puffed vp with pride like the Giauntes whiche are mencioned in fables, heapinge vp questions vpon questions, and argumentes vpon argumentes, pronouncinge theire sentences against God: vpon whose wickednes the wrathe of God will descende from heaue. 232 The others, which reatch not so high, make histories of Saincts, choping in some lie vnder the colour of godlines, they bring false relikes, they forge miracles, and feigne such things as they terme examples, pleasant or fearefull fables, they number prayers, they weigh merites, thei measure ceremonies, thei sel indulgences, they distribute pardons, they sel their good workes,  & deuoure the sinnes of the people thorowe begginge. And as it were with a certaine lawe they tell of appearaunces, of coniurations, and of the aunsweares of deade, and out of the bookes of  Tundall, or of Brandarius, or of Patricius, taught in a denne vnder the earthe they playe tragedies of purgatorie, and comedies of indulgences, in the pulpit as it were (in a stage, & transforming themselues with so warrelike a boldnesse, with so Thrasonicke a bosting, with so arrogaunt lookes, with a chaunged countenance, with streatched armes, with many kindes of gesture: as the Poetes describe Protheus, with vaine woordes and with the vorce of Stentor, But the most ambitious emonge them are they whiche attribute to themselues the ornamente of schole doctrine & Eloquence, these in cryinge (in declaiminge I thought to saie) singe poemes, tell Histories, reason opinions: they cite Homer, Vergill, Iuuenal, Persius, Titus Liuius, Strabo, Varro, Seneca, Cicero, Aristotle, and Plato. And in steede of the Gosple and the woorde of God, they speake mere triftes, and woordes of men, preaching a newe Gospel, counter feitinger the woorde of God: whiche they set foorth not for loue, but for gaine, and monie. Liuinge not after the truth of the woorde, but accordinge to the pleasure of the fleshe, and when in the daie time with diuerse erroures they haue sopken in the pulpitte of vertue the nighte after in priuie places they becme Venus souldiers. And this is their waie, thorowe whiche they goo to Christe. Finally when vices are to be reproued, it is a wounder to see them with what sclaunder of tounge they chafe, with what insolencie of gesture they rage, with what althinesse of speache they barke, with what vnshamesastnes of voice they exclame, as if Christe woulde not haue the trumpetoures of his woorde to be fishers drawinge on the righte side with a gentle nette, but Archers and cruell Hunters persecutinge on the lefte side: And also as they are not men, & subiect to these vices or greater whiche they reproue or at any time haue benne, or yet maie be made subiect, so these fishers of men, whose tounge is in steede of a nette, ye thei maie drawe the wicked to saluation, they are become also hunters of good men to damnation: theire mouth is as it were a bowe of leesinge, and their tongue is a wounding arrowe.  233 But this sufficeth whiche is alreadie spoken, for it is daungerous to reprehende the with too bolde a manner of talke: because they be wonte, as often as they be angred, to cospire togeather, to bring them in iudgement before their Inquisitours, which reproue them, and constraine them to saie the contrarie, sometime to chasten them with fire and fagotte, or priuely with poison to take him out of the worlde: for this they haue emonge the secrete misteries of Religion: if there be any that to theire Religion breadeth sclaunder, which is lawful & honest, geuing him poison in secrete, they bereue him of life, to the end that the order shoulde not be defamed, when publikely he were punished.  234 But leauinge to speake of this let vs nowe passe to the true diuinitee: and this also is deuided in two partes: for the one is Propheticall, the other Interpretatiue. We will firste speake of the of the laste. The Diuines interpretatiue suppose, that as thorow the bountie of nature, Grapes, Oliues, Corne, Hempe, and many suche like growe & are ripened. of whiche finally with the witte and ayde of men, wine, oyle, breade, cloth, and so the other workes of nature are complete and perfourmed. Semblably also the woorde of God very obscure and hidden is geuen to be expounded with our interpretations, not by our forces and inuentions, as if the woorde of God, like ye workes of nature had neede of our healpe, but by ye self same holy spirit of these holy Scriptures: who distributeth his giftes to euery maaccordinge as he listeth, and where he will, making some Prophetes, some interpreters of Prophetes, This Diuinitee than of interpretinge heauenly thinges, dothe not proceede after the manner of the Peripatetickes, by defining, or deuiding or copounding, for none of these waies belongeth vnto God: for somuch as he cannot be defined, deuided, or compounded: but there is an other waie to know him, whiche is in the middle betwene this and the propheticall vision, whiche is an equalitee of the truthe with our purged vnderstanding, as the keye is with the locke, whiche as it is most desirous of all truthes, so is it apte to receaue al intelligible thinges, and therefore it is termed the possible vnderstanding with which although we doo not thorowly vnderstand such things as the Prophets write, and as they whiche haue seene the secretes of God, yet the gate is opened vnto vs, that by the conformitee of the truth perceaued, to our vnderstandinge, and by the lighte, whiche lightneth vs out of the opened entrailes, we are much more certaine then we should be by the apparaunt demonstrations, diffinitions, diuisions, & compositions of Philosophers, and it is graunted vs to reade, and vnderstande not with our eies and outwarde eares, but to perceaue with better senses, and the vaile take awaie and ye face vncouered to receaue in truth from the marowe of the holy Scriptures, which they haue writen vnder coueringes, that with perfect eyes haue beheld it, which was hidden from the wise men of this worlde, and from philosophicall knowledges, and wee set holde on that with so greate a iudgemente of certaintee, that al doubte is laide aside. And for so muche as this truthe lieth manifolde hidden in the holy Scripture, for this cause the holy and spirituall menne haue made diuers and sundrie expositions of the holy Scripture: for some goinge a softe pace vpo the barke of the letter, bringinge the Scriptures to agreement, & expoundinge one woorde for an other, wrestinge some sense by ye order of woordes, by Etymologies, by proprieties & significations of woordes and other like thinges, doo searche out the truthe of the Scripture, whiche therefore they call the literall exposition. Some other referre what thinges soeuer are writen to the busines of the soule, & to the workes of iustice, the exposition of whiche for that cause is called morall. Some by diuers tropes or figures tourne it to secreates of the Church, the sense of which is called Tropologicall. Some geuen to the contemplation of heauenly life, referre all thinges to the mysteries of Goddes glorie, and this exposition they call Anagogicall. And these be the foure expositios of the Deuines exercised in the Church, beside whiche there are yet two other, the one of whiche referringe al thinges to the chaunge of times, alteration of kingdomes, & to the restitutions of times, is for that called Typica, wherein excelled Cyrillus, Methodius, and the Abbot Ioachim, and of them of our time Hyerome Sauanorala of Ferraria. The other searcheth out in the holy Scripture, the powers and vertues of the vniuersall and sensible worlde, of all nature, and of the frame of the world, which exposition hey thereof cal Phisicall or Natural, in this excelled Rabbi Symeon, Ben Ioachim, which wrote vpon Leuiticus a very large volume, wherein wel neare discussinge the natures of all thinges, he sheweth howe Moyses accordinge to the agreement of the triple worlde, and the nature of thinges ordained the Arke, the Tabernacle, the Uessels, the Vestrues, the Rites, the Ceremonies, & the other Mystreries to appease God, & the heauely powers, & hath ordained ma to declare ye likenes of these thinges, & many Cabalistes folowe this opinion, ye is to saie, they which entreate of bresith, that is to saie, of thinges created. For they whiche reasoninge of Mercana, that is, of the iudgement seate of God, nby figures, by reuolutions, by Symbolike reasons doo referre all thinges to the principall him selfe, these searche out the Anagogicall sense. These then are the fire moste famous senses of the holy Scripture, the Authours of which, the Expositours, and all the Interpretours, with a common name be called Diuines. Of this sorte emongst vs were Dyonisius, Origines, Policarpus, Eusebius, Tertullian, Iren aeus, Nazianzenus, Chrysostome, Athanasius, Basile, Damascen, Lactantius, Cyprian, Hierome, Augustine, Ambrose, Gregorie, Ruffine, Leo, Cassiane, Barnard, Anselme, and many other holy Fathers, which were in time paste, and also some other of latter yeares, as Thomas, Albert, Bonauentura, Egidius, Henry of Gaunte, Gerson, & many other: 235 but farre inferiour to the auncientes. 236 Notwithstanding all the interpretinge Deuines, for somuch as they are men, they also suffer humaine things, in one place they erre, in an other they write contraries and repugnances, oftentimes they disagree from themselues, in many thinges, they goo besides the marke, and euery man seeth not al thinges. For the holy Ghost alone hath the full knowledge of heauenly thinges, which distributeth to euery man after a certaine measure, reseruinge many thinges to him selfe, that alwaies he maie haue vs his schollers. For we all (as Paule saithe) knowe not nor Prophecie but in parte. All this interpretinge Diuinitee then consisteth in the libertie of the spirite, and is a certaine wisdome seperate from the Scripture, in the which it is graunted euery man to abounde accordinge to his sense, by those manifolde expositions, which we haue recited, whiche Paule in one woorde termeth misteries, or speaches of misteries, where he saithe: The spirite speaketh misteries. Wherefore Dyonisius calleth this Misticall and Significatiue Deuinitee, entreated of by these holy doctours in great volumes, 237 but sometime not without many errours.  238 Neither doo you beleue them in all thinges, for many of them haue perseuered in many erroneous opinions touching Faithe, which haue bene reproued by the Churche for Hereticall. As it is Manifeste of  Papia Bishop of Hieropolis, of Victorinus of Poitiers, of Hierenceus of Lions, whom it is manifestly knowne that they erred in faithe, and their opinions condemned for Hereticall, although they be canonised for Sainctes. Here notwithstandinge it is needefull to haue a higher spirite to iudge and decerne, whiche is not geuen vs by men, nor by flesh and bloude, but is geuen from aboue by the father of light, for none without his light can truely sepake any godly thinge. And this light is God woorde, by ye which al things are made, geuing light to euery mathat cometh into this worlde,  & geuing them power to be made the sonnes of God: to all them I speake that haue receaued and beleued in him. Neither is there any that can declare those thinges whiche belonge to God, but his owne woorde, for who els hath knowen the Lordes meaning? or who els is made his counsailoure, but the sonne of God, the woorde of the Father? Hereof we wil speake, but first we will entreate of Propheticall Diuinitee. Euen as prophecie is the speache of the Prophetes, so Diuinitee is nothing els but the traditio of Diuines, that is to saie, of them that speake with God: for euery one that shall remember any propheeie, or els interprete it, he is not foorthwith a Prophete, but he, that in heauenly thinges with the knowledge of godlinesse is endewed with vertue, and holines, which speaketh with God, and on his lawe doth thinke daie, and nighte: for in this wise Iohn the authoure of the Apocalips, in the letters of Dionysius was named Theologus, that is, a deuine, that is to saie, of his talking with God: to whome the truthe saithe: he that heereth you, heereth me: & be that despiseth you, despiseth me: which woorde was not spoken to our Masters, not to the cotentious Theosophistes, not to the sellers of indulgences, but to the true Deuines, to the Apostles, to the Euangelistes, and to the messengers of Gods woorde, which saie: I dare not speake any thing, which Christe dothe not through me. The holy doctrines then of these diuines, of faithe, and pietee, are Diuinitee. To theire woordes and writinges credite is geuen, as to thinges grounded not vpon the contentions of syllogismes or opinions of menne, but vpon sounde doctrine (as Paule saith) inspired from aboue: not after the manner of the Philosophers goten by diuidinge, defininge, copoundinge, nor contemplatinge, but with a certaine essential touching of diuinitee, comprehended by a cleare vision in the heauenly lighte: of which vision we finde very many kindes in the holy Scripture, accordinge to the diuers dispositions of the Prophetes in receauinge, for we reade of some that saw God or the Angels in the forme of a man, others in the likenesse of fire, others in the likenes of the aire and the winde, others in the likenesse of a riuer and of water, others in the likenesse of birdes, others in the likenesse of pretious stoones & mettals, others in the likenesse of letters and carracters, or of a hande that writeth, others in the sounde of a voice, others in dreames, others in a certaine spirite abidinge within them, others in the efficacie of vnderstanding, wherefore the holy Scripture termeth al the Prophetes, seinge. So we reade: the sight or vision of Isaie, the vision of Icremie, the vision of Ezechiell, and of others. And in the newe lawe Iohn saith: I was in spirite at that daie of the Lorde, in the whiche I beinge carried sawe the throne of God. And Paule witnesseth that he sawe such thinges as are not lawfull for a man to speake: and this sighte or beholdinge of many is called a rauishinge, or a traunce, or a spirituall death: for then there is a certaine seperation of the soule from the bodie, but not of the bodie from the soule. Of this death it is saide: man shall not see God and shall liue: And in another place: In the Lordes sighte the death of his sainctes is pretions. And yet it is more plainely expressed by the Apostle, where he saith ye be deade, & your life is hidden with Christe, he then must die this death that desireth to enter into the holy places of propheticall Diuinitee. And the beholdinge of this heauenly vision is of two sortes: the one, with the which God is seene face to face, and then the Prophetes see (as Paule saithe) such thinges as are not lawfull for a man to speake, & such thinges as the tongue of men and Angles is not able to expresse, nor penne to write. For it is a certaine touchinge and vnion of the diuine substaunce, and a beautifiynge of the pure and seperated vnderstandinge without any image or semblance, and therefore the diuines interprete this a Meridional doo largely discourse of these thinges: An other vision there is wherein the hinder partes of God be seene: that is to saie, when with cleare sighte the creatures be perceaued, whiche be the hinder partes & effectes of God, by the knowledge of whiche the creatoure shaper of all thinges, and the firste cause which maketh all thinges is knowen, as the wiseman saithe: by the greatnes of the image and the creature, the Creatour of them maie be knowen. And Paule of the same saith: the inuisible thinges of God are vnderstoode made by them whiche haue bene made: moreouer the Peripatetickes haue in vse a certaine manner of speakinge, that they whiche argue from the effectes to the causes, are saide to reason a posteriori, that is, of the latter. Moses had bothe these visions, the holy Scriptures witnessing the same, for of the first we reade that Moses sawe the Lorde face to face: of the other wee reade that God saide, vnto him: Thou shalte see my hinder partes, and accordinge to this seconde vision Moses made the Lawe, and appointed sacrifices & ceremonies, and erected and Arke, and in them he comprehended other mysteries, & al the secretes of the workes of God and nature, after the moste diligent example of the whole vniuersall: and this vision also is deuided in twoo partes: for either it beholdeth the creatures in God himselfe, and is called of the diuines the mornyng vision, or seeth God in his creatures, and is called the nighte vision: There is moreouer an other certaine propheticall vision, that is to saie, that whiche chaunceth in dreames, as we reade in Mathewe, that the Angel appeared to Ioseph in his sleepe: & in an other place, that the wise men were admonisshed in theire sleepe when they had woorshipped Christe that they should retourne into theire countrie an other waie. There are also in the old Testament many exaples therof: & finally Iob declareth what manner of vision this is, where he saith: In the feare of ye night vision, when slope falleth vpon men, & that they be in bed, then openeth he their eares, and teaching, instructeth them with doctrine. And this as the fourth kind of visions is called the night vision. There are yet twoo other kindes of prophecie, one, whiche is receiued with expresse woordes, in which kinde Moses in the mounte Syna, Abraham, Iacob, Samuel, and many other Prophets of the old Testament, were made famous and instructed: in the new law the Apostles, and al the Disciples of Christe, were taughte with a true and liuely vice by christe. An other kinde of Prophecie hapneth thorowe the mouing of the spirit, that is, when the soule is attached by some diuine power, to him then linked, & seuered from the liuinge man, and is replenished by him with wisdome and knowledge, beyonde all mans wit and strength, whiche attachement of the soule or inspiration, proceedeth not onely from an angelike power, but oftentimes also from the spirite of the Lorde, as it is read of Saul, that the spirit of the Lorde entred into him, and prophecied, and was chaunged into an other man, & reckoned emonge the Prophetes. And in the Actes of the Apostles the holy Ghoste entred into the baptized in a flame of fire, and this spirite oftentimes also rauished me subiecte to sinne, and many Poetes of the gentiles, as Cassandra, Helenus, Calchas, Amphiarus, Tiresia, Mopsus, Amphilochus, Polybius of Corinth, In like maner Galanus the Indian, Socrates, Diotima, Anaximander, Epimenides of Crete. Semblably, the wise men of the Perseans, the Brachanni of Asia, ye Gymnosophistes of the Ethiopians, the Prophets of Memphis, ye Druides of the Frechmen, and the Sybilles were replenished with this spirite. Before whiche propheticall attachement of the sprit there oftentimes go certaine ceremonies, and also to execute ye authoritee of ones duty, & the communion of holy thinges do helpe very much: as the Scripture doth geue example of Balam, & in an other place of the application of Ephod: and the Cuangeliste witnesseth of Caiphas, that he prophecied Hebrewes haue presumed to write of the skilfulnesse howe to prophecie. I passe ouer those thinges whiche the diuines with deepe contemplation of the vnderstandinge do intreate of the xxxij. pathes, and those whiche Augustine sheweth seuen kindes in sleepe, and so many appearauces in watche. Of whiche this one thing we will admonish you to be cosidered: that not alwayes to diuine powers come outwardlye to be seene of the Prophetes, or to speake with them, but very oftentimes those thinges are caused inwardly, that is to say, when the minde of the Prophete doth receiue the diuine light: the shining whereof dispersed with his beames thorowe the middest of all thinges, euen vnto this grosse body, doth make the very senses partakers of his felicitee, and passinge inwardly from the vnderstanding thorowe the reason and imagination, & vniuersally thorowe the whole soule, euen vnto the instrumentes of the senses doth in them lye couered, as the night or light, or vision, or talke that moueth euery sense with his own condicio: and that truly hath chaunced to many prophets, to some in theire watche, to some in theire sleepe. So wee reade in Plato and Proculus of Socrates, whiche saye that he was not onely inspired by intelligible influence, but also by voyce and communication: Notwithstandinge these thinges chaunce sooner in dreames: but of this we haue sufficiently spoke. It is more then time that we retourne to our pourpose. Propheticall diuinitee therefore is that which by the inspiration of the sight teacheth the steadfast woorde of God: but the authoritee and argumentes with which his truth isestablished, are not the decrees of men, not the vse of longe time not the faigned deuises of wisemen, not the princely ordinaunces of sectes, not Syllogismes, not Euthymemes, oracles agreeinge togeather receiued in the vniuersal Church by one whole and stable consente, confirmed with miracles, monsters, wonders, and with all kinde of holinesse and daunger of life, and with the test monie of the bloude shedde for vs. We haue Moises, Iob, Dauid, Salomon, and many other Canonical writers & Prophetes of the olde Testamente, Doctours of this propheticall diuinitee. The Doctours of the newe Testament be the Apostles, and Euangelistes, & although al these were replenished with ye holy Ghoste, notwithstandinge all did in some place swarue from the truth, and in that they were liers, they made no lye wittingly nor craftly, for the saye, this, is a moste damnable tingly nor crastly, for to saye, this, is a moste damnable Heresie, and greater, and more daungerous then the Heresies of Arrius and Sabellicus, turninge vpset downe the authoritee of al the Canonicall Scripture: notwithstandinge in this so greate an erroue in time paste was that greate, and holy Ierome, a lye shoulde haue bene admitted in the holy Scripture, incontinently (as Augustine saith) al the certainetee of ye holy Scriptures shoulde faile. Unto whome Ierome acknowledginge the erroure and perceiuinge the truthe, after many contradictions, and defenses of his erroure yeelded in the ende, that then whiche I saie, that ye holy writers haue in some place after a certaine sorte ben lyers, I wil ye it be vnderstoode, not ye they haue willingly erred, but ye either like men they haue ben deceiued, or chaunging ye will of God haue reuolted. So Moses failed, who promised the people of Israel to bringe them out of Egypte, & to leade the into ye lande of promisse,  & truely he brought the out of Egypt, but to the lande of promisse he brought them not. Ionas failed fortelling ye Niniuites there destructio within the space of xl. daies, which notwithstanding was deferred, Helias failed foreshwing the miseries that should happe in ye daies of Achab, which also were prolonged vntil the death of Achab. Isay should die the day folowing, whose death was prolonged fiftene yeres after. Likewise many other prophetes haue failed, and al theire prophecies are some taken awaye, or suspended. The Apostles also and the Euangelistes haue failed, Peter failed when he was reproued by Paule. Mathewe erred whe he wrote that Christ was not yet dead, when the speare opened his side. But this defecte or faylinge is not the defecte of the holy Ghost, but either of the Prophete, not well perceiuinge what the spirite telleth him, or ye vision sheweth him, or by some alteration made in those thinges of which he prophecied, whereof it commeth to passe, that the sentence of the oracle is either altered or deferred. Hereof it commeth to passe, that all the Prophetes and writers in some thinges appeare lyers, accordinge to the Scripture that saithe: euery man is a liar. But Christe alone God and man was neuer founde, nor shalbe founde a liar, neither shal his woordes be chauged, or faile, who onely is without lie and errour, he hath neuer vttered vaine oracles, as he hath said: Heauen and earth shal perish but my woordes shal not perishe: and because all truthe commeth thorowe the holy Ghost, Christ alone doth assuredly possesse this holy spirite, and shal not departe from him, but rest in him. It is not so of others: for the spirite came vpon Moises, but in the striking of the rocke he was taken away. He came vpon Aron, but in the sinne of the calfe he departed. He came vpon Anne theire sister, but in the murmuringe against Moises, he left her. He came vpon Saul, Dauid, Salomon, Isay, & others, but he continued not in them. Neither be the Prophets alwaies Prophets: nor alwaies see, nor alwaies foretel, nor a cotinual habit is prophecie, but a gift, a passion,  & a spirit that passeth, & seing there is none, which doth not offede, there is none from whom the spirite doth not depart, or at the leste wise forsaketh him for a time, sauing from the onely sonne of God Iesus Christe, of whome therefore it was sayde in Iohn. Upon whome thou shalte see the sprite descende, and abide in him, this is the Sonne of God, which Baptiseth in the holy Ghost, and can likewise communicate him to others. Wherefore (as Simonides saithe). God alone hath this honour, that he is supernatural, and so we may truly say: Christe alone hath this honour, that he is a diuine, notwithstandinge let no man thinke that the Scriptures of the olde Testament, after that the Gospel by them was brought to light with the diuine birthe of Christe, are for this cause feeble and deade, for they alwayes liue in great authoritee, by them the Apostles proued theire doctrines, and without theire testimonie haue spoken nothing: Christ sendeth vs to search them, whose Gospel doth not vndoe these Scriptures, but hath fulfilled them euen to the leaste iote and point. But hereof we will more largely discourse beneth. This moreouer is also to be considered, that the holy Scripture it selfe doth want in many volumes, whiche easely by it selfe is perceiued. For Moises citeth the bookes of the warres of the Lorde: & Iosua, the booke of the iuste: Hester, the booke of the thinges worthie of memorie, the booke of the Machabees alleageth the holy bookes of the Spartiates, & Paralippomenon maketh mention of the bookes of the lamentations, the bookes of the vision of Samuel, the bookes of Nathan, of Gad, of Semeia, of Haddo, of Ahia Silonites, and of Iesus ye Sonne of Hammon Prophets. Iudas alleageth in his Canonicall Epistle the booke of Henoch. The booke of Abraham the Patriarcke is cited of menne worthie of credite, all which haue perished and are founde nowhere. And moreouer all they whiche be reade at this daye are not indifferently approued. For Dionysius alleageth the Gospel of Bartholomewe, and Ierome preface of the Gospel saith that many haue taken in hande to write the Gospel, al whose bookes are loste, and are not to be found againe, and many of them, because they haue ben corrupted by Heretickes, or els published without the title of a certaine authoure, haue not ben receiued by the fathers, nor approued by ye Church. In the meane season I speake nothinge of the false Prophetes, whiche haue crepte in, prophecyinge for vaine glories sake those thinges which the holy Ghoste hath not taught them, but certaine layes, not herde of whiche are not after the truthe of the Scripture, they bring in sectes not for the vnitee of the spirit, nor for the peace of the Churche, and making themselues as it were the counseilours of God thorowe a rashe presumption, dreade not to take the Lordes Testamente in theire mouthe, and to write prophecies, and Gospels, all which are either hereticall or not vsed opely in ye Church, nor put into the holy Canon, as it is manifeste of the Canons of the Apostles. But the songes of Salomon were not put into the holy Canon of the Hebrewes, before thei were corrected and approued by the Prophete Isaye. And thus by these thinges it is easily perceiued, that the true diuinitee, that is to wit, the holy Scripture is founde depriued of many volumes, and after a sort vnperfecte, and very fewe of many remaine true and certaine, whiche as bookes of life do make vp the holy Canon. Beholde ye haue nowe harde howe doubtefull, howe double, how vncertaine, howe ful of daunger al doctrines are, that asmuche as is in them wee are constrayned to be ignoraunt, where the truth resteth, yea in diuinitee, excepte there be one whiche hathe the keye of knowledge of discretion (for the armarie of the truthe is locked, and hidden vnder diuers misteries, and shut vp also from the wise & holy men) by the which we might enter into such a great, and incomprehensible treasure. And this onely keye is nothing els, then the Woorde of God, this alone decerneth euerye signification and kinde of woordes, & what communication proceedeth from ye Arte of Sophistrie, which doth not shewe the truthe, but a certaine image therof: and iudgeth what talke posiesseth the truthe not in apparaunce and counterfeit coloure, but in effecte and reason, therein euery arte of deceipt and lyes is surmounted, neither argumentes, nor sillogismes, nor any subtilties, of Sophismes can stande againste it. He ye deliteth not his minde therwith, or disagreeth from it, he as Paule saith is prowde and knoweth nothing: Wherefore it behoueth vs to trie by the Woorde of God all the disciplines, and opinions of sciences, as golde is tried by the touche stone, and in all thinges to floe thither as to a moste stiffe rocke, & out of that alone to seeke for the truth of all things, and to iudge of all doctriue, of the opinions and expositions of al men, 239 and that we reade not by the doctrines, by the gloses, by the expositios, or by other sayinges of men, although they be most holy and beste learned, the I meane which speake either without or against the authoritee of Gods Woorde, 240 For as Gregorie saith, what soeuer hath not authoritee from thence, is as easily confuted as proued, but no schole of Philosophers, nor the scholes of any schollers haue taught vs the knowledge of this woorde, but God alone and Iesus Christ thorow the holy Ghost in these Scriptures whiche are called Canon, to the whiche accordinge to Gods commaundemente nothing may be added nor taken away. For whosoeuer shal do it although he were an Angel of heauen, he is abandoned to the Deuill, and accused by the Lawe of God. So great is ye maiestie, so great is ye power of this Scripture, that it aloweth no straunge expositions, no gloses of men nor Angles: neither suffereth it selfe to be bowed to the opinions of mens wittes as if it ware of were, nor after the manier of mens fables suffereth it self to be transformed or chauged into diuers senses as it were some Poetical Proteus, but sufficiente of it selfe, doth expounde and interprete it selfe, and iudging al men of name is iudged. For the authoritee therof is greater (as Augustine saith) then all the insight of mans wit: for it that one constant, plaine and holy meaninge, in which alone the truth doth consiste, & in which it fighteth & vanquisheth. But other Moral, Mystical, Comsomological, Typical, Anagogical, Tropological, & Allegorical meaninges which are without this, with whiche many doo depainte it with sundrie & straunge coloures, can rightly and truly teache vs some things, and perswade also to the edification of the people, but they cannot proue any thinge or repugne or reproue to establishe the authoritee of the Woorde of God. For let one bringe in controuersie of these senses, let him also cite what substancial authour soeuer he liste therupo, let him alleage an interpretoure, let him cite a glosse, let him alledge the exposition of all the holy Fathers, all these thinges doth not so binde vs, but that we maye saye the contraie. But of the letter of ye Scripture: of the draught and order thereof, bondes are made, whiche noman can breake, noman can escape: but that dashinge and dissoluinge all the force of argumentes, dothe enforce him to say and cofesse, that it is the singer of God, that man neuer spake in this manner, ye he speaketh not as ye Scribes and Phariseis do, but as one that hathe power. But the authoures thereof inspired from aboue haue with moste holesome authoritee made vs a Canon, the magnificence whereof is suche, that wee oughte to beleeue all thinges that are therin, and whatsoeuer he hath pronounced and taught, this without any retraction is holden sure and holy. As Augustine hathe sayde hereof, that he gaue this onely honoure to those bookes, whiche be called Canonicall, that he moste constantly beleeueth that none of the writers of them haue erred. But that to the other he will not geue credit, how much doctrine & holines so euer they haue in the, except it be proued with euident reason out of Gods woorde, that it is not vnlike to be ture. Unto these Christe sendeth vs teaching ye we should search the Scriptures. The Apostle comaundeth vs to proue al things by them, and to keepe the good, and so proue the spirites also, whether they be of God, and in them to be able to render an accompte of all thinges, & to reproue the gainesaiers, that in this wise beinge made spirituall we maie iudge all thinges and be iudged of none. But the truth and vnderstandinge of these Scriptures (I meane Canonciall) dependeth vpon the onely authoritee of God reuelinge the same, whiche cannot be comprehended by any iudgement of the senses, by any compassing reason, by any sillogisme of demonstration, by any science, by any speculation, by any contemplation, and finally with any force of man, sauinge by the onely faithe of Iesus Christe poured into our soule from God the father by the holy ghost. Which truely is so much the more higher and stable then al the credulitee of mens knowledges, by how much God him selfe is higher and truer then men: but why saie I truer: Naie rather God alone is true, and euery man a liar: then all that whiche cometh not from this truthe, is errour, as that, whiche is not of faithe, is sinne. For God alone hath in him selfe, the fountaine of truth, fro which it is necessarie that he drawe, which desireth the true doctrine: seeinge that any science is not, nor can be had of the secretes of nature, of the seuered substaunces, nor of God the authoure of them, excepte it be reuealed from aboue. For heauenly thinges are not touched with the strength of men, and naturall thinges at euery instaunt slee from the inwarde thought, whereof it cometh to passe, that the same which we beleue to be ye knowledge of these things, is falset and errour, which Isaie doth reproue in the Philosophers and wise men of the Caldees, sayinge to them: Thy wisdome and thy knowledge is that which hath deceaued thee, thou haste failed in the multitude of thy inuentions. The Grammarian is very heedefull that he offende not in his talke, and that he vtter not a rude & barbarous woorde, but in the meane space he doth no drale regarde the dishonestie, and the sinnes of this life, semblablely the Poete had lieffer to halte in his life then in his Uerse:the Historiographer leaueth in memorie, and putteth in writinge the deedes of Kinges and peoples, and the order of times: but hath no regarde of his owne life: and if he haue, he will not, or he is ashamed to confesse it. The Oratoure abhoreth more the rudenes of speache, then the deformitee of life. The Logitioner had rather to denie a manifest truthe, then to yeelde to his aduersarie in one Syllogisticall coclusion. The Arithmetriticons, and the Geometricians number and measure al thinges, but they make no accompte of the numbers and measures of soule and life. The Musitians also entreate of soundes & songes, dispisinge the manners and discordaunces of the minde: as Diogenes Synopeus was wonte to reproue them, sayinge, that fitly they made the stringes agree to the Harmonie: but they had the manners of ye minde discordaunt and without order. The Astrologers doo behold the heauens and the sterres, & doo prognosticate to others what shall happen in the world: but they doo not consider that which dayly hangeth ouer their heades. The Cosmographers geue notice of Countries, of the fourmes of Mountaines, of the courses of Riuers, of the limites of Regions: but they make a man neuer the better, nor the wiser. The Philosophers with greate auauntinge doo searche out the causes and the beginninges of thinges, but God the Creatour of all thinges they neglect & know not. Emong Princes and Magistrates there is no peace, and one for a lighte gaine seeketh an others destruction. The Phisitions cure the bodies of the sicke, and neglecte their owne soules. The Lawiers very diligente in the lawes of men, doo transgresse Gods commaundementes: 241 nor the Lawier dieth well, because Phisitions be the most disordered sorte of men, & the Lawiers be the naughtiest men that liue, and that we dayly see, and one Baldus an expositour of the Lawe a man of great same emongst them doth witnesse, that oftentimes they die sodainly. The Diuines cryinge out preache vnto vs the commaundementes of God and holy doctrine, but in their liuinge they differ very farre: and had lieffer seeme to knowe then loue God: 242 and verely were it true that many of them also vnder the profession of Diuinitee did not defende the doctrine of ye Deuil, suppressing and condemninge the veritee of Gods woorde. 243 He then whiche knoweth al other thinges, to speake and write well, perceaueth the nature of a Uerse, the course of times, the waies of reasoninge, the ornamentes of speache, the coloures of Rhetoricke, and remembreth many things, the proportions and summes of numbers, the harmonie of al tunes, and measures of dauncinge, the measures of all quantitees, the inflexion & resterion of the sunne beames, the situation of the earth and sea, the greatnes of al buildinges, diuerse workinges of ingines, the bickeringe in warres, the trimminge of the grounde, the takinge, feeding and fattinge of beastes, birdes and fishe, and euery kinde of countrie trade, euery industrie of handicraftes, and artificers, paintinge, or engrauing, foundinge, hammeringe and hewinge, factoringe and sayling, the course of the starres, & the influences vpon these inferiour bodies, the wittie foresewinges of destinies, and what soeuer diuinations there be of thinges hidden and to come, the vnpreignable & more then Magicall monsters of the Artes Magicke, the secretes of the Cabalistes, & the causes of al naturall thinges which are aboue the highest seates and natures, the reformation of maners, the diuerse gouermentes of a common weale, housholde instruction, the remedies for diseases, the vertues of medecines, the knowledge and the mixtures of them, the delicate dressinges of meates, to alter the kindes of thinges, and out of them al to drawe the life of the worlde. Let him know also bothe lawes, the tragicall pleadinges, of aduocates, 244 and the holy doctrine of holy Fathers, of diuine matters, he I saie, which knoweth all these things, and more, if there be any remaininge, yet he knoweth 246 nothinge, excepte he know the will of Gods woorde, and execute the same: he that hath learned all thinges, & hath not learned this, he hath learned in vaine, and knoweth all thinges in vaine. In the woorde of God is the waie, therin is the rule, therein is the butte or pricke, whether he ought to goo that will not go astraie, and touche the truth, all other knowledges are subiecte to time and forgetfulnes, and not onely these sciences and Artes, but also these letters carracters, and tongues, whiche we vse, shall perishe, and other shall arise, and peraduenture they haue more then once bene extinguished, and oftentimes haue come to lighte againe. Neither hath there bene alwaies one manner of Orthographie, nor like with all men, or in one age, and the true pronuntiation of the Latine tongue at this daie is founde no where, and the auncient carracters of the Hebrewes are loste, and there is no remembrance of them, but they which be vsed now 247 the whiche well neare hath hapned to all tongues, that there is none at this daie which knowledgeth or vnderstaundeth his antiquitee, newe woordes alwaies springinge vp, and the olde decayinge, and these againe restoared to theire former vsage: so that there is nothing stable and of continuance. Finally the sentence of Terence is, that nothinge is nowe spoken which hath not bene spoken before, and so perhaps nothing is done, whiche hath not bene done before, yea furthermore al for the moste parte (emonge whiche Volaterrane is) woulde that the gun, which of the most parte of men is thought a newe inuention of the Germans, was vsed in olde time: and this they proue with the Uerses of Virgil: I did eke Salmon see enduringe dire tormenting rappes VVhilst counterfaited he the flames of Ioue and crashinge clappes Of hauen highe, on twise two goodly steedes he carried rode, And slashing aie the sirie leames, did make nowhere abode. But went through Greece triumphauntly, and throughout Elis streates, And cald him selfe a God: O witlesse wighte whiche flaminge heates Of airie sire, and thunder did set fourth in semblaunt shewe, VVith brasse & course of fower footed steedes;--- Hath not Ecclesiasticus spoken hereof, when he saithe: what is that which hath bene, that which hath ben made; what is that whiche hath bene made; that which is to be made. There is no newe thing vnder the sunne, nor any man can saie: Beholde this is newe, for it hath bene alreadie in times paste before vs. There is no remebrace of things past, neither thei which shalbe in ye latter daie, shal remember the thinges which shalbe hereafter. And a little after he saithe: The learned: & the ignoraunt also shall die: what then shall we here saie? but that all Sciences & Artes are subiecte to death & forgetfulnesse, neither for euer shall they remaine aliue, but togeather with death they shal passe to death, forsomuch as Christe saith: That euery plante whiche the heauenly father hath not planted, shalbe rooted out, and caste into euerlasting fire, it is farre from that science auaileth to immortalitee, but the woorde of God alone abideth for euer. The knowledge whereof is so needeful to vs, that he that despiseth it, that estemeth it not, and that heareth it not (as the woordeit selfe witnesseth in the holy Scriptures) God will sende vpon him cursinge, damnation, and euerlastinge iudgemente. Ye ought not then to thinke, that it belongeth onely to diuines, but to euery one, man & woman, olde and younge, and all men accordinge to the grace of capacitee geuen to them, are bounde to haue the knowledge thereof, and not to differ a strawes breadth from it. For this cause it is commaunded in the old Testament: thse woordes shalbe in thy harte all the daies of thy life, and thou shalt tell and commaunde thy children & Nephewes to kepe and put them in vre, thou shalte muse vpon them sittinge in thy house, and goinge thorow the streate, slepinge and wakinge, and shalte binde them for a token in thy hande, thei shalbe, and shal moue before thy eies, and shalte write them in the haunce of the doore, and vpon the doores of thy house. So Iosua reade all the woordes, and those thinges whiche were writen in the volume of the lawe before all the multitude of men, women, children, and straungers. And Esdras brought the booke of the law before all the multitude of men and women, and therein reade openly in the streate to al them that coulde vnderstande: and Christ comaundeth his Gospel to be preached to euery creature thorow out the whole worlde, and that not in darknesse, not in the eares, not in secrete, not in chambers, not to any Masters and Scribes drawe aside: but openly, in the lighte, vpon houses, to the people, to the multitude: for so saith he to the Apostles: That which I speake to you, I speake to all men, that which I speake to you in darknes, speake you in lighte, and that which I tel you in your eares, preache vpon the houses, and Peter in the Actes saithe: He hath charged vs to preache to the people, And Paule commaundeth that children should be brought vp in Christes commaundementes, & that more is Christe blamed his disciples forbidding little children to come vnto him, whose simplicitee & humilitee, as they which haue not their minde preueted with any naughtie opinions, nor swollen vp with any knowledges of men, teacheth it to be so necessarie, to the hirer of Gods woorde, that except one become as a childe, he is altogeather vnmeete for the kingdome of God. For this cause Chrysostome in a certaine Homelie willeth, that childern aboue al thinges should be occupied in the holy Scriptures, yea furthermore that at home and priuately the husbandes should dispute with their wiues & children emong themselues of the holy Scripture, and that the one and the other should searche, and geue sentence. And the counsaile of Nice ordained in his Decrees, that no Christian should be without the holy bookes of the Bible. Understande ye then that there is nothinge in the holy Scriptures so harde, so profounde, so difficulte, so hidden, so holy which appertaineth not to all them that beleue in Christe: 248 nor that hath in suche sorte bene committed to these our Masters, that they ought & maie hide it from the Christian people 249 but rather all diuinitee ought to be common to all beleuers, and to euery one according to the capacitee, and measure of the gifte of the holy ghoste. Wherefore it is the dutie of a good doctour to distribute to euery man, sinuch as he is able to receiue, to one in milke, to an other in stronge meate, and to beguile no man of the foode of necessarie truthe. Finally that at length I maie come to my self againe, ye haue hearde of those thinges, whiche haue bene hitherto spoken from the beginninge, that Sciences & Artes are nothing els, then traditions of men, approued by vs for the good beleefe towardes them, & that all these do consiste of no other thing but of doubteful things and opinions, by apparaunt demonstrations: and that all are not so vncertaine as deceiptfull, as also wicked: Wherefore it is altogeather wicked to beleue, that they can bring vnto vs any blessednes of diuinitie, in the time past this was the superstition of the Gentiles, which with diuine honoures woorshipped the inuentours of thinges, & them whiche they sawe to surpasse others in any Science or Arte, and placed them in the number of their Gods, dedicatinge to them Churches, Aulters, and Images, and Egyptians, whereas he was firsie a Philosopher, and referring the beginnings of nature to the fire, he afterwarde was woorshipped for the God of sire: and Esculapins (as Celsus saithe) because he some what more subtley practised Phisicke which was yet rude, was for ye cause canenised. And this is that edificatio, and no other, of sciences: whiche that auncient Serpente the shaper of such Gods, promised to our first parents, saying to them: ye shalbe as Gods, knowinge the Good and the euill. In this Serpente lette him then auaunte, that glorieth in knowledge. For none can possesse knowledge without the fauoure of the serpente, whose doctrines are nothing but elusions, and the ende is alwaies naught, as it is also 250 so growen to a Prouerbe emong the people: all wisemen are madde, whereunto Aristotle accordeth, sayinge: that there is no greate knowledge without mixture of madnes, and Augustine witnesseth, that many for the desire of knowledge haue loste their witte, neither is there any thinge more contrary to Christian faithe and religion, then knowledge: and do lesse agree togeather. For we know by the Ecclesiasticall histories, yea taught by experience, how sciences wente to wracke when the faithe of Christe wared stronge, so that the greatest & better parte of them vtterly perished, for those most mightie Artes of Magicke departed in suche wise, that not the signes of them remaine, & of so many sectes of Philosophers, scarsly one Peripateticke hath remained, & the same not perfecte. Neither did the Churche stande in better state, & in more assured quietnesse, then when all these Sciences were brought into a straight, when Grammar was not but vnder Alexander Gallus alone, Logicke in the handes of Petrus Hispanus, Laurentius Aquilegius sufficed for Rhetoricke, a hret tarie of times was suffficient for Historier, the Ecclesiasticall computation, for the Mathematical disciplines, & for all the reste Isidorus alone was sufficient. But nowe after that the skilfulues of the tongues, eloquence, and the number of authoures come to theire olde state againe, and sciences growe in vse, the quietnes of the Churche is troubled, and newe Heresies arise. Neither is there any kinde of menne lesse meete to receaue Christian doctrine, then they whiche haue theire minde seasoned with the opinions of Sciences. For they are so stiffe and obstinate in theire opinions, that they leaue no place for the holy Ghost, and doo so assure themselues, and truste in theire owne strength and proper witte, that they yeelde to, nor allowe no truthe: but that whiche they can shew with sillogistical reasons: and they skorne and dispise those thinges, whiche they cannot searche out or vnderstande by theire owne stregth & industrie. And therefore Christe hath hidden this from the wise and the prudent, & reueleth it to little children, that is to say, they which are poore in spirit possessing no treasures of scieces, which are pure in hart, defiled with no opinions of sciences, whih are peace makers, not folowers of other men, to the intent to learne, not cotentious, nor ouerthrowing the truth with wrangling sillogismes, & which suffer not persecution for truthe and iustice: 251 whiche are holden for Asses, and beastes of those cotentions Sophisters, which are drawen thorow the scholes, listed out of the pulpits, driuen out of theire studies, sometimes accused for Heretickes, and oftentimes threatned daunger of life, and with cruell tormentes sometimes put to death. 252 So in time paste was  Socrates poysoned in Athens. Anaxagoras  253 deathe almoste present with spedy flight. Emonge the Prophets of the Hebrewes, also, Isaye was cut in peeces, Hieremie stoned to death. Daniel downe headlonge from a steepe place, Zacharie slaine at the Aultar, Helias persecuted by lezabell, whiche also slewe many Prophetes: And that holy Patriarke Abraham was caste also into a fornace by ye Caldees: So the Apostles and disciples of Christe, and infinit martires witnesses of Christe his Diuinitee were kilde also with diuers tormentes. And all these were put to death for no other cause, but that they thought more holily, then those wise menne of the worlde. Beholde those whiche in suche wise in pouertie of spirite, in puritie of hart and in the peace of conscience are younge babes and humble, ready also to shedde theire bloude for the truthe, these I saye be they ro whome alone that true and blessed wisedome is geuen, whiche bringeth vs into the fellowshippe of the blessed Goddes, and maketh vs like to them. As christe plainely teacheth vs this, saieing: Blessed are the poore in spirit, for theirs is the kingedome of heauen: blessed are the cleane in hart, for thei shal see God: blessed are the peace makers, for they shalbe called the childerne of God: blessed be they which suffer persecution for righteousnes sake, for theirs is the kingedome of heauen: It is better therfore and more profitable to be Idiotes, and knowe nothinge to beleue by Faithe and charitee, and to become next vnto God, the being losty & prowde through the subtilties of sciences to fall into the possession of the Serpente. So we reade in the Gospel, howe Christe was receiued of idiotes, of the rude people, and of the simple sort, who was contemptuously reiected, despised, and persecuted euen to the deathe by the highe Priestes, by the Lawiers, by the Scribes, by the Maisters and Rabbines: for this cause Christe himselfe also chose his Apostles, not Rabbines, not Scribes, not Maisters, not Priestes, but vnlearned parsons of the rude people, voyde well neare of al knowledge, vnskilful, and Asses. But lest that some man may falsly accuse me, because I haue called the Apostles Asses, we wil discourse in fewe woordes the mysteries of the Asse, makinge a little disgression, but not form the pourpose: for the Doctours of the Hebrewes say that this beast is an example of fortitude and strength, patience, and clemencie, & that his influence dependeth on Sephiroth, very necessarie for a disciple of wisdome, he liueth by little forrage, & is contented therewith whatsoeuer it be, he can very well endure penurie, hunger, laboure, stripes, rechlesnes, and very wel sufferinge all peasecution, of a very simple & poore vnderstanding that he canot discerne fro thistels, of an incent and cleane hart, & without choler, hauing peace with al liuing creatures, & he is paciet, bearinge all burdens on his backe, for a rewarde of which he wanteth lice, he is seldome sicke, & liueth longer then any other beaste. The Asse as Columella saithe, doth many laboures aboue his part, because he easily breaketh the earth with the plough, & draweth many heuy cartes. Mareouer almoste the ordinarie laboure of this beaste is to drawe in milles, and grinde corne, euery countrie needeth so necessary an instrumete as the Asse is, which conueniently can drawe with his necke & carrie on his backe into the citie many necessaries. What auailable messenger ye Asse is in Augurie, Varro witnesseth of. C Marius, who in time paste subdued the South and the Northe, at the length declared an enimie to his countrie, and persecuted by Scylla, with the counsaile, by guide of an Asse he escaped the threatninges of Scylla, and had an Asse the causer of his slight, and salftie. And in the olde. Testamet God so honoured an Asse, that when he commanded euery firste begoten to be slaine for sacrifice, he fauoured Asses and men alone, grauntinge that man should heredeemed for price, and that a sheede should be chaunged for the Asse: Christ woulde that this beaste shoulde be a witnesse of his natiuitee, and hereof is a stedfast sam, and in him he woulde be saued from the handes of Herode, and the Asse also was consecrated by the touching of h[illeg.] of Christe, and honoured with the signe of the crosse: for Christe ascendinge to Ierusalem to triumphe for the redemption of mankind, as the Euangelists witnesse, rode vpon this beaste, as this was fore she wed in a greate mysterie by the Oracle of Zacharie, and it is read that Abraham father of the clect, rode onely vpon Asses, so that this olde Prouerbe emonge the people is not spoken in vaine, whiche saithe: that the Asse carieth mystertes, wherefore I will now aduertise you famous professours of sciences, naye rather Cumane Asses, that if the vnprofitable burdens of humane knowledges be not set aparte, and that Lyons borowed skinne put of, (not of the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, but of him whiche goeth about howlinge, and seeking whome be may deuoure) yee be not tourned againe into bare and mere Asses, that yee be vtterly and altogeather vnprofitable to carrie the mysteries of diuine wisdome: neither had that Apuleius of Megara, euer bene admitted to ye holy mysteries of Isis, if first he had not of a Philosopher ben tourned into an Asse. We reade the miracles of diuers beasts, ye an Elephant wrote the Greeke letters, and Plutarch writeth of an other beinge riuall or fellow louer with Aristophanes the Grammarian, ye was inamored of a mayden called Stephanopolides, and in the same authour, we reade of a Dragon that loued a maiden of Etholia, and that this beaste saued his nourisher, and many beleued that he ran to him, whose voyce he knewe. And Plinie We reade, that a Serpent called Aspis, was accustomed to come daiely to a certaine mans table, who after he had perceiued that the hoste his sonne was slaine by one of his dogges, for the punishmente of friendly hospitalitee disteyned, he slewe the dogge, nor euer after for shame came to that house againe. The same authoure saithe: that a panter thanked a man for bringinge her whelpes out of a ditche, and bringinge him out of the deserte, set him in the beaten waie. It is writen also in Histories, that Cyrus was nourished by a Bitche, and the builders of the citie of Rome by a shee Wolfe, when they were layed in a woode to the entente they should perishe, I passe ouer the miracles of the Dolphines, and the acknowledged pleasures, and acquited good turnes of the Lyons. I speake not of the Beare of Daunia, and the Ore of Tarentum surpasseth the admiration of all monsters, Ammonius of Alexandria, a great Philosopher in his time, master of Origen & Porphyrie, is reade to haue had an Asse hearer of his wisdome, fellow scholer with them. Wee knowe also by the sacred Historie of the Bible, that an asse sometime was endewed with ye spirit of prophecie: for when Balaam a wise man and a Prophet went foorth to curse the people of Israell, he sawe not the Angel of the Lord, but the Asse sawe him, & with a mans voyce spake vnto Balaam that rode on him. So saie I, the simple and rude idiote doth oftentimes see those things, whiche a Schole Doctoure corupted with the traditions of men cannot perceiue. Is it not true that Sampson with the cheeke bone of an Asse, strake and slew the Philistians: and beinge thirstie, he prayed to the Lorde, who losened a to the in the iawe of the Asse, and cleane water ranne out, which when he had droncken, his spirites and strength were refreshed? Did not Christe, in the mouthe of his simple Asses and rude ideotes his Apostles & Disciples, ouercome and strike al the Philosophers of the Gentiles, and Lawiers of the Iewes, and ouerthrewe, & caste vnder foote all mannes wisedome, drinckinge to vs out of that cheeke bene of his Asses, the water of wisdome and euerlastinge life. By these thinges then whiche are already said, it is more manifest then ye sonne, that there is no beaste of able to receiue diuinitee as the Asse, into whome if yee shall not be tourned, yee shall not be able to carrie the diuine misteries. In times past emonge the Romaines the proper name of th Christians was that they shoulde be called Asinarij, and they were wonte to paint the Image of Christe with the eares of an Asse: a witnes hereof is Tertullian: wherefore let not Bishops and Ministers disdeigne nor repute it to theire shame if amonge these Giauntlike Elephantes of Sciences they be Asses and so are called, neither let the Christian people woder, if emong those Prelates of Churches & erpert Doctours, the better learned one is, the lesse he be esteemed emong the reste, for the songes and harmonies of Nightingales belonge not to the eares of Asses, and it is in a Prouerbe that the vnpleasaunte and vntunable rornge of Asses doth not agree with the harpe: and yet the beste pipes be made of the bones of Asses, if the marowe be taken out of them, whiche beinge blowen do very muche surpasse and excell the sweetest soundes of euery harpe and harmonie: so these religious idiotes do surmounte and excede al the wrangling & babling Sophisters with theire aslike noise. So we reade of some Philosophers of the gentils whiche came to see Anthonie to dispute with him, and being conuinced by him in fewe woordes departed with shame and bashefulnesse. We reade also that a certayne simple Ideote ouercame and brought againe to the Faithe a very will learned and a subtill Hereticke, whome the best learned men and Bishops whiche were assembled at the Counsaile of Nice with a longe and difficulte disputation coulde not outcome. He beinge afterwarde demaunded of his friendes howe he had yeelded to the Ideote or vnlearned man, for so muche as he had resisted so many of the beste learned Bishops, he aunsweared that he had easily geuen the Bishops woordes for woordes, but that he coulde not resiste this Ideote whiche spake not according to mans wisdome, but accordinge to the spirite. Wherefore Dyee Asses, which are now with your Children vnder the commaundement of Christ by his Apostles the messengers and readers of true wisdome in his holy Gospel, be you lewsed from the darkenes of the flesh and bloude, if ye desire to attaine to this diuine and true wisedome not of ye tree of the knowledge of good & ill, but of the tree of life, the traditions of men set aparte, and euery search & discourse of the flesh & blovd whatsoeuer it be, whether it be conuersaunt in the reasons of talke, or in the consideration of causes, or in ye meditations of workes & effects, now entring not into ye scholes of Philosophers and Sophisters, but into your selues, ye shal knowe all things: for the knowledge of all things is compacte in you, which (as the Academickes cofesse) the holy Scriptures do so witnes, bicause God created al things very good, ye is to say in ye best degree, wherin thei might abide: euen as he than hath created trees ful of fruites, so also hath he created the soules as reasonable trees ful of formes & knowledges, but thorow the sinne of the first parent al things were reueled, & obliuion the mother of ignorauce stept in. Set you than now aside, whiche may, the veyle of your vnderstading, which are wrapped in the darknes of ignoraunce. Cast out ye drincke of Lethe you whiche haue maoe your selfes drencken with forgetfulnes, a waite for the true light you which haue suffered your selues to be taken with vnreasonable sleepe, & soorthwith when your face is disconered ye shall passe from the light to the light:for (as Iohn saith) ye are annoynted by ye holy Ghoste, & haue knowne al things, & againe ye neede not to be taught of any, because his annoynting teacheth you all thinges. It is he alone that geueth speache and wisdome. Dauid, Esaie, Ezechiel, Hieremie, Daniel, Iohn Baptiste, and Many other Prophetes and Apostles were not learned, but of shepherdes of husbandmenne, and of Idiotes thei became passingly wel learned in al thinges. Salomon in one nights dreame was replenished with the wisedome of all thinges aboue and beneth: and also with the prudecy of executing matters, so that none was comparable to him. And al these menne were mortal euen as you be, and sinners also. Perhaps you will saye that this hath chaunced to a very few. And a few childerne of God coulde attaine to it whome righteous Ioue hath loued: or resplendet vertue hathe brought to heauen. But despaire not, the Lordes hande is not shortned to all them whiche cal vpon him, which serue him faithfully. Anthonie, and ye barbarous Christian seruaunt, of tayned the knowledge of diuine things thorow the prayer of three daies, as Augustine witnesseth. But you which cannot togeather with the prophetes, with the Apostles, & with those holy men beholde those thinges with a cleare and pure vnderstanding, seeke ye to haue vnderstanding of them which haue seene them with cleare sighte: this waye remaineth to be searched for (as Hierome saith to Rufinus) to the end that which the spirit hath taught the Prophetes and Apostles, shoulde be sought by you with the studie of learninge, of that learning I meane which is taught in Gods Woord, & with a vniuersal consente of the Churche approued, not that whiche hath bene inuented by the wittes of men, because that doth not lighten ye vnderstanding, but maketh it darke. Where we muste haue recourse to Moses, to the Prophetes, to Salomon, to the Euangelistes, and to the Apostles, which shininge with al kinde of learning, wisdome, maners, tonges, prophecies, oracles, miracles, and holines, haue spoken of diuine things from God himself, and of inferiour thinges aboue men, and haue brought to open light all the secretes of God & nature. For al the secretes of God and nature, al the manner of customes and lawes, al the knowledge of thinges present, paste, and to come, are taughte in the holy Scriptures of the Bible. Whither then renne you headlonge, which seeke knowledge of them, whiche haue spente all theire life time in searchinge it, & haue lost time and labour, and coulde not finde any truth? O yee fooles & wicked ones, which setting apart the giftes of ye holy Ghost, endeuour to learne those thinges of saitheles Philosophers, & masters of errours, whiche ye ought to receiue of God, and the holy Ghoste. Will you beleue that we can gette knowledge out of the ignoraunce of Socrates? lighte out of the darkenes of Anaxagoras? vertue out of the pitte of Democritus? prudencie out of the madnes of Empedocles? Carneades and Archesilaus, wisedome out of wicked Aristotle & faithlesse Auerroes? beleefe out of the superstition of the Platonickes? you erre very muche, & be deceaued by these which haue ben deceaued. But descende into your selues you whiche are desirous of the truthe, departe from the cloudes of mans traditions, and cleaue to the true light: beholde a voice from Heauen, a voice that teacheth from aboue, and sheweth you more clearly then the Sunne, why are you your owne enimies, and prolonge time to receaue wisdome? heere the oracle of Baruch: God is as he was & no other shalbe esteemed with him, he hath founde out all manner of learninge, and hathe geuen to Iacob his childe, and Israell his beloued, geuinge Lawes and commaundements, and ordayning Sacrifices: after this he was seene on the Earth, and was conuersaunt with men, that is to saie, takinge fleashe, and with an open mouthe teachinge those thinges, which vnder darke questions he hath taught in the Lawe and Prophetes. And to be ende that you maye not thinke, that these thinges be referred to diuine thinges onely, and not to naturall, heere what the wise man witnesseth of him selfe: It is he that hath geuen me the true knowledge of those thinges whiche are that I might know the dispositions of the copasse of the Earth, the vertue of the Elementes, the beginninge, ginninge, consummation, middle, and reuolutions of times, the course of the yeare, the dispositions of the Starres, the natures of liuinge Creatures, the anger of beastes, the force of the windes, the thoughtes of men, the differences of plantes, the vertues of rootes, and finally I haue learned al the thinges which be hidden and vnknowen, for the Artificer of all thinges hath taught me wisedome. The Diuine wisdome neuer faileth, nothinge escapeth it, nothinge augmenteth it, but comprehendeth al things. Understande you therefore now, that there needeth not muche labour in this place, but Faithe and Praier: not the studie of longe time, but humblenes of Spirite and cleannesse of Harte: not the sumptuous furniture of many bookes, but a pure vnderstanding, and made fitte for the truthe as the keye is for the locke: for the great number of bookes chargeth the learner, instructeth him not, and he that followeth many authours erreth with many. All thinges are contained and taught in the onely volume of the holy Bible, but vnder this condition ye they be not perceaued but by them which are made cleare: to others they be parables, and darke made faste with many seales. Praie then to the Lorde God in faith doubtinge nothinge, that the Lambe of the tribe of Iuda maie come, and open to you the sealed booke, whiche Lambe alone is holy and true, which alone hath the keye of knowledge and discretion, which openeth and no man shutteth, whiche shutteth and no man can open. This is Iesus Christe, the woorde and sonne of God the father and blessed wisdome, the true Master made man as wee are, that he might make vs the childern of God as he is, whiche is blessed for euer. But leaste that thorow vsing more woordes I shoulde declame as it is saide, beyonde the hower, let this be the ende of our Oration. FINIS.
