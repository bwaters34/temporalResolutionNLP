"This is a mystery of the deep sea, Please you to hear it? You will not marvel much, For he that made it hath a mighty power, Calling up wondrous forms and images. Art cannot compass." \--- Old Play . It was on a pleasant day in the month of September, that I received a notification from the captain of a small vessel, in which my passage for a distant port had been engaged, apprising me of his intention to sail immediately. I had been already delayed for some days, the wind being in our teeth; and, though still loth, as all young travellers usually are, to leave home for the first time, the suspense and impatience from waiting had been such, that the hurrying call had the effect of something like a pleasurable reprieve upon my mind, and I instantly obeyed it. A few moments sufficed to complete my preparations, and in two hours all hands were on board, and the little swallow-like packet, under out-spread wings, and a clear and beautiful sky, was rapidly leaving the land. We had but two [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-002.jpg) \- external link  - Page 265. ] passengers beside myself, both equally young, and equally new to the perils and mysteries of the sea; and for a moderately long voyage, the prospects of enjoyment were rather more limited than was desirable. We were soon conscious of our mutual dependence, and accordingly we entered into a determination, each of us, to do our little for the common comfort and gratification. What with striding the narrow deck, half the time in the way of one another--- watching the land of our birth-place and homes fast receding from our eyes, and calculating, with many doubts, the various chances of our voyage, we contrived, as may be supposed, to get through the first day very amicably, and with tolerable satisfaction. We were now fairly at sea. The plane of ocean became rapidly undulated and more buoyant. Broad swells of water bore our bark like a shell, sportively upon their bosoms, then sinking with equal suddenness from beneath, left it to plunge and struggle in the deep hollows, until borne up by other and succeeding billows. Space and density, in glorious contrast and comparison, were all at once before us, in the blue world of vacuity hanging and stretching above, and the immense, seldom quiet, and murmuring mass spread out below it. The land no longer met our eyes, though strained and stretched to the utmost. The clouds came down, and hung about us, narrowing the horizon to a span, and mingling gloomily with the surges that kept howling perpetually around us, growing at each moment more and more threatening and restless. Not a speck [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-003.jpg) \- external link  - Page 266. ] besides our own little vessel was to be seen amidst that wide infinity, that, admirably consorted, was at once beneath, above, around, and about us. Two days went by in this manner, with scarcely any alteration in the monotonous character of the prospect. Still the weather was fine---the clouds that gathered between, formed a shelter from the intensity of a tropical sun, and, in that warm time and region, were a positive luxury. But, towards the evening of the third day, there was a hazy red crown about the sun as he sunk behind the swell in our front---a curling and increasing motion of the black waters, rushed impetuously forward into the wild cavern into which he descended---the wind freshened, and took to itself a melancholy and threatening tone, as it sung at intervals among the spars and cordage; and, while it continued of itself, momentarily, to change its burden, appeared, with a fine mystery, to warn us of a yet greater change in the aspect and temper of the dread elements, all clustering around us. The old seamen looked grave and weather-wise, and shook their heads sagaciously, when questioned about the prospect. The captain strode the deck impatiently and anxiously, giving his orders in a tone that left little doubt on my mind, of a perfect familiarity, on the part of the ancient voyageur , with the undeceptive and boding countenance of sea and sky. Night came on, travelling hurriedly, and cloaked up in impenetrable gloom. The winds continued to freshen and increase; and but a single [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-004.jpg) \- external link  - Page 267. ] star, hanging out like hope, shot a glance of promise and encouragement through the pitchy and threatening atmosphere. The prospect was quite too uncheering to permit of much love, or many looks on the part of fresh-water seamen. By common consent, we went below, and ransacking our trunks, were enabled to conjure up a pack of cards, with which, to the no small inconvenience of our captain, we sought to shut out from thought any association with the dim and dismal prospect we had just been contemplating. He did not, it is true, request us to lay aside our amusement, but he annoyed us excessively by his mutterings on the subject. He bade us beware, for that we were certainly bringing on a storm. He had seen it tried, very often, he assured us, to produce such an effect, and he had never known it fail. His terrors brought us the very amusement for which he was unwilling we should look to such devilish enginery as a pack of cards. We had not needed this, to convince us that the seaman was rather more given to superstition than well comported with the spirit of the age. He was a Connecticut man, thoroughly imbued with blue laws, Cotton Mather, &c., and all the tales of demonology and witchcraft, ever conceived or hatched in that most productive of all countries in the way of notions. He lectured us freely and frequently upon his favorite topic, on which much familiarity had even made him eloquent. We encouraged him in his failing, and derived our sport from its indulgence. Believing fervently himself every syllable he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-005.jpg) \- external link  - Page 268. ] uttered, he could not understand our presumption in doubting, as we sometimes did, many of the veracious and marvellous legends of New-England and the "Sound," which he volunteered for our edification; and when at length, convinced of the utter impossibility of overthrowing what, no doubt, he considered the heresy of our scepticism, he appeared to resign himself to the worst of fates. He evidently regarded each of us as a Jonah, not less worthy of the water and whale than his prototype of old; and, I make not the slightest question, would have tumbled us all overboard, without a solitary scruple, should the helm refuse to obey, or the masts go by the board. His stories, however, I am free to confess for myself, and I may say for my companions also, however our philosophy might be disposed to laugh at the matter, had a greater influence upon all of us than we were willing to admit to one another. Upon me, in particular, the impression produced was peculiar in its character. Not that, for a single moment, I could persuade myself, or be persuaded by others, that the mere playing of any game whatever could bring down upon us the wrath of Heaven, or "hatch a fiendish form upon the deep," but naturally disposed to live and breathe only in an "element of fiction and fantastic change," I drank in every thing savoring of the marvellous with an earnest and yielding spirit. He seemed to have been born and to have lived all his life in a "witch element." He had stories, filled and worked by this principle, of every section of the world in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-006.jpg) \- external link  - Page 269. ] which he had sojourned or travelled. He had seen the old boy himself, in the shape of a black pigeon, in a squall off the capes of Delaware; and once, on the night of the twenty-seventh June, had himself counted the phantom-ships of the British fleet, under Sir Peter Parker, as they were towed over the bar of Charleston, in South Carolina, to the attack of Fort Moultrie. What seemed to vex him the most of these things was, that the Carolinians, whom he pronounced a most obstinate and unteachable race, refused to believe a word of the matter. But his favorite legend, and that which he believed as honestly as the best authenticated chapter in scripture, was that of the Flying Dutchman, who was driven out of the German Ocean; and in process of time, and for some such offence, was doomed to a like travail with the wandering Jew. This identical visionary he had seen more than once, and on one occasion had nearly suffered by speaking him. It was only by dint of good fortune and bad weather that he escaped unseen by that dreadful voyageur, to be noticed by whom is peril of storm and wreck and utter destruction. It was of this dangerous sail he had now to warn us. We were told that this sea, and almost the very portion which we now travelled, was that in which the Dutchman, at this season, usually sojourned for the exercise, with more perfect freedom, of his manifold vagaries---a power being given him, according to our worthy captain, for the due and proper punishment of those who, when his spirit was abroad upon the waters, dared [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-007.jpg) \- external link  - Page 270. ] to palter and trifle in idle games, sport, and buffoonery. The voyageur evidently apprehended much, and as the gale freshened, his countenance grew more gloomy, and his words more importunate in reference to those levities and sports which we had fallen into. To pacify him we forbore, and were compelled to refer to other resources for the recreation which we required at such a time. There were three of us, and we told our several stories. The youngest of our trio was young indeed. He was tall, slender, graceful; eminently beautiful, a highly intelligent mind, and a finely wrought and susceptible spirit. He was deeply in love, truly devoted to the young maiden, and the short time contemplated to elapse before they should again meet, was one of great and bitter privation. Becoming intimate from the circumstances of our situation, and probably from certain innate sympathies, we learned all these particulars from his own lips. He described the charms of his mistress, gave us the entire history of his connection, his hopes and fears and prospects; and, in turn, we were equally communicative. His name was Herbert. The storm increased, and with so much violence, that we were fain to go upon the deck, impatient of our restraint below, though by no means secure, even with ropes and bulwarks and a tenacious grasp above. I shall never forget the awful splendor, the fearful, the gorgeous magnificence of that prospect. In the previous ten minutes the gale had increased to a degree of violence that would not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-008.jpg) \- external link  - Page 271. ] permit us to hang out a rag of sail, and the vessel, under her bare poles, was driving upon and through the black and boiling waters. Nothing was now to be seen but the great deeps, and vast and ponderous bulk and body which groaned with its own huge and ungovernable labors. Horrible abysses opened before us, monstrous and ravenous billows rushed after us in awful gambols. Mountains gathering upon mountains, clustering and clashing together, threw up from the dreadful collision tall spiry columns of white foam, that keeping its position for a few seconds would rush down towards us, like some god of the sea, bestriding the billows, and directing their furies for our destruction. Under such impulses we drove on, with a recklessness fully according with the dread spirit that presided over the scene; now darting through the waters, occasionally rushing beneath them, then emerging and throwing off the spray, that shone upon the black and terrific picture, in a contrast as grotesque as the tinsel ornaments upon the robe of a tyrant, in the thick of the battle, or at the execution of thousands. On a sudden our course was arrested by a mountain of water, under which our vessel labored. She broke through the impediment, however, with a fearful energy. Another sea came on, which we shipped, and the bark reeled without power beneath the stroke. I was thrown from my feet, and seized with difficulty by the side, the water rushing in volumes over me. Again she sprung up and righted, but with a shock that again lost [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-009.jpg) \- external link  - Page 272. ] me the possession of my hold. At that moment a shriek of agony rushed through my senses; and immediately beside me a passenger, one of my companions, torn from his hold, was swept over the side, into the unreturning ocean. He passed but a foot from me, in his progress to the deep. How terrible was his cry of death---it will never pass out of my memory. He grasped desperately at my arm as he approached me. He would have dragged me with him to death, but I shrunk back; and his look--- the gleam of his eye---its vacantly horrible expression will never leave me. The vessel rushed on, unheeding; and I saw him borne by the waves buoyantly for many yards in her wake before he sunk. He called upon Heaven, and the winds howled in his ears, and the waters mocked his supplications. Down he went, with one husky cry that the seas stifled; and the agony was over. That cry brought a chilling presentiment to my heart. Despair was in it to all. Though I seemed to live under a like influence, there was a degree of strange recklessness even in our scrupulous captain, for which I could not, and indeed did not seek to account. I felt assured we could not long survive. Our vessel groaned and labored fearfully; her seams opened, and the water came bubbling and hissing in, as if impatient of their prey. Still she went on, the violence of the storm contributing to the buoyancy of the billows, and aiding her in keeping afloat. But, amidst all this rage and tumult, the strife of warring and vexed elements, there was yet one [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page 273. ] moment in which we were under a universal calm; one awful moment afforded, seemingly by the demon who had roused the tempest, that we might be enabled adequately to comprehend our situation. The feeling in this extremest moment was the same with all on board, with no exception; and one unanimous prayer went up to heaven. It was but a moment. The winds and the waves went forth with redoubled violence and power. There seemed an impelling tempest from every point of the compass. Suddenly a broad and vivid flash of lightning illuminated the black and boiling surges; lingering upon them sufficiently long to give us a full glance of the scene. Immediately in our course, came a large and majestic vessel. She had no sails, but pursued a path directly in the teeth of the tempest. She came down upon us with the swiftness of an eagle. Her decks were bare, as if swept by a thousand seas--- we were right in her path---there was no veering, no change of course---no hope. the voice of the captain rose above the tempest---it had a horror which the storm itself lacked. It spoke of the utter despair, which was the feeling of all of us alike. "The Flying Dutchman," was all he could say, ere the supposed phantom was over us. I felt the shock---a single crash---and crew, cargo, vessel, all---were down, crushed and writhing beneath its superior weight, struggling with, and finally sinking beneath the exulting waters. But where was she, the mysterious bark that had destroyed us?--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 274. ] gone, gone! no trace of her progress, except our broken fragments---our sinking hopes. There had been no time for preparation or for prayer. The fatal stranger had gone clean over, or, indeed, through us; and, though sinking myself, it appeared to me that I could see her keel, with a singular facility of optical penetration, cutting the green mountains behind me, with the velocity of an arrow. Around me, scattered and sinking with myself, I beheld the fragments of our vessel, together with the struggling atoms of our crew and company. Among these, floating near me, on a spar, I recognized the fair and melancholy features of young Herbert, the passenger, whose love affair I have already glanced at. I felt myself sinking, and seized upon him convulsively. The spar upon which he rested veered round, and, grasping it firmly, I raised my body to the surface. He felt conscious of its inadequacy to the task of supporting both of us, and strove to divert its direction from me. But in vain. Neither of us could prove capable of much, if any generosity, on such an occasion, and at such a time. Our grasp became more firm; and, while death and desolation and a nameless horror enveloped every thing in which we were the sole surviving occupants, we were enemies, deadly and avowed enemies--- we, who had exchanged vows of the warmest friendship---to whom our several hopes and prospects had been unfolded with a confidence the most pure and unqualified---we sought each other's destruction, as the only hope in which our own [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 275. ] lives could repose. He appealed to me with tears--- spoke of the young girl who awaited him---the joys that were promised---the possibility of both surviving, if I would swim off to a neighboring spar which he strove to point out to me. But I saw no spar; I felt that he strove to deceive me, and I became indignant with his hypocrisy. What was his love to me? I laughed with a fierce fury in his face. I too had loves and hopes, and I swore that I would not risk further a life so precious in so many ways. The waters seemed to comprehend our situation--- a swell threw us together, and our grasp was mutual. My hand was upon his throat with the gripe and energy of despair; his arms, in turn, wound about my body. I strangled him. I held on, till all his graspings, all his struggles, and every pulsation had entirely ceased. My strength, as if in close correspondence and sympathy with the spirit that prompted me, seemed that of a demon. In vain did he struggle. Could he hope to contend with the fiend of self, that nerved and corded every vein and muscle of my body? Fool that he was, but such was not his thought. He uttered but a single name---but a brief word---through all our contest. That name was the young girl's, who had his pledges and his soul---that word was one of prayer for her and her happiness; and I smiled scornfully even in our grapple of death, at the pusillanimity of his boyish heart. I had aspirations, too, and I mocked him with the utterance of ambitious hopes. I told him of my anticipated triumphs; I predicted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 276. ] my own fame and future glory, and asked the value of his worthless life, in comparison with mine. He had but one answer to all this, and that consisted in the repetition of the beloved one's name. This but deepened my frenzy and invigorated my hate. Had he uttered but one ambitious desire---had he been stimulated by one single dream of glory or of greatness, I had spared his life. But there was something of insolence in the humility of his aim that provoked my deepest malignity. I grappled him more firmly than ever, and withdrew not my grasp, until, by a flash of lightning, I beheld him blacker than the wild waters dashing around us. I felt the warm blood gush forth upon my hands and arms from his mouth and nostrils, and he hung heavily upon me. Would the deed had not been done. Would I might have restored him; but the good spirit came too late for his hope and for my peace. I shrunk from my victim. I withdrew my grasp---not so he. The paroxysm of death had confirmed the spasmodic hold, which, in the struggle, he had taken of my body. My victory was something worse than defeat. It was not merely death---it was the grave and its foul associations--- its spectres and its worms, and they haunt me for ever. We were supported by the buoyancy of the ocean alone, while under the violence of its dread excitements; and I felt assured that the relaxation to repose of the elements, would carry us both down together. Vainly did I struggle to detach myself [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 277. ] from his grasp. Freed from one hand, the other would suddenly clasp itself about my neck, with a tenacity only increased by every removal. His face was thrust close into my own---the eyes lit up by supernatural fires glaring in my own; while the teeth, chattering in the furious winds, kept up a perpetual cry of death---death---death---until I was mad---wild as the waters about me, and shricking almost as loudly in concert with the storm. Fortunately, however, I had but little time for the contemplation of these terrors. The agony of long suspense was spared me. The storm was over. The spar on which I floated, no longer sustained by the continuous swell, settled, at length, heavily down in its pause, and without an effort, I sunk bebeath the waters, the corpse of my companion changing its position, and riding rigidly upon my shoulders. Ten thousand ships had not sustained me under such a pressure. The waters went over me with a roar of triumph, and I felt, with Clarence, how "horrid 't was to drown." Even at that moment of dread and death, the memory of that vivid picture of the dramatist came to my senses, as I realized all its intensely fearful features in my own fate. What was that fate? The question was indeed difficult of solution, for I did not perish. I was not deprived of sense or feeling, though shut in from the blessed air, and pressed upon and surrounded by the rolling and yet turbulent waters. For leagues, apparently, could I behold the new domain into which I was now perforce a resident, the cold corpse [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf357&image=357-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 278. ] still hanging loosely but firmly about my shoulders. I settled at length upon a rock of a broad surface, which in turn rested upon a fine gravelly bed of white sand. Shrinking and sheltering themselves in innumerable crevices of the rocks around me, from the violence of the storm that had raged above, I was enabled in a little time to behold the numberless varieties of the finny tribe that dwelt in the mighty seas. Many were the ferocious monsters by which I was surrounded; and from which I was only safe through the influence of their own terrors. There were huge serpents, lions, and tigers of the ocean. There roved the angry and ever hungry shark---his white teeth, showing like the finest saws, promising little pause in the banquet on his prey. There leapt the lively porpoise---there swam the sword-fish, and galloped the sea-horse. They were not long in their advances; I saw the sea-wolf prepare to spring---the shark darted like an arrow on my path, and, with a horror too deep for expression, I struck forth into the billows, and strove once more for the upper air. A blow, from what quarter I know not, struck the corpse from my shoulders, and was spent upon my head. My body was seized by a power in whose grasp all vigor was gone, and every muscle relaxed. On a sudden the entire character of the scene was altered. My enemies assumed a new guise and appearance, and in place of fish and beast and reptile, I perceived myself closely surrounded by a crowd of old and young ladies, busily employed with a dozen smelling bottles, which they [
