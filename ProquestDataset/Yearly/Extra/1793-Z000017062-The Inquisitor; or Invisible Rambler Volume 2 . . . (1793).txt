[s]aid I, looking at him with an eye of compa[s][s]ion as he went out of the apartment--- Poor fellow! thou ha[s]t been hardly u[s]ed by one man who called him[s]elf a Chri[s]tian, and it makes thee [s]u[s]pect the whole race---But, [s]urely, [s]aid I, it is not a man's barely pro[s]e[s][s]ing Chri[s]tianity that makes him worthy that character; a man mu[s]t behave with humanity, not only to his fellow-creatures, but to the animal creation, before he can be ranked with propriety among that exalted cla[s]s of mortals. The man who with unmerciful hand [s]courges his [s]lave, does he then remember that the per[s]on he is cha[s]ti[s]ing is endowed with the [s]ame [s]en[s]e of feeling as him[s]elf, and is as [s]en[s]ible of pain, hunger, thir[s]t, cold, aye, and all the [s]ocial ble[s][s]ings of life? has filial, conjugal, and paternal affection?---then why, becau[s]e he is a [s]lave, [s]hould you be[s]tow on him painful [s]tripes, when your[s]elf would [s]hrink to receive but the [s]malle[s]t of them---Does the name of Slave,--- Slave! [s]aid I, ri[s]ing as I [s]poke, while the sanguine tide that plays about my heart ru[s]hed unbidden to my cheeks--- Why did I blu[s]h, why did I tremble, as I pronounced the word [s]lave?---It was becau[s]e I was a[s]hamed of the appellation---It is a word that [s]hould never be u[s]ed between man and man---The negro on the burning [s]ands of Africa was born as free as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] him who draws his fir[s]t breath in Britain---and [s]hall a Chri[s]tian, a man who[s]e mind is enlightened by education and religion, for a little [s]ordid pel[s], [s]ell the freedom of this poor negro, only becau[s]e he differs from him in complexion---what right has an European to [s]ell an African? do they leave their native land and [s]eek our coa[s]t, by arts entice our countrymen away, and make them [s]laves?--- I walked out and endeavoured to di[s][s]ipate the di[s]agreeable reflection; but the idea of [s]lavery pursued me [s]till. Unhappy man, [s]aid I, as bu[s]y fancy drew out the [s]ad [s]cene. She held up to my mind's eye a man born to a good inheritance, and [s]urrounded with all the comforts, all the ble[s][s]ings, he de[s]ired---but he was a negro. He was [s]itting in his little hut, his jetty companion by his [s]ide; one infant at her brea[s]t, two others prattling at her knee; [s]he looked, [s]he felt happy. Her hu[s]band, her children, were with her; [s]erenity played on every countenance; content had fixed her habitation in their dwelling---Some Europeans enter--- they deck his beloved children with baubles--- they tie beads round the arms of his wife---and ornament her jetty locks with glittering toys---He is charmed with their courte[s]y---He walks with them to the [s]ea [s]ide, and takes his boy, his elde[s]t darling, with him---they invite them on board the ve[s][s]el--- Poor [s]oul! un[s]u[s]pecting their treachery, he goes, and bids adieu to liberty for ever---His wife, taking advantage of his ab[s]ence, trims up their hut---lays her dear babes to [s]leep---and then prepares a supper for her love, compo[s]ed of whole[s]ome roots and fruit---She wonders why he [s]tays---She leaves her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] home and walks toward the [s]ea, [s]he [s]ees him embark--- her child goes too---the [s]ailors [s]pread the [s]ails--- the ve[s][s]el moves---[s]he [s]hrieks---but there my heart was wrung [s]o keenly, I could go no farther. I left the wife, and followed the poor negro---he had no comfort but the idea that he [s]hould be with his child; that he [s]hould have it in his power to ea[s]e him if heavy ta[s]ks were impo[s]ed, to guard him from dangers, and teach him to be re[s]igned and contented.--- They arrive at Barbadoes---they are expo[s]ed to [s]ale and allotted to different ma[s]ters. Alas! poor man, tears and intreaties are vain; you are in the hands of the [s]ons of Mammon. Fancy [s]till led me forward---I [s]aw him when age and infirmities came on without one comfort, without one friend, on a mi[s]erable bed, [s]ickne[s]s and [s]ad ren embrance his only companions---he is weary of life---he offers up a prayer for his [s]till dear companion, for his children, his haple[s]s en[s]laved child--- He dies---and is thrown into the grave without a prayer to con[s]ecrate the ground, without one tear of affection or regret being [s]hed upon his bier. Had not that poor negro a [s]oul? Yes---and in futurity it [s]hall appear white and [s]potle[s]s at the throne of Grace, to confound the man who called him[s]elf a Chri[s]tian, and yet betrayed a fellow-creature into bondage. It would give me a great deal of plea[s]ure, [s]aid I, to have the hi[s]tory of the Ea[s]t Indian[s]but when I have got it, how [s]hall I tran[s]late it---I know nothing of the language; but, perhaps I may be able to procure a per[s]on to tran[s]late it for me. How do you do? my good friend, [s]aid a man, rather [s]habbily dre[s][s]ed---Now I make it a rule never to turn my back on a man becau[s]e he had rather wear a thread-bare coat than run in debt with his taylor; [s]o I turned about to pre[s]ent my hand to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] per[s]on who addre[s][s]ed me with [s]uch cordiality, and perceived in him the features of an old [s]chool fellow. Ifear , [s]aid I, as we went forward---I fear you have not been [s]ucce[s]sful in gaining any permanent [s]ettlement---pray how have you di[s]po[s]ed of your[s]elf the[s]e la[s]t [s]even years? I have, he replied, been [s]trangely to[s][s]ed about, beheld various [s]cenes, tried many different plans, and been un[s]ucce[s]sful in all. When I left Oxford, I was recommended by a friend of my father's to be preceptor to the only [s]on of a man of large fortune---he was a [s]prightly, sensible lad, but exceedingly capricious in his humour, which was owing to his parent's never allowing him to be contradicted. For a month or fix weeks we went on very well; my young gentleman was fond of learning, took every thing with [s]urpri[s]ing facility, and gave me little or no trouble in obliging him to attend his book---but the unbounded applau[s]e he received from his parents, the care[s][s]es and indulgences they were continually heaping on him, and the prai[s]e every ca[s]ual gue[s]t was obliged to be[s]tow on this darling of the family, [s]oon made him think he was as learned as any of the [s]even wife men of Greece, and therefore had no farther need of a preceptor. When I found he grew carele[s]s and neglectful, I thought a little correction might be nece[s][s]ary; but, on trying the experiment, was called by the over fond mother, an inhuman mon[s]ter; and the father thought his boy had a genius too bright to require [s]uch rough methods of proceeding. In [s]hort, Sir, having no power over the child, he [s]oon lo[s]t what little learning he had at fir[s]t attained; and I was di[s]mi[s][s]ed with the character of having ruined the boy's genius by ill-timed and unmerciful correction. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] As I had taken orders, I lived for [s]ome time by occa[s]ionally reading prayers, or preaching for a vicar who was very old and infirm, but having a large family, could not well afford to pay a con[s]tant curate.--- In the cour[s]e of this time I became acquainted with a young lady po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of every virtue that might render her a de[s]irable companion; add to this, [s]he had two hundred pounds in her own po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and lived with an uncle, who, be[s]ide an affluent fortune, had an excellent living in his gift---the old incumbent of which was in a very declining [s]tate of health---had Maria been poor I [s]hould have loved her; but I [s]hould never have thought of marrying her in the circum[s]tances I then was, as I knew it mu[s]t involve us both in mi[s]ery. She was all gentleness; and while [s]he thought the [s]entiment [s]he felt for me was only pity for my precarious, disagreeable [s]ituation, it by degrees ripened into a tender and la[s]ting affection.---Her uncle had ever [s]tudied her happine[s]s, and thinking it would [s]oon be in his power to [s]ettle us both in an ea[s]y, de[s]irable living, he encouraged my preten[s]ions, and in a few months made me the hu[s]band of Maria. It would be needle[s]s to mention the happine[s]s I enjoyed for eight months with this amiable woman; [s]uffice it to [s]ay, I envied not the wealthie[s]t or mo[s]t oppulent man in Europe. But our happine[s]s was too great to be permanent---her uncle had ever been a man of [s]ound con[s]titution, and though then in the [s]ixtieth year of his age, gave no [s]igns of infirmity or decay: but, alas! who can depend on [s]o frail a thing as life.---One morning having waited breakfast till near ten o'clock, [s]urpri[s]ed at the old gentleman's lying [s]o long, as he was in general an early rifer, I tapped at his chamber door, but received no an[s]wer. I opened it, and went in, and [s]ound he had taken his final leave of this world. I felt [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] myself extremely [s]hocked; but fearing for Maria, who, at that time was pregnant, I compo[s]ed my[s]elf, and going down, told her, that her uncle being rather indisposed, de[s]ired not to be di[s]turbed. On pretence of going for an apothecary I went and informed an intimate friend of Maria's with the melancholy affair. We determined [s]he [s]hould call and take Maria out, and by various methods keep her from home all day; when in the evening we would, by degrees, acquaint her with the [s]ad tidings--- But all the[s]e precautions were vain. During my ab[s]ence, one of the [s]ervants had entered the room, which in my agitated [s]tate of mind I had forgot to lock, and in[s]tantly alarmed her mi[s]tre[s]s. At my return I found my poor Maria in an agony of grief, which, however, was happily of no ill con[s]equence to her[s]elf or the infant. When my uncle was buried, we examined his papers, and no will being found, a di[s]tant male relation took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the whole e[s]tate. I removed with my wife from the hou[s]e; [s]till flattering myself when the old incumbent died I [s]hould have the living; but I was mi[s]taken. In a few months the old man paid the debt of nature, and the living was di[s]po[s]ed of to another per[s]on. Our di[s]appointment was very great---but the two hundred pounds Maria po[s][s]e[s][s]ed hindered us from being immediately expo[s]ed to want, but that [s]um was gradually decrea[s]ing---be[s]ide a child which was born [s]oon after my uncle's decea[s]e, Maria promised to make me father of another. At any other time this would have given me great plea[s]ure--- but the un[s]ettled [s]tate of my affairs made me regret that this poor little infant was coming into a world to inherit nothing but penury. About this time I was recommended to Lord Ernoff, who[s]e elde[s]t [s]on was going abroad, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] wanted a governor; however painful it might be to part with Maria, yet the promi[s]e of a hand[s]ome [s]alary led me to accept the propo[s]al. I left the dear woman, and [s]et out to make the tour of Europe with my young Lord.---I had been ab[s]ent from my native country three years, and found my[s]elf highly in favour with the young gentleman abroad, and his father at home---who, to recompen[s]e my fidelity to his [s]on, was continually heaping favours on Maria and the children. We were at Madrid, when my Lord commenced an intrigue with a woman of rank and reputation.--- It was in vain I repre[s]ented to him the dangerous con[s]equences that might en[s]ue from [s]uch an illicit amour.---The more I remon[s]trated, the more ob[s]tinate he appeared; and unfortunately [s]oon succeeded in ruining the object of his di[s]honorable pursuit. Having obtained every favour from the ea[s]y, thoughtle[s]s Leonilla, he was preparing to leave Madrid.--- She was informed of his de[s]ign (and the revenge of a Spani[s]h woman, when injured, being always adequate to the love they once bore their seducer) [s]he hired bravoes to di[s]patch this young nobleman the night preceding that appointed for our departure. We had dined out---and the evening being fine, preferred walking home rather than going in a carriage. I perceived two men watch and follow us through every [s]treet, till coming to one that was dark and unfrequented, one of the men came up and attempted to [s]tab my Lord.---I drew my [s]word, and aiming at the villain's heart, threw my[s]elf before the young nobleman, and received the poniard of the [s]econd assassin in my own bo[s]om. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] This little [s]cuffle having made [s]ome noi[s]e, people [s]oon gathered round, when the ruffians finding themselves di[s]appointed in their aims, made off.---My Lord thinking a longer [s]tay at Madrid would be dangerous, left me to the care of a [s]urgeon and nur[s]e, and departed next morning for Paris, from whence he propo[s]ed returning to England. My friend was proceeding in his narrative, when our attention was engaged by the appearance of a woman habited like a pilgrim, but in deep mourning--- [s]uch an appearance being uncommon in England, it naturally excited our curio[s]ity. We were in Ken[s]ington Gardens.--- The mourner's [s]tature was above the lower [s]ize, and there was a certain dignity about her which [s]poke her of no common rank---her features had once been lovely; and even now, though pale and marked with grief, there was a [s]omething in them that engaged the affections, and in[s]en[s]ibly drew the heart towards her.---She [s]eated her[s]elf upon the ground; and re[s]ting her elbow on the root of a tree--- her head reclining pen[s]ively on her hand---[s]he plucked up [s]ome wild dai[s]ies that grew round her--- it amu[s]ed her for the moment, but recollecting herself, [s]he cried--- They will [s]oon die, and I have killed them. The thought [s]eemed to give her exqui[s]ite pain.--- She dropped the dai[s]ies on the ground, and bur[s]t into tears. I will not look at them, [s]aid [s]he, ri[s]ing, and bending her [s]teps another way. Alas! poor [s]oul, [s]aid I, it is not the[s]e flowers you would fly from, it is your[s]elf and your own painful reflections. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] That is very true, [s]aid [s]he (turning towards me, and laying her hand on my arm) I would fain forget that I was the murderer of an innocent man---I am trying to expiate my fault by fa[s]ting and hard penance. I have come a pilgrimage of many hundred miles on foot, nor re[s]ted my weary limbs, but when nece[s][s]ity obliged me to cro[s]s the [s]ea.---If I could find the woman I have made a widow, and the children I have rendered orphans, I would do [s]omething to make their lives happy, and then return home, and devote my[s]elf to the Ble[s][s]ed Virgin. Alas, continued [s]he, [s]till re[s]ting on my arm, and laying her other hand on her heart---alas, you know not what a [s]ad thing it is to be an orphan. I once had a father---had he lived---but, poor man, he had been to the wars; and when he returned, he met my mother's corp[s]e ju[s]t going to the grave.---He wept not---he never once complained, but following in [s]ilence, [s]aw her interred---then laid him[s]elf down on the cold turf that covered her, and never ro[s]e again. Here [s]he [s]eemed quite lo[s]t---and leaving me abruptly, walked to a retired part of the garden. I never felt my pity [s]o [s]trongly excited as at this moment.---The whole tenor of the mourner's discourse and actions di[s]covered the di[s]order of her mind. She [s]eemed to have experienced a variety of misfortunes which had banithed fair rea[s]on from her throne. Poor girl, [s]aid I, how [s]everely mu[s]t your heart have been wrung before you were drove to this mi[s]erable [s]ituation! But come, [s]aid I, turning to my friend, fini[s]h your recital.---He attempted to [s]peak, but was forced to [s]top---[s]omething ro[s]e in his throat---I felt the [s]ame in mine---but what that was, I will leave to the imagination of every reader of [s]en[s]ibility. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] My Lord's departing from Madrid without me, continued my friend, occa[s]ioned a report to be [s]pread that I had died of my wounds, and indeed never was a man nearer the confines of the grave than I was---but by the care and attention of the people that were about me, I was in [s]ix weeks able to go into the country, where I remained above two months in a languid, weak [s]tate, during which time I received not one line from my Lord---as [s]oon as I found my[s]elf able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I [s]et forward for England, where I arrived about ten months [s]ince, and found my dear Maria in a situation truly deplorable---The old Earl was dead, and his [s]on daily expected from Paris, where he had made a longer [s]tay than he at fir[s]t intended---Maria had been [s]ix months without receiving any money on my account, as my Lord had wrote to his father's [s]leward, informing him that I cho[s]e to be left at Madrid---I endeavoured to get employ; and, after many fruitle[s]s attempts, at la[s]t got a curacy of thirty pounds a year, which is but trifling to [s]upport a wife and two children---I have frequently wrote to my Lord who has been at his [s]eat in E[s][s]ex ever [s]ince his arrival in England; but either has been prevented from an[s]wering my letters by a multiplicity of business, or he does not choo[s]e to be troubled with an indigent friend---Yet I cannot bring my[s]elf to think it po[s][s]ible for a human being to be [s]o ungrateful as to turn a deaf ear to the complaint of a man who once [s]aved his life, at the hazard of his own---He arrived in town three days [s]ince; and this day at two o'clock I propo[s]e waiting on him, and requesting his a[s][s]i[s]tance. We will take an hackney coach, and I will [s]et you down at his door, [s]aid I. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] When we arrived within ten yards of the hou[s]e I [s]topped the coach, and getting out, wi[s]hed my friend a good morning, and turned down a [s]treet only to put on my ring---when quickening my pace, I was at the Earl's door as [s]oon as he was. A [s]ervant appeared, who[s]e in[s]olent carriage bespoke the character of his Lord. You may always judge of a man's general demeanor and di[s]po[s]ition by the behaviour of his [s]ervant, the lower cla[s]s of mankind always aping the manners of their [s]uperiors. After [s]ome he[s]itation, and a few leering, [s]aucy looks at the ru[s]ty garb of my friend, he left him [s]tanding in the hall, and went up to my Lord. Having waited full a quarter of an hour, he again made his appearance at the top of the [s]tairs, and reaching his body partly over the ballu[s]trades, called out, You may come up. I followed him into the chamber of the young Earl---He was [s]itting in an ea[s]y chair, dre[s][s]ed in a long robe de chambre, a di[s]h of chocolate in one hand and the new[s]paper in the other;---his back was partly toward the door;---and on my friend's being announced, he neither turned his head nor rai[s]ed his eyes from the paper--- I have taken the earlie[s]t opportunity to wait on your Lord[s]hip, [s]aid my friend bowing. Oh, Mr. Teachum, [s]aid my Lord, I am glad to [s]ee you---Set Mr. Teachum a chair---[s]aid he to the [s]ervant---and when did you arrive in England, Mr. Teachum? I had the honor of informing your Lord[s]hip by letter, he replied, about [s]ix months [s]ince, and of the mi[s]take that was made concerning my [s]alary, which was [s]topped from the time your Lord[s]hip left Madrid. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] Why, Teachum, [s]aid my Lord, lifting up his eyes for the fir[s]t time from the paper, and looking at my friend with a [s]ort of [s]urpri[s]e, I thought from that time you was free from my [s]ervice. Very true, my Lord; but the wound I received in your Lord[s]hips [s]ervice confined me to my apartment for a long time; and the attendance I received was very expen[s]ive---I had nothing to depend on but your Lord[s]hip's bounty. Well, I will [s]ee and recompen[s]e you for your salary's being [s]topped--- Pray how have you lived [s]ince your return to England? But poorly my Lord; I have but thirty pounds a year. My Lord again looked up; but it was a look of di[s]belief. And how many children have you? Two, my Lord; a boy and a girl. Well, I will [s]ee and do [s]omething for the boy--- and let me think---yes, there's the living at Wiltham, about three hundred a year---that will ju[s]t [s]uit you---call on me again in a day or two; I [s]hall always be glad to [s]ee you. So [s]aying, he got up, and, without farther ceremony, walked into the next room---my friend departed, and I followed my Lord---He pulled the bell--- John, [s]aid he to the [s]ervant that entered, I de[s]ire you will tell the porter never to admit that [s]habby par[s]on again; I don't like to be teazed with vi[s]its from [s]uch mean-looking people. Mr Bauble waits below, [s]aid the [s]ervant. De[s]ire Mr. Bauble to walk up---and when Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange comes, let me know. The jeweller entered, and in a few moments after, Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange; who[s]e levity of carriage, [s]tudied [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] negligence, and confident [s]tare, at once [s]poke her profe[s][s]ion. A number of jewels were di[s]played; and this Lord who had not a guinea to [s]pare for the poor man who [s]aved his life, lavi[s]hed four hundred pounds on jewels for an infamous [s]trumpet. And is [s]uch a man, [s]aid I, as I left the hou[s]e, is [s]uch a man as this a peer of the realm? can he, who ought to ornament the nation, thus [s]hamefully disgrace it!---Of all the crimes man can commit, ingratitude is the blacke[s]t; It argues a depravity of heart, a mind [s]tupid and in[s]en[s]ible; it [s]ets a man below the brute creation---the animal word in general are grateful, affectionate, and faithful---But man--- man, who[s]e boa[s]ted rea[s]on makes him lord over tho[s]e who act merely from in[s]tinct, lo[s]es his superiority by folly and ingratitude---I am certain that the man who is unmindful of a benefit conferred on him by a brother mortal, is totally de[s]titute of gratitude toward the great [s]ource of his life, health and pro[s]perity. I will go and [s]ee Teachum, [s]aid I, one day, after having recounted his [s]tory to my Emma---She would accompany me--- Their habitation was [s]mall, but every thing about it was neat to exce[s]s; there was nothing to be [s]een that [s]poke di[s]tre[s]s; the children were clean; Maria her[s]elf, though her attire was plain, appeared the model of elegance---[s]he was hearing her children their le[s][s]on; they [s]tood before her, reading each alternately a ver[s]e from the [s]acred writings. Teachum was leaning over the back of her chair, gazing at his children, with eyes expre[s][s]ive of as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] much plea[s]ure, and far more [s]erenity, than the mi[s]er who contemplates his hoarded trea[s]ure--- We are come to [s]pend an hour with you, [s]aid I, leading my Emma into the room. Maria was embarra[s][s]ed; but [s]he was too polite to make unnece[s][s]ary excu[s]es concerning her dre[s]s or apartment---I always think [s]uch apologies are a [s]ort of reproof for an untimely vi[s]it. Have you [s]een my Lord lately? [s]aid I. He is never at home, replied Teachum. I am [s]orry for it, [s]aid I; and believe me, my friend, I think your attendance on him is entirely unnece[s][s]ary, and your hopes from that quarter fruitless--- I have taken the liberty of calling, to offer you any [s]ervice that is in my power, and to beg you will look upon me as your friend. I [s]hall hope to [s]ee you often at my hou[s]e. And I hope, [s]aid Emma, that Mrs. Teachum and my little friends here will always accompany you. I have been [s]adly perplexed for the[s]e few days, [s]aid I, changing the conver[s]ation---I have got a manuscript in my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion written in the Ea[s]tern language; I am certain it contains [s]ome extraordinary incidents, but cannot get at the particulars, being almo[s]t entirely unacquainted with the characters it is wrote in. It is lucky, [s]aid Teachum, that you have mentioned it to me; I ever took great plea[s]ure in [s]tudying the Ea[s]tern languages, and am a great admirer of their [s]tile; it is [s]imple and elegant, and though we may tran[s]late it with tolerable correctne[s]s, we can never entirely pre[s]erve its native purity---If you will put the manu[s]cript into my hands I will u[s]e my endeavours to tran[s]late it. I have many lei[s]ure hours, in which I amu[s]e my[s]elf with my pen. I was highly plea[s]ed with the idea of having the adventures of the poor Indian in my native language, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] and de[s]ired Teachum to call on me next day; when fearful of paining them by a longer vi[s]it, we reluctantly took our leave. Emma, at parting, put [s]omething into the hand of the girl; and [s]eeing I ob[s]erved her, [s]he took my hand when we were [s]eated in the carriage---it was but a trifle, my love, [s]aid [s]he; and I had [s]aved it from my own private expences. Had [s]he ju[s]t been giving away half my fortune, the look, the manner in which [s]he pronounced the[s]e words, would have in[s]tantly obtained forgiveness. Emma intended to call on [s]everal of her acquaintance.--- I hate vi[s]its of ceremony---[s]o alighting from the carriage, I [s]trolled into the fields. An itinerant preacher was mounted above a listening multitude, bawling out the virtues and excellencies of charity, and [s]trongly recommending brotherly love among the elect---all his cry was faith and charity; at the [s]ame time he declared every one to be in a [s]tate of perdition that differed from his [s]ect in their opinion concerning religious matters. I never was partial to people of this per[s]ua[s]ion; not that I condemn the whole cla[s]s---no, far be it from me to cen[s]ure a large body of people, becau[s]e [s]ome of the members are hypocrites.---I have known many people who pro[s]e[s]s Methodi[s]m, humane, charitable, and ju[s]t; but they were people of enlarged ideas, and liberal education---the [s]olemn gait---[s]anctified air---upca[s]t eyes---and tongue ever ready with scripture phra[s]es and quotations, are by no means the [s]igns of genuine piety.---A chearful, contented di[s]po[s]ition---a heart grateful for every ble[s][s]ing, and re[s]igned to the all-wi[s]e di[s]pen[s]ations of Providence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] \---and an hand ready to be[s]tow on others part of the ble[s][s]ings we enjoy our[s]elves;---the[s]e are the re[s]ults of pure religion---the[s]e are acceptable [s]acrifices in the [s]ight of our Creator. When the preacher had fini[s]hed his oration, he de[s]cended from the tub on which he had [s]tood; and with his hat in his hand, walked round to his numerous congregation, every one warm with the impression made by his di[s]cour[s]e, readily contributed [s]omething towards the [s]upport of a man who was [s]o eloquent in recommending them to [s]eek the right way to eternal happine[s]s. The collection that was made mu[s]t have amply repaid him for the time and breath he had [s]pent in exhorting them to charity. I [s]hould like to know, [s]aid I, whether this man practi[s]es the virtue him[s]elf, he [s]o [s]trongly recommends to others. I put on my ring and followed him home. His habitation was at Chel[s]ea---at his door he was met by a woman decently dre[s][s]ed, but dejected in her countenance---her eyes were [s]wolen with tears. Well [s]aid the man, pu[s]hing rudely by her, is he gone? He is gone, [s]he replied---gone for ever. What, is he dead? Yes. And in my hou[s]e---why was he not removed to the work hou[s]e? Alas, Sir, replied the woman, the pari[s]h officers came to take him away; and the exertions he made to ri[s]e and dre[s]s him[s]elf being too much for his weak frame, he expired as they were putting him into the chair. And, who will pay for the funeral? The pari[s]h will. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] And, do you think he [s]hall go out of this hou[s]e till I am paid my rent?---No, no, as he has died here, he [s]hall [s]tay till every farthing owing me is discharged.--- Have you got any money now? Not one halfpenny, or a mor[s]el of bread for my poor children---But I will [s]ell my bed---it is the la[s]t thing I have left, and we will henceforth [s]leep on [s]traw. You [s]hall [s]ell nothing---touch nothing till I am paid.---What, do you think I am to lo[s]e a whole year's rent? Have you no compa[s][s]ion on a poor widow and [s]ix fatherle[s]s children? [s]aid the woman. I do not know what bu[s]ine[s]s [s]uch poor folks have to get children, he replied. Go, go along, woman; I am going to dinner, and cannot be troubled with your whining and complaints. I took off my ring; and following the poor woman up [s]tairs, gave her [s]omething to quiet the apprehensions her inhuman landlord's di[s]cour[s]e had inspired. As I pa[s][s]ed from the [s]tairca[s]e to the [s]treet door, I heard this teacher of charity pouring forth a long grace over his meat. Hypocritical wretch! [s]aid I, do[s]t thou think this lip [s]ervice is acceptable to God?---Mi[s]taken man, thou art mocking the Lord of the univer[s]e.---Go, divide your meal with the widow and the fatherle[s]s--- it is the be[s]t way of [s]hewing your gratitude to him who gave it you. Such men as this, [s]aid I, as I left the hou[s]e, are a great deal more prejudicial to [s]ociety than the professed libertine. When we [s]ee a man neglect all religious duties---break through all ties moral and divine, we naturally turn from him with horror and dete[s]tation.---But, when a man under the cloak of piety and virtue, who profe[s][s]es a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] religion, is di[s]covered to be hard-hearted---oppre[s][s]ive--- avaricious---[s]elfi[s]h---in [s]hort, living in the private practice of every vice he publicly declaims again[s]t; is it not enough to make the generality of the world conclude that religion is no more than a [s]pecious ma[s]k put on to deceive mankind? Religion, in her own native [s]implicity, is truly lovely---[s]he attracts admiration---charms the [s]oul by her precepts---and pa[s][s]ing with us through life blunts the points of tho[s]e arrows of affliction which it is the lot of every mortal to experience. But, hypocri[s]y too often puts on her plea[s]ing garb; and, when di[s]covered, leads mankind to think the angel face of piety hides the foul fiend beneath. Mr. Teachum was in my [s]tudy full half an hour before I came down.---Well, my friend, [s]aid I, as I entered, don't you think I have got a fine parcel of writings?---Here in this drawer, pointing to one that was partly open, I keep all my heroic poetry--- here is another for plays---another for odes, sonnets, pa[s]torals, &c.---What a charming prize the[s]e would be to [s]ome garreted author; he might [s]ell all this wa[s]te paper for at lea[s]t two pence a pound---it would then turn to [s]ome account, for it might [s]erve to wrap penny worths of tobacco--- light pipes, fires, &c. or, in [s]hort, be applied to any other u[s]e the po[s][s]e[s][s]or might want wa[s]te paper for. What an humiliating idea! [s]aid my friend, smiling. Not at all, [s]aid I; in following the dictates of imagination, and employing my pen, I plea[s]e, I amuse my[s]elf---but if my writings are not [s]o lucky as to plea[s]e and amu[s]e others, why [s]hould I be mortified?--- every man has a peculiar ta[s]te; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] between you and I, my friend, every man has a peculiar hobby-hor[s]e, on which he frequently mounts, and rides away po[s]t ha[s]te, without once con[s]idering who he may di[s]compo[s]e, overturn, or offend in the wild career. I know one man, who, though po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of a very moderate fortune, and who has had but a confined education, is [s]o fond of aping the in[s]olent carriage of a Lord, that he is continually di[s]tre[s][s]ing his companions by affected grimaces, and [s]tudied ge[s]tures--- then he [s]peaks in [s]uch a pompous [s]tile, and a[s][s]umes [s]uch an air of con[s]equence, that while he thinks he is received with admiration, every man of [s]en[s]e mu[s]t laugh at his folly. Another is fond of di[s]playing his profound learning in the different [s]ciences---at one time he is a professor of mu[s]ic---at another time he [s]tudies logic; and when by chance you mention either of tho[s]e sciences, he will run on at lea[s]t two hours without either taking breath, or giving you an opportunity to edge in a [s]ingle word. The[s]e are their hobby hor[s]es---writing is mine. I would not give up the plea[s]ure of writing for any pecuniary gratification that could be offered. That is, [s]aid my friend, becau[s]e you [s]tand in need of no pecuniary favours; but, a[s]k the poor author, who, in an airy apartment, three [s]tories from the ground, [s]its invoking the coy mu[s]es to a[s][s]i[s]t him in writing [s]omething to gain him a few guineas that might [s]erve to [s]atisfy his butcher, baker, &c.---a[s]k him, my good friend, if he will give up the plea[s]ure of writing, to enjoy a [s]ettled [s]alary of [s]ixty pounds a year. He might readily promi[s]e to do [s]o, [s]aid I; but take my word for it, the very fir[s]t time pen, ink, paper, and opportunity [s]ell in his way, he would write [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] an eulogium on the man who had thus generou[s]ly rai[s]ed him from di[s]tre[s]s. Oh, ye [s]weet tuneful [s]i[s]ters, may ye never for[s]ake my man[s]ion; but when on the wing to vi[s]it your favourites---Burney, Moore, and Inchbald---[s]top for a moment, and dart a [s]ingle ray of your [s]acred fire upon the humble[s]t of your votaries---in a [s]ad hour it will enliven me---in a lonely hour, amu[s]e---and, when happine[s]s deigns to be my companion, it will increa[s]e every plea[s]ure. But come, [s]aid I to Teachum, here is the [s]tory I wi[s]h you to tran[s]late.---I am going out for a few hours, and [s]hall hope to [s]ee it in fair Engli[s]h characters when I come back.---You [s]hall [s]ee part of it at lea[s]t, [s]aid he. So I left him; and mounting my hor[s]e which was at the door, rode into Hyde Park. On my entering the Park, I [s]aw at a di[s]tance, a multiplicity of people, [s]ome running one way, [s]ome another, and all in the utmo[s]t confu[s]ion.---I rode up to the place, and the fir[s]t thing that pre[s]ented it[s]elf to my view, was Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange in a fit; and a few paces from her, a young man laying on the ground, bleeding. By his [s]ide knelt the fair mourner whom I had [s]een in Ken[s]ington Gardens---[s]he was endeavouring to [s]taunch the blood that i[s][s]ued from his [s]ide, with her handkerchief---it [s]eemed a [s]cene of confusion, for no one was paying the lea[s]t attention to the wounded man but this unhappy woman. I called my [s]ervant, and giving him my hor[s]e, rai[s]ed the young man from the ground; and presently perceived it was Lord Ernolf, whom Teachum had attended abroad. I a[s][s]i[s]ted the fair mourner to bind up his wound with our handkerchiefs, and a [s]ervant at that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] moment arriving with a [s]urgeon and a litter, we lifted him on it, and proceeded to the neare[s]t hou[s]e---the [s]urgeon thinking the [s]ooner his wound was dre[s][s]ed the better. The mourner followed pen[s]ively---often cro[s][s]ing her[s]elf, [s]ighing, and weeping bitterly---no one attempted to ob[s]truct her entrance into the hou[s]e with us. The wound was dre[s][s]ed, and the [s]urgeon pronounced it not dangerous, provided a fever could be prevented. Lord Ernolf had fainted through lo[s]s of blood; and during the time of his wound being dre[s][s]ed, remained in a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility. It was judged proper that he [s]hould be immediately put to bed; but, when the [s]ervant attempted to move him, the mourner came to me and entreated that [s]he might not be [s]eparated from him--- for, indeed Sir, [s]aid [s]he, I heartily forgive him---I do not wi[s]h his death now, though once I [s]ought to have a[s][s]a[s][s]inated him; but I have [s]ince been taught that we [s]hould forgive tho[s]e who injured us. Alas! if it were not for the reflection that I am not at enmity with any mortal breathing, how [s]hould I have hope to obtain pardon of my Creator for the heinous crime I have committed whil[s]t in pur[s]uit of my revenge! I thought from the[s]e few words that this haple[s]s mourner could be no other than poor Leonilla.--- I entreated the people of the hou[s]e to let her remain with the wounded nobleman; and attended her up to his chamber, where he was in bed, and ju[s]t recovering his [s]en[s]es. She approached the bed, and [s]itting down on the [s]ide, took one of his hands---ki[s][s]ed it, and pre[s][s]ed it to her bo[s]om. He lifted his languid eyes, and fixed them on her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] face---at fir[s]t they [s]poke amazement and terror---but at la[s]t, grief. Where am I? [s]aid he---am I pa[s][s]ing the bounds of mortality; and art thou, ble[s]t [s]hade, [s]uffered to conduct me through the gloomy vale?---I know why you look [s]o mournful---you died of a broken heart---but, I [s]hall be puni[s]hed for my crimes. Compo[s]e your[s]elf, my Lord, [s]aid the mourner--- you are in no danger, I hope you may yet live many years, and be happy. Do you talk of happine[s]s, [s]aid he; and do you wi[s]h me happy? I do! I do! So Heaven hear my prayers. But, tell me, [s]aid he, how came you here?---am I not in England? She was going to an[s]wer---when I interpo[s]ed and begged they would both be [s]ilent, and con[s]ider of what dangerous con[s]equences a violent exertion of [s]pirits might be to the young gentleman. She promised obedience, drew the curtains round the bed, and [s]at down in an ea[s]y chair that [s]tood at the head. A nur[s]e entering, I took that opportunity to go and inquire what had been the cau[s]e of this unhappy affair. The [s]ervant who attended Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange and his Lord[s]hip in their ride that morning, gave me the following account: That a [s]trange gentleman rode up to Mi[s]s L'Estrange, and acco[s]ting her in a very haughty manner, inquired why [s]he had left him at Paris, and what [s]he had done with a miniature picture which [s]he had taken from his cabinet the morning before the left him; the Lady pretended not to know him, and complained to my Lord that [s]he was in[s]ulted; upon which, high words en[s]ued between the [s]tranger and Lord Ernolf, when the former, having a pair of pi[s]tols ready in his pocket, offered one to my Lord, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] who being naturally of a warm di[s]po[s]ition, took it, and before any interpo[s]ition could be made, they both fired; my Lord's pi[s]tol took no effect, but the [s]tranger's wounded him in the manner you have [s]een. At the di[s]charge of the pi[s]tols Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange fainted; but I believe, it was more for fear of the life of the gentleman than my Lord's. I ran as fa[s]t as I could for a [s]urgeon.--- The [s]ervant was proceeding in his [s]tory when he was called away. Having gained this intelligence, I determined to go immediately to Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange, who was now become an inmate of Lord Ernolf's hou[s]e, and [s]ee in what manner [s]he behaved, and whether the servant's [s]u[s]picions were well founded. I repaired immediately to his Lord[s]hip's hou[s]e--- inquired for the lady, but was denied admittance---a chariot and four was at the door---I feared [s]ome [s]oul play; and thinking there was no time to be lo[s]t, I watched my opportunity, and, putting on my ring, went into the hou[s]e, and up to the Lady's apartment. I found her [s]itting on a [s]opha with a large quantity of jewels, &c. on a table before her; the was bu[s]ied in packing them up, but often turned and addre[s][s]ed [s]ome endearing expre[s][s]ions to an officer who [s]at beside her, entreating him never to for[s]ake her again, and telling him what riches the had heaped together [s]ince [s]he had lived with Lord Ernolf. I examined the features of the pretended officer, and in [s]pite of a large black patch which he had over one eye, and his eye-brows and complexion being [s]tained, I [s]oon di[s]covered it to be the villain Cogdie, who had e[s]caped from the officers of ju[s]tice as they were conveying him from Gretna Green to London. I learned from the conver[s]ation that pa[s][s]ed between Cogdie and Mi[s]s L'E[s]trange, that [s]he was in reality his lawful wife; but, being of a loo[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] disposition, had broken the matrimonial bonds [s]ome years [s]ince, and vi[s]ited mo[s]t of the capitals in Europe with a young nobleman, who[s]e fortune [s]he had ruined, and finding him no longer able to [s]upport her extravagance, [s]he had left Paris with Lord Ernolf, with whom [s]he had lived for this twelve-month pa[s]t. I found, al[s]o, that chance had thrown Cogdie in her way; and that he, [s]eeing her in [s]o pro[s]perous a [s]ituation, and being him[s]elf at a very low ebb of fortune, had per[s]uaded her that his pa[s][s]ion for her was [s]tronger than ever, and endeavoured to prevail with her to rob the Earl, and decamp with him.---But L'E[s]trange was a woman who[s]e avarice was not [s]o ea[s]ily gratified: [s]he, by feigning the mo[s]t pa[s][s]ionate tenderne[s]s for the Earl, had worked upon his temper till [s]he per[s]uaded him to make a will greatly in her favour; and then the in[s]ult, &c. which happened in the Park, was planned and executed by Cogdie. He had marked the pi[s]tols; the one he gave to Lord Ernolf was charged only with powder, but that which he retained him[s]elf was loaded with ball. I was greatly at a lo[s]s how to act, as I feared to leave the hou[s]e to procure proper per[s]ons to [s]ecure Cogdie, left in the mean time he [s]hould e[s]cape. L'E[s]trange told him he ought to prepare for flight; and giving him [s]everal bank notes, [s]ome jewels, and other valuables, [s]tepped into another room and brought out a gown, petticoats, &c. for him to put on.---I was quite undetermined in what manner to prevent his departure, when L'E[s]trange recollected there was [s]ome more money in a bureau in Lord Ernolf's apartment, which was in a di[s]tant part of the hou[s]e; I followed, and [s]eeing her [s]afe in the clo[s]et, in which there was no bell, and only a [s]mall high window, and that [s]ecured with bars; I pulled to the door, locked and bolted it; I then returned in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] ha[s]te to the apartment where Cogdie was, and [s]eeing him totally ab[s]orbed in the plea[s]ure of contemplating his trea[s]ure, fa[s]tened both the doors without being ob[s]erved. Having [s]ucceeded thus far, I left the hou[s]e with precipitation, and procured proper people to apprehend them; I returned within half an hour, and demanded entrance. Though I had been ab[s]ent [s]o [s]hort a time, five minutes longer had been too late; Cogdie and L'E[s]trange had by their cries alarmed the [s]ervant; for each fearing the other intended information again[s]t them[s]elves, were in the utmo[s]t con[s]ternation; and violent were their cries for liberty--- the [s]ervants had bur[s]t open the doors, and Cogdie was on the [s]tairs in order to depart when I entered. I committed them both to the charge of the constable; having fir[s]t ea[s]ed them of the weighty concern of having [s]o much money and jewels to take off. I waited on them to the hou[s]e of a neighbouring ju[s]tice, made my accu[s]ation in proper form, and being certain that apartments in a [s]trong, well-built man[s]ion, would be prepared for their reception till farther inquiry [s]hould be made concerning the affair, I left them, and returned to the wounded Noblemen; and from thence home. I thought you were lo[s]t, my love, [s]aid Emma, as I entered the parlour about eleven o'clock, and found her [s]eated at [s]upper with Teachum and his Maria.---In my hurry and confu[s]ion in the morning, though I had [s]ent my [s]ervant home, I had not [s]ent any me[s][s]age by him: I was therefore not surprised at my Emma's exclamation. The adventures of the day had [s]o entirely taken up my mind, that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] the Ea[s]t Indian had not once intruded; and even when my friend mentioned having almo[s]t completed the tran[s]lation, I felt no [s]ort of curio[s]ity to [s]ee it.--- We will take a walk to-morrow, [s]aid I to Teachum; I have [s]een Lord Ernolf to-day, and if you like, I will take you to vi[s]it him early. We were at the hou[s]e where he was before ten o'clock. As we entered the room without noi[s]e, we [s]aw the fair Leonilla in the highe[s]t act of devotion; his Lord[s]hip was [s]itting in the bed, [s]upported by pillows, his eyes fixed with a mixture of love and veneration on her face, we were unwilling to di[s]turb them, [s]o drew back behind the curtains. When [s]he had finished her morning ori[s]ons---Oh, my dear Lord, [s]aid [s]he, what a relief do you give my almo[s]t bursting heart, by informing me that your governor is not dead. How [s]evere has the reflection always been, that my ra[s]hne[s]s had [s]ent a de[s]erving man out of the world; a man who had honor, courage, affection, [s]ufficient to make him value his own life as nothing when the life of his Lord was in danger. It is that cruel idea, and the remembrance of my dear father and mother, that at times deprives me of my rea[s]on; but I will be thankful to that good Providence that has taken this mighty load off my heart. I hope you have provided for Mr. Teachum, [s]aid [s]he, after a little pau[s]e. It is a [s]hame to own I have not, [s]aid my Lord; but I will endeavour to repair all my errors. Mr. Teachum is come to [s]ee you, my Lord, [s]aid I, [s]tepping forward. Ernolf [s]tretched out his hand, and taking hold of Teachum's, cried, this wound, my good Dr. Teachum, is an excellent thing. Indeed, my Lord, replied Teachum, I do not believe any body but your[s]elf thinks [s]o, all your friends regret it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] I rejoice in it, [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, it makes me feelingly remember my own ingratitude. Teachum walked to the other end of the room--- he was too much of a Chri[s]tian to rejoice in the pain of a fellow mortal, though it might be productive of good to him[s]elf. After our noble patient's wound was again dre[s][s]ed, he reque[s]ted Leonilla to inform him why [s]he had left her native country. She [s]aid, that when [s]he found by the rumour then prevailing at Madrid, that Mr. Teachum was killed in defending his Lord[s]hip, it lay very heavy at her heart, and [s]he grew melancholy and [s]ickly.---I never went to [s]leep, [s]aid [s]he, but I fancied the [s]hade of the innocent man my ra[s]hne[s]s had murdered, was reproaching me. I thought my mind would be easier after confe[s][s]ion, and went to my holy father, confe[s][s]ed my fir[s]t deviation from duty, my grief, anger, revenge, and all its fatal con[s]equences.---The good father rebuked the [s]pirit of revenge that [s]till was harboured in my bo[s]om, and taught me that penitence, fa[s]ting, and tears, were the only methods to gain the pardon of the Creator for my heinous offences--- but alas! Sir, I could not pray---my mind was in a [s]tate of horror, not to be de[s]cribed---remorse, love, and rage, by turns tormented my [s]oul; but Heaven offended at my ob[s]tinacy and folly, visited me with a dreadful judgment.---I had a favourite dog which you had given me; on this poor inoffensive animal did I vent the various changes of my temper, one moment care[s][s]ing it, the next u[s]ing it with the utmo[s]t barbarity. My dear mother had never [s]u[s]pected my di[s]honour; [s]he wondered at the alteration [s]o vi[s]ible in my health and di[s]po[s]ition; and frequently chid me for my unkindne[s]s to this poor little animal. I fear I u[s]ed it very ill; but, indeed I hardly know what I did, my mind was [s]o di[s]ordered. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] My dog ran mad, and bit my dear mother; all medical a[s][s]i[s]tance was tried without effect---[s]he expired in the greate[s]t agony. My father who was on a campaign again[s]t the Turks at the time this happened, unfortunately retured the day before my mother was buried---he was unrepared for the [s]troke he [s]aw my mother's corp[s]e---he [s]aw me deprived of my [s]en[s]es. In my delirium I told him how I had di[s]honored his hou[s]e---It was too much; he was not equal to the mighty load of [s]orrow, but [s]unk under it. Since that, I have wandered about, over barren hills and de[s]ert plains, [s]eeking content, but [s]he fled from me as I pur[s]ued her. I thought [s]he might dwell with charity; [s]o I divided my portion with the fatherle[s]s and the widow; but alas! I could never find her---[s]he is buried in the grave with my dear parents! I [s]aw that the recital of her misfortunes had occasioned a return of her unhappy malady; [s]o taking her by her hand, I led her into another apartment, and per[s]uaded her to take [s]ome repo[s]e. About [s]ix weeks after, I had the plea[s]ure of bestowing her in marriage on the repentant Lord Ernolf. Teachum performed the ceremony; and his Lord gave him as a marriage portion, the promi[s]ed living of Wiltham. Leonilla never after relap[s]ed into her former disordered [s]late of mind. She entreated that Cogdie and his compantons might be forgiven. Her Lord complied with her reque[s]t; and [s]he gave them a [s]um of money, to prevent poverty being an incentive to future vice. But they were too far immerged in all manner of deceit to think of amendment, and [s]oon returned to their old practices. I cannot help here relating a circum[s]tance that happened many years after.---The [s]on which Olivia [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] brought into the world, the fruit of her unfortunate attachment to Cogdie, as he advanced in years, shewed no [s]igns of any of his father's vices in his disposition, except a propen[s]ity to gaming.---This propensity he once indulged at a public gaming hou[s]e, where an old man having won from him a considerable [s]um of money, which the young [s]park imagining was not won by fair play; high words aro[s]e, and a challenge was given. They met, fired, and the old man was wounded.--- The [s]on of Olivia, though ha[s]ty in his temper, was generous, humane, and forgiving; he wi[s]hed not to take the life even of the man who had wronged him. He had him carried to his lodgings; and finding him in a poor [s]ituation, he [s]ent for a [s]urgeon, and [s]upplied him with all the nece[s][s]aries and comforts of life at his own expence. A [s]ervant in the family who ob[s]erved the frequent vi[s]its of Olivia's [s]on to this mean, ob[s]cure lodging, told it as a [s]ecret to Olivia's maid, who directly told it to her mi[s]tre[s]s. Olivia was then at my hou[s]e; [s]he had often wished an union might take place between her [s]on and Lucy Heartfree, my fair petitioner. The idea of a [s]ecret mi[s]tre[s]s immediately alarmed her.---She desired me to go with her to the place the [s]ervant had mentioned. I complied. When we entered the room, the fir[s]t object that [s]truck our [s]ight was her [s]on helping a woman to lift an infirm, [s]ickly old man from a chair to the bed; he was, to all appearance, near his end. The old man no [s]ooner [s]aw us than he breathed a dreadful groan, and fell back in his chair. Olivia was greatly agitated---[s]he applied her [s]alts to his no[s]e.---He recovered---he gazed feebly on her. It [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] is Olivia, [s]aid he.---She [s]tarted.---Do you not know me, Olivia? have you forgot the wretched Cogdie? Gracious Heaven! cried Olivia, catching hold of her [s]on's hand, it is your father. My father! [s]aid the youth; then I am a parricide. Not [s]o, my [s]on, an[s]wered Cogdie; you have only revenged your mother's injuries.---But, will you forgive me. May heaven forgive you as freely, [s]aid Olivia. Her [s]on knelt, and craved forgivene[s]s of his dying father. It is enough [s]aid Cogdie. I forgive, and hope to be forgiven.---His head [s]unk on Olivia's [s]houlder--- he groaned and expired. I think you have never read Mr. Teachum's tran[s]lation, [s]aid Emma, one evening, as I was sitting by her, li[s]tening to the innocent prattle of Harriet and her little companion---I had [s]ome months before committed them to the care of Mrs.---of Hammer[s]mith. Though I had always heard the highe[s]t character of this lady and her [s]chool, yet my dear Harriet, who at this time was at home for the holidays, rai[s]ed it in my opinion---Lucy, [s]aid he, let us play at [s]chool--- you [s]hall be Mrs.---, and I will be a scholar. You may always judge by the play of children what company, regulations, and conver[s]ation, they are u[s]ed to. Come here, Mi[s]s Harriet, [s]aid Lucy; I hope you are very well this morning, and quite prepared to [s]ay your ta[s]k; you know I [s]hall take no excu[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] Come, Ladies, it is eight o'clock, and not all dre[s][s]ed yet!---Oh [s]ye! Mi[s]s, your face and hands are not wa[s]hed!---how indelicate that is!---well, now we are all ready---[s]o you mu[s]t kneel down and [s]ay your prayers. Do you always [s]ay your prayers at [s]chool, Harriet? [s]aid I. Oh, yes, Papa; Mrs. --- not only makes us [s]ay our prayers, but [s]he [s]ays her own prayers with us. Do you love Mrs. ---, my dear? Yes, indeed, Papa---I don't know any body but what does love her, [s]he is [s]o good to us all. I was [s]o plea[s]ed with the account the children gave of this amiable woman, that by means of my ring I frequently vi[s]ited her un[s]een---there was always the [s]ame decent regularity ob[s]erved through the whole hou[s]e. She had a relation lived with her---I would mention [s]ome acts of humanity which I have [s]een this relation perform, but I fear to hurt her delicacy--- Yet there is one which will never be era[s]ed from my mind. It was the kindne[s]s [s]he [s]hewed to a poor young woman who was di[s]tre[s][s]ed, calumniated, and be[s]et with dangers---Yet [s]he knew not the full force of her benevolence; But I, who vi[s]ited, un[s]een, the object of her humanity, know, that [s]he drew her from an horrid precipice, from whence [s]he mu[s]t have [s]oon plunged into the gulf of infamy. Oh! thou gentle pattern of benevolence and piety, judge not the poor young woman from appearances--- could'[s]t thou but [s]ee her heart, thou would'[s]t there read gratitude to thee written in indelible characters--- and when [s]he prays for thee, who[s]e bounty [s]he has received,[s]he humbly a[s]ks of Heaven the power to return it.---But I am always running from the [s]ubject I begin with.

Sadi , the [s]on of Mahadan, the rich po[s][s]e[s][s]or of a [s]ertile valley, watered by a beautiful river---who had [s]laves at his command, and was called by the [s]ons of the Ea[s]t, Sadi the Happy.---Ah! what avails po[s][s]e[s][s]ions and trea[s]ure?---and what is terre[s]trial happiness to man?---It vani[s]heth like a dream---it departeth like the mi[s]t of the morning before the beams of the [s]un. Sadi, the once rich and happy, is a [s]lave and wretched.---Go tell this to the daughters of joy--- [s]ound it in the ears of the [s]ons of plea[s]ure; for prosperity has hardened their hearts, and made them callous to the feelings of humanity. Zelia was the faire[s]t among the daughters of Arabia; [s]he was tall, and [s]traight as the pine tree; [s]tately as the young cedar; her [s]kin was like the ripe olive; her eyes, bright [s]tars; her locks were like the poli[s]hed ebony; and her teeth, fair rows of pearl; her lips were the colour of the ruby; and her breath like the breezes blowing from the [s]picy i[s]lands. I built a bower for my Zelia; I adorned it with beautiful flowers, and planted [s]weet [s]melling [s]hrubs around it. With lofty trees I fenced out the [s]un beams; and the birds dwelt in their branches.---In the rece[s]s was a [s]ilver [s]tream; the o[s]iers and wild flowers hung upon its banks, and the [s]wans [s]ported on its bo[s]om. I [s]ought my love among the daughters of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] plain---I wooed her in the [s]hady places---I brought her to the bower I had planted---I culled for her the choice[s]t fruits---I brought her [s]ilks from the looms of Per[s]ia---I platted her hair with fre[s]h flowers---I put co[s]tly jewels in her ears---and with pearls made bracelets for her arms. We were the happie[s]t among the happy; in the morning we aro[s]e together and wor[s]hipped the bright luminary of day.---We [s]trayed over the fertile valleys---we [s]ported with the young [s]awns; or retired from the heat, and repo[s]ed in the thick [s]hade. If I was in pain, [s]he would [s]ooth me.---I li[s]tened to her angel voice all day; and at night I repo[s]ed on her bo[s]om. The curtain of night had fallen over us---the [s]tars [s]hot their beams through the Heavens---the voice of di[s]tre[s]s met our ears---the plaints of [s]orrow invaded our dwelling---we went forth from the bower---we [s]aw a Chri[s]tian overpowered by his adver[s]ary. The blood i[s][s]ued from his bo[s]om---his face was the picture of terror. We bore him to our peaceful bower---we poure I oil upon his wounds, and Zelia bound them up with her hands.---She watched him with the care of a [s]i[s]ter---[s]he gave him a part of our fruits, and brought him milk from the young camels.---He was grateful for the kindne[s]s we [s]hewed---he [s]wore by his God it [s]hould not be forgotten.---But, the word of a man is like unto the wind; it maketh a [s]ound, passeth, and is no more remembered. He left our bower once at early dawn---he tarried till the clo[s]e of evening. Zelia had retired to re[s]t---the moon beams played upon her face---I contemplated her [s]leeping beauties. The Chri[s]tian I had [s]aved, entered the bower--- be brought with him a band of ruthle[s]s ru[s][s]ians.--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] He [s]eized upon my lovely Zelia---he li[s]tened not unto her cries---he put a chain upon her feet, and bound the hands which had healed his wounds. They took our co[s]tly ornaments and pearls---they bound me with an heavy iron chain, and led us like two [s]laves towards the [s]ea.---They put us on board a [s]hip he had prepared---they [s]pread the [s]ails---the wind blew from the [s]hore, and in the morn we [s]aw the main before us. They took the chains from off my hands and feet--- they gave me food, but parted me from Zelia. I heard her lift up a voice of terror---I heard her call on Sadi for a[s][s]i[s]tance---I ru[s]hed into the room where they confined her---I [s]aw her in the embraces of a villain---I [s]natched a poniard from his [s]ide---I bade him in[s]tantly forego his prey. Zelia like lightning darted from his arms---[s]he cried, Now, Sadi!---Sadi, follow me!---then, from the window [s]prang into the ocean. I [s]ent the poniard to the traitor's heart.---I felt its warm blood gu[s]h upon my hand; then ha[s]tily obeyed my charming Zelia.---I called her as I plunged into the [s]ea---I [s]ought my Zelia in the world of waters; but the [s]pirits of ble[s][s]ed [s]aints had [s]een her virtue---they caught the lovely victim as [s]he fell, and bore her on their wings to paradi[s]e.---I called for death to take a wretched life---I [s]ought the friend of mi[s]ery, but he fled from me. Some other Chri[s]tians [s]aved me from the [s]ea; they gave me food, and treated me with kindne[s]s--- but the kindne[s]s of a Chri[s]tian is like the [s]ong of the Syren, it [s]ooths the [s]en[s]es, gains upon the heart; then, un[s]u[s]pected leads to de[s]truction.---They took me with them to the We[s]tern world---they fold the wretched Sadi for a [s]lave. My haughty [s]pirit was not u[s]ed to bondage.---I heard that England was the land of freedom---I hid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] my[s]elf on board an Engli[s]h [s]hip, and [s]ailed un[s]een into the boundle[s]s main.---I left my hiding place, and [s]ought the captain, and bowed my face toward the deck, before him. He told me, I no more [s]hould be a [s]lave---he brought me with him to this land of freedom. But, here I found I al[s]o was deceived; for, here mankind are [s]laves to vice, to avarice, to luxury, and to folly.---The man who brought me from the Western world, demanded payment for my pa[s][s]age over. Alas! I had been rifled by the Chri[s]tians.---I had nought to give but grateful thanks and prayers.--- He who had [s]aid I [s]hould not be a [s]lave, confined me in a loath[s]ome pri[s]on hou[s]e---this was my welcome to the land of freedom. For [s]even long years I never felt the air, nor ever [s]aw the chearful face of Heaven---but the angel of death that vi[s]its all the earth, then [s]topped the breath of my hard per[s]ecutor. I then was freed from out the loath[s]ome pri[s]on, and for a moment I rejoiced in liberty; but [s]oon I felt the gnawing pangs of hunger. I had no friend who[s]e pity might relieve me--- the [s]pacious city was to me a de[s]ert, and I was [s]larving in the land of plenty.---But, who can bear the griping hand of famine; who can [s]ink under it and not complain? I laid me down upon the damp, cold ground---I groaned aloud, and tore my hair through angui[s]h; but many pa[s][s]ed by, nor once regarded me; and others [s]coffed and called me an impostor. I thought the end of all my woes was come--- I cea[s]ed to groan, and waited death's approach; but pity had not wholly fled the world; [s]he dwells within the hearts of Chri[s]tian women---one brought me [s]omething to allay my hunger; another put [s]ome money in my hand.---One [s]eeming almo[s]t as wretched as my[s]elf, looked at me, [s]hook her head, and dropt [s]ome tears. I felt her kindne[s]s more than [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] tho[s]e before---the tear of pity healed my bleeding heart. But, the woes of Sadi [s]oon will have an end; [s]oon [s]hall I [s]leep, and be at re[s]t for ever, for the [s]orrows of my heart overpower me, and pain and [s]ickne[s]s bow me to the earth.---The lamp of life is very near exhau[s]ted; and when each night I lay me down to re[s]t, I think not to behold another morning. And what, alas! has wretched Sadi done? and, who reduced him to this [s]tate of mi[s]ery? Go tell the tale to all the Ea[s]tern world---Go warn them to beware of tru[s]ting Chri[s]tians; for Sadi [s]aved one from the jaws of death, and thus was his humanity rewarded. This is a [s]trange world, [s]aid I, laying down the manu[s]cript, and addre[s][s]ing my dear Emma--- The world, my love, [s]he replied, laying one hand on my [s]houlder, and with the other wiping away a drop which poor Sadi's [s]tory had excited---the world, my love, in it[s]elf is a charming place---it is the people in it that makes it uncomfortable. Let us view it at fir[s]t coming from the hands of the Creator; what beauty, what regularity and order! but no [s]ooner was man created, than pride---avarice--- envy---revenge---and a long train of evils--- Not forgetting female vanity and curio[s]ity, [s]aid I, looking archly at her.--- Nay, my dear, [s]aid [s]he, don't attribute all your evils to our [s]ex; for I am certain, that had not Adam had a little curio[s]ity in his own compo[s]ition, he never could have been prevailed on to [s]tray from his duty---but we are running from the [s]ubject, continued [s]he.

What a delightful place it would be, [s]aid I, if harmony, peace, and love univer[s]ally reigned around us; if there was no ingratitude, no revenge, no rapine, murder, theft, or perjury. It would, [s]aid [s]he; but it is not for us to [s]ay why are things thus? let us, my love, endeavour to perform our duty, and, as far as example will go, lead others to do the [s]ame; and let us be thankful that the world is not [s]o full of allurements as to prevent our preparing and hoping for a better; for my own part, continued [s]he, pa[s][s]ing her arm round my neck, while her lovely countenance beamed with gratitude and love, my cup overflows with ble[s][s]ings; I feel no [s]orrow except it is when I reflect on the vices or sorrows of my fellow creatures; yet, I mu[s]t not expect to pa[s]s this life exempt from woe.---Poor Sadi has had a life of mi[s]ery, it is true, but [s]hall we arraign the power omnipotent, and [s]ay, why was it [s]o? My dear, Emma, [s]aid I, I did not mean to complain of the di[s]pen[s]ations of Providence when I [s]aid it is a [s]trange world; but does it not appear wonderful that a man can [s]o far forget a benefit as to treat his benefactor with cruelty? It is unaccountable, [s]aid [s]he; and yet we hear of it in more in[s]tances than one---what a [s]triking proof of ingratitude is related in Addi[s]on's pathetic [s]tory of Incle and Yarico--- Oh, a propos, [s]aid I, you never gave me your opinion of the opera taken from that [s]tory--- I was greatly plea[s]ed with it, [s]he replied; I think the author [s]hews great judgment in the management of his plot; for after having excited in our imagination a proper horror for the avarice and ingratitude of Incle, by contra[s]ting it with the blunt [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] hone[s]ty of Trudge, he makes his hero repent, and, by unexpectedly bringing him to act with honor and humanity towards his kind pre[s]erver, leaves no impression on the mind of the audience but an entire love and admiration of virtue. I think the remark extremely ju[s]t, [s]aid I, which Incle makes in the conclu[s]ion of the piece---that, his contracted ideas, and gra[s]ping di[s]po[s]ition, was chiefly owing to his education.--- There is nothing, replied my Emma, which, in my opinion, [s]hould be [s]o carefully inculcated in the mind of a child as humanity---there are many parents who, out of a mi[s]taken fondne[s]s for their children, will [s]uffer them, by way of amu[s]ement, to rob birds ne[s]ts, catch butterflies, &c. and transfix them with pins, and a thou[s]and other whims and fancies which are the height of cruelty; the[s]e things by degrees harden their hearts, and they can afterwards practi[s]e cruelty on their fellow creatures without repugnance.--- I would always teach my children to be tender even to the [s]malle[s]t in[s]ect that has life; if, indeed, they are obnoxious or poi[s]onous, and selfpreservation leads us to de[s]troy them, let them be di[s]patched quick and with as little pain as po[s][s]ible.--- Then opening a volume of our immitable Shakespeare, [s]he read the following pa[s][s]age in Mea[s]ure for Mea[s]ure: The poor blind beetle which we tread upon, In corporeal [s]uff'rance feels as much As when a giant falls. Hail, humanity! fair daughter of Heaven, it is thou, bright angel, that can [s]mooth the bed of pain, and blunt the [s]harpe[s]t arrow of di[s]tre[s]s: come, thou cele[s]tial gue[s]t! and dwell with me, and with thee bring thy [s]weet companion gratitude.

I hope you will not di[s]appoint me, Madam, [s]aid a young woman to an old fat dame, who kept a Regi[s]ter Office for hiring of [s]ervants---I had entered the hou[s]e by means of my ring. The young woman was [s]omething below the middle [s]ize, her countenance was dejected, and [s]he appeared not to be u[s]ed to [s]ervitude. You had better [s]it down and re[s]t your[s]elf, my dear, [s]aid the old woman. I will, if you plea[s]e, replied the other; for it is a long walk from Lambeth. She entered a little parlour, and [s]at down; when I learnt from their conver[s]ation that the young woman, whom I [s]hall henceforth call Mariana, was applying for a place as governe[s]s to one or two young ladies, and was promi[s]ed by the woman who kept the office that [s]he [s]hould be recommended to Lady Allworth, who wanted a governe[s]s for her two daughters. It is now [s]ix weeks, [s]aid Mariana, [s]ince I was fir[s]t propo[s]ed to Lady Allworth, and I [s]hould be glad to know whether [s]he will have me or no, for my circumstances are [s]uch as render it ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary that I [s]hould have [s]ome place in a [s]hort time---To-morrow, Mrs. L---y, I hope you will go with me. The old woman promi[s]ed faithfully to attend her, and at ten o'clock the next morning was appointed for her to call. Then to-morrow I will [s]ee thee again, poor, gentle Mariana, [s]aid I. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] I was by no means plea[s]ed with the woman who kept the office; for while Mariana was re[s]ting herself, two young men of fa[s]hion came into the room. I blu[s]h to think, that their being young men of fa[s]hion rendered me unea[s]y on the poor girl's account. There were [s]ome very intelligent looks pa[s][s]ed between them and the old woman; and immediately on their leaving the room Mariana was invited to dine the en[s]uing day. At ten, the next day, Mariana again repaired to the office, and was again di[s]appointed of waiting on Lady Allworth. I know not what to do, [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he left the hou[s]e; and a tear [s]tole down her cheek---She had refu[s]ed the invitation to dinner, and was proceeding with melancholy [s]teps towards her home---I followed her. When [s]he entered the hou[s]e [s]he was wet, cold, and hungry; but there was neither fire nor refreshment. She [s]at down at the end of a long table, and leaning her head upon her hands, the tears flowed plenteously down her pale face---[s]he looked the picture of dumb de[s]pair. I was thinking of [s]ome method to relieve her, when a [s]hort, fat old gentleman entered the room. I read in your face, Mariana, [s]aid he, that you have had no [s]ucce[s]s to-day.--- She [s]hook her head, and a[s]ked his advice how to proceed. I would advi[s]e you to go to Lady Allworth yourself--- write a letter, [s]end it up, and wait for an answer from her lady[s]hip. Mariana wiped her eyes, wrote a letter, and then proceeded to mea[s]ure back the weary [s]teps [s]he had trod before. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] Poor girl! [s]aid I, as I followed her, I [s]hould like to know how you were reduced to this [s]ituation; but I will not leave you till I [s]ee you are likely to get [s]ome [s]ettlement---Youth and innocence without friends or money, in [s]uch a place as London, mu[s]t have a hard [s]truggle to keep free from vice; and will find it impo[s][s]ible to keep free from cen[s]ure. I wi[s]h Lady Allworth may be as much prepossessed in your favour as I am---but perhaps [s]he will not [s]ee you; and [s]hould [s]he not, you [s]hall not be lo[s]t for want of a friend. I do verily believe, that during our walk from Lambeth to St. James's Street, I was almo[s]t as much agitated as Mariana her[s]elf. She tapped mode[s]tly at the door; but I could [s]ee it was humiliating to her. A [s]ervant appeared, and [s]he was in[s]tantly admitted--- Will you deliver this to Lady Allworth? [s]aid [s]he, pre[s]enting the letter. The [s]ervant looked at her with compa[s][s]ion---I thus tran[s]lated his looks: this poor girl is come to entreat a favour of my Lady; I will not be the means of her not obtaining it; I wi[s]h [s]he may meet with [s]ucce[s]s. Sir James Allworth, [s]aid I, is a benevolent man: he never [s]uffers a petitioner to be treated with rudeness or di[s]re[s]pect: I can read his humanity in the countenance of his dome[s]tic. I had hardly time for the reflection before Mariand was de[s]ired to walk up [s]tairs---I perceived that [s]he trembled as [s]he a[s]cended; but had her fears been ever [s]o great, they mu[s]t all have vani[s]hed at the [s]ight of Lady Allworth. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] She was an elegant woman, though arrived to an age when the bloom and [s]prightline[s]s of youth is pa[s]t; yet her face had a benignity about it that diffused it[s]elf over all her features, and [s]eemed enlivened by a ray of cele[s]tial light; her fine black eyes were of that [s]ort that would pierce the inmo[s]t recesses of a guilty [s]oul, but withal, tempered with [s]o much benevolence, that to the innocent they [s]eemed to beam only with humanity and compa[s][s]ion.---Her form was maje[s]tic, and in her manner was a mixture of dignity, ea[s]e, and [s]weetne[s]s. Mariana's countenance brightened up when [s]he [s]aw this lovely woman---[s]he curti[s]ed, and a feint blu[s]h tinged her cheeks--- You are the per[s]on who wrote this letter? a[s]ked her Lady[s]hip. Yes, Madam. Pray, who was it that pretended to recommend you to me? Mariana informed her. Good God! cried Lady Allworth; I know nothing of the woman; I never applied to her for a [s]ervant in my life; and [s]hould never have thought of applying to an office for a governe[s]s. Mariana turned pale, and with difficulty re[s]trained her tears. But pray, continued her Lady[s]hip, pray, Ma'am, inform me how you came to apply to an office:--- have you no friends? But one, Madam, and [s]he is not in a line to recommend me. Poor girl! [s]aid Lady Allworth, [s]oftly---[s]he thought the exclamation of pity too humiliating to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] be addre[s][s]ed to Mariana her[s]elf: it was an involuntary motion of the lips dictated by a feeling heart. Pray, [s]it down, Ma'am continued her Lady[s]hip, and, if it is not di[s]agreeable, inform me how you came into [s]uch a place as London without friends: I feel my[s]elf intere[s]ted in your behalf, and if it is in my power I will [s]erve you. Mariana [s]at down, and with a voice of timidity, accompanied with a look of gratitude, in a few words, acquainted Lady Allworth with her [s]tory. My father, Madam, is an officer in the army; my mother dying while I was yet an in[s]ant, my father married a lady in America, who brought him an ample fortune---he took me over to America when only eight years old, and we remained there in the utmo[s]t harmony till the unhappy breach between Great Britain and her Colonies. My father refusing to join the Americans, his property was confiscated, and he returned with his family to England in a di[s]tre[s][s]ed [s]ituation.---We have been in England [s]even years; the family has been [s]ickly and expen[s]ive---my poor father was involved in debt--- I could not bear the idea of adding to his expences I left my home, which is in the country, and came to town to a di[s]tant relation, in hopes, by indu[s]try, to obtain a living; this relation I have unde[s]ignedly offended; as al[s]o [s]ome who were nearer allied--- my efforts to live by indu[s]try have failed, and I find my[s]elf under the nece[s][s]ity of [s]eeking a [s]ervice---I had flattered my[s]elf with the hopes of being engaged in your Lady[s]hip's family; but alas! I am disappointed in all my undertakings. Has the woman who pretended to recommend, got any money from you? [s]aid her Lady[s]hip. Indeed, Madam, [s]he has got all I had. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] Lady Allworth drew forth her pur[s]e---Mariana aro[s]e to take her leave. Stop a moment, [s]aid Lady Allworth---[s]it down again---you mu[s]t want [s]ome refre[s]hment. A gla[s]s of wine and a bi[s]cuit was ordered. Call on me again in a day or two, [s]aid her Ladyship; I will try to do [s]omething for you; in the mean time accept of this trifle. I could not [s]ee what [s]he put into her hand; but I am [s]ure it was the manner of the giver, not the gift it[s]elf, that [s]unk [s]o deep into Mariana's heart: it was that which made her exclaim as [s]he left the hou[s]e--- Dear Lady, when I forget my obligations to thee, may I cea[s]e to live. Lady Allworth kept her word, and recommended Mariana to a Lady in who[s]e family [s]he remained till ill health obliged her to quit it. Ye fair daughters of Britain, who[s]e charms are the theme of every tongue, the admiration of every eye, and who[s]e prai[s]e is [s]ounded to the mo[s]t di[s]tant kingdoms, learn from the amiable behaviour of a Lady Allworth, how to attain tho[s]e charms which neither time nor accident can dimini[s]h---the beauties of that Lady's per[s]on might have rendered her univer[s]ally admired; but it is the goodne[s]s of her heart alone that could create univer[s]al love and veneration. As I pa[s][s]ed a hou[s]e in the clo[s]e of the evening, the window [s]hutters being open, I [s]aw a woman sitting by a table, her cheek re[s]ting upon her left hand, and a pen in her right---[s]he wrote---then pau[s]ed--- then wrote again: it [s]eemed to be a [s]ubject that required reflection. A genteel young woman [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] knocked at the door---I had time on my hands, [s]o being rather curious to be pre[s]ent at a female tete-a-tete, I put on my ring, and when the door was opened I entered with the vi[s]itor. She was hardly [s]eated, before, ob[s]erving the writing apparatus, [s]he [s]ays, So my dear Ellen, you are exerci[s]ing your fertile genius---you are certainly a charming girl!---what would I not give to po[s][s]e[s]s [s]uch a talent---pray, may I [s]ee your performance, or will you be [s]o obliging as to read it to me? Ellen took up the paper, threw it on the window, and [s]aid, it was only a [s]onnet not worth looking at--- Oh, you [s]ad girl? how can you mortify me [s]o? I am [s]ure if the [s]onnet is the production of your own genius it mu[s]t be delightful---pray do let me [s]ee it. If it will give you any plea[s]ure, [s]aid Ellen, I will read it to you;---but, I a[s][s]ure you, it is but a trifle--- [s]he took it up and read--- From the day of my birth until now, I've [s]till been accu[s]tom'd to grief; My mother [s]he nurs'd me in woe, Her [s]orrows admit no relief; She lull'd me to [s]leep with her [s]ighs, Tears mix'd with the milk of her brea[s]t; For oft would they [s]tart in her eyes, At the [s]ight of an object di[s]tre[s]s'd. To feel for another man's woes, Is a ble[s][s]ing to Briti[s]h hearts giv'n; A ble[s][s]ing which pity be[s]tows; And pity's the daughter of heav'n. All nature rejoic'd at her birth; Humanity fo[s]ter'd the child; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] And when [s]he appear'd upon earth, Each virtue approvingly [s]mil'd. Oh, 'tis divine! exclaimed the vi[s]itor, who[s]e name I found was Greenham;---pray, my dear Ellen, favour me with a copy of it. Ellen promi[s]ed to comply with her reque[s]t. I wonder, [s]aid Mrs. Greenham, why you don't publi[s]h your works; it is a thou[s]and pities [s]uch charming poems as you in general write [s]hould be buried in oblivion. I [s]ometimes, [s]aid Ellen, think I will lay [s]ome of my little productions before the impartial public; but I am quite terrified at the idea of expo[s]ing myself to the ridicule of my own [s]ex or the [s]atire of the other.--- You are too humble, my [s]weet friend, cries Mrs. Greenham, there is not the lea[s]t occa[s]ion for your fears---I am certain your works would be universally read and admired; and it will be inju[s]tice both to your[s]elf and the world, to deprive them of the gratification of peru[s]ing them, and your[s]elf of the [s]ame you would certainly acquire and undoubtedly deserve. It is rather [s]urpri[s]ing, thought I, that one woman [s]hould be [s]o liberal in the prai[s]es of another.---I looked intently in Mrs. Greenham's face; and methought I read di[s][s]imulation in every feature---I took an attentive view of Ellen, and plainly di[s]covered that [s]he [s]aw through the thin veil of her vi[s]itor's flattery; and though [s]he could not but li[s]ten to her with [s]ilent civility, [s]he, in her heart, de[s]pi[s]ed her envy and ill nature much le[s]s than the [s]pecious arts with which [s]he endeavoured to cover them. When Mrs. Greenham took her leave, I followed her; determined to hear in what manner [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] [s]poke of Ellen when ab[s]ent from her. She went immediately home and entertained her hu[s]band and [s]everal vi[s]itors at the expence of the inoffen[s]ive Ellen. I found her, [s]aid [s]he, [s]cribbling as u[s]ual: I prai[s]ed her extravagantly, and advi[s]ed her to publi[s]h her works---[s]he [s]aid [s]he had [s]ome thoughts of it. I wi[s]h [s]he would to my heart, for I [s]hould like to [s]ee her heartily laughed at---I am [s]ure women have no bu[s]ine[s]s with pens in their hands, they had better mend their cloaths, and look after their family. And pray, why not Madam, [s]aid an old gentleman who had li[s]tened attentively to this loquacious harangue, why may not a woman if [s]he has lei[s]ure and genius, take up her pen to gratify both her[s]elf and friends. I am not a[s]hamed to acknowledge that I have peru[s]ed the productions of [s]ome of our female pens, with the highe[s]t [s]atisfaction; and am happy when I find any woman has [s]o large a fund of amu[s]ement in her own mind. I never heard a woman who was fond of her pen complain of the tediou[s]ne[s]s of time; nor, did I ever know [s]uch a woman extravagantly fond of dre[s]s, public amusements, or expen[s]ive gaiety; yet, I have [s]een many women of genius prove them[s]elves excellent mothers, wives, and daughters. But, Sir, replied Mrs. Greenham, the Lady in que[s]tion only fancies her[s]elf po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of genius; her writings are the mo[s]t in[s]ipid things in nature. If I could [s]ee [s]ome of them, [s]aid the old gentleman, I [s]hould be a better judge. Then you [s]hall pre[s]ently, for I expect [s]he will come and [s]pend an hour or two with me this evening, when I can ea[s]ily prevail with her to [s]hew you [s]ome of her pretty [s]crawls. Ellen [s]oon after made her appearance.---Mrs. Greenham received her with a va[s]t [s]how of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] affection, and [s]oon began a conver[s]ation which led to literary productions. I know of nobody [s]o clever in this way, [s]aid [s]he, as my little friend Ellen here---do, my dear, oblige the company by reciting [s]ome of your poems; or, perhaps, you may have [s]ome in your pocket---I know you always have a trea[s]ure there. Indeed Madam, [s]aid Ellen, I only write for amusement; nor can it be [s]uppo[s]ed my performances have any merit worthy the attention of this company. Oh, you are always [s]o diffident--- It is a [s]ure [s]ign of merit, [s]aid the old gentleman.--- But, pray Madam, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf to Ellen, do you devote much of your time to your pen? I am [s]o [s]ituated, Sir, [s]he replied, that I am unavoidably obliged to pa[s]s many hours entirely by myself--- In the former part of my life I have been engaged in many [s]cenes, the remembrance of which, in the[s]e [s]olitary hours, would be extremely painful, were it not for the relaxation and amu[s]ement I find in the exerci[s]e of my pen ---I have but few acquaintance, [s]he continued, and even tho[s]e few might, by too frequent vi[s]its, grow tired of my company. I [s]eldom go out but I meet with [s]ome object to engage my attention; and often when reflecting on the various [s]cenes around me, I fall into a train of ideas which I feel a [s]ort of plea[s]ure in committing to paper; and in general they [s]erve to occupy the next lei[s]ure or [s]olitary hour. And an excellent way of [s]pending time too, replied the old gentleman.---I am certain, Madam, you are never le[s]s alone than when by your[s]elf. It is true, Sir, [s]aid [s]he, I do find a great deal of entertainment from this method of employing myself; but it is no rea[s]on for me to [s]uppo[s]e, becau[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] I am amu[s]ed in writing, another per[s]on [s]hould be amu[s]ed in reading what I have written. But, I do a[s][s]ure you, [s]aid Mrs. Greenham, it will give us all a great deal of [s]atisfaction to hear a little of your performance.---Now do, Ellen, oblige us. Ellen was of a temper that could not bear entreaties--- [s]he had not power to refu[s]e a reque[s]t made with any tolerable degree of [s]incerity and earnestness. I am always in pain for people of this disposition; they often do things ab[s]olutely di[s]agreeable to them[s]elves, becau[s]e they have not [s]trength of mind to refu[s]e peremptorily, but do it [s]o faintly, and with [s]uch evident marks of pain, that a [s]econd or third reque[s]t always conquers. I know a young man of this di[s]po[s]ition who is intoxicated two or three times a week, though he is not naturally addicted to inebriety, and in general [s]uffers exceedingly after it, merely becau[s]e he cannot re[s]i[s]t the earne[s]t importunities of his friends. I know a woman too, who, whenever [s]he goes into a [s]hop, lays out twice as much money as [s]he intended, becau[s]e the [s]hop-keeper intreats her to have this, and that is [s]o va[s]tly pretty, or amazingly cheap---and [s]he imperceptibly launches into extravagancies which [s]he afterwards heartily repents.--- Now, though [s]uch a pliability of temper may be extremely plea[s]ing and agreeable in dome[s]tic life, it expo[s]es a per[s]on to a thou[s]and inconveniencies, improprieties, and irregularities. I would have a man or woman maintain an opinion of their own; and when re[s]olved to refu[s]e a reque[s]t which they may judge imprudent or improper to grant, refu[s]e it with [s]uch [s]teadine[s]s and dignity as may at once prevent their being teized into an action which their rea[s]on revolts again[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] But, this is by way of digre[s][s]ion, [s]o I beg pardon, and return. Ellen, urged by the united reque[s]ts of the company, and a little female vanity which dwelt in her own bo[s]om, at length complied, and recited in a graceful manner, a [s]hort, pathetic tale, written in the elegiac [s]tile, and greatly in the manner of Shenstone. The old gentleman be[s]towed no prai[s]es on it, but he honored the recital with a tear, and [s]oon after left the company---when the inoffen[s]ive Ellen became a butt for the [s]atire, ridicule, envy, and ill-nature of tho[s]e that remained, and who[s]e tongues had only been re[s]trained by his pre[s]ence. Yet Mrs. Greenham profe[s][s]ed an unbounded friend[s]hip for her, and declared there was nothing but what [s]he would freely do to [s]erve her---but [s]he was a fashionable friend. Friend[s]hip is a word univer[s]ally u[s]ed, but little under[s]tood; there are a number of people who [s]tile them[s]elves friends, who never knew what it was to have an anxious thought for the per[s]on for whom they pretend this violent friend[s]hip, in the female world in particular. I make no doubt but there are numbers of women who, [s]hould they be informed whil[s]t at cards, of the greate[s]t misfortune having befallen one of their mo[s]t intimate friends, would cry, Poor thing, I am va[s]tly [s]orry---I had a great regard for her---and then inquire what is trumps? or how gows the game? I can divide the world into five di[s]tinct cla[s][s]es of friends, for there is hardly any one per[s]on breathing but boa[s]ts of feeling that exalted attachment for [s]ome one or other of their fellow mortals.---Among the men, is the professing friend and in[s]idious friend; among the women, the o[s]tentatious, and the envious friend; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] a [s]mall parcel may be culled of both [s]exes and [s]et under the denomination of real friends. I will try him, however, [s]aid Lavinia, wiping her eyes, for I have often heard him [s]ay he valued my dear Ferdinand above all other men---and [s]ure he will not let him langui[s]h in a pri[s]on for the want of [s]uch a trifle, and which we can [s]o [s]oon repay. It was a day or two after I was in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my ring.---I had [s]tepped into a [s]hop to buy a pair of gloves, when a young woman behind the counter addre[s][s]ed the[s]e words to her companion: You may try him, Lavinia, [s]aid her companion, but I do not think you will [s]ucceed; be[s]ide, my dear, your circum[s]tances are not [s]o bad as to lead you to fear your hu[s]band's confinement. They are wor[s]e than you imagine, Eliza, [s]aid [s]he; we have, be[s]ides this bill, [s]everal more to pay, which we are equally unable to provide for.---Mr. Woudbe has profe[s][s]ed the warme[s]t friend[s]hip for my hu[s]band, and I think he will be glad of the opportunity to convince him it was not merely professional. I had by this time purcha[s]ed my gloves; and being anxious to know how Lavinia would [s]ucceed in her undertaking, I ju[s]t left the [s]hop, put on my ring, and returned. Lavinia had left the [s]hop, and was in the parlour. A per[s]on came in, who from his appearance I [s]hould have [s]uppo[s]ed a man of fa[s]hion; yet, I knew him to be a mechanic---his affected air and gait [s]poke him a fini[s]hed coxcomb---it was the identical Mr. Woudbe; he a[s]ked for her hu[s]band; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] he was not at home---he [s]at down, fell into conversation, frequently intimated his [s]ervent wi[s]hes for their pro[s]perity, and declared he de[s]ired nothing more than an opportunity to convince his worthy friend Ferdinand how much he had his intere[s]t and happine[s]s at heart. Lavinia's eyes beamed plea[s]ure and gratitude; [s]he thought it a favourable, golden opportunity---[s]he told him her hu[s]band's circum[s]tances were embarrassed, but the loan of eighty or an hundred pounds would [s]et them quite at ea[s]e; and they [s]hould by industry and oeconomy [s]oon be enabled to repay it. She pleaded with the mo[s]t per[s]ua[s]ive eloquence; love animated her countenance; an anxious tear glittered in her eye---but the profe[s][s]ing Mr. Woudbe had none of the finer feelings which dignify the man; he loved o[s]tentation, [s]how, and grandeur; but he had no idea of any plea[s]ure in life [s]uperior to that he felt when dre[s][s]ed in a finer coat than his neighbour.---Two guineas was not too much for a ticket for a ball, but a [s]hilling was extravagantly thrown away in relieving the wants of a di[s]tre[s][s]ed fellow-creature. To [s]uch a man, the tearful eye, the anxious countenance alternately red and pale, the trembling frame, and [s]truggling [s]igh of Lavinia, pleaded in vain; he heard her with indifference; he con[s]oled her in language in which was an equal mixture of pity and contempt; and I was informed by a person who knew him, that it was the la[s]t vi[s]it he ever paid his friend Ferdinand. This is a [s]ort of friend which the world [s]warms with---profe[s][s]ions co[s]t nothing---give me the man who[s]e heart, alive to every dictate of humanity, [s]tays not till he is a[s]ked to do a favour, but eagerly [s]eeks out opportunities to render [s]ervice to mankind.

I was ca[s]ting in my own mind fifty different plans to find out the real cau[s]e of her distress, and, if po[s][s]ible, relieve it without hurting her feelings, by letting her know that her nece[s][s]ities were di[s]covered by a [s]tranger, when a little man entered the hou[s]e, who[s]e features, however plain, and, to the generality of the world, unintere[s]ting, immediately prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed me in his favour. Lavinia, [s]aid he, I hear you are moving, and am come to [s]ee if I can be of any [s]ervice to you--- where is your hu[s]band? A gu[s]h of tears was all [s]he could an[s]wer. Dear girl, do not weep, [s]aid he---is it pecuniary matters that di[s]tre[s]s you? [s]peak Lavinia; will twenty or thirty guineas be of any [s]ervice to you? She he[s]itated; but at la[s]t confe[s][s]ed that they were greatly di[s]tre[s][s]ed for money; and that her hu[s]band was obliged to keep out of the way of his creditors. I will be with you again in a few moments, [s]aid he, darting out of the hou[s]e. I waited his return. In le[s]s than half an hour he came back, and put a [s]um of money into Lavinia's hand, which entirely calmed her fears. Oh! Sir, [s]aid [s]he, how [s]hall I ever return this obligation. By never mentioning it, he replied: let me beg it may be buried in oblivion---I [s]hall be offended if ever I hear it talked of---it gives me plea[s]ure that I had it in my power to [s]erve [s]o worthy a man as your hu[s]band; and re[s]tore tranquility to two hearts which were formed for love and dome[s]tic happine[s]s.

How does thy humility exalt thee, my generous friend, [s]aid Lavinia, when he was gone; but actions like thine cannot be hid; it would be an injury to mankind to conceal them---yet it is not an action to be blazoned from the trump of common [s]ame, but gratitude [s]hall [s]natch a gentler clarion, and tell thy virtues to the li[s]tening few who know how to admire and imitate them. I left her with a heart at ea[s]e. It was the clo[s]e of the evening---pa[s][s]ing through a public [s]treet, I heard the [s]ound of mu[s]ic, and [s]aw a room in an hou[s]e of entertainment elegantly illuminated--- I took the advantage of my ring, and went in---It was an entertainment given at the expence of Mr. Woudbe---the kind, the friendly, Mr. Woudbe, was lavi[s]hing in folly and di[s][s]ipation a [s]um which might have lightened the hearts of the mi[s]erable, and dried the tear of de[s]pondency---But he could not [s]hew his ta[s]te in giving or lending money--- he could di[s]play his elegant fancy by [s]pending it on trifles, or, in reality, throwing it away. You mu[s]t not lo[s]e a moment, Sir, [s]aid a foot-man, addre[s][s]ing a man in the coffee room, whom I knew to be an attorney---You mu[s]t make all po[s][s]ible ha[s]te, for my ma[s]ter cannot live three hours. The attorney was a tall, meagre man; had a great deal of [s]ervile politene[s]s and outward [s]anctity in his manner; yet there was an under de[s]igning ca[s]t with his eyes, which made me [s]u[s]pect the integrity of his heart. He is going to make a will, [s]aid I---perhaps [s]ome rich, old mi[s]er is at the point of death, and is willing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] to di[s]po[s]e of his hoards in the be[s]t manner he can--- I will accompany the attorney. We were [s]at down at the door of an hand[s]ome hou[s]e, and I followed Mr. Vellum un[s]een into the chamber of the [s]ick man. He appeared to be between the age of forty and fifty; his looks were venerable, but his features were marked by the hand of death---behind his pillow, [s]upporting his head, [s]at a lovely girl about fourteen years old, who while [s]he, with her hand, wiped away the [s]weat which [s]tood upon the forehead of the dying man, bedewed it again with her tears---At the foot of the bed [s]tood a youth [s]omething older than the girl; he leaned again[s]t the [s]upporter of the bed; the curtain partly hid his face, but the part which was expo[s]ed to view, [s]poke filial love, anxiety and [s]orrow. My good friend, Mr. Vellum, [s]aid the [s]ick man, [s]eebly [s]tretching out his hand, I am glad you are come: I feel the [s]prings of life almo[s]t worn out, and I wi[s]h to [s]ettle my worldly affairs, that my dear Julietta and Horace may have no trouble from my relations. You know, Mr. Vellum, I married their mother contrary to the inclination of my father, and on that account, at his decea[s]e, found my[s]elf po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of but a [s]mall patrimony: willing to provide, not only for the pre[s]ent moment, but al[s]o for futurity, I entered into partner[s]hip with an eminent merchant, and my [s]ucce[s]s being beyond my hopes, I not only lived in affluence, but am enabled to leave my beloved children [s]ufficient to place them above temptation, and give them the exalted plea[s]ure of admini[s]tering to the nece[s][s]ities of their fellow creatures---I have experienced [s]o much malignity and envy from my own relations, that I think them by no means fit [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] guardians for my children. My wife was poor, and an orphan; [s]he had many relations, but no friends. Tho[s]e who will not befriend a de[s]olate orphan, are not proper people to be entru[s]ted with the care and management of young, volatile minds---You, my friend, have a [s]on, about the age of Horace; and a daughter [s]ome years older than Julietta; they will be [s]it companions for each other. I do not think my children can be happier than under your guardianship and protection---I have in the funds thirty thousand pounds--- I de[s]ire you will divide it equally between my children; and in ca[s]e of their dying without i[s][s]ue, it [s]hall devolve to you and yours---I [s]hall leave you other te[s]timonies of my regard, and a few legacies to my [s]ervants---pray be quick, I am ha[s]tening toward my end--- Mr. Vellum wrote the will, the old gentleman [s]igned it, and two of the [s]ervants witne[s][s]ed it. Mr. Vellum [s]eemed greatly affected, profe[s][s]ed much e[s]teem for the lovely children, and declared the whole [s]tudy of his life [s]hould be to make them happy--- he embraced, and pretended to weep over his friend, but methought there was more of joy than [s]orrow in his tears---The will in his po[s][s]e[s][s]ion gave him greater [s]atisfaction, than the death of his friend gave him pain. The old gentleman de[s]iring to be left to himself a few moments, the attorney and the children withdrew---He offered up [s]ome pious ejaculations, reque[s]ting the ble[s][s]ings [s]o abundantly [s]hower'd on him[s]elf might be continued to his children; his heart overflowed with gratitude for the many mercies he had enjoyed; he petitioned health and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] prosperity for his friends, penitence and pardon for his enemies, and fini[s]hed his prayer by [s]ervently recommending his [s]oul to the mercy of that Being who had guided and [s]upported him through life. This e[s][s]ential duty fini[s]hed, he again called for his children. My dear Horace and Julietta, [s]aid he, I am summoned from you; early, my children, you are bere[s]t of the love, attention, and advice of a parent, who had no other regard for life than as it contributed to your happine[s]s---I have but one precept I with to inculcate and impre[s]s upon your minds: deal by all mankind as you wi[s]h and expect them to deal by you; let nothing, my children, alienate your affections from each other; and remember to re[s]pect your brother and [s]i[s]ter mortals, not according to the homage which the mi[s]taken world may think due to wealth and grandeur, but according to their own intrin[s]ic worth and merit. Horace, re[s]pect virtue wherever you find it; nor dare on any account u[s]e the wealth of which Heaven has appointed you [s]teward, to corrupt integrity, or pervert innocence; [s]hun the [s]ociety of the licentious, though dignified with titles; regard not the [s]coffs of the libertine, but pre[s]erve un[s]haken your integrity to God and man. Julietta, my beloved girl, fly from the voice of adulation; beware of in[s]idious villains, who [s]pread their [s]pecious [s]nares for youth and innocence; guard with uncea[s]ing vigilance your honor and your [s]ame; yet, my dear girl, exult not in the pride of your own virtue, nor triumph over the wretched fallen of your [s]ex; be uniformly good; be innocent your[s]elf, but pity and lament the mi[s]ery of tho[s]e who have forfeited that ine[s]timable jewel; pour the balm of comfort into their bleeding hearts, and learn from their errors to rectify your own.

Oh! take me with you, dear [s]aint, cried Julietta, wildly cla[s]ping her hands---[s]he threw her[s]elf on the bed and fainted. The grief of Horace was manly, but expre[s][s]ive--- the tears rolled down his cheeks---he walked about the room in [s]ilent agony---till [s]eeing his [s]i[s]ter's situation, he forgot his own [s]orrows, and endeavoured to revive and comfort her. Lovely children, [s]aid I, as I left the hou[s]e, you are now launched into a world full of temptations to vice, which will approach you under the fa[s]cinating form of plea[s]ure.---May you avoid the rocks and quick [s]ands on which [s]o many youths of both [s]exes are wrecked. I do not like Mr. Vellum, [s]aid I, making a quick tran[s]ition from the orphans to the guardian.---I wi[s]h he may di[s]charge his tru[s]t faithfully. Hang this [s]u[s]picion, continued I, it is an uncharitable, unchri[s]tian-like thing that has crept into my mind under the [s]hape of anxiety for the welfare of tho[s]e poor orphans.---There's another fooli[s]h idea now; how is it po[s][s]ible a per[s]on can be poor who has fifty thou[s]and pounds to their fortune; it may [s]eem an inexplicable riddle to the narrow minded race of mortals who place the [s]ummum bonum of [s]ublunary happine[s]s in an o[s]tentatious di[s]play of wealth and grandeur: but I can a[s][s]ure them a per[s]on po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of fifty times that [s]um, may be poor, and [s]o poor as to be mi[s]erable.

Impo[s][s]ible, had I ten more added to that five, I [s]hould be the happie[s]t mortal breathing---and it is quite out of the que[s]tion to think of ever being poor again. A well-a-day, [s]aid I, 'tis a [s]trange thing; but, to me, poverty of ideas and meanne[s]s of [s]pirit are greater afflictions than poverty of pur[s]e and meanne[s]s of birth. When a man is alone, and in a thinking mood, his imagination in[s]en[s]ibly runs from one thing to another, till he entirely wanders from the [s]ubject that fir[s]t engaged his attention. Now, this being my ca[s]e, I had got into [s]uch a train of thought on the various kinds of poverty with which the world is infe[s]ted, that it was with difficulty I brought my mind back to Horace and Julietta; and, when I did, that devili[s]h [s]u[s]picion of their guardian's integrity would creep along with them. P[s]haw [s]aid I, what bu[s]ine[s]s have I to [s]u[s]pect a man of ba[s]ene[s]s, to which, perhaps, he may be an entire [s]tranger. I declare, weak mortal as I am, I find [s]ufficient employ in correcting my own errors, without [s]earching out the errors of others. I endeavoured to give my thoughts another turn, but in vain, they involuntarily turned back to the orphans, and I wandered on, mu[s]ing on the uncertainty of their future happine[s]s.

She caught my hand as I pa[s][s]ed her. Give me a gla[s]s of wine, [s]aid [s]he. The watch had ju[s]t gone ten. I looked in her face---[s]he was pretty; and I thought her features were not of the [s]ort which never expre[s]s [s]hame; her eyes were ca[s]t down---I thought I [s]aw a tear [s]teal from them---I touched her cheek, it was wet, yet [s]he forced a [s]mile[s]---I took hold of her hand, it was cold, it trembled. My compa[s][s]ion was [s]trongly excited---by an involuntary motion I drew her hand under my arm, and walked on in [s]ilence till we came to another hou[s]e of entertainment.---I then gave her [s]omething to procure refre[s]hment, and bade her good night. Then you will not go in with me, [s]aid [s]he, in tremulous accents. I mu[s]t not, [s]aid I, I have a wife. Go, then, [s]aid [s]he, letting go my arm. Yet, I thought I had found a friend, and would have told you [s]uch a tale---but, no matter---I am wretched--- I have made others [s]o---I will not [s]in again[s]t conviction. While this la[s]ts, [s]aid [s]he, I will live unpolluted--- when it is gone I mu[s]t either [s]tarve or [s]in again. Now let the icy [s]ons of philo[s]ophy [s]ay what they plea[s]e. I could no more have left this poor girl after [s]uch a declaration, than I could travel bare-foot over the burning de[s]erts of Arabia.---So, without once a[s]king the advice of Madam Prudence, or [s]uffering Su[s]picion to hint that her affliction might be a[s][s]umed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v2&image=324-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] \---I again took hold of her hand, and we entered the hou[s]e together. And now for your tale, my poor afflicted, [s]aid I, after [s]he had eaten an hearty [s]upper of cold veal and [s]allad. To engage your friend[s]hip, Sir, [s]aid [s]he, I mu[s]t be open and candid, and often condemn my[s]elf---I know I [s]tand convicted before the world, but the world fees not the heart.---Credulity was my fault; a vile platonic [s]y[s]tem my ruin. Yet, had I been ruined alone, it were but little con[s]equence; but, alas! I have involved others in mi[s]ery---I have [s]own thorns on the conjugal pillow of a worthy woman---I have torn the heart of a parent with all the dreadful pangs an injured wife, a doating mother can feel, who [s]ees the hu[s]band of her affections, the father of her children eagerly pur[s]uing, and encouraged in a guilty pa[s][s]ion. Gracious God, cried [s]he, cla[s]ping her hands, let my [s]orrows, my mi[s]eries, my unfeigned penitence expiate this fault, and for the re[s]t thy will be done. I know not how it was; but, though [s]he [s]o [s]trongly accu[s]ed her[s]elf, and of [s]uch heinous offences, for my [s]oul I could not but pity her; and [s]o did my dear Emma too, when I told her the tale; [s]o I bade her to be comforted, and I would [s]erve her in every thing that lay in my power--- But to the tale--- You [s]hall have it directly, good ladies---I know you love a little private hi[s]tory. Mercy on me! cried Mi[s]s Autumn, what [s]ort of a [s]tory are we to have now? the hi[s]tory of a filthy creature who lived with another woman's hu[s]band, and then turned [s]treet walker? Even [s]o, dear Madam; and if your immaculate mode[s]ty will be too much [s]hocked at the recital in [
