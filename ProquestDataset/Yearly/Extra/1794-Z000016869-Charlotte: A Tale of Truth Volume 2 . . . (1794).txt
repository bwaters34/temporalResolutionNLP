Will the voice of approbation no more meet my ear? and [s]hall I never again po[s][s]e[s]s a friend, who[s]e face will wear a [s]inile of joy whenever I approach? Alas! how thoughtle[s]s, how dreadfully imprudent have I been! I know not which is mo[s]t painful to endure, the [s]neer of contempt, or the glance of compa[s][s]ion, which is depicted in the various countenances of my own [s]ex: they are both equally humiliating. Ah! my dear parents, could you now [s]ee the child of your affections, the daughter whom you [s]o dearly loved, a poor [s]olitary being, without [s]ociety, here wearing out her heavy hours in deep regret and angui[s]h of heart, no kind friend of her own [s]ex to whom [s]he can unbo[s]om her griefs, no beloved mother, no woman of character will appear in my company, and low as your Charlotte is fallen, [s]he cannot a[s][s]ociate with infamy." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] The[s]e were the painful reflections which occupied the mind of Charlotte. Montraville had placed her in a [s]mall hou[s]e a few miles from New-York: he gave her one female attendant, and [s]upplied her with what money [s]he wanted; but bu[s]ine[s]s and plea[s]ure [s]o entirely occupied his time, that he had little to devote to the woman whom he had brought from all her connections, and robbed of innocence. Sometimes, indeed, he would [s]teal out at the clo[s]e of evening, and pa[s]s a few hours with her; and then [s]o much was [s]he attached to him, that all her [s]orrows were forgotten while ble[s]t with his [s]ociety: [s]he would enjoy a walk by moonlight, or [s]it by him in a little arbour at the bottom of the garden, and play on the harp, accompanying it with her plaintive, harmonious voice. But often, very often, did he promi[s]e to renew his vi[s]its, and, forgetful of his promi[s]e, leave her to mourn her di[s]appointment. What painful hours of expectation would [s]he pa[s]s! [s]he would [s]it at a window which looked toward a field he u[s]ed to cro[s]s, counting the minutes, and straining her eyes to catch the fir[s]t glimp[s]e of his per[s]on, till blinded with tears of di[s]appointment, [s]he would lean her head on her hands, and give free vent to her [s]orrows: then catching at [s]ome new hope, [s]he would again renew her watchful po[s]ition, till the [s]hades of evening enveloped every object in a du[s]ky cloud: [s]he would then renew her complaints, and, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] with a heart bur[s]ting with di[s]appointed love and wounded [s]en[s]ibility, retire to a bed which remor[s]e had [s]trewed with thorns, and court in vain that comforter of weary nature (who [s]eldom vi[s]its the unhappy) to come and [s]teep her [s]en[s]es in oblivion. Who can form an adequate idea of the [s]orrow that preyed upon the mind of Charlotte? The wife, who[s]e brea[s]t glows with affection to her hu[s]band, and who in return meets only indifference, can but faintly conceive her angui[s]h. Dreadfully painful is the [s]ituation of [s]uch a woman, but [s]he has many comforts of which our poor Charlotte was deprived. The duteous, faithful wife though treated with indifference, has one [s]olid plea[s]ure within her own bo[s]om, [s]he can reflect that [s]he has not de[s]erved neglect---that [s]he has ever fulfilled the duties of her [s]tation with the [s]tricte[s]t exactne[s]s; [s]he may hope, by con[s]tant a[s][s]iduity and unremitted attention, to recall her wanderer, and be doubly happy in his returning affection; [s]he knows he cannot leave her to unite him[s]elf to another: he cannot ca[s]t her out to poverty and contempt; [s]he looks around her, and [s]ees the [s]mile of friendly welcome, or the tear of affectionate con[s]olation, on the face of every person whom [s]he favours with her e[s]teem; and from all the[s]e circum[s]tances [s]he gathers comfort: but the poor girl by thoughtle[s]s pa[s][s]ion led a[s]tray, who, in parting with her honour, has for[s]eited the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] e[s]teem of the very man to whom [s]he has [s]acrificed every thing dear and valuable in life, feels his indifference in the fruit of her own folly, and laments her want of power to recall his lo[s]t affection: [s]he knows there is no tie but honour, and that, in a man who has been guilty of [s]eduction, is but very feeble: he may leave her in a moment to [s]hame and want; he may marry and for[s]ake her for ever; and [s]hould he, [s]he has no redre[s]s, no friendly [s]oothing companion to pour into her wounded mind the balm of con[s]olation, no benevolent hand to lead her back to the path of rectitude; [s]he has di[s]graced her friends, forfeited the good opinion of the world, and undone her[s]elf; [s]he feels her[s]elf a poor [s]olitary being in the mid[s]t of [s]urrounding multitudes; [s]hame bows her to the earth, remor[s]e tears her di[s]tracted mind, and guilt, poverty, and di[s]ea[s]e clo[s]e the dreadful [s]cene: [s]he [s]inks unnoticed to oblivion. The finger of contempt may point out to [s]ome pa[s][s]ing daughter of youthful mirth, the humble bed where lies this frail [s]i[s]ter of mortality; and will [s]he, in the unbounded gaity of her heart, exult in her own unblemi[s]hed fame, and triumph over the [s]ilent a[s]hes of the dead? Oh no! has [s]he a heart of [s]en[s]ibility, [s]he will [s]top, and thus addre[s]s the unhappy victim of folly--- "Thou had'[s]t thy faults, but [s]ure thy sufferings have expiated them: thy errors brought thee to an early grave; but thou wert a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] fellowcreature---thou ha[s]t been unhappy---then be tho[s]e errors forgotten." Then, as [s]he [s]toops to pluck the noxious weed from off the [s]od, a tear will fall and con[s]ecrate the [s]pot to Charity. For ever honoured be the [s]acred drop of humanity: the angel of mercy [s]hall record its [s]ource, and the [s]oul from whence it [s]prang [s]hall be immortal. My dear Madam contract not your brow into a frown of di[s]approbation. I mean not to extenuate the faults of tho[s]e unhappy women who fall victims to guilt and folly; but [s]urely, when we reflect how many errors we are our[s]elves [s]ubject to, how many [s]ecret faults lie hid in the rece[s][s]es of our hearts, which we [s]hould blu[s]h to have brought into open day (and yet tho[s]e faults require the lenity and pity of a benevolent judge, or awful would be our pro[s]pect of futurity) I [s]ay my dear Madam, when we con[s]ider this, we [s]urely may pity the faults of others. Believe me, many an unfortunate female, who has once [s]trayed into the thorny paths of vice, would gladly return to virtue, was any generous friend to endeavour to rai[s]e and re-a[s][s]ure her; but alas! it cannot be, you [s]ay; the world would deride and [s]coff. Then let me tell you, Madam, 'tis a very unfeeling world, and does not de[s]erve half the ble[s][s]ings which a bountiful Providence showers upon it.

A MISTAKE DISCOVERED. Julia Franklin was the only child of a man of large property, who, at the age of eighteen, left her independent mi[s]tre[s]s of an unincumbered income of [s]even hundred a year; [s]he was a girl of a lively di[s]po[s]ition, and humane, [s]u[s]ceptible heart: [s]he re[s]ided in New-York with an uncle, who loved her too well, and had too high an opinion of her prudence, to [s]crutinize her actions [s]o much as would have been nece[s][s]ary with many young ladies, who were not ble[s]t with her di[s]cretion: [s]he was, at the time Montraville arrived at New-York, the life of [s]ociety, and the univer[s]al toa[s]t. Montraville was introduced to her by the following accident. One night when he was upon guard, a dreadful fire broke out near Mr. Franklin's hou[s]e, which, in a few hours, reduced that and [s]everal others to a[s]hes; fortunately no lives were lo[s]t, and, by the a[s][s]iduity of the [s]oldiers, much valuable property [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] was [s]aved from the flames. In the mid[s]t of the confu[s]ion an old gentleman came up to Montraville, and, putting a [s]mall box into his hands, cried--- "Keep it, my good Sir, till I come to you again;" and then ru[s]hing again into the thicke[s]t of the croud, Montraville [s]aw him no more. He waited till the fire was quite extingui[s]hed and the mob di[s]per[s]ed; but in vain: the old gentleman did not appear to claim his property; and Montraville, fearing to make an enquiry, le[s]t he [s]hould meet with impo[s]tors who might lay claim, without any legal right, to the box, carried it to his lodgings, and locked it up: he naturally imagined that the per[s]on who committed it to his care knew him, and would, in a day or two, reclaim it; but several weeks pa[s][s]ed on, and no enquiry being made, he began to be unea[s]y, and re[s]olved to examine the contents of the box, and if they were, as he [s]uppo[s]ed, valuable, to [s]pare no pains to di[s]cover, and re[s]tore them to the owner. Upon opening it, he found it contained jewels to a large amount, about two hundred pounds in money, and a miniature picture [s]et for a bracelet. On examining the picture, he thought he had [s]omewhere [s]een features very like it, but could not recollect where. A few days after, being at a public a[s][s]embly, he [s]aw Mi[s]s Franklin, and the likene[s]s was too evident to be mi[s]taken: he enquired among his brother officers if any of them knew her, and found one who was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] upon terms of intimacy in the family: "then introduce me to her immediately," [s]aid he, "for I am certain I can inform her of [s]omething which will give her peculiar plea[s]ure." He was immediately introduced, found [s]he was the owner of the jewels, and was invited to breakfast the next morning in order to their re[s]toration. This whole evening Montraville was honoured with Julia's hand; the lively [s]allies of her wit, the elegance of her manner, powerfully charmed him: he forgot Charlotte, and indulged him[s]elf in [s]aying every thing that was polite and tender to Julia. But on retiring, recollection returned. "What am I about?" [s]aid he: "though I cannot marry Charlotte, I cannot be villain enough to forsake her, nor mu[s]t I dare to trifle with the heart of Julia Franklin. I will return this box," [s]aid he, "which has been the [s]ource of [s]o much unea[s]ine[s]s already, and in the evening pay a vi[s]it to my poor melancholy Charlotte, and endeavour to forget this fa[s]cinating Julia." He aro[s]e, dre[s][s]ed him[s]elf, and taking the picture out, "I will re[s]erve this from the re[s]t," [s]aid he, "and by pre[s]enting it to her when [s]he thinks it is lo[s]t, enhance the value of the obligation." He repared to Mr. Franklin's, and found Julia in the breakfa[s]t parlor alone. "How happy am I, Madam," [s]aid he, that being the fortunate in[s]trument of [s]aving the[s]e jewels [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] has been the means of procuring me the acquaintance of [s]o amiable a lady. There are the jewels and money all [s]afe." "But where is the picture, Sir?" [s]aid Julia. "Here, Madam. I would not willingly part with it." "It is the portrait of my mother," [s]aid [s]he, taking it from him: "'tis all that remains." She pre[s][s]ed it to her lips, and a tear trembled in her eyes. Montraville glanced his eye on her grey night gown and black ribbon, and his own feelings prevented a reply. Julia Franklin was the very rever[s]e of Charlotte Temple: [s]he was tall, elegantly [s]haped, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ed much of the air and manner of a woman of fa[s]hion; her complexion was a clear brown, enlivened with the glow of health, her eyes, full, black, and [s]parkling, darted their intelligent glances through long [s]ilken la[s]hes; her hair was [s]hining brown, and her features regular and [s]triking; there was an air of innocent gaiety that played about her countenance, where good humour [s]at triumphant. "I have been mi[s]taken," [s]aid Montraville. "I imagined I loved Charlotte: but alas! I am now too late convinced my attachment to her was merely the impul[s]e of the moment. I fear I have not only entailed la[s]ting mi[s]ery on that poor girl, but al[s]o thrown a barrier in the way of my own happine[s]s, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] which it will be impo[s][s]ible to [s]urmount. I feel I love Julia Franklin with ardour and [s]incerity; yet, when in her pre[s]ence, I am [s]en[s]ible of my own inability to offer a heart worthy her acceptance, and remain [s]ilent." Full of the[s]e painful thoughts, Montraville walkout to [s]ee Charlotte: [s]he [s]aw him approach, and ran out to meet him: [s]he bani[s]hed from her countenance the air of di[s]content which ever appeared when he was ab[s]ent, and met him with a [s]mile of joy. "I thought you had forgot me, Montraville," [s]aid [s]he, "and was very unhappy." "I [s]hall never forget you, Charlotte," he replied, pre[s][s]ing her hand. The uncommon gravity of his countenance, and the brevity of his reply, alarmed her. "You are not well," [s]aid [s]he; "your hand is hot; your eyes are heavy; you are very ill." "I am a villain," [s]aid he mentally, as he turned from her to hide his emotions. "But come," continued [s]he tenderly, "you [s]hall go to bed, and I will [s]it by, and watch yon; you will be better when you have [s]lept." Montraville was glad to retire, and by pretending [s]leep, hid the agitation of his mind from her penetrating eye. Charlotte watched by him till a late hour, and then, lying [s]oftly down, by his [s]ide, [s]unk into a profound [s]leep, from whence [s]he awoke not till late the next morning. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] Virtue never appears [s]o amiable as when reaching forth her hand to rai[s]e a fallen [s]i[s]ter. Chapter of Accidents . When Charlotte awoke, [s]he mi[s][s]ed Montraville; but thinking he might have ari[s]en early to enjoy the beauties of the morning, [s]he was preparing to follow him, when ca[s]ting her eye on the table, [s]he [s]aw a note, and opening it ha[s]tily, found the[s]e words--- "My dear Charlotte mu[s]t not be [s]urpri[s]ed, if [s]he does not [s]ee me again for [s]ome time: unavoidable bu[s]ine[s]s will prevent me that plea[s]ure: be a[s][s]ured I am quite well this morning; and what your fond imagination magnified into illne[s]s, was nothing more than fatigue, which a few hours re[s]t has entirely removed. Make your[s]elf happy and be certain of the unalterable friend[s]hip of " Montraville ." " Friend[s]hip! " [s]aid Charlotte emphatically, as [s]he fini[s]hed the note, "is it come to this at la[s]t? Alas! poor for[s]aken Charlotte, thy doom is now but too apparent. Montraville is no longer interested in thy happine[s]s; and [s]hame, remor[s]e, and di[s]appointed love will henceforth be thy only attendents." Though the[s]e were the ideas that involuntarily [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] ru[s]hed upon the mind of Charlotte as [s]he peru[s]ed the fatal note, yet after a few hours had elap[s]ed, the [s]yren hope again took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of her bo[s]om, and [s]he flattered her[s]elf [s]he could, on a [s]econd perusal, di[s]cover an air of tenderne[s]s in the few lines he had left, which at fir[s]t had e[s]caped her notice. "He certainly cannot be [s]o ba[s]e as to leave me," [s]aid [s]he, "and in [s]tiling him[s]elf my friend does he not promi[s]e to protect me. I will not torment myself with the[s]e cau[s]ele[s]s fears; I will place a confidence in his honour; and [s]ure he will not be [s]o unju[s]t as to abu[s]e it." Ju[s]t as [s]he had by this manner of rea[s]oning brought her mind to [s]ome tolerable degree of composure, [s]he was [s]urpri[s]ed by a vi[s]it from Belcour. The dejection vi[s]ible in Charlotte's countenance, her [s]woln eyes and neglected attire, at once told him [s]he was unhappy: he made no doubt but Montraville had, by his coldne[s]s, alarmed her [s]u[s]picions, and was re[s]olved, if po[s][s]ible, to rou[s]e her to jealou[s]y, urge her to reproach him, and by that means occa[s]ion a breach between them. "If I can once convince her that [s]he has a rival," [s]aid he, "[s]he will li[s]ten to my pa[s][s]ion if it is only to revenge his [s]lights." Belcour knew but little of the female heart; and what he did know was only of tho[s]e of loo[s]e and di[s][s]olute lives. He had no idea that a woman might fall a victim to imprudence, and yet retain [s]o [s]trong a [s]en[s]e of honour, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] as to reject with horror and contempt every solicitation to a [s]econd fault. He never imagined that a gentle, generous female heart, once tenderly attached, when treated with unkindne[s]s might break, but would never harbour a thought of revenge. His vi[s]it was not long, but before he went he fixed a [s]corpion in the heart of Charlotte, who[s]e venom embittered every future hour of her life. We will now return for a moment to Colonel Crayton. He had been three months married, and in that little time had di[s]covered that the conduct of his lady was not [s]o prudent as it ought to have been: but remon[s]trance was vain; her temper was violent; and to the Colonel's great misfortune he had conceived a [s]incere affection for her: [s]he [s]aw her own power, and, with the art of a Circe, made every action appear to him in what light [s]he plea[s]ed: his acquaintance laughed at his blindne[s]s, his friends pitied his in[s]atuation, his amiable daughter, Mrs. Beauchamp, in [s]ecret deplored the lo[s]s of her father's affection, and grieved that he [s]hould be [s]o entirely [s]wayed by an artful, and, [s]he much feared, infamous woman. Mrs. Beauchamp was mild and engaging; [s]he loved not the hurry and bu[s]tle of a city, and had prevailed on her hu[s]band to take a hou[s]e a few miles from New-York. Chance led her into the [s]ame neighbourhood with Charlotte; their hou[s]es [s]tood [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] within a [s]hort [s]pace of each other, and their gardens joined: [s]he had not been long in her new habitation before the figure of Charlotte [s]truck her; [s]he recollected her intere[s]ting features; [s]he [s]aw the melancholy [s]o con[s]picuous in her countenance, and her heart bled at the reflection, that perhaps deprived of honour, friends, all that was valuable in life, [s]he was doomed to linger out a wretched exi[s]tence in a [s]trange land, and [s]ink broken-hearted into an untimely grave. "Would to heaven I could [s]natch her from [s]o hard a fate," [s]aid [s]he; "but the mereile[s]s world has barred the doors of compa[s][s]ion again[s]t a poor weak girl, who perhaps, had [s]he one kind friend to rai[s]e and reassure her, would gladly return to peace and virtue; nay even the woman who dares to pity, and endeavour to recall a wandering [s]i[s]ter incurs the [s]neer of contempt and ridicule, for an action in which even angels are [s]aid to rejoice." The longer Mrs. Beauchamp was a witne[s]s to the [s]olitary life Charlotte led, the more [s]he wi[s]hed to [s]peak to her, and often as [s]he [s]aw her cheeks wet with the tears of angui[s]h, [s]he would [s]ay---"Dear [s]ufferer, how gladly would I pour into your heart the balm of con[s]olation, where it not for the fear of deri[s]ion." But an accident [s]oon happened which made her re[s]olve to brave even the [s]coffs of the world, rather than not enjoy the heavenly [s]atisfaction of comforting a de[s]ponding fellow-creature. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] Mrs. Beauchamp was an early ri[s]er. She was one morning walking in the garden, leaning on her hu[s]band's arm, when the [s]ound of a harp attracted their notice: they li[s]tened attentively, and heard a [s]oft melodious voice di[s]tinctly [s]ing the following [s]tanzas: Thou glorious orb, [s]upremely bright, Ju[s]t ri[s]ing from the [s]ea, To chear all nature with thy light, What are thy beams to me? In vain thy glories bid me ri[s]e, To hail the new-born day, Alas! my morning [s]acrifice Is [s]till to weep and pray. For what are nature's charms combin'd, To one, who[s]e weary brea[s]t Can neither peace nor comfort find, Nor friend whereon to re[s]t? Oh! never! never! whil[s]t I live Can my heart's angui[s]h cea[s]e: Come, friendly death, thy mandate give, And let me be at peace. "'Tis poor Charlotte!" [s]aid Mrs. Beauchamp, the pellucid drop of humanity [s]tealing down her cheek. Captain Beauchamp was alarmed at her emotion. "What Charlotte?" [s]aid he; "do you know her?"

"I fear," continued [s]he, "the poor girl has been ba[s]ely betrayed; and if I thought you would not blame me, I would pay her a vi[s]it, offer her my friend[s]hip, and endeavour to re[s]tore to her heart that peace [s]he [s]eems to have lo[s]t, and [s]o pathetically laments. Who knows, my dear," laying her hand affectionately on his arm, "who knows but [s]he has left [s]ome kind, affectionate parents to lament her errors, and would [s]he return, they might with rapture receive the poor penitent, and wa[s]h away her faults in tears of joy. Oh! what a glorious reflection would it be for me could I be the happy in[s]trument of re[s]toring her. Her heart may not be depraved, Beauchamp." "Exalted woman!" cried Beauchamp, embracing her, "how do[s]t thou ri[s]e every moment in my e[s]teem. Follow the impul[s]e of thy generous heart, my Emily. Let prudes and fools cen[s]ure if they dare, and blame a [s]en[s]ibility they never felt: I will exultingly tell them that the heart that is truly virtuous is ever inclined to pity and forgive the errors of its fellow creatures." A beam of exulting joy played round the animated countenance of Mrs. Beauchamp at the[s]e encomiums be[s]towed on her by a beloved hu[s]band, the mo[s]t delightful [s]en[s]ations pervaded her heart, and, having breakfa[s]ted, [s]he prepared to vi[s]it Charlotte.

Pope . When Mrs. Beauchamp was dre[s][s]ed, [s]he began to feel embarra[s][s]ed at the thought of beginning an acquaintance with Charlotte, and was di[s]tre[s][s]ed how to make the fir[s]t vi[s]it. "I cannot go without [s]ome introduction," [s]aid [s]he, "it will look [s]o like impertinent curio[s]ity." At length recollecting her[s]elf, [s]he [s]tepped into the garden, and gathering a few fine cucumbers, took them in her hand by way of apology for her vi[s]it. A glow of con[s]cious [s]hame vermillioned Charlotte's face as Mrs. Beauchamp entered. "You will pardon me, Madam," [s]aid [s]he, "for not having before paid my re[s]pects to [s]o amiable a neighbour; but we Engli[s]h people always keep up that re[s]erve which is the characteri[s]tic of our nation wherever we go. I have taken the liberty to bring you a few cucumbers, for I ob[s]erved you had none in your garden." Charlotte, though naturally polite and well-bred, was [s]o confu[s]ed [s]he could hardly [s]peak. Her kind vi[s]itor endeavoured to relieve her by not noticing her embarra[s][s]ment. "I am come, Madam," [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] continued [s]he, "to reque[s]t you will [s]pend the day with me. I [s]hall be alone; and, as we are both [s]trangers in this country, we may hereafter be extremely happy in each other's friend[s]hip." "Your friend[s]hip, Madam," [s]aid Charlotte blu[s]hing, "is an honour to all who are favoured with it. Little as I have [s]een of this part of the world, I am no [s]tranger to Mrs. Beauchamp's goodness of heart and known humanity: but my friendship---" She pan[s]ed, glanced her eye upon her own vi[s]ible [s]ituation, and, [s]pite of her endeavours to [s]uppre[s]s them, bur[s]t into tears. Mrs. Beauchamp gue[s][s]ed the [s]ource from whence tho[s]e tears flowed. "You [s]eem unhappy, Madam," [s]aid [s]he: [s]hall I be thought worthy your confidence? will you entru[s]t me with the cau[s]e of your [s]orrow, and re[s]t on my a[s][s]urances to exert my utmo[s]t power to [s]erve you." Charlotte returned a look of gratitude, but could not [s]peak, and Mrs. Bcauchamp continued--- "My heart was intere[s]ted in your behalf the fir[s]t moment I [s]aw you, and I only lament I had not made earlier overtures towards an acquaintance; but I flatter my[s]elf you will henceforth con[s]ider me as your friend." "Oh Madam!" cried Charlotte, "I have forfeited the good opinion of all my friends; I have for[s]aken them, and undone my[s]elf." "Come, come, my dear," [s]aid Mrs. Beauchamp, "you mu[s]t not indulge the[s]e gloomy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] thoughts: you are not I hope [s]o mi[s]erable as you imagine your[s]elf: endeavour to be compo[s]ed, and let me be favoured with your company at dinner, when, if you can bring your[s]elf to think me your friend, and repo[s]e a confidence in me, I am ready to convince you it [s]hall not be abu[s]ed." She then aro[s]e and bade her good morning. At the dining hour Charlotte repaired to Mrs. Beauchamp's, and during dinner a[s][s]umed as composed an a[s]pect as po[s][s]ible; but when the cloth was removed, [s]he [s]ummoned all her re[s]olution and determined to make Mrs. Beauchamp acquainted with every circum[s]tance preceding her unfortunate elopement, and the earne[s]t de[s]ire [s]he had to quit a way of life [s]o repugnant to her feelings. With the benignant a[s]pect of an angel of mercy did Mrs. Beauchamp li[s]ten to the artle[s]s tale: [s]he was [s]hocked to the [s]oul to find how large a [s]hare La Rue had in the [s]eduction of this amiable girl, and a tear fell, when [s]he reflected [s]o vile a woman was now the wife of her father. When Charlotte had fini[s]hed, [s]he gave her a little time to collect her [s]cattered [s]pirits, and then a[s]ked her if [s]he had never written to her friends. "Oh yes, Madam," [s]aid [s]he, "frequently: but I have broke their hearts; they are either dead or have ca[s]t me off for ever, for I have never received a [s]ingle line from them."

"Would I!" [s]aid Charlotte, cla[s]ping her hands; "would not the poor [s]ailor, to[s]t on a tempe[s]tuous ocean, threatened every moment with death, gladly return to the [s]hore he had left to tru[s]t to its deceitful calmne[s]s; Oh, my dear Madam, I would return, though to do it I were obliged to walk barefooted over a burning de[s]art, and beg a [s]canty pittance of each traveller to [s]upport my exi[s]tence. I would endure it all cheerfully, could I but once more [s]ee my dear ble[s][s]ed mother, hear her pronounce my pardon, and ble[s]s me before I died; but alas! I [s]hall never [s]ee her more; [s]he has blotted the ungrateful Charlotte from her remembrance, and I [s]hall [s]ink to the grave loaded with her's and my father's cur[s]e." Mrs. Beauchamp endeavoured to [s]ooth her. "You [s]hall write to them again," [s]aid [s]he, "and I will [s]ee that the letter is [s]ent by the fir[s]t packet that [s]ails for England; in the mean time keep up your [s]pirits, and hope every thing, by daring to de[s]erve it.

Oh! never, never! whil[s]t I have exi[s]tence, will the agony of that moment be era[s]ed from my memory. It [s]eemed like the [s]eparation of [s]oul and body. What can I plead in excu[s]e for my conduct? alas! nothing! That I loved my [s]educer is but too true! yet powerful as that pa[s][s]ion is when operating in a young heart glowing with [s]en[s]ibility, it never would have conquered my affection to you, my beloved parents, had I not been encouraged, nay, urged to take the fatally imprudent [s]tep, by one of my own [s]ex, who, under the ma[s]k of friend[s]hip, drew me on to ruin. Yet think not your Charlotte was [s]o lo[s]t as to voluntarily ru[s]h into a life of infamy; no, my dear mother, deceived by the [s]pecious appearance of my betrayer, and every [s]u[s]picion lulled a[s]leep by the mo[s]t [s]olemn promi[s]es of marriage, I thought not tho[s]e promi[s]es would [s]o ea[s]ily be forgotten. I never once reflected that the man who could [s]toop to [s]eduction, would not he[s]itate to for[s]ake the wretched object of his passion, whenever his capricious heart grew weary of her tenderne[s]s. When we arrived at this place, I vainly expected him to fulfil his engagements, but was at la[s]t fatally convinced he had never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] intended to make me his wife, or if he had once thought of it, his mind was now altered. I [s]corned to claim from his humanity what I could not obtain from his love: I was con[s]cious of having forfeited the only gem that could render me respectable in the eye of the world. I locked my sorrows in my own bo[s]om, and bore my injuries in [s]ilence. But how [s]hall I proceed? This man, this cruel Montraville, for whom I [s]acrificed honour, happine[s]s, and the love of my friends, no longer looks on me with affection, but [s]corns the credulous girl whom his art has made mi[s]erable. Could you [s]ee me, my dear parents, without [s]ociety, without friends, [s]tung with remor[s]e, and (I feel the burning blu[s]h of [s]hame die my cheeks while I write it) tortured with the pangs of disappointed love; cut to the [s]oul by the indifference of him, who, having deprived me of every other comfort, no longer thinks it worth his while to [s]ooth the heart where he has planted the thorn of never-cea[s]ing regret. My daily employment is to think of you and weep, to pray for your happine[s]s and deplore my own folly: my nights are [s]carce more happy, for if by chance I clo[s]e my weary eyes, and hope [s]ome [s]mall forgetfulne[s]s of [s]orrow, [s]ome little time to pa[s]s in [s]weet oblivion, fancy, [s]till waking, wafts me home to you: I [s]ee your beloved forms, I kneel and hear the ble[s][s]ed words of peace and pardon.

At other times I [s]ee my father angry and frowning, point to horrid caves, where, on the cold damp ground, in the agonies of death, I [s]ee my dear mother and my revered grand-father. I [s]trive to rai[s]e you; you pu[s]h me from you, and [s]hrieking cry---"Charlotte, thou ha[s]t murdered me!"

While Charlotte was enjoying [s]ome [s]mall degree of comfort in the con[s]oling [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] friendship of Mrs. Beauchamp, Montraville was advancing rapidly in his affection towards Mi[s]s Franklin. Julia was an amiable girl; [s]he [s]aw only the fair [s]ide of his character; [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed an independant fortune, and re[s]olved to be happy with the man of her heart, though his rank and fortune were by no means [s]o exalted as [s]he had a right to expect; [s]he [s]aw the pa[s][s]ion which Montraville [s]truggled to conceal; [s]he wondered at his timidity, but imagined the di[s]tance fortune had placed between them occasioned his backwardne[s]s, and made every advance which [s]trict prudence and a becoming modesty would permit. Montraville [s]aw with plea[s]ure he was not indifferent to her, but a [s]park of honour which animated his bo[s]om would not [s]uffer him to take advantage of her partiality. He was well acquainted with Charlotte's [s]ituation, and he thought there would be a double cruelty in for[s]aking her at [s]uch a time: and to marry Mi[s]s Franklin, while honour, humanity, every [s]acred law, obliged him [s]till to protect and [s]upport Charlotte, was a ba[s]en[s]s which his [s]oul [s]huddered at. He communicated his unea[s]ine[s]s to Belcour: it was the very thing this pretended friend had wi[s]hed. "And do you really." [s]aid he, laughing, "he[s]itate at marrying the lovely Julia, and becoming ma[s]ter of her fortune, becau[s]e a little fooli[s]h, fond girl cho[s]e to leave her friends, and run away with you to America.

"Would to heaven," [s]aid Montraville, "I had never [s]een her; my regard for her was but the momentary pa[s][s]ion of de[s]ire, but I feel I [s]hall love and revere Julia Franklin as long as I live; yet to leave poor Charlotte in her pre[s]ent [s]ituation would be cruel beyond de[s]cription." "Oh my good [s]entimental friend," [s]aid Belcour, "do you imagine no body has a right to provide for the brat but your[s]elf." Montraville [s]tarted. "Sure," [s]aid he, "you cannot mean to in[s]inuate that Charlotte is fal[s]e." "I don't in[s]inuate it," [s]aid Belcour, "I know it." Montraville turned pale as a[s]hes. "Then there is no faith in woman," [s]aid he. "While I thought you attached to her," [s]aid Belcour with an air of indifference, "I never wished to make you unea[s]y by mentioning her perfidy, but as I know you love and are beloved by Mi[s]s Franklin, I was determined not to let the[s]e fooli[s]h [s]cruples of honour [s]tep between you and happiness, or your tenderne[s]s for the peace of a perfidious girl prevent your uniting your[s]elf to a woman of honour." "Good heavens!" [s]aid Montraville, "what [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] poignant reflections does a man endure who [s]ees a lovely woman plunged in infamy, and is con[s]cious he was her fir[s]t [s]educer; but are you certain of what you [s]ay, Belcour?" "So far," replied he, "that I my[s]elf have received advances from her which I would not take advantage of out of regard to you: but hang it, think no more about her. I dined at Franklin's today, and Julia bid me [s]eek and bring you to tea: [s]o come along, my lad, make good u[s]e of opportunity, and [s]eize the gifts of fortune while they are within your reach." Montraville was too much agitated to pa[s]s a happy evening even in the company of Julia Franklin: he determined to vi[s]it Charlotte early the next morning, tax her with her fal[s]ehood, and take an everla[s]ting leave of her; but when the morning came, he was commanded on duty, and for [s]ix weeks was prevented from putting his de[s]ign in execution. At length he found an hour to [s]pare, and walked out to [s]pend it with Charlotte: it was near four o'clock in the afternoon when he arrived at her cottage: [s]he was not in the parlour, and without calling the [s]ervant he walked up [s]tairs, thinking to find her in her bed room. He opened the door, and the fir[s]t object that met his eyes was Charlotte a[s]leep on the bed, and Belcour by her [s]ide. "Death and di[s]traction," [s]aid he, [s]tamping, "this is too much. Ri[s]e, villain, and defend [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] yourself." Belcour [s]prang from the bed. The noi[s]e awoke Charlotte: terrified at the furious appearance of Montraville, and [s]eeing Belcour with him in the chamber, [s]he caught hold of his arm as he [s]tood by the bed [s]ide, and eagerly a[s]ked what was the matter. "Treacherous infamous girl," [s]aid he, "can you a[s]k? How came he here?" pointing to Belcour. "As heaven is my witne[s]s," replied [s]he weeping, "I do not know. I have not [s]een him for the[s]e three weeks." "Then you confe[s]s he [s]ometimes vi[s]its you?" "He came [s]ometimes by your de[s]ire." "'Tis fal[s]e; I never de[s]ired him to come, and you know I did not: but mark me, Charlotte, from this in[s]tant our connexion is at an end. Let Belcour, or any other of your favoured lovers, take you and provide for you: I have done with you for ever." He was then going to leave her: but [s]tarting wildly from the bed, [s]he threw her[s]elf on her knees before him, prote[s]ting her innocence and entreating him not to leave her. "Oh Montraville," [s]aid [s]he, "kill me, for pity's [s]ake kill me, but do not doubt my fidelity. Do not leave me in this horrid [s]ituation; for the [s]ake of your unborn child, oh! [s]purn not the wretched mother from you." "Charlotte," [s]aid he, with a firm voice, "I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] [s]hall take care that neither you nor your child want any thing in the approaching painful hour; but we meet no more." He then endeavoured to rai[s]e her from the ground: but in vain: [s]he clung about his knees, entreating him to believe her innocent, and conjuring Belcour to clear up the dreadful my[s]tery. Belcour ca[s]t on Montraville a [s]mile of contempt: it irritated him almo[s]t to madne[s]s; he broke from the feeble arms of the di[s]tre[s][s]ed girl; [s]he [s]hricked and [s]ell pro[s]trate on the floor. Montraville in[s]tantly left the hou[s]e and returned ha[s]tily to the city. MYSTERY DEVELOPED. Unfortunately for Charlotte, about three weeks before this unhappy rencontre, Captain Beauchamp, being ordered to Rhodelsland, his lady had accompanied him, [s]o that Charlotte was deprived of her friendly advice and con[s]oling [s]ociety. The afternoon on which Montraville had vi[s]ited her [s]he had found her[s]elf languid and fatigued, and after making a very [s]light dinner had lain down to endeavour to recruit her exhau[s]ted [s]pirits, and, contrary to her expectations, had fallen a[s]leep. She had not long been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] lain down, when Belcour arrived, for he took every opportunity of vi[s]iting her, and [s]triving to awaken her re[s]entment again[s]t Montraville. He enquired of the [s]ervant where her mi[s]tre[s]s was, and being told [s]he was a[s]leep, took up a book to amu[s]e him[s]elf: having [s]at a few minutes, he by chance ca[s]t his eyes towards the road, and [s]aw Montraville approaching; he in[s]tantly conceived the diabolical [s]cheme of ruining the unhappy Charlotte in his opinion for ever; he therefore [s]tole [s]oftly up [s]tairs, and laying him[s]elf by her [s]ide with the greate[s]t precaution, for fear [s]he [s]hould awake, was in that [s]ituation di[s]covered by his credulous friend. When Montraville [s]purned the weeping Charlotte from him, and left her almo[s]t di[s]tracted with terror and de[s]pair, Belcour rai[s]ed her from the floor, and leading her down [s]tairs, a[s][s]umed the part of a tender, con[s]oling friend; [s]he li[s]tened to the arguments he advanced with apparent compo[s]ure; but this was only the calm of a moment: the remembrance of Montraville's recent cruelty again ru[s]hed upon her mind: [s]he pu[s]hed him from her with [s]ome violence, and crying---"Leave me, Sir, I be[s]eech you leave me, for much I fear you have been the cau[s]e of my fidelity being [s]u[s]pected; go, leave me to the accumulated mi[s]eries my own imprudence has brought upon me." She then left him with precipitation, and retiring to her own apartment, threw her[s]elf on the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] bed, and gave vent to an agony of grief, which it is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe. It now occurred to Belcour that [s]he might possibly write to Montraville, and endeavour to convince him of her innocence: he was well aware of her pathetic remon[s]trances, and, [s]en[s]ible of the tenderne[s]s of Montraville's heart, re[s]olved to prevent any letters ever reaching him: he therefore called the [s]ervant, and, by the powerful per[s]ua[s]ion of a bribe, prevailed with her to promi[s]e whatever letters her mi[s]tre[s]s might write [s]hould be [s]ent to him. He then left a polite, tender note for Charlotte, and returned to New-York. His fir[s]t business was to [s]eek Montraville, and endeavour to convince him that what had happened would ultimately tend to his happine[s]s: he found him in his apartment, [s]olitary, pen[s]ive, and wrapped in disagreeable reflexions. "Why how now, whining, pining lover?" [s]aid he, clapping him on the [s]houlder. Montraville [s]tarted; a momentary flu[s]h of re[s]entment crossed his cheek, but in[s]tantly gave place to a death-like palene[s]s, occa[s]ioned by painful remembrance--- remembrance awakened by that monitor, whom, though we may in vain endeavour, we can never entirely [s]ilence. "Belcour," [s]aid he, "you have injured me in a tender point." "Prithee, Jack," replied Belcour, "do not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] make a [s]erious matter of it: how could I refu[s]e the girl's advances? and thank heaven [s]he is not your wife." "True," [s]aid Montraville; "but [s]he was innocent when I fir[s]t knew her. It was I [s]educed her, Belcour. Had it not been for me, [s]he had [s]till been virtuous and happy in the affection and protection of her family." "P[s]haw," replied Belcour, laughing, "if you had not taken advantage of her ea[s]y nature, [s]ome other would, and where is the difference, pray?" "I wi[s]h I had never [s]een her," cried he passionately, and [s]tarting from his [s]eat. "Oh that cur[s]ed French woman," added he with vehemence, "had it not been for her, I might have been happy---" He pau[s]ed. "With Julia Franklin," [s]aid Belcour. The name, like a [s]udden [s]park of electric fire, [s]eemed for a moment to [s]u[s]pend his faculties---for a moment he was transfixed; but recovering, he caught Belcour's hand, and cried---" Stop! [s]top! I be[s]eech you, name not the lovely Julia and the wretched Montraville in the [s]ame breath. I am a [s]educer, a mean, ungenerous [s]educer of unsuspecting innocence. I dare not hope that purity like her's would [s]toop to unite it[s]elf with black, premeditated guilt: yet by heavens I [s]wear, Belcour, I thought I loved the lo[s]t, abandoned Charlotte till I [s]aw Julia---I thought I never could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] forsake her; but the heart is deceitful, and I now can plainly di[s]criminate between the impul[s]e of a youthful pa[s][s]ion, and the pure flame of disinterested affection." At that in[s]tant Julia Franklin pa[s][s]ed the window, leaning on her uncle's arm. She curt[s]ied as [s]he pa[s][s]ed, and, with the bewitching [s]mile of mode[s]t chearfulne[s]s, cried---" Do you bury yourselves in the hou[s]e this fine evening, gents?" There was [s]omething in the voice! the manner! the look! that was altogether irre[s]i[s]tible. "Perhaps [s]he wi[s]hes my company," [s]aid Montraville mentally, as he [s]natched up his hat: "if I thought [s]he loved me, I would con[s]e[s]s my errors, and tru[s]t to her genero[s]ity to pity and pardon me." He [s]oon overtook her, and offering her his arm, they [s]auntered to plea[s]ant but unfrequented walks. Belcour drew Mr. Franklin on one [s]ide and entered into a political di[s]cour[s]e: they walked fa[s]ter than the young people, and Belcour by [s]ome means contrived entirely to lo[s]e [s]ight of them. It was a fine evening in the beginning of autumn; the la[s]t remains of day-light faintly [s]treaked the we[s]tern [s]ky, while the moon, with pale and virgin lu[s]tre, in the room of gorgeous gold and purple, ornamented the canopy of heaven with [s]ilver, fleecy clouds, which now and then half hid her lovely face, and, by partly concealing, heightened every beauty; the zephyrs [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] whi[s]pered [s]oftly through the trees, which now began to [s]hed their leafy honours; a [s]olemn [s]ilence reigned: and to a happy mind an evening [s]uch as this would give [s]erenity, and calm, unru[s]fled pleasure; but to Montraville, while it [s]oothed the turbulence of his pa[s][s]ions, it brought increa[s]e of melancholy reflections. Julia was leaning on his arm: he took her hand in his, and pre[s][s]ing it tenderly, [s]ighed deeply, but continued [s]ilent. Julia was embarra[s][s]ed; [s]he wi[s]hed to break a [s]ilence [s]o unaccountable, but was unable; [s]he loved Montraville, [s]he [s]aw he was unhappy, and wi[s]hed to know the cau[s]e of his uneafine[s]s, but that innate mode[s]ty which nature has implanted in the female brea[s]t, prevented her enquiring. "I am bad company, Mi[s]s Franklin," [s]aid he, at la[s]t recollecting him[s]elf; but I have met with [s]omething to-day that has greatly di[s]tre[s][s]ed me, and I cannot [s]hake off the di[s]agreeable impre[s][s]ion it has made on my mind." "I am [s]orry," [s]he replied, "that you have any cau[s]e of inquietude. I am [s]ure if you were as happy as you de[s]erve, and as all your friends wi[s]h you---" She he[s]itated. "And might I," replied he with [s]ome animation, "pre[s]ume to rank the amiable Julia in that number?" "Certainly," [s]aid [s]he, "the [s]ervice you have rendered me, the knowledge of your worth, all combine to make me e[s]teem you." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] "E[s]teem, my lovely Julia," [s]aid he pa[s][s]ionately, "is but a poor cold word. I would if I dared, if I thought I merited your attention---but no, I mu[s]t not---honour forbids. I am beneath your notice, Julia, I am mi[s]erable and cannot hope to be otherwi[s]e." "Alas!" [s]aid Julia, "I pity you." "Oh thou conde[s]cending charmer," [s]aid he, "how that [s]weet word chears my [s]ad heart. Indeed if you knew all, you would pity; but at the [s]ame time I fear you would de[s]pi[s]e me." Ju[s]t then they were again joined by Mr. Franklin and Belcour. It had interrupted an intere[s]ting discourse. They found it impo[s][s]ible to conver[s]e on indifferent [s]ubjects, and proceeded home in [s]ilence. At Mr. Franklin's door Montraville again preffed Julia's hand, and faintly articulating "good night," retired to his lodgings di[s]pirited and wretched, from a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s that he de[s]erved not the affection, with which he plainly [s]aw he was honoured. RECEPTION OF A LETTER. " And where now is our poor Charlotte?" [s]aid Mr. Temple one evening, as the cold bla[s]ts of autumn whi[s]tled rudely over the heath, and the yellow appearance of the di[s]tant wood, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] [s]poke the near approach of winter. In vain the chearful fire blazled on the hearth, in vain was he [s]urrounded by all the comforts of life; the parent was [s]till alive in his heart, and when he thought that perhaps his once darling child was ere this expo[s]ed to all the mi[s]eries of want in a di[s]tant land, without a friend to [s]ooth and comfort her, without the benignant look of compa[s][s]ion to chear, or the angelic voice of pity to pour the balm of con[s]olation on her wounded heart, when he thought of this, his whole [s]oul di[s][s]olved in tenderne[s]s; and while he wiped the tear of angui[s]h from the eye of his patient, uncomplaining Lucy, he [s]truggled to suppress the [s]ympathizing drop that [s]tarted in his own. "Oh, my poor girl," [s]aid Mrs. Temple, "how mu[s]t [s]he be altered, el[s]e [s]urely [s]he would have relieved our agonizing minds by one line to [s]ay [s]he lived---to [s]ay [s]he had not quite forgot the parents who almo[s]t idolized her." "Gracious heaven," [s]aid Mr. Temple, starting from his [s]eat, "who would wi[s]h to be a father, to experience the agonizing pangs inflicted on a parent's heart by the ingratitude of a child?" Mrs. Temple wept; her father took her hand; he would have [s]aid, "be comforted my child," but the words died on his tongue. The [s]ad [s]ilence that en[s]ued was interrupted by a loud rap at the door. In a moment a [s]ervant entered with a letter in his hand. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] Mrs. Temple took it from him: [s]he ca[s]t her eyes upon the [s]uper[s]cription; [s]he knew the writing. "'Tis Charlotte," [s]aid [s]he, eagerly breaking the [s]eal, "[s]he has not quite forgot us." But before [s]he had half gone through the contents, a [s]udden sickness [s]eized her; [s]he grew cold and giddy, and putting it into her hu[s]band's hand, [s]he cried---"Read it: I cannot." Mr. Temple attempted to read it aloud, but frequently pau[s]ed to give vent to his tears. "My poor deluded child," [s]aid he, when he had fini[s]hed. "Oh, [s]hall we not forgive the dear penitent?" [s]aid Mrs. Temple. "We mu[s]t, we will my love; [s]he is willing to return, and 'tis our duty to receive her." "Father of mercy," [s]aid Mr. Eldridge, rai[s]ing his cla[s]ped hands, "let me but live once more to [s]ee the dear wanderer re[s]tored to her afflicted parents, and take me from this world of [s]orrow whenever it [s]eemeth be[s]t to thy wi[s]dom." "Yes, we will receive her," [s]aid Mr. Temple; "we will endeavour to heal her wounded [s]pirit, and [s]peak peace and comfort to her agitated [s]oul. I will write to her to return immediately." "Oh!" [s]aid Mrs. Temple, "I would if possible fly to her, [s]upport and chear the dear [s]ufferer in the approaching hour of di[s]tre[s]s, and tell her how nearly penitence is allied to virtue. Cannot we go and conduct her home, my love?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] continued [s]he, laying her hand on his arm. "My father will [s]urely forgive our ab[s]ence if we go to bring home his darling." "You cannot go, my Lucy," [s]aid Mr. Temple: "the delicacy of your frame would but poorly sustain the fatigue of a long voyage; but I will go and bring the gentle penitent to your arms; we may [s]till [s]ee many years of happine[s]s." The [s]truggle in the bo[s]om of Mrs. Temple between maternal and conjugal tenderne[s]s was long and painful. At length the former triumphed, and [s]he con[s]ented that her hu[s]band [s]hould [s]et forwad to New-York by the fir[s]t opportunity: [s]he wrote to her Charlotte in the tendere[s]t, mo[s]t con[s]oling manner, and looked forward to the happy hour, when [s]he [s]hould again embrace her, with the mo[s]t animated hope. WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED. In the mean time the pa[s][s]ion Montraville had conceived for Julia Franklin daily increa[s]ed, and he [s]aw evidently how much he was beloved by that amiable girl: he was likewi[s]e [s]trongly prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed with an idea of Charlotte's per[s]idy. What wonder then if he gave him[s]elf up to the delightful [s]en[s]ation which pervaded his bo[s]om; and finding no ob[s]tacle [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] ari[s]e to oppo[s]e his happine[s]s, he [s]olicited and obtained the hand of Julia. A few days before his marriage he thus addre[s][s]ed Belcour: "Though Charlotte, by her abandoned conduct, has thrown her[s]elf from my protection, I [s]till hold my[s]elf bound to [s]upport her till relieved from her pre[s]ent condition, and al[s]o to provide for the child. I do not intend to [s]ee her again, but I will place a [s]um of money in your liands, which will amply [s]upply her with every convenience; but [s]hould [s]he require more, let her have it, and I will [s]ee it repaid. I wi[s]h I could prevail on the poor deluded girl to return to her friends: [s]he was an only child, and I make no doubt but that they would joyfully receive her; it would [s]hock me greatly to [s]ee her henceforth leading a life of infamy, as I [s]hould always accu[s]e my[s]elf of being the primary cau[s]e of all her errors. If [s]he [s]hould chu[s]e to remain under your protection, be kind to her, Belcour, I conjure you. Let not [s]atiety prompt you to treat her in [s]uch a manner, as may drive her to actions which nece[s][s]ity might urge her to, while her better rea[s]on di[s]approved them: [s]he [s]hall never want a friend while I live, but I never more de[s]ire to behold her; her pre[s]ence would be always painful to me, and a glance from her eye would call the blu[s]h of con[s]cious guilt into my cheek. "I will write a letter to her, which you may [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] deliver when I am gone, as I [s]hall go to St. Eustatia the day after my union with Julia, who will accompany me." Belcour promi[s]ed to fulfil the reque[s]t of his friend, though nothing was farther from his intentions, than the lea[s]t de[s]ign of delivering the letter, or making Charlotte acquainted with the provi[s]ion Montraville had made for her; he was bent on the complete ruin of the unhappy girl, and [s]uppo[s]ed, by reducing her to an entire dependance on him, to bring her by degrees to con[s]ent to gratify his ungenerous pa[s][s]ion. The evening before the day appointed for the nuptials of Montraville and Julia, the former retired early to his apartment; and ruminating on the pa[s]t [s]cenes of his life, [s]uffered the keene[s]t remor[s]e in the remembrance of Charlotte's [s]eduction. "Poor girl," [s]aid he, "I will at lea[s]t write and bid her adieu; I will too endeavour to awaken that love of virtue in her bo[s]om which her unfortunate attachment to me has extingui[s]hed." He took up the pen and began to write, but words were denied him. How could he addre[s]s the woman whom he had [s]educed, and whom, though he thought unworthy his tenderne[s]s, he was about to bid adieu for ever? How [s]hould he tell her that he was going to abjure her, to enter into the mo[s]t indi[s][s]oluble ties with another, and that he could not even own the infant which [s]he bore as his child? Several letters [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] were begun and de[s]troyed: at length he completed the following: -  To Charlotte "Though I have taken up my pen to addre[s]s you, my poor injured girl, I feel I am inadequate to the ta[s]k; yet, however painful the endeavour, I could not re[s]olve upon leaving you for ever without one kind line to bid you adieu, to tell you how my heart bleeds at the remembrance of what you was, before you [s]aw the hated Montraville. Even now imagination paints the [s]cene, when, torn by contending pa[s][s]ions, when, [s]truggling between love and duty, you [s]ainted in my arms, and I lifted you into the chai[s]e: I [s]ee the agony of your mind, when, recovering, you [s]ound your[s]elf on the road to Port[s]mouth: but how, my gentle girl, how could you, when [s]o ju[s]tly impre[s][s]ed with the value of virtue, how could you, when loving as I thought you loved me, yield to the [s]olicitations of Belcour? "Oh Charlotte, con[s]cience tells me it was I, villain that I am, who fir[s]t taught you the allurements of guilty plea[s]ure; it was I who dragged you from the calm repo[s]e which innocence and virtue ever enjoy; and can I, dare I tell you, it was not love prompted to the horrid deed? No, thou dear, f[s]allen angel, believe your repentant Montraville, when he tells you the man who truly loves will never betray the object of his affection. Adieu, Charlotte: could you [s]till find charms in a life of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] unoffending innocence, return to your parents; you [s]hall never want the means of [s]upport both for your[s]elf and child. Oh! gracious heaven! may that child be entirely free from the vices of its father and the weakne[s]s of its mother. "To-morrow--- but no, I cannot tell you what to-morrow will produce; Belcour will inform you: he al[s]o has ca[s]h for you, which I beg you will a[s]k for whenever you may want it. Once more adieu: believe me, could I hear you was returned to your friends, and enjoying that tranquillity of which I have robbed you, I [s]hould be as completely happy as even you, in your fonde[s]t hours, could wi[s]h me, but till then a gloom will ob[s]cure the brighte[s]t pro[s]pects of Montraville ." After he had [s]ealed this letter he threw him[s]elf on the bed, and enjoyed a few hours repo[s]e. Early in the morning Belcour tapped at his door: he aro[s]e ha[s]tily, and prepared to meet his Julia at the altar. "This is the letter to Charlotte," [s]aid he, giving it to Belcour: "take it to her when we are gone to Eu[s]tatia; and I conjure you, my dear friend, not to u[s]e any [s]ophi[s]tical arguments to prevent her return to virtue; but [s]hould [s]he incline that way, encourage her in the thought, and a[s][s]i[s]t her to put her de[s]ign in execution. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] Pen[s]ive [s]he mourn'd, and hung her languid head, Like a fair lily overcharg'd with dew. Charlotte had now been left almo[s]t three months a prey to her own melancholy reflexions--- [s]ad companions indeed; nor did any one break in upon her [s]olitude but Belcour, who once or twice called to enquire after her health, and tell her he had in vain endeavoured to bring Montraville to hear rea[s]on; and once, but only once, was her mind cheared by the receipt of an affectionate letter from Mrs. Beauchamp. Often had [s]he wrote to her per[s]idious [s]educer, and with the mo[s]t persuasive eloquence endeavoured to convince him of her innocence; but the[s]e letters were never [s]uffered to reach the hands of Montraville, or they mu[s]t, though on the very eve of marriage, have prevented his de[s]erting the wretched girl. Real angui[s]h of heart had in a great mea[s]ure faded her charms, her cheeks were pale from want of re[s]t, and her eyes, by frequent, indeed almo[s]t continued weeping, were [s]unk and heavy. Sometimes a gleam of hope would play about her heart when [s]he thought of her parents---"They cannot [s]urely," [s]he would [s]ay, "refu[s]e to forgive me; or [s]hould they deny their pardon to me, they will not hate my innocent infant on account of its mother's errors." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] How often did the poor mourner wi[s]h for the consoling pre[s]ence of the benevolent Mrs. Beauchamp. "If [s]he were here," [s]he would cry, "[s]he would certainly comfort me, and [s]ooth the di[s]traction of my [s]oul." She was [s]itting one afternoon, wrapped in the[s]e melancholy reflexions, when [s]he was interrupted by the entrance of Belcour. Great as the alteration was which ince[s][s]ant [s]orrow had made on her per[s]on [s]he was [s]till intere[s]ting, [s]till charming; and the unhallowed [s]lame, which had urged Belcour to plant diffen[s]ion between her and Montraville, [s]till raged in his bo[s]om: he was determined if poffible, to make her his mi[s]tre[s]s; nay, he had even conceived the diabolical [s]cheme of taking her to New-York, and making her appear in every public place where it was likely [s]he [s]hould meet Montraville, that he might be a witne[s]s to his unmanly triumph. When he entered the room where Charlotte was [s]itting, he a[s][s]umed the look of tender, con[s]olatory friend[s]hip. "And how does my lovely Charlotte?" [s]aid he, taking her hand: "I fear you are not [s]o well as I could wi[s]h." "I am not well, Mr. Belcour," [s]aid [s]he, "very far from it; but the pains and infirmities of the body I could ea[s]ily bear, nay, [s]ubmit to them with patience, were they not aggravated by the mo[s]t insupportable angui[s]h of my mind." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] "You are not happy, Charlotte," [s]aid he, with a look of well-di[s][s]embled [s]orrow. "Alas!" replied [s]he mournfully, [s]haking her head, "how can I be happy, de[s]erted and for[s]aken as I am, without a friend of my own [s]ex to whom I can unburthen my full heart, nay, my fidelity [s]u[s]pected by the very man for whom I have sacrificed every thing valuable in life, for whom I have made my[s]elf a poor de[s]pi[s]ed creature, an out-cast from [s]ociety, an object only of contempt and pity." "You think too meanly of your[s]elf, Mi[s]s Temple: there is no one who would dare to treat you with contempt: all who have the plea[s]ure of knowing you mu[s]t admire and e[s]teem. You are lonely here, my dear girl; give me leave to conduct you to New-York, where the agreeable [s]ociety of [s]ome ladies, to whom I will introduce you, will di[s]pel the[s]e [s]ad thoughts, and I [s]hall again [s]ee returning chearfulne[s]s animate tho[s]e lovely features." "Oh never! never!" cried Charlotte emphatically: "the virtuous part of my [s]ex will [s]corn me, and I will never a[s][s]ociate with infamy. No, Belcour, here let me hide my [s]hame and [s]orrow, here let me [s]pend my few remaining days in ob[s]curity, unknown and unpitied, here let me die unlamented, and my name [s]ink to oblivion." Here her tears [s]topped her utterance. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] Belcour was awed to [s]ilence: he dared not interrupt her; and after a moment's pau[s]e [s]he proceeded--- "I once had conceived the thought of going to New-York to [s]eek out the [s]till dear, though cruel, ungenerous Montraville, to throw my[s]elf at his feet, and entreat his compa[s][s]ion; heaven knows, not for my[s]elf; if I am no longer beloved, I will not be indebted to his pity to redre[s]s my injuries, but I would have knelt and entreated him not to for[s]ake my poor unborn---" She could [s]ay no more; a crim[s]on glow ru[s]hed over her cheeks, and covering her face with her hands, [s]he [s]obbed aloud. Something like humanity was awakened in Belcour's brea[s]t by this pathetic [s]peech: he aro[s]e and walked towards the window; but the [s]elfi[s]h pa[s][s]ion which had taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his heart [s]oon [s]tifled the[s]e finer emotions; and he thought if Charlotte was once convinced [s]he had no longer any dependance on Montraville, [s]he would more readily throw her[s]elf on his protection. Determined, therefore, to inform her of all that had happened, he again re[s]umed his [s]eat; and finding [s]he began to be more compo[s]ed, enquired if [s]he had ever heard from Montraville [s]ince the unfortunate rencontre in her bed chamber. "Ah no," [s]aid [s]he. "I fear I [s]hall never hear from him again." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] "I am greatly of your opinion," [s]aid Belcour, "for he has been for [s]ome time pa[s]t greatly attached---" At the word "attached" a death-like palene[s]s over[s]pread the countenance of Charlotte, but [s]he applied to [s]ome hart[s]horn which [s]tood be[s]ide her, and Belcour proceeded. "He has been for [s]ome time pa[s]t greatly attached to one Mi[s]s Franklin, a plea[s]ing lively girl, with a large fortune." "She may be richer, may be hand[s]omer," cried Charlotte, "but cannot love him [s]o well. Oh may [s]he beware of his art, and not tru[s]t him too far as I have done." "He addre[s][s]es her publicly," [s]aid he, "and it was rumoured they were to be married before he [s]ailed for Eu[s]tatia, whither his company is ordered." "Belcour," [s]aid Charlotte, [s]eizing his hand, and gazing at him earne[s]tly, while her pale lips trembled with convul[s]ive agony, "tell me, and tell me truly, I be[s]eech you, do you think he can be [s]uch a villain as to marry another woman, and leave me to die with want and mi[s]ery in a [s]trange land: tell me what you think; I can bear it very well; I will not [s]hrink from this heavie[s]t [s]troke of fate; I have deserved my afflictions, and I will endeavour to bear them as I ought." "I fear," [s]aid Belcour, "he can be that villain." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] "Perhaps," cried [s]he, eagerly interrupting him, "perhaps he is married already: come, let me know the wor[s]t," continued [s]he with an affected look of compo[s]ure: "you need not be afraid, I [s]hall not [s]end the unfortunate lady a bowl of poi[s]on." "Well then, my dear girl," [s]aid he, deceived by her appearance, "they were married on Thur[s]day, and ye[s]terday morning they [s]ailed for Eu[s]tatia." "Married---gone---[s]ay you?" cried [s]he in a distracted accent, "what without a la[s]t farewell, without one thought on my unhappy [s]ituation! Oh Montraville, may God forgive your perfidy." She shrieked, and Belcour [s]prang forward ju[s]t in time to prevent her falling to the floor. Alarming faintings now [s]ucceeded each other, and [s]he was conveyed to her bed, from whence [s]he earne[s]tly prayed [s]he might never more ari[s]e. Belcour [s]taid with her that night, and in the morning found her in a high fever. The fits [s]he had been [s]eized with had greatly terrified him; and confined as [s]he now was to a bed of [s]ickne[s]s, [s]he was no longer an object of de[s]ire: it is true for [s]everal days he went con[s]tantly to [s]ee her, but her pale, emaciated appearance di[s]gu[s]ted him: his vi[s]its became le[s]s frequent; he forgot the [s]olemn charge given him by Montraville; he even forgot the money entrusted to his care; and, the burning blu[s]h of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] indignation and [s]hame tinges my cheek while I write it, this di[s]grace to humanity and manhood at length forgot even the injured Charlotte; and, attracted by the blooming health of a farmer's daughter, whom he had [s]een in his frequent excur[s]ions to the country, he left the unhappy girl to [s]ink unnoticed to the grave, a prey to [s]ickne[s]s, grief and penury; while he, having triumphed over the virtue of the artle[s]s cottager, rioted in all the intemperance of luxury and lawle[s]s plea[s]ure. A TRIFLING RETROSPECT. " Bless my heart," cries my young volatile reader, "I [s]hall never have patience to get through the[s]e volumes, there are [s]o many ahs! and ohs! [s]o much fainting, tears, and di[s]tre[s]s, I am [s]ick to death of the [s]ubject." My dear, chearful, innocent girl, for innocent I will [s]uppo[s]e you to be, or you would acutely feel the woes of Charlotte, did con[s]cience [s]ay, thus might it have been with me, had not Providence interpo[s]ed to [s]natch me from de[s]truction: therefore, my lively, innocent girl, I mu[s]t reque[s]t your patience; I am writing a tale of truth: I mean to write it to the heart: but if perchance the heart is rendered impenetrable by unbounded pro[s]perity, or a continuance in vice, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] I expect not my tale to plea[s]e, nay, I even expect it will be thrown by with di[s]gu[s]t. But [s]oftly, gentle fair one; I pray you throw it not a[s]ide till you have peru[s]ed the whole; mayhap you may find [s]omething therein to repay you for the trouble. Methinks I [s]ee a [s]arca[s]tic [s]mile [s]it on your countenance.--- "And what," cry you, "does the conceited author [s]uppo[s]e we can glean from the[s]e pages, if Charlotte is held up as an object of terror, to prevent us from falling into guilty errors? does not La Rue triumph in her [s]hame, and by adding art to guilt, obtain the affection of a worthy man, and ri[s]e to a [s]tation where [s]he is beheld with re[s]pect, and chearfully received into all companies. What then is the moral you would inculcate? Would you wi[s]h us to think that a deviation from virtue, if covered by art and hypocri[s]y, is not an object of dete[s]tation, but on the contrary [s]hall rai[s]e us to fame and honour? while the haple[s]s girl who falls a victim to her too great [s]en[s]ibility, [s]hall be loaded with ignominy and [s]hame?" No, my fair queri[s]t, I mean no [s]uch thing. Remember the endeavours of the wicked are often [s]uffered to pro[s]per, that in the end their fall may be attended with more bitterness of heart; while the cup of affliction is poured out for wife and [s]alutary ends, and they who are compelled to drain it even to the bitter dregs, often find comfort at the bottom; the tear of penitence blots their offences from the book of fate, and they [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] ri[s]e from the heavy, painful trial, purified and fit for a man[s]ion in the kingdom of eternity. Yes, my young friends, the tear of compa[s][s]ion [s]hall fall for the fate of Charlotte, while the name of La Rue [s]hall be dete[s]ted and de[s]pi[s]ed. For Charlotte, the [s]oul melts with [s]ympathy; for La Rue, it feels nothing but horror and contempt. But perhaps your gay hearts would rather follow the fortunate Mrs. Crayton through the [s]cenes of plea[s]ure and di[s][s]ipation in which [s]he was engaged, than li[s]ten to the complaints and mi[s]eries of Charlotte. I will for once oblige you: I will for once follow her to midnight revels, balls, and [s]cenes of gaiety, for in [s]uch was [s]he con[s]tantly engaged. I have [s]aid her per[s]on was lovely; let us add that [s]he was [s]urrounded by [s]plendor and affluence, and he mu[s]t know but little of the world who can wonder, (however faulty [s]uch a woman's conduct,) at her being followed by the men, and her company courted by the women: in [s]hort, Mrs. Crayton was the univer[s]al favourite: [s]he [s]et the fa[s]hions, [s]he was toa[s]ted by all the gentlemen, and copied by all the ladies. Colonel Crayton was a dome[s]tic man. Could he be happy with [s]uch a woman? impo[s][s]ible! Remon[s]trance was vain: he might as well have preached to the winds, as endeavour to per[s]uade her from any action, however ridiculous, on which [s]he had [s]et her mind: in [s]hort, after a little [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] ineffectual [s]truggle, he gave up the attempt, and left her to follow the bent of her own inclinations: what tho[s]e were, I think the reader mu[s]t have [s]een enough of her character to form a ju[s]t idea. Among the number who paid their devotions at her [s]hrine, [s]he [s]ingled one, a young En[s]ign of mean birth, indifferent education, and weak intellects. How [s]uch a man came into the army, we hardly know to account for, and how he afterwards ro[s]e to po[s]ts of honour is likewi[s]e [s]trange and wonderful. But fortune is blind, and [s]o are tho[s]e too frequently who have the power of di[s]pen[s]ing her favours: el[s]e why do we [s]ee fools and knaves at the very top of the wheel, while patient merit [s]inks to the extreme of the oppo[s]ite aby[s]s. But we may form a thou[s]and conjectures on this [s]ubject, and yet never hit on the right. Let us therefore endeavour to de[s]erve her [s]miles, and whether we [s]ucceed or not, we [s]hall feel more innate [s]atisfaction, than thou[s]ands of tho[s]e who ba[s]k in the [s]un[s]hine of her favour unworthily. But to return to Mrs. Crayton; this young man, whom I [s]hall di[s]tingui[s]h by the name of Corydon, was the reigning favourite of her heart. He e[s]corted her to the play, danced with her at every ball, and when indi[s]po[s]ition prevented her going out, it was he alone who was permitted to chear the gloomy [s]olitude to which [s]he was obliged to confine her[s]elf. Did [s]he ever think of poor Charlotte?---if [s]he did, my dear Mi[s]s, it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] was only to laugh at the poor girl's want of [s]pirit in con[s]enting to be moped up in the country, while Montraville was enjoying all the plea[s]ures of a gay, di[s][s]ipated city. When [s]he heard of his marriage, [s]he [s]miling [s]aid, [s]o there's an end of Madam Charlotte's hopes. I wonder who will take her now, or what will become of the little affected prude? But as you have led to the [s]ubject, I think we may as well return to the di[s]tre[s][s]ed Charlotte, and not, like the unfeeling Mrs. Crayton, [s]hut our hearts to the call of humanity. WE GO FORWARD AGAIN. The [s]trength of Charlotte's con[s]titution combated again[s]t her di[s]order, and [s]he began [s]lowly to recover, though [s]he [s]till laboured under a violent depre[s][s]ion of [s]pirits: how mu[s]t that depre[s][s]ion be encrea[s]ed, when, upon examining her little [s]tore, [s]he found her[s]elf reduced to one [s]olitary guinea, and that during her illne[s]s the attendance of an apothecary and nur[s]e, together with many other unavoidable expences, had involved her in debt, from which [s]he [s]aw no method of extricating her[s]elf. As to the faint hope which [s]he had entertained of hearing from and being relieved by her parents; it now entirely for[s]ook her, for it was above [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] four months [s]ince her letter was di[s]patched, and [s]he had received no an[s]wer: [s]he therefore imagined that her conduct had either entirely alienated their affection from her, or broken their hearts, and [s]he mu[s]t never more hope to receive their ble[s][s]ing. Never did any human being wi[s]h for death with greater fervency or with ju[s]ter cau[s]e; yet [s]he had too ju[s]t a [s]en[s]e of the duties of the christian religion to attempt to put a period to her own exi[s]tence. "I have but to be patient a little longer," [s]he would cry, "and nature, fatigued and fainting, will throw off this heavy load of mortality, and I [s]hall be relea[s]ed from all my sufferings." It was one cold [s]tormy day in the latter end of December, as Charlotte [s]at by a handful of fire, the low [s]tate of her finances not allowing her to replenish her [s]tock of fuel, and prudence teaching her to be careful of what [s]he had, when [s]he was surprised by the entrance of a farmer's wife, who, without much ceremony, [s]eated her[s]elf, and began this curious harangue. "I'm come to [s]ee if as how you can pay your rent, becau[s]e as how we hear Captain Montable is gone away, and it's fifty to one if he b'ant killed afore he comes back again; and then, Mi[s]s, or Ma'am, or whatever you may be, as I was [s]aying to my hu[s]band, where are we to look for our money." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] This was a [s]troke altogether unexpected by Charlotte: [s]he knew [s]o little of the ways of the world that [s]he had never be[s]towed a thought on the payment for the rent of the hou[s]e; [s]he knew indeed that [s]he owed a good deal, but this was never reckoned among the others: [s]he was thunderstruck; [s]he hardly knew what an[s]wer to make, yet it was ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary that [s]he [s]hould [s]ay something: and judging of the gentlene[s]s of every female di[s]po[s]ition by her own, [s]he thought the be[s]t way to intere[s]t the woman in her favour would be to tell her candidly to what a [s]ituation [s]he was reduced, and how little probability there was of her ever paying any body. Alas poor Charlotte, how confined was her knowledge of human nature, or [s]he would have been convinced that the only way to en[s]ure the friend[s]hip and a[s][s]i[s]tance of your [s]urrounding acquaintance is to convince them you do not require it, for when once the petrifying a[s]pect of di[s]tre[s]s and penury appears, who[s]e qualities, like Medusa's head, can change to [s]tone all that look upon it; when once this Gorgon claims acquaintance with us, the phantom of friend[s]hip, that before courted our notice, will vani[s]h into unsubstantial air, and the whole world before us appear a barren wa[s]te. Pardon me, ye dear [s]pirits of benevolence, who[s]e benign [s]miles and chearfulgiving hand have [s]trewed [s]weet flowers on many a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] thorny path through which my wayward fate forced me to pa[s]s; think not, that, in condemning the unfeeling texture of the human heart, I forget the [s]pring from whence flow all the comforts I enjoy: oh no! I look up to you as to bright con[s]tellations, gathering new [s]plendours from the [s]urrounding darkne[s]s: but ah! whil[s]t I adore the benignant rays that cheared and illumined my heart, I mourn that their influence cannot extend to all the [s]ons and daughters of affliction. "Indeed, Madam," [s]aid poor Charlotte in a tremulous accent, "I am at a lo[s]s what to do. Montraville placed me here, and promi[s]ed to defray all my expen[s]es: but he has forgot his promise, he has for[s]aken me, and I have no friend who has either power or will to relieve me. Let me hope, as you [s]ee my unhappy [s]ituation, your charity---" "Charity," cried the woman impatiently interrupting her, "charity indeed: why, Mi[s]tre[s]s, charity begins at home, and I have [s]even children at home, bone[s]t, lawful children, and it is my duty to keep them; and do you think I will give away my property to a na[s]ty, impudent hu[s][s]ey, to maintain her and her ba[s]tard; an I was [s]aying to my hu[s]band the other day what will this world come to; hone[s]t women are nothing now-a-days, while the harlotings are [s]et up for fine ladies, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] look upon us no more nor the dirt they walk upon: but let me tell you, my fine [s]poken Ma'am, I mu[s]t have my money; [s]o [s]eeing as how you can't pay it, why you mu[s]t troop, and leave all your fine gimcracks and fal der ralls behind you. I don't a[s]k for no more nor my right, and nobody [s]hall dare for to go for to hinder me of it." "Oh heavens," cried Charlotte, cla[s]ping her hands, "what will become of me?" "Come on ye!" retorted the unfeeling wretch: "why go to the barracks and work for a mor[s]el of bread; wa[s]h and mend the [s]oldiers cloaths, an cook their victuals, and not expect to live in idlene[s]s on hone[s]t people's means. Oh I wi[s]h I could [s]ee the day when all [s]uch cattle were obliged to work hard and eat little: it's only what they de[s]erve." "Father of mercy," cried Charlotte, "I acknowledge thy correction ju[s]t: but prepare me, I be[s]eech thee, for the portion of mi[s]ery thou may'[s]t plea[s]e to lay upon me." "Well," [s]aid the woman, "I [s]hall go an tell my hu[s]band as how you can't pay; and [s]o d'ye [s]ee, Ma'am, get ready to be packing away this very night, for you [s]hould not [s]tay another night in this hou[s]e, though I was [s]ure you would lay in the [s]treet." Charlotte bowed her head in [s]ilence; but the anguish of her heart was too great to permit her to articulate a [s]ingle word. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] And what is friend[s]hip but a name, A charm that lulls to [s]leep, A [s]hade that follows wealth and fame, But leaves the wretch to weep. When Charlotte was left to her[s]elf, [s]he began to think what cour[s]e [s]he mu[s]t take, or to whom [s]he could apply, to prevent her peri[s]hing for want, or perhaps that very night falling a victim to the inclemency of the [s]ea[s]on. After many perplexed thoughts, [s]he at la[s]t determined to [s]et out for New-York, and enquire out Mrs. Crayton, from whom [s]he had no doubt but [s]he [s]hould obtain immediate relief as [s]oon as her di[s]tre[s]s was made known; [s]he had no [s]ooner formed this re[s]olution than [s]he re[s]olved immediately to put it in execution: [s]he therefore wrote the following little billet to Mrs. Crayton, thinking if [s]he [s]hould have company with her it would be better to [s]end it in than to request to [s]ee her. -  To Mrs. Crayton " Madam , "When we left our native land, that dear happy land which now contains all that is dear to the wretched Charlotte, our pro[s]pects were the [s]ame; we both, pardon me, Madam, if I [s]ay, we both too ea[s]ily followed the impul[s]e of our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] treacherous hearts, and tru[s]ted our happine[s]s on a tempestuous ocean, where mine has been wrecked and lo[s]t for ever; you have been more fortunate---you are united to a man of honour and humanity, united by the mo[s]t [s]acred ties, re[s]pected, e[s]teemed, and admired, and [s]urrounded by innumerable ble[s][s]ings of which I am bereaved, enjoying tho[s]e plea[s]ures which have fled my bo[s]om never to return; alas! [s]orrow and deep regret have taken their place. Behold me, Madam, a poor for[s]aken wanderer, who has not where to lay her weary head, wherewith to [s]upply the wants of nature, or to [s]hield her from the inclemency of the weather. To you I [s]ue, to you I look for pity and relief. I a[s]k not to be received as an intimate or an equal; only for charity's [s]weet [s]ake receive me into your ho[s]pitable man[s]ion, allot me the meane[s]t apartment in it, and let me breath out my [s]oul in prayers for your happine[s]s; I cannot, I feel I cannot long bear up under the accumulated woes that pour in upon me; but oh! my dear Madam, for the love of heaven [s]uffer me not to expire in the [s]treet; and when I am at peace, as [s]oon I [s]hall be, extend your compa[s][s]ion to my helple[s]s offspring, [s]hould it plea[s]e heaven that it [s]hould [s]urvive its unhappy mother. A gleam of joy breaks in on my benighted [s]oul while I reflect that you cannot, will not refu[s]e your protection to the heart-broken " Charlotte ." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] When Charlotte had fini[s]hed this letter, late as it was in the afternoon, and though the [s]now began to fall very fa[s]t, [s]he tied up a few nece[s][s]aries which [s]he had prepared again[s]t her expected confinement, and terrified le[s]t [s]he [s]hould be again expo[s]ed to the in[s]ults of her barbarous landlady, more dreadful to her wounded [s]pirit than either [s]torm or darkne[s]s, [s]he [s]et forward for New-York. It may be a[s]ked by tho[s]e, who, in a work of this kind, love to cavil at every trifling omi[s][s]ion, whether Charlotte did not po[s][s]e[s]s any valuable of which [s]he could have di[s]po[s]ed, and by that means have [s]upported her[s]elf till Mrs. Beauchamp's return, when [s]he would have been certain of receiving every tender attention which compa[s][s]ion and friendship could dictate: but let me entreat the[s]e wi[s]e, penetrating gentlemen to reflect, that when Charlotte left England, it was in [s]uch ha[s]te that there was no time to purcha[s]e any thing more than what was wanted for immediate u[s]e on the voyage, and after her arrival at New-York, Montraville's affection [s]oon began to decline, [s]o that her whole wardrobe con[s]i[s]ted of only nece[s][s]aries, and as to baubles, with which fond lovers often load their mi[s]tre[s][s]es, [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed not one, except a plain gold locket of [s]mall value, which contained a lock of her mother's hair, and which the greate[s]t extremity of want could not have forced her to part with. I hope, Sir, your prejudices are now removed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] in regard to the probability of my [s]tory? Oh they are. Well then, with your leave, I will proceed. The di[s]tance from the hou[s]e which our [s]uffering heroine occupied, to New-York, was not very great, yet the [s]now fell [s]o fa[s]t, and the cold [s]o intense, that, being unable from her [s]ituation to walk quick, [s]he found her[s]elf almo[s]t [s]inking with cold and fatigue before [s]he reached the town, her garments, which were merely [s]uitable to the summer [s]ea[s]on, being an undre[s]s robe of plain white mu[s]lin, were wet through, and a thin black cloak and bonnet, very improper habiliments for [s]uch a climate, but poorly defended her from the cold. In this [s]ituation [s]he reached the city, and enquired of a foot [s]oldier whom [s]he met, the way to Colonel Crayton's. "Ble[s]s you, my [s]weet lady," [s]aid the [s]oldier with a voice and look of compa[s][s]ion, "I will [s]hew you the way with all my heart; but if you are going to make a petition to Madam Crayton it is all to no purpo[s]e I a[s][s]ure you: if you plea[s]e I will conduct you to Mr. Franklin's; though Mi[s]s Julia is married and gone now, yet the old gentleman is very good." "Julia Franklin," [s]aid Charlotte; "is [s]he not married to Montraville?" "Yes," replied the [s]oldier,"and may God ble[s]s them, for a better officer never lived, he is [s]o good to us all; and as to Mi[s]s Julia, all the poor folk almo[s]t wor[s]hipped her." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] "Gracious heaven," cried Charlotte, "is Montraville then unju[s]t to none but me." The [s]oldier now [s]hewed her Colonel Crayton's door, and with a beating heart, [s]he knocked for admission. SUBJECT CONTINUED. When the door was opened, Charlotte, in a voice rendered [s]carcely articulate, through cold and the extreme agitation of her mind, demanded whether Mrs. Crayton was at home. The [s]ervant he[s]itated: he knew that his lady was engaged at a game of picquet with her dear Corydon, nor could he think [s]he would like to be di[s]turbed by a per[s]on who[s]e appearance [s]poke her of [s]o little con[s]equence as Charlotte; yet there was [s]omething in her countenance that rather intere[s]ted him in her favour, and he [s]aid his lady was engaged, but if [s]he had any particular me[s][s]age he would deliver it. "Take up this letter," [s]aid Charlotte: "tell her the unhappy writer of it waits in her hall for an an[s]wer." The tremulous accent, the tearful eye, mu[s]t have moved any heart not compo[s]ed of adamant. The man took the letter from the poor [s]uppliant, and ha[s]tily a[s]cended the [s]tair ca[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] "A letter, Madam," [s]aid he, pre[s]enting it to his lady: "an immediate an[s]wer is required." Mrs. Crayton glanced her eye carele[s]sly over the contents. "What [s]tuff is this;" cried [s]he haughtily; "have not I told you a thou[s]and times that I will not be plagued with beggars, and petitions from people one knows nothing about? Go tell the woman I can't do any thing in it. I'm [s]orry, but one can't relieve every body." The [s]ervant bowed, and heavily returned with this chilling me[s][s]age to Charlotte. "Surely," [s]aid [s]he, "Mrs. Crayton has not read my letter. Go, my good friend, pray go back to her; tell her it is Charlotte Temple who reque[s]t beneath her ho[s]pitable roof to find [s]helter from the inclemency of the [s]ea[s]on." "Prithee, don't plague me, man," cried Mrs. Crayton impatiently, as the [s]ervant advanced something in behalf of the unhappy girl. I tell you I don't know her." "Not know me," cried Charlotte, ru[s]hing into the room, (for [s]he had followed the man up [s]tairs) "not know me, not remember the ruined Charlotte Temple, who, but for you, perhaps might [s]till have been innocent, [s]till have been happy. Oh! La Rue, this is beyond every thing I could have believed po[s][s]ible." "Upon my honour, Mi[s]s," replied the unfeeling woman with the utmo[s]t effrontery, "this is a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] mo[s]t unaccountable addre[s]s: it is beyond my comprehension. John," continued [s]he, turning to the [s]ervant, "the young woman is certainly out of her [s]en[s]es: do pray take her away, [s]he terrifies me to death." "Oh God," cried Charlotte, cla[s]ping her hands in an agony, "this is too much; what will become of me? but I will not leave you; they [s]hall not tear me from you; here on my knees I conjure you to [s]ave me from peri[s]hing in the [s]treets: if you really have forgot me, oh for charity's [s]weet [s]ake this night let me be [s]heltered from the winter's piercing cold." The kneeling figure of Charlotte in her affecting [s]ituation might have moved the heart of a [s]toic to compa[s][s]ion: but Mrs, Crayton remained inflexible. In vain did Charlotte recount the time they had known each other at Chiche[s]ter, in vain mention their being in the [s]ame [s]hip, in vain were the names of Montraville and Belcour mentioned. Mrs. Crayton could only [s]ay [s]he was [s]orry for her imprudence, but could not think of having her own reputation endangered by encouraging a woman of that kind in her own hou[s]e, be[s]ides [s]he did not know what trouble and expen[s]e [s]he might bring upon her hu[s]band by giving [s]helter to a woman in her [s]ituation. "I can at lea[s]t die here," [s]aid Charlotte, "I feel I cannot long [s]urvive this dreadful conflict. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] Father of mercy, here let me fini[s]h my exi[s]tence." Her agonizing [s]en[s]ations overpowered her, and [s]he fell [s]en[s]ele[s]s on the floor. "Take her away," [s]aid Mrs. Crayton, "[s]he will really frighten me into hy[s]terics; take her away I [s]ay this in[s]tant." "And where mu[s]t I take the poor creature?" [s]aid the [s]ervant with a voice and look of compa[s][s]io "Any where," cried [s]he ha[s]tily, only don't let me ever [s]ee her again. I declare [s]he has flurried me [s]o, I [s]han't be my[s]elf again this fortnight." John, a[s][s]i[s]ted by his fellow-[s]ervant, rai[s]ed and carried her down [s]tairs. "Poor [s]oul," [s]aid he, "you [s]hall not lay in the [s]treet this night. I have a bed and a poor little hovel, where my wife and her little ones re[s]t them, but they [s]hall watch to night, and you [s]hall be [s]heltered from danger." They placed her in a chair; and the benevolent man, a[s][s]i[s]ted by one of his comrades, carried her to the place where his wife and children lived. A [s]urgeon was [s]ent for: he bled her, [s]he gave [s]igns of returning life, and before the dawn, gave birth to a female infant. After this event [s]he lay for [s]ome hours in a kind of [s]tupor; and if at any time [s]he [s]poke, it was with a quickne[s]s and incoherence that plainly evinced the total deprivation of her rea[s]on. REASONS WHY AND WHEREFORE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] The reader of [s]en[s]ibility may perhaps be a[s]toni[s]hed to find Mrs. Crayton could [s]o positively deny any knowledge of Charlotte; it is therefore but ju[s]t that her conduct [s]hould in [s]ome mea[s]ure be accounted for. She had ever been fully [s]en[s]ible of the [s]uperiority of Charlotte's [s]en[s]e and virtue; [s]he was con[s]cious that [s]he had never [s]werved from rectitude, had it not been for her bad precepts and wor[s]e example. The[s]e were things as yet unknown to her hu[s]band, and [s]he wi[s]hed not to have that part of her conduct expo[s]ed to him, as [s]he had great rea[s]on to fear [s]he had already lo[s]t con[s]iderable part of that power [s]he once maintained over him. She trembled whil[s]t Charlotte was in the hou[s]e, le[s]t the Colonel [s]hould return; [s]he perfectly well remembered how much he [s]eemed intere[s]ted in her favour whil[s]t on their pa[s][s]age from England, and made no doubt, but, [s]hould he [s]ee her in her pre[s]ent di[s]tre[s]s, he would offer her an a[s]ylum, and protect her to the utmo[s]t of his power. In that ca[s]e [s]he feared the unguarded nature of Charlotte might di[s]cover to the Colonel the part [s]he had taken in the unhappy girl's elopement, and [s]he well knew the contra[s]t between her own and Charlotte's conduct would make the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] former appear in no very re[s]pectable light. Had [s]he reflected properly, [s]he would have afforded the poor girl protection; and by enjoining her [s]ilence, en[s]ured it by acts of repeated kindne[s]s; but vice in general blinds its votaries, and they di[s]cover their real characters to the world when they are mo[s]t [s]tudious to pre[s]erve appearances. Ju[s]t [s]o it happened with Mrs. Crayton: her [s]ervants made no [s]cruple of mentioning the cruel conduct of their lady to a poor di[s]tre[s][s]ed lunatic who claimed her protection; every one joined in reprobating her inhumanity; nay, even Corydon thought [s]he might at lea[s]t have ordered her to be taken care of, but he dare not even hint it to her, for he lived but in her [s]miles, and drew from her lavi[s]h fondne[s]s large [s]ums to [s]upport an extravagance to which the [s]tate of his own finances was very inadequate; it cannot therefore be [s]uppo[s]ed that he wi[s]hed Mrs. Crayton to be very liberal in her bounty to the afflicted [s]uppliant; yet vice had not [s]o entirely [s]eared over his heart, but the sorrows of Charlotte could find a vulnerable part. Charlotte had now been three days with her humane pre[s]ervers, but [s]he was totally in[s]en[s]ible of every thing: [s]he raved ince[s][s]antly for Montraville and her father: [s]he was not con[s]cious of being a mother, nor took the lea[s]t notice of her child, except to a[s]k who[s]e it was, and why it was not carried to its parents. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] "Oh," [s]aid [s]he one day, [s]tarting up on hearing the infant cry, "why, why will you keep that child here; I am [s]ure you would not if you knew how hard it was for a mother to be parted from her infant: it is like tearing the cords of life a[s]under. Oh could you [s]ee the horrid [s]ight which I now behold---there---there [s]tands my dear mother, her poor bo[s]om bleeding at every vein, her gentle, affectionate heart torn in a thou[s]and pieces, and all for the lo[s]s of a ruined, ungrateful child. Save me---[s]ave me---from her frown. I dare not--- indeed I dare not [s]peak to her." Such were the dreadful images that haunted her di[s]tracted mind, and nature was [s]inking fa[s]t under the dreadful malady which medicine had no power to remove. The [s]urgeon who attended her was a humane man; he exerted his utmo[s]t abilities to [s]ave her, but he [s]aw [s]he was in want of many nece[s][s]aries and comforts, which the poverty of her ho[s]pitable ho[s]t rendered him unable to provide: he therefore determined to make her [s]ituation known to [s]ome of the officers' ladies, and endeavour to make a collection for her relief. When he returned home, after making this re[s]olution, he found a me[s][s]age from Mrs. Beauchamp, who had ju[s]t arrived from Rhode-I[s]land, reque[s]ting he would call and [s]ee one of her children, who was very unwell. "I do not know," [s]aid he, as he was ha[s]tening to obey the [s]ummons, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] "I do not know a woman to whom I could apply with more hope of [s]ucce[s]s than Mrs. Beauchamp. I will endeavour to intere[s]t her in this poor girl's behalf; [s]he wants the [s]oothing balm of friendly con[s]olation: we may perhaps [s]ave her; we will try at lea[s]t." "And where is [s]he," cried Mrs. Beauchamp, when he had pre[s]cribed [s]omething for the child, and told his little pathetic tale, "where is [s]he, Sir? we will go to her immediately. Heaven forbid that I [s]hould be deaf to the calls of humanity. Come, we will go this in[s]tant." Then [s]eizing the doctor's arm, they [s]ought the habitation that contained the dying Charlotte. WHICH PEOPLE VOID OF FEELING NEED NOT READ. When Mrs. Beauchamp entered the apartment of the poor [s]ufferer, [s]he [s]tarted back with horror. On a wretched bed, without hangings, and but poorly [s]upplied with covering, lay the emaciated figure of what [s]till retained the semblance of a lovely woman, though [s]ickne[s]s had [s]o altered her features that Mrs. Beauchamp had not the lea[s]t recollection of her per[s]on. In one corner of the room [s]tood a woman wa[s]hing, and, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] shivering over a [s]mall fire, two healthy but half naked children; the infant was a[s]leep be[s]ide its mother, and, on a chair by the bed [s]ide, [s]tood a porrenger and wooden [s]poon, containing a little gruel, and a tea-cup with about two [s]poonfulls of wine in it. Mrs. Beauehamp had never before beheld [s]uch a [s]cene of poverty; [s]he [s]huddered involuntarily, and exclaiming---"heaven pre[s]erve us!" leaned on the back of a chair ready to [s]ink to the earth. The doctor repented having [s]o precipitately brought her into this affecting [s]cene; but there was no time for apologies: Charlotte caught the [s]ound of her voice, and [s]tarting almo[s]t out of bed, exclaimed--- "Angel of peace and mercy, art thou come to deliver me? Oh, I know you are, for whenever you was near me I felt ea[s]ed of half my [s]orrows; but you don't know me, nor can I, with all the recollection I am mi[s]tre[s]s of, remember your name ju[s]t now, but I know that benevolent countenance, and the [s]oftne[s]s of that voice which has [s]o often comforted the wretched Charlotte." Mrs. Beauchamp had, during the time Charlotte was [s]peaking, [s]eated her[s]elf on the bed and taken one of her hands; [s]he looked at her attentively, and at the name of Charlotte [s]he perfectly conceived the whole [s]hocking affair. A faint [s]ickne[s]s came over her. "Gracious heaven," [s]aid [s]he, "is this po[s][s]ible?" and bur[s]ting into tears, [s]he reclined the burning head of Charlotte on her own [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] bo[s]om; and folding her arms about her, wept over her in [s]ilence. "Oh," [s]aid Charlotte "you are very good to weep thus for me: it is a long time [s]ince I [s]hed a tear for my[s]elf: my head and heart are both on fire, but the[s]e tears of your's [s]eem to cool and refre[s]h it. Oh now I remember you [s]aid you would [s]end a letter to my poor father: do you think he ever received it? or perhaps you have brought me an an[s]wer: why don't you [s]peak, Madam? Does he [s]ay I may go home? Well he is very good? I [s]hall [s]oon be ready." She then made an effort to get out of bed; but being prevented, her frenzy again returned, and [s]he raved with the greate[s]t wildne[s]s and incoherence. Mrs. Beauchamp, finding it was impo[s][s]ible for her to be removed, contented her[s]elf with ordering the apartment to be made more comfortable, and procuring a proper nur[s]e for both mother and child? and having learnt the particulars of Charlotte's fruitle[s]s application to Mrs. Crayton from hone[s]t John, [s]he amply rewarded him for his benevolence, and returned home with a heart oppre[s][s]ed with many painful [s]en[s]ations, but yet rendered ea[s]y by the reflexion that [s]he had performed her duty towards a di[s]tre[s][s]ed fellow-creature. Early the next morning [s]he again vi[s]ited Charlotte, and found her tolerably compo[s]ed; [s]he called her by name, thanked her for her goodne[s]s, and when her child was brought to her, pre[s][s]ed it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] in her arms, wept over it, and called it the offspring of di[s]obedience. Mrs. Beauchamp was delighted to [s]ee her [s]o much amended, and began to hope [s]he might recover, and, [s]pite of her former errors, become an u[s]eful and re[s]pectable member of [s]ociety; but the arrival of the doctor put an end to the[s]e delu[s]ive hopes: he [s]aid nature was making her la[s]t effort, and a few hours would mo[s]t probably con[s]ign the unhappy girl to her kindred du[s]t. Being a[s]ked how [s]he found her[s]elf, [s]he replied--- "Why better, much better, doctor. I hope now I have but little more to [s]uffer. I had la[s]t night a few hours [s]leep, and when I awoke recovered the full power of recollection. I am quite [s]en[s]ible of my weakne[s]s; I feel I have but little longer to combat with the [s]hafts of affliction. I have an humble confidence in the mercy of him who died to [s]ave the world, and tru[s]t that my [s]ufferings in this [s]tate of mortality, joined to my unfeigned repentance, through his mercy, have blotted my offences from the [s]ight of my offended maker. I have but one care---my poor infant! Father of mercy," continued [s]he, rai[s]ing her eyes, "of thy infinite goodne[s]s, grant that the [s]ins of the parent be not vi[s]ited on the unoffending child. May tho[s]e who taught me to de[s]pi[s]e thy laws be forgiven; lay not my offences to their charge, I be[s]eech thee; and oh! [s]hower the choice[s]t of thy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] ble[s][s]ings on tho[s]e who[s]e pity has [s]oothed the afflicted heart, and made ea[s]y even the bed of pain and [s]ickne[s]s." She was exhau[s]ted by this fervent addre[s]s to the throne of mercy, and though her lips [s]till moved her voice became inarticulate: [s]he lay for [s]ome time as it were in a do[s]e, and then recovering, faintly pre[s][s]ed Mrs. Beauchamp's hand, and requested that a clergyman might be [s]ent for. On his arrival [s]he joined fervently in the pious office, frequently mentioning her ingratitude to her parents as what lay mo[s]t heavy at her heart. When [s]he had performed the la[s]t [s]olemn duty, and was preparing to lie down, a little bu[s]tle on the out[s]ide door occa[s]ioned Mrs. Beauchamp to open it, and enquire the cau[s]e. A man in appearance about forty, pre[s]ented him[s]elf, and a[s]ked for Mrs. Beauchamp. "That is my name, Sir," [s]aid [s]he. "Oh then, my dear Madam," cried he, tell "me where I may find my poor, ruined, but repentant child." Mrs. Beauchamp was [s]urpri[s]ed and affected; [s]he knew not what to [s]ay; [s]he fore[s]aw the agony this interview would occa[s]ion Mr. Temple, who had ju[s]t arrived in [s]earch of his Charlotte, and yet was [s]en[s]ible that the pardon and ble[s][s]ing of her father would [s]often even the agonies of death to the daughter. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] She he[s]itated. "Tell me, Madam," cried he wildly, "tell me, I be[s]eech thee, does [s]he live? [s]hall I [s]ee my darling once again? Perhaps [s]he is in this hou[s]e. Lead, lead me to her, that I may ble[s]s her, and then lie down and die." The ardent manner in which he uttered the[s]e words occa[s]ioned him to rai[s]e his voice. It caught the ear of Charlotte: [s]he knew the beloved [s]ound: and uttering a lond [s]hriek, [s]he [s]prang forward as Mr. Temple entered the room. "My adored father." "My long lo[s]t child." Nature could support no more, and they both [s]unk lifele[s]s into the arms of the attendants. Charlotte was again put into bed, and a few moments re[s]tored Mr. Temple: but to de[s]cribe the agony of his [s]ufferings is pa[s]t the power of any one, who, though they may readily conceive, cannot delineate the dreadful [s]cene. Every eye gave te[s]timony of what each heart felt---but all were [s]ilent. When Charlotte recovered, [s]he found her[s]elf [s]upported in her father's arms. She ca[s]t on him a mo[s]t expre[s][s]ive look, but was unable to [s]peak. A reviving cordial was admini[s]tered. She then a[s]ked, in a low voice, for her child: it was brought to her: [s]he put it in her father's arms. "Protect her," [s]aid [s]he, "and ble[s]s your dying---" Unable to fini[s]h the [s]entence, [s]he [s]unk back on her pillow: her countenance was [s]erenely compo[s]ed; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] [s]he regarded her father as he pre[s][s]ed the infant to his brea[s]t with a [s]teadfa[s]t look; a [s]udden beam of joy pa[s][s]ed acro[s]s her languid features, [s]he rai[s]ed her eyes to heaven---and then clo[s]ed them for ever. RETRIBUTION. In the mean time Montraville having received orders to return to New-York, arrived, and having [s]till [s]ome remains of compa[s][s]ionate tenderness for the woman whom he regarded as brought to [s]hame by him[s]elf, he went out in [s]earch of Belcour, to enquire whether [s]he was [s]afe, and whether the child lived. He found him immer[s]ed in dissipation, and could gain no other intelligence than that Charlotte had le[s]t him, and that he knew not what was become of her. "I cannot believe it po[s][s]ible" [s]aid Montraville, "that a mind once [s]o pure as Charlotte Temple's, [s]hould [s]o [s]uddenly become the man[s]ion of vice. Beware, Belcour," continued he, "beware if you have dared to behave either unju[s]t or di[s]honourably to that poor girl, your life [s]hall pay the forfeit:---I will revenge her cau[s]e." He immediately went into the country, to the hou[s]e where he had left Charlotte. It was desolate. After much enquiry he at length found the [s]ervant girl who had lived with her. From her he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] learnt the mi[s]ery Charlotte had endured from the complicated evils of illne[s]s, poverty and a broken heart, and that [s]he had [s]et out on [s]oot for New-York, on a cold winter's evening; but [s]he could inform him no further. Tortured almo[s]t to madne[s]s by this [s]hocking account, he returned to the city but, before he reached it, the evening was drawing to a clo[s]e. In entering the town he was obliged to pa[s]s [s]everal little huts, the re[s]idence of poor women who supported them[s]elves by wa[s]hing the cloaths of the officers and [s]oldiers. It was nearly dark: he heard from a neighbouring [s]teeple a [s]olemn toll that [s]eemed to [s]ay [s]ome poor mortal was going to their la[s]t man[s]ion; the [s]ound [s]truck on the heart of Montraville, and he involuntarily [s]topped, when, from one of the hou[s]es he [s]aw the appearance of a funeral. Almo[s]t unknowing what he did, he followed at a [s]mall di[s]tance; and as they let the coffin into the grave, he enquired of a [s]oldier who [s]tood by, and had ju[s]t bru[s]hed off a tear that did honour to his heart, who it was that was ju[s]t buried. "An plea[s]e your honour," [s]aid the man, " 'tis a poor girl that was brought from her friends by a cruel man, who left her when [s]he was big with child and married another." Montraville [s]tood motionle[s]s, and the man proceeded--- "I met her my[s]elf not a fortnight [s]ince one night ll wet and cold in the [s]treet; [s]he went to Madam [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] Crayton's, but [s]he would not take her in, and [s]o the poor thing went raving mad." Montraville could bear no more; he [s]truck his hands again[s]t his forehead with violence; and exclaiming "poor murdered Charlotte!" ran with precipitation towards the place where they were heaping the earth on her remains. "Hold, hold, one moment," [s]aid he. "Clo[s]e not the grave of the injured Charlotte Temple till I have taken vengeance on her murderer." "Ra[s]h young man," [s]aid Mr. Temple," who "art thou that thus di[s]turbe[s]t the la[s]t mournful rites of the dead, and rudely breake[s]t in upon the grief of an afflicted father." "If thou art the father of Charlotte Temple," [s]aid he, gazing at him with mingled horror and amazement---"if thou art her father---I am Montraville." Then falling on his knees, he continued--- "Here is my bo[s]om. I bare it to receive the [s]troke I merit. Strike---[s]trike now, and [s]ave me from the mi[s]ery of reflection." "Alas!" [s]aid Mr. Temple," if thou wert the [s]educer of my child, thy own reflections be thy punishment. I wre[s]t not the power from the hand of omnipotence. Look on that little heap of earth, there ha[s]t thou buried the only joy of a fond father. Look at it often; and may thy heart feel [s]uch true [s]orrow as [s]hall merit the mercy of heaven." He turned from him; and Montraville [s]tarting up from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] the ground, where he had thrown him[s]elf, and at that in[s]tant remembering the perfidy of Belcour, flew like lightning to his lodgings. Belcour was intoxicated; Montraville impetuous: they fought, and the [s]word of the latter entered the heart of his adver[s]ary. He fell, and expired almo[s]t in[s]tantly. Montraville had received a [s]light wound; and overcome with the agitation of his mind and lo[s]s of blood, was carried in a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility to his di[s]tracted wife. A dangerous illne[s]s and ob[s]tinate delirium en[s]ued, during which he raved ince[s][s]antly for Charlotte: but a [s]trong con[s]titution, and the tender a[s][s]iduities of Julia, in time overcome the di[s]order. He recovered but to the end of his life was [s]ubject to [s]evere fits of melancholy, and while he remained at New-York frequently retired to the church-yard, where he would weep over the grave, and regret the untimely fate of the lovely Charlotte Temple. CONCLUSION. Shortly after the interment of his daughter, Mr. Temple, with his dear little charge and her nur[s]e, [s]et forward for England. It would be impossible to do ju[s]tice to the meeting [s]cene between him, his Lucy, and her aged father. Every heart [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] of [s]en[s]ibility can ea[s]ily conceive their feelings. After the fir[s]t tumult of grief was [s]ub[s]ided, Mrs. Temple gave up the chief of her time to her grandchild, and as [s]he grew up and improved, began to almo[s]t fancy [s]he again po[s][s]e[s][s]ed her Charlotte. It was about ten years after the[s]e painful events, that Mr. and Mrs. Temple, having buried their father, were obliged to come to London on particular bu[s]ine[s]s, and brought the little Lucy with them. They had been walking one evening, when on their return they found a poor wretch [s]itting on the [s]teps of the door. She attempted to ri[s]e as they approached, but from extreme weakne[s]s was unable, and after [s]everal fruitle[s]s efforts fell back in a fit. Mr. Temple was not one of tho[s]e men who [s]tand to con[s]ider whether by a[s][s]i[s]ting an object in di[s]tre[s]s they [s]hall not inconvenience them[s]elves, but instigated by the impul[s]e of a noble feeling heart, immediately ordered her to be carried into the hou[s]e, and proper re[s]toratives applied. She [s]oon recovered; and fixing her eyes on Mrs. Temple, cried---" You know not, Madam, what you do; you know not whom you are relieving, or you would cur[s]e me in the bitterne[s]s of your heart. Come not near me, Madam, I [s]hall contaminate you. I am the viper that [s]tung your peace. I am the woman who turned the poor Charlotte out to peri[s]h in the [s]treet. Heaven have mercy! I [s]ee her now," continued [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v2&image=325-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] looking at Lucy; "[s]uch, [s]uch was the fair bud of innocence that my vile arts bla[s]ted ere it was half blown."

He gave her [s]helter that night beneath his ho[s]pitable roof, and the next day got her admi[s][s]ion into an hospital; where having lingered a few weeks, [s]he died, a [s]triking example that vice, however pro[s]perous in the beginning, in the end leads only to mi[s]ery and [s]hame.
