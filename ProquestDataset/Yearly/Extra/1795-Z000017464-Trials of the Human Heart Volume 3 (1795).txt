[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-344.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] This is a charming romantic place, my dear Celia. There is room for [s]olitude and deep reflection. Oak-hall is [s]ituated in a very retired part of the country, and has been the family man[s]ion of the Rook[s]by's from time immemorial. The hou[s]e is antique, and in[s]pires one's mind with the true [s]pirit of the days of chivalry. You cannot think, how often I amu[s]e my[s]elf with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-345.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] surveying its antique battlements, the ma[s][s]y gates, and deep moat, that [s]urround it; and while I gaze with a kind of reverential awe, I fancy, I am perhaps retracing the [s]teps of many a gallant knight and beauteous dame who formerly have been inhabitants of this ancient dwelling. I am a great admirer of every thing, that wears the face of antiquity not that I would, were I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of ever [s]o large a fortune, lay out my money in purcha[s]ing a heap of trumpery, that are really of no intrin[s]ie value, only as the fancy of the virtuo[s]o [s]tamps them with the appellation of excellence, becau[s]e they were made [s]ome hundred years before we were born. I cannot deny, that I like to examine any little piece of antiquity, which tends to [s]hew us the progre[s]s of the arts or manufactures, and when I enjoy the benefit of any thing u[s]eful or convenient I feel a kind of veneration for the genius, who fir[s]t invented it, let it be ever [s]o mean or trifling. May 20 th. Mr. Rook[s]by arrived ye[s]terday and has this morning, not to my [s]urprize, but to my infinite regret, made me an offer of his hand and fortune. It is not, my dear Celia, that I am [s]toic enough to pretend, I have an aver[s]ion to being rai[s]ed from a [s]tate of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-346.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] dependence to be mi[s]tre[s]s of [s]even thou[s]and pounds a year: but I feel, I [s]hall never regard Mr. Rook[s]by with the affection, which, in my opinion, is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary, to make the married [s]tate comfortable, though Mrs. Rook[s]by tells me, that in this I am mi[s]taken, as [s]he was perfectly happy while her hu[s]band lived; and yet [s]he declares [s]he acceded to the union merely in compliance with the de[s]ires of her parents. It may be [s]o, Celia, but I am certain I [s]hould never be happy with a man, whom I regard with indifference. But I will give you an account of a conver[s]ation, I had this morning with this invader of my peace (I mu[s]t call him [s]o, for had it not been for him I [s]hould have felt my[s]elf quite happy in my pre[s]ent situation.) We had ju[s]t fini[s]hed breakfa[s]t, when a [s]ervant informed Mrs. Rook[s]by a poor woman de[s]ired to [s]peak with her. The good old lady is benevolent and humane to all her poor neighbours, and the hone[s]t indu[s]trious when oppre[s][s]ed by misfortune are always [s]ure of meeting a friend in her. I had not been alone with Mr. Rook[s]by before, [s]ince my re[s]idence in the family and to tell you the truth, I would gladly have walked ten miles to have avoided it now. But there was no flying; politene[s]s obliged me to [s]it [s]till; be[s]ides I thought it would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-347.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] look [s]o like being afraid of the man, [s]o childi[s]h to run away as [s]oon as his mother left the room---that I [s]at very compo[s]edly and took up my work, which opportunely was in the room.---We were [s]ilent near ten minutes, when at length he [s]poke. "May I venture to enquire how Mi[s]s Howard likes the [s]ituation of my mother's hou[s]e?" "I think it extremely plea[s]ant, [s]ir. It [s]uits the turn of my mind; I am fond of [s]olitude and [s]hould be quite happy were I certain of never wandering from this delightful [s]pot, to the gay regions of fa[s]hion, folly, and what is in general termed plea[s]ure." "How blind are you to your own merits, my dear Mi[s]s, if you wi[s]h thus to hide in ob[s]curity, beauty and virtue, that would do honour to a court." "You make me [s]mile, Mr. Rook[s]by, how would your gay companions ridicule you could they hear you thus lavi[s]hly complimenting an humble dependant of your mother's." "And let them laugh, my dear Mi[s]s Howard, for did they know as I do the true [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-348.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] value of your worth, they would like me, adore it." "This, my dear Celia, was not to be answered: [s]o I was obliged to be content with remaining [s]ilent and looking like an idiot." While he continued, "I am fully [s]en[s]ible of my own unworthine[s]s in pre[s]uming to become a candidate for Mi[s]s Howard's favour. I know how full of error my [s]hort career of life has been; but I tru[s]t your benevolent [s]pirit will pardon my pa[s]t follies; and could I pre[s]ume to hope you would conde[s]cend to accept my hand and fortune, I am certain by a con[s]tant contemplation of the goodness it would [s]trive to immitate, my heart would [s]oon be an offering worthy of your acceptance." Dear Celia, how extremely embarra[s][s]ing was my [s]ituation? I felt my face glow. I dared not look up: at length I [s]ummoned [s]ufficient courage to [s]peak. "I hardly know, [s]ir, in what manner to reply. If the offer you have ju[s]t made be [s]eriou[s]ly meant." "If it be [s]erious, Mi[s]s Howard, can you [s]uppo[s]e I would trifle on [s]o important a [s]ubject, with any woman, much more with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-349.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] one [s]o truly amiable as your[s]elf. Believe me, my charming girl, there is no event could render me [s]o happy, or convey [s]uch unmixed felicity to the bo[s]om of my mother, as to [s]ee you become a part of a family which may derive honour from, but can confer none by the alliance." "Your polite and generous propo[s]al, [s]ir, demands a candid an[s]wer. I feel my[s]elf infinitely obliged by the regard with which you are plea[s]ed to honour me; at the [s]ame time I am under the nece[s][s]ity of declining your offer. I hope you will believe I am not ungrateful for the e[s]teem and friend[s]hip I have fortunately met with in your mother's family, and permit me to add, I [s]hall always regard her as an affectionate parent and you as a brother: but as to any nearer tie, it never can take place between us." "Never, Mi[s]s Howard. Do not [s]ay never--- Time and con[s]tant a[s][s]iduity will I hope influence your heart in my favour: for without that [s]weet hope I mu[s]t be miserable." "Indeed, Mr. Rook[s]by I cannot flatter you. It is at pre[s]ent my fixed determination, never to alter my condition: but were that not the ca[s]e"--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-350.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] "Your choice would not fall on me. I am [s]atisfied---Some more happy man." "Pardon me, you are in an error. I am indifferent to all the [s]ex." "Then why not allow me to [s]trive to awaken the [s]en[s]ibility of your heart. Believe me your happine[s]s [s]hould be the whole [s]tudy of my life." "Mr. Rook[s]by, I will be explicit. Were I ever [s]o partial to your virtues, I could not overlook one glaring error in your conduct, an error which not only tarni[s]hes your own reputation, but preys upon your mother's peace of mind." "You mean my connection with Clara." "I do." "Will you permit me, Mi[s]s Howard, to enter into a little detail of my conduct through the whole of this unhappy connection. Unhappy! I mu[s]t always call it, not only from the rea[s]ons you have ju[s]t alledged, but becau[s]e I fore[s]ee my want of fortitude has involved an amiable woman in infamy and ruin; for had I repul[s]ed the fir[s]t overtures of the unhappy Clara's pa[s][s]ion, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-351.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] affronted pride would have a[s][s]i[s]ted in combating her attachment, and [s]he might at this moment have been happy in the e[s]teem and love of her hu[s]band and family. I have often wi[s]hed to explain this affair to my mother and engage her friend[s]hip in behalf of Clara, but whenever I attempt to [s]peak, [s]he brands the poor girl with the epithets of artful, vile, enticing [s]iren. Alas, Mi[s]s Howard, the unfortunate Clara's greate[s]t error is, a too tender attachment to me." Ah man! man! [s]aid I mentally, how ea[s]ily does thy vanity, dupe thy rea[s]on,--- Mr. Rook[s]by continued--- "It may appear odd, that I [s]hould wi[s]h to enter upon this [s]ubject to you, but I am certain you will judge with candour and repre[s]ent Clara to my mother in [s]uch a light as may lead her to befriend a woman, who has [s]acrificed fame, happine[s]s, and honour to me. You will a[s]k, perhaps, why I do not marry her, as her hu[s]band is lately dead, I would an[s]wer, that [s]he is not a woman calculated to make me happy. Her temper is impetuous, and though her form is lovely and [s]he has received a poli[s]hed education, [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]es not that true femenine [s]oftne[s]s and delicacy which in my opinion alone can render a woman really amiable. My [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-352.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] acquaintance with her commenced about four years [s]ince, while I was completing my studies at Oxford. At that time her hu[s]band Mr. Millar was a coun[s]ellor re[s]iding at that city. He invited me frequently to his hou[s]e. I [s]aw Mrs. Millar, and admired her as a lovely accompli[s]hed woman; nay more, I pitied her, for I [s]aw [s]he was not happy. Her [s]i[s]ter, Mi[s]s Ram[s]ay, who re[s]ided in the hou[s]e with her, told me, their father had been a lieutenant in the navy: but age and infirmities obliging him to retire upon his half pay, they found their circum[s]tances greatly [s]traitened. At this time, Mr. Millar paid their father a vi[s]it. He was [s]truck with the beauty and innocence of Clara, and though at that time near fifty years old, he had the vanity to think he could render him[s]elf agreeable to a girl of [s]eventeen." "Perhaps," [s]aid I, "it was a benevolent wi[s]h to lighten the expences of his friend and place the young lady in a [s]tate of independence which urged him to make the offer of his hand." It might be [s]o, [s]he replied, but whatever his motives might be, gratitude and filial love incited Clara to accept the offer, and [s]acrifice her[s]elf to the man [s]he di[s]liked; to [s]ecure ea[s]e and affluence to her father [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-353.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] and [s]i[s]ter: but he lived not long to enjoy the fruits of her kindne[s]s. A [s]low decline carried him off about a year after his daughter's marriage. At this time I was introduced into Mr. Millar's family. Clara was ju[s]t become a mother; her hu[s]band [s]eemed to idolize her; [s]he could not breathe a wi[s]h which was not in[s]tantly gratified. Yet [s]he was far from happy, and I often [s]aw her turn a[s]ide to conceal tears, which [s]eemed to flow from an oppre[s][s]ed heart. One afternoon, Mr. Millar was from home, her [s]i[s]ter [s]itting at the other end of the room reading. Clara ro[s]e from her [s]eat on pretence of reaching [s]omething from the chimney piece, and [s]tooping, picked up a paper which [s]he presented to me, [s]aying, you drop your letters about very carele[s]sly. I took the paper and perceived it was a [s]ealed letter. I will not [s]hock your delicacy, Mi[s]s Howard, by repeating the contents of this letter. I can perceive by your countenance, that you think it a [s]ufficient error for a married woman to entertain an inclination for any other man than her hu[s]band without daring to avow her pa[s][s]ion. I am [s]en[s]ible, Clara acted with imprudence; but who can an[s]wer for the emotions of a heart, under the influence of its fir[s]t tender attachment? And however culpable, [s]he might be, I think my[s]elf more [s]o. I [s]hould have never more entered Mr. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-354.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] Millar's hou[s]e, when I found how detrimental my pre[s]ence was, both to his honour and happine[s]s. I [s]hould have avoided the society of the fair [s]educer, and confined myself more than ever to my [s]tudies. I am con[s]cious this [s]hould have been my conduct; but, alas! it was quite the rever[s]e. I [s]ought every opportunity of being in her company. I encouraged her growing tenderne[s]s. Private enterviews en[s]ued, and honour, gratitude, and friend[s]hip were all forgotten. Though our entercour[s]e continued, during the whole time I remained at Oxford, Mr. Millar never [s]u[s]pected his injuries. The [s]i[s]ter was in our confidence, and [s]he always contrived our meetings in [s]uch a manner, that they appeared the effect of chance. Ju[s]t before I left Oxford, Clara was confined with her [s]econd child. This prevented my taking a per[s]onal leave. I wrote, informing her of the nece[s][s]ity of my removal, a[s][s]ured her of my grateful affection and that I would take frequent opportunities of visiting her in future. This I [s]aid, merely to quiet her anxiety; for rea[s]on had began to operate; the mi[s]t of pa[s][s]ion was di[s][s]ipated and I was determined to put an end to a connection, at once [s]o di[s]honourable and unju[s]t. I cho[s]e to take the opportunity of her consinement for my departure, as I knew how ill I could [s]upport taking a per[s]onal leave, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-355.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] where tears, faintings, and hy[s]terics would effectually unbend my be[s]t re[s]olutions. I therefore entru[s]ted my letter to the [s]i[s]ter, without-informing her of the contents, and [s]et forward immediately for London. I had not been in town above a fortnight, when one morning, as I [s]at at breakfa[s]t, I heard a chai[s]e [s]top at the door, and in a moment Clara ru[s]hed into the parlour where I was [s]itting. Good God," [s]aid I, "Mrs. Millar what has brought you to town."---"What," [s]he replied, "what but your cruel defertion of me. Unkind, ungenerous Rook[s]by, did you think I would live [s]eparated from you."--- "My dear Clara,,' [s]aid I, "con[s]ider how your reputation will [s]uffer when this ra[s]h [s]tep is known"---"What is reputation to me," cried [s]he, "if I am deprived of your love I lo[s]e all that can make life valuable."--- "Where are your children, Clara,"--- "I left them too, for your [s]ake, Rook[s]by; and is this cold, unkind reception all the return I am likely to meet."---"You call me cold, and unkind; but believe me, you wrong me, I feel all, nay much more than I ought for you, but I am very [s]orry to find you have [s]o little regard for your[s]elf as thus to incur the cen[s]ure of the world by following a man who has it not in his power to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-356.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] offer you an honorable protection."---"You throw me from you, then. You will not receive me" (cried [s]he, [s]tarting up, and wildly cla[s]ping her hands,) Oh Rook[s]by this is more than I can bear---I am bur[s]ting--- My heart is [s]wollen [s]o large; it choaks me.--- "Be calm, I be[s]eech you, my dear Clara, I do not refu[s]e to receive you; no, my poor girl, I feel my[s]elf bound to protect you; for I know it was I fir[s]t drew you from your duty; but I am [s]en[s]ible, how little recompence it is in my power to make for the many comforts and ble[s][s]ings I have robbed you of." "Oh Rook[s]by," [s]aid [s]he, "let me enjoy your [s]ociety, and be ble[s][s]ed with your love, and I [s]hall not regret any [s]acrifice I have made." What could I do, Mi[s]s Howard, continued Mr. Rook[s]by.---There was but one way. I offered to take her a hou[s]e a little way out of town and vi[s]it her occa[s]ionally. She acceded to the propo[s]al and changed her name. Soon after her [s]i[s]ter came to town, and with her brought the two children, whom [s]he [s]aid Mr. Millar had in his re[s]entment turned out of doors.---I now con[s]idered myself as bound to provide for the[s]e unfortunate children; but I had no idea of making myself a re[s]ident in the [s]ame hou[s]e with their mother. But when I went over to France [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-357.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] this la[s]t autumn, [s]he followed me, and with [s]uch earne[s]tne[s]s declared [s]he would [s]ooner die than be [s]eparated from me for one week, that I was unable to refu[s]e the reque[s]t [s]he made to accompany me abroad. While we were on the continent we heard from her [s]i[s]ter, that Mr. Millar was dead.---From that time, Clara earne[s]tly pre[s][s]ed me to marry her; but I told her not to form any [s]uch vain expectation, as that was an event, which never could take place; however I promi[s]ed always to be her friend, and in con[s]ideration of her then evident pregnancy, con[s]ented that on our return to England, I would take a hou[s]e in London and re[s]ide with her.--- Alas! my dear young lady, I knew not what inconveniencies I was bringing upon my[s]elf:--- Her expences far outran the annual [s]um I had allotted her; [s]he is never happy but when I am with her, and even when I devote almo[s]t my whole time to her, [s]he is peevi[s]h, di[s][s]atisfied and con[s]tantly complaining of my altered carriage towards her. Alas, I know I am changed; but I am al[s]o certain I never failed in tender [s]olicitude, and attention to her welfare. I never did love her. Vanity, gratitude, and the wild impul[s]es of youth have been mi[s]taken for that pa[s][s]ion. I am now convinced of my error. My heart now vibrates with a true and ardent affection. I will never [s]uffer Clara to know want; but the future [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-358.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] happine[s]s or mi[s]ery of my life mu[s]t depend entirely upon Mi[s]s Howard. I had li[s]tened attentively, during this recital. I found much to blame in Clara. Indeed, they had both been guilty of errors of [s]uch magnitude, that in my opinion they de[s]erved the appellation of crimes: but it was not for me to condemn. I knew from fatal experience, how imprudent were the dictates of a youthful heart. And though I felt a [s]ecret horror at the recital of Rooksby's cruel perfidy, to his kind, un[s]u[s]pecting friend Mr. Millar, yet he appeared innocent in compari[s]on with Clara. Her hu[s]band loved her almo[s]t to adoration; he had rai[s]ed her from poverty to affluence; he had cheared the la[s]t hours of her father, and offered an a[s][s]ylum to her orphan [s]i[s]ter. He was the father of her children, Celia. Yet could [s]he ungratefully betray the honour he had confided to her care; for[s]ake this kind, indulgent hu[s]band, de[s]ert her innocent children, in that helple[s]s [s]tate, when they require all a mother's fond [s]olicitude and anxious maternal care.---And for this inhuman conduct [s]he pleads love. Celia! real love never yet incited its votaries to ba[s]e or dishonourable actions. I am certain, I never could like Clara. She appears to me an artful de[s]igning woman, and from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-359.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] Rooksby's account, I think, intere[s]t has been the main [s]pring of her actions. Indeed, that alone urged her to follow him; for had [s]he regarded him with real affection, [s]he would have [s]hrunk from the idea of becoming a burthen to him: and do not, my dear Celia, think I am turning rigidly cen[s]orious, if I [s]ay, I [s]u[s]pect [s]he was not really the wife of Mr. Millar; though that takes but little from her guilt, as [s]he certainly had received many tokens of affection from him, and had been received and re[s]pected as his wife by all the families who lived in their neighbourhood. All the[s]e reflections had pa[s][s]ed rapidly thro' my mind, while Mr. Rook[s]by was [s]peaking. When he pau[s]ed, I found my[s]elf nece[s][s]itated to an[s]wer. "You [s]ay, [s]ir, your heart is very deceitful: it has once betrayed you into actions and connections you now heartily repent. May it not do [s]o again. Tru[s]t not to its impul[s]e: call in the aid of rea[s]on and reflection, and you will find your pre[s]ent inclination will prove as great a delu[s]ion as the former." "Impo[s][s]ible!" he replied, vehemently, "impo[s][s]ible, I can never alter my opinion in regard to Mi[s]s Howard." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-360.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] "And believe me, [s]ir," [s]aid I, gravely, "it is equally impo[s][s]ible I can ever alter mine in regard to you." I then attempted to leave the room; but he caught my hand. "Stay, my dear girl, only one moment; let me intreat you, only to recall that cruel word never. Give me but the mo[s]t di[s]tant ray of hope and I will endeavor to be [s]atisfied."---"Well, Sir," [s]aid I [s]miling, "if you remain of the [s]ame opinion you are now, forty years hence, I will talk with you further on the [s]ubject." He relea[s]ed my hand and turned from me in [s]ullen [s]ilence. I embraced the opportunity, and immediately quitted the appartment. But here was a fre[s]h [s]cene of persecution to encounter. Mrs. Rook[s]by met me, as I went acro[s]s the hall, and taking hold of my arm, we walked into the garden. "I [s]ee, my dear Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, "you are not plea[s]ed; poor Clement has little to hope: but come tell me, have you given him a po[s]itive refu[s]al?"---My dear Madam, you already know my [s]entiments on that [s]ubject, I have no inclination for matrimony, I wi[s]h to remain [s]ingle; for I am certain I [s]hould never have patience [s]ufficient to [s]ubmit to all the whims and caprices of tho[s]e lords of the creation. "I am afraid Meriel, you deceive your[s]elf, and that under the idea of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-361.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] a di[s]inclination for marriage, you nouri[s]h a hopele[s]s and de[s]tructive pa[s][s]ion. I know my dear girl how nobly you have conducted your[s]elf in regard to Mr. Kingly. My niece has informed me of the whole: but my good girl, while you are thus [s]tudiou[s]ly promoting the happine[s]s of others, why neglect your own, why [s]acrifice the bloom and [s]pring of life to a pa[s][s]ion, which however well placed, is now no longer innocent." "Oh! Madam," I replied, "do not suspect me of cheri[s]hing [s]o improper a de[s]ire; can I not be [s]uffered to pa[s]s quietly through the remainder of my life, without forming any other connection than friend[s]hip? Why mu[s]t I be obliged to undertake duties I am [s]o very unable to perform? Or why do you wi[s]h a heart long [s]ince dead to plea[s]ure, from whom every tender tie is now [s]evered, to have its [s]en[s]ibility again awakened, to have new affections; to make it again fond of life, only perhaps to experience again the acute pangs of lo[s]ing the beloved objects that had called tho[s]e affections forth?"---"My dear Meriel, you mu[s]t not argue thus; we are all born to encounter trouble."---"Alas! Madam, my [s]hare has already been almo[s]t beyond my weak power to [s]upport; for from the day in which I left the Convent till the pre[s]ent, I have not experienced one [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-362.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] happy that I could wi[s]h it to return, yet heaven knows I do not complain; but I wi[s]h not to engage in new [s]cenes." "You mu[s]t con[s]ider, Mi[s]s Howard, it is not for us to mark out the path we wi[s]h to tread, and cry I will not deviate from it. We are not [s]ent into the world to pa[s]s thro' it in indolence. Remember my love that life which is not in [s]ome mea[s]ure [s]erviceable to our fellow-creatures, is not acceptable to our Creator. You in particular are [s]ent into the world, endowed with abilities to [s]hine in the re[s]pective characters of Wife, Mother, and the mi[s]tre[s]s of a family, and will you be the unprofitable [s]ervant and hide tho[s]e talents intru[s]ted to your care, for the comfort of your friends and the benefit of mankind in general"--- "But Clara, madam. I hope you will allow that is an ob[s]tacle?"---"It is only [s]o in your opinion: To me it is the great motive of my earne[s]t wi[s]h to [s]ee Clement united to you---Clara [s]hall be amply provided for"--- "And her child?"---"We will take it home, [s]hould it be born alive, and I will [s]ee it [s]hall be properly educated and a hand[s]ome provi[s]ion made for its future [s]upport.

"You mu[s]t, dear madam, give me time for con[s]ideration, before I can determine on [s]o important a [s]ubject." "You [s]hall not be hurried, my love, only let me have your leave to bid Clement hope." "Oh! do not I be[s]eech you, rai[s]e fallacious hopes. It may not be in my power to realize them."---"Well then," [s]aid [s]he, "I will remain [s]ilent, till I have your leave to [s]peak." She then turned into another walk and I returned to the hou[s]e.---"And, now my dear Celia, how would you advi[s]e me to act. I fear, turn which way I will, I am [s]till in an error. Ah! my [s]weet friend, I cannot teach this [s]tubborn heart indifference toward Kingly, and [s]ure I am, whil[s]t I remain [s]ingle, my partiality will be ever the [s]ame. Should I marry, other ties and the important duties of my [s]tation will call my mind from this dangerous object: But then to give my hand and vow obedience to a man, whom my heart refu[s]es to love, is certainly an error; and what is wor[s]e, the irrevocable words, once pa[s]t, there will be no flying from my fate, however repugnant it may be to my feelings. I will write to my dear Amelia on the [s]ubject; al[s]o to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-364.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] to Mrs. Kingly. Their opinions [s]hall decide my fate. Yet, my dear Celia, believe me, my [s]oul [s]hrinks from an union with Rook[s]by. I know not why, but whenever I think of it, a cold chill runs through my veins, and my heart [s]inks within me: but I am grown [s]trangely fanciful of late. I am greatly altered [s]ince we parted. Methinks, I am but the [s]hadow of my former [s]elf, the [s]erenity of temper I once boa[s]ted to enjoy is entirely lo[s]t, and I am like a froward child. Adieu, I am changed in every thing but friend[s]hip to you. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Oak-hall June 14 th , 1781.

Amelia wi[s]hes me to accept Mr. Rook[s]by's offer. She [s]ays it is the only way to re[s]tore tranquility to my heart. Mrs. Kingly de[s]ires me to [s]tudy my own happine[s]s, but at the [s]ame time, I think [s]he would rejoice in my union with her cousin.

I [s]hould be plea[s]ed to [s]ee you rai[s]ed to a station you was formed to adorn; but I cannot avoid the remembrance of your gentleness of [s]pirit which [s]eeks not in grandeur for content. Oh! my dear Meriel, I know there never was but one man worthy of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-367.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] your affection, and I have [s]tepped between you and happine[s]s. I informed Mr. Kingly, as you de[s]ired, of my cou[s]in's offer. "Her mind," [s]aid he, "mu[s]t be [s]trangely altered, if [s]he can find the lea[s]t congenial particle in his; but [s]he is altogether an inexplicablee riddle." Vexed to hear him [s]peak [s]o [s]lightingly, I was almost tempted to betray my tru[s]t and tell him how vilely you had [s]landered your[s]elf, but [s]hall I confe[s]s the truth, [s]elf-love prevailed. I could not bear to think he might perhaps be angry at my long concealment; and much as I e[s]teem and venerate my dear Mi[s]s Howard, I could not con[s]ent he [s]hould love even her, better than me. I will not give my opinion concerning your future conduct; though you conde[s]cend to a[s]k it. Of this I am [s]atisfied, whatever your own good [s]en[s]e [s]hall re[s]olve upon, that will undoubtedly be right. Accept my be[s]t wi[s]hes for your happine[s]s and pro[s]perity, and belive you have not a [s]incerer friend than M. KINGLY. MISS SIDNEY to MISS HOWARD. -  London June 3 d , 1781.

I charge you, Mi[s]s Howard, deliberate no longer. Make ha[s]te and [s]end us [s]ome wedding favours, and next winter, let me have the plea[s]ure of pointing out your elegant equipage, as it pa[s][s]es my window, to [s]ome of my inqui[s]itive acquaintance, and [s]aying, "that is my friend Mrs. Rook[s]by's carriage. Then how [s]hall I exult to receive a curte[s]y from a [s]ide box when you are as fine as hands can make you, and poor humble me as plain as po[s][s]ible, [s]it almo[s]t oppo[s]ite you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-369.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] in the pit. In the pit you [s]ay, ble[s]s me Amelia, I [s]hould blu[s]h to death to be thought to know any one in the pit. Pardon me, dear Meriel, I know your good little heart [s]o well, I am certain the friend you esteemed would always be recognized while [s]he continued de[s]erving of your notice, though poverty and di[s]tre[s]s were [s]trongly marked by her appearance. And now to be [s]erious concerning your letter, Mr. Rook[s]by appears to me a weak young man; but there [s]eems great goodne[s]s of heart in him and I think it would be a charitable action to [s]natch him from ruin.---for inevetable ruin mu[s]t follow his connection with Clara. I am informed her [s]tile of living is the mo[s]t extravagant immaginable, and [s]uch splendid preparations are making for her accouchment , that you would think her a dutche[s]s of the fir[s]t rank. And now I am [s]peaking of charitable actions, let me repre[s]ent to my friend the many aching hearts it will be in her power to relieve when [s]he is mi[s]tre[s]s of [s]uch an ample fortune, as Mr. Rook[s]by offers to her acceptance. And again, my love, con[s]ider what a relief it will be to the generous Mrs. Kingly to [s]ee you [s]o well settled. Even Kingly him[s]elf will be happier when you are married, for tru[s]t me while you remain [s]ingle he will nouri[s]h the idea that your partiality for him is the occa[s]ion [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-370.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] of your preferring a [s]tate of celibacy.--- That you will be happier in your[s]elf, I am well convinced. New [s]cenes will open to your imagination, pa[s]t [s]orrows will be forgotten and the afflictions of the daughter [s]hall be amply repaid by the felicity of the mother. Ah! my dear Meriel, you mu[s]t marry, if it be only to experience the superlative happine[s]s of having a daughter, who[s]e [s]oul [s]hall be the exact model of your own. Methinks too, my friend, you will feel your bo[s]om dilate with plea[s]ure, when you can call Mrs. Rook[s]by by the endearing name of mother. A heart like yours, [s]o formed for all the endearing ties of life when deprived of its natural relation, [s]eeks [s]ome one on whom to re[s]t its affection. Accept then my dear girl, the offered good that awaits you, let your heart expand to receive all tho[s]e delightful [s]en[s]ations which re[s]ult from a felicitous matrimonial union, and while you are alternately addre[s][s]ed by the endearing titles of mother and daughter; while the man whom you [s]hall ble[s]s with your hand, reveres, admires, adores you, the di[s]appointments of your youth [s]hall be no more remembered, except it is with a kind of [s]miling wonder at their ever having made you unea[s]y. My mother bids me tell you [s]he wi[s]hes you may be as truly happy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-371.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] as you de[s]erve, and you will then be superlatively [s]o---and [s]o [s]ays your AMELIA SIDNEY. IN CONTINUATION. When I had read the[s]e letters, my mind [s]till wavering and irre[s]olute, I repaired to Mrs. Rook[s]by's dre[s][s]ing room. I found her weeping. "Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, as I entered, "you are come in good time to comfort me. Clement has ju[s]t been with me. He leaves us to-morrow." "To-morrow, Madam, that is much [s]ooner than he at fir[s]t intended." "Yes, Meriel, and he leaves us with an intention that almo[s]t deprives me of rea[s]on." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-372.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] "You [s]urprize me, what intention can he have formed, that gives you [s]o much anxiety." "He is determined to marry Clara immediately on his arrival in London, that his child may be legetimated." "Marry Clara," [s]aid I, with an emotion of a[s]toni[s]hment. "It is even [s]o my dear; he ju[s]t now told me he found it was in vain to hope any thing from you, and being deprived of the hope of your affection he knew love could have no part in any other union, he was determined that the claims of honour [s]hould be attended to, and his innocent child have not future cau[s]e to cur[s]e the author of its being, [s]ince that being would, if he did not marry Clara, inherit infamy as its birth-right." "I cannot think," I replied, "that honour by any means obliges him to marry that woman. She certainly forfeited all claim to an honourable protector, when [s]he fled from Mr. Millar. I wi[s]h [s]he was well provided for, and far from Mr. Rook[s]by, for I am cartain that inevitable mi[s]ery and ruin mu[s]t en[s]ue from a continuation of his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-373.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] present connection with her. What then would bethe con[s]equence of an indi[s][s]oluble union? I tremble to think of it." "You will [s]ee him, Mi[s]s Howard, before he leaves Oak-hall. Let me beg of you, my dear girl, to exert all your eloquence, to per[s]uade him from [s]o fatal a [s]tep. Give [s]ome hope, even if it [s]hould be but fallacious, and I make no doubt, but we [s]hall retain him with us a little time longer, and who knows what time may do." "I cannot deceive any per[s]on, my dear madam. If I am tempted to hold out hope to draw your [s]on from this de[s]tructive resolution, be a[s][s]ured, I [s]hall one day mean to realize them."---"Ble[s][s]ings on you my [s]weet Meriel, you will then relent; I [s]hall have the happine[s]s of [s]eeing my [s]on pre[s]erved from ruin, and obtain a daughter who mu[s]t be admired and e[s]teemed by all, who are [s]o happy as to know her." "I did not ab[s]olutely [s]ay [s]o, madam. I will [s]ee Mr. Rook[s]by previous to his intended departure. I will u[s]e every argument in my power to prevail with him to give up his de[s]ign in regard to Clara; if I find every other argument ineffectual, I will promi[s]e [s]ome future day to give him my hand. But [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-374.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] let me reque[s]t my dear friendly Mrs. Rook[s]by to attribute this re[s]olution to its proper cau[s]e. I will not deceive your [s]on with profe[s][s]ions of affection which I do not feel. I have received many favours from you and your amiable niece Mrs. Kingly, and I think it will be to your mutual [s]atisfaction, to [s]ee me married. I am [s]en[s]ible, it is a duty al[s]o which I owe my[s]elf, as, whil[s]t I continue [s]ingle, I [s]hall always be [s]u[s]pected of nourishing an improper affection for Mr. Kingly, and as it is my earne[s]t wi[s]h to pre[s]erve my own reputation unfullied and to promote as much as po[s][s]ible the happine[s]s of others, I will unite my[s]elf to Mr. Rook[s]by, but alas, I have nothing to offer in return for his generous affection but e[s]teem and friend[s]hip." "Enough my love," cried Mrs. Rook[s]by embracing me, "I have no doubt of Clement's happine[s]s, when ble[s]t with the esteem of [s]o amiable a companion." At dinner we all met as u[s]ual. Mr. Rooksby was in his travelling dre[s]s. "Are you for riding this afternoon, [s]ir," [s]aid I---"I think of [s]etting forward for London, Mi[s]s Howard, I have an affair of infinite con[s]equence to tran[s]act there, and I fear delays may be dangerous."--- "You mu[s]t not leave us to-night, however, Clement," [s]aid his mother [s]miling. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-375.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] \---"I did not under[s]tand you intended leaving Oak-hall till to-morrow," [s]aid I.---"I would willingly [s]tay here for ever," he replied, "but I am [s]en[s]ible my pre[s]ence is detrimental to the tranquility of one who[s]e happine[s]s I would promote at the hazard of my life."--- This was a compliment, my dear Celia, which I could not take entirely to my[s]elf, as he might have meant Clara's happine[s]s was di[s]turbed by his remaining at Oak-hall, I therefore remained [s]ilent, and little more was [s]aid, till the cloth was removed. I then aro[s]e to leave the room with Mrs. Rook[s]by, who generally retires to her dre[s][s]ing room after dinner, and as if often the ca[s]e with elderly people, indulges her[s]elf with a nap. As I aro[s]e Mr. Rook[s]by took my hand. "Permit me, Mi[s]s Howard, before I take my leave to reque[s]t the honour of a few minutes conver[s]ation." I curte[s]ied a[s][s]ent and reassumed my [s]eat; he continued. "It is with infinite regret, my dear young lady, that I leave this place, as by [s]o doing I relinqui[s]h every hope, which I had fondly cheri[s]hed of obtaining an intere[s]t in your bo[s]om. I [s]ee my pre[s]ence is painful to you, it encroaches on that tranquillity you would otherwi[s]e enjoy, in a place [s]o agreeable to your di[s]po[s]ition. I hope you will believe, your happine[s]s is an object of far [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-376.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] greater moment to me than my own. I go from hence with a fixed re[s]olution to repair the injuries I have done Clara; but to convince you how near your intere[s]t is and ever will be to my heart, I mu[s]t beg you will con[s]ider your[s]elf from this moment independent. In this (pre[s]enting me a [s]mall box) you will find a writing, which conveys to you and yours for ever an e[s]tate worth two hundred pounds a year, [s]ituated in Glamorgan[s]hire. I will not be either interrupted or contradicted ([s]eeing I was about to [s]peak.) You mu[s]t accept this as from a brother, who though his own future days will have [s]carce a dawn of plea[s]ure to enliven them, will always have the comfort of reflecting the mo[s]t amiable woman in the world will be no more reduced to situations at once [s]o unworthy her merits, and painful to her feelings." Overcome by this generous conduct I was unable to [s]peak. Tears involuntarily bur[s]t from my eyes and [s]eeing him about to leave the room, almo[s]t unknowing what I did, I caught his hand to detain him.--- "Do not di[s]tre[s]s me, my dear Mi[s]s Howard, [s]aid he, tho[s]e tears are too precious to be [s]hed on [s]uch a trivial occa[s]ion." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-377.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] "Trivial," [s]aid I, "Oh! Mr. Rook[s]by, I cannot accept this noble donation. It oppresses me beyond mea[s]ure. I have no way of di[s]charging the va[s]t debt of gratitude." "My [s]weet girl," [s]aid he, ki[s][s]ing my hand. "Remember me ever with a friendly affection and I [s]hall think my[s]elf a thousand times repaid." "I cannot take it, [s]ir, indeed I cannot. But let me prefer one reque[s]t to you. Do not leave us this afternoon, remain a few days longer to oblige me."--- No, my dear Meriel, I [s]ee the generous drift of your de[s]ign. You pity me, you wi[s]h to make me happy and to oblige my mother would [s]acrifice your own felicity; but, my dear friend, if I have nothing to hope from affection, I will not be indebted to gratitude or compa[s][s]ion. "But, dear Mr. Rook[s]by, con[s]ider how you will di[s]tre[s]s your mother by thus precipitately giving your hand to Mrs. Millar; You mu[s]t pardon me, [s]ir, but indeed I do not think her altogether worthy [s]uch an honour." "Such a [s]evere expre[s][s]ion from mi[s]s Howard is [s]omething extraordinary; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-378.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] women (added he [s]miling) are not always the mo[s]t candid judges of each other. You my dear Mi[s]s behold in Clara only a frail woman, who forgetful of the rigid dictates of honour and virtue [s]acrificed reputation, friends, every valuable con[s]ideration to an unhappy pa[s][s]ion. I behold her as a lovely, unfortunate creature, who has made tho[s]e [s]acrifices for me. I al[s]o con[s]ider that, perhaps, had it been her fate to be united to the man of her heart, [s]he would at this moment have been a re[s]pectable member of [s]ociety; and if I reflect, that I only am the cau[s]e, that [s]he is not [s]o, can I do otherwi[s]e than repair as much, as is in my power, the injuries her reputation has [s]uffered on my account." "I think, Mr. Rook[s]by, you argue perfectly right, nor [s]hould I have entered on this [s]ubject, had it not been at the earne[s]t reque[s]t of your mother. She [s]hudders at the idea of your introducing into the family a woman of light fame. She has been informed that Mrs. Millar is a very faulty woman in more re[s]pects than one. She wi[s]hes to have her amply provided for, but cannot endure to think [s]he mu[s]t be the wife of her darling [s]on." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-379.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] "I [s]aw, Mi[s]s Howard, from the fir[s]t that it was at my mother's de[s]ire you [s]o chearfully a[s][s]ented to this conver[s]ation. She knew the genero[s]ity of your di[s]po[s]ition. She naturally [s]uppo[s]ed you would exert your[s]elf to prevail with me to relinqui[s]h my de[s]ign. She fore[s]aw the generous conce[s][s]ions you would make in my favour: but [s]he knows not the heart of her [s]on, if [s]he imagines affection like his could be [s]atisfied with any thing le[s]s than affection in return." "I am [s]orry, I [s]hall be able to give no better account of my undertaking; but, however, Mr. Rook[s]by, permit me to decline, this obligation (returning the writings). I am perfectly [s]atisfied with my [s]ituation in your mother's family, and mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t on your receiving this again." He refu[s]ed to take it. I laid it on the table and ha[s]tily left the room. So you [s]ee, my dear Celia, while I was con[s]ulting my friends whether I [s]hould accept or reject this man, he has ha[s]tily formed the re[s]olution of leaving me to wear the willow and be[s]towing him[s]elf on another. Seriou[s]ly my friend I feel my[s]elf greatly obliged by the delicate manner in which he declined accepting a hand when he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-380.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] certain the heart would not immediately follow, and were it not that I fear he will be extremely unhappy in an union with Clara, I [s]hould rejoice in being relea[s]ed from his importunities. Mrs. Rook[s]by is in great affliction. I try all I can to comfort her; but I really believe [s]he will feel as much, when [s]he fees her [s]on mount his hor[s]e to leave the Hall, as [s]he would were [s]he attending him to the [s]ilent receptacle of his ance[s]tors. When this dreaded wedding is over [s]he will, I make no doubt, feel ea[s]ier, and the birth of her grandchild will naturally awaken [s]ome degree of affection towards its mother. You will, perhaps, my dear Celia, blame, me for [s]o ob[s]tinately refu[s]ing Mr. Rook[s]by's generous pre[s]ent; but my dear girl I am the wor[s]t in the world to receive an obligation. It oppre[s][s]es me; it [s]inks me to the earth, e[s]pecially when I have no power to return it. While I have my health, I have no doubt of always finding a [s]ituation, where I may render my[s]elf in [s]ome mea[s]ure u[s]eful, in return for my [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, and [s]hould [s]ickne[s]s, age or any infirmity, to which mortality is [s]ubject, overtake me, whil[s]t I remain in what is generally termed an unprotected [s]tate, I have [s]till the [s]ame beneficent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-381.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] Providence to rely on, who never yet suffered me to [s]ink under affliction. Adieu my friend, MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Oak-hall Augu[s]t 12th, 1781. We have had fine bu[s]tling and confusion I a[s][s]ure you, my dear Celia, [s]ince I wrote you la[s]t; and if you knew all, you would [s]ay, we are likely to have much more,---but not to go on with my intelligence too fa[s]t. The morning after I concluded my la[s]t, Mr. Rook[s]by [s]et off for London. His [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-382.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] mother would not take leave of him at his departure, and I was obliged to con[s]ent that a corre[s]pondence [s]hould be commenced between us; for [s]he had ab[s]olutely declared all intercour[s]e with her mu[s]t cea[s]e, from the moment he married Clara. Accordingly on the fourth day after his departure I received a letter, informing me he had arrived too late for his purpo[s]e: for Clara had been in bed two days, and little ma[s]ter was as fine a boy as ever was [s]een, and in perfect health. Mrs. Rook[s]by greatly rejoiced, that any thing had happened to po[s]tpone the wedding, and flattered her[s]elf the connection would by [s]ome means or other be broke off. It was near [s]ix weeks before we had any farther tidings of him, though I had an[s]wered his letter immediately. It was at the clo[s]e of evening; Mrs. Rook[s]by was reclined on a [s]opha; for the weather was extremely hot, and I was playing on the harpsichord which I accompanied with my voice. The evening was remarkably [s]till, the moon with [s]ilver cre[s]cent [s]aintly illumined the [s]ky, encrea[s]ing the beauty of the night by her pre[s]ence, without eclip[s]ing by too much radience the le[s][s]ie[s] glories of the [s]tars. I had ju[s]t begun that charming [s]ong from Milton's Pen[s]ero[s]o. "Sweet bird that [s]hun'[s]t the noi[s]e of folly," [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-383.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] When we were interrupted by the [s]ound of hor[s]es coming up the avenue, and in a few minutes Mr. Rook[s]by ru[s]hed into the room, pale and to all appearance worn out with fatigue. He [s]poke not at entering, but throwing him[s]elf into his mother's arms, bur[s]t into tears. "Clement," [s]aid [s]he, "my dear Clement what is the matter. Good God! you weep, your hands are hot. You are very ill."--- "Oh! mother," he replied, "forgive me. I know it is unlike a man, but the [s]hock I have received."---"Is Clara dead then," [s]aid [s]he.---"Clara, did you [s]ay, Oh the siren, name her not, I cannot tru[s]t my[s]elf to [s]peak of her, [s]he is---but come we will not talk about her." "You come upon us rather unexpected," [s]aid I, advancing towards him. "I came," [s]aid he, "as fa[s]t as a repeated change of hor[s]es would bring me, for I knew there was no other place, where I could find comfort. You, my dear Mi[s]s Howard will comfort me, and you will prevail with my mother, to receive under her protecting roof [s]ome poor little orphans who will arrive to-morrow to claim her care." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-384.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] "You are [s]en[s]ible, Clement, that every child of affliction is welcome to me. I will protect and [s]erve them to the utmo[s]t of my power. How much greater then will be their claim on my humanity, when they come recommended by you." "And when one of them is my child," cried he vehemently,---"my dear mother, that woman, whom I had intended to make my wife---but no matter, [s]he is gone. She has for[s]aken her poor little innocents; but I will not [s]uffer them to know want." "You are not married then?"---"No"--- "Thank heaven, my dear Clement, thank heaven, your honour will not [s]uffer by this cruel defertion, and let the vile mother go, we will protect the unoffending children." After [s]upper, Mr. Rook[s]by was more compo[s]ed. He told us, that on his arrival in London he ha[s]tened to Clara and found her as he had informed us, the mother of a fine boy and likely to do well. He told her with what intention he had hurried to town, and [s]aid, if [s]he de[s]ired it, a [s]pecial licence [s]hould be procured and the ceremony performed in her own chamber. This [s]he fortunately refu[s]ed alledging, that, as her disgrace had been public, [s]he de[s]ired the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-385.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] reparation might be public al[s]o. To this he assented and preparations were making for the public performance of the ceremony. He had pre[s]ented her with a magnificent [s]et of jewels, and with money to the amount of three thou[s]and pounds. A day was appointed for the union: the articles, [s]ettlements, &c. were all ready for [s]igning: When the evening preceding the appointed morning he called at her hou[s]e and was informed [s]he was gone to a private ball [s]ome few miles out of town. He thought it [s]omewhat [s]trange, but knowing the volatility of her di[s]po[s]ition and how extremely fond of every thing that wore the [s]emblance of plea[s]ure, it did not [s]o much [s]urprize him. The next morning he repaired to her at the time appointed, a new equipage, [s]ervants in new liveries with white and [s]ilver favours arrived at the door. The gue[s]ts began to appear when enquiries were made for the bride.--- Mr. Rook[s]by went up to ha[s]ten her. She was not in her dre[s][s]ing-room. He called for her woman: [s]he was not to be found. At length a groom ventured, trembling into the pre[s]ence of the di[s]appointed, enraged bridegroom and delivered him a [s]ealed billet. He broke the [s]eal with precipitation: it contained the[s]e words: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-386.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] - You thought to have deceived me, but you are mi[s]taken. I have been informed of all your late di[s]honourable conduct. Would your mother's humble companion have accepted your hand, it would never have been offered to me: but though you have been a dupe to me I will not become one to you. I know, you will, at the reception of this, rave and cur[s]e your evil genius which has induced you to make your[s]elf the laughing [s]tock of your acquaintance. I am far beyond the reach of your revenge, and enjoy in idea, the ridiculous figure you will, at the moment you are reading this appear, surrounded by your friends decked in the trappings of nuptial finery and de[s]erted by the intended bride. I have left the brats.--- They would have been trouble[s]ome on the long journey I mean to take; you may either provide for them or [s]end them to the work-hou[s]e; either way will be equally agreeable to me. I have accepted the protection of a noble lover, and mean to make with him the tour of Europe. You mu[s]t now offer your[s]elf again to Mi[s]s Howard, and I wi[s]h [s]he may [s]erve you as I have done. CLARA. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-387.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] It is ea[s]y to conceive the pa[s][s]ion this infamous [s]crawl created in the bo[s]om of Rook[s]by. He was in the fir[s]t paroxy[s]ms of rage for putting an immediate period to his exi[s]tence. Shame, vexation, and disappointment drove him to the verge of distraction. At length he recollected the child of whom he is extremely fond. He called for it, declared that the mother's guilt [s]hould never be revenged on her innocent offspring, and in care[s][s]ing the little cherub, in [s]ome mea[s]ure compo[s]ed the perturbation of his [s]pirits. The company di[s]per[s]ed, he [s]ent away his chariot, and returned to his lodging in a hackney-coach, where he undre[s][s]ed and ordering po[s]t hor[s]es, [s]et forward immediately for Oak-hall, leaving his own man to follow with the nur[s]e and children. The elde[s]t, who is a girl, I am told is at [s]chool in a village near Oxford, where Mr. Rook[s]ky has every rea[s]on to be [s]atisfied with the care taken of her education and morals. He means, he [s]ays, that [s]he [s]hall have a u[s]eful education, and will [s]ettle on her a thou[s]and pounds, the intere[s]t of which is to be appropriated to her [s]upport. The two boys, he will bring up together and by a liberal education fit them for one of the genteel profe[s][s]ions, the choice of which [s]hall remain with them[s]elves. To them al[s]o he will give a thou[s]and pounds each; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-388.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] they are both to be called by the name of Millar. This is certainly a noble [s]pirited young man. It is a pity he has not more firmne[s]s of temper; but he is as weak as an infant and as ea[s]ily per[s]uaded by per[s]ons who rightly under[s]tand his di[s]po[s]ition. Awaken his gratitude or make a claim upon his honour, and you may lead him as you plea[s]e. This is far from the kind of temper that I like. Were I ever [s]o much attached to Mr. Rook[s]by, I [s]hould be afraid of profe[s][s]ing it, lea[s]t it [s]hould be [s]uppo[s]ed I meant to take an undue advantage of his ea[s]y nature, and I [s]hould, if married to [s]uch a man, avoid [s]hewing a thou[s]and little kindnesses, lea[s]t I [s]hould [s]eem to demand more than [s]imilar attentions from him. There is another trait in his character, which I have lately di[s]covered. He is vain and rather addicted to jealou[s]y; and I can perceive there is no part of Clara's conduct hurts him more [s]everely, than finding her [s]o totally indifferent--- and when he imagined her strongly attached to him[s]elf, to know her capable of eloping with another. And yet, my dear Celia, this very man with all his errors, they have [s]ome how or other among them drawn me into a [s]ort of promi[s]e to marry. Mrs. Kingly wrote and my dear Amelia wrote too.---Mrs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-389.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] Rook[s]by pleaded, and Clement him[s]elf, looked [s]uch eloquent things, that what with the grateful remembrance of his genero[s]ity, toward me, which I forgot to tell you his mother in[s]i[s]ted on my accepting, and a [s]ort of pity for his late di[s]appointment, I experienced a kind of [s]entiment which I know not how to di[s]tingui[s]h. It is more lively than e[s]teem, and yet I am [s]ure it is not love. However, be it what it may, the die is ca[s]t, and I believe Rook[s]by will be the man with whom I am de[s]tined to pa[s]s my life. The [s]ettlements, &c. prepared for Clara, his mother declares [s]hall remain for me, as blanks had been left for the names. I do not agree to this point; as I think the [s]ettlement by far too large. I think it very nece[s][s]ary a proper provi[s]ion [s]hould be made in ca[s]e of a large family, but as I have no fortune, it would be unju[s]t as well as ungerous to accept a [s]ettlement of [s]even hundred a year. This I am re[s]olved to over rule.--- Three hundred will be more than [s]ufficient. On this condition alone, will I give him my hand, for it [s]hall never be [s]aid the poor Meriel Howard aggrandized her[s]elf at the expence of the Rook[s]by family. For here are ill natured people in all families and no doubt many of Mr. Rook[s]by's relations will think them[s]elves degraded by this alliance. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-390.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] In about a month from this time, my dear friend, my fate will be decided. Contrary to my inclination, the old lady will have a public wedding, and all the family to the third and fourth generation are to be invited. The old man[s]ion is put into [s]uch a commotion: here is [s]uch fitting up and pulling down, with [s]uch wife and bu[s]y faces, popping about from one apartment to another, while I, who am the cau[s]e of all the confusion, am as calm and compo[s]ed as po[s][s]ible. At lea[s]t, my countenance and demeanor [s]ay [s]o; but I have many [s]erious thoughts, and many a tear and many a [s]igh is given to the memory of the time when I looked forward to the nuptial hour with different [s]en[s]ations; but that mu[s]t be forgotten. My dear Celia, pray for for your MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Oak-hall Sept. 20 th , 1781. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-391.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] It is pa[s]t, my friend---and I am now the wife of Mr. Rook[s]by. It is ju[s]t a week, [s]ince at the altar, I pledged my faith to love and honour him to the late[s]t period of his exi[s]tence. Well Celia, I will keep this vow mo[s]t religiou[s]ly; at lea[s]t I will e[s]teem him and love no other, and whil[s]t his conduct is [s]uch as demands honour, I will honour him. Should he ever fail in any of the grand moral duties, I will bear it with meekne[s]s, pity him and endeavour to reclaim him. I will be a faithful wife in every [s]en[s]e of the word. The day on which I gave him my hand, was indeed to me a tremendous one.--- Kingly was pre[s]ent, nay he even gave me to his cou[s]in. I trembled when he took my hand, a [s]aint [s]icki[s]h [s]en[s]ation come over [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-392.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] me: but I rallied my [s]pirits and went through the ceremony tolerably well. My dear Amelia, whom you might [s]uppo[s]e would be present on this important occa[s]ion, kept up my [s]pirits during the re[s]t of the day. Mrs. Kingly looked happy, but it was a kind of [s]atisfaction tempered with fear.---"I hope" [s]aid [s]he," pre[s][s]ing my hand, "I hope the aera of your felicity may be dated from this propitious day."---"Mo[s]t certainly it will," cried Amelia, "for who ever heard of misery in a coach and [s]ix."---"Oh!" replied Mrs. Kingly, with great energy, "there is much greater mi[s]ery in them than tho[s]e who lack the goods of fortune will readily imagine, aye, my dear Mi[s]s Sidney, and the wor[s]t kind of mi[s]ery too, [s]uch as wealth cannot relieve or grandeur alleviate." "Well," [s]aid Amelia, laughing, "I declare we have cho[s]en a brilliant topic for a wedding day, but pray let us change it. I was always more inclined to become a di[s]ciple of the laughing, rather than the weeping philosopher." When it drew near dinner time and I found I mu[s]t de[s]cend into the drawing room, I trembled from the idea of being pre[s]ented to about half a hundred [s]trangers, who would compliment, and critici[s]e at a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-393.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] mo[s]t unmerciful rate; the one to my face, the other behind my back, and believe me I would [s]ooner li[s]ten to the latter than the former: for compliments have in general little or no meaning and of cour[s]e are mere in[s]ipid trifles. Now in li[s]tening to the criticisms of our friendly neighbours, who perhaps did not intend we [s]hould over hear them, we di[s]cover our faults, and may learn how to amend them; but the misfortune is, few will take the trouble to point out our errors to us, while every one is ready to flatter our [s]elf love, by commending us for qualifications to which we have little or no preten[s]ions, and, if they think, we believe their a[s][s]ertions, the moment we quit them they will laugh at our credulity. Well! my dear Celia, I never could bring my[s]elf to make compliments, or fine [s]peeches to people, whom I did not think de[s]erved them. But to return to my [s]ubject--- I got through the day tolerably well, and now our gue[s]ts begin to think of returning to their re[s]pective homes. It is propo[s]ed, that we [s]tay at Oak-hall till the latter end of November. Mrs. Rook[s]by has prevailed on Mrs. Sidney to remain with her, during the winter, while Amelia accompanies me to town. I am va[s]tly plea[s]ed with the arrangement, as the [s]ociety of that dear girl [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-394.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] will be a great comfort to me. I find Rooksby has given orders for a hou[s]e to be fitted up in a [s]tile of the utmo[s]t elegance, as he intends we [s]hall always pa[s]s the winters in town and the [s]ummers with his mother at the Hall. He talks of much grandeur and gaity. I am [s]orry for it, I think his ta[s]te very expen[s]ive; but it is not my place to [s]peak. I am determined to regulate my own expences, by the [s]trict rule of economy, void of par[s]imony. Even was the wealth my own, I have no right to [s]quander it away in unnece[s][s]ary trifles, and as it is not, I mu[s]t be [s]till more careful. My allowance for pocket money, cards, &c. is extremely liberal, and I hope always to order it in [s]uch a manner as to have a [s]ufficient [s]um by me, to a[s][s]i[s]t depre[s][s]ed merit, or re[s]cue [s]uffering innocence from oppre[s][s]ion. I hope, my dear Celia, elevated as my pre[s]ent [s]ituation is, I [s]hall never forget the u[s]eful le[s][s]ons taught me in the [s]chool of adver[s]ity; and [s]urely, whil[s]t the remembrance of my own [s]ufferings are retained, my heart will never be rendered callous to the [s]ufferings of others. Oh! my beloved friend, dearly indeed [s]hould I purchase the [s]miles of fortune, if I am to lo[s]e my humanity. Benificent Ruler of the Univer[s]e, teach me to value the ble[s][s]ings bountifully [s]howered upon me, by constantly remembering my own de[s]erts; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-395.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] whenever I meet an afflicted fellow-creature, let my heart [s]hew its gratitude to Thee, by dropping the tear of [s]ympathy, and granting the tribute of relief."---I am certain, Celia, they who have never known adversity, cannot truly enjoy pro[s]perity. I forgot to tell you, that Kingly left us the day after we were married. Mrs. Kingly [s]tays, till we all go to London. When we are [s]ettled there, I will write you again; but you mu[s]t not expect any great variety in my letters; I mu[s]t, I [s]uppo[s]e, at fir[s]t enter into the gaities of the metropolis, but I am determined not to be [s]o infatuated as to give up my whole time to them. I will have my hours of peace and retirement: for in my opinion the life that is [s]pent in a continued round of in[s]ipid plea[s]ures, is not only entirely u[s]ele[s]s to [s]ociety, but in [s]ome mea[s]ure guilty, as we can have no time for the performance of tho[s]e duties, which are incumbent on every profe[s][s]or of Chri[s]tianity; nor do I think as many do, that people of a certain rank in life may pa[s]s their time in any way mo[s]t agreeable to them[s]elves, and that they are not accountable for it to any one. We certainly are an[s]werable to one, who will demand an account of our [s]teward[s]hip at a time, when no eva[s]ion whatever will [s]erve our turn: and the more elevated our station, the more careful we [s]hould be to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-396.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] [s]et examples worthy the imitation of our inferiors. Examples that may in[s]pire all, who know us with a love of virtue, be an honour to our[s]elves, and a benefit to society in general. Mr. Rook[s]by a[s]ked me, to whom I was writing. To the friend of my early days, I replied. We were educated in the [s]ame convent. Mi[s]s Shelburne cho[s]e to take the veil---I was of a different religion, and have been called into the bu[s]y [s]cenes of life, but the affections of our youth are always remembered with peculiar plea[s]ure; especially, when rea[s]on approves the election our hearts had made in the days of childhood. I am certain, my dear Meriel, [s]aid he, [s]he mu[s]t be amiable, or [s]he would not be honoured with your e[s]teem. You are a flatterer, [s]aid, I [s]miling, but if you knew Celia half [s]o well as I do, you would know [s]he was worthy of the love of every good heart. I will not repeat his reply, my friend, as it would favour too much of vanity, if he is as gallant and tender twelve months hence, I may perhaps, [s]tand a good chance for claiming the flitch of bacon  . He bids me pre[s]ent his be[s]t wishes to you. Amelia al[s]o reque[s]ts to be remembered; but it is impo[s][s]ible that either [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-397.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] of them can love and e[s]teem you with the tenderne[s]s and [s]incerity of MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Dec. 19 th , 1781. I have been in town above a week; but could not command an hour to devote to friend[s]hip and Celia. Indeed, I have been [s]o taken up with mantua-makers, milliners and toymen, I hardly know what account to give of the la[s]t [s]even days; then what with here and there a particular friend, who reque[s]ted to be admitted, before my appearance at court gave the [s]ignal for the whole town to come and pa[s]s their opinion on my hou[s]e-furniture,  &c. I have been wearied to death with a con[s]tant [s]ucce[s][s]ion of impertinant vi[s]itors, who are thus over polite, for no other rea[s]on than the eager desire they have to report the di[s]coveries they make in regard to my per[s]on, dre[s]s and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-398.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] manner, to the whole circle of their acquaintance; but in this they have been [s]adly disappointed, for I have received them all in a [s]mall back drawing-room, and have never yet varied my dre[s]s from a neat di[s]habille. I am now [s]ummoned to the drawing room: [s]ome new [s]et of inqui[s]itives, I suppose, well, I mu[s]t attend; for people of fa[s]hion live not for them[s]elves, but others. They are afraid to perform any action, if unfa[s]hionable, though ever [s]o right, lea[s]t they [s]hould be laughed at: and for the very [s]ame cau[s]e dare not refu[s]e to do any thing to which fa[s]hion gives a [s]anction, though reason tells them it is wrong, and [s]hould be avoided. I mu[s]t leave you Celia. And who do you imagine my vi[s]itors were? Now would I venture to lay a con[s]iderable wager, your mind would glance over the whole circle of my acquaintance, without being able to gue[s]s the right. So to [s]ave you the trouble of conjecture, I will at once inform you. They were no other than my kind aunt Mo[s][s]opand her two amiable daughters. I do declare, Celia, when I [s]aw them in the drawing room I ab[s]olutely blu[s]hed for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-399.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] them. However, they did not [s]eem to experience any embarra[s][s]ment; but paid their compliments with the [s]ame ea[s]y air, as if nothing had ever interrupted our intimacy; only with this difference, their language and manner was more re[s]pectful. "You have been very [s]ly, my dear," [s]aid my aunt, "never to let us know where you were all this time, and then to blaze upon us all at once a [s]plendid bride." "I thought, madam, after the death of my father, you would feel but little interested about the fate of his daughter, for whom you never appeared to have any great degree of partiality." "Ble[s]s me, Mrs. Rook[s]by, you are vastly mi[s]taken. I was always extremely partial to you, and I am [s]ure He[s]ter and Su[s]an have talked of you many times, [s]ince la[s]t we had the plea[s]ure of [s]eeing you. We wondered what had become of you." "I have [s]een a variety of [s]cenes," [s]aid I, "nor would it have been in the lea[s]t probable [s]hould meet with [s]o advantageous a settlement as I have, had it not been for the friend[s]hip of a young lady, whom I have once or twice [s]een at your hou[s]e, and who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-400.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] at pre[s]ent does me the honour to make one of my family." I then rang the bell, and de[s]ired the [s]ervant to inform Mi[s]s Sidney we reque[s]ted the favour of her company. I [s]aw my cou[s]ins look at each other when Amelia's name was mentioned, Mrs. Mo[s][s]op changed countenance. "Ble[s]s me," [s]aid Hester, "I was thinking of Mi[s]s Sidney, the other day: but we have been in town [s]o very little while, we have [s]een nobody---this is positively the fir[s]t vi[s]it we have made." When Amelia entered the room, I [s]aw [s]he was a[s]toni[s]hed: I al[s]o [s]aw the con[s]traint and confu[s]ion which my vi[s]itors vainly endeavoured to hide under the ma[s]k of extreme plea[s]ure at the accidental meeting. However, as I imagined, my cou[s]ins courted my notice merely in the hope of [s]ometimes being of my parties, and throwing themselves in the way of men of rank and fortune, I gave them a general invitation to my hou[s]e, and I [s]incerely wi[s]h the event may an[s]wer their [s]anguine expectations, as it would give me great [s]atisfaction to [s]ee them married to worthy men, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of fortunes capable of [s]upporting them in the manner to which they have been accu[s]tomed, and which I fear they could not continue, was their father to die before they are settled; as he could not leave them a large fortune, having in general lived up to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-401.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] extent of his income. Young Mo[s][s]op is, I find, in the We[s]t-Indies.---Is it not [s]trange, my dear Celia, that I have heard nothing of my brother the[s]e two years pa[s]t. However he has forgot me. I often think of him; I pray for his health and pro[s]perity, and [s]hould rejoice to [s]ee him return with an independence [s]ufficient to place him in a respectable [s]ituation.---Oh Celia, this continual round of vi[s]itors, by no means [s]uits the ta[s]te of your friend. I am called away again. MERIEL. MERIEL to CEILA. -  Oak-hall June 10 th , 1783. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-402.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] My little Clementina, is grown the fine[s]t girl you can imagine; and I a[s][s]ure you, grandmamma is not a little proud of her darling. I wi[s]hed the dear little charmer to have been called Frederica, but I dared not [s]ay [s]o, lea[s]t it [s]hould be thought improper. La[s]t night, my dear Amelia arrived: her [s]pirits are greatly depressed by the death of her excellent mother, but as [s]he will be happy in the friend[s]hip and protection of Mrs. Rook[s]by, I hope [s]oon to [s]ee her chearfulne[s]s re[s]tored. I have got [s]uch a habit of [s]eizing every lei[s]ure moment to [s]cribble to my Celia, that I often [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-403.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] take up my pen, when I have really nothing to [s]ay. You rejoice, you tell me to find my happine[s]s increa[s]e. Indeed, my dear friend I experience a much larger [s]hare than [s]ome years [s]ince, I could have imagined would have ever fallen to my lot. Mr. Rook[s]by is [s]till the kind, the attentive hu[s]band, and the birth of my little girl [s]eems more strongly to cement our union. You cannot think, how [s]urpri[s]ed I was a few days before we left town. Mr. Rooksby had been out in the morning, and on his return told me he had met with an old friend whom he had invited home to dinner." He is a man," [s]aid he, "with whom I formed an acquaintance when we were both boys at the [s]ame [s]chool together, I have not [s]een him for [s]ome time, but I always thought him a worthy fellow, and am now happy in the renewal of our intimacy." He did not mention the name of his friend. You may judge therefore what was my a[s]toni[s]hment, when ju[s]t before dinner a [s]ervant announced Mr. Belger. I know not why it was, but I felt my[s]elf strangely embarra[s][s]ed while he was paying his compliments. Mr. Belger too was [s]urpri[s]ed, and looked aba[s]hed at the unexpected rencounter, for I had not [s]een him [s]ince the cold wet night when we parted at the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-404.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] end of Ken[s]ington. However, I immediately acco[s]ted him by name and turning to Mr. Rook[s]by endeavoured at a [s]mile, while I [s]aid, "This is an old acquaintance of mine too, though I dare [s]ay Mr. Belger had not the mo[s]t di[s]tant idea of [s]eeing me here." I then enquired after Mrs. Belger and Emma. "Emma is abroad in a convent, madam," he replied---"and, her mother"---He hesitated, and I at that moment perceiving he was dre[s][s]ed in [s]econd mourning, in[s]tantly under[s]tood his meaning. I felt my eyes fill. I remembered her gentlene[s]s and affection, and I al[s]o remembered how ill that affection had been requited. "And pray, my dear," [s]aid Mr. Rook[s]by, "where were you acquainted with my friend Belger?"---"At Ken[s]ington," I replied.--- "At Ken[s]ington!" [s]aid he with vi[s]ible emotion "Did you know many per[s]ons there." "Very few, indeed; for at that time I was not in a [s]ituation to receive many vi[s]itants." I did not choo[s]e, my dear Celia, to mention having known Mrs. Moreton; as [s]he was undoubtedly a woman of light character, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-405.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] the being [s]uppo[s]ed, an intimate of [s]uch a woman, would by no means contribute to rai[s]e me in Mr. Rook[s]by's opinion, I therefore endeavoured to give the conver[s]ation a different turn, and dinner being [s]oon after announced, it a[s][s]i[s]ted my de[s]ign, and we [s]poke afterwards only on indifferent [s]ubjects.---I am by no means plea[s]ed with Belger's being on an intimate footing in our family, he is not a proper companion for Rook[s]by, I am certain he is of libertine principles, fond of gaming and di[s][s]ipated in his manners, yet greatly as I di[s]like him, I dare not mention it to Mr. Rook[s]by, as he [s]eems extremely fond of him and places the mo[s]t implicit confidence in his honour, and has actually invited him to pa[s]s [s]ome weeks this [s]ummer with us here, I am mortified and vexed, Amelia laughs at me, when I mention my anxiety and [s]ays, he will now be fearful of in[s]ulting me by any mention of his love. While I was unprotected he could treat me with di[s]re[s]pect, without fear of being called to an account, now it is quite a different affair.---Indeed, Celia, this is not what I dread, but I think if Mr. Rook[s]by [s]hould by any means hear how intimate we once were, he would be di[s]plea[s]ed, and it might be the cau[s]e of great unea[s]ine[s]s between us, I [s]hall take particular care to avoid all opportunities of being entertained alone by this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-406.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] man, and feel happy in the reflection that while I am in the country I [s]hall have Amelia con[s]tantly with me. 22 d . Since I began my letter I have been [s]o agitated and di[s]tre[s][s]ed I found my[s]elf totally unequal to the ta[s]k of fini[s]hing it. Now I have [s]at down for that purpo[s]e, I hardly know how to arrange the extraordinary events that have happened within the[s]e la[s]t twelve days, nor am I certain that you, my dear Celia, will entirely approve of my conduct; yet [s]ure you will not greatly condemn me: for your gentle heart is benevolence it[s]elf. On the evening of the day on which I began my letter, I could not but ob[s]erve that Mr. Rook[s]by was extremely thoughtful and grave, a thing with him very uncommon, as his u[s]ual demeanor is chearful, and his conver[s]ation lively.---Once or twice, I thought (for I ob[s]erved him narrowly,) I [s]aw the tears [s]tart in his eyes, he [s]ighed deeply and often. His mother remarked his want of [s]pirits and inquired if he was well. His an[s]wer was, "yes madam, very well, but rather out of [s]pirits, I [s]hall be better to-morrow, do not pay any attention to it."---I thought it was be[s]t not to [s]peak, lea[s]t urgent inquiries might encrea[s]e rather than relieve [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-407.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] his evident depre[s][s]ion; and in ca[s]e any family affair had occa[s]ioned his unea[s]ine[s]s I was [s]en[s]ible he would not choo[s]e to mention it before his mother and Amelia.---I therefore determined to let it re[s]t, if he thought it right that I [s]hould be informed of the cau[s]e, he would the fir[s]t convenient opportunity communicate it; if not, it would I naturally [s]uppo[s]ed only increa[s]e his vexation to be teized with impertinent inquiries. When we retired he [s]poke but little, [s]eemed buried in thought, and I am certain, [s]lept little all night. This was too much---I felt my heart partake of his unea[s]ine[s]s, though I was ignorant of its origin. I longed to lighten his anxiety by participation;--- Yet, feared to be trouble[s]ome.---After breakfa[s]t perceiving his dejection rather increase than dimini[s]h, I followed him into the [s]hrubbery, and finding him [s]itting in a melancholy, mu[s]ing po[s]ture, [s]eated my[s]elf be[s]ide him, and laying my hand on his arm, [s]aid with a voice, that evidently [s]poke my tender [s]olicitude--- "Rook[s]by you are not happy." "I am not, indeed, my dear Meriel, I am very far from it; but do not let it interrupt your tranquillity. The cau[s]e of my pre[s]ent dejection will [s]oon be removed, and then I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-408.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] [s]hall again enjoy with plea[s]ure the [s]ociety of the be[s]t of wives; but at pre[s]ent, my love, I mu[s]t reque[s]t you to leave me, as I am unfit for conver[s]ation." "And can you, Rook[s]by, think me worthy of the flattering appelation you ju[s]t now gave me, and yet [s]uppo[s]e me capable of pre[s]erving my tranquillity while I [s]ee you unhappy." "You know, my [s]weet girl, I think you all, that is good and amiable in woman, and it is for your peace of mind I would endeavour to hide my unhapine[s]s." "But as you connot hide it from the eye of affection, then refu[s]e me not the pleasure, my dear Rook[s]by of at lea[s]t participating. If I cannot alleviate your anxiety, [s]urely you cannot fear to place a confidence in the cho[s]en friend of your heart." "Oh no! but I know it will give you no plea[s]ure to be informed, nay, I fear it would rather make you unhappy in an eminent degree." "Then it is [s]omething of great consequence either to your honour or intere[s]t, or perhaps to both: if [s]o, I mu[s]t one day [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-409.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] know it, and [s]ure the tidings will not give me [s]o much pain from you, as from the lips of another." "Oh! my gentle love, do not pre[s]s me, you have no idea of what my heart at this moment [s]uffers, while I refu[s]e to gratify your laudable curio[s]ity. Yes, my dear Meriel--- I know the only incentive to be thus pre[s][s]ing, is a generous wi[s]h to relieve my anxiety; but believe me, you cannot form the remote[s]t idea of the cau[s]e. If you could, you would look on me with a mixture of horror and di[s]gu[s]t." "Say not [s]o, Rook[s]by; do not think [s]o meanly of your wife as to [s]uppo[s]e her capapable of thinking of you a moment without affection, without an ardent wi[s]h to [s]ee you as perfectly happy, as it is po[s][s]ible for mortal to be." "Can, my deare[s]t-life, think of no incident that might happen, that would weaken her affection towards me." "None.---Were it po[s][s]ible, (but I know it not) that forgetful of your vows, you could prove fal[s]e to your Meriel [s]he could never forget that you had rai[s]ed her from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-410.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] indigence! that you were her hu[s]band! and the father of her child!" "Deare[s]t, be[s]t of womankind---fal[s]e to thee! No---rather [s]hould my heart cea[s]e to beat. I [s]ee your heroic [s]pirit is adequate to any trial; no longer will I keep you in [s]u[s]pen[s]e. I have [s]een Clara."--- "And, is that all!---fye! Rook[s]by, fye! could you think that would give me a moments pain. Believe me were it in my power to be of the lea[s]t [s]ervice to Mrs. Millar, I would in[s]tantly fly to do it. "Angelic goodne[s]s! but could you indeed forgive her." "I have no right to call her too account, my dear Rook[s]by, for her errors: but tell me, is [s]he in di[s]tre[s]s. If [s]o, I know [s]he is my fellow creature, and it is my duty to relieve her." "Meriel," ([s]aid he catching me in his arms) while tears of exultation bur[s]t from his eyes, "you [s]urpa[s]s even the elevated idea I had formed of your prudence and virtue, Clara is in di[s]tre[s]s, I met her ye[s]terday, with scarcely cloaths to [s]hield her from the inclemency of the weather. She told me [s]he had pa[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-411.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] the two la[s]t nights in the open air, expo[s]ed to nocturnal damps; that lovely form that once was [s]hielded by a tender hu[s]band from even the mo[s]t trifling inconvenience, had nought to re[s]t upon but the cold earth, no canopy but heaven,---and two days had pa[s]t [s]ince [s]he had ta[s]ted food."--- "Merciful heaven, [s]aid I, (while my eyes overflowed,) why have I been kept thus long in ignorance, were is [s]he, let us go, my dear Rook[s]by, [s]hall I quietly enjoy the luxuries of life while poor Clara is in want of even the nece[s][s]aries." "I relieved her at the time, my love. Do not feel [s]o acutely, I even promi[s]ed again to [s]ee her; but my heart [s]mote me, I thought [s]hould it reach your ears, you would think me the be[s]e[s]t of mankind." I [s]hould think you [s]o, indeed, were you capable of beholding unmoved the mi[s]eries of a woman, with whom you once lived on terms of the greate[s]t familiarity: but we are lo[s]ing time. Let us ha[s]ten to the poor [s]ufferer. Who knows, but we may lead her back to the paths of virtue? But hold! you [s]hall go alone, Rook[s]by. She may con[s]ider my pre[s]ence as an in[s]ult." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-412.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] "She mu[s]t, if [s]he reflects at all, my dear Meriel, think it the highe[s]t conde[s]cention; and if you will be [s]o generous as to vi[s]it and promi[s]e her your protection, I will write her a note to prepare her for the interview, and you [s]hall [s]ee her in the afternoon." "You will accompany me then?" "No, dear girl, I will not. After what has pa[s]t, it is impo[s][s]ible to doubt either your delicacy or genero[s]ity. You [s]hall act entirely as your own heart directs. I am [s]ure by leaving you to its dictates, Clara will have no rea[s]on to complain: but let me intreat you not to mention this affair, either to my mother or Mi[s]s Sidney. I am [s]ure they would blame the generous ardour with which you e[s]pou[s]e the cau[s]e of the unfortunate Clara." "I promi[s]ed [s]ilence, and we returned to the hou[s]e, Rook[s]by all life, [s]pirit and tenderness; and I planing fifty different [s]chemes for Clara's future [s]upport. At dinner Mrs. Rook[s]by was quite happy to [s]ee Clement's chearfulne[s]s returned; and Mi[s]s Sidney was too delicate and considerate to a[s]k any que[s]tions concerning his late dejection and ab[s]ence of mind.

Alas, it might have been my fate to wander forlorn and unprotected thro' the world, had it not been for the interpo[s]ition of providence, who [s]o wonderfully inclined the heart of the friendly Mr. Welldon to grant me [s]uccour and relief; and [s]hall I who have experienced [s]uch ble[s][s]ings and [s]upport from an All Governing power, refu[s]e my feeble a[s][s]i[s]tance to rai[s]e from [s]orrow and infamy, a poor fallen [s]i[s]ter. Oh no! That [s]ame benignant Power has pointed out my duty in the cleare[s]t manner, and I tru[s]t will not suffer me to be backward in the performance [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-414.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] of it.---Fully occupied by the[s]e and [s]imilar reflections, I hardly perceived what route the carriage had taken, till it [s]topped at the door of a [s]mall neat cottage. A whole[s]ome looking young woman pre[s]ented her[s]elf. I enquired for Mrs. Millar and was [s]hewn into a parlour and informed [s]he would wait on me immediately. I was [s]carcely [s]eated when the door opened, and (judge if po[s][s]ible my [s]urprize,) Mrs. Moreton entered.---An exclamation of wonder e[s]caped me. Oh! Madam, [s]aid [s]he, and unable to articulate more, [s]unk on the neare[s]t chair, covered her face with her hands and bur[s]t into tears. "Be not alarmed," [s]aid I, in the gentle[s]t accent I could a[s][s]ume, "you have nothing to fear from me. But tell me do you live in this hou[s]e, and are you any ways connected with the unfortunante Mrs. Millar." "Oh! dear lady," [s]aid [s]he, ([s]inking on her knees and rai[s]ing her [s]treaming eyes to my face) "I am that unhappy wretch, I am that ungrateful mon[s]ter who have injured (though Heaven knows involuntarily,) the very woman, who now generou[s]ly comes to [s]ave me from de[s]pair." I was greatly affected, my dear Celia, I rai[s]ed the afflicted penitent, and bade her be comforted. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-415.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] "Comfort!" exclaimed [s]he vehemently, "Alas! where can a wretch, who[s]e crimes are [s]o multiplied as mine, find it?" "It is never denied to the truly penitent: and I hope you will experience its benign influence." "I [s]hall! I begin to feel it already dawn on my benighted [s]oul. It comes adminitered by an angel's hand." I then made [s]ome enquiries concerning her pre[s]ent [s]ituation, and reque[s]ted to be informed, in what manner I could render her [s]ervice which would be mo[s]t acceptable. "You cannot, my dear Madam," [s]aid [s]he, "judge how far I am worthy your compassion, unle[s]s you will permit me to acquaint you with the chief incidents of my pa[s]t life. I know at this moment, I appear to you an unworthy unprincipled wretch. When I think of the [s]ituation, in which I left you at Ken[s]ington, I cannot but reflect how little I [s]hould expect from your hands. Nay that my very life is in your power, but when I [s]hall inform how much I [s]uffered for the unintentional injury I did you, I flatter myself you will pity and forgive me." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-416.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] "But I mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t," [s]aid I, "that you do not enter upon this detail till your situation is rendered more comfortable than it is at pre[s]ent." "Permit me," [s]aid [s]he, interrupting me, "to remain at this cottage a few days. In that time, I will endeavour to commit to your peru[s]al a written account of my miserable life, from the earlie[s]t period of recollection till now. I am [s]en[s]ible you will find much to blame---but, alas! you will find much more to awaken your compa[s][s]ion.--- My crimes, though many, have not been my own: but my afflictions are. I have neither friend or relation to con[s]ole, comfort, or alleviate my angui[s]h." The agony her countenance expre[s][s]ed, as [s]he uttered this, is not to be de[s]cribed. I felt her [s]olitary, forlorn [s]ituation, and while the tear of [s]ympathy trembled in my eye, I breathed forth the accents of conn[s]olation.--- When [s]he grew more compo[s]ed, I aro[s]e to take my leave;---but was [s]adly at a lo[s]s how to offer the a[s][s]i[s]tance I was [s]en[s]ible [s]he wanted, without hurting her feelings. At length I ventured to draw forth my pur[s]e. She laid her hand on my arm---"That is entirely needle[s]s," [s]aid [s]he, "Mr. Rooksby has been very liberal. Let me not be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-417.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] thus oppre[s][s]ed with obligation, till [s]ome way is pointed out for me in [s]ome mea[s]ure to [s]how my gratitude."---"Call it not an obligation," [s]aid I, "It is only a debt due from the happy to the unfortunate." "I have one reque[s]t to make, dear madam," [s]aid [s]he, "[s]uffer me then to decline this offered favour in hopes you will grant me the one nearer my heart."---"Name it," [s]aid I.---"It is," [s]he replied, "that you will forbear mentioning the circum[s]tances that pa[s]t at Kensington to Mr. Rook[s]by, till you have received my letter. After that you will think of me with more clemency than you do at pre[s]ent." I bade her be quite ea[s]y in that re[s]pect, and leaving the pur[s]e on the table returned to the Hall, where I found Mrs. Rook[s]by and Amelia wonderfully curious to know where I had been. "To keep a particular appointment I a[s][s]ure you," [s]aid Clement, "and as I am the only con[s]ident, that is tru[s]ted in the affair, I beg you will not be inqui[s]itive concerning it; for I have promised [s]ecrecy." He did not make any enquiry of what had pa[s][s]ed at our interview, but pointedly avoided the [s]ubject. The next morning he pre[s]ented me with two hundred pounds, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-418.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] saying, "My dear Meriel's expences may at this time be greater than u[s]ual. Make u[s]e of this my love, and [s]hould you require more, you know where to apply." This [s]um I [s]hall look upon as the property of Clara, and when we have [s]ettled [s]ome plan for her future [s]upport, it [s]hall be appropriated entirely to her u[s]e. I was very impatient for the promi[s]ed letter, as I imagined it almo[s]t impo[s][s]ible for her to extenuate a conduct [s]o unju[s]t and cruel as hers had been toward me; but re[s]olved at all events to judge as candidly as po[s][s]ible, and extend toward her a friendship, which may awaken in her mind a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of her pa[s]t errors, and lead her imperceptibly to the love and practice of virtue. At length the long expected packet arrived. I [s]end a copy for my dear Celia's perusal. Oh! my friend, when you have peru[s]ed it, you will like me, [s]hed tears of [s]ympathy over poor Clara's [s]ufferings, till her offences are blotted from your remembrance.--- Farewell, my Celia. Everyaffectionate wi[s]h for your happine[s]s, flows from the heart of your MERIEL. [1] Between this and the preceding letter, [s]everal are omited, as they contained only the common events of life. During this time Mrs. Rook[s]by informs her friend [s]he is become the mother of a daughter.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-419.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] Though I have taken up my pen to address the mo[s]t benevolent woman on earth, I [s]hudder to think in what a de[s]picable light I [s]hall appear.---Oh! Madam, the heart not entirely rendered callous by guilt, [s]hrinks from the [s]crutinizing eye of [s]uperior virtue, yet painful as the ta[s]k is, I feel it is a duty I owe, to you, to my[s]elf, and to my dear forsaken children.---I am not, madam, as my [s]i[s]ter-in-law repre[s]ented to Mr. Rook[s]by, the daughter of a decayed officer; Alas! my friend[s]hip with this cruel [s]i[s]ter, has been the chief cau[s]e of all my guilt and mi[s]ery. My father was a gentleman of genteel fortune, and un[s]ullied reputation. I was his only child, and at the age of thirteen having lo[s]t my mother was placed at a boarding [s]chool near Oxford, where I received a genteel education; and to my utter regret formed an acquaintance with Eleanor Ram[s]ay, [s]he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-420.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] five years older than my[s]elf and was a teacher in this [s]chool, [s]he had an expen[s]ive ta[s]te for dre[s]s, and was pa[s][s]ionately fond of gaiety and plea[s]ure. My father made me a liberal allowance for my pocket expen[s]es. Eleanor was not [s]o amply [s]upplied, [s]he told me that her father had been dead for [s]ome years and her mother's income was extremely confined tho' [s]he [s]trained it to the utmo[s]t in order that her[s]elf and brother might have the benefit of a liberal education.---Young Ramsay was a genteel engaging youth, and at that time employed in the [s]tudy of the law. He frequently came to vi[s]it his [s]i[s]ter, and [s]ometimes took her to places of public entertainment, in which excur[s]ions I was imprudently allowed to accompany them. Ram[s]ay pretended to be [s]truck with my per[s]on; but I have [s]ince been convinced the fortune my father po[s][s]e[s][s]ed and of which I was [s]uppo[s]ed heire[s]s, was the chief incentive to the pa[s][s]ion he [s]o ardently pro[s]e[s][s]ed. Eleanor was plain in her per[s]on, but artful and in[s]inuating in her manner. She con[s]tantly contrived parties of plea[s]ure, in which I was included: and in return I [s]upplied her with money to purchase any article of finery which her own narrow allowance would not afford.--- In this manner we proceeded till I reached my [s]ixteenth year, when on receiving a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-421.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] summons from my father to prepare to quit [s]chool entirely, Ram[s]ay and his [s]i[s]ter [s]hewed [s]uch marks of affliction at our approaching separation, the former declaring his exi[s]tence depended on my con[s]tancy and affection; that giddy, thoughtle[s]s, and ea[s]ily per[s]uaded, I con[s]ented to an elopement and accompanied the[s]e fal[s]e friends to Scotland, where I [s]ealed my[s]elf the mo[s]t wretched of womankind, by uniting my[s]elf to an unprincipled wretch, in who[s]e whole family there was not one atom of honour or genero[s]ity.---On our return we ha[s]tened to my father and humbly reque[s]ted his pardon and ble[s][s]ing.--- Alas! I had forfeited all claim to both. He [s]purned me from him, and declared he would never [s]ee my face again. Overwhelmed with afflicton, I had now no cour[s]e to take, but to repair with my hu[s]band to London to his mother and [s]i[s]ter, who, I thought, received me very coldly, con[s]idering how eagerly they had [s]trove to promote the union. Even Ram[s]ay him[s]elf was much altered in his manner and I began to perceive, that they considered me as a burthen. I wrote a mo[s]t penetential letter to my father, reque[s]ting to be received, and offering to quit a man, whom I found my heart was by no means attached to; but the an[s]wer I received was, that as I had voluntarily quitted his protection for that of a hu[s]band, and taken the liberty to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-422.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] choo[s]e for my[s]elf, without con[s]ulting him on the propriety of my choice, I mu[s]t take the con[s]equence of my precipitancy: but, he feared, if I paid as little regard to the duties of a wife, as I had done to tho[s]e of a daughter, my hu[s]band would [s]oon have reason to repent our union. He enclo[s]ed me a note for two hundred pounds, declaring it was all I mu[s]t ever expect, as he had made his will in favour of a [s]i[s]ter's [s]on then abroad in the navy. This money proved a seasonable relief, as Mrs. Ram[s]ay's affairs were greatly deranged; but it was [s]oon expended, and I was again reduced to bear the illnature of all the family; for Ram[s]ay never entertained a thought of giving me even an apartment to my[s]elf, nor indeed was it in his power, as he had no employment by which we could hope to be [s]upported. We had been married about a twelve-month, when he received an offer of accompanying a young gentleman abroad. This he eagerly accepted, and I was left with Mrs. Ramsay. My [s]ituation was as uncomfortable as you can po[s][s]ibly imagine, I had not money even for nece[s][s]ary expences, and I could not help perceiving, that even my food was grudged by my mother-in-law. I thought once more of making a per[s]onal application to my father, but to my great affliction, he at that time died [s]uddenly, and all his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-423.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] property devolved to the relation I have already mentioned. Though Mrs. Ram[s]ay's finances were very confined, [s]he lived in an expen[s]ive manner, kept a good deal of company and went frequently into public. One night being with her at the play, we were acco[s]ted by an elderly gentleman, who [s]at in the box with us, [s]hewed us many civilities during the evening, and when the entertainment was ended, in[s]i[s]ted on [s]etting us down at our own door in his carriage, I thought there was an impropriety in accepting the[s]e civilities from a perfect [s]tranger; but as my mother and [s]i[s]ter acquie[s]ced, I knew it would only be deemed prudery in me to re[s]i[s]t.---I, therefore, followed their example, and steped into the carriage. When we arrived at home, the gentleman a[s]ked permi[s][s]ion to enquire after our health the en[s]uing morning, which was granted. On our entering the hou[s]e I began to rally Eleanor on the conquest [s]he had made, as I naturally imagined the[s]e civilities were intended for her, but Mrs. Ram[s]ay cried with more good humour than I had heard her [s]peak for [s]ome time.[s] "No, no! my dear, Eleanor has no right to the glory of the conque[s]t, I fancy it is you, my pretty Clara, who have attracted the old gentleman's notice; Eleanor's per[s]on is not adapted for making conque[s]ts.---"I hope you are mi[s]taken, madam," I replied; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-424.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] "for I [s]hould greatly rejoice in any good fortune which may happen to my [s]i[s]ter. For my own part, my lot is ca[s]t." The next morning, Mr. Millar (for it was he, who had acco[s]ted us the night before) called, and after chatting [s]ome time on indifferent [s]ubjects, offered to take us that evening to Ranelagh. From this time an intimacy commenced, and I [s]oon really understood, that my unfortunate per[s]on had been the object of his pur[s]uit. It was in vain I remon[s]trated on the impropriety of a married woman li[s]tening to overtures of love. Mrs. Ram[s]ay treated the remon[s]trance as folly and romance. What [s]hall I [s]ay, my dear madam, ill treated at home, di[s]tre[s][s]ed in my circum[s]tances, no friend near to whom I could apply for advice or a[s][s]i[s]tance. I insensibly gave way to the delu[s]ions of [s]plendor and affluence, and one evening at a masquerade con[s]ented to my ruin.---A few days after this fatal night, I went with Mr. Millar to Oxford, which was the place of his residence. Eleanor accompanied me and I assumed the name of Millar. As I had not received a line from my hu[s]band [s]ince his departure from England, I imagined he had totally forgot me and would be as happy to be relea[s]ed from the burthen of maintaining [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-425.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] me, as he once pretended he [s]hould be in obtaining my hand. Mr. Millar was extremely fond of me, I endeavoured as much as was in my power to return this affection with gratitude; but alas! madam, I was far from happy. Conscious guilt had fixed her fangs in my bo[s]om and knowing my[s]elf unworthy the attentions I daily received from the virtuous part of my [s]ex. I began to envy a [s]uperiority, the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of which had given me [s]o much pain; but though I was far from happy I had not yet ta[s]ted the mi[s]ery of loving one object, while I felt my[s]elf bound to another. That [s]uperlative exce[s]s of angui[s]h was re[s]erved for me, 'till accident introduced Mr. Millar to Mr. Rook[s]by. I will not repeat the [s]teps I took, (tears of contrition bathe my cheeks while I write it) to deceive the worthy Mr. Millar, and indulge my tenderness for Rook[s]by. Suffice it to [s]ay I gave a loo[s]e to love, and experienced its effects with more violence, as it was the fir[s]t time my heart had ever been [s]en[s]ible of the pa[s][s]ion; and certain it is, when we have taken one [s]tep in guilt we never pau[s]e at a second or a third, when either intere[s]t or pleasure urges our pur[s]uit. You have no doubt been informed of my leaving Mr. Millar and following Mr. Rock[s]by to town; I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-426.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] [s]hall therefore pa[s]s over every circum[s]tance that en[s]ued until my acquaintance with you, (then Mi[s]s Howard) at Mrs. La Cours, and your [s]ub[s]equent removal to Ken[s]ington. At that time I had relinqui[s]hed the name of Millar; but as I had an invincible aver[s]ion to that of Ram[s]ay, and Mr. Rook[s]by refused me his, I a[s][s]umed my own maiden name of Moreton. While I re[s]ided at Kensington, I received Mr. Rook[s]by's vi[s]its very privately, as he was anxious for me to preserve my character, and I wi[s]hed to appear to you in the light of an amiable woman. I [s]aw you regarded me with e[s]teem, and I knew your heart too well to [s]uppo[s]e that e[s]teem would be continued, if you knew I was a [s]lave to guilty pa[s][s]ion.---Believe me, deare[s]t, be[s]t of womankind, I never entertained an idea to your di[s]advantage. I wished from my [s]oul to promote your welfare, and have taught my heart to rejoice in your pro[s]perity, though that pro[s]perity has torn from my agonized heart every earthly good: but to proceed---The day before I called on you and be[s]poke the linen for my [s]i[s]ter Eleanor, I had received a note from Mrs. Ramsay informing me that a particular relation was come to town, and as they were unacquainted with my connection with Mr. Millar, &c. and [s]till regarded me as the wife of her [s]on, [s]he wi[s]hed me to come to town [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-427.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] and make them a vi[s]it, taking the elde[s]t child with me. On the morning preceding the day on which this vi[s]it was to be paid, Eleanor let my watch fall, and without acquainting me with the circum[s]tance [s]ent it to have the damage repaired. You know what followed. I went to town; but, alas! on my arrival at my mother's, who [s]hould I meet but my unworthy hu[s]band. I now too late di[s]covered that my [s]i[s]ter had been in the plot to betray me. He in[s]tantly claimed me, as his lawful wife, and in[s]i[s]ted on my accompanying him abroad, from whence, he [s]aid, he had only returned to fetch me; as he had through the intere[s]t of his friend, obtained a very re[s]pectable place under the French government. It was in vain to remon[s]trate. I was was obliged to comply, and early the next morning we [s]et off for Dover, leaving the children with Mrs. Ram[s]ay. On our arrival in that place, it was too late to think of cro[s][s]ing the channel that night. We therefore be[s]poke a pa[s][s]age on board a packet, and as it was to [s]ail by five o'clock the next morning, we retired early to bed. But judge, dear madam, if po[s][s]ible, my angui[s]h and [s]urprize, when awaking about [s]even o'clock, I found my hu[s]band and [s]i[s]ter had left me, and taken with them my trunks containing all my clothes, jewels, money, &c. leaving me [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-428.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] nothing but about [s]ix guineas which I had in my pocket. I aro[s]e with a heavy heart, and ordered [s]ome breakfa[s]t. While I was taking my [s]olitary meal, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, and inquiring of the maid who attended what company was then in the hou[s]e, I learnt that Mr. Rook[s]by was there on his way to France, and that the packet he had taken for him[s]elf and servants did not [s]ail till the next ride. I then remembered his informing me at his la[s]t vi[s]it, that he [s]hould be obliged to vi[s]it the continent before he could [s]ee me again, and overjoyed to find him in the [s]ame hou[s]e with me, con[s]idered the treatment I had [s]uffered from my hu[s]band as a fortunate circumctance, as it would probably procure me the plea[s]ure of accompanying my adored Rook[s]by abroad. Pardon, madam, the[s]e involuntary expre[s][s]ions of affection, I will [s]trive to re[s]train my pen: but when the heart has once been [s]trongly attached, it is hard to break it of its u[s]ual effu[s]ions of tenderne[s]s. I bid the [s]ervent [s]hew me to the room where he was, and ru[s]hing into it, overcome with the various emotions, which agitated my bo[s]om, I fainted in his arms. It will be needle[s]s to repeat our conversation. I mu[s]t only remark, that as I had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-429.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] never informed him of my unfortunate marriage with Ram[s]ay, and, as he had always [s]uppo[s]ed me the wife of Mr. Millar, I did not dare explain to him the real cau[s]e of my abrupt appearance at Dover. He attributed it [s]olely to my affection to him[s]elf, and I ble[s]t the chance which had led me to him. On our return from the continent, I made many enquiries concerning my dear Mi[s]s Howard, for whom I had [s]uffered many an anxious hour; but could not by any means learn where you had taken refuge after the inhuman treatment you had experienced at Ken[s]ington. I make no doubt, madam, but you are acquainted with every circum[s]tance, preceding the time in which I had hoped to be united to Mr. Rook[s]by. I had previou[s]ly wrote to Mrs. Ram[s]ay, requesting, [s]he would u[s]e her intere[s]t with her [s]on to relinqui[s]h all claim to me as his wife, and indeed, I had been informed I could refute that claim by pleading infancy at the time of my imprudent elopement. To the[s]e letters I received the mo[s]t [s]atisfactory answers, [s]igned by both Ram[s]ay and his mother, declaring they were heartily weary of the connection and would gladly renounce it, on condition of my paying a [s]tipulated [s]um of money, to which I readily agreed, and began [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-430.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] to look forward with hope to days of future happine[s]s, and let me add innocence, for I felt my heart [s]o firmly attached to the generous Rook[s]by, as to render it impo[s][s]ible for me ever to injure him even in thought. But, ah! my dear madam, how [s]oon were the[s]e bright pro[s]pects overclouded, how quickly was this charming hope [s]natched from me, and, my bo[s]om left a chearle[s]s and de[s]olate chaos, which peace or joy can never more enliven. When I endeavour to retrace this mo[s]t heart rending period of my life: [s]uch agonizing feelings overpower me, that my tears flow in [s]calding torrents down my cheeks; and [s]ighs of acute angui[s]h rend my bo[s]om. I cannot at pre[s]ent proceed in my recital.---Oh! heavens, that one who knows [s]o well the ju[s]t value of virtue, [s]hould be irre[s]i[s]tibly impelled to actions from which her [s]oul [s]hrinks with horror. The innocent may pity, but they cannot have the remote[s]t idea of my [s]ufferings. IN CONTINUATION. My heart is more at ea[s]e, tears are a [s]weet relief to the unfortunate, and when I remembered the words of con[s]olation which I had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-431.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] li[s]tened to from the lips of angelic purity, when the benevolent Mrs. Rook[s]by cheared me with her pre[s]ence, a [s]oothing reflection, [s]omething like hope, pervaded my bo[s]om, and though tears [s]till continued to fall, they fell without pain. I will now proceed in my narrative. On the evening preceding the day on which I flattered my[s]elf with becoming the happie[s]t of my [s]ex, I expected Mrs. Ram[s]ay to receive the money which I had promi[s]ed to pay her, and therefore, de[s]ired the [s]ervants to deny me, even to the cho[s]en ma[s]ter of my affections. Unfortunate hour, of what [s]cenes of mi[s]ery wert thou the harbinger, but I will not complain, I acknowledge I de[s]erved it all, for had I not deceived the be[s]t the worhie[s]t of mankind, by daring to accept his honourable offers, when I knew my[s]elf already [s]acrificed(I will not [s]ay united) to a villain. But what will not a woman do, who loves, who doats to madne[s]s and fears to be separated forever from the object of her adoration, what errors will not the heart involuntarily commit when under the influence of hood-winked pa[s][s]ion?--- It was about nine o'clock as I was [s]itting in the nur[s]ery, with my two dear boys, that a [s]ervant informed me the per[s]on whom I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-432.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] expected was below, I ki[s][s]ed my [s]weet cherubs bade them good night and repaired to the parlour, which I had appointed to receive Mrs. Ram[s]ay in; but how great was my a[s]toni[s]hment on entering the room to [s]ee my inexorable tormenter and his [s]i[s]ter Eleanor, with their mother. I gave a [s]hriek and [s]unk trembling on the neare[s]t chair. Ram[s]ay approached me with feigned tenderne[s]s--- "why the[s]e alarms, my dear Clara," [s]aid he "why [s]hould you [s]tart thus to behold the man who adores you, and who though you have cruelly de[s]erted and injured, is ready again to receive you to his arms, and willing to forget all that is pa[s]t."---"would to heaven" [s]aid I, "that every pa[s]t action of my life could be buried in eternal oblivion, particularly that to which I was artfully led by you and your in[s]inuating [s]i[s]ter, of giving you my hand, when a moment's reflection would have convinced me you had no [s]hare in my heart."--- "It is well, madam," [s]aid he, "you have made a frank confe[s][s]ion; but know it is amply in my power to revenge the repeated in[s]ults and injuries I have received from you.---You flatter your[s]elf it is in your power to annual a marriage contracted in your minority, but it is not; and unle[s]s you con[s]ent to make me ma[s]ter of all the money and jewels at pre[s]ent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-433.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] in your po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and leaving this hou[s]e accompany me wherever I choo[s]e to go, I will to-morrow follow you to the Church and in the face of the whole congregation expo[s]e your infamous conduct, and claim my prior right not only to your per[s]on, but to all the wealth your infatuated lover has heaped upon you."---What were my [s]ufferings at this horrid moment. Turn either way, infamy [s]tared me in the face. I was unable to determine what plan to pur[s]ue. To remain in London was impo[s][s]ible, after what had pa[s]t as I [s]hould undoubtedly have been the je[s]t even of my own [s]ervants. At length I concluded, whatever might be my fate, the generous Rook[s]by [s]hould not be involved in the [s]hame that would con[s]equently en[s]ue on a public expo[s]ure of my guilt, I therefore told Ram[s]ay I was ready to accompany him wherever he plea[s]ed; but as to the pre[s]ents I had received from Mr. Rook[s]by, I did not conceive I had any right to take them with me.--- This was not what the wretch wanted Horrible menaces and threats were u[s]ed to prevail on me to give him my ca[s]h and jewels, I was intirely in the power of the[s]e three wretches, nor did I dare even to call for the a[s][s]i[s]tance of my [s]ervants, as they all declared my life [s]hould pay the forfeit of [s]uch an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-434.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] attempt: and when they had gained their point, and I attempted to go up [s]tairs to fetch the jewels, both Mrs. Rain[s]ay and Eleanor accompanied me. On returning to the parlour, they de[s]ired me to [s]end for a Hackney Coach.---Then it was, dear madam that my innocent infants darted acro[s]s my memory. "I mu[s]t have my children," [s]aid I.---"Indeed, [s]aid the unfeeling Ram[s]ay, but you will not. The brats are none of mine; leave them then to him who has a right to maintain them." To de[s]cribe my angui[s]h at this cruel [s]peech is impo[s][s]ible.---You, madam, are a mother, and it is only a mother can conceive my sufferings. I knelt, I bathed his feet with tears, and embraced his knees, but in vain. Too much under the dominion of fear to exert my[s]elf to in[s]i[s]t on their being taken with me, I [s]uffered my[s]elf to be led more dead than alive to the coach; and that very night we all [s]et out for Cornwall. What arts they made u[s]e of to deceive my [s]ervant, I know not; but before our departure from London my trunks were brought to Mrs. Ramsay's, and one [s]mall one containing every nece[s][s]ary for travelling was opened that I might dre[s]s my[s]elf in a proper manner for [s]o long a journey. I never could learn how they had contrived this, but am rather led [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-435.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] to imagine they had bribed my own woman to their intere[s]t.---During my comfortle[s]s journey, all my thoughts were occupied by my beloved children, who were left entirely to the humanity of a man, whom I had deceived and injured in the gro[s][s]e[s]t manner, and who might avenge the mother's crimes by de[s]erting her offspring. I was [s]en[s]ible Rook[s]by po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a benevolent heart, but when I remembered the provocations I had given him---I trembled for the fate of my poor infants, who[s]e only birth-rights were poverty, [s]hame, and the contempt of the world. It is impo[s][s]ibe for any one, who has not been in the [s]ame [s]ituation to judge of my di[s]tre[s]s. The anxiety of my mind affected my health, and before we arrived at our journey's end I was in a high fever. We [s]topped at a village near Salta[s]h, where my di[s]order increa[s]ed to [s]uch a degree that it was dangerous to think of removing me. A delirium en[s]ued and I raved (as I have been [s]ince informed) ince[s][s]antly for Rook[s]by and my children. At length, youth and a good con[s]titution combated the [s]trength of my di[s]order; and after a profound [s]leep of many hours, I awoke to perfect rea[s]on; but Gracious Heaven! what were my feelings, to learn when I enquired for Ram[s]ay and Eleanor, that they were gone, and with them all my property. The clergyman of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-436.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] parish a humane [s]en[s]ible man had frequently vi[s]ited me, during my illne[s]s, and now entered the room with an intent to [s]ee if I yet lived. It was to him I had been indebted for all the attentions that had been [s]hewn me: and when he found me capable of reading, he put into my hands a letter which he [s]aid my brother had left for me. At the word brother I expre[s][s]ed [s]ome a[s]toni[s]hment: but my curio[s]ity and impatience to read the letter would not then permit an explanation. This was the letter - In your attempts to dupe others you have been effectually duped your[s]elf. Vain, foolish woman, who thought your boa[s]ted beauty would in[s]ure you admirers in all who beheld you. Ram[s]ay is not your hu[s]band. He was mine long before he [s]aw you. From the fir[s]t moment he beheld you, I [s]aw you had [s]upplanted me in his affections, and therefore determined on revenge. I have (thank my kind genius) amply effected it, and reduced you to the lowe[s]t aby[s]s of infamy and [s]hame. My mother exults in your deba[s]ement, and bids you go vaunt your fancied [s]uperiority, and [s]ee if it will regain the reputation you have lo[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-437.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] You have no right to the name of Ramsay, nor indeed, to any but that of Moreton, which you have [s]hamefully di[s]graced. Ram[s]ay, was my maiden name, and as my marriage was a private one, my hu[s]band when vi[s]iting me always cho[s]e to a[s][s]ume that, and pa[s]s for my brother. I enclo[s]e you ten pounds, if you live it will be of [s]ome [s]ervice to you, if not, whoever opens this may make u[s]e of it for pa[s]t expences. I [s]incerely, and from my [s]oul, wi[s]h your recovery, as my triumph will not be complete, unle[s]s I know you have felt the misery, in which I glory to have involved you. ELEANOR. Before I had fini[s]hed this inhuman letter, I fell into [s]trong convul[s]ions, which occasioned a relap[s]e of my di[s]order, and I was again reduced to in[s]anity. The humane clergyman had me removed to his own hou[s]e, and by the kind attentions of him[s]elf and a daughter, I was in time re[s]tored to health and a keen [s]en[s]e of my deplorable [s]ituation. As my [s]trength returned, my afflictions recurred to my mind with greater force--- My dear de[s]erted infants peri[s]hing for want, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-438.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] or expo[s]ed to the har[s]h u[s]age experienced by children left to the pari[s]h, were constantly before my eyes, and I re[s]olved at all events to return to London and learn their fate. Ill as my benevolent ho[s]t could afford it, he lent me three guineas to help me on my journey, and gave me a letter to a poor woman, a late pari[s]hioner of his, who was married and [s]ettled in London, requesting her to render me every [s]ervice in her power. With this [s]lender [s]um, I [s]at forward and after a weari[s]ome journey, sometimes riding, [s]ometimes walking, I arrived [s]afe in town, and took up my abode with the per[s]on ju[s]t mentioned. From the enquiries I made (for I had the temerity to venture to Mr. Rook[s]by's hou[s]e) I learnt his happy marriage with the amiable Mi[s]s Howard, and inwardly rejoiced to think that in [s]uch a union, his future happine[s]s mu[s]t be [s]ecure. I al[s]o learnt, that my children were in Devon[s]hire. The maternal heart will yearn to pour forth its affection. I had determined to walk to the environs of Oak-hall and endeavour to gain a [s]ight of my beloved little ones, when a mo[s]t untoward accident prevented my putting my de[s]igns in execution. This was my kind landlady falling ill, and as [s]he kept a [s]hop, her hu[s]band earne[s]tly entreated me to remain with them till her recovery; to which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-439.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] as I was under many obligations to them, I could not but a[s][s]ent. Her illne[s]s was painful and lingering, and in the end terminated her life. Soon after her decea[s]e, I proposed removing from the hou[s]e, when the very man, who had [s]o earne[s]tly entreated my [s]tay, now demanded payment for my board and lodging. I had neither money nor friends. What could I do? I thought once of applying to Mr. Rook[s]by; but the fear of giving you pain prevented me. I submitted to my hard fate in [s]ilence and was conveyed to pri[s]on. Three months did I linger in this wretched place, huddled among the mo[s]t abject and mi[s]erable of the human race; and barely exi[s]ting on the [s]canty pittance allowed me, and the charity of the benevolent. At length, I was one day recognized by a trade[s]man, with whom I had dealt in my days of affluence. He commiserated my condition, generou[s]ly paid the [s]um for which I had been confined, and gave me two guineas in my pocket. No [s]ooner was I at liberty, than I re[s]umed my wi[s]h of going to my children. I [s]et forward and almo[s]t begged my way to this place; but alas! when here, what could I do for [s]upport, what door would open to receive a poor wretch like me? I wandered every day round the environs of the hall, and once had the extatic plea[s]ure of catching a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-440.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] glance of my children: but I dared not [s]peak to them, though I longed to fold them to my maternal heart. My little [s]tock of money was [s]oon exhau[s]ted, though I lived almo[s]t upon bread and water, and at night, re[s]ted my weary limbs on the damp ground. But con[s]cience told me it was all right, and only a ju[s]t puni[s]hment for my errors; [s]o I bore it without complaint, and watered my cold pillow with tears of unfeigned repentance. One afternoon, as I was wandering in the adjacent fields, overcome by hunger and di[s]tre[s]s, I [s]at down be[s]ide a brook that ran along the wood[s]ide and after reflecting a few moments on the horrors of my [s]ituation, I conceived the impious idea of putting a period to my existence. I aro[s]e from my [s]eat to put my design in execution, when hearing a ru[s]tling on the other [s]ide the hedge, I [s]tarted; and in a moment [s]aw Mr. Rook[s]by come acro[s]s a [s]tile into the field where I was. I gave a faint [s]cream and [s]unk to the ground oppressed by unde[s]cribable emotions. Urged by humanity, he approached and rai[s]ed me from the earth. I opened my eyes; but dared not look at him. "Poor [s]oul," [s]aid he, in the accent of benevolence, "you [s]eem ill. Where [s]hall I lead you, or what can I do to [s]erve you." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-441.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] "Leave me," I replied, with a look and voice of de[s]traction---"Leave me Rook[s]by to the fate I merit."---"Gracious heaven!" [s]aid he, "is it po[s][s]ible, or do my [s]en[s]es deceive me?"---"Oh!" [s]aid I, cla[s]ping my hands, "pity the wretched Clara, and leave her to die in peace." "Clara," cried he, [s]lackening the arm that had [s]upported me, "poor infatuated woman, how came you thus reduced?"--- I need not repeat what an[s]wer I made--- [s]uffice it to [s]ay, I [s]aw the tear of compa[s][s]ion [s]parkle in his eye, and heard him declare, I [s]hould be permitted to [s]ee my children.--- He gave me relief with a liberal hand, and at parting, de[s]ired I would let him know where to find me, that I might not be again reduced to [s]uch mi[s]ery. Thus, madam, have I retraced a life of complicated guilt and [s]orrow. I am fully [s]en[s]ible of the benevolence and candor of your heart, and I tru[s]t my unfeigned penitence joined to my [s]ufferings will expunge from your memory my faults. Teach me, dear madam, how to convince you of my gratitude for your great conde[s]cen[s]ion in intere[s]ting your[s]elf in the fate of [s]o worthle[s]s a being as I am, and whatever plan your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-442.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] goodne[s]s [s]hall [s]trike out, I will invaribly pursue, in hopes that my future life will convince you, with what abhorrence I reflect on my pa[s]t mi[s]conduct. I have the honour to be, &c. &c. CLARA MORETON. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Oak-hall June 29th , 1783. I WAS obliged to [s]end away my la[s]t in [s]uch a hurry, I had no time to make the lea[s]t remark on Clara's letter. I will confe[s]s the [s]tory it contained did not [s]trike me as altogether con[s]i[s]tent or probable; but I made great allowances for that [s]elf love, which urges us ever to extenuate as much as possible our errors; and endeavour to [s]et our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-443.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] conduct in the faire[s]t point of view. I al[s]o remembered, that whatever had been her errors, [s]he was now penitent and in di[s]tre[s]s; and mu[s]t, unle[s]s [s]ome friend [s]tepped forward to [s]ave her, [s]ink into an untimely grave. I did not he[s]itate in re[s]olving to become that friend, though I determined to keep the whole affair concealed from Mrs. Rook[s]by and Mi[s]s Sidney, and, indeed, I inwardly wi[s]hed that Rook[s]by might not de[s]ire to [s]ee Clara's confe[s][s]ion, as by reading it he mu[s]t di[s]cover that I had known her before, which would immediately bring on an explanation of her cruel behavior to me, which he would not be very ready to overlook or pardon.--- Fortunately he never even expre[s][s]ed the [s]lighte[s]t de[s]ire to know what [s]he had [s]aid. I told him, [s]he [s]hould never want a friend, while I had power to a[s][s]i[s]t her; and he seemed perfectly [s]atisfied of the [s]incerity of my assertion. Accordingly I wrote to her, informing her if [s]he would mention any place where [s]he would like to re[s]ide, I would undertake to pay her board and be[s]ides allow [s]omething hand[s]ome for other nece[s][s]ary expences; but recommended to her to fix her re[s]idence in the country, where there would be fewer allurements to draw her from the laudable re[s]olutions [s]he had formed of amendment. I received for an[s]wer, that the fondne[s]s of a mother impelled her to wi[s]h her re[s]idence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-444.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] might be in the neighborhood of Oak-hall, and that [s]he was perfectly [s]atisfied with the family, with whom [s]he then was; but if I di[s]approved of her remaining there, [s]he was ready to remove to any other place I might think more [s]uitable. I am a mother my[s]elf, my dear Celia, and I found it was impo[s][s]ible to deny her reque[s]t. She is now [s]ettled at the farm, and I have ordered the two boys to be taken twice a week to [s]ee her, though under this restriction, that [s]he does not betray her[s]elf to them, as that would involve us all in confu[s]ion at the hall, as I am certain my mother and Mi[s]s Sidney would be greatly di[s]plea[s]ed with my taking any intere[s]t in her affairs, or [s]uffering her to be [s]o near our habitation; [s]he continues the name of Moreton, and as [s]he lives retired, and I would hope a truly penitent and virtuous life. She does not excite any enquiries that might lead to a di[s]covery. IN CONTINUATION. Augu[s]t 3d . La[s]t night Mr. Belger arrived. I cannot account for it, Celia, but the pre[s]ence of this man always di[s]tre[s][s]es and alarms me. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-445.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] am never comfortable when he is in the family, though it is only for a vi[s]it of a few hours. How I [s]hall [s]upport his company for [s]ix weeks or two months, I cannot tell. It is a long time [s]ince I have mentioned my [s]weet Clementina; believe me, were I to give inclination the reins; I [s]hould fill a whole [s]heet with accounts of the dear little cherub's daily improvement. But, though the theme would be delightful for a fond mother to expatiate upon, I am [s]en[s]ible it would be but in[s]ipid, when offered to the peru[s]al of one who though intere[s]ted in all my concerns, never felt a mother's tenderne[s]s, anxiety and [s]olicitude. 10th . You will be [s]urprized, my dear Celia, when I tell you, I am become the lady Bountiful of all our poor tenants and their families. I walk round every morning or evening; that the weather permits, and admini[s]ter to the de[s]ea[s]es of both body and mind. In the fir[s]t I am a[s][s]i[s]ted by a worthy apothecary, who having a large [s]hare of merit, Fortune thought he had [s]ufficient, and was therefore extremely [s]paring of her favours; [s]o that the poor man with a great deal of knowledge in his head, much benevolence in his heart, and a large family in his hou[s]e, had but very [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-446.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] little money in his pur[s]e. I heard of him by accident, and not being extremely well, [s]ent for him, though his unpowdered wig and thread-bare coat would not have been a recommendation, had I con[s]ulted his appearance only; but I chatted with him half an hour [s]everal mornings [s]ucce[s][s]ively, and found his company more efficacious than his medicines; for I was always better after his vi[s]its, the rea[s]on of which was, I thought the doctor him[s]elf [s]eemed happier. So one afternoon, Amelia and I took a [s]troll acro[s]s the park, and [s]pent an hour or two with his wife and her [s]ix chubby, ro[s]y cheeked children, and at parting, contrived it [s]o that at the next vi[s]it the doctor came neither in an unpowdered wig or thread-bare coat; [s]ince which time he has con[s]tantly been our e[s]corte in our vi[s]its to the [s]ick. I find money and he finds phy[s]ic, and I do a[s][s]ure you we are both very well plea[s]ed with our [s]everal departments. Be[s]ides you cannot think how the doctor is ri[s]ing in reputation, [s]ince his appearance is [s]o mended. He is now often [s]een coming out of the doors of the wealthy, which I hope pre[s]ages he will one day become wealthy him[s]elf.

I am extremely flurried and vexed, indeed I think my evil genius prevailed, when Rook[s]by fir[s]t formed an acquaintance with Belger. The man is an unprincipled libertine, and Amelia was greatly mi[s]taken, when [s]he imagined any tie however [s]acred, would be re[s]triction upon his licentious passion.--- Rook[s]by had rode out la[s]t evening, Amelia was reading to Mrs. Rook[s]by, and I imagining Belger was with my hu[s]band, took a book in my hand and [s]trolled out to indulge a contemplative mood, which at that time prevailed over my mind. I rambled farther than I at fir[s]t intended, and before I was aware of it, the [s]hades of night came on.---The evening was remarkably fine, the moon aro[s]e veiled in a fleecy cloud, which [s]erved only to increa[s]e the glory it could not hide; a gentle zephyr whi[s]pered through the trees, and I felt a [s]en[s]ation of gratitude, wonder and delight pervade my [s]oul; whil[s]t admiring, I beheld the beauty of the [s]urrounding [s]cene, at the top of a walk at no great di[s]tance from the hou[s]e, but on a little eminence, there is a summerhouse greatly admired by all the family for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-448.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] the charming view it commands of an extensive well cultivated country. In this place I had been working in the morning, and in pa[s][s]ing it, recollected I had left my work-bag there, in which was [s]omething I wanted. I therefore [s]tepped in with a de[s]ign of bringing it away. The moon [s]hone through the windows full upon an organ which was placed there for me to entertain my[s]elf with, and as I am fond of [s]olemn mu[s]ic, the stillness of the evening and the [s]erenity of every [s]urrounding object in[s]pired me with a wi[s]h to touch the in[s]trument. I therefore [s]at down, and following the impul[s]e of my [s]oul, began the following Hymn to Gratitude: Where'er I turn my ravi[s]h'd eyes, New [s]cenes of beauty round me ri[s]e, My heart exulting glows; And While I view the wond'rous whole, To the Creative Power my [s]oul, With gratitude o'erflows. You burning orbs, that round the pole, In [s]olemn grand [s]ucce[s][s]ion roll, Declare their Maker's power; Then while [s]uch glories deck the [s]ky, Can [s]uch a weak frail worm as I But wor[s]hip and adore. Father of all thou do[s]t be[s]tow On us poor reptiles here below, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-449.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] Each good we're taught to prize; And tho' [s]ometimes we feel thy frown, The truly grateful heart mu[s]t own Thy judgments ju[s]t and wi[s]e.

I had [s]ung it over once, and was ju[s]t repeating the la[s]t [s]tanza with all the real fervour which at that moment warmed my [s]oul, when hearing a foot[s]tep, I turned round and [s]aw Mr. Belger enter the [s]ummer hou[s]e. "So you are returned," [s]aid I, ri[s]ing from my [s]eat; "but pray where is Rook[s]by." "I have not been with him," replied Belger, "nor do I think he is returned. I have been enjoying a far greater plea[s]ure, than any he can meet with abroad. I have been li[s]tening to your charming voice, which with [s]uch enthu[s]ia[s]tic fervour, has been pouring forth the grateful emotions of your [s]oul." "I have been here [s]ome time," [s]aid I carele[s]sly, "and I believe it is getting late. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-450.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] Pray do not let me interrupt your intended ramble; but I am afraid of taking cold [s]hould I remain here any longer." "You mu[s]t not go, deare[s]t, lovelie[s]t of women, I cannot lo[s]e this only opportunity which I have had of [s]peaking to you without ob[s]ervation. Hear me, pity me! From the fir[s]t moment, that I beheld you, my heart has known neither joy nor peace. In every place, in every hour, [s]leeping or waking, your image [s]till pur[s]ues me. I love, I doat to madne[s]s and yet have only the hope of exciting your compa[s][s]ion." "My contempt [s]ir, you certainly excite, by this unparalled effrontery. I thought Mr. Belger had received my an[s]wer on this subject [s]ome years [s]ince, and am [s]urprized however, he then dared to in[s]ult an unprotected girl, that he [s]hould [s]uppo[s]e he might with impunity now repeat tho[s]e in[s]ults to the wife of his friend." He li[s]tened not to what I was [s]aying, but placing him[s]elf between me and the door, forcibly [s]eized my hands, and was proceeding to the mo[s]t romantic profe[s][s]ions of platonic love, when I [s]aw Mr. Rook[s]by coming up the walk. Agitated and di[s]tre[s][s]ed beyond mea[s]ure, I cried "cruel, per[s]ecuting Belger, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-451.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] you have exepo[s]ed me to the [s]u[s]picions of my hu[s]band, who mu[s]t [s]uppo[s]e a guilty a[s][s]ignation has been the cau[s]e of our being alone here at this late hour." I had not time to [s]ay more. Mr. Rook[s]by entered. "why, my dear Meriel" [s]aid he, "do you [s]tay out thus late expo[s]ing your[s]ef to the dews of the evening," then perceiving Belger, he added, "but you have company with you, and, perhaps, I intrude on an agreeable tete-a-tete ." I endeavoured to compo[s]e my agitated [s]pirits, and an[s]wer him in a [s]tyle of raillery; but it was impo[s][s]ible. I di[s]covered by the manner in which he [s]poke, that the unhappy jealou[s]y of his temper was awakened, and that it would not be an ea[s]y matter to convince him, his [s]u[s]picions were without foundation, I trembled, as I took hold of his arm; and we proceeded in [s]ilence to the hou[s]e. When we entered, my mother tenderly expre[s][s]ed her anxiety and fears of my having taken cold, Amelia too gently chid me for playing truant as [s]he called it. I do not know how I looked, but I am [s]ure I felt very di[s]agreeably. Indeed, the raillery of Amelia, the cold re[s]erve of Rook[s]by, and the humiliating glances of Belger [s]o powerfully affected my feelings; that I pleaded indi[s]po[s]ition and retired to my apartment, where I have given vent to my tears, and in [s]ome mea[s]ure ea[s]ed my heart, by relating the cau[s]e of my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-452.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] unea[s]ine[s]s to my friendly Celia. I fear, it will be long before Rook[s]by will again look on me with tenderne[s]s; and when I recollect, the manner of my leaving Mrs. Rook[s]by and Amelia, the length of time I was ab[s]ent, and my being found at [s]o late an hour in the [s]ummer hou[s]e with Belger, who no doubt had al[s]o been rambling about for [s]ome time, though we had but that moment met. All the[s]e circum[s]tances mu[s]t tend to make me appear guilty of impropriety, if not imprudence. Again and again I repeat it. Belger [s]eems doomed to be the bane of my happine[s]s. Amelia has ju[s]t been with me. I informed her of the cau[s]e I had for unea[s]ine[s]s. She blamed me for retiring [s]o early, [s]aying it gave me an appearance of con[s]cious guilt, though [s]he was fully [s]en[s]ible that every thought of my heart was purity it[s]elf; [s]he bade me a[s][s]ume an air of cheerfulne[s]s, as [s]he was afraid that the timid embarra[s][s]ment that mode[s]ty and real innocence ever di[s]covers, when glanced on by the eye of [s]u[s]picion, would only tend to encrea[s]e the doubts Rook[s]by already harboured. But I hear him coming. I mu[s]t quit my pen and retire to bed, though greatly I fear, not to re[s]t.

When Rook[s]by entered the apartment, a mixture of [s]orrow, anger and di[s]tre[s]s [s]at on his countenance.---"I thought, madam," [s]aid he, "you were indi[s]po[s]ed, as you retired [s]o early; but I [s]ee you are not in bed yet; but agreeable meditation is certainly more plea[s]ing, than the company of tho[s]e we dislike. Pray do not let me di[s]turb your reverie."--- "You [s]peak in riddles, Mr. Rook[s]by. Who[s]e company did you [s]uppo[s]e I fled from, when I left the parlour. Solitude, indeed, was more agreeable than to be in company, and witne[s]s the frown of di[s]plea[s]ure that [s]at on your countenance. It was not the headach impelled me to retire; it was a pain more acute."---I could not proceed, but laying my hand on my bo[s]om, the involuntary tear choaked my utterance. "My beloved Meriel, "[s]aid he, [s]itting down by me, and [s]peaking in a [s]oftened accent, "do not weep. Tho[s]e precious tears would melt a heart of adamant: think then, how much they mu[s]t di[s]tre[s]s one who glows with unutterable tenderne[s]s toward you." "Ah Rook[s]by, why, if you really experience [s]uch tender emotions in my favour, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-454.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] why have you wounded my heart, by uttering [s]uch unkind, I may [s]ay, cruel [s]u[s]picions." "Meriel", [s]aid he, looking at me intently, "did you not confe[s]s you knew Belger [s]ome time [s]ince at Ken[s]ington." "Mo[s]t a[s][s]uredly, I did." "And during the time of your acquaintance there, did he never expre[s]s his admiration--- his e[s]teem---his love to you." "How can you a[s]k [s]uch a que[s]tion? He was at that time"--- "Married, you would [s]ay," cried he, interrupting me, "but I know he was not, and I remember hearing him once [s]peak of a beautiful creature, he knew at that place, who had more power over his heart than all the re[s]t of the [s]ex put together." "And therefore, it follows," [s]aid I, "that I mu[s]t be the per[s]on he meant (attempting a [s]mile.) My dear Rook[s]by, if you have [s]uch an opinion of your Meriel's attractions, [s]he has a far more humble one of her[s]elf." "But you had certainly been indulging him, this evening, with a long tete-a-tete ."

"There is [s]uch an ingenuous frankne[s]s in your manner, dear girl, that it would be almo[s]t a crime to doubt of your [s]incerity. Yet when I reflect"--- In [s]aying this, he [s]tarted up and [s]triking his forehead with his hand, he cried, "the[s]e doubts will un[s]ettle my rea[s]on"---I was terrified, and ri[s]ing from my [s]eat endeavoured to [s]ooth him. He took my hand and pressing it to his lips, [s]aid, "I cannot credit aught to your di[s]advantage. Your countenance is [s]o expre[s][s]ive of innocence, that it is impo[s][s]ible to believe you otherwi[s]e. Forgive my ungenerous conduct. It is the fault of my nature. Forget it, and I will be careful how I offend again." You may be [s]ure, I was not backward in promi[s]ing a total forgetfulness of this painful event: but I am [s]en[s]ible, my dear Celia, it is impo[s][s]ible to keep my promi[s]e, for though we all met this morning in the [s]ame [s]ocial manner as u[s]ual, I felt [s]uch a re[s]traint upon my[s]elf whenever Belger addre[s][s]ed me, and an[s]wered the mo[s]t trifling que[s]tions with [s]uch evident imbarassment, that to even an indifferent [s]pectator I mu[s]t have appeared [s]trangely agitated.

If I had informed him of Belger's unprincipled behaviour to me at that place he might not have renewed his intimacy, but I always have an objection to relating any tale whereof I am my[s]elf the heroine, and in this point I avoided it, fearing to incur the imputation of vanity, and in [s]o doing, I have incurred that of guilt.---To mention the[s]e circum[s]tances now would be impo[s][s]ible, as it would only tend to confirm Rook[s]by's [s]u[s]picions, perhaps engage him in a quarrel with Belger and by making it a public affair, ca[s]t a blemi[s]h on my reputation, which no future conduct will ever wipe off. But I think through the whole cour[s]e of my life I have been particularly unfortunate in having my mo[s]t innocent actions mi[s]con[s]trued, and though my own bo[s]om conceals not a wi[s]h which does not tend to the univer[s]al happine[s]s of mankind in general. I have never wanted enemies, who are ever ready to catch at the errors, to which frail mortality is liable; and magnify them into crimes.---I have however a [s]weet con[s]olation Celia. My heart is con[s]cious of its own integrity and relies on that Power, who knows its innocence to support it through every trial, which in His wisdom He may [s]ee proper to lay upon it. This [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-457.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] is a con[s]olation of which no afflicton, however [s]evere, can rob me. Mrs. Rook[s]by is I fear, in a declining [s]tate of health. Age and its attendant infirmities bend her frame to the earth; but her mind is [s]till in full vigour. She is the [s]ame pious, re[s]igned chearful chri[s]tian, as ever: and her company is equally [s]ought by the young as well as by tho[s]e more nearly of her own years. A journey to the [s]outh of France is judged nece[s][s]ary for her the en[s]uing winter. Mr. Rook[s]by does not wi[s]h to leave England; [s]o I have not hinted my de[s]ire of accompanying her. Indeed, my pre[s]ent [s]ituation would render travelling dangerous, Amelia goes with her, and I mean to invite Su[s]an Mo[s][s]op to [s]pend the winter with me in town, not that I expect to reap much plea[s]ure from her [s]ociety; but I think a re[s]idence in my family may be of [s]ervice to her; and [s]hould any proper match offer, the want of a fortune [s]hall not be an ob[s]tacle, Adieu my friend, your's ever.

From the time of my la[s]t letter, Mrs. Rook[s]by's health has evidently become wor[s]e and wor[s]e every day; [s]o that we were obliged to ha[s]ten her departure for the continent, as the phy[s]icians feared the cold autumnal bla[s]ts would be too much for her enervated frame to bear. We were bu[s]y in preparing for her departure, when one evening ju[s]t as the [s]un was [s]et, a little girl came and informed me a poor tenant of our's was taken [s]uddenly ill, and wi[s]hed very much to [s]ee me.---As Amelia was bu[s]y in her own apartment, I would not interrupt her to reque[s]t her company; but taking [s]ome cordials with me and bidding Thomas follow, I took hold of the little girl and bid her lead me to the cottage. When I arrived the poor woman told me [s]he had been [s]eized with a [s]udden fit, and imagining her[s]elf dying---[s]he had [s]ent for me to recommend her children to my care; but as [s]he now found her[s]elf much better, [s]he humbly hoped I would pardon the trouble [s]he had given me. As I had walked very quick, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-460.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] found my[s]elf [s]omewhat fatigued and [s]at down for a few moments to re[s]t. Whil[s]t I [s]at, I bu[s]ied my[s]elf in making enquiries concerning the poor woman's family, and learnt that [s]he had [s]even children and a very bad hu[s]band.---"I have been in a deal of trouble, madam," [s]aid [s]he, "Robin has been very idle this [s]ummer and had gotten him[s]elf in debt; but we were relieved from our nece[s][s]ities by a gentleman, who is I believe, at the Hall; for the children [s]ay they have [s]een him there. Oh! madam, he has been the pre[s]erver of me and mine, and I am bound to pray for his pro[s]perity." She was eagerly proceeding, when ca[s]ting my eye toward the window, I [s]aw Belger open the wicket, which [s]erved for a gate, and come in.---"Here is your benefactor coming good woman" [s]aid I, and [s]lipping two guineas into her hand, went toward the door, but was not quick enough to e[s]cape, before Belger entered.---"Ble[s]s me my fair hostess," [s]aid he, in an accent of [s]urpri[s]e; "who could have thought of [s]eeing you here; not that it is [s]urpri[s]ing to [s]ee Mrs. Rook[s]by in the cottage of poverty [s]weetly alleviating its attendant evils, but the latene[s]s of the hour and to [s]ee her without Mi[s]s Sidney." "Amelia was engaged," [s]aid I endeavouring to pa[s]s him, "and indeed, I did not ob[s]erve how late it was."--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-461.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] "You will permit me to [s]ee you home?" "By no means Mr. Belger. I have my [s]ervant with me." "Do not, deare[s]t madam, deny me the [s]elicity of walking by your [s]ide and enjoying a few moments uninterrupted conver[s]ation, a ble[s][s]ing I cannot obtain at the hall." "Nor can I think, [s]ir, you have any thing to [s]ay to me, to which the whole world might not be a witne[s]s, I de[s]ire you will [s]uffer me to go home alone. I have particular rea[s]ons."

As to errors I neither [s]u[s]pect him capable of any; derogatory to his own honour or prejudicial to our mutual happiness; and know, [s]ir, the per[s]on who would endeavour to awaken [s]u[s]picion in my bo[s]om, will be ever held as an object of contempt and dete[s]tation."

From the in[s]tant Belger fir[s]t entered, the woman had from a motive of re[s]pect left the room, and my [s]ervant was without [s]ide the gate, waiting for my coming out. I was he[s]itating for an an[s]wer, by which I might hope to make him relinqui[s]h his design; when I heard my hu[s]band's voice enquiring of the [s]ervant, "whom he was waiting for?" "My mi[s]ere[s]s, [s]ir," replied the man. "Your mi[s]tre[s]s is here then---and who is with her?" "Mr. Belger went in a few moments [s]ince." "Damnation!" exclaimed he, and pushing by the man with violence in[s]tantly ru[s]hed into the hou[s]e.

But, this is no time for argument; tell me, thou vile reptile, who under the ma[s]k of friend[s]hip ha[s]t di[s]honoured me, what reparation can you make for the peace you have de[s]troyed, for the purity you have fullied?--- "Dear Rook[s]by," ([s]aid Belger in a tone of di[s][s]embling gentlene[s]s,) "you are carried away by a wild ungovernable pa[s][s]ion, I give you my honour I had not been in the hou[s]e ten minutes when you entered; nor had I the mo[s]t di[s]tant idea of meeting Mrs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-464.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] Rooksby here, you iujure her by the[s]e unju[s]t suspicions, and what ought to be at this time a material con[s]ideration, you agitate her [s]pirits, impair her health and endanger her valuable life."--- "Belger" [s]aid my hu[s]band, with a voice that made me tremble, "you are both a coward and a villain."

And in the ca[s]e of duelling vanqui[s]h or be vanqui[s]hed, you are equally a murderer. Go, leave us, would to heaven, I could [s]ay to that peace which was uninterrupted, till your arrival here.---Return to London, or go any where; [s]o as I may not have the weight of blood[s]hed to drag my almo[s]t broken [s]pirit to the earth. Rook[s]by [s]tarted up with fury and snatching my hand from off Belger's arm, cried--- "by heavens you tremble only for him. So as he is [s]afe you care not what becomes of me. But come, madam, let us return, it is almo[s]t dark." As he [s]aid this, he pulled me redely from my [s]eat. I attempted to walk; but terror had unnerved my limbs. I [s]unk down again on the chair, and had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-466.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] not a flood of tears relieved me, I mu[s]t have fainted. He was alarmed and called the woman to bring [s]ome water, and [s]aying he would [s]end the carriage to fetch me as I was unable to walk,---he went out, followed by Belger in [s]ullen [s]ilence. When he was gone, my agitation became [s]o great, it threw me almo[s]t into hy[s]terics. I was not sufficiently mi[s]tre[s]s of my recollection to a[s]k the woman any que[s]tions, but gave vent to my overcharged heart in a torrent of unrestrained affliction, and when the carriage arrived, threw my[s]elf into it alma[s]t di[s]tracted with the violence of my emotions, where, to my great comfort, I found my kind [s]oothing friend Amelia. I related to her what had ju[s]t happened; [s]he comforted me all that lay in her power, and told me Belger had retired to his apartment immediately on entering the hou[s]e, and that Rook[s]by went to the library, where he was bu[s]y writing. She [s]aid [s]he would endeavour to [s]ee the former before [s]he went to re[s]t, and per[s]uade him to [s]et off for London, entreated me to hide my unea[s]ine[s]s from Mrs. Rook[s]by, as her weak [s]tate of health would but ill support the [s]hock of [s]uch intelligence, when [s]he [s]uppo[s]ed us the happie[s]t of the hymenial votaries, and lamented her being obliged to leave me in [s]o di[s]agreeable a [s]ituation.

And [s]o I will, my dear Celia; for have I not con[s]cious innocence for my [s]upport, and is it not my duty to [s]ubmit without repining, to the will of Him, who never lays on his creatures the rod of affliction but for [s]ome wife purpo[s]e. He can humble the frail body to the du[s]t the more to exalt the [s]oul. He can cau[s]e the bones that he has broken to rejoice, and heal the broken heart. I feel his mercies at this moment abound in the comforts of an approving con[s]cience. I acknowledge his judgments ju[s]t, and pray only for meekne[s]s and re[s]ignation to bear his di[s]pen[s]ations as I ought.

The morning after the di[s]agreeable rencounter mentioned in my la[s]t, I found my[s]elf much indi[s]po[s]ed; but as it was the day intended for Mrs. Rook[s]by's departure, I aro[s]e at the u[s]ual time and endeavoured to appear as chearful as po[s][s]ible, that the dear old lady might not perceive the di[s]tre[s]s of my mind.

It was with infinite plea[s]ure I learnt that Belger had [s]et out for town long before any of the family were [s]tirring, leaving only a card to my mother pleading urgent bu[s]ine[s]s as his excu[s]e for [s]o precipitate a departure, and wi[s]hing her intended journey might have the de[s]ired [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-469.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] effect and re[s]tore her to perfect health. At twelve o'clock the chariot drew up to the door---I felt my [s]pirits [s]ink. I looked fir[s]t at my dear Amelia, then at my mother, and taking a hand from each, pre[s][s]ed them to my heart and bur[s]t into tears. It was in vain any longer to hide my [s]orrows---I [s]aw the[s]e invaluable friends departing from me at the very moment when I mo[s]t wanted their [s]oothing attentions. I looked on my generous benefactre[s]s, perhaps, for the la[s]t time. Her wan cheek and emaciated frame, too plainly announced her approaching dissolution. I threw my arms round her---I endeavoured to articulate an adieu---but words were denied me.---"God ble[s]s you, my dear child," [s]aid [s]he. "Clement, be tender of her---comfort her---[s]tudy her felicity---and may Heaven [s]hower its choice[s]t ble[s][s]ings on you both." She then took up my little Clementina, and letting fall a tear as [s]he pre[s][s]ed the [s]miling Cherub to her bo[s]om, cried emphatically, "Oh thou [s]weet angel! Heaven grant that you may live to be an honour to your father and a ble[s][s]ing to your mother---maye[s]t thou be endowed with all her virtues without any of his faults." She then once more embraced me and went to the carriage. Amelia [s]tayed behind a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-470.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] moment to comfort and re-a[s][s]ure me. She bid me keep up my [s]pirits and tru[s]t in that Power for [s]upport, who never yet for[s]ook the innocent. Rook[s]by accompanied them [s]ome miles on hor[s]e back. I followed the chariot with my eyes as long as I could, and then retiring to my chamber, threw my[s]elf on the bed, and gave a loo[s]e to unutterable [s]orrow. However the [s]pirit may be afflicted, nature exhau[s]ted by various conflicts will in[s]en[s]ibly [s]ink under the balmy influence of [s]leep.--- This was my ca[s]e: I [s]lept about two hours, but awoke unrefre[s]hed, and in acute pain. My head ached, my tongue was parched, and I had every [s]ymptom of an approaching fever. However I endeavoured to ri[s]e and dre[s]s, to be ready to receive Rook[s]by, as he propo[s]ed returning to dinner: but to this ta[s]k I was unequal. My head was giddy and my limbs trembled. He[s]ter, my woman, was alarmed. She rang for the hou[s]e-maid, who ju[s]t came in time to help to [s]upport me; for in attempting to go from my bedchamber to the dre[s][s]ing-room, I had fainted. On recovering, I found much wor[s]e consequences were to be apprechended, than I had at fir[s]t imagined. I [s]ent immediately for medical a[s][s]i[s]tance and about four o'clock the next morning, I was delivered of a dead [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-471.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] child. For [s]ome hours I was totally insenble, and for more than a week my life was de[s]paired of. Rook[s]by was frequent in his enquiries after my health; but I could plainly perceive, he thought more of the lo[s]s of his [s]on than my evidently dangerous situation. However it plea[s]ed Heaven to re[s]tore me, though by [s]low degrees, and the moment the phy[s]icians pronounced me able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I [s]et off for London, vainly hoping that variety of [s]cenes, company and public amu[s]ements would restore in [s]ome mea[s]ure my lo[s]t chearfulne[s]s; at lea[s]t I thought it would bani[s]h tho[s]e corroding reflections which gnawed and goaded my poor lacerated heart. Oh! my beloved Celia, Rook[s]by no longer retains the smallest degree of affection for me. In company he is polite, but di[s]tant; when by our[s]elves (which is indeed but [s]eldom) he is cold, unkind, and my Celia will hardly believe it, he once on my gently remon[s]trating on this painful change, [s]truck me, nay cur[s]ed me, and called me by a name, my [s]oul [s]hudders to think on. That he hates and de[s]pi[s]es the woman he once doated on is now become too evident to be doubted; for he has never returned to my apartment [s]ince my illne[s]s, but occupies one in another part of the hou[s]e. Su[s]an Mo[s][s]op is with me. She is po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of more tenderne[s]s and goodne[s]s of heart [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-472.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] than I at fir[s]t [s]u[s]pected. She labours incesantly to amu[s]e me, and though I cannot partake of her chearfulne[s]s, I am grateful for her attention. He[s]ter is married to a man of genteel fortune, but from what I can judge of the character of both, I think they will pa[s]s that kind of in[s]ipid life [s]o well described by Prior in his epitaph on [s]auntering Jack and idle Joan. Nor wi[s]hed, nor cared, nor laughed nor cried, And [s]o they lived, and [s]o they died. I am ju[s]t returned from an airing in Hyde Park, and have been greatly a[s]toni[s]hed to [s]ee Clara there, whom I left in Devon[s]hire. She was on hor[s]e-back, elegantly mounted and attended by a [s]ervant in livery. A confused idea ran through my mind, when I fir[s]t [s]aw her, yet [s]urely [s]he can never add ingratitude to infamy, by [s]educing the affections of the hu[s]band, when [s]he has been re[s]cued from want and mi[s]ery by the wife, yet, what can have brought her to town, or how is it po[s][s]ible [s]he can afford to appear in the manner ju[s]t de[s]cribed.--- I am [s]atisfied Rook[s]by mu[s]t [s]till hold [s]ome intercour[s]e with Clara. We have ju[s]t had a tete-a-tete in which he accu[s]ed me of deceiving him, of giving him my hand when [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-473.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] my heart was devoted to another; and of having been long acquainted with Belger, with whom it was well known, I had an illicit intercour[s]e. Deare[s]t Celia, imagine the agonizing feelings of my heart on being [s]ubject to [s]uch unju[s]t, [s]uch cruel [s]u[s]picions. It was in vain I attempted to a[s][s]ert my innocence; he was well informed, he [s]aid, of every incident that had pa[s][s]ed during my re[s]idence at Ken[s]ington; that I had been the intimate acquaintance of women of light characters; that my own conduct in regard to Belger was notoriou[s]ly infamous, and that I was in reality the exact rever[s]e of what I had speciously appeared to his mother, or [s]he never would [s]o [s]trenuou[s]ly have pre[s][s]ed our union. Oh! my friend, would to heaven, I had trusted to the dictates of my own judgment, had been guided by the impul[s]e of my heart which [s]trongly urged me to reject this man; but compa[s][s]ion, gratitude, and the combined wi[s]hes of tho[s]e whom I mo[s]t loved and respected, operated [s]o powerfully on my feelings, that I was unable to with[s]tand their [s]olicitations; and Heaven be my witne[s]s, I have not in one in[s]tance [s]ince I have been united to Rook[s]by infringed the [s]malle[s]t duty incumbent on the [s]acred character of wife. A letter---it is from Amelia, Heaven grant no ill news.---Read it Celia, I inclo[s]e it for your peru[s]al, and wonder not that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-474.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] my fa[s]t [s]alling tears oblige me to bid you adieu!--- MERIEL. AMELIA to MERIEL. -  Aix-la-Chapelle Nov. 9 th , 1783. It is with infinite regret, I take up my pen to inform my dear friend, that the flattering appearance of Mrs. Rook[s]by's returning health, which had [s]o elated my spirits are entirely vani[s]hed, and an encrea[s]ing debility of frame, baffles all the [s]kill of the phy[s]icians and alarms us to an imminent degree. My mind is in [s]uch a [s]tate of painful anxiety, that I hardly know what I write. When I am pre[s]ent with the dear invalid, I endeavour to command my feelings and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-475.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] appear chearful, but the effort is vain, and when I contemplate her pale, yet placid countenance, the tears will involuntarily bur[s]t from my eyes. She, this morning, observing my emotions, called me to the bed[s]ide, (from which [s]he is now [s]carcely able to ri[s]e, even while it is making) and taking my hand, "my dear Mi[s]s Sidney," [s]aid [s]he, "do not let my approaching di[s][s]olution give you pain.---I [s]ee it draw near with no other apprehen[s]ion than what frail mortality mu[s]t feel, when called from a temporal to an eternal [s]tate, into the immediate pre[s]ence of the Creator of the Univer[s]e!---I have had my [s]pan lengthened out far beyond what I had ever expected.---I feel no regret at leaving this tran[s]itory life;---for my only care was centered in the happine[s]s of my [s]on, and him I [s]hall leave happy in the affection of the be[s]t, the worthie[s]t of her [s]ex. I know my beloved Meriel will feel my lo[s]s: But time will mitigate her affliction and [s]he will bear it with the fortitude of a chri[s]tian. I have one thing to mention, which nearly concerns your happine[s]s. I have a nephew here whom you have [s]een---Captain On[s]low is a man every way worthy the e[s]teem of a woman of [s]en[s]e. He is not in[s]en[s]ible to the merit of Mi[s]s Sidney, and has reque[s]ted me to plead his cau[s]e. I flatter my[s]elf you will not refu[s]e his [s]uit."---She pau[s]ed. I was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-476.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] [s]ilent. I had frequently [s]een and admired Captain On[s]low: he is in the Ea[s]t-India [s]ervice; for though a man of fortune, he prefers a life of activity to one of [s]upine indolence. An indifferent [s]tate of health, brought him to Aix-la-Chapelle; but being now perfectly recovered, he propo[s]ed rejoining his regiment, which it is expected will be ordered to Bengal the en[s]uing [s]ea[s]on. I [s]hould not be thus particular, but knowing from [s]ome di[s]agreement between Mr. Rook[s]by and the Captain, you were totally ignorant that you had [s]uch a relation, and therefore might wi[s]h [s]ome information. I had without vanity rea[s]on to [s]u[s]pect the Captain[s]s partiality; nor can I with truth a[s][s]ert, that my bo[s]om felt that indifference toward him, which it had ever maintained toward the re[s]t of his [s]ex. Yet Mrs. Rooksby taking me at a moment [s]o unprepared, I he[s]itated, and knew not what to an[s]wer. She [s]aw my confu[s]ion and then continued, "I have in my will left you a [s]mall token of my regard, which if you li[s]ten to On[s]low's [s]uit, I [s]hall in[s]i[s]t on [s]eeing [s]ettled on yourself, if it is not painful, my dear Amelia, I could wi[s]h to hear your candid sentiments on this [s]ubject, and it would give me infinite [s]atisfaction to [s]ee you united to [s]o worthy a man before I breathe my la[s]t; as the welfare of every one dear to my charming [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-477.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] daughter-in-law mu[s]t ever intere[s]t my fonde[s]t [s]olicitude." I thanked the generous woman in terms of heartfelt gratitude, a[s][s]ured her I was perfectly happy in my pre[s]ent [s]ituation, but that if it was my fate to change, I knew of no per[s]on I [s]hould prefer to Captain Onslow. My only objection would be the difference [s]ub[s]i[s]ting between him and Mr. Rook[s]by, as I feared it would prevent that [s]ocial intercour[s]e that I mu[s]t ever wi[s]h to continue uninterrupted between Mrs. Rooksby and my[s]elf. "I will obviate that objection my dear," [s]aid [s]he, "for it [s]hall be my la[s]t reque[s]t to Clement that all animo[s]ity be laid a[s]ide, as he values my ble[s][s]ing. And now," continued [s]he, with a faint [s]mile, "there remains nothing to be done but for you to take your pen and bid my [s]on and his amiable wife to your nuptials. The jaunt will be of [s]ervice to Meriel after her late illne[s]s, and [s]he will have the double pleasure of [s]eeing her beloved friend enter into an honourable and happy marriage, and me into a [s]tate of everla[s]ting bli[s]s; and tell her from me [s]he [s]hould celebrate the two events as equally joyful." "Oh! my dear madam, [s]aid I," in an agony of grief, "do not talk thus, I hope you will recover."--- "Impo[s][s]ible," [s]aid [s]he, waving her hand with a [s]olemn yet benignant look, "I have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-478.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] enquired of the phy[s]icians how long they [s]uppo[s]e I can remain. They informed me, ye[s]terday, I may po[s][s]ibly continue three weeks or a month longer; but that is the utmo[s]t; therefore my dear Amelia, lo[s]e no time. I could wi[s]h to [s]ee my dear children once more, and I am certain the bare mention of that wi[s]h will be [s]ufficient to bring them eagerly to me." Thus, my dear Meriel, have I executed the de[s]ire of my almo[s]t expiring benefactre[s]s; ha[s]ten to me my friend that we may pour our affliction into each others bo[s]om, and by participation lighten the burthen that will pre[s]s [s]o heavy on our hearts. I flatter myself the death-bed of an amiable and re[s]pected parent will have a good effect on the mind of your unkind truant, and bring him back to a [s]en[s]e of the happine[s]s he is wantonly trifling away. I tru[s]t you will u[s]e all po[s][s]ible expedition. I have agreable to Mrs. Rook[s]by's de[s]ire wrote to her [s]on reque[s]ting his immediate acquie[s]cence with her wi[s]h. Oh! my dear Meriel, my mind is [s]orely oppre[s][s]ed, I [s]hrink from the thought of uniting my[s]elf to Captain On[s]low at the very moment, when tears of real [s]orrow will dim the lu[s]tre of the hymenial torch: but your better judgment [s]hall in this and every particular direct that of your AMELIA SIDNEY. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Paris January 29 th , 1784. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-479.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] From this great theatre of di[s][s]ipation and folly does Meriel once more addre[s]s her friend--- but why am I not permitted to [s]ee you? why in the [s]ame kingdom does indi[s]pen[s]ible duties keep me from flying to you, and in your peaceful cloi[s]ter burying my[s]elf at once from the world and all its [s]orrows? Alas I too plainly feel that even there I could not now be at peace: for thither [s]hould I carry corroding thought, the pangs of di[s]appointed love, the remembrance of abu[s]ed confidence, ingratitude and ill requited friend[s]hip.--- Strange [s]cenes have pa[s][s]ed, my friend, [s]ince I wrote you la[s]t; I have hovered on the brink of eternity, from whence I was only [s]natched to be the victim of future mi[s]ery; but let me pur[s]ue [s]ome method in my narrative and carry you back to the time when the receipt of Amelia's letter hurried us to proceed as expeditiou[s]ly as po[s][s]ible to Aix to catch [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-480.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] the parting [s]igh and receive the dying blessing of my la[s]t dear parent, my more than mother. Every preparation nece[s][s]ary for our departure was [s]oon made, when the evening previous to the day on which we were to [s]et out, Rook[s]by came into my dre[s][s]ing room, where I was bu[s]y in making [s]ome necessary arrangements with the hou[s]ekeeper, and bidding her quit the room [s]at down beside me, and looking with more complacency than he had lately done, when addre[s][s]ing me, [s]aid, "I have unknown to you Meriel made a little addition to our party to the continent, and flatter my[s]elf it will not be di[s]agreeable."---I believe I looked [s]urprized when I replied, "had our journey been one of plea[s]ure I could certainly have no objection to any per[s]on, whom he [s]hould think proper to join us, but on [s]o mournful an occasion I mu[s]t [s]uppo[s]e the pre[s]ence of a stranger"--- "It is not a [s]tranger," [s]aid he (interrupting me eagerly,) "it is poor Clara." "Clara, [s]ir?" in a tone of angry [s]urprize. "Yes, my dear," he an[s]wered he[s]itatingly, "She is in a bad [s]tate of health; I met her lately by accident. She cannot well afford [s]o long a journey; and it is a good opportunity." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-481.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] "Rook[s]by [s]aid I," fixing my eyes upon his face: I think you know me well enough to be certain that if Clara is really ill and in want, [s]he has a claim to every tender office of humanity from me as a fellow-creature, but"--- "Nay, Meriel, no buts: [s]urely (affecting a [s]mile) "you are not jealous?"---"No, [s]ir, you may re[s]t quite ea[s]y on that head. I cannot think [s]o meanly of you as to [s]uppo[s]e after what had pa[s][s]ed you would again be the dupe of an artful woman; for however my compa[s][s]ion may have been awakened toward Clara, I cannot help thinking her a woman capable of the ba[s]e[s]t duplicity." "She is going to be married to Belger," [s]aid he, endeavoring to hide his evident embarrassment under the ma[s]k of carele[s][s]ne[s]s. "But I hope, [s]ir, he is not to join us!" [s]aid I, reddening with indignation at the remembrance of pa[s]t injuries, which I could now trace to their right [s]ource. "No, he will follow Clara to Aix, and if my mother dies, we [s]hall all [s]pend the winter in Paris." The evident compo[s]ure with which he mentioned [s]uch an afflicting circum[s]tance, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-482.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] cut me to the [s]oul.---"You [s]peak of your mother with great indifference," [s]aid I, and the tears gu[s]hed from my eyes. "Indifference, no, indeed I am extremely [s]orry; but you know, my dear, [s]he is an old woman, and we mu[s]t expect it, and that you know prepares us for the [s]troke, and prevents the [s]hock we [s]hould otherwi[s]e feel. I have been thinking," continued he after a little pau[s]e, "that I [s]hall have the Hall pulled down next [s]ummer and built in a more modern [s]tile." I turned from him with [s]ilent contempt and re[s]ting my cheek upon my hand gave a loo[s]e to melancholy reflections. Celia I have been deceived in this man. He has no heart, no [s]en[s]ibility; every feeling of his [s]oul is ab[s]orbed in [s]elf. Why, why was my fate united to [s]uch a man. I was rou[s]ed from my reverie by a loud knock at the door.--- "That is Clara," [s]aid he, [s]tarting up. "I de[s]ired [s]he would [s]leep here, that we might be ready to [s]et off together in the morning." I felt a faint chillne[s]s [s]eize me as he [s]poke. I believe my voice faultered as I [s]aid, go down then and receive her; I will ju[s]t take one more look at my dear little girl and join you immediately." When he had left the room I [s]unk motionle[s]s the [s]opha. "Good heaven," [s]aid I, "and is it come to this. Can [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-483.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] it be po[s][s]ible, that the man whom I have promised to love and honour [s]hould thus forget what is due to me, to his child and to himself? But I will not judge too ra[s]hly, continued I, ri[s]ing and drying my eyes. Perhaps they may not be guilty. Jealou[s]y magnifies every object, and con[s]trues even laudable actions into crimes." I then vi[s]ited the nursery and having pa[s][s]ed a few minutes in caressing my little Clementina, I de[s]cended to the drawing room where I found Clara negligently [s]eated on a [s]opha by Rook[s]by, and Su[s]an Mo[s][s]op playing on the Piano Forte. Clara ro[s]e from her [s]eat, coloured and he[s]itatingly [s]aid [s]omething about intru[s]ion. I confe[s]s I was not le[s]s embarra[s][s]ed my[s]elf; however I paid her the civilities nece[s][s]ary as being my gue[s]t and we immediately went to [s]upper, [s]oon after which I retired on pretence of making [s]ome further preparations, and having given orders about an apartment for Clara, I [s]at down and wrote a few lines to Su[s]an requesting, as [s]he intended [s]taying in town, till [s]he heared from us the re[s]ult of our voyage and whether we returned or pa[s]t the winter on the continent, that [s]he would be particularly attentive to the child, and in ca[s]e of her father's [s]ending for her begged [s]he would accompany her to Paris. This I did by letter, being [s]en[s]ible I [s]hould have no time to [s]peak to her in the morning; and I did not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-484.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] think proper to [s]end for her up [s]tairs at that time. Early in the morning our po[s]t coach was at the door, and by [s]ix o'clock Mr. Rook[s]by, Clara, my[s]elf and Le[s]ter my woman were [s]eated in it; and we proceeded with all imaginable [s]peed to Dover. Rook[s]by immediately on our arrival [s]ent to [s]peak to the ma[s]ter of a Packet. We found it was impo[s][s]ible to think of embarking till the next morning, and were informed by the man that a gentleman and lady ju[s]t arrived from town had taken their pa[s][s]age on board his ve[s][s]el. While we continued talking, a gentle tap at the door interrupted us, and on its being opened who [s]hould enter but Mrs. Kingly. It was a mo[s]t agreeable [s]urprize to me, though I believe not [s]o to Rook[s]by. "Well met my dear cou[s]in," [s]aid [s]he, affectionately [s]aluting me, "it is fortunate that we [s]hould both be travelling the [s]ame way. I [s]aw your livery in the yard and immediately made my enquiries." Kingly is gone out, [s]o you [s]ee I took the opportunity and eloped to you; but when he returns I am [s]ure he will be as happy as my[s]elf to pay you his re[s]pects." While [s]he was [s]peaking [s]he did not notice who was in the room, and, indeed, Clara [s]at in an ob[s]cure corner by the fire, but as [s]he fini[s]hed the la[s]t [s]entence, turning ha[s]tily round [s]he [s]aw her; but not recognizing her immediately cried, "I fear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-485.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] I am guilty of rudene[s]s, you have company."--- "No one particular," [s]aid I. It is only Mrs. Moreton." Clara was now under the nece[s][s]ity of ri[s]ing; Mrs. Kingly [s]tarted and curt[s]ying formally, while [s]he gave Rook[s]by a mo[s]t expre[s][s]ive look, [s]aid [s]he could not have expected to [s]ee Mrs. Moreton in this party, not knowing we were acquainted. I really felt for Clara; her colour varied from red to pale and from pale to red, till I thought [s]he would have [s]unk. Rook[s]by looked mortified, and I only [s]lightly [s]aid, that Mrs. Moreton having but indifferent health wi[s]hed to try the air and weather of Aix, and we having an empty [s]eat in the coach I had offered it to her.--- Mrs. Kingly looked inqui[s]itive, as much as to [s]ay, "do you know who [s]he is." But [s]he repre[s][s]ed the impul[s]e of curio[s]ity and made enquiries after my dear mother, whom [s]he did not know till then, was in [s]o dangerous a [s]tate. In about an hour Kingly came in, when after the fir[s]t [s]alutations were pa[s]t, he began to recognize Clara, I think it would be impo[s][s]ible to give you an adequate idea of the anger and contempt that agitated his expre[s][s]ive countenance, her pre[s]ence was a re[s]traint upon us all, it checked conversation, we were for [s]ome moments [s]ilent and embarra[s][s]ed---[s]he [s]aw it and gue[s][s]ing the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-486.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] cau[s]e, complained of weakne[s]s and fatigue and ringing for a light retired to her chamber. She was no [s]ooner gone than Kingly cried "why Mrs. Rook[s]by, how long have you been acquainted with that woman." "Some time," I replied affecting as much ea[s]e as po[s][s]ible. "Had you any knowledge of her before you were married?" "O yes, I knew her very well; come I know what you would [s]ay, but I [s]hall [s]top you at once; her former errors are nothing to me; at pre[s]ent [s]he is in di[s]tre[s]s. It was in my power to render her a trifling [s]ervice, and I only followed the dictates of humanity." "Neglecting tho[s]e of common prudence," interrupted he tartly. "P[s]haw! non[s]en[s]e," I replied laughing, "do not let us talk any more about her." "You are the mo[s]t unaccountable woman," [s]aid he, "that ever exi[s]ted, I declare [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-487.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] if almo[s]t half your life is not an inexplicable riddle." "My dear," [s]aid Mrs. Kingly, to turn the conver[s]ation, "my cou[s]ins have taken their pa[s][s]age in the [s]ame packet with us; [s]o we [s]hall cro[s]s the channel together." This had the de[s]ired effect; we in[s]en[s]ibly fell into mutual enquiries concerning the motives of our intended voyage: the conver[s]ation became by degrees cheerful, and Clara was for the moment forgot. I found that Mr. and Mrs. Kingly were merely on a jaunt of pleasure, and that we [s]hould have their company no farther than Calais, as they intended to proceed to Bru[s][s]els. But, my dear Celia, vain are the appointments of man; we look forward to many coming years, we mark out plans of future plea[s]ure and enjoyment: and cry, Thus we will do, and thus. When suddenly the unexpected bla[s]ts of adver[s]ity pa[s]s over us, the beauteous vi[s]ion fades before our [s]ight, while darkne[s]s clouds and tempe[s]t [s]hut the expected joys forever from our view, and hurl them far beyond our reach. Like [s]ome poor hind, who during the fatigues of the day, had looked often wi[s]hfully toward a di[s]tant [s]hady grove, where he might repo[s]e from the [s]corching noon-day [s]un.--- "When my daily ta[s]k is ended," [s]ays he, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-488.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] "I will retire there, and as I re[s]t my weary limbs, enjoy the cool refre[s]hing breezes as they pa[s]s over the banks of flowers." The[s]e reflections [s]weeten his toil, and he ta[s]tes a thou[s]and times by anticipation the plea[s]ures he expects to enjoy. At length the hour arrives, he quits his labour and ha[s]tily flies to the [s]cene of fancy, promi[s]ed bli[s]s. "How delightful is the cooling [s]hade," he cries, as he draws near the grove; "how charming the gurgling of the clear [s]tream that glides over the pebbles and falls into a ba[s]on formed by nature; how delicious the fruit that hangs from the trees and courts the hand to gather them. Oh! I could live and die in [s]o [s]weet a place. How happy I [s]hall be, when I reach it, and [s]tretch my weary limbs on the [s]oft gra[s][s]y turf."---Alas! poor [s]wain, do[s]t thou not [s]ee the [s]un is [s]unk beneath the hills, the gloom of evening comes on apace, and e'er thou can[s]t reach thy de[s]ired haven, the clouds of night will ob[s]cure its beauties from thy view, and the chilly dews prevent your taking the repo[s]e you [s]o ardently wi[s]h for. My dear Celia, I am at pre[s]ent unable to proceed; when I recover my [s]pirits, I will again re[s]ume my pen, till then farewel. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION. -  Paris January 30, 1784. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-489.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] We pa[s][s]ed the night as propo[s]ed at Dover, and at an early hour were called to go on board the packet, the wind and tide both favouring us. We embarked before it was well light, and the wind fre[s]hening as we proceeded we were [s]oon obliged to retire to our cabins, being [s]eized with the [s]ickne[s]s incident to tho[s]e, who are unu[s]ed to the boi[s]terous element.---For [s]ome time we were too ill to pay much attention to the motion of the ve[s][s]el, but at length I thought it was very violent, and enquired of Kingly, if it was u[s]ual to be [s]o much to[s][s]ed about in cro[s][s]ing the channel; his reply alarmed me; "the wind is changed," [s]aid he, "and the clouds threathen a boi[s]terous day; we [s]hall make good [s]ailors of you all, for I do not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-490.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] think you will reach Calais to-day, at lea[s]t not till late in the evening." Soon after this the wind increa[s]ed to a tremendous degree, and I [s]aw by Kingly's countenance that he was unea[s]y. He went frequently upon deck; then returned to the cabin, endeavoured to chear us, and [s]aid he had advi[s]ed the Ma[s]ter to turn back as the wind was [s]o much again[s]t us, and we [s]hould not feel the [s]urges [s]o much, when we went before it. Happy would it have been for us all, if this advice had been taken while day-light remained; but the man was ob[s]tinate, and continued beating about till nearly the clo[s]e of day; then finding it impo[s][s]ible to make his intended port, attempted to return to Dover. As night came on, the [s]torm increa[s]ed, and though [s]o late in the [s]ea[s]on was attended with the mo[s]t vivid lightning and heavy claps of thunder; the [s]ea was unu[s]ually agitated, the wind varying almo[s]t every in[s]tant and re[s]ting at no [s]ettled point. It is impo[s][s]ible, my dear Celia, to give you an adequate idea of the horrors of our situation in [s]o [s]mall a ve[s][s]el, driving about at the mercy of the waves and wind in a night, the pitchy darkne[s]s of which was only alleviated by lightning, which [s]erved to give us momentary views of the [s]urrounding dangers. And how [s]hall I tell my dear Celia, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-491.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] that in the mid[s]t of this di[s]tre[s]s and terror, I had one pang to encounter more acute by far than the near approach of expected death. Rook[s]by attached him[s]elf entirely to Clara. All his care, all his anxious [s]olicitude was expre[s][s]ed for her. We had all ri[s]en from our beds, Kingly [s]upported his wife in his arms. "My dear boys," [s]aid [s]he, "Heaven protect them."---"Heaven will protect us all, I hope my love," [s]aid he, passing his hand acro[s]s his eyes. Rook[s]by [s]at in a di[s]tant corner of the cabin be[s]ide Clara, who re[s]ted her head upon his [s]houlder. Sad and [s]olitary, I supported my[s]elf again[s]t a table, that was fastened to the cabin floor, and re[s]igning myself to that Power, who could in an in[s]tant either re[s]cue us from impending death, or plunge us at once into eternity---thus gave the reigns to reflection. Through every [s]cene of my pa[s]t life, how large has been my portion of mi[s]ery, and how [s]mall comparatively, my allotment of joy: then why, coward [s]oul, do[s]t thou [s]hrink from the friendly [s]troke, that will [s]et thee free from the heavy clog of mortality, and lift thee above the[s]e regions of tran[s]itory, fading joys, to one where plea[s]ure will be immutable, unchangeable and can never end!---Oh! Almighty Father of the Univer[s]e, weary as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-492.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] my pilgrimage has been, I acknowledge thy mercies have been ever beyond my de[s]erts; to thee then do I commit my[s]elf---do with me as thou wilt---only; Oh! benignant Creator, grant me a portion of meekne[s]s and resignation equal to my afflictions. Thou art the Father of the fatherle[s]s; under thy protecting care my child will ever be [s]ecure. Do thou never for[s]ake her in the hour of trial, and of thy mercy, grant [s]he may never forget thee. Forgive my manifold offences, as from my [s]oul I pardon every offence I may have received from my fellow-creatures. As the[s]e reflections pa[s][s]ed through my mind, I felt a calm [s]erenity take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my [s]oul. I looked with an eye of complacency on Clara and Rook[s]by, who[s]e horrors were depicted on their pale countenances, I even wished them peace of mind and fortitude to meet the impending danger as they ought. This world [s]eemed fleeting from before my eyes, and I looked forward with humble hope, to that which was to come. "Chearily! chearily! my dear cou[s]in," [s]aid Kingly, taking my hand, which hung motionle[s]s by my [s]ide, "come, come, we are worth half a dozen dead folks yet.--- 'Tis a tight little ve[s][s]el---my life for it, we weather the [s]torm, and this will be a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-493.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] seasoning for you. You will not be ea[s]ily frightened after this." "My dear Mrs. Rook[s]by," [s]aid Mrs. Kingly, laying her hand on that of mine, which her hu[s]band held, "how much reason you have, to hate me, and all my family." "Hu[s]h," [s]aid I, (frightened, lea[s]t [s]he was going to reveal my [s]ecret) believe me, I love and re[s]pect all of your family, whom I have ever known." "Do not [s]ay [s]o, thou much injured woman, look there, (pointing to Rook[s]by) You cannot e[s]teem that wretch, and yet you are linked to him for life, while the only man capable of rewarding virtue like yours: but no matter, 'tis I have done it all, and I de[s]erve to be unhappy." I was greatly di[s]tre[s][s]ed to hear her talk in this manner. But before I could interrupt her, [s]he thus continued. "We are now, my dear cou[s]in, hovering on the brink of eternity. Which of us, or whether any may e[s]cape the horrors of this awful night, heaven alone can tell; but we have both children. Promi[s]e me then my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-494.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] friend, [s]hould you [s]urvive, to be a mother to my poor babes, while they [s]hall require a mother's tender care: and [s]hould it be my fate to e[s]cape and yours to peri[s]h; here in my Maker's [s]ight, I [s]wear to con[s]ider your Clementina as my own child." She had hardly [s]poke, when a [s]evere [s]hock which the ve[s][s]el received convinced us we had [s]truck on [s]ome rocks, and immediately from the deck i[s][s]ued a confu[s]ed noi[s]e of "lo[s]t! gone! all is over!" Rook[s]by [s]tarted from his [s]eat and clasping Clara in his arms, ru[s]hed upon the deck: Kingly did the [s]ame by his wife. The love of life [s]till prevailed over the [s]en[s]e of mi[s]ery and I followed them as well as I was able, crawling on my hands and knees up the [s]teps. Kingly met me ju[s]t as I had reached the top and taking me in his arms carried me to his wife. Here a new [s]cene of horror discovered it[s]elf; the day had begun to dawn ju[s]t enough to [s]hew us that we were on a reef of rocks which ran a con[s]iderable di[s]tance from the [s]hore, and that the rage of the breakers, while the wind continued [s]o violent would prevent any boat from coming to our a[s][s]i[s]tance. "See," cried Mrs. Kingly, "there is no hope." I could not an[s]wer.---We [s]unk upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v3&image=328-495.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] the deck folded in each others arms, Kingly knelt be[s]ide and endeavoured to [s]upport us, and thus in [s]ilent agony, we waited the expected [s]hock when our ve[s][s]el would fall to pieces. But it was near two hours before this event took place. At length unable to withstand the repeated [s]hocks, [s]he parted and I [s]aw Rook[s]by and Clara plunged into the waves. My terrors and grief here became too great for human nature to [s]upport and I lo[s]t all [s]en[s]e of my [s]ufferings. How long I remained in[s]en[s]ible I cannot tell, but on recovering my recollection, I found my[s]elf alone on the wreck, [s]lightly fa[s]tened to it by a [s]mall cord, that was pa[s][s]ed round my wai[s]t and tied to a ring on the remaining part of the deck. The terrors which at that moment took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my mind, are [s]till too fre[s]h in my memory to [s]uffer me to proceed. Adieu, MERIEL. END OF THE THIRD VOLUME. [
