 tooke himselfe to trauayle. When the princely Primaleo , heard pronouced before his famous father the Emperour of Constantinople , the sorrowfull Letters sent by the Lady of the Lake , how his best belooued brother was loste in the vnfortunate Forest of England : he abandoned all his Courtly delights, and neuer ceassed wandring, till he became prisoner in the same place. So my simple selfe (Right Honourable) hauing sufficiently seene the rare vertues of your noble minde, the heroycall quallities of your prudent person: thought, though abilitie were inferiour to gratifie with some gift, yet good will was ample to bestowe with the best. When all the braue Gallants and woorthy Gentlemen in Roome , presented vnto the Emperour Iewels and gifts of great value and estimation: a poore Cittizen amongst the all brought a handfull of Flowers , and offered them to the Emperour , the which he receiued gratiously and with great affection, and gaue him a great reward. Why (quoth one of the Gentlemen ) how durst thou presume to giue so poore a present, to so puissant a person? Why (quoth the Citizen ) how durst they be so bolde to giue such great gifts? Quoth the Gentleman , they are of great credit, and beside, their gifts woorthy the receiuing. And I am poore (quoth the Cittizen ) and therefore I giue such a meane gift, yet hath it beene gratefully accepted: And although they discend of such noble Linages: yet doo they owe dutifull alleageaunce vnto the Emperour , and as poore as I am, J beare him as true a heart as the best: Euen so my poore gift hath beene as faithfully deliuered: as the richest Iewell that was by them presented. And loe Right Honourable, among such expert heads, such pregnaunt inuentions, and such commendable writers, as preferre to your seemely selfe, woorkes woorthy of eternall memory: A simple Soule, (more imboldened on your clemencie, then any action whatsoeuer he is able to make manifest) presumeth to present you with such vnpullished practises: as his simple skill is able to comprehend. Yet thus much I am to assure your Honour, that among all them which owe you dutifull seruice, and among all the braue Bookes which haue beene bestowed: these my little labours containe so much faithfull zeale to your welfare, as others whatsoeuer, I speake without any excepcion. But least that your Honour should deeme I forge my tale on flatterie, and that I vtter with my mouth, my hart thinketh not: I wish for the tryall of my trustinesse, what reasonable affayres your Honour can best deuise, so shall your minde be deliuered from doubt: and my selfe rid of any such reproche. But as the puissantest Prince is not voyde of enemies, the gallantest Champion free from foes, and the moste honest liuer without some backbiters: euen so the brauest Bookes hath many malicious iudgements, and the wisest writers not without rashe reports. If then (Right Honourable) the moste famous are foud fault withall, the cuningest controlled, & the promptest wits reproched by spitefull speeches: how dare so rude a writer as I, seeme to set foorth so meane a matter, so weake a woorke, and so skillesse a stile? When the learned are deluded: I must needes be mocked, and when the skilfullest are scorned: I must needes be derided: But yet I remember, the wise will not reprehend rashly, the learned condemne so lightly, nor the courteous misconster the good intent of the writer: But onely sutch as Æsops Dog, that brags but dares not bite, hid in a hole and dare not shewe their heads, against all such, the countenaunce of your Honour is sufficient to contend, which makes me not feare the force of their enuie. The Chirurgion more douteth the hidden Fistule: then the wide wound, the woorthiest warriour more feareth the secret assault: the the boldest battaile, A little hooke taketh a great Fish, a little winde falleth downe big fruit, a smal spark kindleth to a great fire, a little stone may make a tall ma stuble, & a small wound kill a puissant person: Euen so the hidden enemy may sooner harme a ma: then whe he trieth his quarrell face to face, and the least report of a slaudrous toug (beeing lightly beleeued) may discredit him to his vtter vndooing. But for my part I feare not, let the prate at their pleasure, & talke till their tougs ake, your Honour to please, is the cheefe of my choise, your good will to gaine is my wished reward: which shalbe more welcome then Cressus aboundaunce, and more hartily accepted then any worldly wealth. The last part of this woorke remaineth vnfinished, the which for breuity of time, and speedines in the Imprinting: I was constrained to permit till more limitted leysure. Desiring your Honour to accept this in meane time, as a signe and token of my dutifull goodwill. Not long it will be before the rest be finished and the renowned Palmerin of England with all speede shall be sent you. Thus praying for your prosperitie, and the increase of your Honourable dignitie: I commend your woorthye state to the heauenly eternitie. Your Honours moste dutifull seruaunt at all assayes. Antony Munday . curious then circumspect: in naming my booke by such a vaine glorious title, for some will suppose heere are rare exploytes of martial mindes to be seen: which whe they haue prooued, they finde it to faint. Othersome will desire for Venus daintie dalliances: but Iuno dealeth so iustly in this cause, that their also they misse their marke. Then how (will some say) can Fame be so furnished: and bothe of these absent? the matter (say I) shall make manifest what I haue attempted: and then if I be founde faultie, I will stand to your gentle iudgementes. That man is very wise that neuer offendeth in folly, that man is very valiant that neuer meetes with his match, and that man is very circumspect that neuer talketh awry, the righteous man offendeth seue times a day: then needes must the negligent be found very faulty. It is a good horse that neuer stumbleth, and he a seuere seruaut that neuer displeaseth his maister, then beare with my rudenesse if I chaunce to offend you: my good will did labour in hope for to please you. Againe, some will be inquisitiue, why I am so willing to welcome Euphues into England? he beeyng so excellent: and my selfe so simple? If Euphues so wisely dooth wish you beware, and to preuent the perilles that heedelesse heades may haue, wishing youth likewise to frame their fancies so fit, that no crooked chaunces doo happen to harme them: Then like that Lilly whose sent it so sweete, and fauour his freend who wisheth your welfare. And although my wit be so weake: that I cannot welcome as I would, and my skyll to simple to gratifye so gentle a gueast: I trust my good will shall plead me a pardon,  & my honest intent be nothing misliked. Thus hoping to haue your courteous consentes, which is the reward I cheefest require, I wishe my woorkes may prooue as profitable to you in the reading: as they were delightfull to me in the writing. Your freend to commaund A. Munday. Gentlemen of Italy. The Argument. Gonzalo Guicciardo, elected Duke by the most worthye Orlando Fiorentino. This aforesayde Gonzalo, (renowmed for his princely gouerment, obayed for his singuler wisdom, praysed for his pollitique suppressing of prowde vsurpinge enimies, and honored for his humilytie to his subiects in generall) was not onely accounted as a second Mutio among his freends and familyars, but euen amonge his very enemies was also esteemed as a prince worthy of eternall memory. And nature the more to agrauate his ioyes in his hoary haires: gaue hym a Sonne called Zelauto, whose singuler humanitie, whose puisance in feates of armes, whose dexteritie in witte, and whose comelye shape in personage, caused hym through all Venice to bee greatly accounted of. This gallant youth Zelauto (more desirous to aduaunce his fame by traueilyng straunge countries: then to leade his lyngring life styll in the court of his famous father) one day by chaunce tooke courage to open the hidden thoughts which longe incombred his carefull breast, and hauing espied his father at such conuenient leasure, as serued best for his auayle, yeelding his obeysaunce as dutie beseemed, entred into this discourse. If (Right woorthy and renowmed Father) nature had adorned me with such rare and excellent quallities, as might procure an hartes ease and ioy vnto your princely estate: then would dutie cause me to keepe my minde in silence, and feare (of displeasing your aged hart) byd me restrayne my vowed attempt. But sith I am destitute of that which my hart desireth,  & willing to gaine the same by painefull industry: I hope I shall purchase no ill will of your person, nor displease the mindes of your subiectes in generall. First weigh and consider by your gratious aduisement, that a youthfull minde more desireth the fragrant fieldes: then the hidden house, Custome confesseth, yea, and lawe of Nature alloweth, that it is more permanent to a princely courage, to seeke the renowmed mansion, of the most illustrious and sacred Ladye Fame: then to drowne his youthfull dayes in gulfs of gaping greef, in silet sorrows, in vaine thoughts and cogitations, and also in trifling and idle exercises, which maketh him more prone vnto vice then vertue, more apt vnto lewdnes: then contented liuing, yea, maketh him so friuilous and fantasticall, that nothing but libidinous thoughtes, beastly behauiour, is his whole exercise. For then euery blasing beame, and euery sugred countenaunce of a woman allureth him, that floting on the Seas of foolish fansie, and hauing abid one lusty gale of winde, wherewith the Barke of his body, is beaten against the Rockes of his Ladyes lookes, then the poore patient falleth into so extreme an extasie, that one worde will kill him, and an other reuiue him. Thus is he inclosed amid these subtill snares, while in the warlike feeld he might enioy his libertie, and their win fame which should last eternally. These and such like crabbed conceites (deere Father) vrgeth me to craue your leaue and licence, that I may a while visite straunge Countries, In which time, I doubt not but to atchieue such exploytes, that at my returne it will be treble ioy to your Princely eares to heare them recounted. Sonne Zelauto (aunswered the Duke) this your discourse is both commendable, and allowable, for I lyke well of your intent, and with all my hart giue consent that for a limitted time you shall seeke aduentures, which time shall amount vnto .vi. yeares, and on my blessing I charge thee, not to breake that appointed time. In the meane while, if God call me (as my life is vncertaine) I frankly & freely giue thee all is myne. Wherfore looke well to thy selfe that good report may be heard of thee, which vnto me will be great contentation. But nowe as touching what ayde and assistance thou wilt haue with thee: speake, and it shall be graunted. Good Father (answered Zelauto) none but onely one to beare me company, which I know will be sufficient. Well (quoth the Duke) receiue heere my blessing, this portion of money, and this knight to beare thee company. And I pray God in all thy wayes to guide and protect thee, and so you may depart when you please. Zelauto accompanied with his knight, departed from the Court of his famous Father, and tooke shipping to goe vnto Naples, from thence, he trauailed vnto Valentia in Spayne, and chauncing into the company of certayne English Merchauntes, who in the Latine tongue told him the happy estate of England, & how a worthy Princes gouerned their common weale, and all suche thinges as could not be more praysed then they deserued. The which Zelauto hearing, craued of them that he might sayle with them into England, and he woulde liberally reward them. They beeyng contented, and hauing laden their Shippes with such necessaryes as they best desyred: within fewe dayes hoysed sayles, and away they went. This young youth Zelauto beeyng come into England, and seene the rare and vertuous vsage of the illustrious and thrise renowmed Princes, with the great honour and fauour which he obtayned among her woorthy Lordes: purposed to stay still there. But yet remembring, that although he sawe one place: many others were as yet vnseene, after a yeere expyred, he tooke shipping into Persia, and so departed. In processe of time he had visited many straunge Countryes, sustayned many and wonderfull iniuryes among the Turkes, which after shall be declared. And returning homeward, happened on the borders of Sicile, where Fortune was fauourable vnto him: that vnawares he happened on the caue of a valiaunt Knight, who was a Christian, and hauing committed an hainous offence: fled out of his owne Countrie, and inhabited there in a silent Cell, among the woods. This Knight beyng named Astraepho, and hearing the trampling of one about his denne: tooke his weapons, and came foorth. He beeing greatly abashed at the sight of Zelauto, for that in tenne yeeres space he neither sawe man nor woman: but had lyued there a sauage lyfe: forgetting all poyntes of humanitie sayd. VVhat varlet, art thou come to seeke my death? thou art welcome, and therewith all strooke at Zelauto, who alas through tediousnesse of trauell, and long beeyng without any sustenaunce: was constrayned to yeeld, and falling on his knees submitted himselfe to his mercye, which Astraepho seeing, sayd as hereafter followeth. Orchard of Amarous Aduentures. that professest thy selfe a Souldier vnder God Mars his Ensigne: and so soone conquered? What doost thou think that this thy submission, shall hinder me of my preteded purpose? Thy death it is I seeke, and more honour shall I obtaine by the slaughter of such a wretche: then to let thee lyue any longer time. Most woorthy syr, if euer any iot of clemency consysted in your valiant brest: then respect I craue, the distressed case of your poore vassaill. And meruayll not though in force I am not able to resist against you, for that the great miseries which I haue susteyned in these my tedious trauayles, hath quite bereued me of my manly might. A bad excuse (say they) is better then none at all,   [  The Lyon dooth easily conquer his yeelding pray. ] you pleade nowe simplicitie, through the defect of your valiancie, and by such sophisticall Sillogismes, to beguile me craftilie, no, no, poore wretch, harde was thy hap to light in his handes: who seeketh the subuertion of thy state, and to cause thee yeelde thy neck to the rigor of his manly might. Long delayes neede not, differ not with dalliance, for I am bent to thy vtter ruin. Small hope hath the siely Lambe,   [  Where as Fortune is so aduerse, small hope is to be had. ] in the rauening iawes of the greedy Woolfe, to escape with life, lyttle comfort hath the pensiue prisoner at the poynt of death, to shun so harde a lot. So I (poore soule) in the handes of a Tirant (who more regardeth blood, then bountie, more respecteth death then delyuerie, and more vaunteth of villainy, then any valiancie) what succour can I haue in this my sorrowe? what hope in this my so harde hap, to craue life it auayleth not, to desire a respit it booteth not, and to striue against the streame, were but a presuming boldnes, if I wish for death I gayne it, if I wish for life, I lose it. What shall betide thee poore distressed Zelauto ? hap weale or woe, hap life or death, hap blisse or bale: I will aduenture by fayre woords to intreate him,   [   Zelauto at last by faire woordes, dooth seeke to win fauour.  ] & so it may happen to stay his rigor. Good syr, if euer humanitie harbored in that noble brest, or if euer pittie pronounced her puissaunce on your princely person: then respect (I pray) the distressed case of your conquered captiue. Small honour shall you haue by my death, & no Fame to vaunt on a naked man. My life can lyttle pleasure you, and my death lesse, therefore seeke not to shed his blood, who at your will & pleasure voweth bothe heart and hand at your courteous commaundement. In deed I confesse,   [  After many clowdy showers, yet shineth a fayre day. ] that small honor is his due that vaunts on so prostrate a pray, & therefore somewhat hath thy woords satisfied my former desire, for in deed, a straunge and wonderfull sight it is to me, to see a man that haue seene none these ten yeeres passed, therefore pardon what is spoken, there resteth the greater amendes to be made. Syr, more bound vnto you in duty,   [   Zelauto right glad of his delyuerie, yeeldeth thankes.  ] then euer I am able to performe: I yeeld you all thankes possible that resteth in so poore a person, & I doubt not but that God hath appoynted all at the best, for these fiue yeeres & more haue I visited straunge coutreyes: and neuer yet did I happen on any such aduenture. And haue you ben a Traueiler syr? then vnfolde I pray you what hath bene the mishaps, that the frowning Fates vnto you hath alotted, and first tell I pray you, of what soyle, what Parentage and kindred you are of, and what is your name. Syr, as necessitie hath no lawe, so neede at this present vrgeth me to speake. In this your Caue (I am sure) you are not destitute of victualls, the which I want, wherfore if it shall please you, to refresh his hunger, who is ready to faynt: I will discourse vnto you afterward my whole aduentures at large. Alas syr, if such simple fare as I haue may seeme to suffise your hunger: come neere, and we will goe to dinner, and afterward will we discourse of such matters (as perchaunce) may be profitable to bothe. With right good will syr, & a thousand thanks for your courtesie, extended vnto me in this my vnlooked for mishap. And it may so fortune, that after our conference had together: we may with our pleasaunt talke well content eche other. Well syr, approche this my homely Mansion, and I desire you to accept the goodwill of your poore hoste. after they had vvell refreshed themselues. [  Honest talk passeth away the time pleasauntly. ] Now Syr, how lyke you of your homely entertaynment? where no better is, bad may suffise, and to a contented minde nothing is preiudiciall. You see howe poore folkes are content with pottage, Ritch men may goe to dynner when they wyll, and poore men when they may. Syr, he that wyll looke a giuen Horse in the mouth:   [  A freendlie gratulatio for curtesie receyued. ] is vnwoorthy of the gyft, your fare hath suffised me, and you haue vanquisht him, who would haue murdred mee. What dayntie delycates is to be looked for in desert places? it suffiseth the Courts of Princes to haue their delycate fare, and to poore Trauellers, the homeliest dyshe is welcome, they looke for no after seruice, & in steede of sauce, they vse their hungrie appetite, we syt not to haue our Table taken vp, soone. They in their superfluitie, we in our want. They in their prodigalitie, we spare for an after extremitie. Who more couetous then they, that haue all at their pleasure? and who more freendly then they, that haue a lyttle, and impart thereof to their freendes. They spend, we spare, they vse excesse, and we hardnesse. And therefore sayth Tullie : We ought to haue great respect,   [  Cicero in partitionibus Orat. ] least that the hydden vice: That dooth vppon the vertues tende, dooth slylie vs intyce. The elder Cato   [  Cato Senior. ] also vppon this sayth. By two thinges I encrease my wealth, by tylling of my ground: The other by good husbandrie, that I therein haue found. For why, the one aboundounce bringes, as much as heart can chuse: The other dooth me wisely teach, howe I the same should vse. Thus syr may you see howe sparing is comended: and now somwhat wyll I speake as concerning inordinate spending, and laciuious excesse, which hath the personnes that vsed it, greatly abused. Lucullus , for his sumptuous buyldings,   [  Lucullus. ] and his inordinate expences, thought among the Romaines to be magnified, for that he thought to excell all his predecessors. But Pompey hearing thereof,   [  Pompey. ] and greatly desirous to see if all were as the common brute dyd blase it abroade: iorneyed vntyll he came vnto Lucullus Mansion place, where seeing that the thing it selfe excelled the common report, in derision sayde vnto Lucullus . These gay and gorgious buyldings heere, be set with Stories braue:   [   An excellent priuie nyp giuen vnto Lucullus .  ] And open windowes, that the ayre, free entraunce in may haue. For Summer they delightfull are, and gallant to beholde: But when that Hiems dooth approche, her blastes wyll make you colde. Truly, in my opinion, his woordes stoode with great reason, and ought also greatly to be esteemed of, for fancie is so fickle, that each tryfling toy (though it be not profitable, if it be pleasaunt) is now a dayes most desired. As Lucullus , he was all in his prodigallitie, but nothing regarded in the ende the myserie.   [   Aesculapius sonne to Apollo .  ] Farther we reade, how Apollos sonne Æsculapius , for his prodigall minde, & vnsatiable desire of rytches: was cast into the bottomles Limbo , among the Fiendes, and Diuels of hell. And diuers other (which were too tedious to rehearse) which got their goods wickedly, and spend it laciuiously. And therefore I wyll say with Tullie .  Mal e parta,   [  Tullie. ] male dilabuntur. But now Sir,   [   Zelauto dooth returne to giue his freend thakes for his lyberalyty.  ] returning to our contented feast passed, for my part, I am to yeelde a thousand thankes, and to shewe you the like curtesie if I come in place where abilitie shall serue me, And wish you not to thinke, but as it was lyberally and curteously bestowed: so was it gratefully and hartily accepted. And now may I well say, that he which neuer tasteth necessitie: knoweth not what want is.   [  Neede hath no law, necessitie breaketh stone walles. ] For whyles I tasted on our Courtly iunckets, I neuer thought I should haue bene driuen so neere, but now, this state contenteth me farre better them my former, which was nothing but vanitie. Syr, this your pleasaunt discourse, is bothe pithy and profitable, & sauoureth of the sence which prooueth perfect in ye conclusion.   [  A promise made, may allwayes be claymed for a due debt. ] But now as touching our talke before dinner, I must not forget your promise, for that you sayd, I should vnderstad the sum of your myseries, your aduentures happened in trauayle, your name, Countrey, & parentage, which tolde: I shall declare the better some of my straunge aduentures. Indeede syr,   [   Zelauto accordeth to his freendly request.  ] promise is due debt we say, and according to promise, I will vnfolde that which is bothe strauge, & lamentable, wherefore giue me leaue I desire you, & you shall heare, the perillous Pylgrimage which I poore soule haue passed. Fyrst syr,   [   Zelauto telleth his first trauayles.  ] as concerning my Countrey, Parentage and name: I giue you to vnderstand, that I am sonne to the woorthy Gonzalo Guiciardo , who is Duke of Venice , and by name I hight Zelauto .   [   Gonzalo Guiciardo , Duke of Venice .  ] Long tyme had I soiourned in the Court of my noble Father, not knowing the vse and order of forreigne Countreyes, wherevnto my minde was adicted, wherfore at the last, I ventured boldly, and tolde my Father what in heart I had attempted: the which he well lyking of: gaue his consent,   [   His trauelling to Naples .  ] and so I and an other Knight (whome my Father gaue me for companion) traueyled towarde Naples , and in our trauayle: we met with certaine Outlawes, whom we call Banditie .   [   Banditie , called Outlawes, doo wound Zelauto .  ] These cruell fellowes set vppon mee, wounded mee verie sore, slew my Companion, dispoyled of my apparell and money, leauing mee for dead. But God more mercifull then these Uillaines were tyrannicall,   [   His hard escaping to Naples .  ] would not suffer mee to perish in their handes, but they (beeing gone) gaue mee the power to creepe on all fowre to Naples . When I was come thyther: I knew not what to doo, because I was freendlesse, moneylesse, and dispoyled out of my Garmentes.   [  His bolde entraunce into an Inne. ] At last, hauing espyed an Osteria : I boldly entered, putting my selfe in the handes of God, to whome I referred the paying of my charges. freendshippe he found vvith Madonna Vrsula, Madonna della Casa . the house.  ] I entered, and the first person that I sawe, was the Misteresse of the house, who was named Madonna Vrsula , a very proper, pleasaunt, kinde & courteous Gentlewoman. At my comming in,   [  Her freendly entertainment. ] you are welcome Gentleman (quoth she) Is it your will I pray you to haue lodging? I answered, yea surely, vntill such time as my wounds be healed, and my selfe better refreshed. With that quoth she to one of her maydens. Margarita ,   [ Magarita la donizela. ] conduct this Gentleman to the best Chamber, make him a good fire, and carry vp with you a Boccall of winne and a manchet, in the meane while, wil I make ready his supper.   [  A freendly and gentle offer. ] And Gentleman (quoth she) what thing so euer it be that you want: call for, and if it be to be gotten in Naples for loue or money, you shall haue it. Heere was yet good entertainment, after so hard mishaps, my greefe and sorrowe was not so great before, for the losse of my companion, my money & apparail: but her cheerefull woordes did as much reuiue my hart. And so yeelding her great thankes I went vp into my Chamber, where against my comming, I found a very great fire, my Chaire ready set for me to sit downe with my Cushion, & my boots pulled of, warme Pantofles brought vnto me, and a cleane kertcher put on my head.   [   Madonna Vrsula her returne to Zelauto .  ] So hauing sitten there about the space of halfe an houre: vp came the misteris of the house, who taking a glasse, filled it with Wine, and came vnto me saying. Sir ( Per licentia vostra ) I salute you. So causing another glasse to be filled with wine:    [  An Italian courtesie. ] shee gaue it me, whom I pledged as courteously as I could. Then tooke she an other Chaire, & sat downe by me, [  She commaundeth her maide to depart, and beginneth her talke. ] commaunding her mayden seruaunt (who attended there) to giue place, who making courtesie to me and her misteris, departed. Then began she to talke with me in this order as followeth. are, and what misfortunes hath happened vnto you, that you are so greeuously wounded. Pardon me I pray you, if I demaund the thing which you are not willing to vtter, and also because on so suddaine acquaintaunce, I enterprise to question with you:   [ Zelauto his reply.  ] Gentlewoman (quoth I) the good opinion, and great liking that you haue of me, is as yet vndeserued, and as yet you haue seene no such ciuilitie in me as deserueth to be comended. But yet I am to yeeld you thanks for your good liking.   [  A fayned excuse to colour the matter. ] And as touching my mishaps, and this straunge aduenture which hath happened, and if you please to attend the discourse: I will tell you all. I am of Padua , and there my parentes dwell, and beeing minded to see the vse of other Countries: I left my Parents, beeing well stored with money, and a Gentleman also which bare me company. Beeing come heere into the kingdome: among the woods we encountred with certaine Banditie , who set vpon vs, slew my companion, left me for dead, and spoyled me of all my money and apparell. So God helping me: I haue hardly got hether with my life. Thus haue you knowen some part of my mishaps,   [   Her encouragement giuen a freshe to Zelauto  ] nowe consider thereof by your good construction. Sir (quoth shee) your hap hath been hard, and little doo your Parentes knowe of this your suddaine aduersitie. Be not discouraged therfore, heere shall you abide vntill such time as your woundes are healed, and that you haue perfectly recouered your health, and beside what money you want: you shalbe well prouided therof. Therefore let not this mishap dismay you, a freend in necessitie: is better then a hundred in prosperitie.   [   Signor Giouanni Martino , a merchaunt in Naples .  ] But are you not acquainted with any here in Naples ? Yes (quoth I) I haue letters to Signor Giouanni Martino , fro my Father, for the recouerie of money, as now I stand in need thereof. Well Sir (quoth she) pardon my boldnes I pray you, & first trie your freend, & if he faile: you know where to speede of mony,   [   Madonna Vrsula her courteous promise.  ] & of a greater matter if neede require, In the meane time, I will see how neere your supper is ready, & wil come againe and beare you company. How like you now Sir of the freendly entertainment that I obtayned at this Gentlewomans hand, and also of her proffered courtesie? Certainly Zelauto ,    [   Astraepho telleth his iudgement on this matter. ] you are much bound vnto that Gentlewoman, for in my opinion, you might haue gone to twentie Osteriaes in Naples and not haue founde the like freendship. But proceede I pray you, how sped you with your freend for your money, and how did your hostes deale with you? You shall heare Sir.    [   Zelauto proceedeth in his discourse.  ] After she was departed out of the Chamber, there came vp two modest Damsels, and they couered the table. At last came she vp againe. Sir (quoth she) doo you not thinke it long before you goe to supper?   [  She returneth demaunding if he wil go to supper. ] No (quoth I) in good time yet, you neede not make such hast. Well Sir (quoth she) anon heere will a Surgion come, who shall dresse your woundes, and looke vnto you till you be perfectly healed. Then was our Supper brought vp very orderly,   [  They goe to supper. ] and she brought me water to washe my handes. And after I had washed I sat downe, & she also, but concerning what good cheere we had: I neede not make report. For all thinges was in as good order, and aswell to my contentation: as euer it was in my Fathers Court. [   She proffereth to play with Zelauto .  ] After Supper (quoth she) Sir but that you are so ouercharged with trauell, and faynt with your woundes I would play a game or two with you at the Primera . But we will referre that till to morrowe at night.   [  A Chirurgion commeth and dresseth his woundes. ] Then came in the Chirurgion and he dressed my woundes, and water was brought to wash my feete, my Bed was warmed, and so I went and layde me downe to take my rest. he should receiue money, and how he sped and of his farder freendship that he had with Madonna Vrsula. Nowe when I had well and sufficiently reposed my selfe all night, and in the morning finding my selfe more strong and forceable,    [   In ye morning Madonna Vrsula cometh to see Zelauto  ] then before I was: I thought to haue risen, But vp came Misteris Vrsula agayne, and comming to my Bed side, she sayd. Gentleman, haue you taken quiet rest this night or no? Yes surely Misteris (quoth I) I neuer slept so soundly in all my life before, and credit me, I finde my selfe very well amended. Wherefore now I will rise. No not yet Sir (quoth she) you shall first make your Collation in bed, with such things as I haue ordayned, and haue your wounds dressed agayne: and then shall you rise.   [  Then fall in talke againe. ] and then shall you rise. I thanke you good Misteris Vrsula (quoth I) and surely it seemeth very straunge vnto me, that on a straunger you should bestowe such courtesie? Sir (quoth she) on the vertuous and well disposed, no one can bestowe courtesie sufficient. As for my part, to such Gentlemen, as vpon some occasion are fallen into want & necessitie: I thinke it a great poynt of humanitie, to bestowe on them freendly hospitalitie. And therefore I followe the minde of Lactantius , who sayth, there is a kinde of hospitalitie,   [  Lactantius de vero culto. Chap. 12. ] which is vsed for a priuate gayne and secret commoditie, and for no loue fauour nor freendship at all. Of which sort I am none. I referre that to common Inholders,   [  Inholders & Tauerners for comoditie. ] and those tipling Tauerners. Let them entertayne for their commoditie, and I for courtesie. I remember how Caesar dooth comend in his Commentaries, [   Caesar his Commentaries commedeth the Germaines .  ] the great fauour & freendship that the Germaines shewed to straungers. For not only would they defend them from their enemies: but also entertaine them with meate, drinke, clothing & lodging. The Scripture also maketh mention, how Abraham , receiued into his house (as he thought) men,   [  Abraham Genesis. ] but he receiued God himselfe. Lot also receiued Angels in the shape of men into his house. Wherefore for his hospitalitie Lot escaped the fire of Sodom & Gomorra ,   [   Sodom and Gomorra. Rahab deliuered from death for ye same. ] Rahab , for the same likewise, with all hers was preserued from the terror of death. And what saith Saint Ambrose ? Who can tell if we welcome Christe or no, when we giue freendly entertainment to straungers?   [   S. Ambrose as touching ye entertainmet of straungers.  ] Therfore sir seeme not to be offended I pray you, though I preach on this fashion, for both loue, dutie, faith and charity, dooth bind me to welcome you hether curteously. Alas good Misteris (quoth I) I see well your great curtesie, but I knowe not how to requite the same.   [   Zelauto answereth her learned discourse.  ] Sir (quoth she) what you are not able to doo: God will doo for you, and it is sufficient for me to receiue thankes at your handes, for greater is my reward in heauen. And with that she departed to fetch me my breakefast. Now syr, tell me I pray you, if the memory of this rare and vertuous woman is not woorthy to be rehearsed? Now credit me Zelauto ,   [   Astraepho vnfoldeth his iudgement agayne.  ] she surpasseth all that euer I heard of, both for promptnes of wit, vertue of the minde, and excellencie in qualities. But I pray you could she repeat these Authors whereof you haue showen, so readily? Yea Sir, and a great many more, which I am not able to rehearse. For surely the rare excellencie that I did beholde in her: made me so amazed, that I coulde not attend all her discourses. [   Astraepho desireth to heare more of this matter.  ] Now for Gods sake proceede, and let me heare more of this: for surely shee is woorthy of eternall remembraunce, in my iudgement. Then came vp two Damsels, the one brought a pretie litle table couered,   [ Zelauto now goeth to breake fast.  ] and set it on the Beds side, and the other brought such necessaries as did belong to that we wet about. Then came she her selfe, and brought me such meate, as I neuer did eate the like before: and what other cheere was there I referre that to your iudgement. But then (quoth she) to one of her Damsels. Goe and fetch me my Lute, and I will recreat this Gentleman with a pleasant song,   [  She sendeth for her Lute. ] the copie whereof she gaue me, and for a neede I could rehearse it. Nowe good Zelauto let me heare it,    [   Astraepho desireth to heare her song.  ] for I am sure it is woorthy the rehearsall. Since you are so desirous: you shall, wherefore attend it diligently. So Loue procureth care: As Loue dooth end annoy, So Loue dooth cause despaire. But yet I oft heard say, and wise men like did giue: That no one at this day, without a loue can liue. And thinke you I, will loue defie: No, no, I loue, vntill I die. Loue knits the sacred knot, Loue hart and hand dooth binde: Loue will not shrinke one iot, but Loue dooth keepe his kinde. Loue maketh freendes of foes, loue stayes the common wealth: Loue dooth exile all woes, that would impaire our health. Since loue dooth men and monsters mooue: VVhat man so fond will loue disprooue? Loue keepes the happy peace, Loue dooth all strife alay: Loue sendeth rich increase, Loue keepeth warres away. Loue of it selfe is all, Loue hath no fellowe mate: Loue causeth me, and shall, Loue those, that loue my state. Then loue will I, vntill I dye: And all fond Loue I will defye.
