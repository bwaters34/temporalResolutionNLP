I will daily think of your di[s]tre[s][s]es, my dear mother, [s]aid [s]he, and they will [s]erve as a [s]hield to my heart, and render it invulnerable to the attacks of vanity or the illu[s]ion of pa[s][s]ion. And is my father living? [s]aid Marian. I know not, replied her mother, but if he he can never be any thing to you, he has us all. It was inhuman, my dear mother, to deprive us [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] of that rank in life, we were born to fill, and which I [s]latter my[s]elf we [s]hould not have disgraced. Fooli[s]h Marian, [s]aid the anxious mother, why regret the lo[s]s of [s]uch a trifle; be virtuous, my child, you will then elevate the mo[s]t humiliating [s]tation, and ri[s]e [s]uperior to tho[s]e who[s]e only boa[s]t is wealth and titles, to render them the envy of the blind mi[s]guided multitude. Virtue alone is true nobility; content is real happine[s]s. Lydia's heart re[s]pon[s]ive echoed her mother's [s]entiments---Marian [s]ighed and was [s]ilent. The moon in maje[s]tic [s]plendor illumined the [s]ky, and darted her [s]ilver beams through the ancient elms that [s]haded Dorcas's cottage. The [s]i[s]ters were [s]eated by the door, and in obedience to their mother's command, were pouring forth their thank[s]giving to the giver of all ble[s][s]ing in an evening hymn. They had ju[s]t fini[s]hed when a ru[s]tling among the bu[s]hes made them [s]tart; a beautiful pointer ran into the cottage, and in a moment a [s]ervant in livery appeared, and enquired the way to Gwinfred-Hall. Dorcas directed him which way to go. He [s]aid he was weary, requested a drop of water, and leave to re[s]t. Lydia went to fetch him [s]ome cyder, Dorcas moved [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] towards the door, and [s]ilently admired the beauty of the [s]pangled  . The man [s]eized the opportunity, and delivered to the lovely un[s]u[s]pecting Marian a letter from Sir George Lovemore. Love and ambition had already taught her art, [s]he ha[s]tily took the offered letter, and hid it in her bo[s]om. Alas! [s]imple maid, you there fo[s]tered a [s]erpent, who[s]e [s]ubtle poi[s]on tainted your very heart. The [s]ervant having completed his errand retired, and Marian found means to peru[s]e her letter; --- it abounded with profe[s][s]ions of love, vows of everla[s]ting fidelity, and encomiums on her beauty. She read it with rapture, and though [s]o recently warned of the duplicity of men, believed every [s]yllable it contained. In conclu[s]ion, he [s]olicited a private interview the next morning, in the field adjoining her mother's cottage. Marian pau[s]ed at this reque[s]t, he[s]itated---read the letter again and re[s]olved to comply. During [s]upper [s]he was thoughtful and ab[s]ent, and when the u[s]ual hour of re[s]t arrived, [s]he retired with an anxious perturbed mind; [s]leep was to her eyes, and [s]everal times [s]he re[s]olved to [s]hew the letter to Lydia, and request her to accompany her --- But then Sir [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] George had de[s]ired her to come alone, he might be offended and [s]he might never [s]ee him again. Vanity al[s]o pleaded, he might marry her, rai[s]e her to an exalted [s]tation, and [s]hould his views be otherwi[s]e than honorable, [s]he certainly had resolution to with[s]tand his [s]olicitations. In this manner did [s]he wear out the tedious night, at five o'clock [s]he [s]tole [s]oftly from the [s]ide of her innocent [s]leeping [s]i[s]ter, and with as little noi[s]e as po[s][s]ible opened the door that led into the fields. Aurora had but faintly [s]treaked the eastern [s]kies with mingled gold and purple, when the ill-fated Marian met her lover. He thanked her for her  , told her his whole happine[s]s depended on her, and urged her immediate [s]light with him to London. Marian he[s]itated, her mother, her [s]i[s]ter, hung heavy at her heart. Sir George was an adept in the art of seduction, he talked of gaiety, [s]plendor and plea[s]ure, [s]wore [s]he was born to grace the fir[s]t [s]tation, declared it was a crime to bury [s]o much beauty and [s]weetne[s]s in a de[s]art. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] Marian's rea[s]on was not convinced, but her vanity was awakened and her [s]en[s]es dazzled, what wonder then that her [s]cruples were overcome by Sir George's artful per[s]ua[s]ions. She left the man[s]ion of peace and innocence, and in a chai[s]e which he had prepared for the purpo[s]e, hurried as fa[s]t as four hor[s]es would carry her to the feat of di[s][s]ipation and folly. Marian dropped a tear as [s]he took a la[s]t look at the cottage, but Sir George ki[s][s]ed it off, and the reflection which had cau[s]ed it to [s]tart was in[s]tantly bani[s]hed from her mind. Lydia on awakening mi[s][s]ed her [s]i[s]ter, and ha[s]tily ri[s]ing, ran into her mother's apartment, vexed that Marian [s]hould have been the fir[s]t to bid her good morning. I am not u[s]ed to be [s]uch a suaggard, my dear mother, [s]aid [s]he, but my [s]i[s]ter has received your ble[s][s]ing before me this morning. I have not [s]een your [s]i[s]ter, [s]aid Dorcas, but as it is a fine morning, [s]he has, no doubt, rambled out to enjoy its [s]weets; go, my beloved Lydia and [s]eek her. Lydia left her mother, and [s]ought her [s]i[s]ter in the fields and woods; echo a thou[s]and times repeated the name as [s]he called her dear Marian; at length fatigued and di[s]pirited, [s]he was returning [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] home, when [s]he met a [s]hepherd, who early attended his [s]heep, that way, and demanded of him whether he had [s]een her [s]i[s]ter. He had [s]een her, he [s]aw her enter the chai[s]e with Sir George, he [s]aw them drive off. Lydia heard the heart-rending tidings, [s]he would have wept, but tears refu[s]ed their relief; [s]he [s]ighed, rai[s]ed her hands to heaven in an agony of grief, and [s]unk lifele[s]s upon the ground. The [s]hepherd was frightened, nor did he u[s]e any method to re[s]tore her, but ran backward and forward, looking wildly round him, and calling aloud for help. A young gentleman who had been that morning out a [s]hooting, heard the voice of terror, and ha[s]tened to the [s]pot where the hapless Lydia lay. Her charms were not of the dazzling fort, but the more her features were examined the more they intere[s]ted the beholder. The gentleman when he fir[s]t rai[s]ed her from the ground, felt only for her as he would for any other woman in di[s]tre[s]s; but when he looked attentively on her face, and beheld her lovely though inanimate features, he felt an irre[s]i[s]tible impul[s]e to defend her not only from her pre[s]ent unea[s]ine[s]s, but to [s]hield her for ever from pain and affliction. He carried her to a [s]pring, and bathed her temples with water, [s]he opened her expre[s][s]ive blue eyes, Oh! my unhappy [s]i[s]ter, [s]aid [s]he, and freeing her[s]elf from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] arms of her deliverer, covered her face with her hands, and gave free vent to her tears. Have you lo[s]t your [s]i[s]ter, my [s]weet maid, [s]aid the [s]tranger. Alas! Sir, replied Lydia, I fear my poor Marian is wor[s]e than dead. A gentleman has found means to en[s]nare her innocent un[s]u[s]pecting heart, and [s]he has this morning left her only friends to tru[s]t the promi[s]es of one [s]he never [s]aw till three days [s]ince. I know not how to return to my poor mother with the[s]e fatal tidings, I fear it will go near to break an heart already oppre[s][s]ed with woes almost too heavy to be borne. "But God tempereth the wind to the [s]horn lamb," continued [s]he, rai[s]ing her eyes to heaven, and no doubt will inspire her with fortitude to bear, wihout repining, this heavie[s]t of his trials. The [s]tranger reverenced her [s]orrow, he took her pa[s][s]ive hand, drew it under his arm, and [s]o proceeded [s]ilently along towards Dorcas's cottage; he attempted not to interrupt her grief, but now and then a tear [s]tole down his manly cheeks, and a re[s]pon[s]ive [s]igh an[s]wered hers. When they arrived at the cottage Dorcas met them at the door; Lydia flew towards her, folded her arms round her neck, and dropping her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] head on her bo[s]om, [s]obbed aloud. Oh! my beloved, [s]aid Dorcas, tell me, has any accident happened to your [s]i[s]ter? She is gone, [s]aid Lydia. What, forever? cried the fond mother eagerly. Oh! my dear mother, [s]he is lo[s]t to us; that gentleman whom we met--- Enough, [s]aid Dorcas, I fully under[s]tand the extent of my misfortune; my Marian is dishonored, plunged in infamy; but I will not renounce her, [s]he is my child. Oh! heavens, none but a parent can judge of the angui[s]h that now harrows up my [s]oul. But, my [s]weet Lydia, will you for[s]ake your mother in her old age, will you leave her grey hairs to [s]ink in [s]orrow to the grave, without a friend to chear her la[s]t moments, without the gentle hand of filial love to clo[s]e her dying eyes. Oh! no, cried Lydia, dropping on her knees, never, never; when I for[s]ake my honor'd mother, may heaven regardle[s]s hear me when I pray, may I be ca[s]t out to [s]ickne[s]s, pain and poverty, without a friend to pity or relieve me. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] Dorcas embraced her, and the [s]tranger endeavoured to di[s][s]ipate the drops of humanity which were gathering in her eyes. Lydia by degrees became more compo[s]ed, and informed her mother of the obligations [s]he was under to the gentleman who had accompanied her home. Oh! Sir, [s]aid Dorcas, you are my friend and benefactor, had I lo[s]t my Lydia I had lo[s]t my all; but [s]ay, by what name [s]hall I remember you in my prayers? They call me Renfew, Earl of Landaff, [s]aid he. Dorcas [s]tarted and turned pale---the Earl continued, Your [s]orrow has awakened in my brea[s]t every feeling of humanity, and if it is in my power to be of any [s]ervice to you, command me, and I will exert it to the utmo[s]t. Alas! my dear Marian! [s]aid Dorcas. I under[s]tand you, replied the Earl, and wi[s]h I could re[s]tore her to you, but as that is not in my power, teach me by [s]ome other means to promote your happine[s]s. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] My Lord, [s]aid Dorcas, there is but one way to give the lea[s]t [s]atisfaction to this afflicted heart; leave the cottage immediately, nor ever attempt again to [s]ee or conver[s]e with Lydia. And why this cruel re[s]triction? Time, my Lord, perhaps may inform you with my rea[s]ons for acting thus. At pre[s]ent I cannot alledge the true cau[s]e, and will never [s]toop to a mean equivocation to excu[s]e an action, which I am [s]en[s]ible is perfectly right. The Earl was piqued, he bowed and left the cottage. Lydia, [s]aid Dorcas, if you love your mother, you will avoid the Earl of Landaff. He is generous and humane, [s]aid Lydia, Tru[s]t not to appearances, replied her mother, when you [s]hall learn a tale which I could tell you, you will then, like me, tremble at the name of Renfew. Peace, with the [s]peed of a courier, now fled from the man[s]ion of Dorcas, affliction u[s]urped her place, and with [s]olemn pace each night walled with the [s]olitary Lydia over tho[s]e fields an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] meadows where [s]he once had cheerfully tripped with her beloved Marian. In one of the[s]e melancholy excur[s]ions [s]he was acco[s]ted by the Earl of Landaff; [s]he would have fled, but he prevented her, and in the mo[s]t eloquent language true love could in[s]pire, told her how dear [s]he was to him, and how cruel he thought her mother, in refu[s]ing him the plea[s]ure of her conver[s]ation. My mother, replied Lydia, can be actuated by no motive but a wi[s]h to promote my happine[s]s. I e[s]teem you, my Lord, I [s]hall ever remember you with gratitude, but my mother has forbid me to hold any cover[s]ation with you. Adieu, Sir, I often think of you, but will never have any intercour[s]e with you. Stay, my [s]weet Lydia, [s]aid the Earl, only [s]ay you do not hate me. I [s]wear, dear maid, my designs are honorable, and if you will put your[s]elf under my protection, a private marriage [s]hall convince you how [s]incere my profe[s][s]ions are. My Lord, replied Lydia, though I acknowledge my[s]elf honored by this declaration, I mu[s]t decline accepting your offer; I know my rank in life is far beneath what would be expected in the bride of Landaff, but humble as I am, I will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] never become the wife of a man who would be a[s]hamed publicly to own me as [s]uch; nor will I ever clande[s]tinely conver[s]e with a per[s]on whom my mother has forbid me to [s]ee. My [s]i[s]ter, I fear, by her di[s]obedience, has rendered her[s]elf mi[s]erable, nor will I, by a like conduct, increa[s]e the affliction of my dear venerable parent. Landaff expatiated on the many advantages attending wealth and [s]plendor; Lydia heard him with [s]ilent contempt. He told her his only wi[s]h was, to make her happy. That is impo[s][s]ible, my Lord, [s]aid [s]he, the heart of Lydia never can know happine[s]s while her mother is in affliction, and her [s]i[s]ter, perhaps, a mi[s]erable wanderer, expo[s]ed to all the wretchedness, want and infamy can entail on a fallen woman. All farther per[s]ua[s]ion was of no effect, Lydia continued firm in her re[s]olution of not leaving her mother, and fearful of again meeting the importunate Earl, avoided for [s]ome time her favorite walk, confined her[s]elf to the narrow limits of their garden, and devoted her time entirely to comfort and chear her afflicted parent. The Earl finding no hope of [s]ucce[s]s in drawing Lydia from her duty, and having too much [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-124.jpg) \- external link  - Blank Page. ] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] riches and finery, to which [s]he had hitherto been unaccu[s]tomed, to en[s]nare and lead her an ea[s]y victim to be [s]acrificed at the [s]hrine of vice. To this end he forbore taking any liberty during their journey which might alarm her, treated her with re[s]pect and tender attention, and when they arrived in London placed her in an elegant lodging, with proper [s]ervants to wait on her, and left her to ruminate at lei[s]ure on the change in her situation. The female attendant who was immediately about the per[s]on of Marian, was a girl who had formerly fallen a prey to the arts of Sir George, and now only enjoyed his bounty for reducing other haple[s]s females to the horrid level with her[s]elf. She was wretched in the lo[s]s of her own virtue, and like the [s]poiler of mankind, exulted in every opportunity of robbing others of that ble[s][s]ing herself could no longer enjoy. She treated the innocent Marian with the mo[s]t profound re[s]pect, led her through a [s]uit of [s]uperb apartments and told her; if [s]he could think of any thing that would add to the elegance or beauty of the furniture, [s]he need only mention her wi[s]hes to have them complied with. She next di[s]played a variety of elegant female apparel, toys, jewels, and other things proper to catch the attention of inexperienced youth, and kindle the glowing [s]eeds of vanity into a flame that might con[s]ume her, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] at that time was without a favorite, and from the prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ion he felt in his bo[s]om towards our poor wanderer, he determined to rai[s]e her from the abject [s]tate to which [s]he was reduced, to the honorable [s]tation of his mi[s]tre[s]s; he therefore di[s]patched his vi[s]its as quick as po[s][s]ible, and repaired to the place of appointment. Marian met him at the door of the apartment, he gave her his hand, [s]he rai[s]ed it to her lips, and attempted to [s]peak, but words were refu[s]ed, a gu[s]h of [s]ilent tears more eloquently [s]poke her [s]oul's meaning--the Major was moved, he made her [s]it, down, and placing him[s]elf be[s]ide her, began to unfold the de[s]igns he had formed in her favour. Alas! Sir, [s]aid Marian mournfully, I had hoped you would have taken me from this life of [s]hame, indeed I am [s]ick of what is termed plea[s]ure, I long to [s]ink into peaceful ob[s]curity, and having ju[s]t [s]ufficient to [s]upply the wants of nature, repent my pa[s]t mi[s]deeds, and wait with patience the appointed hour of re[s]t. I know not why it is, but I feel I never can return your genero[s]ity in the way you require, and therefore dare not hope for farther favours. Nay, my dear girl, [s]aid the Major, this is affectation; come [s]hake off this gloom which your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] misfortunes have occa[s]ioned to envelope your mind---what, though I am an old man, I will teach you to love me. Oh! Sir, replied Marian, you have taught me that already, there is nothing which I [s]hould think too hard to perform, to convince you of the grateful affections of my heart. But I had hoped this [s]inking fragile frame never would have known pollution more. The Major endeavoured to calm the perturbation of her [s]pirits, and pre[s][s]ed her to partake of [s]ome excellent champaigne which he had ordered with the [s]upper. Marian was thoughtful, eat, little, and frequently turned her head to hide the [s]tarting tears. Supper removed he renewed his [s]olicitations, [s]he [s]unk on her knees, and with uplifted hands entreated him to grant her relief on other terms, or [s]uffer her to leave him, and again tempt the mi[s]eries of her hard de[s]tiny. He was deaf to her prayers, he attributed them to art--he rai[s]ed her from the ground, and proceeded to unwarrantable liberties--[s]he made a violent effort, and [s]pringing from his arms, cried, Oh! Dorcas, dear unhappy mother, why did I leave you,--then ru[s]hing out of the room, ran precipitately into the [s]treet. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] The exclamation which [s]he made had thrown the Major into a [s]tupor of a[s]toni[s]hment, every faculty was [s]u[s]pended, nor could he recover [s]ufficient recollection to endeavour to [s]top her-- a thou[s]and pa[s]t occurrences ru[s]hed upon his mind, and he remained immoveable, his eyes rivetted to the door through which [s]he had pa[s][s]ed. At length recovering from his [s]urpri[s]e, he observed a [s]mall [s]hagreen ca[s]e which lay on the floor, and during her [s]truggles had dropped from Marian's bo[s]om. He took it up, with emotion opened it, and the portrait of Dorcas met his eyes. The ca[s]e dropped from his unnerved hand, he groaned and fell [s]en[s]ele[s]s to the floor, the noi[s]e of his fall brought up a [s]ervant of the hou[s]e, proper remedies were applied and [s]oon re[s]tored him to a keen [s]en[s]e of his pa[s]t guilt and treachery to Dorcas, for Major Renfew was the perjured hu[s]band whom Dorcas had concealed under the name of Melfont. The fir[s]t thought that [s]truck him was the horrid crime he had [s]o nearly perpetrated; the next was what was become of his poor ruined child--- His continual ravings for his Marian, his dear lo[s]t daughter, and the evident incoherence of his di[s]cour[s]e led the [s]ervants to believe he was fiezed with a [s]udden fit of in[s]anity, and in that belief conveyed him home. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] The horror that dwelt upon his mind, and the violent agitation brought on a fever, and before morning he was in[s]en[s]ible to all that pa[s][s]ed about him. Before rea[s]on entirely for[s]ook him, he was vi[s]ited by the Earl of Landaff, who was his nephew, to him he unfolded the dreadful tale, conjuring him to try every po[s][s]ible method to di[s]cover the unhappy wanderer. Oh! [s]aid he in an agony, "[s]he knelt and prayed, my child entreated me, with [s]treaming eyes, to [s]natch her from infamy, and I would not hear her,----[s]eek her Landaff, find her, [s]ave her from peri[s]hing for want." The remembrance was too acute, and his [s]en[s]es, which were before wavering, took their flight--but [s]till his fancy was haunted by the image of Dorcas and Marian, and his agonies became dreadful, even to tho[s]e who attended him. Every enquiry after the haple[s]s Marian was fruitle[s]s, and the mi[s]erable Renfew, when a turn of his di[s]order re[s]tored him to rea[s]on, found that there was no hope of recovering the poor wanderer--- The picture di[s]covered to the Earl of Landaff that Dorcas was the mother and Lydia the [s]i[s]ter of the woman who had cau[s]ed [s]uch anxious emotions in his uncle's bo[s]om, but how Lydia and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] Marian [s]hould be the daughters of Major Renfew appeared to him an inexplicable riddle. His uncle [s]oon unravelled the my[s]tery, and received [s]ome con[s]olation from hearing that Dorcas was living, and that he might hope to embrace one innocent child, in his Lydia. He determined to [s]eek Dorcas in her [s]olitude, and acknowledge her to the world as his fir[s]t and only true affianced wife; but fearing to alarm her by too abrupt an appearance, he addre[s][s]ed her fir[s]t by letter. - By what title [s]hall I addre[s]s you, dear injured excellence, but by that which mu[s]t make me appear what I really am---the vile[s]t, the ba[s]e[s]t of mankind.--- Oh! Dorcas, cruel as my conduct was to you, my puni[s]hment, I tru[s]t, has been equal to my fault---alas! the crimes of the father have been vi[s]ited upon the child. Oh! my beloved, will not your gentle heart break when I [s]hall tell you I have [s]een our dear Marian---I have [s]een her a wretched nightly wanderer---I heard her implore charity, I [s]aw her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] overpowered with angui[s]h of heart, and relieved her not, but drove her from me, drove her again upon the mercile[s]s world, expo[s]ed to all the mi[s]eries of want!---But my old tough heart will not bur[s]t, though it [s]wells and throbs at the remembrance of that dreadful evening. My Dorcas, I will do you ju[s]tice, I will declare to the world your injuries and my own per[s]idy. Prepare my love, to meet your penitent Renfew [s]oon after the receipt of this, and bid my [s]weet, my innocent Lydia, prepare to receive a father's ble[s][s]ing. Adieu. Many days [s]hall not pa[s]s e'er I hope to hear you pronounce my pardon, and cla[s]p you to the heart of your repentant hu[s]band, RENFEW. From the day of Marian's elopement plea[s]ure had been a [s]tranger to the heart of Dorcas, nor could all the duteous tenderne[s]s of Lydia dissipate the anxiety [s]he felt for the fate of Marian from her maternal brea[s]t. Nor did joy now [s]parkle in the eye of Lydia, the tear of [s]orrow had quenched their lu[s]tre, and like a cankerworm had fed upon her cheek, and [s]tole from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] thence the blu[s]hing ro[s]e. Full oft [s]he wept her haple[s]s [s]i[s]ter's fall, full oft [s]he [s]ighed and wi[s]hed to hear again of Landaff, but her tears fell only on her pillow, when the [s]able curtain of night hid them from the prying eye of maternal affection, and her [s]ighs [s]tole forth when no one was nigh to hear them.

[s]aid [s]he, [s]ighing deeply. I will [s]ing you your favorite hymn, [s]aid Lydia, ki[s][s]ing off a tear as it fell on her mother's cheek, and [s]truggling to [s]uppre[s]s its [s]ympathi[s]ing [s]i[s]ter that trembled in her own eye. She took up her guitar, [s]he wi[s]hed to divert her mother's attention from the painful reflections which then occupied her thoughts; [s]he pa[s][s]ed her fingers acro[s]s the [s]trings, the tones were di[s]cordant, it is not in tune, [s]aid [s]he. Alas! my dear Lydia, replied her mother, it is our minds that are not harmonized. She under[s]tood the meaning of her mother's words, but, making no an[s]wer, began to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] [s]ing an evening hymn of thanks. The [s]udden trampling of a hor[s]e interrupted her, a loud rapping at the door alarmed them---Lydia opened the door, a [s]ervant entered. Dorcas looked earne[s]tly at him; he threw a[s]ide his riding coat, [s]he knew the livery, and in[s]tantly recognized an old and favorite [s]ervant of Major Renfew. Simon, [s]aid [s]he, turning pale and ri[s]ing as [s]he [s]poke, why are you here? My dear honored lady, I come from my master, who repents his injurious treatment of you, and comes to do you ju[s]tice; but let this letter [s]peak for him. And where is Lady Laura, [s]aid Dorcas, taking the letter. She left my ma[s]ter [s]ome years [s]ince, and now leads a life of [s]hame. Poor mi[s]guided Laura, [s]aid Dorcas, as the broke the [s]eal. When [s]he read the fir[s]t lines joy lightened her features, and a tran[s]ient glow of plea[s]ure acro[s]s her face; but as [s]he proceeded trembled, her countenance a[s][s]umed a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] ly hue, and large drops of unutterable angui[s]h, cha[s]ed each other down her cheeks---the letter fell to the ground, [s]he cla[s]ped her hands and rai[s]ed her eyes towards heaven. Omnipotent power, [s]aid [s]he, teach me to receive the[s]e tidings as I ought, thy mercies and thy judgments go hand in hand. Oh! make me thankful for the one and [s]ubmi[s][s]ive to the other. Thou ha[s]t mingled thy judgments and thy bounties in my cup of life; le[s]t while receiving only benefits I [s]hould forget the [s]ource from whence tho[s]e mercies flow. Lydia, continued [s]he, you will receive a father's ble[s][s]ing, but my poor Marian is lo[s]t for ever. Two days after Major Renfew had di[s]patched the letter to Dorcas, he [s]et forward for Wales, accompanied by the Earl of Landaff; it was nearly the clo[s]e of the third day, they had arrived within a few miles of the cottage, and had slackened their pace, that a [s]ervant might have time to inform Dorcas of their near approach. The Major's bo[s]om was agitated by the mo[s]t painful [s]en[s]ations, the Earl was animated by hope. The road was [s]olitary, [s]kirted on one [s]ide by a thick wood, from whence they [s]everal times imagined they heard a voice of complaint, the his hor[s]e and [s]tood in the attitude of ing. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] Ah! woe is me, [s]aid the voice, I can get no farther, I mu[s]t e'en peri[s]h here. Landaff di[s]mounted in[s]tantly and ru[s]hed into the wood, the Major would have followed but a [s]udden pang [s]eized him, he re[s]pired with difficulty and was forced to [s]upport him[s]elf again a tree. In a few moments Landaff returned, a female re[s]ted on his arm, her emaciated frame but [s]lenderly [s]heltered from the inclemencies of the weather, by a tattered gown; her hair loo[s]e and di[s]hevelled, her feet bare and bleeding from wounds [s]he had received from [s]harp [s]tones, as [s]he walked. Here is a [s]ight of mi[s]ery, [s]aid the Earl. The Major looked at the unhappy girl, and through the [s]hade which extreme want, sickness, and even di[s]ordered rea[s]on had ca[s]t over her countenance, in[s]tantly di[s]covered the seatures of Marian. Merciful heaven, he exclaimed, it is my child. Have you a child, [s]aid Marian, catching at his la[s]t words, then for pity's [s]ake don't for[s]ake her. I had a father once, I had a lover too; but you [s]ee how it is with me now, I am poor, very [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] wretched, and I [s]ometimes think not quite in my right [s]en[s]es. I have a mother who lives somewhere here about, I have travelled a long way in hopes to find her, but I know not how it is, I have eat [s]o little, and wept [s]o much, I was obliged to [s]it down and re[s]t. Do but [s]ee how my poor feet bleed. Oh! my dear child, cried the Major, you make my heart bleed drop for drop with them; but I am going to your mother's, and will [s]hew you the way. You are a man, [s]aid [s]he, and I dare not tru[s]t you; they are all hard-hearted, cruel and treacherous. I once, continued [s]he, looking earnestly in the Major's face, I once met a man, but 'tis a long time [s]ince, who looked and [s]poke as you do, only not quite [s]o [s]orrowful---I was mi[s]erable then, and he promi[s]ed to be my friend, but he did not mean it; he u[s]ed me very cruelly, I hardly know how I got from him, and have been wandering about ever [s]ince, [s]ometimes one cold [s]tone, [s]ometimes another has been my pillow. I bear it as well as I can, we all mu[s]t [s]uffer according to our offences. Dear lunatic, [s]aid the Major, what a le[s][s]on do[s]t thou teach thy father. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] That is true, [s]aid [s]he, you have a child, if it is a daughter, bring her to me, and I will teach her [s]uch a le[s][s]on---I have it here (laying her hand on her heart) it can never be era[s]ed but by the hand of death. Oh! I would tell her [s]uch tales of men, would teach her to beware their flattery, to [s]hut her[s]elf in retirement, to pray for humility. Oh! [s]ye upon it, [s]ye upon it, 'tis a bad world, but I'll to my mother, for I am [s]ick, heart-[s]ick of its [s]ollies. She then darted precipitately into the wood, but had not proceeded many [s]teps, when overcome with fatigue, long fa[s]ting, and the agitation of her di[s]ordered [s]pirits, [s]he [s]unk under the complicated evils, and fell fainting to the ground. Renfew was too much ab[s]orbed in his own feelings to be able to give any orders concerning his unhappy daughter, and could only exclaim, "The[s]e are thy works, oh vice; look, old Renfew, behold the ruin of thy child, and remember 'tis the reward of thy own ingratitude, per[s]idy and cruelty." Landaff a[s][s]i[s]ted the [s]ervants in rai[s]ing Marian, and being then but a [s]hort di[s]tance from the cottage, per[s]uaded his uncle to ride forward, accompanied by one [s]ervant, while he followed with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] the other two [s]upporting Marian between them. And is this the peace offering I [s]hall carry to my afflicted Dorcas, a daughter murdered by the inhumanity of a father, [s]aid the Major as he proceeded. Dorcas had been li[s]tening to every pa[s][s]ing breeze, and counting the minutes, chiding their tardy progre[s]s. The [s]ound of hor[s]es feet caught her ear, [s]he met her repentant Renfew at the door, threw her[s]elf into his arms, and fainted. Lydia knelt and received a father's ble[s][s]ing. Words are too languid to de[s]cribe the ensuing [s]cene, [s]uffice it to [s]ay, for Marian was for a moment forgot, for a moment they were all happy; but they were awakened from this dream of bli[s]s by the approach of Landaff. Lydia [s]tarted as [s]he drew near the door, Renfew [s]truck his forehead with his hand, and bur[s]ting from the embraces of Dorcas, ru[s]hed out of the room. Marian was beginning to recover her fen[s]es as they entered the cottage. Lydia thought it was a [s]tranger, poor and [s]ickly, and as [s]he lent her arm to a[s][s]i[s]t in leading her in, a tear fell in compa[s][s]ion to her weakne[s]s and appatent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] misery. Marian [s]unk into a chair, folded her arms round Lydia's wai[s]t, and gazing at her for a moment, recollection and rea[s]on at once returned, [s]he dropped her head on her bo[s]om and cried, it is indeed my [s]i[s]ter. The voice was familiar to Dorcas. That voice [s]hould be the voice of Marian, [s]aid [s]he, but alas! the form retains no traces of my once lovely innocent child. Innocence and peace are fled together, [s]aid Marian, grant me but pardon and let medie at your feet; [s]he [s]unk upon her knees, Lydia knelt be[s]ide her; the afflicted mother wept over her, ble[s][s]ed and forgave her. Enough, [s]aid Marian, this was the only prayer I dared to offer at the throne of grace [s]ince I left my home, and became acquainted with guilt and mi[s]ery; how it has plea[s]ed heaven to direct me to you I know not. I have [s]ome faint recollection of an horrid dream, but all things [s]eem fading from my memory, an icy chillne[s]s hangs about my heart, I feel the [s]prings of life are quite exhau[s]ted. Oh! [s]pare her, [s]pare my child, merciful heaven, cried Dorcas, [s]inking on her knees. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] It cannot be, [s]aid the expiring [s]ufferer, I die, but a mother's ble[s][s]ing [s]oftens even the agonies of death, Oh! had I but de[s]erved it. She rai[s]ed her hands and eyes in a fervent though inarticulate ejaculation to heaven, and uttering a piercing groan expired. Renfew heard the groan, he heard the cries of Dorcas and Lydia---"And is [s]he dead, [s]aid he, ru[s]hing in and catching the pale cor[s]e in his arms, Oh! Marian! Marian! why [s]houlde[s]t thou pay the forfeit of thy father's crimes? But tell me, continued he, who was her [s]educer; who plunged my child into this aby[s]s of mi[s]ery; teach me where to find him, that with his heart's blood I may wa[s]h out the [s]tain he has entailed upon the name of Renfew." Forbear, [s]aid Dorcas, laying her hand upon his arm, while a beam of mingled piety and fortitude illumined her countenance, forbear, the hand of heaven is in it, accept its ju[s]t chastisements with humility, and remembering only thine own offences, blot from thy memory the offences of others. Renfew turned from her, folded his arms upon his bo[s]om, and was [s]ilent.

She was the ble[s][s]ing of her parents, the pride and honor of her hu[s]band, the friend and preceptre[s]s of her children, who repaid an hundred fold the plea[s]ure [s]he had conveyed to Dorcas's bo[s]om by [s]hewing the [s]ame duty and affection to her. Major Renfew purcha[s]ed the cottage where his wife and children had lived [s]o many years, and kept it in con[s]tant repair; in the garden he had two [s]mall temples erected, one was almo[s]t hid from the eye, by thick [s]preading cypre[s]s and yew trees, round who[s]e branches twined the deadly night-[s]hade, and baleful ivy; within was a tomb of black marble, over which [s]tood Humanity weeping; on the front of the monument was the following in[s]cription: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] Hither let the Daughter of Vanity repair, Look on this [s]ilent Monitor, AND REMEMBER MARIAN!

Beware the voice of flattery, beware the allurements of wealth, nor a[s]k of thy bountiful Creator aught but HUMILITY, VIRTUE AND CONTENT. The other temple was built of white marble, [s]urrounded by the mo[s]t beautiful flowering [s]hrubs and evergreens; within was Peace and Pro[s]perity, thowering their favors on filial piety; above covered an Angel with a crown of gold in her hands, round which was this heavenly promi[s]e.

Fye, my dear girls, I am a[s]hamed to read [s]o very childi[s]h an apolegy, your want of time mu[s]t proceed from your own bad management, for [s]urely no rational being will give more to the pur[s]uit of amu[s]ement than what might ju[s]t [s]erve to give a ze[s]t to retirement; and, believe me, you will find retirement alone the [s]ource of true happine[s]s, and promoter of industry--- and on the contrary, an eager pur[s]uit of fa[s]hionable folly, which [s]educes you under the [s]emblance of plea[s]ure, always tends to debilitate the faculties of the mind, and lead you into habits of idlene[s]s and indolence at once prejudicial to your tranquillity and intere[s]t, not only your temporal, but what is of far more con[s]equence, your [s]piritual intere[s]t.

Ah! my young friends, I fear but a little, very little portion is allotted for that [s]ervice; yet tru[s]t me it is a [s]ervice which cannot be neglected but by the ungrateful and unthinking. Is there one moment of your lives that pa[s][s]es unmarked by his ble[s][s]ings? Have you not health, chearfulne[s]s, friends, and the mo[s]t valuable of all ble[s][s]ings, the power to dry the tear of affliction, to comfort the widow, protect the orphan, relea[s]e the poor debtor, and perform all the good works of peace and mercy? How [s]hould your hearts overflow with gratitude to that God, who thus bountifully [s]preads around you the means of happine[s]s, do not then my dear children, throw the ble[s][s]ing from you, and continue [s]quandering your time, and trifling with your health 'till the fir[s]t is nearly [s]pent, and the latter irretrievably ruined, and you will awaken too late to a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of your error, when your mind, evervated by the weakne[s]s of your frame, vainly [s]hall endeavour in the few remaining years to regain tho[s]e [s]ources of mental delight which ever flow from a proper exertion of the rea[s]oning faculties.

I hear you readily an[s]wer no. Every moment was fully and plea[s]antly employed; true, but had we not always time for reading, writing, mu[s]ic, drawing, needle-work, and every other amu[s]ing or u[s]eful employment. And did we ever, my dear girls, ri[s]e from the [s]weets of repo[s]e, or retire to our chambers at night, without remembering our duty to him through who[s]e mercy alone we enjoyed all tho[s]e ble[s][s]ings? and certain I am, you were at that time as happy as it was po[s][s]ible for young people to be; you were blithe as the woodlark, blooming as Hebe, and innocent as the dove, who tries his new fledged wings in little circles round its mother's ne[s]t. Think not, my young friends, that I wi[s]h to deprive you of innocent amu[s]ement, far from it. In the [s]phere where it has plea[s]ed providence to place you, it is certainly right that you [s]hould partake in moderation of all the diver[s]ions of the metropolis; but if tho[s]e diver[s]ions are too frequently repeated, they lo[s]e their effect, and you return from them weary, di[s]gu[s]ted and dissatisfied. But how different are the plea[s]ures ari[s]ing from the amu[s]ement to be found within our[s]elves. The pur[s]uit of either of the fine arts, the [s]tudy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] of nature, in all her varieties and beauties, the excellencies of chri[s]tianity, the delights ari[s]ing from benevolence---here are inexhau[s]tible [s]ources of entertainment, rational [s]ublime plea[s]ure, that the farther you pur[s]ue it, the more enchanting appears the pro[s]pect, new charms ari[s]e to your astonished view; and though the joys of youth transiently fleet away, you will [s]till have plea[s]ures within your reach, that can render old age not only ea[s]y to your[s]elf, but delightful to others. I am no [s]tranger to the many enticements youth and inexperience meet with in the gay world to allure them from the paths of rea[s]on. I my[s]elf [s]pent my youth in London, but it was my lot to be placed in a family, where nothing was deemed plea[s]ure, however [s]pecious its appearance, that was not [s]anctioned by rea[s]on. Your grandmother, my dear girls, was a woman remarkable for the elegance of her manners and the chearfulne[s]s of her di[s]po[s]ition; yet believe me [s]he was as truly pious as a primitive chri[s]tian. Surrounded with affluence, [s]he was humble, benevolent, tender hearted, and ea[s]y of acce[s]s to the meane[s]t petitioner. In affliction re[s]igned, patient and uncomplaining. When it was fir[s]t my happy fate to be taken under her protection, [s]he was [s]carcely twenty-[s]ix [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] years old, extremely lovely in her per[s]on, endowed with every accompli[s]hment, admired wherever [s]he appeared, re[s]pected by her friends, and adored by her hu[s]band: yet [s]he was not tainted by vanity, but made it her [s]tudy to conciliate e[s]teem, when love and admiration [s]hould be no more. She paid a [s]trict attention to her dome[s]tic affairs, attended per[s]onally to the morals and education of her children, never suffered an hour to pa[s]s unemployed, or a day without paying her devotion to her maker.

Be[s]ides, you [s]hould reflect that your father having di[s]charged his duty towards you, by giving you a liberal education, and remaining unmarried till you have attained to years of maturity, has now an undoubted right to plea[s]e him[s]elf, and chu[s]e a companion [s]uited to his age and di[s]po[s]ition.---And [s]hall you, the children of his affection, who[s]e happine[s]s he has [s]o much [s]tudied, who[s]e felicity is the fir[s]t wi[s]h of his heart, [s]hall you ungratefully murmur at his choice, and by your di[s]content embitter the life of him it is your duty to love and reverence. No, no.---I think my dear girls know too well the many obligations they are under to this dear father, to attempt any thing which would be prejudicial to his happine[s]s. Con[s]ider, my dear girls, how much it will be your intere[s]t to endeavour to conciliate the affection and e[s]teem of the woman whom your father thinks proper to place in [s]o re[s]pectable a [s]ituation. You mu[s]t regard her as the repre[s]entative of your decea[s]ed parent, and by tender a[s][s]duity and attention, make her your [s]incere friend; [s]uch a conduct will make you dearer than ever to the heart of your father, and a delightful tranquillity will diffu[s]e it[s]elf through your own bo[s]oms, con[s]cious that to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] utmo[s]t of your power you have performed your duty. Perhaps you may tell me, there is no actual duty due to a [s]tep-mother. I confe[s]s it is not [s]o much a duty incumbent for you to obey the commands or [s]ubmit implicitly to the will of any but your natural parent, but remember my fair friends, if you voluntarily perform an exalted action, where perhaps it was not expected, and could not be demanded, how much more will it redound to your honor, than the [s]imple discharge of an obligation. I am [s]en[s]ible that many young women have been rendered extremely unhappy by their father's choo[s]ing [s]econd wives, but then it has been the error of judgment in his choice; where passion has [s]o blinded him that he could not di[s]cover the faults of the per[s]on who had attracted his affection. Perhaps [s]he has been ignorant, ill-natured, illiberal, or fanta[s]tic; nay, it has been the unhappy fate of [s]ome girls to have for a [s]tep-mother, a per[s]on in whom all tho[s]e disagreeable circum[s]tances are combined. But what a different choice has your father made, Mrs. Clairville is elegant, accompli[s]hed, gentle and unassuming. She will render your father's evening of life like the parting rays of a mild autumn day, where though we cannot but [s]ee the vi[s]ible [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] approach of winter, there is [s]uch a [s]o[s]t [s]erenity, [s]uch various beauties [s]cattered over the pro[s]pect, that the reflecting mind cannot but prefer it to the more gaudy tints that embelli[s]h the appearance of [s]pring. Your own [s]elicity too may be augmented by this union, as I am certain, however vanity or folly may for a moment mi[s]lead your understanding, you will all [s]incerely rejoice in an event that will ultimately tend to in[s]ure the mo[s]t refined plea[s]ure to [s]o good, [s]o valuable a father, as Lord Winworth, by uniting him to a woman, who[s]e highly cultivated under[s]tanding renders her at once the chearful rational companion, and the di[s]intere[s]ted friend. You may remember, my dear girls, how unkind you thought me, when I po[s]itively refu[s]ed to accompany you to London; perhaps you may now perceive the ju[s]tice of that refu[s]al. Had I complied with the polite invitation of your father, and yielded my own better judgment to your pre[s][s]ing entreaties, I [s]hould have undoubtedly long ago forfeited, in your opinion, all right to your affection. Some years before Lord Winworth beheld your truly amiable mother, he [s]o far humbled him[s]elf as to make me a tender of his hand and fortune. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] will not dwell on the rea[s]on that urged me to refuse an offer [s]o very far above my de[s]erts, lea[s]t my dear Mi[s]s Winworths [s]hould think I boa[s]ted of my great fortitude and re[s]olution; believe me, it was only an exertion of rea[s]on, and I felt amply compen[s]ated for all I [s]uffered in this [s]elf-denial, (for I will not deny that my heart pleaded strongly in your father's favor) by the reflection that I had acted with honour and propriety, and evinced the [s]incerity of my gratitude to my dear benefactre[s]s. Affections that have been deeply impre[s][s]ed on our hearts in extreme youth, are often revived again at the remote period of mature age, and I feared to lo[s]e the friend[s]hip of my young friends, by awakening in the bo[s]om of their father the tenderness he once honored me with, by profe[s][s]ing---. Before I drop this [s]ubject, I will give you two in[s]tances that have fell under my own immediate knowledge, to [s]hew you how very po[s][s]ible it is for an ob[s]tinate misjudging child to trifle away both her own and father's happine[s]s, by being wilfully blind to the merits of his [s]econd wife; and al[s]o [s]hew how truly amiable the daughter mu[s]t appear, who makes the tranquillity of her parent her chief [s]tudy; and if her own peace is in [s]ome mea[s]ure interrupted by the caprice of a [s]tep mother, [s]he will [s]eek in re[s]ignation, piety and humility, a [s]weet con[s]olation and comfort.

Mr. Markham was doatingly fond of his daughter, he placed his chief felicity in the hope of one day [s]eeing her the mo[s]t amiable, accompli[s]hed and happy girl in England. He had placed her at an eminent boarding [s]chool, but he knew too much of the world to [s]uppo[s]e, a girl of her volatile di[s]po[s]ition, especially when [s]he was lovely in her per[s]on, and reputed heire[s]s to a large fortune, could be [s]o [s]afe any where as under the immediate protection of a father. He had no female relation whom he could with propriety invite to his hou[s]e, and he thought he could not do his daughter a more acceptable [s]ervice, than by choo[s]ing the amiable Mi[s]s Nel[s]on to pre[s]ide in the place of her departed mother. Mi[s]s Nel[s]on was at that time upwards of thirty, [s]he had rendered her[s]elf univer[s]ally beloved and re[s]pected by all who knew her, for the innate goodne[s]s of her heart was con[s]picuous in every action. She had received a mo[s]t liberal education, and her mental endowments were far [s]uperior to the generality of what is termed accompli[s]hed women---yet [s]o timid and una[s][s]uming in her manners, that tho[s]e with whom [s]he conver[s]ed by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] degrees di[s]covered her excellencies, and after [s]ome years acquaintance would be daily finding [s]omething new to admire. She had by the mo[s]t exemplary conduct as a daughter, convinced the world what might be expected from her as a wife and mother. She was uniformly humane, pious and gentle; in per[s]on attractive, and in manners elegantly [s]imple. Such was the woman whom Mr. Markham thought would help to form the manners, cultivate the under[s]tanding, and direct the [s]tudies of his darling Celia. Mi[s]s Markham no [s]ooner was informed of her father's intended union, than [s]he conceived the mo[s]t violent and ill founded di[s]like toward the innocent object of his affection. As Celia was [s]o young, Mr. Markham never had an idea of con[s]ulting her on his propo[s]ed marriage, having therefore obtained from Mi[s]s Nelson leave to name an early day for the ceremony, he wrote to his daughter an affectionate letter, informing her how much he had [s]tudied her happiness in providing her [s]o amiable a friend and preceptre[s]s, at the [s]ame time reque[s]ting her governess to prepare her to be pre[s]ent at the wedding. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] Celia was a girl of high [s]pirits, her understanding had remained entirely uncultivated, while large [s]ums had been expended on the far le[s]s necessary [s]uperficial accompli[s]hments of mu[s]ic, dancing, drawing, and fancy works. Religion [s]he knew but by name; it is true, there were prayers read twice a-day in the [s]chool, and [s]he went with the other ladies regularly to church twice every Sunday, but there it re[s]ted! There had been no pains taken to in[s]til into her mind a true knowledge of what religion meant; [s]he had not been taught that to keep her pa[s][s]ions under the controul of rea[s]on, to [s]ubmit, without repining, to the will of tho[s]e whom heaven had placed over her; to be meek, merciful, and ju[s]t, and let every action of her life be a continued work of gratitude to heaven, and good will to her fellow creatures, was to follow the precepts of true piety. She had been early taught to value her[s]elf, upon the trifling advantages of birth and fortune, for [s]he [s]aw the vi[s]ible difference between the attention and re[s]pect paid by her governe[s]s and the teachers to her[s]elf and tho[s]e young ladies who had neither of tho[s]e advantages to recommend them. She was naturally vain, and that vanity was augmented by the con[s]tant adulation which [s]he daily received from tho[s]e girls, who[s]e meanne[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] of [s]pirit induced them to cringe to her [s]uperior wealth. From con[s]tantly contemplating tho[s]e fancied endowments, [s]he began to imagine [s]he was born for univer[s]al [s]way, had [s]ettled it in her own mind, that in a few years [s]he [s]hould be called home to pre[s]ide at her father's table, have the management of the family, and partake of all the fashionable plea[s]ures with which the metropolis abounds. How great then was her di[s]appointment when [s]he found all the[s]e plea[s]ing expectations at once fru[s]trated---when [s]he found [s]he was to be [s]till considered as a child, and under the controul of the mo[s]t dreaded of all characters, a [s]tep-mother.--- She knew Mi[s]s Nel[s]on, but far from admiring her amiable qualities, [s]he had con[s]idered her as a dull, preci[s]e, infipid old maid. She had no idea that chearfulne[s]s and unaffected piety con[s]tantly inhabited the [s]ame brea[s]t, nor could [s]he conceive that rational conver[s]ation, [s]tudy, u[s]eful employment, and innocent amu[s]ement, could amply diversify the [s]cene, and be a [s]ource of tranquil happiness without the aid of public entertainments, dre[s]s, parade and folly. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] It may be ea[s]ily conceived, that two tempers [s]o diametrically oppo[s]ite would never agree. Mr. Markham had [s]een the[s]e erroneous traits in his daughter's di[s]po[s]ition, but he flattered him[s]elf, the amiable example and condescending behaviour of Mi[s]s Nel[s]on would [s]o far operate on her temper, as to make her love and endeavour to imitate her virtues. It is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe the rage and grief that di[s]played it[s]elf in the countenance of Celia, on the receipt of her father's letters, regarding only what [s]he fooli[s]hly imagined would be prejudicial to her own happine[s]s. She gave vent to her pa[s][s]ion in the mo[s]t unbecoming terms, called her father cruel, unju[s]t and unfeeling, and vowed [s]he would die [s]ooner than call Mi[s]s Nel[s]on mother. "I will go to the wedding, [s]aid [s]he, becau[s]e that woman [s]hall not have a moment's happine[s]s of which it is in my power to deprive her." With this laudable re[s]olution [s]he [s]at forward for her father's hou[s]e, where upon being tenderly embraced by him, in[s]tead of returning a cordial [s]alute, and wi[s]hing him joy, [s]he turned her face from him and bur[s]ting into tears, (which proceeded more from pa[s][s]ion than [s]en[s]ibility) [s]aid [s]he was [s]orry to find her dear mother was [s]o [s]oon forgot. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] Not forgot, my beloved; replied Mr. Markham, for I have [s]ought a woman who is her counter-part in every amiable quality. They then proceeded to church, where, after the ceremony was performed, tears and [s]ullen curtseys were all the gratulations Celia offered to her new mother. Mrs. Markham was naturally a woman of great [s]en[s]ibility, [s]he attributed Celia's melancholy to a cau[s]e that did honour to her own heart, and instead of taking offence, endeavoured to [s]oothe and entertain her during the whole day. But alas! the gentle Mrs. Markham knew not the difficulty of the ta[s]k [s]he had undertaken. She had known Celia [s]ome years before her mother's death, and always thought her an amiable, lively girl, and judging of her disposition by that of her parents, imagined there would be no difficulty in modelling her according to her own wi[s]hes. But the[s]e [s]allacious hopes were [s]oon no more. Celia from the day of her father's marriage took every opportunity in her power to thwart and vex her mother-in-law. Though Mrs. Markam was a woman of too much [s]en[s]e, to let the caprice of [s]uch a girl ruffle [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] the uncommon [s]erenity of her temper, yet was it totally impo[s][s]ible for a woman of her exquisite [s]en[s]ibility, to enjoy any tolerable degree of happine[s]s while [s]he [s]aw the darling child of the man [s]he loved and e[s]teemed of [s]o [s]roward and perver[s]e a di[s]po[s]ition. Celia was volatile, and thoughtle[s]s to exce[s]s, fond of company, and [s]o entirely unqualified to amu[s]e or entertain her[s]elf, that the mo[s]t improper [s]ociety was preferred to being alone. Her mother-in-law was of too grave and rational a turn to afford her any plea[s]ure by her conver[s]ation, and to read or work required [s]o much attention, that [s]he termed it fatigue. It was with infinite regret that Mr. Markham di[s]covered the little felicity he was like to enjoy in this [s]econd union. He [s]aw the child of his tendere[s]t affection re[s]tle[s]s and di[s]contented; he [s]aw with angui[s]h the many fruitle[s]s endeavours of Mrs. Markham to reclaim and make her pur[s]ue the direct road to happine[s]s. Whenever the tender attention of this amiable woman lead her to remon[s]trate with Celia on the impropriety of her conduct, and the mi[s]erable wa[s]te of her time, the petulant girl would bur[s]t into tears, and cry, "Oh! that my dear mother was living, I [s]hould not then be treated thus [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] cruelly, and abridged of every innocent plea[s]ure, by a woman, who having [s]tolen from me my dear father's affections, now u[s]urps an undue authority over both him and me." The[s]e continual di[s]putes greatly embittered Mrs. Markham's life.---Mr. Markham was at a lo[s]s how to conduct him[s]elf [s]o as to give pain to neither wife or daughter. In [s]hort, the whole family was unhappy from the capricious behaviour of her, who[s]e chief [s]tudy [s]hould have been to promote their felicity. Celia had her friends, her parties, and her [s]ecrets, in which Mrs. Markham was not allowed to participate; the con[s]equence was, that [s]he at a very early age had her lovers al[s]o. Among the many candidates for her favor was a Captain Par[s]low, he was a man of no fortune, ignorant, conceited, and a complete coxcomb. He [s]oon di[s]covered the weakne[s]s of Celia, he flattered her foibles, took her part again[s]t her mother-in-law, and, in [s]hort, [s]o far won on the fooli[s]h thoughtle[s]s girl, that [s]he con[s]ented to elope with him, and take a trip to Scotland. By the dropping of a letter Mrs. Markham di[s]covered the plan; [s]he talked to Celia in the accents of friend[s]hip and fond [s]olicitude, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] received in return, only impertinence and disrespect. Mrs. Markham thought it her duty to acquaint her hu[s]band with the di[s]covery [s]he had made. Grieved to the [s]oul, he [s]ent for his daughter, and in the mo[s]t pathetic terms entreated her to de[s]i[s]t from [s]o fatal a [s]tep. The artful Celia thought this was the time to alienate her father's affections from his wife---[s]he po[s]itively denied the whole charge, and declared [s]he believed it mu[s]t be a contrivance of Mrs. Markham's; begged if her dear father thought her capable of [s]uch imprudence, he would [s]end her abroad, and [s]hut her in a convent. "I know, continued [s]he, with well di[s][s]embled tears, that you have been taught to con[s]ider your poor girl as an abandoned wretch, who con[s]ulted only her own happine[s]s, but indeed, indeed my beloved father, you have been deceived. I am not the guilty creature you think me. But, alas! I have long [s]een my pre[s]ence is a bar to your happiness, [s]end me from you, then, dear Sir; [s]ince it is impo[s][s]ible we can both enjoy content, let me be the victim, and may your felicity be unbounded." This artful [s]peech had the de[s]ired effect, and Mr. Markham believing his daughter perfectly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] innocent, began to treat the woman with coolne[s]s whom he imagined had attempted to create dissention between him and his only child. Celia [s]aw [s]he had now completely made her mother-in-law unhappy, and exulted in her cruelty, adding in[s]ult to the already poignant sufferings of the patient and amiable Mrs. Markham. But Celia had not [s]ufficient art to elude or evade the [s]olicitude of her admirer. Par[s]low [s]till continued his devoirs, and Mi[s]s Markham li[s]tened to his [s]lattery and received his a[s][s]iduities with too much plea[s]ure to give any room for de[s]pair; in a [s]hort time [s]he eloped. Her father was amazed, and how much was his a[s]toni[s]hment increa[s]ed when the following letter was put into his hand. DEAR AND HONORED SIR, Though the [s]tep I have taken will, I am certain, by the generality of mankind, be called an improper one, my own heart acquits me of any motive but a wi[s]h to in[s]ure your happiness. I have long [s]een, with [s]incere angui[s]h of heart, how much my pre[s]ence militated again[s]t your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] tranquillity. I am convinced, my dear father, Mrs. Markham is now the only obje[s]ct of your affection; your once tenderly beloved child has only a [s]econdary place in your heart. Pardon me, my revered parent, if I [s]ay, this was too evident not to be di[s]covered, and when once di[s]covered, too painful to be borne in [s]ilence. The contempt which Mrs. Markham's unju[s]t [s]u[s]picions [s]ubject me to, not only from our acquaintance, but even our [s]ervants, has urged me to make choice of a protector for my [s]ame and honor, nor do I [s]cruple to add, a protector from her unde[s]erved malice and continual ill-nature. Adieu, my dear father, may you be as happy as I wi[s]h you; forgive and think with compa[s][s]ion on your child, CELIA MARKHAM. The feelings of a father on the receipt of [s]uch a letter are more ea[s]ily conceived than de[s]cribed. He had long con[s]idered his innocent wife as a per[s]on who had di[s]turbed the peace of his family, and now that he imagined him[s]elf convinced of her unju[s]t conduct towards his daughter, his displeasure knew no bounds; rage, invective, and bitter reproach, were all the gentle, meek, uncomplaining [s]ufferer, received from a hu[s]band [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] who once fondly e[s]teemed her. But though Mrs. Markham complained not, the di[s]tre[s]s of her mind preyed upon her delicate frame, [s]he [s]unk under this unexpected misfortune, and a rapid decline in a few months put a period to her existence. In the mean time Celia and her hu[s]band had been received and forgiven by Mr. Markham; but, alas! that too indulgent father [s]oon discovered, that in the lo[s]s of his wife, he had been bereft of every earthly comfort; his daughter rather triumphed in, than endeavoured to [s]oothe his melancholy---[s]he threw out the mo[s]t illiberal cen[s]ures on the memory of the decea[s]ed Mrs. Markham, and having no longer any particular end to attain by pretending violent affection to her father, [s]he at fir[s]t began to [s]light and at length totally neglected him. He felt, acutely felt, her unkindne[s]s, but [s]till his affection led him to lavi[s]h immen[s]e [s]ums to [s]upport the extravagance of her[s]elf and hu[s]band, till unable any longer to keep them from ruin, he gave up all but about one hundred pounds a year, with which he retired into the country, and ended his days in what he called peaceful ob[s]curity . And to the la[s]t his prayers were offered at the throne of grace for his ungrateful child---but alas! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] Celia, by her own conduct counteracted the effects of tho[s]e pious prayers. Neglected, nay de[s]pi[s]ed, by her hu[s]band, [s]he launched into every [s]pecies of di[s][s]ipation, and was in a few years reduced to a [s]tate of ab[s]olute penury, where remor[s]e is not the lea[s]t painful of her many heavy afflictions, all which [s]he has brought on her[s]elf by an illiberal ob[s]tinate conduct; for had [s]he rightly con[s]idered the virtues and amiable deportment of Mrs. Markham, [s]he might have contributed to the [s]elicity of her father, and, in the end, ultimately in[s]ured her own. How different was the behaviour of Screna--- But as my letter is already of a con[s]iderable length, I [s]hall re[s]erve her [s]tory 'till the next po[s]t. Adieu, my beloved pupils, once more believe me, to be completely happy your[s]elves, you mu[s]t [s]tudy the happine[s]s of all with whom you are connected; for there is more real plea[s]ure flows from the reflection of having promoted the welfare and tranquillity of a fellow creature, than can proceed from the highe[s]t [s]elf gratifications the world can afford. The one is like a tran[s]ient vapour that for a moment illumines the [s]ky, pa[s][s]es and is forgotten; but the other, like the glorious [s]un, glads the whole face of nature, by its enlivening beams through the day, and even lends its rays to the [s]ilver moon, to chear the horrors of approaching [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] night. So does the remembrance of good actions gild the day of life, and chear the heavy night of approaching death. God ble[s]s you, my dear girls, believe my friend[s]hip [s]incere and unchangeable, while life's warm fluid animates the heart of MENTORIA. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.

Mr. O[s]borne was left a widower at a very early age, with only one daughter, named Serena, who, when [s]he had the misfortune to lo[s]e her mother, was [s]carcely three years old. She inherited by the death of her mother, a genteel independence, and was reputed heire[s]s to her father's fortune, which was not incon[s]iderable. Not long after this melancholy event Mr. O[s]bore, being on a vi[s]it to a friend in the country, became acquainted with Mi[s]s Withers.

She was the daughter of a man who enjoyed in a country town, a considerable and lucrative po[s]t under government; his wife had brought him four or five thou[s]and pounds, which had been accumulated by her father, who regarded not the cries of the fatherle[s]s, or the tears of the widow. This woman's education had been [s]uch as might be expected for the child of a poor petty-fogging lawyer, who by dint of chicanery and dirty employment, was [s]craping a little [s]ordid dro[s]s together, and thought by leaving her a fortune, he left her every nece[s][s]ary recommendation to [s]ecure her advancement in life; the con[s]equence was, that to the mo[s]t illiberal contracted ideas and consummate ignorance, [s]he added the pride and [s]elf conceit of a fir[s]t-rate woman of fa[s]hion; [s]he was extravagantly fond of dre[s]s, parade, and [s]how; but had no idea of any difference being nece[s][s]ary between the education of a gentlewoman, and that of a trade[s]man's or farmer's daughter. Brought up under [s]uch a mother, with [s]uch con[s]ined notions, Mi[s]s Withers had been taught to believe that the good hou[s]ewife and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] accomplished woman, were one and the [s]ame thing. She perfectly under[s]tood the art of cookery, pickling, pre[s]erving, and all the long &c's. nece[s][s]ary to form a complete hou[s]e-keeper. She could work tent-[s]titch, tambour, and crossstitch, make all her father's, and indeed, all the family linen, knew the cheape[s]t ways of going to market, how to [s]cold and keep her [s]ervants in order; in [s]hort, had been brought up as a complete Mrs. Notable . But to the fine arts [s]he was a perfect [s]tranger. Mu[s]ic, dancing, or drawing, had no charms for her, nor had [s]he the lea[s]t idea of the plea[s]ures re[s]ulting from a well informed, elegantly cultivated mind. Haughty, yet mean; ignorant, yet ob[s]tinate in her opinion, however ab[s]urd, and deaf to the voice of conviction. She had been educated in the [s]tricte[s]t principles of methodi[s]m, yet was [s]he of no fixed religion, having been wearied in her youth by being too rigidly obliged to conform to her parents manners; [s]he contracted a di[s]like to her religious duties, and at the time Mr. O[s]borne fir[s]t [s]aw her, was of no particular fect whatever. She had, by the death of her mother, who had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] been extremely anxious to make her dear Jemima a fortune, ju[s]t come to the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of ten thousand pounds, and was [s]o in[s]inuatiug in her manner, that [s]he was univer[s]ally well received in all companies, and called one of the be[s]t kind of girls in the world. Mr. O[s]borne was captivated with her lovely per[s]on and [s]pecious manners, and having made propo[s]als to her guardians, was accepted, and the lady, in due time, became Mrs. O[s]borne. She had from the fir[s]t of her acquaintance pretended a violent attachment to the little Serena, I [s]ay pretended, becau[s]e I have been [s]ince convinced [s]he regarded her with an eye of envy and ill-nature from the moment [s]he became her mother-in-law. In about twelve months Mrs. O[s]borne presented her hu[s]band with a little girl, and [s]olemnly declared, at the time of her birth, it was impossible for her to love any child better than [s]he did Serena; and that it [s]hould be her chief [s]tudy to make no difference between the children. This was a declaration I, who was pre[s]ent, was by no means plea[s]ed with, as I knew it was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] not in nature for a woman to love another child [s]o well as her own offspring---and though a [s]trong [s]en[s]e of duty, and a naturally compassionate heart, might lead a woman to treat with the utmo[s]t tenderne[s]s, a girl, deprived of her natural parent, and thrown, as it were, on her protection; yet it was impo[s][s]ible but inclination mu[s]t lead her to give the preference to her own child. As Serena and Jemima (the name of her little half-[s]i[s]ter) grew up, light and [s]hade could not be more oppo[s]ite than their di[s]po[s]itions. Serena was [s]en[s]ible, volatile, and chearful, of a bright genius, fond of the pur[s]uit of knowledge, yet meek, mild and innocent as it was po[s][s]ible for a human being to be. Jemima was [s]ullen, proud, ob[s]tinate, and [s]o [s]tupid, that it was not in the power of any ma[s]ters whatever to cultivate a mind rendered impenctrable by nature. The excellencies which di[s]covered them[s]elves in the mind and di[s]po[s]ition of Serena were [s]o many faults in the eyes of Mrs. O[s]borne, nor did [s]he fail to aggravate every error to which her volatility, or thoughtle[s]s innocence might betray her, into crimes, [s]o that by degrees her father's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] affection became alienated from her, and it was almo[s]t impo[s][s]ible for the poor girl to [s]peak, move, or look [s]o as not to give offence. As [s]he advanced towards womanhood, her troubles increa[s]ed---her high [s]en[s]e of her religious duties was termed hypocrisy--- her [s]trong [s]en[s]ibility, art; and her fine ta[s]te, and brilliant genius, follies, which would in the end lead her to ruin. When [s]he had attained the age of [s]ixteen, the beque[s]t of a large fortune obliged her father to vi[s]it Jamaica; he re[s]olved to take his family with him, and had not been there long before Mrs. O[s]borne was [s]eized with one of tho[s]e fevers incident to the climate. Tenderly and with the utmo[s]t care did Serena watch over her for many months when the disorder had left her in a weak emaciated [s]tate, did [s]he never quit her bed-[s]ide, admini[s]tering every medicine, nor ever taking re[s]t except what [s]he procured at intervals on a matra[s]s in the [s]ame apartment. And what was the return [s]he received? Petti[s]hne[s]s, di[s]content, and repining. Frequently did Mrs. O[s]borne a[s]k, if [s]he was brought to that [s]trange place to be murdered---if it was intended [s]he [s]hould be poi[s]oned---and whether Serena did not know that the doctor de[s]igned to kill her; and the[s]e expre[s][s]ions were not the effect of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] delirium, but [s]poken with a coolne[s]s and a[s]perity that tore the heart of the mild affectionate girl to whom they were addre[s][s]ed. Mrs. O[s]borne at length recovered, when it plea[s]ed heaven to take her hu[s]band from her, and [s]he was left involved in a di[s]agreeable law [s]uit, which was finally terminated to her di[s]advantage, [s]he was ca[s]t with co[s]ts of [s]uit, and returned to England with little more than five hundred pounds remaining. Now it was that Serena [s]hewed her[s]elf to be the amiable girl I had ever thought her. When [s]he received her fortune, [s]he [s]ettled an hand[s]ome annuity on Mrs. O[s]borne, and divided the re[s]idue between Jemima and her[s]elf; though at her father's death [s]he had been, by their arts, deprived of any advantage from his fortune, the whole being by will left to Mrs. O[s]borne and her daughter, but providence had ordained that they were not to enjoy it. To the la[s]t hour that [s]he remained with her mother-in-law, [s]he [s]tudied her happine[s]s only, enough I have been informed it was [s]eldom in that [s]he received even the [s]malle[s]t token of approbation. Her [s]ociety was circum[s]cribed, her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] amu[s]ements abridged, her mo[s]t innocent actions cen[s]ured, and the gaiety of her heart con[s]trued into levity, and reprimanded as vice; nay, after the alteration in their circum[s]tances, [s]he was suffered to perform the mo[s]t menial offices: in [s]hort, my dear girls, her education had been confined, her genius cramped, and had [s]he not been a girl of an uncommon good heart, her di[s]po[s]ition mu[s]t have been totally perverted by the con[s]tant restraint [s]he lived under, and the [s]everity with which [s]he was treated; while Jemima was indulged in idlene[s]s, her faults glo[s][s]ed over, and her perver[s]e haughty di[s]po[s]ition called laudable pride. Yet did I never hear that Serena ever u[s]ed an unbecoming expre[s][s]ion to her mother, or made any complaint of unkindne[s]s. She has been now for [s]ome years married to a de[s]erving man, and [s]till continues to treat Mrs. O[s]borne with the highe[s]t re[s]pect, and her daughter with affection, though the ingratitude of Jemima often appears, by her unkind neglect of a [s]i[s]ter who [s]acrificed her own intere[s]t to the unterest and happine[s]s of her mother. Serena, though happy in her matrimonial nection, is not in affluent circum[s]tances. Jemima is lately married to a man of large tune, and removed to a di[s]tant part of England, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] where [s]he can [s]eldom find time to write to her [s]i[s]ter, and when [s]he does [s]o far conde[s]cend, it is with [s]uch apparent carele[s][s]ne[s]s, coldne[s]s, and di[s]tance, that the warm heart of Serena is chilled by the peru[s]al of her letters; yet will I venture to affirm Serena the happier woman of the two. I happened to mention one day the unmerited treatment [s]he had received, not only from them, but from her other relations; and mark, my dear girls, the an[s]wer I received. "Were I to [s]ay their unkindne[s]s did not give me pain, I [s]hould be guilty of fal[s]ehood, becau[s]e I have that warm affection in my heart, which expands it with brotherly love towards all my fellow creatures, and never yet breathed a wi[s]h to the di[s]advantage of a [s]ingle individual. I mourn their afflictions, and rejoice in their pro[s]perity. I am therefore, con[s]cious of not de[s]erving their unkindne[s]s, and wrapt in the integrity of my own heart, from my [s]oul pity the bo[s]om that can harbour malice or ill will towards any one." Thus, my dear Mi[s]s Winworths, you [s]ee how much our own happine[s]s depends on our strenuously cultivating [s]uch philanthropy of temper as may lead us to regard our[s]elves but as [s]econdary [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] objects; the felicity we promote for others will return with double force to our own bo[s]oms, and con[s]cious of having always regarded our fellow creatures as our[s]elves, we can look up with confidence to that good providence who will never for[s]ake the children of obedience. Adieu! Your friend in [s]incerity, MENTORIA. N. B. Soon after this la[s]t letter Lord Winworth was married to Mrs. Clairville, and the young ladies conducting them[s]elves according to the advice of their amiable friend, Mentoria, found in the new-made Lady Winworth, every engaging quality that could be de[s]ired, to form the polite agreeable companion, the affectionate parent, and [s]incere friend. The corre[s]pondence between Mentoria and her pupils was continued for many years, but as the publication of the whole would render this work too exten[s]ive, be[s]ides occa[s]ion unnecessary repetitions, I have [s]elected only two more letters, with which I [s]hall clo[s]e the pre[s]ent collection; one addre[s][s]ed to Mi[s]s Gertrude, on her marriage, and a [s]econd to the [s]ame lady, on the birth of a daughter, written by her venerable friend, when [s]he was in the la[s]t [s]tage of a decline, and ha[s]tily verging towards her place of re[s]t, to which [s]he humbly looked forward with that [s]weet confidence and heavenly hope which ever elevates the [s]oul of a departing Chri[s]tian. MENTORIA TO MISS G. WINWORTH. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] I address my[s]elf [s]ingly to you, my dear Gertrude, becau[s]e the delicacy of your present [s]ituation demands my [s]erious attention, and calls up all my tenderne[s]s. I am inexpre[s][s]ibly plea[s]ed to find you have made choice of [s]o worthy a man as Sir Arthur Fitzgerald, and that your father approves the object of your [s]election. I think you have acted like a woman of [s]en[s]e and prudence, and I make no doubt but you will pre[s]erve the [s]ame propriety of conduct when a wife, as has evidently characteri[s]ed you while [s]ingle. I admire that real delicacy which impelled you to give an immediate di[s]mi[s][s]ion to all tho[s]e pretenders who [s]olicited your hand without being able to influence your heart in their favor. There [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] cannot be a more de[s]picable pa[s][s]ion than that insatiable thir[s]t for admiration, which leads a woman to encourage indi[s]criminately the forward advances of every coxcomb, who [s]hall pay them the incen[s]e of flattery, and be continually spreading their lures to attract adulation, however in their hearts they may de[s]pi[s]e the per[s]on who offers it. I am [s]en[s]ible, my dear Gertrude will pardon me, if anxious for her future happine[s]s, I venture to give her my advice and opinion for the preservation of her felicity in the married [s]tate; it has often been remarked, that a heart is much ea[s]ier gained than kept, and, believe me, it is a very judicious ob[s]ervation. There requires more care, attention, and solicitude, from the wife to the hu[s]band, than from the mi[s]tre[s]s to her adoring lover. The lover being but [s]eldom with you, [s]ees you only in part, it is natural to [s]uppo[s]e you would neither appear before him in a [s]latternly dre[s]s, or with a peevi[s]h a[s]pect. Your clothes will be always put on with neatne[s]s, and your face dre[s][s]ed in [s]miles. On the contrary, the hu[s]band being always in your company, has an opportunity of di[s]covering every little defect or blemi[s]h in your per[s]on, manners, or di[s]po[s]ition, and the chief [s]tudy of a wife [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] be to guard again[s]t every thing that might create di[s]ta[s]te, or excite di[s]gu[s]t. And in the fir[s]t place let me recommend a mo[s]t [s]crupulous regard to delicacy and neatne[s]s. Many young women fooli[s]hly imagine, as [s]oon as they are married, they have a right to understand and laugh at an indelicate allu[s]ion, but from this fault, the native purity of your mind will, I am certain, pre[s]erve you, [s]ince nothing but extreme ignorance or levity could lead any woman to li[s]ten with apparent plea[s]ure, to an improper tale, or ill timed je[s]t. There are too many men, nay, even among tho[s]e who call them[s]elves gentlemen, who will not [s]cruple to [s]hock a woman's ears with conversation of this kind; but the look of marked disapprobation and [s]ilent contempt, will never fail to [s]ilence them, unle[s]s they are either brutes or fools, and to [s]uch there is no fear of your being expo[s]ed. The next thing is neatne[s]s in your per[s]on and dre[s]s and an equanimity of temper to be preserved towards your hu[s]band, and your [s]ervants;--- nothing degrades a gentlewoman more than her [s]uffering her temper to be [s]o far ruffled as to u[s]e improper language to her dependants, nor can [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] any thing be more di[s]gu[s]ting to a man of [s]en[s]e than to [s]ee his wife give way to [s]udden [s]tarts of pa[s][s]ion. To every relation and friend of your hu[s]band, [s]hew a polite attention and marked preference; [s]hew him, that to be related to, or e[s]teemed by him, is a [s]ufficient claim upon your regard--- whatever be his errors, confine the knowledge of them to your own bo[s]om, and endeavour, by the milde[s]t per[s]ua[s]ions, to lead him to the path of rectitude. Di[s]cretion mu[s]t direct you as to the proper [s]ea[s]on to offer your advice and opinions, [s]ince men in general are [s]o tenacious of their prerogative, that they [s]tart from every thing that has the lea[s]t appearance of controul or opposition. Never attempt to re[s]train his plea[s]ures; if he [s]hould be [s]ond of company, di[s][s]ipation and expen[s]ive amu[s]ements, be it your [s]tudy to detach his mind from tho[s]e pur[s]uits, by endeavouring to render his home delightful, let your face be ever arrayed in [s]miles at his approach, form a society of tho[s]e he loves and e[s]teems mo[s]t, exert your various abilities to charm and entertain him, and believe me, he who con[s]tantly meets chearfulness and [s]miles at home, will [s]eldom wi[s]h to [s]eek abroad for plea[s]ure. Above all things never [s]uffer any per[s]on to [s]peak di[s]re[s]pectfully of him in your pre[s]ence, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] guard your heart from the lea[s]t approach of jealousy; [s]hould there even be occa[s]ion for suspicion, be careful not to let him [s]ee you have discovered his di[s]honorable conduct, and never suffer any one, more e[s]pecially a man , to hear you complain. Avoid reproaches, they in general increa[s]e rather than alleviate the di[s]tre[s]s; if patient suffering and the mild remon[s]trance of an afflicted uncomplaining [s]pirit, will not work a reformation, reproach and di[s]content will have no effect. You mu[s]t not be above attending to his intere[s]t [s]o far as may lead you to in[s]pect the expences of your family; have [s]tated and regular times for examining your hou[s]e-keeper's accounts, and being [s]atisfied that your trades-people are regularly paid; and do not let trifles put you a[s]ide from this very nece[s][s]ary point. Let your own expences be regulated by prudence void of par[s]imony, and [s]uffer not a pa[s][s]ion for finery, and a wi[s]h to eclip[s]e your acquaintance, prompt you to over[s]tep your income, or deprive you of the inexpre[s][s]ible plea[s]ure of relieving indigent merit. Though I would not have you [s]acrifice too largely at the [s]hrine of that idol, fa[s]hion, I would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] have you follow her [s]o far as may make your appearance alway de[s]erve the appellation of elegantly neat; nor mu[s]t you confine this appearance only to your going abroad or receiving company at home; though you were to be in the country for months, and [s]ee none but your husband and [s]ervants, never neglect the real necessary duties of the toilet, it is a re[s]pect due to him, it [s]hews a wi[s]h to appear agreeable in his eyes, and that you prefer his approbation to that of all the world be[s]ide. There is one more circum[s]tance I mu[s]t mention, although a thorough knowledge of your disposition renders it almo[s]t unnece[s][s]ary; yet I have [s]een [s]o many couples made inexpre[s][s]ibly miserable by it, that I cannot re[s]i[s]t my inclination to warn you of [s]o dangerous a conduct. Never permit any man, however clothed with the ma[s]k of friend[s]hip, to treat you with familiarity. There are many freedoms, which to a girl may be perfectly innocent, and yet become almo[s]t crimes when offered to, or received by a married woman. A married woman [s]hould never [s]uffer a man to entertain her in a [s]train of gallantry, a pre[s][s]ure of the hand is an affront, and an attempt at a salute (except where the nearne[s]s of the relation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] authori[s]es [s]uch a liberty) is, and [s]hould be re[s]ented as an in[s]ult. There is a decent gravity of manner that will at once excite admiration and re[s]pect, and yet exclude all improper familiarity, nor can any thing be more ridiculous, than to [s]ee the mi[s]tre[s]s of a family, perhaps the mother of four or five children, affecting a giddy flirting carriage, that would be hardly excu[s]able in a girl of [s]ixteen---it may, in [s]ome in[s]tances, proceed from an innocent gaiety of heart, but it hardly ever fails of degenerating into levity and imprudence, always lays a woman open to in[s]ult, of which [s]he cannot complain, becau[s]e [s]he evidently invited it; and too often ends in the total lo[s]s of honor, happine[s]s, and reputation. Be chearful, conde[s]cending, and polite to all, but let there ever be that dignity in your manner which may keep impertinent fools , or designing villains  at a proper di[s]tance. Pardon the length of this epi[s]tle, and believe it proceeds from a friend who loves you. Remember me affectionately to your dear [s]i[s]ters.--- Adieu, may every ble[s][s]ing be your portion here and hereafter. MENTORIA. MENTORIA TO LADY FITZGERALD. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] The news that you were [s]afe in bed, and mother to a daughter, my dear Gertrude, will, believe me, give as much [s]atisfaction to my heart, as any [s]ublunary plea[s]ure po[s][s]ibly can; and, weak as I am, tottering as it were on the very brink of a va[s]t eternity, I cannot re[s]i[s]t the de[s]ire I feel, of once more writing to my beloved pupils, for in addre[s][s]ing Lady Fitzgerald, I [s]uppo[s]e myself al[s]o writing to her [s]i[s]ters. But fir[s]t a few words to your[s]elf, in regard to this dear, this precious little charge, with which it has plea[s]ed heaven to entru[s]t you. May it ever be impre[s][s]ed on your mind that the future happiness or mi[s]ery of this child depends greatly on the treatment [s]he receives during her puerile years. Let not a too great fondne[s]s prompt you, by extreme indulgence, to enervate the faculties of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] her [s]oul, or pervert her di[s]po[s]ition, and by [s]o doing render her totally unfit to bear the many inconveniences and cro[s][s]es [s]he mu[s]t nece[s][s]arily meet with in her pa[s][s]age through life. And on the contrary, do not, by an ill-judged [s]everity, drive her to mean [s]ubterfuges, fal[s]hoods and deceit, through fear of your anger.---Many an amiable girl has been totally ruined by [s]uch treatment; it leads them to fear but not love their parents, it prompts them to make companions of their [s]ervants, and often ends in the entire perversion of their principles. Teach her to fear to di[s]oblige you, but let it be through fear of lo[s]ing your affection, not from the apprehen[s]ion of puni[s]hment. Do not be too anxious to have your child prai[s]ed for an early progre[s]s in her education; a young mind [s]hould not be loaded, it [s]poils the memory, and often occa[s]ions a di[s]like to [s]tudy in more advanced life; be[s]ides, children accu[s]tomed to hear them[s]elves commended are apt to think them[s]elves sufficiently wi[s]e and accompli[s]hed before their education is well begun. Do not encourage her in a love of finery, or [s]uffer her to be told [s]he is hand[s]ome, they both be very pernicious to her future tranquillity. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] There is one thing which parents are very apt, not only to do them[s]elves, but to [s]uffer their servants to do the [s]ame; that is, when any little ma[s]ter vi[s]its at the hou[s]e nearly of mi[s]s's age, [s]he is told that he is her little hu[s]band, and that [s]he mu[s]t hold up her head and behave like a woman, or [s]he will never be married. Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced into ther little hearts, before they are capable of under[s]tanding what the word means.

Teach them the difference between right and wrong, and convince their reason, by pointing out the real way to promote their own happine[s]s, and merit the regard and e[s]teem of their friends. Do not introduce your girl too early into public, it will give her a ta[s]te for di[s][s]ipation: in proper time let her partake in moderation of all the amu[s]ements of the metropolis, [s]o as to prevent the bad effects of curio[s]ity ungratified; but at the [s]ame time accu[s]tom her to find re[s]ources within her[s]elf, that may, at all times, enable her to bani[s]h that mon[s]ter Ennui .

I am certain there would not be half the imprudencies committed by girls in general, if they were not kept at [s]uch an awful di[s]tance by their mothers; that fearing either ridicule or reproof, they dare not entru[s]t them with their little plans and di[s]appointments, and relying either on the advice of [s]ome one as inexperienced as them[s]elves, or to the [s]ugge[s]tions of their own [s]imple hearts, they involve them[s]elves in troubles, which endanger their peace of mind and ruin their reputation, but [s]o it will ever be while mothers forget they have ever been girls them[s]elves, and make no allowance for the volatility of youth, and the innocent impul[s]es of a heart unburthened by the cares of the world.

It is example, my dear friend, mu[s]t teach her the true principles of the Chri[s]tian Religion; let her [s]ee you in the act of devotion, let her curiosity be awakened, and then, as you an[s]wer her que[s]tions lead her by degrees to love, wor[s]hip and adore the Almighty giver of all good; convince her of her dependence on his bounty for food, raiment, and all the ble[s][s]ings of life; teach her to place her whole confidence in his mercy, to receive even the [s]malle[s]t ble[s][s]ing with gratitude, and to bow under the heavie[s]t affliction with patience and humility. But above all things, mind that your example does not contradict you precept. What confidence can a child place in the religion of its parent, when the parent lives in direct oppo[s]ition to the principles of that religion. Oh! my dear friend, this is the one thing needful! this the heavenly comforter, that supports us through life, and will cheer us in the hour of death!

There was a time, when, if the daughter of a reputable trade[s]man could read and write good Engli[s]h, handle her needle with neatne[s]s and celerity, and under[s]tand both the theory and practice of good hou[s]ewi[s]ery, [s]he was thought perfectly accompli[s]hed, and [s]o indeed [s]he was as tho[s]e qalifications rendered her capable of undertaking the management of a family. But in the pre[s]ent refined age, if an indu[s]trious trade[s]man can afford to give his daughter, five hundred pounds, it is immediately [s]ettled by Mamma, that Mi[s]s mu[s]t be genteelly educated. Accordingly [s]he is at an early age [s]ent to a boarding-school, where [s]he learns to jabber bad French, and wor[s]e Engli[s]h; the old-fa[s]hion sampler, and u[s]eful plain-work are neglected, and [s]he is in[s]tructed how to work fillagree, make [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] wafer work, daub [s]attin, and work ill proportioned figures in cloth, which in due time are curiou[s]ly mounted, and hung round to ornament the parlour of the fond but ill judging parents. Add to the[s]e accompli[s]hments the very fashionable one of jingling the keys of the harp[s]ichord, with great velocity, though perhaps out of time and out of tune. Imagine Mi[s]s ju[s]t returned, at the age of seventeen, her mind puffed up with vanity, and her head well [s]tored with [s]en[s]ibility, and all the delicate feelings to be gleaned from a circulating library, the contents of which the has eagerly and indi[s]criminately peru[s]ed, without any one taking the pains to direct her judgment or correct her ta[s]te. We will [s]uppo[s]e her lovely in her per[s]on, and attractive in her manners, [s]he comes home, and is idolized by her too partial mother, and [s]poken of by her father with pride and exultation; but alas! [s]he is too fine a lady to pay any attention to the dome[s]tic concerns of the family. In this fooli[s]h idea [s]he is indulged by the mother, who thinks her dear girl's beauty, sensibility, and accompli[s]hments, will undoubtedly obtain her a match far [s]uperior to her pre[s]ent [s]tation, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] and [s]he will have no occa[s]ion to be a good housewife. But the[s]e [s]anguine wi[s]hes are [s]eldom if ever realized, and we will [s]uppo[s]e her married to a man who is ju[s]t entered into a genteel and improving line of bu[s]ine[s]s; her friends think it a good match, her fortune is an acqui[s]ition to her hu[s]band and they enter the career of life with all the hopes of permanent happine[s]s which peace and plenty can in[s]pire. But what a wretched figure does this elegant accompli[s]hed girl make, as mi[s]tre[s]s of a family; her [s]ervants cheat and laugh at her, her acquaintance blame her, and perhaps [s]he may incur even the cen[s]ure of her hu[s]band, for paying no more attention to matters which [s]o nearly concern his intere[s]t. Has [s]he children, [s]he knows not how to make or mend their clothes, [s]he is always [s]urrounded with difficulties, from which [s]he knows not how to extricate her[s]elf, and a[s]hamed to confe[s]s her ignorance to any one who could in[s]truct her in the point [s]he requires, [s]he becomes peevi[s]h and dissatisfied, neglects even tho[s]e accompli[s]hments which [s]he formerly [s]trove [s]o hard to attain; becomes negligent in her dre[s]s, carele[s]s in her manners, and [s]inks into a very blank in the creation.

Nor can the whole univer[s]e pre[s]ent us with an object more truly de[s]erving our pity, than [s]uch a woman in a [s]tate of penury! She is at a lo[s]s how to perform even the nece[s][s]ary duties of life, [s]he cannot exert her[s]elf to obtain even a [s]ingle meal for her[s]elf or children; [s]he pines in obscurity, regretting her u[s]ele[s]s education, and wishes that the [s]ums [s]o expended, had been laid by to encrea[s]e her fortune, and [s]he her[s]elf had been only in[s]tructed in tho[s]e things, which would have tended ultimately to render her a u[s]eful and respectable member of [s]ociety. But how widely different is the lot of the happy girl, who[s]e parents have, not only by precept but example, implanted in her mind the great nece[s][s]ity of rendering her[s]elf u[s]eful, before the can be e[s]teemed valuable--who perfectly understands how to manage her family, and regulate her [s]ervants -- who to affability and chearfulness, adds indu[s]try oeconomy and piety.

She is not a[s]hamed to inve[s]tigate even the minute[s]t concerns of her family; her expences are regulated by the [s]tricte[s]t rules of frugality void of par[s]imony, with one hand [s]he [s]ecures her hu[s]band's intere[s]t, and with the other di[s]pen[s]es to the [s]ons and daughters of poverty, the overplus of tho[s]e ble[s][s]ings which her own prudence has helped to [s]ecure to her[s]elf. She is always [s]trictly neat in her apparel, but entirely free from [s]hew or finery; her whole family is regular, uniform and decent, her servants re[s]pect her, her hu[s]band idolizes her, and her children look up to her as their friend and benefactre[s]s, from who[s]e bright example they may learn the road to happine[s]s. Should even misfortune overtake her, [s]he is [s]till chearful, [s]till unembarra[s][s]ed, without a murmur [s]he conde[s]cends to perform even the meane[s]t offices for her[s]elf, her hu[s]band, and children; [s]he exerts her utmo[s]t abilities to retrieve the pro[s]perity they had unfortunately lo[s]t, [s]he [s]hares her husband's care, and alleviates his concern -- and [s]hould their hone[s]t efforts to regain their former [s]tate of affluence fail, [s]he [s]ets down perfectly happy in the reflection that [s]he had di[s]charged, to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] the utmo[s]t of her power, the duties of that [s]tation, in which it plea[s]ed Heaven to place her. Yet, think not I mean entirely to [s]et a[s]ide tho[s]e accompli[s]hments, which when kept under proper regulations, certainly tend to make the female character more irre[s]i[s]tibly charming. There are a certain cla[s]s of women to whom the[s]e accompli[s]hments are ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary, to their filling their re[s]pective characters with propriety. A woman of independent fortune may with [s]afety indulge her ta[s]te for mu[s]ic, drawing, &c. but, in the name of common [s]en[s]e, what has a girl to do with the fine arts, who, perhaps, after [s]he leaves [s]chool, has neither time or opportunity to pur[s]ue tho[s]e [s]tudies, unle[s]s by [s]o doing, [s]he neglects [s]ome more u[s]eful employment. I acknowledge that it is not impo[s][s]ible for the u[s]eful and ornamental branches of education to be combined; nay, that it is even natural for a woman of [s]en[s]e and di[s]cretion to endeavour to blend them in [s]uch a manner, as to render them only as foils to each other, and the woman who [s]tudies to unite in her[s]elf, the attentive hou[s]ewife, the good mother, affectionate wife, well-informed companion, and accompli[s]hed woman, is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] certainly a character de[s]erving e[s]teem and veneration, we look upon her almo[s]t as a being of a [s]uperior order, and [s]he is at once beloved, admired and re[s]pected by both [s]exes. As [s]o much of the happine[s]s of mankind depends on the females connected in their families, I have expatiated on the nece[s][s]ity of young women being brought up in the practice of every dome[s]tic virtue, more largely than I at fir[s]t intended, [s]ince not only the ri[s]ing generation, but ages yet unborn [s]hall venerate or execrate our memories, according to the advice and example we give our children. If the daughters of the pre[s]ent age are [s]uffered to remain totally ignorant of the dome[s]tic regulations nece[s][s]ary to be ob[s]erved in every family, what are we to expect in the next generation, but that the ruin which has already begun to [s]hew it[s]elf in our mo[s]t capital cities, will [s]pread it[s]elf all over the kingdom, and [s]ink it at la[s]t in one univer[s]al [s]tate of bankruptcy. More, much more than we [s]hould at fir[s]t be led to imagine, depends on the education of the female world. What ruin, what inevitable desolation may not an idle di[s][s]ipated woman bring on tho[s]e who may unfortunately be attached to her per[s]on.

Were every parent of my opinion they would fir[s]t, by example, plant the [s]eeds of genuine worth in the brea[s]t of their daughters, and by the tendere[s]t care and milde[s]t precept, cultivate each budding virtue, 'till they blo[s][s]omed in full perfection, then ornamenting them with the elegant accompli[s]hments nece[s][s]ary to complete the female character, render them at once the pride and glory of their country.

He had but one child, and having been early deprived of his wife, he lavi[s]hed his whole [s]tock of tenderne[s]s on Fatima. Though fortune had not been lavi[s]h of her gifts to the father ofFatima, yet he wanted not the necessaries or comforts of life--his cottage was clean, and furni[s]hed with every thing u[s]eful; his fields [s]upplied them with food; his flock with raiment. Fatima was coar[s]e in her per[s]on, but [s]he was chearfull and good-natured--[s]he ro[s]e each morn with the [s]eathered [s]ong[s]ters, and chearfully performed the duties of her [s]tation; her whole [s]tudy was to plea[s]e her father, and a [s]mile from Zegdad was at any time, ample recompence for the [s]evere[s]t [s]atigue, and like a cordial [s]erved to revive her drooping [s]pirits. She would a[s][s]i[s]t, una[s]ked, in the mo[s]t laborious employments, and when the labour of the day was pa[s]t, [s]he would lightly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] trip over the green turf, with her young companions, while her father played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was calm as the delights of Paradise. One day her father [s]ent her to the grand Vizier's, with fruit for his favorite--[s]he was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira was repo[s]ing on a bed of ro[s]es, clad in all the pomp of ea[s]tern magnificence, while two [s]laves were fanning her to re[s]t. Fatima had never before [s]een aught but simplicity--she was filled with wonder and a[s]toni[s]hment at the [s]urpri[s]ing beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as [s]he gazed, envy and di[s]content crept into her hitherto guilele[s]s heart. She returned home with a mind totally altered to what it was. Her rural pa[s]times no more deligted her--labour was now a trouble -- [s]he had been awitne[s]s to the ca[s]e and indolence of Semira. If at any time [s]he caught a glimp[s]e of her per[s]on in the [s]tream, [s]he turned from it with di[s]gu[s]t. Her days were joyle[s]s, and her nights [s]pent in bewailing her unhappy lot. One evening, deaf to the [s]olicitations of her young companions, [s]he retired to a thick grove, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] and inattentive to the [s]ound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to her [s]orrow. Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know [s]o hard a fate--to eat the bread of labour, to [s]leep upon a ru[s]hy couch, while Semira is [s]urrounded with [s]plendor, is [s]erved by kneeling [s]laves, and [s]leeps on a bed of down! Why has nature denied me tho[s]e ravi[s]hing beauties, it has [s]o bountifully lavi[s]hed on her, her eyes are bright as the [s]tars, her lips like half blown ro[s]es, her hand and arm like poli[s]hed ivory. Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and favorite to the grand Vizier--in this low abject [s]tate my being is intolerable, I will no longer endure it but in yon limpid [s]tream lo[s]e the remembrance of my[s]elf and Semira. At this moment the Fairy Urganda [s]tood before her. "Thy complaints are ju[s]t, Oh! Fatima ([s]aid [s]he) and if thou wilt relinqui[s]h thy home, and for[s]ake thy father, thou [s]halt enjoy the utmo[s]t extent of thy wi[s]hes." Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms and the Fairy immediately [s]prinkled her with water at the [s]ame time  [s]ome my[s]tic words, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] when [s]he was transformed into a virgin of transcendent beauty, and found her[s]elf in the garden of a palace belonging to the grand Vizier. The lovely Semira had the day before offended her Lord, and was no longer a favorite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier--he ordered her to be led into [s]plendid apartments, clothed with co[s]tly robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed [s]laves to wait on her, and comply with all her wi[s]hes--and Fatima [s]upplied the place of the degraded Semira. She now thought her[s]elf the happie[s]t among the happy; but the Vizier was pa[s][s]ionate, capricious, jealous, and extremely cruel, and it was not long before the di[s]appointed Fatima di[s]covered that to be favorite to the grand Vizier, was to live only in [s]plendid [s]lavery. "But though ([s]aid [s]he often to her[s]elf) though the grand Vizier's favorite is mi[s]erable, how [s]uperlatively happy mu[s]t be the favorite Sultana of my Lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied [s]tation, how [s]oon [s]hould the imperious Vizier [s]uffer for his barbarity to me." Again did the bo[s]om of Fatima [s]uffer all the mi[s]eries of di[s]content--the vaulted roofs, spacious gardens, and rich pre[s]ents of the Vizier, no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] longer charmed her. She fighed for the en[s]igns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears. One evening [s]he retired to an arbour, at the extremity of the garden, and throwing her[s]elf on the banks where [s]he had fir[s]t [s]een Semira, thus poured [s]orth her complaints. "How wretched is the fate of Fatima--- condemned to drag a hated being with a man who [s]tudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the [s]lave of his caprice and pa[s][s]ion. Oh! could I but get from this dete[s]ted place, I would fly to my Lord the Emperor, and bow my [s]elf low in the du[s]t before him. My charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign the Empre[s]s of the Ea[s]t." As [s]he [s]poke the[s]e words, a [s]udden light entered the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again [s]tood before her. "Beautiful Fatima, [s]aid [s]he, forbear your complaints, the prophet permits you to enjoy your wi[s]h, then ri[s]e and follow me." The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and placed her among a number of beautiful [s]laves, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] from among which the Emperor was next morning to chu[s]e a favorite. In the morning the Emperor pa[s][s]ed through the apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She was cloathed in the enfigns of royalty, led in [s]tate to the mo[s]que, and in a few hours heard herself proclaimed Empre[s]s of the Ea[s]t. But Fatima had, to the idea of royalty, annexed the ideas of youth and beauty, how [s]urpri[s]ed was [s]he then to find the Emperor, old, ugly, and deformed in his per[s]on, moro[s]e in his di[s]po[s]ition, and jealous in the extreme---[s]he [s]hrunk from his embraces with horror, and contracted [s]o settled an aver[s]ion to him, that not all the [s]plendor that awaited her could in the [s]malle[s]t degree compensate for the many tedious hours [s]he was obliged to devote to him. Among the [s]laves that attended on Fatima, was the artful Zynina, who had long, with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor be[s]towed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingratiate her[s]elf in his favor, by rendering him [s]ome piece of [s]ervice. To this end [s]he cultivated the friend[s]hip of the new Queen, and by degrees drew from her the rea[s]on of her tears and dejection. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] This intelligence was in[s]tantly conveyed to the Emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart being dedicated to another. O[s]min willing to be convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration, de[s]ired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining the Queen's, where he might ea[s]ily overhear any thing that pa[s][s]ed between her and the deceitful [s]lave, who immediately returned to her mi[s]tre[s]s, and artfully renewed the conver[s]ation. Fatima, glad to unburthen her almo[s]t bur[s]ting heart, confe[s][s]ed her [s]ettled aver[s]ion to her Lord, and that death it[s]elf would be preferable to her pre[s]ent [s]ituation. "Then death be thy portion," cried the enraged Emperor, [s]uriou[s]ly ru[s]hing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering [s]cimitar. Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "O that I was an humble cottager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatne[s]s." At that moment [s]he found her[s]elf clad in her [s]ormer homely apparel, [s]tanding at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addre[s][s]ed her. "Fatima, I have [s]hewn you the vanity of human wi[s]hes, learn from hence to be content with the allotments of Providence, Whatever be your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] stiuation in life, [s]ubmit to it without repining, and know that our holy Prophet, who ordereth all things in this terre[s]trial world knoweth what is be[s]t for mortals: Fulfil therefore the re[s]pective duties of thy [s]tation, to the utmo[s]t of thy power: envy not the [s]uperior lot of another, but humbly take the ble[s][s]ings within thy reach, enjoy them and be happy.

Methinks, when I look round the world, I am ready to hail each member of [s]ociety as my brother or [s]i[s]ter, I rejoice in their [s]ucce[s]s, acknowledge their merit, admire their beauty, lament their misfortunes, and [s]hed the tear of [s]incere compassion over their vices. I would not  a heart ab[s]orbed in [s]elfi[s]h views for the univer[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] The man who lives only for him[s]elf, is, in my opinion, a mon[s]ter of ingratitude; his life is one continued blank, except marked by [s]ome act of inhumanity. If we mu[s]t  that day lo[s]t in which we perform no good action, what mu[s]t we think of a life pa[s][s]ed in a continued [s]eries of [s]tupid inattention to the di[s]tre[s][s]es or injuries of our fellow creatures. Hail! heaven-born charity! bright resplendent virtue; who[s]e dazzling rays hide from the accu[s]ing angel multitudes of offences, ble[s][s]ed is the heart thou do[s]t inhabit, happy is the man who[s]e actions are guided by thee. By charity I do not mean the merely [s]haring with tho[s]e that need the [s]uperabundant gifts of fortune, though ' tis certainly our duty to alleviate the misfortunes of others, yet by [s]o doing we do not fully di[s]charge the duties of chri[s]tianity. Charity is that benevolence of heart, that meekness of [s]pirit, which leads us to judge favorably of the actions of others, never to propagate a [s]tory to the injury of a neighbour's character, but to [s]tand forward the champion of innocence, and to defend tho[s]e, whom envy, malice, or revenge, have a[s]per[s]ed. Con[s]cious of its own rectitude, [s]u[s]pects not the integrity of another; ever ready to  the balm of con[s]olation into the heart wounded by [s]orrow; envies no per[s]on's [s]uperior [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] lot, but takes the portion a[s][s]igned by providence, with gratitude, u[s]es it with prudence, and gives the overplus to the [s]ons and daughters of poverty, looks round the world with a [s]mile of complacency, and wi[s]hes every bo[s]om as tranquil as its own. Yet there are people in the world who[s]e chief plea[s]ure con[s]i[s]ts in villifying and a[s]per[s]ing the characters even of their be[s]t friends, and [s]orry I am to [s]ay, tho[s]e characters are too frequently found among the fair [s]ex. Would they but consider, that while depre[s][s]ing the merits of another, they do not increa[s]e their own, but rather attract notice, and lead their acquaintance narrowly to the conduct of a woman, who is [s]o severe upon their errors, it would certainly, mea[s]ure, [s]top the unbounded licence they give their tongues. I do not know a more hateful character than Hecatissa, [s]he has indulged this evil propen[s]ity 'till it has become a part of her nature, and [s]he could no more entertain you for a few hours without a tale of [s]candal than [s]he could walk over the  surface of the ocean. Many is the feeling heart [s]he has wounded, many a breach of friend[s]hip has taken its ri[s]e from her malevolent tongue [s]he cares not how dear the ties [s]he endeavours to break, [s]he will [s]ow  between father and child, brother and [s]i[s]ter, hu[s]band and wife, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] exult in the mi[s]ery [s]he occa[s]ions; under the fairest [s]emblance of friend[s]hip, [s]he will [s]teal upon the un[s]u[s]pecting heart, and after being treated with unbounded confidence, like the ungrateful [s]erpent, [s]ting the brea[s]t that harbours her! She was, when very young, by the treachery of a near relation, thrown into a di[s]tre[s][s]ing situation, from which the bounty and genero[s]ity of a widow lady relieved her; not [s]atisfied with merely admini[s]tering to her pre[s]ent wants, [s]he took her into her family, and made her companion to her daughter. The innocent Anna conceived a [s]incere friendship for her, and for many years they lived like [s]i[s]ters; innumerable were the favours heaped on Hecati[s][s]a, who remained with the family; till a worthy man, attracted by her per[s]on and [s]pecious manner, made honorable propo[s]als and married her. Hecati[s][s]a might now have been the happie[s]t woman breathing--her hu[s]band was generous, humane, friendly, and good-natured to exce[s]s. He pre[s]ented her to his family, who received her cordially, and the poor ea[s]y good man thought he had in[s]ured his own [s]elicity, but Hecati[s][s]a [s]oon [s]hone forth in her own proper character. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] She planted di[s][s]ention in her hu[s]band's family, a[s][s]umed an unbecoming authority over all his actions, and by her artful a[s]cendancy contracted his heart, and made him treat with di[s]re[s]pect the very family who had [s]heltered her unprotected youth! Her vile in[s]inuations were aimed at the character of Anna, nor was [s]he the only object of her malice; every woman who po[s][s]e[s][s]ed superior endowments of per[s]on or mind, was to her a fit [s]ubject for [s]lander. She wi[s]hed no per[s]on to be more fortunate or happy than her[s]elf, [s]he listened to every malicious tale with avidity, repeated them with plea[s]ure, and aggravated every circumstance which had the lea[s]t appearance of vice or folly. She would [s]toop to [s]uch meanne[s]s, that rather than not compa[s]s a favorite point, [s]he would tamper with [s]ervants, to obtain the [s]ecrets of a family. She was once on a vi[s]it at the hou[s]e of Serena, [s]he found her beloved by her [s]ervants, re[s]pected by her friends, and tenderly e[s]teemed by her husband. Vexed to [s]ee how [s]uperior [s]he was in every re[s]pect to her[s]elf, [s]he eagerly watched for [s]ome opportunity to le[s][s]en her merit. She wre[s]ted the mo[s]t innocent and even laudable actions into guilt, [s]he poi[s]oned the minds of her [s]ervants, and traduced her reputation a[s][s]uming the appearance of humility and virtue, [s]he endeavoured to throw on Serena the odium of every vice which deformed her own character. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] But Serena was not long inveloped in the cloud Hecati[s][s]a had [s]pread over her; [s]he continued in the regular di[s]charge of the duties of her [s]tation, paid no regard to the malicious [s]landers [s]he daily heard, but, pitying the woman who could [s]o far forget truth and ju[s]tice as to blacken the character of one [s]he pro[s]e[s][s]ed a friend[s]hip for, treated her with the [s]ilent contempt her conduct merited. No [s]en[s]ible per[s]on will [s]cruple to affirm that Hecatissa is mi[s]erable. Hated and de[s]pi[s]ed by all her acquaintance, her [s]ociety is [s]hunned like the pestilence; and though by her con[s]ummate art [s]he [s]till impo[s]es upon her hu[s]band, and retains his affection, her di[s]content and ill-nature prevent her reaping any plea[s]ure in his company; [s]he is jealous, peevi[s]h and unea[s]y; in [s]hort [s]he has [s]uch a legion of torments in her own bo[s]om, that [s]he often applies to a comforting cordial to rai[s]e her depre[s][s]ed [s]pirits. However de[s]picable the character of Hecati[s][s]a may appear that of Prudelia is equally [s]o. Prudelia is a woman who pays the nice[s]t regard to propriety and decorum, [s]he is ever prying into her neighbour's conduct, and if their actions do not exactly agree with her [s]crupulous notions of rectitude, [s]he he[s]itates not to conclude them abandoned and lo[s]t to every [s]en[s]e of virtue. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] Albert and Julia had been married near four years, during which time they had lived in mutual love and confidence, when their ill-fortune took them to live in the [s]ame [s]treet with Prudelia. Albert followed the [s]ea, of con[s]equence Julia was often left for months together the guardian of her honor, the mi[s]tre[s]s of her own actions. She was lively in her di[s]po[s]ition, but her heart was the [s]eat of pure innocence. Albert was gone his accu[s]tomed voyage, when Prudelia undertook to [s]crutinize the conduct of Julia. Prudelia had vi[s]ited her, [s]he had been a witne[s]s to the innocent gaiety of her temper, [s]he had even pretended to admire her vivacity and good-humor, but [s]he whi[s]pered among her friends, that [s]he thought it was highly improper for a young woman like her, who[s]e hu[s]band was from home, to receive [s]o much company, or be [s]o frequent in her vi[s]its abroad. She watched every movement of Julia, was informed of all her vi[s]itors names, knew what time they came and went and even what hours [s]he retired to re[s]t and aro[s]e. Julia was a woman of nice feelings, [s]he was tenacious of honor; and the bare idea of that honor being [s]u[s]pected was extremely painful to her. She was unea[s]y at the watchful eye Prudelia kept upon her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] actions, not that [s]he feared to have them [s]rcutinized, but becau[s]e [s]he did not think her[s]elf obliged to be accountable for her conduct to any per[s]on but her hu[s]band. She therefore grew di[s]tant and re[s]erved, and whenever Prudelia called on her, gave little or no an[s]wer to her many artful que[s]tions concerning where [s]he had been, or how [s]he had [s]pent her time. About this time a brother of Julia's failed in business, he retired to a hou[s]e in the environs of West-minster, to avoid the importunity of his creditors. Julia was tenderly attached to her brother, [s]he exerted every power to [s]erve his di[s]tre[s][s]ed family, and even parted with her plate, and [s]ome other valuables, to rai[s]e money to [s]upply the pre[s]ent exigence. The attorney who had the care of [s]ettling her brother's affairs, was frequently with her for an hour or two together, and often [s]he went away with him in a coach, and was ab[s]ent for [s]everal days, as the bu[s]ine[s]s which employed [s]o large a [s]hare of her time, required [s]ecre[s]y, [s]he never mentioned it to Prudelia, nor did [s]he when going out ever tell the [s]ervant where [s]he was to be found. One morning the attorney had breakfa[s]ted with her and [s]he was gone with him to her brother, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] when Albert unexpectedly returned. The [s]ervant could give no account where her mi[s]tre[s]s was, and Prudelia who had [s]een him return, came over to invite him to dine with her family. I am [s]orry my Julia is from home, [s]aid he, but there was no po[s][s]ibility of her thinking to [s]ee me to day, as I am returned at lea[s]t [s]ix weeks before the time appointed. Why yes, replied Prudelia, with a [s]ignificant look, I fancy you will be a very unexpected gue[s]t. It will be an agreeable [s]urprize though, [s]aid Albert. Perhaps [s]o, [s]aid, Prudelia [s]miling, contemptnously. The [s]mile, the [s]ignificant look, alarmed Albert, have you any rea[s]on to think otherways, madam, [s]aid he? Surely Julia will be plea[s]ed with my return. Oh! mo[s]t certainly [s]he will, replied [s]he, [s]miling again; but, no doubt, [s]he would have liked a little more warning of your arrival. By heavens, madam, [s]aid Albert, your words di[s]tre[s]s me beyond mea[s]ure, you cannot mean to glance an a[s]per[s]ion at the character of Julia, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] yet what other motive can you have for tho[s]e contemptuous [s]miles. Tell me, dear madam, the meaning of the[s]e ambiguous looks; but hold, if it is any thing to Julia's di[s]advantage I [s]hall not believe it though uttered by an angel. Indeed, Sir, ([s]aid Prudelia, a[s][s]uming a [s]erious countenance, in which was blended a mixture of pity and anger) far be it from me to injure the reputation of any woman, or ever interfere between man and wife, you are united for life, and 'tis therefore your duty to bear with each others foibles, as well as you can. My Julia has no foibles, replied Albert, or if [s]he has I never di[s]covered them. I do not pretend to [s]ay [s]he has, my good friend, but I wi[s]h [s]he would come home. Albert joined the wi[s]h, and the day pa[s][s]ed on without much farther conver[s]ation. As the evening advanced he grew unea[s]y, and when the clock [s]truck ten, he exclaimed impatiently, where can [s]he be? Patience, my good Sir, [s]aid the artful Prudelia, you may not perhaps [s]ee her the[s]e two or three hours. Julia was not u[s]ed to keep [s]uch late hours, [s]aid he pen[s]ively. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] Oh! that is nothing, new connections form new manners; [s]he is never home much earlier, nay, 'tis very likely [s]he may not be at home to night. You [s]eem to be aiming at [s]omething, madam, [s]aid Albert, for heaven's [s]ake [s]peak out, and deliver me from this torture of [s]u[s]pence. This was the favourable moment for the vile incendiary--she prefaced her [s]candalous tale, with the [s]orrow [s]he felt at being obliged to give his worthy heart [s]o much pain, [s]aid, had Julia returned in any tolerable time, [s]he would have kept the affair to her[s]elf, but as [s]he found he already began to [s]u[s]pect [s]omething was ami[s]s, [s]he thought it was be[s]t he [s]hould be informed of the whole, that he might take his mea[s]ures accordingly. She then informed him, that during his ab[s]cence Julia's extravagance had known no bounds--- that [s]he had paid no regard to her reputation---received the con[s]tant vi[s]its of one particular gentleman, and made frequent excur[s]ions into the country with him, where [s]he [s]taid for [s]everal days, that to [s]upply her extravagance and that of her paramour, [s]he had parted with her watch, plate, and other valuables; and concluded with [s]aying, her heart bled to think [s]o worthy a man [s]hould be united to a woman who knew [s]o little how to value her good fortune. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] Albert li[s]tened with every mark of horror and a[s]toni[s]hment, at length([s]tarting from his [s]eat and [s]tamping his foot with vehemence)he cried, `tis every [s]yllable as fal[s]e as hell, my Julia can never have betrayed the honor I tru[s]ted to her care, or abu[s]ed the confidence I repo[s]ed in her. 'Tis well, Sir, replied Prudelia, with a look of offended pride, you doubt my veracity, however you will find the whole neighbourhood are acquainted with her errors, as well as I am, nay call your own [s]ervant, [s]he can a[s][s]ert the truth of what I [s]ay. The [s]ervant was called, [s]he confirmed the infamous tale, and Albert vowed to be revenged on his innocent wife. Prudelia had judged rightly, Julia did not return that night, and though Albert went home, and retired to his apartment, he never attempted to lye down, but traver[s]ed the room in the utmo[s]t agitation of [s]pirits during the whole night. In the mean time Julia was enjoying, with her brother's family, the mo[s]t exqui[s]ite [s]atisfaction. His failure was occa[s]ioned by remittances not arriving in proper time for him to make good [s]ome obligations he had entered into, the money Julia had rai[s]ed for him, had prevented immediate [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] bankruptcy, and that day [s]everal [s]hips had arrived with remittances, which would again enable him to appear among his friends with credit. The whole family were together at his lodgings, and a [s]mile of tranquillity [s]at on every countenance.--- How very happy I [s]hould be, [s]aid Julia, looking round her, if my Albert was joined in this loved company, I [s]hould then, at one view, behold all that is mo[s]t dear to me on earth. When [s]upper was over, the evening was far advanced, Julia propo[s]ed [s]taying with them all night, and walking home in the cool of the morning. She retired to re[s]t with a heart lightened of its cares, offered up a prayer for her Albert's safety, and [s]unk into an undi[s]turbed [s]lumber, little thinking the mi[s]eries that awaited her in the morning. At [s]ix o'clock [s]he aro[s]e, and ki[s][s]ing her little [s]leeping niece, who had been her bed-fellow, [s]tole [s]oftly down [s]tairs, and walked lei[s]urely towards home, enjoying the fre[s]hne[s]s of the morning, as [s]he walked thro' the park, and contemplating on the happy change in her brother's affairs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] It was near eight o'clock when [s]he arrived at her own door. My ma[s]ter is come home, madam, [s]aid the maid, as [s]he opened it. Home, cried Julia, in an accent of joyful surprize, and running eagerly up [s]tairs, opened the door of his apartment, and would have thrown her[s]elf into his arms, but he pu[s]hed her from him with violence, and cried by heavens, this affected joy [s]hall not cover your guilt; then looking at her [s]ternly, he added, how have you pa[s][s]ed this night, degenerate ungrateful Julia? Julia had never been addre[s][s]ed by Albert before but in a voice of the mo[s]t [s]oothing tenderne[s]s. She [s]taggered to the neare[s]t chair, and faintly exclaiming, what a horrid change is this, and bur[s]t into a violent flood of tears. Albert had never [s]een his Julia weep before, but his heart wept with her, but he now took her [s]urprize for a token of guilt, and imputed her tears to the effects of art. He therefore regarded them not, but walked about the room in [s]ullen [s]ilence. Oh! heavens, [s]aid Julia, what have I done to de[s]erve this; tell me, Albert, how have I forfeited your affection? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] By betraying my honor, [s]aid he fiercely, by becoming an abandoned wanton. Heaven is my witne[s]s, I have done neither, [s]aid [s]he, [s]inking on her knees, Oh! Albert, kill me in[s]tantly, but do not [s]u[s]pect my fidelity. I will ble[s]s you with my la[s]t breath, and dying, declare, I never entertained even a thought to the prejudice of your honor, or the purity of the affection I bear to you. Cur[s]ed di[s][s]embler, [s]aid the enraged Albert, and he [s]purned her from him with his foot. She [s]hrieked and fell, her head [s]truck the bed-po[s]t, and the blood gu[s]hed in a torrent from her forehead. Merciful heaven, cried he, I have murdered her. He caught her from the ground, but found neither [s]en[s]e nor breath remained. Frantic, he rang the bell for a [s]ervant, and [s]ent for immediate a[s][s]i[s]tance. A [s]urgeon examined her head, the [s]kull was fractured. After the wound was dre[s][s]ed [s]he opened her eyes, and fixed them upon her hu[s]band. Albert, [s]aid [s]he, I know not who has poisoned your mind, or how you could [s]u[s]pect the fidelity of Julia. Believe me, I am innocent, in my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf326v2&image=326-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] cabinet you will find papers, that will unravel any [s]eeming my[s]tery in my late conduct. I die, but dying ble[s]s you, for all your kindne[s]s to me. Ah! my love, 'tis not the wound I received on my head, but that which you inflicted on my heart, that terminates my exi[s]tence! I loved you too well, Albert, to feel the privation of your affetion and live; my heart unprepared to meet your unkindne[s]s [s]unk under it, [s]truggled and broke. She attempted to throw her arms round his neck, but nature was exhau[s]ted; [s]he could only [s]ay, Oh! ble[s]s him heaven --- and her [s]pirit took its flight to the regions of eternal day. Albert's di[s]tre[s]s was too great for de[s]cription, when he found he had by his blind pa[s][s]ion, terminated the exi[s]tence of an innocent, valuable woman, whom he loved with the mo[s]t [s]ervent affection. A deep melancholy [s]eized him, nor could all the attentions of his friends rou[s]e him from the torpid [s]tupor he had [s]unk into, he grew wor[s]e and wor[s]e, and ended his days in a mad-hou[s]e. As there are too many Prudelia's in the world, we cannot be too cautious how we believe a malevolent a[s][s]ertion, or give way to [s]u[s]picion and jealousy.
