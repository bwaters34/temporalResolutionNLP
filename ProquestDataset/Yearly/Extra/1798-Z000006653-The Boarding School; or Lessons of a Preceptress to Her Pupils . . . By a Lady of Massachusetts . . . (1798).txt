Convinced of the many advantages of a good education, and the importance of improving tho[s]e advantages; or of counterbalancing the want of them by exerting the mental powers which nature has bestowed; [s]en[s]ible, too, that the foundation of a u[s]eful and happy life mu[s]t be laid in youth, and that much depends on the early infu[s]ion of virtuous principles into the docile mind, the author has employed a part of her lei[s]ure hours in collecting and arranging her ideas on the [s]ubject of female deportment. How far [s]he has [s]ucceeded in her design, the voice of a candid public will pronounce.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] On the delightful margin of the Merrimac, in one of the mo[s]t plea[s]ant and beautiful [s]ituations, which that fertile and healthful part of America affords, lived Mrs. Williams, the virtuous relict of a re[s]pectable clergyman. She had two daughters, lovely and promi[s]ing as ever parent could boa[s]t. Mrs. Williams's circum[s]tances were ea[s]y. She po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a little patrimony, to which [s]he retired, after her hu[s]band's decea[s]e; but a de[s]ire of preserving this for her children, and a wi[s]h to promote their advantage and enlarge their [s]ociety, induced her to open a Boarding School. As [s]he had an eye, no le[s]s to the [s]ocial plea[s]ure, than to the pecuniary profit of the undertaking, [s]he admitted only [s]even, at a time, to the privilege of her tuition. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] The[s]e were all young ladies, who had previously received the fir[s]t rudiments of learning, and been initiated into the polite accomplishments, which embelli[s]h virtue and [s]often the cares of human life. They had generally lived in the metropolis, and had acquired the graces of a fa[s]hionable deportment; but they pro[s][s]e[s][s]ed different tempers and di[s]po[s]itions, which had been variou[s]ly, and, in [s]ome re[s]pects, erroneou[s]ly managed. To cultivate the expanding flowers, and to prune the juvenile eccentricities, which were diffeminated among the[s]e tender plants; or, to [s]peak without a figure, to extend and purify their ideas, to elevate and refine their affections, to govern and direct their pa[s][s]ions, required an eye, watchful, and a hand, [s]kilful as tho[s]e of the judicious Mrs. Williams. While her judgment and prudence aided the u[s]eful acqui[s]itions of the mind, a [s]prightly fancy and a cheerful di[s]po[s]ition, regulated by experience and di[s]cretion, qualified her to enter, at once, with becoming dignity and conde[s]cending ea[s]e, into all their concerns; to participate their plea[s]ures; while, with candour and mildne[s]s, [s]he reproved their errors, detected their follies, and facilitated their amendment. As the young ladies had fini[s]hed their [s]chool education, before Mrs. Williams received them to her man[s]ion, her in[s]tructions were more [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] e[s]pecially de[s]igned to poli[s]h the mental part, to call forth the dormant virtues, to unite and arrange the charms of per[s]on and mind, to in[s]pire a due [s]en[s]e of decorum and propriety, and to in[s]til [s]uch principles of piety, morality, benevolence, prudence and economy, as might be useful through life. Their time was, accordingly, di[s]po[s]ed in a manner mo[s]t conducive to the attainment of the[s]e objects. Every part of it was employed to [s]ome valuable purpo[s]e; "for idlene[s]s," Mrs. Williams ob[s]erved, "is the ru[s]t of the mind." Whatever tended to enlarge, inform, improve, or amu[s]e, [s]he [s]uppo[s]ed worthy their attention. She particularly endeavoured to dome[s]ticate them; to turn their thoughts to the beneficial and nece[s][s]ary qualifications of private life; often inculcating, that "Nothing lovelier can be found in woman, Than to [s]tudy hou[s]ehold good;" and labouring to convince them of the utter insignificance and u[s]ele[s][s]ne[s]s of that part of the [s]ex, who are "Bred only and completed to the ta[s]te Of lu[s]tful appetence; to [s]ing, to dance, To dre[s]s, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye." Early ri[s]ing [s]he recommended, both by precept and example. This, [s]he [s]aid, would not only [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] promote their health, but render them mi[s]tre[s][s]es of many hours, which mu[s]t otherwi[s]e be lo[s]t in enervating [s]loth and inaction. "And [s]hould we," continued [s]he, "who have [s]o much cau[s]e for exertion, thus [s]acrifice the be[s]t part of our time?" "Falfely luxurious, will not man awake, And, [s]tarting from the bed of [s]loth, enjoy The cool, the fragrant, and the [s]ilent hour, To meditation due, and [s]acred [s]ong? And is there aught in [s]leep can charm the wife? To lie in dead oblivion, lo[s]ing half The fleeting moments of too [s]hort a life? Total extinction of th' enlighten'd [s]oul! Or el[s]e to feveri[s]h vanity alive, Wilder'd and to[s][s]ing through di[s]temper'd dreams? Who would in [s]uch a gloomy [s]tate remain, Longer than nature craves; when every mu[s]e, And every blooming plea[s]ure wait without, To ble[s]s the wildly devious morning walk?" Another laudable practice of Mrs. Williams, was perfect regularity in the government of her pupils, and in the arrangement of their daily exerci[s]es. "When," [s]aid [s]he, "we ob[s]erve the order of the natural world, and admire the consistency and harmony of every part, we may hence derive a le[s][s]on, for the regulation of our conduct, in the [s]phere a[s][s]igned to us." Pur[s]uant to this plan of operation, the young ladies aro[s]e at five; from which they had two hours at their own di[s]po[s]al, till the bell summoned them at [s]even, to the hall, where, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] ceremonies of the morning [s]alutation over, they breakfa[s]ted together; their repa[s]t being [s]ea[s]oned with the unre[s]trained effu[s]ions of good humour and [s]ociability. On the[s]e occa[s]ions, Mrs. Williams [s]u[s]pended the authority of the matron, that, by accu[s]toming her pupils to familiarity in her pre[s]ence, they might be free from re[s]traint; and, feeling perfectly ea[s]y and unawed, appear in their genuine characters. By this mean [s]he had an opportunity of ob[s]erving any indecorum of behaviour, or wrong bias; which [s]he kept in mind, till a proper time to mention, and remonstrate again[s]t it; a method, the [s]alutary effects of which were vi[s]ible in the daily improvement of her pupils. The breakfa[s]t table removed, each took her needle-work, except one, who read [s]ome amusing and in[s]tructive book, for the benefit and entertainment of the re[s]t. The [s]ubject was selected by Mrs. Williams, who conferred the reading upon them in rotation. At twelve o'clock, they were di[s]mi[s][s]ed till one, when dinner again called them together, which was conducted in the [s]ame manner as the morning repa[s]t. Having re[s]umed their occupations, the reader of the day produced [s]ome piece of her own compo[s]ition, either in pro[s]e, or ver[s]e, according to her inclination, as a [s]pecimen of her genius and improvement. This being [s]ubmitted to Mrs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] Williams's in[s]pection, and the candid peru[s]al and critici[s]m of her companions; and the [s]ubject canva[s][s]ed with great freedom of opinion, they withdrew from the ta[s]ks of the day to [s]eek that relaxation and amu[s]ement, which each preferred. No innocent gratification was denied them. The [s]prightly dance, the [s]entimental [s]ong, and indeed every [s]pecies of pa[s]time, con[s]i[s]tent with the decorum of the [s]ex, was encouraged, as tending to health, cheerfulne[s]s, and alacrity. In the[s]e plea[s]ing pur[s]uits and enjoyments, the pre[s]ent cla[s]s of happy companions had nearly completed the term allotted them by their parents, and were [s]oon to leave the peaceful [s]hades in which they delighted, when, being a[s][s]embled on the Monday morning of their la[s]t week, their revered Preceptre[s]s thus acco[s]ted them: "As the period is approaching, my dear pupils, when I mu[s]t re[s]ign your [s]ociety, and quit the important charge of in[s]tructor and friend, which I have [s]u[s]tained with [s]o much plea[s]ure, and, I tru[s]t, with [s]ome degree of fidelity, I [s]hall [s]um up the coun[s]els, admonitions, and advice, which I have frequently inculcated, and endeavour to impre[s]s them on your minds, as my valedictory addre[s]s. For this purpo[s]e, during this la[s]t week of your re[s]idence with me, I [s]hall dispense with your u[s]ual exerci[s]es, and [s]ub[s]titute a collection of my own [s]entiments, enforced by the pathos of the occa[s]ion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] "Your docility, and cheerful diligence in attending to my in[s]tructions; your mode[s]t, affectionate, and re[s]pectful behaviour, together with the laudable progre[s]s you have made in every branch, which you have pur[s]ued, have well rewarded my care, and engaged my approbation and love. To me, therefore, a [s]eparation will be painful. To you the period is important. It is a period, which, while it relieves you from the confinement of [s]chola[s]tic rules, introduces you to new [s]cenes of cares, of plea[s]ures, of trials, and of temptations, which will call for the exerci[s]e of every virtue, and afford opportunity for improving the endowments, both natural and acquired, which you po[s][s]e[s]s. Think not, then, that your emancipation from [s]chools, gives you liberty to neglect the advantages which you have received from them. The obligations under which you are laid to your parents for the education they have given you, require a diligent improvement of every talent committed to your tru[s]t. "Of needle-work you are complete mi[s]tre[s][s]es, from the mo[s]t delicate and highly fini[s]hed, to the mo[s]t ordinary, though perhaps not le[s]s u[s]eful, economy of mending and making the coar[s]er garments of family u[s]e. Many, I am aware, [s]uppo[s]e this laft a [s]pecies of learning, which is beneath the attention of a lady: but Clara will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-017a.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] tell you how valuable it has proved to her; and how valuable it may prove to you. "Nur[s]ed in the lap of affluence, and accustomed to unbounded expen[s]e, Clara little thought, at your age, that [s]he [s]hould ever depend on her needle for the livelihood and decent appearance of a ri[s]ing family. A di[s]creet and prudent mother early inculcated the le[s][s]ons of indu[s]try and economy, which [s]he now practices; and taught her that the knowledge could be of no di[s][s]ervice, though [s]he never had occa[s]ion for it. She married with the brighte[s]t pro[s]pects. But a [s]eries of unavoidable di[s]a[s]ters, [s]uch as no human wisdom could fore[s]ee or prevent, reduced her to narrow circum[s]tances; and, to complete her misfortune, [s]he was left a widow with four [s]mall children. Her parents were in the grave; her patrimony was gone! In this exigence, what was her re[s]ource? Not fruitle[s]s lamentations, and unavailing complaints. She immediately [s]ummoned her re[s]olution; and by the u[s]e of her needle has ever [s]ince [s]upported her[s]elf and family with decency, and been highly re[s]pected for her prudent exertions and exemplary indu[s]try. Directly the rever[s]e of this amiable character is that of Belinda. She was educated in the [s]ame way with Clara; the [s]ame [s]chools gave them tuition; and [s]imilar pro[s]spects awaited their entrance into life. Calamities attended the progre[s]s of each; but different as their tempers and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] disposttions was their conduct under them. The falling fortunes of Clara were awhile [s]u[s]pended by her di[s]cretion and frugality; while the ruin of Belinda was ha[s]tened by her extravagance, diffipation, and idlene[s]s. View them, now, in their reduced [s]tate! Neatne[s]s, cheerfulne[s]s, and activity pre[s]ide in the dwelling of Clara; negligence, peevi[s]hne[s]s, and [s]loth are legibly [s]tamped on that of Belinda. The ear is pained by her complaints of poverty; the eye is di[s]gu[s]ted by her [s]latternly appearance, and oftentatious di[s]play of the tattered remnants of finery, which be[s]peak the pride and indolence of their owner; who will neither convert them into more comfortable garments, nor, by repairing, render them becoming. "I hope, however, that occa[s]ions like the[s]e may never call for your exertions. But there may be ca[s]es, when, to know the u[s]e of your needles will an[s]wer important purpo[s]es, even in an exalted [s]tation, and amid[s]t the [s]plendor of affluence and plenty. "Matilda dignified a princely fortune by the exerci[s]e of every virtue which can adorn a lady. Among the[s]e, charity [s]hone con[s]picuous. Her maid [s]aid to her, one day, Madam, would you have me lay a[s]ide the[s]e ca[s]t-clothes for [s]ome poor per[s]on? Yes, replied Matilda; but [s]it down, and mend them fir[s]t. Don't you [s]ee they need it? Why, Madam, rejoined the girl, is it not enough [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] for you to give them away? I [s]hould think the lea[s]t they can do is to mend them for themselves! In that ca[s]e, [s]aid Matilda, my bounty would be greatly dimini[s]hed. People, who need charity have not the nece[s][s]ary materials for putting [s]uch articles into repair; and [s]hould I furnish them, perhaps they have never been taught to u[s]e their needles. No more have I, returned the maid. Have you not? [s]aid Matilda. Well then, [s]it down, and I will direct your ingenuity upon the[s]e clothes. By this mean you may learn a very u[s]eful le[s][s]on, I a[s][s]ure you; a le[s][s]on, which by practi[s]ing for your[s]elf, will enable you to lay up part of your wages again[s]t the time when [s]ickne[s]s or old age [s]hall take you from your labours. "Such examples of conde[s]cen[s]ion and benevolence to inferiors, are of more real and la[s]ting u[s]e than pounds prodigally be[s]towed. "Do you [s]eek higher te[s]timonies of the honor and utility of this employment? You may collect many from the hi[s]tories which you have read during the la[s]t year. Among the Romans, and [s]everal other nations of antiquity, a [s]carf, wrought by the needle of a favourite fair, was received as an honorable token of re[s]pect, and improved as an invincible [s]timulus to heroic deeds. Ladies of the fir[s]t rank and [s]tation con[s]idered it as no derogation from the dignity or delicacy of their character, to make their own apparel, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] and that of their families. The virtuous Panthea, when her hu[s]band was going to fight in the cau[s]e of Cyrus, her generous deliverer, magnificently adorned his per[s]on, and decorated his armour with her own needle-work. "We ought never to be idle. No moment [s]hould be unoccupied. Some employment, salutary, either to body or mind, or both, [s]hould be con[s]tantly pur[s]ued; and the needle is always at hand to [s]upply the want of other avocations. The li[s]tle[s]s vacuity, which [s]ome young ladies indulge, renders them extremely unhappy, though they are in[s]en[s]ible of the cau[s]e, and [s]eek to beguile the time in frivolous amu[s]ements. "A [s]till more endearing motive remains to be [s]ugge[s]ted; and that is the plea[s]ure, which your accompli[s]hments in this ornamental and u[s]eful art mu[s]t afford your parents; and the pain, which your neglect of it hereafter mu[s]t occa[s]ion them. "But your faithful and affiduous improvement of time, [s]ince you have been with me, is a [s]ure pledge of your per[s]everance in the path of duty, and your progre[s]s in every virtue. I tru[s]t, therefore, that what I have [s]aid will be engraved on your memories; and that [s]ome u[s]eful ideas will be [s]elected by each of you for your future advantage. "Your minds are a good [s]oil; and may I not flatter my[s]elf, that the [s]eeds of in[s]truction which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] I have [s]own, "will [s]pring up, and yield fruit abundantly?" With one voice, they mo[s]t affectionately a[s][s]ured Mrs. Williams, that it [s]hould be their daily [s]tudy to profit by her le[s][s]ons; and withdrew. READING. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] Being a[s][s]embled, this afternoon, Mrs. Williams thus re[s]umed her di[s]cour[s]e. "Reading is [s]o common a part of education, that the value of it is not duly e[s]timated; nor the manner of performing it, [s]ufficiently attended to. It is not the mere propriety of pronunciation, accent, and cadence, which con[s]titutes good reading. You mu[s]t enter into the [s]pirit of the [s]ubject, and feel intere[s]ted in the matter, before you can profit by the exerci[s]e. "But you are [s]o well acquainted with the manner of reading, that the quality of books mo[s]t worthy of your peru[s]al is the only point on which I need to enlarge. "Romances, the ta[s]te of former times, are now [s]o far out of vogue, that it is hardly nece[s][s]ary to warn you again[s]t them. They exhibit the [s]pirit of chivalry, knight-errantry, and extravagant folly, which prevailed in the age they depict. But they are not intere[s]ting; nor can they be plea[s]ing to the correct ta[s]te and refined delicacy of the pre[s]ent day. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] "Novels are the favourite, and the mo[s]t dangerous kind of reading, now adopted by the generality of young ladies. I [s]ay dangerous, because the influence, which, with very few exceptions, they mu[s]t have upon the pa[s][s]ions of youth, bears an unfavourable a[s]pect on their purity and virtue. The [s]tyle in which they are written is commonly captivating; and the luxurlance of the de[s]criptions with which they abound, extremely agreeable to the [s]prightly fancy, and high expectations of the inexperienced and unreflecting. Their romantic pictures of love, beauty, and magnificence, fill the imagination with ideas which lead to impure de[s]ires, a vanity of exterior charms, and a fondne[s]s for [s]how and di[s][s]ipation, by no means con[s]i[s]tent with that [s]implicity, mode[s]ty, and cha[s]tity, which [s]hould be the con[s]tant inmates of the female brea[s]t. They often pervert the judgment, mi[s]lead the affections, and blind the understanding. "A melancholy example of this [s]ort is exhibited in Juliana. Juliana was the only daughter of a wealthy merchant, who grudged no expense which could plea[s]e or embelli[s]h his darling child. He, however, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed neither leisure nor abilities "to teach the young idea how to [s]hoot;" but thought it [s]ufficient that he gave her every advantage, which could be derived from the various [s]chools, to which [s]he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] consigned. She had a brilliant fancy, and a fondness for books, which, properly directed, might have proved of great u[s]e to her. But, having no better principles in[s]tilled into her mind, [s]he indulged her[s]elf in the unlimited reading of novels, and every light publication which a circulating library could furni[s]h. "Hence her imagination took wing, and carried her far above the [s]cenes of common life. The exce[s][s]ive refinement of her mind admitted no ordinary amu[s]ements or avocations. Plain truth from her own [s]ex was an in[s]ult; and from the other, nothing le[s]s than adoration would fatisfy her unbounded vanity. Her beauty (of which [s]he really had a con[s]iderable [s]hare) and the large fortune which [s]he would probably inherit, gained her many admirers; [s]ome of whom were men of unque[s]tionable merit. But a [s]ober, rational court[s]hip could not an[s]wer her ideas of love and gallantry The [s]wain, who would not die for her, [s]he deemed unworthy of notice. "Her father [s]trongly recommended a gentleman, as well calculated, in his opinion, to make her happy, and as having his entire approbation; but [s]he rejected him with di[s]dain, though [s]he could produce no one objection again[s]t his person, or character. "Her father acquie[s]ced; expre[s][s]ing, however, his regret at the mi[s]taken notions [s]he had imbibed; and warning her mo[s]t pathetically again[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] the indulgence of [s]o romantic a di[s]po[s]ition; yet all in vain. He was con[s]idered as an illiterate plodder after wealth, which [s]he had a right to be[s]tow as [s]he plea[s]ed. "At la[s]t the lovely youth whom [s]he had [s]o long contemplated, made his appearance. A military captain entered the town on the recruiting [s]ervice. Young, hand[s]ome, ea[s]y, bold and assuming; with all the bon ton of the coxcomb, and all the in[s]olence of the novice. He [s]aw Juliana; he [s]acrificed to her charms, and conquered. She could not re[s]i[s]t the allurements of his gallantry. His affectation of dying love was received with apparent plea[s]ure; while art and duplicity took advantage of her weakne[s]s, to precipitate her into engagements to pity and relieve him. Her friends [s]aw her danger, and warmly remon[s]trated again[s]t her imprudent conduct, in receiving the addre[s][s]es of a man, de[s]titute of property to [s]upport her, and void of every kind of per[s]onal merit. Her father entreated and implored the rejection of her lover, till, finding every other method vain, he at length resolutely forbade him the hou[s]e, and his daughter's company. This was viewed as per[s]ecution; and, con[s]i[s]tently with her [s]entiments of adventurous love, a clande[s]tine amour was commenced. Her father [s]urpri[s]ed them together; and, enraged at their di[s]graceful intrigue, [s]eized the captain, and endeavoured to turn him out of doors. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] He violently re[s]ented this ungentlemanlike treatment, as he termed it, and defended him[s]elf with his [s]word. The old gentleman received a [s]light wound, in the [s]cuffle; but accompli[s]hed his purpo[s]e. Juliana was terrified at this rencounter, and, dreading her father's di[s]plea[s]ure, ran out with her paramour. His lodgings were near, and thither, favoured by the darkne[s]s of the night, he in[s]tantly led her. She involuntarily followed him, without con[s]idering the impropriety of her conduct. Here he drew his [s]word, and, throwing him[s]elf at her feet, professed his de[s]pair, and declared him[s]elf re[s]olved to put an immediate end to his life. She endeavoured to rea[s]on him into calmne[s]s; but in vain. He was [s]en[s]ible, that, if he now relinquished her to her father, he [s]hould lo[s]e her forever. His apparent agony overcame her, and [s]he gave him her hand. "Her father was almo[s]t di[s]tracted at her elopement. He traced her [s]teps, and, following her to the hou[s]e, conde[s]cended to [s]oothe her with parental kindne[s]s; and promi[s]ed her pardon and continued affection, if [s]he would renounce her worthle[s]s lover, and return. She confe[s][s]ed it was too late; that [s]he was his wife. "Petrified with a[s]toni[s]hment, he looked at her, for [s]ome time, with [s]peechle[s]s grief; and, showing his arm, bound up with the wound he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] received, left her with every token of angui[s]h and indignation! "When the fever of pa[s][s]ion had abated, a returning [s]en[s]e of duty in Juliana, and, in the captain, the fear of lo[s]ing the property which hesought, induced them to [s]eek a reconciliation, and make [s]ubmi[s][s]ive efforts to obtain it. But her father was too highly incen[s]ed to grant it to him, on any terms; or to her, on any other than the utter rejection of her unworthy companion. The[s]e terms were not complied with. "Sorrow and vexation preyed [s]o deeply upon the mind of this afflicted parent, that they brought on a rapid decline; and he died without again [s]eeing his undutiful and ruined daughter. His e[s]tate was divided between Juliana and her four brothers. Her portion was received by her hu[s]band, and [s]oon [s]pent in di[s][s]ipation and excess. Having rioted on the fortune of his wife, while [s]he often pined at home for want of the common nece[s][s]aries of life, he left her, to join his regiment, promi[s]ing remittances from time to time, for her [s]upport. This promi[s]e, however, was but ill performed; and [s]he now feels the dreadful effects of her folly, in the accumulated ills of poverty and neglect. Yet [s]he [s]till cheri[s]hes the mo[s]t pa[s][s]ionate fondne[s]s for what has proved her bane. A friend called to [s]ee her, not long [s]ince, and found her the emblem of wretchedness and [s]loth. Her emaciated form, her [s]qualid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] appearance, the di[s]order of her hou[s]e, and her tattered raiment, be[s]poke the [s]hameful negligence of the owner. Yet [s]he was [s]itting with a novel in her hand, over which [s]he had apparently been weeping. She expatiated largely on the tale it contained, while her children, who exhibited a picture of real woe, engaged not her attention. Her friend enquired how [s]he could be thus intere[s]ted and di[s]tre[s][s]ed by mere fiction, while every thing about her was calculated to arou[s]e the keene[s]t feelings of her [s]oul! She coolly replied, I have fortitude [s]ufficient to support my own calamity, but I mu[s]t [s]ympathize with the heroine of adver[s]ity. I have not lo[s]t my [s]en[s]ibility with my fortune. My only luxury is now imagination! How ill-timed, and how improperly exerted, was this kind of [s]en[s]ibility, in Juliana! Where, and what was her sensibility, when [s]he di[s]obeyed an indulgent parent, [s]acrificed her reputation, and threw her[s]elf into the arms of a worthle[s]s man for protection--- from what? from the kindne[s]s and love of her be[s]t friends! "But I would not be under[s]tood to condemn all novels indi[s]criminately; though great prudence is nece[s][s]ary to make a u[s]eful [s]election. Some of them are fraught with [s]entiment; convey le[s][s]ons for moral improvement; and exhibit [s]triking pictures of virtue rewarded; and of vice, folly, and indi[s]cretion puni[s]hed; which may [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] prove encouragements to imitate, or warnings to avoid [s]imilar practices. I [s]hall not de[s]cend to particulars. Tho[s]e, which are [s]anctioned by the general voice of delicacy and refinement, may be allowed a reading; yet none [s]hould engro[s]s your minds, to the neglect of more important objects; nor be [s]uffered to monopolize too large a portion of your time. "Novels are a kind of light reading, on which the imagination fea[s]ts, while the more substantial food which is requi[s]ite to the nouri[s]hment of the under[s]tanding, is either unta[s]ted or undigested. Imagination is a [s]portive faculty, which [s]hould be curbed by the reins of prudence and judgment. Its [s]allies are delightful in youth, provided they be not too excur[s]ive. "Poetry is, by [s]ome, ranked with novels; but I think injudiciou[s]ly. Good poetry is certainly a [s]ublime [s]ource of entertainment and instruction. What mu[s]ic is to the ear, poetry is to the heart. There mu[s]t indeed, be a natural ta[s]te for it, before it can be highly reli[s]hed or enjoyed; and this ta[s]te, wherever it exi[s]ts, [s]hould be cultivated. I know of no kind of reading more richly formed for the mental repa[s]t of a liberal and poli[s]hed young lady, than the poetical productions of true genius. The trifling and indelicate cantos of ordinary witlings, and everyday poeta[s]ters, are unworthy your attention. But the [s]pecies of poetry which I now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] recommend, is peculiarly adapted to [s]often the pa[s][s]ions, excite [s]ympathy, and meliorate the affections. It [s]oothes the jarring cares of life, and, pervading the [s]ecret rece[s][s]es of the [s]oul, [s]erves to rou[s]e and animate its dormant powers. "Many e[s][s]ays, written by monitors of both [s]exes, are extant, which you may find profitable and plea[s]ing, both in youth and more advanced age. Among the foremo[s]t of the[s]e, I mention Mrs. Chapone's letters to her niece, which contain a valuable trea[s]ure of information and advice. "But among your hours devoted to reading, hi[s]tory mu[s]t not be without a place. Here an exten[s]ive field of ages and generations, which have gone before you, is opened to your view. Here your curio[s]ity may be gratified by a retrospection of events, which, by conducting your thoughts to remote[s]t climes and periods, interests and enlarges the mind. Here the various revolutions, the ri[s]e, fall, and di[s]memberment of ancient kingdoms and [s]tates may be traced to the different [s]prings of action, in which they originated. Hence you may gain a competent acquaintance with human nature in all its modifications, from the mo[s]t rude and barbarous, to the mo[s]t civilized and poli[s]hed [s]tages of society. This is a [s]pecies of knowledge, which will not only be of con[s]tant u[s]e to you, in the government of your own temper and manners, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] highly ornamental in your intercour[s]e with the polite and learned world. "But let your reading of every de[s]cription be regular and methodical. Never confu[s]e your minds by a variety of [s]ubjects at once. When you turn your attention to any one in particular, fini[s]h, and lay that a[s]ide, before you take up another. Let what you read be well understood at the time, and well dige[s]ted afterwards. Po[s][s]e[s]s your[s]elves, at lea[s]t, of the leading traits: otherwi[s]e your labour will be totally lo[s]t. If convenient, always recapitulate what you have been peru[s]ing, and annex to it your own [s]entiments and remarks, to [s]ome friend. If you have no friend at hand, who will be di[s]po[s]ed to hear, recollect, and run it over in your own thoughts. This will be a great a[s][s]i[s]tance to memory. But whatever be the kind of reading which you undertake, [s]elect [s]uch authors as good judges esteem the be[s]t, upon the [s]ubject. Have a particular regard to the morality and delicacy of the books you peru[s]e. "When you read for mere amu[s]ement, (which [s]hould [s]eldom happen) be careful not to corrupt and vitiate your ta[s]te by frothy and illiberal performances, which will degrade the dignity and fully the purity of your minds. That time is very greatly mi[s]pent, which is be[s]towed in reading what can yield no in[s]truction. Not a moment's attention [s]hould be given to books which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] afford not [s]ome degree of improvement. Always have an eye, therefore, to profit, as well as to plea[s]ure. Remember that youth is the feed-time of life. You are now to cultivate that knowledge, which future years mu[s]t ripen. Free from tho[s]e dome[s]tic cares, which will engro[s]s and occupy your minds, when placed at the head of families, a mo[s]t ine[s]timable price is now put into your hands to get wi[s]dom. Now you may learn; then you mu[s]t practice. "Now, therefore, lay up in [s]tore [s]ome provision for every exigence, [s]ome embelli[s]hment for every [s]tation. "Look upon Elvira. Her acquirements in a [s]ingle [s]tate have qualified her for a [s]hining pattern of matronal duties. Her hu[s]band's bu[s]ine[s]s abroad prevents him from attending to dome[s]tic avocations; nor need he be anxious re[s]pecting the management of his hou[s]ehold affairs. Elvira is pre[s]ent to every occa[s]ion. The superintendence of her family, and the education of her children is her delight. Capable of in[s]tructing them in every needful branch of [s]cience, and of furni[s]hing them with every requi[s]ite endowment, [s]he is, at once, their guide, their example, and their friend. When her hu[s]band returns from the cares and fatigues of bu[s]ine[s]s, with what becoming ea[s]e and cheerfulne[s]s does [s]he di[s][s]ipate the anxiety which [s]ometimes hangs upon his brow, and exhilerate his [s]pirits by the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] enlivening charms of rational and refined conversation! In the entertainment of their friends, how di[s]tingui[s]hed a part [s]he [s]u[s]tains! Her powers of mind have been [s]o happily improved, that [s]he is able to di[s]cu[s]s every [s]ubject with ea[s]e and propriety. To an enlarged under[s]tanding and a cultivated ta[s]te, to an exten[s]ive knowledge of the world and an acquaintance with polite literature, [s]he [s]uperadds tho[s]e amiable virtues, which give [s]ociety its highe[s]t reli[s]h; while the elegance of her manners and the mode[s]ty of her deportment are a proof of the greatne[s]s of her mind, and render her e[s]teemed, beloved, and re[s]pected by all who know her. "But I [s]latter my[s]elf that each of you, my dear pupils, will be an Elvira. Then will you do ju[s]tice to the [s]uperior advantages of your education; be the delight of your friends, and the ornaments of your country. "Religious [s]ubjects mu[s]t, by no means, be neglected in the cour[s]e of your reading. Let the Bible be the rule of your faith and practice. If you wi[s]h an explanation of any particular passages, [s]eek it from [s]ome judicious and pious friend, or in the writings of [s]ome judicious and learned commentator. But always attend chiefly to tho[s]e points which [s]erve to mend the heart, rather than to tho[s]e knotty, metaphy[s]ical disquisitions, which tend only to perplex the understanding, and involve the inquirer in [s]uch [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] labyrinths of ab[s]tru[s]ity, as are above human comprehension, and beyond human concern. The e[s][s]ential doctrines and precepts of the go[s]pel are level to every capacity; and upon a life and conversation governed by the[s]e, our hopes, both of pre[s]ent peace and future glory, mu[s]t be founded.

"Writing is productive both of plea[s]ure and improvement. It is a [s]ource of entertainment which enlarges the mental powers more, perhaps, than any other. The mind is obliged to exertion for materials to [s]upply the pen. Hence it collects new [s]tores of knowledge, and is enriched by its own labours. It imperceptibly trea[s]ures up the ideas, which the hand impre[s][s]es. An opportunity is furni[s]hed of reviewing our sentiments before they are expo[s]ed; and we have the privilege of correcting or expunging [s]uch as are erroneous. For this purpo[s]e, you will find it a good method to collect and write your thoughts upon any [s]ubject that occurs; for by repeatedly arranging and revi[s]ing your expre[s][s]ions and opinions, you may daily improve them, and learn to think and rea[s]on properly on every occa[s]ion. By this mean you may likewi[s]e provide yourselves with a fund of matter for future u[s]e, which, without this a[s][s]i[s]tance, the memory [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] would not retain. It will be of great [s]ervice to note down in your common-place book [s]uch particulars as you may judge worth remembering, with your own ob[s]ervations upon them. This will be a kind of amu[s]ement which will exerci[s]e your thinking powers at the time, and, by recurring to it afterwards, it may afford you many u[s]eful hints. "The frequent u[s]e of the pen is calculated to refine and enlarge your under[s]tandings. Have you any talent at compo[s]ition? it will be increa[s]ed by cultivation. "Neglect no opportunity, therefore, which your lei[s]ure affords, of delighting your friends, and accompli[s]hing your[s]elves by the exerci[s]e of your genius in this way. "Thrice ble[s][s]ed are we, the happy daughters of this land of liberty, where the female mind is un[s]hackled by the re[s]traints of tyrannical cu[s]tom, which in many other regions confines the exertions of genius to the u[s]urped powers of lordly man! Here virtue, merit, and abilities are properly e[s]timated under whatever form they appear. Here the widely extended fields of literature court attention; and the American fair are invited to cull the flowers, and cultivate the expanding laurel. "But the [s]pecies of writing, which is open to every capacity, and ornamental to every [s]tation, is the epi[s]tolary. This, between particular friends, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] is highly agreeable and intere[s]ting. It is a method of interchanging [s]entiments, and of enjoying intercour[s]e with tho[s]e from whom you are far removed, which is a happy [s]ub[s]titute for personal conver[s]ation. In a corre[s]pondence of this [s]ort, all affectation, formality, and bomba[s]t [s]hould be laid a[s]ide. "Ea[s]e, frankne[s]s, [s]implicity, and [s]incerity [s]hould be its leading traits. Yet let not your letters be compo[s]ed of mere [s]ounding terms, and verbo[s]e egoti[s]m; but intermix [s]entiment with expre[s][s]ion, in [s]uch a manner as may be improving as well as plea[s]ing. Letters of friend[s]hip [s]hould conduce no le[s]s to the advantage than entertainment of the per[s]on addre[s][s]ed; and mere cur[s]ory letters, of general acquaintance, mu[s]t, at lea[s]t, be written with propriety and accuracy. The formation of the characters, the [s]pelling, the punctuation, as well as the [s]tyle and [s]en[s]e, mu[s]t be attended to. "Never omit noticing the receipt of letters, unless you mean to affront the writers. Not to answer a letter, without being able to a[s][s]ign [s]ome [s]pecial rea[s]on for the neglect, is equally unpardonable as to keep [s]ilence when conver[s]ation is addre[s][s]ed to you in per[s]on. "By habituating your[s]elves to writing, what may, at fir[s]t, appear a ta[s]k, will become extremely plea[s]ant.

"One of the [s]ages of antiquity being a[s]ked why he was [s]o long in writing his opinion, replied, "I am writing for futurity." "Your characters during life, and even when you [s]hall [s]leep in the du[s]t, may re[s]t on the efforts of your pens. Beware then how you employ them. Let not the merit of your attainments in this noble art be degraded by improper [s]ubjects for its exerci[s]e. Suffer not the expectation of [s]ecrecy to induce you to indulge your pens upon [s]ubjects, which you would blu[s]h to have exposed. In this way your characters may be injured, and your happine[s]s de[s]troyed. "Celia and Cecilia were companions at a boarding [s]chool. When [s]eparated, they commenced an epi[s]tolary corre[s]pondence, on which each valued her[s]elf. Their former intimacy, which they termed friend[s]hip, prompted them to write with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] unlimited confidence; and, without the lea[s]t reserve, to reveal every dictate of levity and thoughtless folly. They imagined them[s]elves perfectly [s]ecure from the cen[s]ure of the critic. Their education had not taught them, that a virtuous mind [s]hould [s]hrink even from ideal indelicacy. Celia was courted by Silvander, a young man of whom [s]he was pa[s][s]ionately fond; but [s]he had art and re[s]olution enough to conceal her letters from his in[s]pection, though he often [s]olicited a communication of her corre[s]pondence. At length he became impatient for a peru[s]al of letters which appeared [s]o plea[s]ing and intere[s]ting to the parties, and [s]u[s]picious that [s]ome particular cau[s]e directed their privacy. Influenced by the[s]e motives, Silvander bribed a market-boy, who came from the village where Cecilia lived, and always conveyed the letters to and from her, to give them fir[s]t into his hand. How a[s]toni[s]hed was he to find the lightne[s]s of mind exemplified in them! Purity of [s]entiment, delicacy of thought, and refinement of ta[s]te were entirely laid a[s]ide; and illiberal wit, frothy je[s]ts, double entendres, and ridiculous love-tales were [s]ub[s]tituted in their place. His name was u[s]ed with [s]o much freedom, and every circum[s]tance relative to his intercourse, and propo[s]ed connexion with Celia, was bandied with [s]uch familiarity, that he was mortified, di[s]gu[s]ted, and chagrined, in the extreme. He had the policy, however, to conceal [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] the di[s]covery till he had copied a con[s]iderable number of Celia's letters, leaving out whatever had reference to his own affairs. He then revenged him[s]elf by di[s]clo[s]ing his knowledge to her, avowing his indignation at her weakne[s]s, duplicity and folly, and taking an immediate and final leave. Not content with this, he even circulated her letters among his acquaintance. This fixed the [s]tamp of ignominy on the correspondents; and their names and characters were rendered as ridiculous as [s]candal and malicious wit could de[s]ire. "Celia was almo[s]t di[s]tracted at the lo[s]s of her lover; but when [s]he found the method he had taken to puni[s]h her indi[s]cretion, and that her reputation was thus materially injured, [s]he secluded her[s]elf, in a great mea[s]ure, from [s]ociety. Her [s]en[s]ibility received a wound which could never be healed; and [s]he lived and died in melancholy, regret, and ob[s]curity. "However cen[s]urable the unju[s]t and ungenerous conduct of Silvander may be deemed, yet no adequate excu[s]e can be offered for the young ladies, who di[s]honored their pens and their talents by a mo[s]t improper and unbecoming u[s]e of both. "Next to writing, arithmetic u[s]ually claims attention. This is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary in every department, and in every [s]tage of life.

But, leaving your matronal conduct to future admonition, many benefits result from keeping regular accounts in a [s]ingle [s]tate. Your parents allow you a certain [s]um for your own private u[s]e. Fa[s]hion and folly are always bu[s]y in creating innumerable imaginary wants, which mu[s]t exceed your finances, if you do not attend to an exact adju[s]tment of your expenditures. For this purpo[s]e, always calculate your immediate and mo[s]t nece[s][s]ary demands. Let the[s]e be fir[s]t [s]upplied, and then, if your funds be not exhau[s]ted, more [s]uperfluous ones may occupy your thoughts. There is one claim, however, which mu[s]t not be neglected, and that is CHARITY. You will, therefore, manage your expen[s]es in [s]uch a manner as to re[s]erve [s]ome portion of your income for the nece[s][s]itous. Should you think your allowance in[s]ufficient to admit the children of want to a [s]hare, let your benevolence plead for the retrenchment of [s]ome trifling article which you may di[s]pen[s]e with, without much inconvenience; and the exqui[s]ite plea[s]ure re[s]ulting from the be[s]towment, will more than counterbalance the [s]acrifice.

He was the affectionate parent of a numerous family, to who[s]e education and improvement he attended with unwearied diligence and plea[s]ure; till repeated lo[s][s]es in trade, and di[s]appointments in his worldly expectations embarra[s][s]ed his affairs, depressed his [s]pirits, and impaired his health. In the mid[s]t of the[s]e difficulties, his amiable and beloved wife was removed by death. This trial was greater than he could [s]upport. He [s]unk under the affliction, and lo[s]t his rea[s]on. Lucinda was the elde[s]t of [s]ix children, the care of whom, with the melancholy ta[s]k of attending and ministering to the nece[s][s]ities of her unhappy father, devolved on her. She looked upon the woe-fraught [s]cence, and wept. Her heart was [s]inking under the weight of grief; and hope, the be[s]t [s]oother of the unfortunate, had nearly abandoned her. She advi[s]ed with her friends, who propo[s]ed to relieve the family by means of a [s]ub[s]cription. Lucinda thanked them for their proffered kindness, and returned to her di[s]con[s]olate habitation. She deliberated on the projected mea[s]ure; which [s]he con[s]idered mu[s]t be [s]low, uncertain, and, at any rate, inadequate to their future exigences.

Yet what could be done? One re[s]ource only remainded;---her own exertions. By the[s]e [s]he [s]lattered her[s]elf, that [s]he might [s]ave the family from [s]uffering want, and di[s]charge the obligations [s]he owed to her revered parent. Her education, by which, among other branches of learning, [s]he had been well in[s]tructed in arithmetic, (that being her father's favourite [s]tudy) qualified her for this undertaking. She therefore devoted her[s]elf to the bu[s]ine[s]s without delay; examined her father's accounts, collected whatever remained that was valuable; [s]old the [s]uperfluous moveables, and purcha[s]ed a [s]mall [s]tock for trade. All who knew her motives and merit frequented her [s]hop, and encouraged her by their cu[s]tom and kindne[s]s. By this mean, together with her judicious management, and engaging behaviour, [s]he increa[s]ed her bu[s]ine[s]s to [s]uch a degree, as to support the family with ea[s]e and reputation. "Her di[s]creet and dutiful conduct to her father, [s]oon re[s]tored him to his rea[s]on. "When he found how prudently and affectionately Lucinda had exerted her[s]elf in his behalf, he exclaimed, "Many daughters have done virtuou[s]ly, but thou excelle[s]t them all!"

"In mu[s]ic and dancing you have made [s]uch proficiency that your performances mu[s]t be very plea[s]ing to your friends, before whom you occasionally exhibit. "As dancing is an accompli[s]hment merely external, let not the vanity of excellence in it betray it[s]elf in an air of con[s]cious [s]uperiority, when you [s]hine at the ball, and perceive your[s]elves to have attracted the attention and applau[s]e of the gay a[s][s]embly. But in the mid[s]t of hilarity and mirth, remember that mode[s]ty, diffidence, discretion, and humility are indi[s]pen[s]able appendages of virtue and decency. "Mu[s]ic is a talent which nature has be[s]towed, and which your application has con[s]iderably improved. It has a powerful influence over the heart; wonderfully [s]oothes and humanizes the pa[s][s]ions, and is a [s]ource of refined plea[s]ure to a mind capable of ta[s]ting its charms.

"Let us view this eva[s]ive manner of [s]eeking compliments a little nearer. When a per[s]on is known to be mi[s]tre[s]s of this delightful art, what can be her motive for delaying the gratification of her friends by its exerci[s]e, and refu[s]ing a compliance with their wi[s]hes, till their patience is exhau[s]ted? I believe that excu[s]es, in this ca[s]e, are very [s]eldom [s]incere. The youthful mind is not in[s]en[s]ible to prai[s]e, nor indifferent to the means of obtaining it. "Why then [s]hould it not be received and increased by a ready and obliging compliance?

"Mu[s]ic and dancing, though polite and elegant accompli[s]hments, are, perhaps, the mo[s]t fascinating, and, of cour[s]e, the mo[s]t dangerous of any that fall under that de[s]cription. When indulged to exce[s]s, be[s]ide engro[s][s]ing much time which ought to be employed in the execution of more nece[s][s]ary and u[s]eful de[s]igns, they sometimes allure their fond votaries from that purity and rectitude which are the chief embelli[s]hments of the female character. They lay the mind open to many temptations, and, by nouri[s]hing a frivolous vanity, benumb the nobler powers both of reflection and action. "Levitia was endowed, by the joint influence of nature and art, with the[s]e plea[s]ing charms. Symmetry was perfected in her form; and her voice was melody it[s]elf.

To adorn her per[s]on, regulate her movements, and practi[s]e her mu[s]ic, was all her care. Nor had [s]he a wi[s]h beyond the pleasures, which [s]he fancied they could yield. Her mind re[s]embled a garden, in which the u[s]eful plants are overrun and choaked by noxious weeds. Here and there a gaudy flower rears its brilliant head, and proudly dares to arre[s]t the eye; while the delicate and u[s]eful lie buried and concealed in the [s]urrounding wa[s]te! "Flattery was plea[s]ing to her car, in whatever form it was pre[s]ented. The gay and licentious fought her [s]ociety; and vanity with its attendant train of follies led her imagination far from the [s]phere of life which Providence had a[s][s]igned her. Her parents [s]aw their own mi[s]take, and were alarmed at her's: but, alas! too late were their endeavours to prevent the mi[s]chiefs which impended.

She was deceived by the vanity of appearing where her fancied merit would meet with the encouragement and reward it de[s]erved; and vainly imagining that her beauty might [s]ecure her elevation and affluence, [s]he readily con[s]ented to the fatal experiment, eloped from her father's hou[s]e, and became a profe[s][s]ed actre[s]s. "Her parents were overwhelmed with grief and anxiety, at the di[s]covery; but to no purpo[s]e were all their exertions to reclaim her. She had left them, no more to return; left them, too, with the heart-rending reflection, that they themselves had heedle[s]sly contributed to her di[s]grace and ruin. But bitter indeed were the fruits of her di[s]obedience and folly! "She made her appearance on the [s]tage. She [s]ung and danced, for which [s]he was care[s][s]ed, flattered, and paid.

Her pretended lover, finding [s]he could no longer be useful to him, perfidiou[s]ly abandoned her to poverty and [s]hame. She returned, like the prodigal, to her unhappy father, who received, but could not a[s][s]i[s]t her.

To plea[s]e and oblige tho[s]e friends who are intere[s]ted in her happine[s]s, and gratified by her performances, is her delight. Nor does [s]he think it nece[s][s]ary, by [s]eigned excuses, to delay the plea[s]ure, which [s]he is able to afford; but willingly enhances that plea[s]ure by a ready and cheerful compliance. This [s]he thinks the be[s]t return [s]he can make for their kind attention. Though delighted with the[s]e amusements her[s]elf, [s]he, neverthele[s]s, con[s]iders them as amu[s]ements only; and a[s][s]iduou[s]ly cultivates the more [s]olid branches of her education. The[s]e, [s]he is wont to [s]ay, may render me u[s]eful and happy, when the voice of mu[s]ic [s]hall be brought low, and when the [s]prightly limbs [s]hall become languid and inactive.

Temptations lurk around to beguile your feet a[s]tray; and dangers which appear in[s]urmountable will often ari[s]e to affright you from the ways of virtue.

At your entrance on the [s]tage of action, the allurements of plea[s]ure will [s]pread innumerable charms to court your acceptance. Beware of their fascinating wiles; and whatever cour[s]e you adopt, be [s]ure it is [s]uch as will bear the te[s]t of examination and reflection. Let the[s]e be the criterion of all your pur[s]uits and enjoyments. Make it an invariable practice to re-trace the actions and occurrences of the day, when you retire to re[s]t; to account with your own hearts for the u[s]e and improvement of the pa[s]t hours; and rectify whatever you find ami[s]s, by greater vigilance and caution, in future; to avoid the errors into which you have fallen, and to di[s]charge the duties incumbent upon you.

A young lady, un[s]killed in the deceitful arts of a giddy world, is very apt to be mi[s]led by the adulation which is offered at the [s]hrine of vanity. She is con[s]idered as a mark for the wit of every coxcomb, who wi[s]hes to di[s]play his gallantry. "Flattery is a dazzling meteor, which ca[s]ts a delu[s]ive glare before the eye; and which [s]educes the imagination, perverts the judgment, and silences the dictates of [s]ound rea[s]on. Flattery is, therefore, the poi[s]on and bane of the youthful mind. It renders the receiver blind to tho[s]e defects which [s]he ought to [s]ee and rectify, and proud of imaginary graces which [s]he never yet po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. Self-knowledge, as before ob[s]erved, will facilitate the detection of this di[s]gui[s]ed adversary, by enabling you to inve[s]tigate your real accompli[s]hments and merits. "That prai[s]e which is the re[s]ult of de[s]erved approbation from tho[s]e, who[s]e good opinion you wi[s]h to enjoy, is worthy your attention and grateful acceptance: but the ful[s]ome compliments and hyperbolical profe[s][s]ions of unmeaning and empty pretenders, calculated only to fill the imagination with the inflammable air of [s]elf-conceit and arrogant pride, [s]hould be rejected with disdain, and cordially de[s]pi[s]ed by every lady of [s]en[s]e and [s]entiment, as an in[s]ult upon her understanding, and an indignity to her [s]en[s]ibility.

"In order to di[s]criminate between flattery and merited prai[s]e, critically examine your own heart and life. By this mean you will a[s]certain what is really your due, and what is merely the effect of this in[s]idious art. But let no ideas of your own endowments, however ju[s]t, elate you with an opinion of your [s]uperior powers of plea[s]ing. "Be not o[s]tentatious of your charms, either of per[s]on or mind. Let mode[s]ty, diffidence, and propriety regulate you, in regard to each. Exalted advantages will render you an object of envy to the weak minded of your own [s]ex, and of [s]atire to the ill-natured part of the other. Never obtrude even your real graces and accomplishments upon the world. The penetrating and judicious will [s]ee and applaud them, while retiring from the gaze of a misjudging and mi[s]repre[s]enting throng.

Hence men are often captives of a face, They know not why; of no peculiar grace. Some forms, tho' bright, no mortal man can bear; Some none re[s]i[s]t, tho' not exceeding fair." "Beauty, my dear girls, is indeed a de[s]irable quality. Neither the pen of the morali[s]t, nor the [s]pleen of the [s]atyri[s]t, nor the envy of [s]uch as want it, could ever bring it into contempt or neglect.

A [s]uperficial, but fashionable education added the allurements of art to tho[s]e of per[s]on, and rendered her a fini[s]hed coquette.

Her mind was barren of improvement, and consequently de[s]titute of re[s]ources. "She vainly imagined the triumphs of beauty to be permanent, till its declared enemy, the [s]mall-pox, convinced her of the egregious mistake. By this [s]he found her empire [s]uddenly overturned.

A [s]uitable attention to the etiquette of appearance is nece[s][s]ary to render us re[s]pectable in the eyes of the world; and di[s]covers an accommodating di[s]po[s]ition, which is, at once, engaging and u[s]eful in the commerce of [s]ociety. Females are taxed with being peculiarly attached to, and captivated by the glare of [s]plendor and [s]how. But I believe [s]uperficial minds are not confined to [s]ex. Whatever form they actuate, to beautify and adorn it will be the principal object. "A certain [s]pecies of gaiety and airine[s]s is becoming in youth.

Extravagance is a great error, even where fortune will allow the means of [s]upporting it.

"Leander, a gentleman of liberal education, [s]uperior merit, and hand[s]ome property, ca[s]t his eye around for a companion to [s]hare and enjoy the[s]e advantages with him. Loui[s]a caught his attention. The elegance of her per[s]on, and [s]plendor of her appearance, charmed his imagination, and in[s]pired the idea of a fortune [s]ufficient to [s]upport her expen[s]ive [s]tyle of living. He paid his addre[s][s]es, and was received with the mo[s]t flattering encouragement. But how great was his di[s]appointment, when he di[s]covered the [s]mallne[s]s of her re[s]ources, and the imprudence of her management! This, [s]aid he to him[s]elf, will never do for me. Were my income far [s]uperior to what it is, it would not be adequate to [s]uch unbounded extravagance. Be[s]ides, where [s]o little economy is practi[s]ed, while under parental government, what mu[s]t be the consequence of that unlimited indulgence, which the confidence due to a wife demands? Were I to abridge her expen[s]es, and endeavour to rectify her fanta[s]tical ta[s]te, it would doubtle[s]s foment dissension, di[s]cord, and animo[s]ity, which mu[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] terminate in wretchedne[s]s. He re[s]olved, however, to try her real di[s]po[s]ition, by gently hinting his di[s]approbation of her gaiety. This [s]he re[s]ented; and a rupture, which ended in a final [s]eparation, en[s]ued. She found, too late, the value of the man, whom [s]he had [s]lighted; and ever after regretted that [s]olly which had irretrievably alienated his affections. "The mode[s]ty and neatne[s]s of Clarinda's garb next caught Leander's eye. Conver[s]ing with her on the [s]ubject of dre[s]s, the ju[s]tne[s]s of her sentiments gave him the highe[s]t ideas of the rectitude and innocence of her mind. A co[s]tly article was offered for her purcha[s]e; but [s]he refue[s]ed it. It would not become me, [s]aid [s]he, nor any other per[s]on who has not an affluent fortune. If I had a [s]ufficiency to buy it, I would procure something more [s]imple and nece[s][s]ary for my[s]elf; and the overplus might render an object of di[s]tre[s]s contented and happy. "Yet was Clarinda always elegantly neat; always genteelly fa[s]hionable. Frugality and economy, free from profu[s]ion and extravagance, enabled her to indulge her own ta[s]te entirely; and while [s]he enjoyed that, [s]he repined not at the fancied [s]uperiority of others. Leander found her all he wi[s]hed, in appearance; all he hoped for, in reality. As their ta[s]tes were correspondent, and their highe[s]t aim, when united, to plea[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] each other, they were not dependent on the breath of fa[s]hion for their happine[s]s.

"But [s]hould there be no other motive than that of plea[s]ing your a[s][s]ociates, and rendering them happy, by making your[s]elves agreeable, it may be confidered as a [s]ufficient inducement to the practice of this branch of good-breeding. Many girls, in the thoughtle[s]s levity of their hearts, divert them[s]elves at the expen[s]e of others; and, with the utmo[s]t glee, point out any thing peculiar in the appearance, words, or actions of [s]ome one in the company, whom they [s]elect for a subject of merriment and ridicule. This, by [s]hrewd looks, ironical ge[s]tures, or tittering whi[s]pers, is kept up, to the great mortification of the unhappy victim, and to the reproach and di[s]honor of the offenders.

But the artful Florio, de[s]irous of protracting the plea[s]ure of her company, took a circuitous route, which con[s]iderably increa[s]ed the di[s]tance to her father's hou[s]e. However, he conveyed her [s]afely home, though not [s]o [s]oon as [s]he wi[s]hed. She found that Leontine had been there, and had gone to vi[s]it a friend; but would [s]oon return. Leontine was ju[s]t [s]eated at his friend's, when Lavina entered. "She told the circle, that Florio had ju[s]t pa[s][s]ed her, and that he had company [s]he little expected to [s]ee with him. They inquired if it was his former mi[s]tre[s]s? No, [s]aid [s]he, he has di[s]carded her [s]ome time ago, and if we may judge by appearances, has cho[s]en a new one. Upon being a[s]ked who, [s]he pre[s]umed to name Eudocia. Every countenance expre[s][s]ed [s]urpri[s]e and regret. In Leontine's, rage and re[s]entment were vi[s]ibly depicted. He ro[s]e, and [s]tepping ha[s]tily to Lavina, told her he was a party concerned, and demanded an explanation of what [s]he had infinuated. She perceived that [s]he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] given offence, and endeavoured to excu[s]e herself; but he re[s]olutely told her that no eva[s]ions would avail; that he in[s]i[s]ted on the real truth of her [s]candalous report. Finding him thus determined, [s]he related the [s]imple fact of [s]eeing Eudocia in a carriage with Florio, who was a known libertine, and accu[s]tomed to the [s]ociety of loo[s]e women. Leontine a[s]ked her how [s]he came to a[s][s]ociate the ideas [s]he had mentioned with Eudocia's name? She replied that the lightne[s]s of her behaviour had [s]ometimes rendered her cen[s]urable; and [s]he thought this in[s]tance, in particular, authorized [s]u[s]picion. Leontine could not deny that [s]he was culpable in appearance; yet made answer, that though [s]candal might fea[s]t on the failings of virtue, he believed Eudocia's innocence much purer, and her heart much better than her detracters'; and, taking his hat, he wished the company a good evening, and left them. "His pa[s][s]ions were on fire. He could not comprehend the my[s]terious conduct of Eudocia. Her ab[s]ence from home, at a time when he expected her to receive him, and her being [s]een at a di[s]tance, in company with a profe[s][s]ed debauchee, were a labyrinth which he could not explore. Though he doubted not Eudocia's honor, yet her folly and imprudence, in [s]ubjecting her character to [s]u[s]picion and reproach, he thought unpardonable. His re[s]entment determined him to break the propo[s]ed connexion immediately; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] and, left his love [s]hould get the better of his re[s]olution, he went directly to the hou[s]e. "As he could not command his temper, he appeared extremely agitated, and angrily told Eudocia that [s]he had cau[s]ed him great uneasiness; and that he came to claim the [s]atisfaction of knowing, why [s]he had avoided his [s]ociety, and made an a[s][s]ignation with a man who had involved her in infamy? Eudocia was a[s]toni[s]hed, and ju[s]tly offended at this addre[s]s. With all the dignity of con[s]cious innocence, [s]he replied, that as yet he had no right to challenge an account of her conduct; but for her own [s]ake, [s]he would conde[s]cend to give it. This [s]he did, by a faithful and undi[s]gui[s]sed relation of facts. She then a[s]ked him, if he was [s]atisfied. He an[s]wered, No. For, [s]aid he, though you have cleared your[s]elf of guilt, in my apprehen[s]ion, you will find it very difficult to free your character from the blemi[s]h it has received in the opinion of the world. Saying this, he told her, that, however highly he e[s]teemed her, [s]o opposite were their di[s]po[s]itions, that they mu[s]t often be at variance; and [s]o nice was his [s]en[s]e of honor, that his wife, like Caefar's, mu[s]t not only be virtuous, but un[s]u[s]pected. She rejoined, that his [s]entiments were apparent; and if what he then expre[s][s]ed were his opinion of her, it was be[s]t they [s]hould part.

"The impropriety of her conduct, and her lo[s]ing the affections of a man [s]he too ardently loved, together with the cruel treatment [s]he had ju[s]t received from him, overwhelmed her with grief, and produced the mo[s]t violent emotions of regret. She walked her room in all the anguish of di[s]appointed hope. Her parents u[s]ed every argument to [s]oothe and con[s]ole her; but in vain.

An account of her di[s]order had rou[s]ed him to a [s]en[s]e of his ra[s]hne[s]s, and he begged to be admitted to her chamber; but this [s]he utterly denied.

At that time [s]he was at nur[s]e in a neighbouring village; between which and the metropolis, all communication being cut off, he was reduced to the nece[s][s]ity of leaving her to the mercy of tho[s]e to whom [s]he was entrusted. Having received her from pecuniary motives only, they no [s]ooner found them[s]elves deprived of the profits of their labour and care, than they fought relie[s] by an application to the town for her [s]upport. A wealthy farmer in the vicinity, who had often [s]een and been pleased with the dawning charms of Flavia, pitied her condition; and having no children of his own, re[s]olved to [s]helter her from the impending [s]torm, till [s]he could be better provided for.

The approbating [s]mile of Flavia was the reward of their toils, and the favour of her hand in the ru[s]tic dance was emulou[s]ly [s]ought. "In this [s]tate, Flavia was happy.

"But the arrival of her father, who had been permitted to return, and re-po[s][s]e[s]s the e[s]tate which he had abandoned, put a period to the [s]implicity and peace of Flavia's mind.

"Next in rank and importance to filial piety, is fraternal love. This is a natural affection which you cannot too a[s][s]iduou[s]ly cultivate. How delightful to [s]ee children of the [s]ame family dwell together in unity; promoting each other's welfare, and emulous only to excel in acts of kindness and good will.

"The attentions of a libertine, in[s]tead of putting them on their guard again[s]t encroachments, induced them to triumph in their fancied conquests, and to boa[s]t of re[s]olution [s]ufficient to [s]hield them from delu[s]ion. "Love, however, which, with [s]uch dispositions, is the pretty play-thing of imagination, assailed the tender heart of Serena. A gay youth, with more wit than [s]en[s]e, more [s]how than substance, more art than hone[s]ty, took advantage of her weakne[s]s to ingratiate him[s]elf into her favour, and per[s]uade her they could not live without each other. Augu[s]ta was the confident of Serena. She fanned the flame, and encouraged her re[s]olution of promoting her own felicity, though at the expen[s]e of every other duty. Her parents [s]u[s]pected her amour, remon[s]trated again[s]t the man, and forbad her forming any connexion with him, on pain of their di[s]plea[s]ure. She apparently acquie[s]ced; but flew to Augu[s]ta for coun[s]el and relief. Augu[s]ta [s]oothed her anxiety, and promi[s]ed to a[s][s]i[s]t her in the accompli[s]hment [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] of all her wi[s]hes. She accordingly contrived means for a clande[s]tine intercour[s]e, both personal and epi[s]tolary. "Ari[s]tus was a foreigner, and avowed his purpose of returning to his native country, urging her to accompany him. Serena had a fortune, independent of her parents, left her by a decea[s]ed relation. This, with her hand, [s]he con[s]ented to give to her lover, and to quit a country, in which [s]he acknowledged but one friend. Augu[s]ta praised her fortitude, and favoured her de[s]ign. She accordingly eloped and embarked. Her parents were almo[s]t di[s]tracted by her imprudent and undutiful conduct; and their re[s]entment fell on Augu[s]ta, who had acted contrary to all the dictates of integrity and friend[s]hip, in contributing to her ruin; for ruin it proved. Her ungrateful paramour, having rioted on the property which [s]he be[s]towed, abandoned her to want and de[s]pair. She wrote to her parents, but received no an[s]wer. She repre[s]ented her ca[s]e to Augusta, and implored relief from her friend[s]hip; but Augu[s]ta alleged that [s]he had already incurred the di[s]plea[s]ure of her family on her account, and cho[s]e not again to [s]ubject her[s]elf to cen[s]ure by the [s]ame means. "Serena at length returned to her native [s]hore, and applied in per[s]on to Augu[s]ta, who coolly told her that [s]he wi[s]hed no intercour[s]e with a vagabond, and then retired. Her parents refu[s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] to receive her into their hou[s]e; but, from motives of compa[s][s]ion and charity, granted her a [s]mall annuity, barely [s]ufficient to keep her and her infant from want. "Too late [s]he di[s]covered her mi[s]taken notions of friend[s]hip; and learned by [s]ad experience, that virtue mu[s]t be its foundation, or [s]incerity and con[s]tancy can never be its reward. "Sincerity and con[s]tancy are e[s][s]ential ingredients in virtuous friend[s]hip. It invariably [s]eeks the permanent good of its object; and in [s]o doing, will advi[s]e, caution and reprove, with all the frankne[s]s of undi[s][s]embled affection. In the interchange of genuine friend[s]hip, flattery is utterly excluded. Yet, even in the mo[s]t intimate connexions of this kind, a proper degree of respect, attention, and politene[s]s, mu[s]t be ob[s]erved. You are not [s]o far to pre[s]ume on the partiality of friend[s]hip, as to hazard giving offence, and wounding the feelings of per[s]ons, merely becau[s]e you think their regard for you will plead your excu[s]e, and procure your pardon. Equally cautious [s]hould you be, of taking umbrage at circumstances which are unde[s]ignedly offen[s]ive. "Hear the excellent advice of the wi[s]e [s]on of Sirach, upon this [s]ubject: "Admoni[s]h thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he have done it, that he do it no more. Admoni[s]h thy friend; it may be he hath not [s]aid it; and if he have, that he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] [s]peak it not again. Admoni[s]h thy friend; for many times it is a [s]lander; and believe not every tale. There is one that [s]lippeth in his [s]peech, but not from his heart; and who is he that offendeth not with his tongue?" "Be not ha[s]ty in forming friend[s]hips; but deliberately examine the principles, di[s]po[s]ition, temper, and manners, of the per[s]on you wi[s]h to [s]u[s]tain this important character. Be well a[s][s]ured that they are agreeable to your own, and [s]uch as merit your entire e[s]teem and confidence, before you denominate her your friend. You may have many general acquaintances, with whom you are plea[s]ed and entertained; but in the chain of friend[s]hip there is a [s]till clo[s]er link. "Re[s]erve will wound it, and di[s]tru[s]t de[s]troy. Deliberate on all things with thy friend; But [s]ince friends grow not thick on ev'ry bough, Nor ev'ry friend unrotten at the core, Fir[s]t, on thy friend, deliberate with thy[s]elf: Pau[s]e, ponder, [s]ift; not eager in the choice, Nor jealous of the cho[s]en: fixing, fix: Judge before friend[s]hip; then confide till death." "But, if you would have friends, you mu[s]t [s]how your[s]elves friendly; that is, you mu[s]t be careful to act the part you wi[s]h from another. If your friend have faults, mildly and tenderly repre[s]ent them to her; but conceal them as much as po[s][s]ible from the ob[s]ervation of the world.

"Should [s]he [s]o far deviate, as to endanger her reputation and happine[s]s; and [s]hould your admonitions fail to reclaim her, become not, like Augu[s]ta, an abettor of her crimes. It is not the part of friend[s]hip to hide tran[s]actions which will end in the ruin of your friend. Rather acquaint tho[s]e who ought to have the rule over her of her intended mi[s]teps, and you will have di[s]charged your duty; you will merit, and very probably may afterwards receive, her thanks. "Narciffa and Florinda were united in the bonds of true and generous friend[s]hip. Narciffa was called to [s]pend a few months with a relation in the metropolis, where [s]he became acquainted with, and attached to a man who was much her inferior; but who[s]e [s]pecious manners and appearance deceived her youthful heart, though her rea[s]on and judgment informed her, that her parents would di[s]approve the connexion. When [s]he returned home, the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of her fault, the frankne[s]s which [s]he owed to her friend, and her partiality to her lover, wrought powerfully upon her mind, and rendered her melancholy. Florinda [s]oon explored the cau[s]e, and warmly remonstrated again[s]t her imprudence in holding a moment's intercour[s]e with a man, who, [s]he knew, would be di[s]plea[s]ing to her parents. She [s]earched out his character, and found it far inadequate to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] Narci[s][s]a's merit. This [s]he repre[s]ented to her in its true colours, and conjured her not to [s]acrifice her reputation, her duty, and her happine[s]s, by encouraging his addre[s][s]es: but to no purpo[s]e were her expo[s]tulations. Narci[s][s]a avowed the de[s]ign of permitting him to [s]olicit the con[s]ent of her parents, and the determination of marrying him without it, if they refu[s]ed. "Florinda was alarmed at this re[s]olution; and, with painful anxiety, [s]aw the danger of her friend. She told her plainly, that the regard [s]he had for her demanded a counteraction of her de[s]ign; and that if [s]he found no other way of preventing its execution, [s]he [s]hould di[s]charge her duty by informing her parents of her proceedings. This Narci[s][s]a re[s]ented, and immediately withdrew her confidence and familiarity; but the faithful Florinda neglected not the watchful [s]olicitude of friend[s]hip; and when [s]he perceived that Narci[s][s]a's family were re[s]olutely oppo[s]ed to her projected match, and that Narci[s][s]a was preparing to put her ra[s]h purpo[s]e into execution, [s]he made known the plan which [s]he had concerted, and by that mean prevented her de[s]truction. Narci[s][s]a thought her[s]elf greatly injured, and declared that [s]he would never forgive [s]o flagrant a breach of fidelity. Florinda endeavoured to convince her of her good intentions, and the real kindne[s]s of her motives; but [s]he refu[s]ed to hear the voice of wi[s]dom, till a [s]eparation from her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] lover, and a full proof of his unworthine[s]s, opened her eyes to a [s]ight of her own folly and indi[s]cretion, and to a lively [s]en[s]e of Florinda's friend[s]hip, in [s]aving her from ruin without her con[s]ent. Her heart overflowed with gratitude to her generous pre[s]erver. She acknowledged herself indebted to Florinda's benevolence, for deliverance from the baneful impetuo[s]ity of her own pa[s][s]ions. She [s]ought and obtained forgiveness; and ever after lived in the [s]tricte[s]t amity with her faithful benefactre[s]s." LOVE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] " The highe[s]t [s]tate of friend[s]hip which this life admits, is in the conjugal relation. On this refined affection, love, which is but a more intere[s]ting and tender kind of friend[s]hip, ought to be founded. The [s]ame virtues, the [s]ame dispositions and qualities which are nece[s][s]ary in a friend, are [s]till more requi[s]ite in a companion for life. And when the[s]e enlivening principles are united, they form the ba[s]is of durable happine[s]s. But let not the ma[s]k of friend[s]hip, or of love, deceive you. You are now entering upon a new [s]tage of action, where you will probably admire, and be admired. You may attract the notice of many, who will [s]elect you, as objects of adulation, to di[s]cover their ta[s]te and gallantry; and perhaps of [s]ome who[s]e affections you have really and [s]eriou[s]ly engaged. The fir[s]t cla[s]s your penetration will enable you to detect; and your good [s]en[s]e and virtue will lead you to treat them with the neglect they de[s]erve. It is di[s]reputable for a young lady to receive and encourage the officious attentions of tho[s]e mere plea[s]ure-hunters, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] rove from fair to fair, with no other de[s]ign than the exerci[s]e of their art, addre[s]s, and intrigue. Nothing can render their company plea[s]ing, but a vanity of being care[s][s]ed, and a fal[s]e pride in being thought an object of general admiration, with a fondne[s]s for flattery which be[s]peaks a vitiated mind. But when you are addre[s][s]ed by a per[s]on of real merit, who is worthy your e[s]teem, and may ju[s]tly demand your re[s]pect, let him be treated with honor, frankne[s]s, and [s]incerity. It is the part of a prude, to affect a [s]hyne[s]s, reserve, and indifference, foreign to the heart. Innocence and virtue will ri[s]e [s]uperior to [s]uch little arts, and indulge no wi[s]h which needs di[s]gui[s]e. "Still more unworthy are the in[s]idious and deluding wiles of the coquette. How di[s]gu[s]ting mu[s]t this character appear to per[s]ons of sentiment and integrity! how unbecoming the delicacy and dignity of an uncorrupted female! "As you are young and inexperienced, your affections may po[s][s]ibly be involuntarily engaged, where prudence and duty forbid a connexion. Beware, then, how you admit the pa[s][s]ion of love. In young minds, it is of all others the mo[s]t uncontrollable. When fancy takes the reins, it compels its blinded votary to [s]acrifice rea[s]on, di[s]cretion and con[s]cience to its impetuous dictates. But a pa[s][s]ion of this origin tends not to [s]ub[s]tantial and durable happine[s]s. To [s]ecure [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] this, it mu[s]t be quite of another kind, enkindled by e[s]teem, founded on merit, [s]trengthened by congenial di[s]po[s]itions and corre[s]ponding virtues, and terminating in the mo[s]t pure and refined affection. "Never [s]uffer your eyes to be charmed by the mere exterior; nor delude your[s]elves with the notion of unconquerable love. The eye, in this re[s]pect, is often deceptious, and fills the imagination with charms which have no reality. Nip, in the bud, every particular liking, much more all ideas of love, till called forth by unequivocal tokens, as well as profe[s][s]ions of [s]incere regard. Even then, harbour them not without a thorough knowledge of the temper, di[s]po[s]ition, and circumstances of your lover, the advice of your friends; and, above all, the approbation of your parents. Maturely weigh every con[s]ideration for and again[s]t, and deliberately determine with your[s]elves, what will be mo[s]t conducive to your welfare and felicity in life. Let a rational and di[s]creet plan of thinking and acting, regulate your deportment, and render you de[s]erving of the affection you wi[s]h to in[s]ure. This you will find far more conducive to your intere[s]t, than the indulgence of that romantic pa[s][s]ion, which a blind and mi[s]guided fancy paints in [s]uch alluring colours, to the thoughtle[s]s and inexperienced.

Love that ri[s]es into pa[s][s]ion, Soon will end in hate, or [s]trife; But from tender inclination Flow the la[s]ting joys of life." "I by no means undervalue that love which is the noble[s]t principle of the human mind; but wi[s]h only to guard you again[s]t the influence of an ill-placed and ungovernable pa[s][s]ion, which is improperly called by this name. "A union, formed without a refined and generous affection for its ba[s]is, mu[s]t be devoid of tho[s]e tender endearments, reciprocal attentions, and engaging [s]ympathies, which are peculiarly nece[s][s]ary to alleviate the cares, di[s]pel the sorrows, and [s]often the pains of life. The exerci[s]e of that prudence and caution which I have recommended, will lead you to a thorough inve[s]tigation of the character and views of the man by whom you are addre[s][s]ed. "Without good principles, both of religion and morality, (for the latter cannot exi[s]t independent of the former) you cannot [s]afely rely, either upon his fidelity or his affection. Good principles are the foundation of a good life.

"Next to this, an amiable temper is e[s][s]entially requi[s]ite. A proud, a pa[s][s]ionate, a revengeful, a malicious, or a jealous temper, will render your lives uncomfortable, in [s]pite of all the prudence and fortitude you can exert. "Beware, then, left, before marriage, love blind your eyes to tho[s]e defects, to a [s]ight of which, grief and di[s]appointment may awaken you afterwards. You are to con[s]ider marriage as a connexion for life; as the neare[s]t and deare[s]t of all human relations; as involving in it the happiness or mi[s]ery of all your days; and as engaging you in a variety of cares and duties, hitherto unknown. Act, therefore, with deliberation, and re[s]olve with caution: but, when once you have come to a choice, behave with undeviating rectitude and [s]incerity. "Avarice is not commonly a ruling pa[s][s]ion in young per[s]ons of our [s]ex. Yet [s]ome there are, [s]ordid enough to con[s]ider wealth as the chief good, and to [s]acrifice every other object to a [s]plendid appearance. It often happens, that the[s]e are mi[s]erably di[s]appointed in their expectations of happine[s]s. They find, by dear-bought experience, that external pomp is but a wretched [s]ub[s]titute for internal [s]atisfaction. "But I would not have outward circum[s]tances entirely overlooked. A proper regard [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] always be had to a comfortable [s]ub[s]i[s]tence in life. Nor can you be ju[s]tified in [s]uffering a blind pa[s][s]ion, under whatever pretext, to involve you in tho[s]e embarra[s][s]ing di[s]tre[s][s]es of want, which will elude the remedies of love it[s]elf, and prove fatal to the peace and happine[s]s at which you aim. "In this momentous affair, let the advice and opinion of judicious friends have their ju[s]t weight in your minds. Di[s]cover, with candor and frankness, the progre[s]s of your amour, [s]o far as is necessary to enable them to judge aright in the cau[s]e; but never relate the love-tales of your [s]uitor, merely for your own, or any other per[s]on's amu[s]ement. The tender themes, in[s]pired by love, may be plea[s]ing to you; but, to an uninterested per[s]on, mu[s]t be in[s]ipid and di[s]gu[s]ting, in the extreme. "Never boa[s]t of the number, nor of the professions of your admirers. That betrays an un[s]ufferable vanity, and will render you perfectly ridiculous in the e[s]timation of ob[s]ervers. Besides, it is a mo[s]t ungenerous treatment of tho[s]e who may have entertained, and expre[s][s]ed a regard for you. Whatever they have [s]aid upon this [s]ubject, was doubtle[s]s in confidence, and you ought to keep it [s]acred, as a [s]ecret you have no right to divulge.

"Never [s]uffer, with impunity, your ear to be wounded by indelicate expre[s][s]ions, double entendres, and infinuating attempts to [s]educe you from the path of rectitude. True love will not [s]eek to degrade its object, much le[s]s to undermine that virtue which ought to be its ba[s]is and support. Let no prote[s]tations induce you to believe that per[s]on your friend, who would de[s]troy your deare[s]t intere[s]ts, and rob you of innocence and peace.

As a rake is mo[s]t conver[s]ant with the di[s][s]olute and abandoned of both [s]exes, he doubtle[s]s forms his opinion of others by the [s]tandard to which he has been accu[s]tomed, and therefore [s]uppo[s]es all women of the [s]ame de[s]cription. Having been hackneyed in the arts of the ba[s]er [s]ort, he cannot form an idea, that any are in reality [s]uperior to them. This renders him habitually jealous, peevi[s]h, and tyrannical. Even if his vicious inclinations be changed, his having pa[s][s]ed his be[s]t days in vice and folly, renders him a very un[s]uitable companion for a per[s]on of delicacy and resinement. "But whatever inducements [s]ome ladies may have to ri[s]k them[s]elves with tho[s]e who have the reputation of being reformed, it is truly surprising that any [s]hould be [s]o incon[s]iderate as to unite with [s]uch as are [s]till pro[s]e[s][s]ed libertines.

"Lay the foundation of it in youth, and it will not for[s]ake you in advanced age; but furnish you with an adequate [s]ub[s]titute for the transient plea[s]ures which will then de[s]ert you; and prove a [s]ource of rational and re[s]ined delight; a refuge from the di[s]appointments and corroding cares of life, and from the depre[s][s]ions of adver[s]e events. "Remember now your Creator, in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] nor the years draw nigh, when you [s]hall [s]ay, we have no plea[s]ure in them." If you wi[s]h for permanent happine[s]s, cultivate the divine favour as your highe[s]t enjoyment in life, and your [s]afe[s]t retreat when death [s]hall approach you. "That even the young are not exempt from the arre[s]t of this univer[s]al conqueror, the tombstone of Amelia will tell you. Youth, beauty, health and fortune, [s]trewed the path of life with flowers, and left her no wi[s]h ungratified. Love, with its gentle[s]t and pure[s]t flame, animated her heart, and was equally returned by Julius. Their pa[s][s]ion was approved by their parents and friends; the day was fixed, and preparations were making for the celebration of their nuptials. At this period, Amelia was attacked by a violent cold, which, [s]eating on her lungs, baffled the [s]kill of the mo[s]t eminent phy[s]icians, and terminated in a confirmed hectic. She perceived her di[s]order to be incurable, and with inexpressible regret and concern anticipated her approaching di[s][s]olution. She had enjoyed life too highly to think much of death; yet die [s]he mu[s]t! "Oh," [s]aid [s]he, "that I had prepared, while in health and at ea[s]e, for this awful event! Then [s]hould I not be [s]ubjected to the keene[s]t di[s]tre[s]s of mind, in addition to the mo[s]t painful infirmities of body!

Let my companions and acquaintance learn from me the important le[s][s]on of improving their time to the be[s]t of purpo[s]es; of acting at once as becomes mortal and immortal creatures!" "Hear, my dear pupils, the [s]oleman admonition, and be ye al[s]o ready! "Too many, e[s]pecially of the young and gay, [s]eem more anxious to live in plea[s]ure, than to an[s]wer the end of their being by the cultivation of that piety and virtue which will render them good members of [s]ociety, u[s]eful to their friends and a[s][s]ociates, and partakers of that heart-felt [s]atisfaction which re[s]ults from a con[s]cience void of offence both towards God and man. "This, however, is an egregious mi[s]take; for in many [s]ituations, piety and virtue are our only [s]ource of con[s]olation; and in all, they are peculiarly friendly to our happine[s]s. "Do you exult in beauty, and the pride of external charms? Turn your eyes, for a moment, on the mi[s]erable Flirtilla. [1] Like her, your features and complexion may be impaired by disease: and where then will you find a refuge from mortification and di[s]content, if de[s]titute of tho[s]e ennobling endowments which can rai[s]e you [s]uperior to the tran[s]ient graces of a fair form; if unadorned by that [s]ub[s]tantial beauty of mind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] which can not only en[s]ure re[s]pect from tho[s]e around you, but in[s]pire you with re[s]ignation to the divine will, and a patient acquie[s]cence in the mo[s]t painful allotments of a holy Providence? Does wealth await your command, and grandeur with its fa[s]cinating appendages beguile your fleeting moments? Recollect, that riches often make them[s]elves wings and fly away. A [s]ingle in[s]tance of mi[s]management; a con[s]uming fire, with various other misfortunes which no human prudence can fore[s]ee or prevent, may [s]trip you of this dependence; and, unle[s]s you have other grounds of comfort than earth can boa[s]t, reduce you to the mo[s]t in[s]upportable wretchedne[s]s and de[s]pair. Are you [s]urrounded by friends, and happy in the [s]ociety of tho[s]e who are near and dear to you? Soon may they be wre[s]ted from your fond embrace, and con[s]igned to the mansions of the dead! "Whence, then, will you derive [s]upport, if unacquainted with that divine Friend, who will never fail nor for[s]ake you; who is the [s]ame ye[s]terday, to-day, and forever? "Health and youth, my dear girls, are the [s]ea[s]ons for improvement. Now you may lay up a trea[s]ure which neither [s]ickne[s]s nor adver[s]ity can impair. "But the hour of di[s]tre[s]s is not the only time, in which religion will be advantageous to you. Even in pro[s]perity, it will prove the be[s]t [s]olace, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] and the highe[s]t ornament of your lives. What can be more dignified, re[s]pectable, and lovely, than the Chri[s]tian character? The habitual practice of tho[s]e duties which the go[s]pel inculcates will give lu[s]tre to your beauty and durability to your charms. By correcting your passions, it will improve your joys, endear you to your friends and connexions, and render you contented, happy, and u[s]eful in every [s]tage and condition of life. Religion will not deprive you of temporal enjoyments; it will heighten and increa[s]e them. It will not depre[s]s, but exhilarate your [s]pirits. For it con[s]i[s]ts not in a gloomy, mi[s]anthropic temper, declining the [s]ocial and innocent delights of life; but prepares the mind to partake with [s]atisfaction of every plea[s]ure which rea[s]on approves, and which can yield [s]erenity and peace in the review. Be not a[s]hamed then of appearing religious, and of ri[s]ing by that mean above the vain, unthinking crowd. "Let not the idle je[s]ts of heedle[s]s and unprincipled companions deter you from a [s]tedfa[s]t adherence to the path of truth and righteou[s]ne[s]s. "Follow not the multitude to do evil." Never conform to fa[s]hion, even though it claim the patronage of politene[s]s, [s]o far as to countenance irreligion in any of its modifications.

Too many girls are [s]o extremely thoughtle[s]s as to carry the levity of their manners even to the [s]anctuary; and by whi[s]pering, winking, tittering, and other indecent actions, di[s]play their folly to their own di[s]grace, and to the great disgust of all judicious and [s]ober people. Such behaviour is not only offen[s]ive to the Deity, but in[s]ulting to all who would wor[s]hip him free from interruption. It is not only an indignity offered to religion, but a flagrant breach of the rules of good breeding. Content not your[s]elves, therefore, with a bare attendance on the in[s]titutions of religion; but conduct with propriety, decorum, and [s]eriou[s]ne[s]s, while engaged in the [s]olemn service. Bear in mind, that you a[s][s]emble with a profe[s][s]ed purpo[s]e of paying homage to the Supreme; and con[s]ider your[s]elves as in his immediate pre[s]ence! "The offices of devotion demand your attention in private, as well as in public. "Accu[s]tom your[s]elves, therefore, to [s]tated periods of retirement for meditation and prayer; and adopt every other mean which is calculated to keep alive in your minds a due [s]en[s]e of your dependence and obligations, and to inspire you with that uniform love to God and benevolence to the human kind, which will prove your greate[s]t glory here, as well as your crown of rejoicing hereafter."

The tear of grateful regard [s]tole [s]ilently down the bloomy cheeks of [s]ome: others betrayed their [s]en[s]ibility by audible [s]obs, which they could not repre[s]s and all united in te[s]tifying the [s]en[s]e they entertained of the advantages they had received from Mrs. Williams's tuition, the happine[s]s they had enjoyed in each other's [s]ociety, and their determination to remember her coun[s]els, cultivate continued friend[s]hip among them[s]elves, and endeavour to be worthy of her's. Mrs. Williams then took an affectionate leave of each one, and left them with her daughters. The mo[s]t cordial good wi[s]hes were mutually interchanged, till their carriages received and separated them. The friend[s]hip and unity thus commenced and confirmed, were never obliterated. They always cheri[s]hed the mo[s]t [s]incere affection for their Preceptress, and each other; which they di[s]played in an unre[s]erved and [s]ocial corre[s]pondence, both per[s]onal and epi[s]tolary. The re[s]idence of Mrs. Williams they denominated Harmony-Grove , which it ever after retained, and by which it is de[s]ignated in the following [s]election of their letters. [1] See page 52 .

The plea[s]ure which ari[s]es from the recollection of your more than maternal kindne[s]s to me, e[s]pecially your unwearied endeavours to refine and embelli[s]h my mind, and to lay the foundation of right principles and practices, is interwoven with my exi[s]tence; and no time or circum[s]tances can era[s]e my gratitude. I arrived la[s]t evening [s]afely; and was affectionately received by my honored parents, and beloved brothers and [s]i[s]ters. The emotions of regret which I felt in the morning, at the painful [s]eparation from you and my dear [s]chool-mates, with whom I have lived [s]o happily, had not wholly [s]ub[s]ided. I could not help li[s]tening, now and then, for [s]ome judicious ob[s]ervation from my Preceptre[s]s; and frequently ca[s]t my eyes around [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] in [s]earch of [s]ome of the amiable companions, among whom I had been u[s]ed to unbend every thought. The [s]plendor of the apartments gave me ideas of re[s]traint that were painful; and I looked abroad for the green, where we were wont to gambol, and the lawn where we [s]o often held our twilight [s]ports, and almo[s]t fancied that we sometimes caught a glimp[s]e of the attendant Sylphs who played around us; but in vain. Stately domes, crowded [s]treets, rattling carriages, and all the noi[s]e and confu[s]ion of a commercial city were [s]ub[s]tituted. I retired to bed, and was awaked in the night by the riotous mirth of a number of Bachanalians, reeling from the haunts of intemperance and exce[s]s. Alas! [s]aid I, this is not the aeolian harp that u[s]ed to [s]oothe our [s]lumbers at the boarding [s]chool. I compo[s]ed my[s]elf again; but awoke at the accustomed hour of five. I aro[s]e; and, having prai[s]ed my Maker for the pre[s]ervations of the night, walked down. Not a living creature was [s]tirring in the hou[s]e. I took a turn in the garden. Here art [s]eemed to reign [s]o perfectly mi[s]tre[s]s, that I was apprehensive le[s]t I [s]hould injure her charms by viewing them. I accordingly retired to the [s]ummer-hou[s]e, and, having a book in my hand, [s]at down and read till the clock [s]truck [s]even. I then thought it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] mu[s]t be breakfa[s]t time, and returned to the hou[s]e; but was much di[s]appointed to find none of the family up, except one man-[s]ervant and the housemaid, who had ju[s]t crept down. They appeared perfectly a[s]toni[s]hed to [s]ee me come in from abroad; and the girl re[s]pectfully inquired if indi[s]po[s]ition had occa[s]ioned my rising [s]o early. I told her no; that the wi[s]h to pre[s]erve my health had called me up two hours before. Well, rejoined [s]he, you will not find any body to keep you company here, for two hours to come. I was chagrined at the information, and a[s]ked her for a bowl of milk, it being pa[s]t my u[s]ual breakfa[s]t time. The milk man had ju[s]t arrived, and I drank [s]ome; but it had lo[s]t its flavour on the road. It was not like that which was [s]erved us at Harmony-Grove. I [s]tepped to the harp[s]ichord, and having [s]ung and played a morning hymn, returned to my chamber, where, taking my work, I [s]at down by the window to view the li[s]tle[s]s tribe of yawning mortals who were beginning to thicken in the [s]treets. One half of the[s]e appeared to be dragged forth by necessity, rather than any inclination to enjoy the beauties of a fine morning. At nine, I was [s]ummoned into the parlour to breakfa[s]t. My [s]i[s]ters gently chid me for disturbing their repo[s]e with my mu[s]ic. I excu[s]ed myself by alleging that I had been [s]o long [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] accustomed to early ri[s]ing that I [s]hould find it difficult to alter the habit. Here, madam, you have an account of my fir[s]t night and morning's occupation. Were I to proceed with every new occurrence, through the year, and [s]ubjoin my own remarks, I mu[s]t write volumes in[s]tead of letters. Plea[s]e to communicate this [s]croll to your amiable daughters, and remind them of their promise to write. A line from Harmony-Grove would be a luxury to me: Meanwhile, permit me [s]till to [s]ub[s]cribe myself, with the utmo[s]t re[s]pect, your grateful pupil, HARRIOT HENLY. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR MATILDA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] I DID not intend, when we parted at the boarding [s]chool, that a whole month [s]hould have elap[s]ed without bearing you [s]ome te[s]timony of my continued friend[s]hip and affection; but [s]o numerous have been my avocations, and [s]o various my engagements, that I have [s]carcely called a moment my own [s]ince I returned home. Having been from town a year, I was con[s]idered as too antique to appear in company abroad, till I had been perfectly metamorpho[s]ed. Every part of my habit has undergone a complete change, in conformity to the pre[s]ent fa[s]hion. It was with extreme regret that I parted with the neatne[s]s and [s]implicity of my country dre[s]s; which, according to my ideas of mode[s]ty, was more becoming. But, I tru[s]t, this alteration of appearance will have no tendency to alienate tho[s]e [s]entiments from my heart, which I imbibed under the tuition of Mrs. Williams. I went, la[s]t evening, to the a[s][s]embly; but though dazzled, I was by no means charmed, by the glare of finery and tin[s]elled decorations that were di[s]played. There were [s]ome ladies, who[s]e gentility and fa[s]hionable dre[s]s were evidently the product of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] a correct ta[s]te; but others were [s]o di[s]gui[s]ed by tawdry gewgaws, as to di[s]gu[s]t me exceedingly. Mrs. Williams u[s]ed to [s]ay, that the dre[s]s was indicative of the mind. If this ob[s]ervation be ju[s]t, what opinion am I to form of the gay multitudes who trip along the [s]treets, and throng the places of public re[s]ort in this metropolis; the lightne[s]s and gaudine[s]s of who[s]e appearance, be[s]peak a [s]ickly ta[s]te, to [s]ay no more! I am furni[s]hed with feathers, flowers, and ribbons, in profu[s]ion. I [s]hall, however, u[s]e them very [s]paringly; and though I would not be entirely [s]ingular, yet I mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t on consulting my own fancy a little, and cannot willingly [s]acrifice my own opinion to the capricious whims of fa[s]hion, and her devotees. My aunt Laurence, who, you know, is extravagantly genteel, is making us a vi[s]it. She laughs very heartily at my [s]illy notions, as [s]he calls them, and [s]tyles me a novice in the ways of the world; but hopes, notwith[s]tanding, that I [s]hall acquire a better ta[s]te, when I am more acquainted with fashionable life. That I may be much improved by a more exten[s]ive knowledge of the world, I doubt not; yet may I never be corrupted by that levity and folly, which are too prevalent among a part of my [s]ex. I will not, however, cen[s]ure and condemn others; but attend to my[s]elf and be humble. Adieu. LAURA GUILFORD. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove DEAR MATILDA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] The tear of regret for your departure is [s]carcely dried from the cheek of your Maria; and the plea[s]ing remembrance of the happine[s]s I have enjoyed in your [s]ociety is accompanied with a [s]igh, whenever I reflect that it exi[s]ts no more. My mamma has often ob[s]erved, that tho[s]e friend[s]hips which are formed in youth, provided they be well founded, are the mo[s]t [s]incere, lively, and durable. I am [s]ure that the ardency of mine can never abate; my affectionate regards for you can never decay. We have another cla[s]s of boarders; but you and your amiable companions had [s]o entirely engrossed my confidence and e[s]teem, that I [s]hall find it difficult to transfer them, in any degree, to others. The [s]en[s]ations of Anna are very different, though [s]he is capable of the mo[s]t refined friend[s]hip. The natural vivacity, and, as I tell her, the volatility of her di[s]po[s]ition, renders a variety of a[s][s]ociates plea[s]ing to her. In order to recal your ideas to the exerci[s]es of Harmony-Grove, I enclo[s]e the [s]allies of my pen for this morning, fully a[s][s]ured of your candour and genero[s]ity in the peru[s]al.

Balmy plea[s]ures with thee bring; Aromatic gales di[s]pen[s]e, Mi[s]ty vapours bani[s]h hence. Blithe the jocund hinds appear, Joy [s]upports returning care, Mirth the ready hand attends, Plea[s]ing hope the toil befriends.

Here no [s]tormy pa[s][s]ions ri[s]e; Here no feuds impede our joys; Here ambition never roams, Pride or envy never comes.

But I will haunt you with my letters; obtrude my[s]elf upon your remembrance; and extort from you the continuance of your friend[s]hip! What do I [s]ay? Obtrude and extort! Can the[s]e har[s]h words be u[s]ed when I am addre[s][s]ing the generous and faithful Caroline? But you have often encouraged my eccentricities by your [s]mile, and mu[s]t therefore [s]till indulge them. Nature has furni[s]hed me with a gay disposition; and happy is it for me, that a lax education has not [s]trengthened the folly too commonly ari[s]ing from it. Mrs. Williams's in[s]tructions were very seasonably interpo[s]ed to impre[s]s my mind with a [s]en[s]e of virtue and propriety. I tru[s]t they have had the de[s]ired effect; and that they will prove the guardian of my youth, and the directory of maturer age. How often has the dear, good woman taken me into her chamber, and reminded me of indecorums of which I was uncon[s]cious at the time; but thankful afterwards that they had not e[s]caped her judicious eye; as her observations tended to rectify my errors, and render [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] me more cautious and circum[s]pct in future. How [s]alutary is advice like her's; conveyed, not with the dogmatic air of [s]upercilious wi[s]dom; but with the conde[s]cending ea[s]e and [s]oothing kindne[s]s of an affectionate parent, anxiou[s]ly concerned for the be[s]t good of tho[s]e under her care! I was very happy at Harmony-Grove; and the re[s]ult of that happine[s]s, I hope, will accompany me through life. Yet I find the gaiety of the town adapted to my ta[s]te; nor does even Mrs. Williams condemn the enjoyment of its plea[s]ures. I was, la[s]t evening, at a ball; and I a[s][s]ure you, the attention I gained, and the gallantry di[s]played to attract my notice and approbation, were very flattering to my vanity; though I could not forbear inwardly [s]miling at the futile arts of the pretty fellows who exhibited them. Their [s]peeches appeared to have been [s]o long practi[s]ed, that I was on the point of advi[s]ing them to exerci[s]e their genius, if they had any, in the invention of [s]omething new.

JULIA GREENFIELD. -  To Mi[s]s -  Newbury-Port [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] I AM di[s]appointed and di[s]plea[s]ed, Cleora! I have long been anxious to procure the Marchioness de Sevigne's letters, having often heard them mentioned as [s]tandards of ta[s]te and elegance in the epi[s]tolary way. This excited my curio[s]ity, and rai[s]ed my hopes of finding a rich entertainment of wit and [s]entiment. I have peru[s]ed, and peru[s]ed in vain; for they an[s]wer not my ideas of either. They are replete with local circum[s]tances, which, to indifferent readers, are neither amu[s]ing nor intere[s]ting. True, the [s]tyle is ea[s]y and [s]prightly; but they are chiefly compo[s]ed of family matters, [s]uch as relate to her own movements and tho[s]e of her daughter; many of which are of too trifling a nature to be ranked in the cla[s]s of elegant writing. I own my[s]elf, however, not a competent judge of their merit as a whole, even in my own e[s]timation; for I have read the two fir[s]t volumes only. That letters ought to be written with the familiarity of per[s]onal conver[s]ation, I allow; yet many [s]uch conver[s]ations, even between per[s]ons of ta[s]te and refinement, are unworthy the public attention.

He, [s]aid I to my[s]elf, who bears the palm from all contemporary poets, and who is [s]o con[s]ummate a ma[s]ter of this divine art, mu[s]t [s]urely furni[s]h a [s]ource of superior entertainment, when he de[s]cends to friendly and [s]ocial communications. Indeed, there are good [s]entiments and judicious ob[s]ervations, inter[s]per[s]ed in his letters; but the greater part of them have little other merit than what ari[s]es from the [s]tyle. Perhaps you will charge me with arrogance, for pre[s]uming to critici[s]e, much more to condemn, publications which have [s]o long been sanctioned by general approbation. Independent in opinion, I write it without re[s]erve, and cen[s]ure not any one who thinks differently. Give me your [s]entiments with the [s]ame freedom upon the books which you honor with a peru[s]al, and you will oblige your affectionate CAROLINE LITTLETON. -  To Mi[s]s -  Salem DEAR CAROLINE, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] I RECEIVED your's with tho[s]e lively sensations of plea[s]ure which your favours always afford. As I was peru[s]ing it, my papa came into the room. He took it out of my hand, and read it; then returning it with the [s]mile of approbation; I think, [s]aid he, that your corre[s]pondent has played the critic very well. Has [s]he played it justly, Sir? [s]aid I. Why, it is a long time, [s]aid he, [s]ince I read the Marchione[s]s de Sevigne's letters. I am not, therefore, a judge of their merit. But, with regard to Pope, I blame not the [s]ex for retaliating upon him; for he always treated them [s]atirically I believe revenge was no part of my friend's plan, [s]aid I. She is far [s]uperior to [s]o malignant a pa[s][s]ion; though, were [s]he capable of [s]eeking it, it would be in behalf of her [s]ex. Company now coming in, the conver[s]ation [s]hifted. I have often [s]miled at the pitiful wit of tho[s]e [s]atiri[s]ts and e[s][s]ayifts who lavi[s]h abundant eloquence on trifling foibles, the mere whims of a day; and of no con[s]equence to the body natural, moral, or political. The exten[s]ion of a hoop, the contraction of the wai[s]t, or the elevation of the head-dre[s]s, frequently afford matter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] for pages of elaborate di[s]cu[s][s]ion. The[s]e reformers, too, always aim at the good of our [s]ex! I think it a great pity they do not lop off [s]ome of their own exuberant follies; though, perhaps, they wi[s]h us to exchange labours; and, in return for their benevolent exertions, that we endeavour to expo[s]e and correct their errors. I have [s]ometimes thought their [s]atire to be tinctured with malice; and that the cau[s]e of their di[s]affection may generally be found in per[s]onal re[s]entment. Had Pope and his coadjutors been favourites with the ladies, I doubt not but they would have found more excellencies in them than they have ever yet allowed. I have lately been reading the generous and polite Fitzo[s]borne's letters; and I need not tell you how much I was plea[s]ed and charmed with them. The ju[s]tne[s]s of his [s]entiments, and the ea[s]e and elegance of his diction are at once interesting and improving. His letter and ode to his wife on the anniver[s]ary of their marriage, surpass any thing of the kind I have ever read. I verily think, that, had I the offer of a heart capable of dicting [s]uch manly tenderne[s]s of expre[s][s]ion, and [s]uch pathetic energy of generous love, I [s]hould be willing to give my hand in return, and affent to tho[s]e [s]olemn words, "love, honor, and---(I had almo[s]t [s]aid) obey."

Were absurd fa[s]hions adopted only by tho[s]e who[s]e frivolity renders them the dupes of folly, and who[s]e example can have no effect on the con[s]iderate and judicious part of the community, I [s]hould think them below the attention of [s]tate[s]men, philo[s]ophers, and divines: but this is not the ca[s]e. The votaries and the inventors of the mo[s]t fanta[s]tical fa[s]hions are found in the ranks of, what is called, refined and poli[s]hed [s]ociety; from whom we might hope for examples of elegance and propriety, both in dre[s]s and behaviour. By the[s]e, luxury and extravagance are sanctioned. Their influence upon the poorer cla[s]s is increa[s]ed; who, emulous of imitating their superiors, think that the mo[s]t eligible appearance, (however beyond their income, or un[s]uitable to their circum[s]tances and condition in life) which is preferred and countenanced by their wealthier neighbours.

Early I greet the opening year, While friend[s]hip bids the mu[s]e appear, To wi[s]h Matilda ble[s]s'd. The mu[s]e, devoid of [s]elfi[s]h art, Obeys the dictates of a heart, Which warms a friendly brea[s]t.

A [s]plendid wedding, a gay company, an elegant [s]upper, and a magnificent ball, were the [s]um of our entertainment. I imagine [s]uch exhilarating [s]cenes de[s]igned to di[s]pel the anxiety and thoughtfulne[s]s, which every reflecting per[s]on mu[s]t feel on this [s]olemn occa[s]ion. This untried [s]tate pre[s]ents to the apprehensive mind [s]uch a variety of new cares and duties, that cheerfulne[s]s, fe[s]tivity, and hilarity [s]eem nece[s][s]ary to bani[s]h the thought of them, [s]o far as to render a delicate and [s]en[s]ible female [s]ufficiently compo[s]ed to conduct with propriety. But I mu[s]t confe[s]s, that, were I called to the trial, I [s]hould choo[s]e to retire from the observation of tho[s]e indifferent and unfeeling [s]pectators, to whom the blu[s]hing mode[s]ty of a bride is often a pa[s]time. Indeed, Cleora, when we look around the world and ob[s]erve the great number of unhappy marriages, which were contracted with the brightest pro[s]pects, yet, from [s]ome un[s]ore[s]een cau[s]e, have involved the parties in wretchedne[s]s for life, we may well indulge a diffidence of our own [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] abilities to di[s]charge the duties of the [s]tation, and be [s]olicitous that our future companion [s]hould in all re[s]pects be qualified to a[s][s]i[s]t in bearing the burdens of the conjugal [s]tate. Experience only can determine how far we are right in the judgment we form of our[s]elves, and of the per[s]on of our choice. So many are the deceptions which love and court[s]hip impo[s]e upon their votaries, that I believe it very difficult for the parties concerned to judge impartially, or to di[s]cern faults, where they look only for virtues. Hence they are [s]o frequently mi[s]led in their opinions, and find, too late, the errors into which they have been betrayed. When do you come to Bo[s]ton, Cleora? I am impatient for your [s]ociety; becau[s]e your friendship is void of flattery, and your [s]incerity and cheerfulne[s]s are always agreeable and advantageous. Adieu. HARRIOT HENLY. -  To Mi[s]s -  Salem [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] Indeed , Harriot, I open your letters with as much gravity as I would a [s]ermon; you have [s]uch a knack of moralizing upon every event! What mortal el[s]e would feel [s]erious and sentimental at a wedding? Po[s]itively, you [s]hall not come to mine. Your pre[s]ence, I fear, would put [s]uch a re[s]traint upon me, as to render me quite fooli[s]h and awkward in my appearance. However, I mu[s]t acknowledge it a weighty affair; and what you [s]ay has, perhaps, too much truth in it to be je[s]ted with. I believe, therefore, we had better re[s]olve not to ri[s]k the consequences of a wrong choice, or imprudent conduct; but wi[s]ely devote our[s]elves to celibacy. I am [s]ure we [s]hould make a couple of very clever old maids. If you agree to this propo[s]ition, we will begin in [s]ea[s]on to accu[s]tom our[s]elves to the virtues and habits of a [s]ingle life. By observing what is ami[s]s in the conduct of others in the [s]ame [s]tate, and avoiding their errors, I doubt not but we may bring even the title into repute. In this way we [s]hall be u[s]eful to many of our own [s]ex, though I am aware it would be a mo[s]t grievous di[s]pen[s]ation to a couple of the other; but no matter for that. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] The world needs [s]ome [s]uch examples as we might become; and if we can be in[s]trumental of retrieving old-maidi[s]m from the imputation of ill-nature, oddity, and many other mortifying charges, which are now brought again[s]t it, I believe we [s]hall [s]ave many a good girl from an unequal and unhappy marriage. It might have a [s]alutary effect on the other [s]ex too. Finding the ladies independent in [s]entiment, they would be impelled to greater circum[s]pection of conduct to merit their favour. You [s]ee that my benevolence is exten[s]ive. I wi[s]h to become a general reformer. What [s]ay you to my plan, Harriot? If you approve it, di[s]mi[s]s your long train of admirers immediately, and act not the part of a coquette, by retaining them out of pride or vanity. We mu[s]t ri[s]e above [s]uch narrow views, and let the world know that we act from principle, if we mean to do good by our example. I [s]hall continue to receive the addre[s][s]es of this [s]ame Junius, till I hear that you have acceded to my propo[s]al; and then, di[s]play my fortitude by renouncing a connexion which mu[s]t be doubtful as to the i[s][s]ue, and will certainly expo[s]e me to the mortification of being looked at, when I am married.

The [s]un had nearly fini[s]hed his diurnal cour[s]e, and was leaving our hemi[s]phere to illuminate the other with his cheering rays. The [s]prightly [s]ong[s]ters had retired to their bowers, and were di[s]tending their little throats with a tribute of in[s]tinctive gratitude and prai[s]e. The vocal [s]trains re-echoed from tree to tree, and invited me to join the re[s]pon[s]ive notes. My heart expanded with devotion and benevolence. I wi[s]hed the whole human kind to [s]hare the feelings and the happine[s]s which I enjoyed; while the inanimate creation around [s]eemed to partake of my [s]atisfaction! Methought the fields assumed a livelier verdure; and the zephyrs were unu[s]ually officious in wafting the fragrance of aromatic gales. I [s]urveyed the [s]urrounding [s]cenery with rapturous admiration; and my heart glowed with inexpre[s][s]ible delight at the lovely appearance of nature, and the diffu[s]ive bounties of its almighty Author! Let others, [s]aid I, exult in [s]tately domes, and the [s]uperfluities of pomp; immer[s]e them[s]elves [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] in the [s]plendid novelties of fa[s]hion, and a promiscuous crowd of giddy amu[s]ements! I envy them not. Give me a mind to range the [s]ylvan [s]cene, And ta[s]te the ble[s][s]ings of the vernal day; While [s]ocial joys, and friendly, intervene To cha[s]e the gloomy cares of life away. I wi[s]h not to abandon [s]ociety, nor to re[s]ign the plea[s]ures which it affords; but it is a [s]elect number of friends, not a promi[s]cuous crowd, which I pre[s]er. When the mind is much engro[s][s]ed by dissipating plea[s]ures, it is apt to forget it[s]elf, and neglect its own dignity and improvement. It is nece[s][s]ary often to retreat from the noi[s]e and bu[s]tle of the world, and commune with our own hearts. By this mean we [s]hall be the better qualified both to di[s]charge the duties and participate the enjoyments of life. Solitude affords a nearer and more di[s]tinct view of the works of creation; elevates the mind, and purifies its pa[s][s]ions and affections. O Solitude! in thee the boundle[s]s mind Expands it[s]elf, and revels unconfin'd; From thee, each vain, each grov'lling pa[s][s]ion [s]lies And all the virtues of the [s]oul ari[s]e! Adieu.

Yet [s]o great is the novelty which I find in this crowded metropolis, that you cannot wonder if my attention is very much engro[s][s]ed. Mr. and Mrs. Henly, with their amiable daughters, are extremely polite and attentive to me; and have taken every method to contribute to my amu[s]ement. I went, yesterday, in their company, to Commencement at Cambridge; and was very much entertained with the exhibition. I pretend not to be a judge of the talents di[s]played by the young gentlemen who took an active part; or of the proficiency they had made in [s]cience. I have an opinion of my own, notwith[s]tanding; and can tell how far my eye and ear were gratified. I never knew before that dre[s]s was a cla[s][s]ical [s]tudy; which I now conclude it mu[s]t be, or it would not have exerci[s]ed the genius of [s]ome of the principal [s]peakers on this public occa[s]ion! The female garb too, [s]eemed to claim particular attention. The bon ton , ta[s]te, and fa[s]hions of our [s]ex, afforded a [s]ubject of declamation to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] orator and of entertainment to the audience, compo[s]ed, in part, of our legi[s]lators, politicians, and divines! I could not but think that tho[s]e [s]cholars who employ their time in [s]tudying, investigating, and critici[s]ing the ladies' dre[s][s]es, might as well be occupied in the bu[s]ine[s]s of a frizeur or the man-millener; either of which would afford them more frequent opportunities for the di[s]play of their abilities, and render their labours more exten[s]ively u[s]eful to the [s]ex. Others might then improve the time, which they thus frivolou[s]ly engro[s][s]ed on this anniver[s]ary, in contributing to the entertainment of the literati , who doubtle[s]s expect to be gratified by the exertions of genius, and an apparent progre[s]s in tho[s]e [s]tudies, which are de[s]igned to qualify the ri[s]ing youth of America for important [s]tations both in church and [s]tate. The a[s][s]embly was extremely brilliant; the ladies [s]eemed to vie with each other in magnificent decorations. So much loveline[s]s was vi[s]ible in their native charms, that, without any hint from the [s]peakers of the day, I [s]hould have thought it a pity to add tho[s]e foreign ornaments, which rather ob[s]cure than aid them. I was a little di[s]plea[s]ed by the unbecoming levity of [s]ome of my [s]ex; and apprehen[s]ive left it might induce misjudging and cen[s]orious people to imagine that they were led thither more by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] the vanity of attracting notice, than to receive any mental entertainment. Without our con[s]ent, we ran a race back to town, which endangered our necks. The avaricious hackman, de[s]irous of returning for another freight, had no mercy on his pa[s][s]engers or hor[s]es. However, we arrived [s]afely, though much fatigued by the plea[s]ure of the day. Plea[s]ure carried to exce[s]s degenerates into pain. This I actually experienced; and fighed for the tranquil enjoyments of Harmony-Grove, to which I propo[s]e [s]oon to return, and convince you how affectionately I am your's. ANNA WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove DEAR ANNA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] Your enlivening letter re[s]tored us, in [s]ome mea[s]ure, to your [s]ociety; or at lea[s]t alleviated the pain of your ab[s]ence. I am glad you attended Commencement. It was a new [s]cene, and con[s]equently extended your ideas. I think you rather [s]evere on the cla[s][s]ical gentlemen. We [s]imple country-folks mu[s]t not pre[s]ume to arraign their ta[s]te, who[s]e learning and abilities render them con[s]picuous on the literary [s]tage. They, doubtle[s]s, write on [s]ubjects be[s]t adapted to their capacities. As for the follies of fa[s]hion, I think the gentlemen are under obligations to the ladies for adopting them; [s]ince it gives exerci[s]e to their genius and pens. You were tired, you [s]ay, with plea[s]ure. I believe tho[s]e di[s][s]ipating [s]cenes, which greatly exhilarate the [s]pirits, call for the whole attention, and oblige us to exert every power, are always fatiguing. Plea[s]ures of a calmer kind, which are moderately enjoyed, which enliven rather than exhau[s]t, and which yield a [s]erenity of mind on reflection, are the mo[s]t durable, rational, and [s]atisfying. Plea[s]ure is the mo[s]t alluring object which is presented to the view of the young and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] inexperienced. Under various forms it courts our attention; but, while we are [s]till eager in the pur[s]uit, it eludes our gra[s]p. Its fa[s]cinating charms deceive the imagination, and create a bower of bli[s]s in every di[s]tant object. But let us be careful not to [s]ix our affections on any thing which bears this name, unle[s]s it be founded on virtue, and will endure the [s]evere[s]t [s]crutiny of examination. Our honored mamma, and all your friends here, are impatient for your return. They unitedly long to embrace, and bid you welcome to the[s]e [s]eats of [s]implicity and ea[s]e: but none more ardently, than your affectionate [s]i[s]ter, MARIA WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR MATILDA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] Anxious to make the be[s]t po[s][s]ible u[s]e of the education I have received; and fully impressed with the idea, that the human mind is capable of continual improvements, it is my constant endeavour to extract honey from every flower which falls in my way, or, to [s]peak without a figure, to derive advantage from every incident. Pur[s]uant to the advice of our excellent Preceptre[s]s, I keep this perpetually in view; and am therefore di[s]appointed when defeated in the attempt. This afternoon I have been in company with three ladies, celebrated for their beauty and wit. One of them, I think, may ju[s]tly claim the reputation of beauty. To a fini[s]hed form, a fair complexion, and an engaging, animating countenance are added. Yet a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of superior charms was apparent in her deportment; and a [s]upercilious air counteracted the effects of her per[s]onal accompli[s]hments. The two others were evidently more indebted to art than to nature for their appearance. It might ea[s]ily be di[s]covered that paint con[s]tituted all the delicacy of their complexion! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] What a pity, that [s]o many are deceived in their ideas of beauty! Certain it is, that artificial additions [s]erve rather to impair than increa[s]e its power. "Who can paint like nature?" What hand is [s]kilful enough to [s]upply her defects? Do not tho[s]e who attempt it always fail, and render them[s]elves di[s]gu[s]ting? Do they not really injure what they [s]trive to mend; and make it more indifferent than u[s]ual, when. dive[s]ted of its temporary embelli[s]hments? Beauty cannot possibly maintain its [s]way over its mo[s]t ob[s]equious votaries, unle[s]s the manners and the mind unitedly contribute to [s]ecure it. How vain then is this [s]ubterfuge! It may deceive the eye, and gain the flattery of the prattling coxcomb; but accumulated neglect and mortification inevitably await tho[s]e who tru[s]t in the wretched alternative. From their good [s]en[s]e, I had been led to expect the greate[s]t entertainment. I therefore waited impatiently till the fir[s]t compliments were over, and conver[s]ation commenced. But, to my extreme regret, I found it to consist of ludicrous in[s]inuations hackneyed je[s]ts, and [s]atirical remarks upon others of their acquaintance who were ab[s]ent. The pretty fellows of the town were critici[s]ed; and their own adventures in [s]hopping were related with [s]o much minuteness, hilarity, and glee, that I blu[s]hed for the frivolous levity of tho[s]e of my [s]ex, who could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] [s]ub[s]titute buffoonery for wit, and the effu[s]ions of a perverted imagination for that refined and improving conver[s]ation, which a well cultivated mind and a correct ta[s]te are calculated to afford! If, [s]aid I to my[s]elf, this be the beauty and the wit of poli[s]hed [s]ociety, re[s]tore me again to the native [s]implicity and [s]incerity of Harmony-Grove! I took my leave as [s]oon as politene[s]s would allow; and left them to animadvert upon me. Independent for happine[s]s on the prai[s]e or censure of [s]uperficial minds, let me ever be con[s]cious of meriting approbation, and I [s]hall re[s]t contented in the certain pro[s]pect of receiving it. Adieu. SOPHIA MANCHESTER. -  To Mi[s]s -  Beverly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] I SYMPATHIZE with you, my dear Sophia, in the di[s]appointment you received in your expectations from beauty and wit. You may neverthele[s]s derive advantage from it. Your refined and delicate ideas rai[s]e you too far above the [s]cenes of common life. They paint the defects of your inferiors in [s]uch lively colours, that the greater part of the community mu[s]t be di[s]plea[s]ing to you. Few, you [s]hould remember, have had the advantages which you have enjoyed; and [s]till fewer have your penetrating eye, correct ta[s]te, and quick [s]en[s]ibility. Let charity then draw a veil over the foibles of others, and candour induce you to look on the be[s]t and brighte[s]t [s]ide. It is both our duty and intere[s]t to enjoy life, as far as integrity and innocence allow; and, in order to this, we mu[s]t not [s]oar above, but accommodate our[s]elves to its ordinary [s]tate. We cannot [s]tem the torrent of folly and vanity; but we can [s]tep a[s]ide and [s]ee it roll on, without suffering our[s]elves to be borne down by the [s]tream. Empty conver[s]ation mu[s]t be di[s]gu[s]ting to every rational and thinking mind; yet, when it partakes not of malignity, it is harmle[s]s in its effects, as the vapour which floats over the mead in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] a [s]ummer's eve. But, when malice and envy join to give [s]cope to detraction, we ought to avoid their contagion, and decidedly condemn the effu[s]ions of the ill-natured merriment which they in[s]pire. Our [s]ex have been taxed as de[s]amers. I am convinced, however, that they are not exclu[s]ively guilty; yet, for want of more [s]ub[s]tantial matter of conver[s]ation, I fear they too often give occasion for the accu[s]ation! A mind properly cultivated, and [s]tored with u[s]eful knowledge, will despise a pa[s]time which mu[s]t be [s]upported at the expen[s]e of others. Hence only the [s]uperficial and the giddy are reduced to the nece[s][s]ity of filling the time in which they a[s][s]ociate together, with the degrading and injurious [s]ubjects of [s]lander. But I tru[s]t that our improved country-women are ri[s]ing far [s]uperior to this nece[s][s]ity, and are able to convince the world, that the American fair are enlightened, generous, and liberal. The fal[s]e notions of [s]exual di[s]parity, in point of under[s]tanding and capacity, are ju[s]tly exploded; and each branch of [s]ociety is uniting to rai[s]e the virtues and poli[s]h the manners of the whole. I am, &c.

I am much gratified by the perufal and flatter my[s]elf that I [s]hall derive la[s]ting benefit from it. So intricate is the path of youth, and [s]o many temptations lurk around to beguile our feet a[s]tray, that we really need [s]ome [s]kilful pilot to guide us through the delu[s]ive maze. To an attentive and docile mind, publications of this [s]ort may afford much in[s]truction and aid. They ought, therefore, to be carefully collected, and diligently perused. Anxious to make my brother [s]ome acknowledgment for his pre[s]ent, I wrought and [s]ent him a pur[s]e, accompanied with a dedication which I thought might amu[s]e [s]ome of his [s]olitary moments; and which, for that purpo[s]e, I here transcribe and convey to you.

'tis plain that you cannot do wor[s]e! If the end of your being you would ever attain, And honor, pre[s]erment, and influence gain, Go quick to the pocket of [s]ome noble knave, Who[s]e merit is wealth, and his per[s]on its [s]lave: Or enter the man[s]ion, where [s]plendour appears, And pomp and eclat are the habit [s]he wears: Or hie to the court, where [s]o well you are known, So highly e[s]teem'd and [s]o confident grown, That without your a[s][s]i[s]tance and recommendation, None claims any merit, or fills any [s]tation! Seek either of the[s]e; and with joy you'll behold Your[s]elf crown'd with honor, and filled with gold. But to wait on a prie[s]t! How ab[s]urd is the [s]cheme: His reward's in rever[s]ion; the future's his theme. Will the[s]e, for the pre[s]ent, your cravings [s]upply; Or [s]often the din of nece[s][s]ity's cry? Of hunger and want the loud clamours repel; Or cru[s]h the poor moth that would on you revel? For poets and prophets, the world has decreed, On fame and on faith may luxuriou[s]ly feed!

I anticipate, with plea[s]ure, a restoration to your [s]ociety, and that of my other friends there. I [s]hould, however, quit the[s]e rural [s]cenes with reluctance, were it not that they are giving place to the chilling harbingers of approaching winter. They have afforded charms to me, which the giddy round of fa[s]hionable amusements can never equal. Many, however, think life in[s]upportable, except in the bu[s]tle and diffipation of a city. Of this number is the volatile Amelia Parr, whom you know as well as I. So extreme is her gaiety, that the good qualities of her mind are [s]uffered to lie dormant; while the mo[s]t re[s]tle[s]s pa[s][s]ions are indulged without restraint.

Six long months ab[s]ent from the town! What can you find to beguile the tedious hours? Life mu[s]t be a burden to you! How can you employ your[s]elf? Employ, did I [s]ay? Pho! I will not u[s]e [s]o vulgar a term! I meant amu[s]e! Amu[s]ement [s]urely is the prime end of our exi[s]tence! You have no plays, no card-parties, nor a[s][s]emblies that are worth mentioning! Intolerably heavy mu[s]t the lagging wheels of time roll on! How [s]hall I accelerate them for you? A new novel may do [s]omething towards it! I accordingly [s]end you one, imported in the la[s]t [s]hips. Foreign, to be [s]ure; el[s]e it would not be worth attention. They have attained to a far greater degree of refinement in the old world, than we have in the new; and are [s]o perfectly acquainted with the pa[s][s]ions, that there is [s]omething extremely amu[s]ing and intere[s]ting in their plots and counter-plots, operating in various ways, till the dear creatures are jumbled into matrimony in the prettiest manner that can be conceived! We , in this country, are too much in a [s]tate of nature to write good novels yet. An [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] American novel is [s]uch a moral, [s]entimental thing, that it is enough to give any body the vapours to read one. Pray come to town as [s]oon as possible, and not dream away your be[s]t days in obscurity and in[s]ignificance. But this boarding [s]chool; this Harmony-Grove, where you formerly re[s]ided, has given you [s]trange ideas of the world. With what raptures I have heard you relate the dull [s]cenes in which you were concerned there! I am afraid that your di[s]ea[s]ed ta[s]te has now come to a cri[s]is, and you have commenced prude in earne[s]t! But return to your city friends; and we will lend our charitable a[s][s]i[s]tance, in re[s]toring you to gaiety and plea[s]ure. AMELIA PARR. -  Worcester DEAR AMELIA, Your letter---your rattle, rather, came to hand ye[s]terday. I could not avoid [s]miling at your erroneous opinions; and, in my turn, beg leave to expre[s]s my wonder at your entertainments in town. True, we have no plays. We are not obliged by fa[s]hion to [s]it, half [s]uffocated in a crowd, for the greater part of the night, to hear the rantings, and [s]ee the extravagant actions of the bu[s]kin heroes, (and tho[s]e not always [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] con[s]i[s]tent with female mode[s]ty to witne[s]s!) We have no card-parties, avowedly formed for the purpo[s]e of killing time! But we have an agreeable neighbourhood; among which we can easily collect a [s]ocial circle; and per[s]ons of ta[s]te, politene[s]s and information compo[s]e it. Here we enjoy a rational and enlivening conver[s]ation, which is at once refined and improving. We have no a[s][s]emblies, compo[s]ed of a promi[s]cuous crowd of gaudy belles and beaux; many of whom we [s]hould de[s]pi[s]e in a private company, and deem unworthy our notice. But we have genteel balls, the company of which is [s]elect, none being admitted but [s]uch as do honor to them[s]elves and each other. The amu[s]ement is not protracted till the yawning li[s]tle[s][s]ne[s]s of the company proclaims their incapacity for enjoyment; but we retire at a [s]ea[s]onable hour, and add to the plea[s]ure of the evening that of undisturbed re[s]t through the night. Of cour[s]e, we can ri[s]e with the fun, and [s]ip the nectarious dews, wa[s]ted in the aromatic gale. We breakfast before the heat of the day has brought on a languor, and deprived us of appetite; after which, we amu[s]e our[s]elves with our needles, books, or mu[s]ic; recline on the [s]ofa, or ramble in the grove, as fancy or convenience directs. In the [s]hady bower we enjoy either the luxury of [s]olitude, or the plea[s]ures of [s]ociety; while you are, the whole time, in the mid[s]t of hurry [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] and bu[s]tle. Eager in the cha[s]e, you fly from one [s]cene of di[s][s]ipation to another; but the fatigue of this cea[s]ele[s]s round, and the exertion of [s]pirits nece[s][s]ary to [s]upport it, render the objects of pur[s]uit ta[s]tele[s]s and in[s]ipid. Which mode of life, yours or mine, do you now think the mo[s]t rational, and productive of the greate[s]t happine[s]s? The boarding [s]chool, which you affect to de[s]pi[s]e, has, it is true, formed my ta[s]te; and I flatter my[s]elf that I [s]hall never wi[s]h it altered. I [s]hall [s]oon return to town; but not for pleasure. It is not in crowds that I [s]eek it. Adieu. HARRIOT HENLY. -  To Mi[s]s -  Concord DEAR SOPHIA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] Having been with my aunt Burchel for a fortnight pa[s]t, I have indulged my[s]elf in reading novels; with which her library is well [s]upplied. Richard[s]on's works have occupied a large portion of the time. What a [s]urpri[s]ing command has this great ma[s]ter of the pa[s][s]ions over our feelings! It is happy for his own and succeeding ages, that he embarked in the cau[s]e of virtue. For his influence on the affections of his readers is [s]o great, that it mu[s]t have proved very pernicious, had he enli[s]ted on the [s]ide of vice. Though I am not much of a novel reader, yet his pen has operated like magic on my fancy; and [s]o extremely was I intere[s]ted, that I could have dispensed with [s]leep or food for the plea[s]ure I found in reading him. By this circum[s]tance I am more than ever convinced of the great caution which ought to be u[s]ed in peru[s]ing writings of the kind. How [s]ecretly, and how in[s]idiou[s]ly may they undermine the fabric of virtue, by painting vice and folly in the alluring colours, and with the lively [s]tyle of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] this ingenious author. The mind [s]hould be well informed, and the judgment properly matured, before young people indulge them[s]elves in the unre[s]trained peru[s]al of them. The examples of virtue and noble qualities, exhibited by the author I have mentioned, are truly u[s]eful; but every writer of novels is not a Richard[s]on: and what dreadful effects might the [s]pecious manners of a Lovelace have on the inexperienced mind, were they not detected by a ju[s]t exhibition of his vices! The noble conduct of Clementina and Mi[s]s Byron are worthy of imitation; while the indifcretion of Clari[s][s]a, in putting her[s]elf under the protection of a libertine, is a warning to every fair. But both examples are often overlooked. While the ear is charmed with the [s]tyle, and the fancy riots on the luxuriance of de[s]cription, which [s]o intimately blend the charms of virtue and the fa[s]cinations of vice; they are not readily di[s]tingui[s]hed by all. I am not equally plea[s]ed with all Richard[s]on's writings; yet [s]o multifarious are his excellencies, that his faults appear but [s]pecks, which [s]erve as [s]oils to di[s]play his beauties to better advantage. Before I went from home I was engaged in reading a cour[s]e of hi[s]tory; but I fear I [s]hall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] not return from this flowery field to the dry and le[s]s plea[s]ing path of more laborious [s]tudies. This is one di[s]advantage of novel reading. It di[s][s]ipates the ideas, relaxes the mind, and renders it inattentive to the more [s]olid and u[s]eful branches of literature. Adieu. LAURA GUILFORD. -  To Mrs. -  Boston DEAR MADAM, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] Neither change of place nor [s]ituation can alienate my affections from you, or obliterate my grateful remembrance of your kindne[s]s. Your admonitions and coun[s]els have been the guide of my youth. The many advantages which I have already received from them, and the conde[s]cending readine[s]s with which they were always admini[s]tered, embolden me to solicit your direction and advice in a [s]till more important [s]phere. The recommendation of my parents and friends, [s]econded by my own inclination, have induced me to yield my heart and engage my hand to Mr. Sylvanus Farmington, with who[s]e character you are not unacquainted. Next Thur[s]day is the era fixed for our union. O madam, how greatly [s]hall I need a monitor like you! Sen[s]ible of my own imper[s]ections, I look forward with diffidence and apprehen[s]ion, blended with plea[s]ing hopes, to this new and untried [s]tate! Your experienced pen can teach me how to di[s]charge the duties, divide the cares, and enjoy the plea[s]ures, peculiar to the [s]tation on which I am entering.

Practi[s]ing upon [s]uch a model, I may [s]till be worthy the appellation, which it will ever be my ambition to de[s]erve, of your affectionate friend and pupil, HARRIOT HENLY. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] Indeed , my dear Harriot, you are making an important change of [s]ituation; a change interesting to you and your friends; a change which involves, not only your own happine[s]s, but the happine[s]s of the worthy man whom you have cho[s]en, of the family, over which you are to pre[s]ide, and perhaps, too, of that with which you are to be connected. I rejoice to hear that this connexion, on which [s]o much depends, is not ha[s]tily formed; but that it is the re[s]ult of long acquaintance, is founded on merit, and con[s]olidated by e[s]teem. From characters like yours, mutually de[s]erving and excellent, brilliant examples of conjugal virtue and felicity may be expected. Yet as human nature is imperfect, liable to errors, and apt to deviate from the line of rectitude and propriety, a monitorial guide may be expedient and u[s]eful. Your partiality has led you to reque[s]t this boon of me; but diffidence of my own abilities compels me to decline the arduous ta[s]k. Neverthele[s]s, I have it happily in my power to recommend an abler in[s]tructor, who has written profe[s][s]edly upon the [s]ubject. The American Spectator , or Matrimonial Preceptor , lately publi[s]hed by Mr. David We[s]t, of Bo[s]ton, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] contains all you can wi[s]h. The judicious compiler has collected and arranged his materials with admirable [s]kill and addre[s]s. Peru[s]e this book, and you will be at no lo[s]s for coun[s]els to direct, and cautions to guard you through the intricate cares and duties of the connubial life. The e[s][s]ays are, chiefly, extracted from the mo[s]t approved Engli[s]h writers. The productions of [s]o many able pens, properly di[s]po[s]ed, and exhibited in a new and agreeable light, mu[s]t not only be entertaining, but u[s]eful to every reader of ta[s]te and judgment. I wi[s]h this publication to be con[s]idered as a nece[s][s]ary piece of furniture by every hou[s]ekeeper. The editor has certainly de[s]erved well of his country; and Hymen [s]hould crown him with unfading garlands. I [s]hall vi[s]it you, my dear Harriot, after the happy knot (for [s]uch I flatter my[s]elf it will prove) is tied. In the mean time, I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf, with the mo[s]t ardent wi[s]hes for your pro[s]perity and happine[s]s, your [s]incere friend, MARY WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Newbury-Port [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] What think you of wit, Cleora? If you e[s]timate it by the worth of your own, you think it an invaluable jewel. But this jewel is variously [s]et. Yours is in the pure [s]terling gold of good [s]en[s]e: yet, as di[s]played by [s]ome, it gli[s]tens on the mere tin[s]el of gaiety, which will not bear the [s]crutinizing eye of judgment. Ye[s]terday I received a vi[s]it from a young lady, lately moved into this neighbourhood, who is reputed a wit. Her conver[s]ation reminded me of Pope's [s]atirical remark: "There are, whom Heaven has ble[s]s'd with [s]tore of wit; But want as much again to manage it." I found her's to con[s]i[s]t in [s]mart [s]ayings, lively repartees, and ludicrous allu[s]ions. So [s]trong was her propen[s]ity to di[s]play this talent, that [s]he could not re[s]i[s]t any temptation which offered, though it led her to offend again[s]t the rules of politene[s]s and genero[s]ity. As [s]ome per[s]ons of real genius were pre[s]ent, topics of literature and morality were di[s]cu[s][s]ed. Upon the[s]e [s]he was mute as a [s]tatue; but whenever the playfulne[s]s of her fancy could find a [s]ubject, [s]he was extremely loquacious. This induced me to [s]u[s]pect that the brilliance of her imagination [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] had dazzled her under[s]tanding, and rendered her negligent of the more [s]olid and u[s]eful acqui[s]itions of the mind. Is it not often the ca[s]e, that tho[s]e who are di[s]tingui[s]hed by any [s]uperior endowment, whether per[s]onal or mental, are too much elated by the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of their pre-eminence, and think it [s]ufficient to counterbalance every deficiency? This, Mrs. Williams u[s]ed to [s]ay, is owing to the want of [s]elf-knowledge; which, if once possessed, will enable us properly to e[s]timate our own characters, and to a[s]certain with preci[s]ion wherein we are defective, as well as wherein we excel. But it is the misfortune of us , young people, that we [s]eldom attain this valuable science, till we have experienced many of the ills which re[s]ult from the want of it. Ambition, vanity, flattery, or [s]ome [s]uch dazzling meteor, engro[s][s]es our attention, and renders us blind to more important qualifications. But to return to this [s]ame wit, of which I was [s]peaking. It is certainly a very dangerous talent, when imprudently managed. None that we can po[s][s]e[s]s tends [s]o directly to excite enmity, or de[s]troy friend[s]hip. An ill-natured wit is of all characters the mo[s]t univer[s]ally dreaded. People of this de[s]cription are always feared, but rarely loved. Humanity and benevolence are e[s][s]entially nece[s][s]ary to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] render wit agreeable. Accompanied by the[s]e, it cannot fail to plea[s]e and entertain. "Wit, how delicious to man's dainty ta[s]te! 'Tis precious as the vehicle of [s]en[s]e; But as its [s]ub[s]titute, a dire di[s]ea[s]e! Pernicious talent! [s]latter'd by mankind, Yet hated too.--- Sen[s]e is the diamond, weighty, [s]olid, [s]ound: When cut by wit, it ca[s]ts a brighter beam; Yet, wit apart, it is a diamond [s]till. Wit, widow'd of good [s]en[s]e, is wor[s]e than nought; It hoi[s]ts more [s]ail to run again[s]t a rock." But I believe I cannot give a better proof of my own wit, than to conclude this [s]eribble before your patience is quite exhau[s]ted by the perusal. Adieu. CAROLINE LITTLETON. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove DEAR HARRIOT, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] The fir[s]t moment which I have been able to [s]natch from the affectionate embraces of my honored mamma, and my dear [s]i[s]ter Maria, is devoted to you. Judging by the anxious solicitude of my own heart, I know you are impatient to hear of my [s]afe arrival. It is needle[s]s to tell you how cordially I was received. You have witne[s][s]ed the mutual tenderne[s]s which actuates our dome[s]tic circle. Where this is the governing principle, it is peculiarly intere[s]ting to sensibility. It is extremely exhilarating to the mind to revi[s]it, after the [s]horte[s]t ab[s]ence, the place of our nativity and juvenile happine[s]s. "There is [s]omething [s]o [s]educing in that [s]pot, in which we fir[s]t had our exi[s]tence, that nothing but it can plea[s]e. Whatever vici[s][s]itudes we experience in life, however we toil, or where[s]oever we wander, our fatigued wi[s]hes [s]till recur to home for tranquillity. We long to die in that [s]pot which gave us birth, and in that plea[s]ing expectation opiate every calamity." [2] The [s]atisfaction of returning home, however, has not obliterated the plea[s]ure which I enjoyed on my vi[s]it to you. Does not a change of [s]cene [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] and [s]ituation contribute to the happine[s]s of life? The natural love of this variety [s]eems wi[s]ely implanted in the human brea[s]t; for it enables us to accommodate our[s]elves with facility to the different circum[s]tances in which we are placed. I believe that no plea[s]ures make [s]o deep an impression on the memory, as tho[s]e of the fir[s]t and mo[s]t innocent period of our lives. With what apparent delight do per[s]ons, advanced in years, re-trace their puerile feats and diver[s]ions! "The hoary head looks back with a [s]mile of complacency, mixed with regret, on the [s]ea[s]on when health glowed on the cheek, when lively [s]pirits warmed the heart, and when toil [s]trung the nerves with vigour." [3] The plea[s]ures of childhood and youth, when regulated by parental wi[s]dom, and [s]weetened by filial affection and obedience, mu[s]t be grateful to the recollection at any age: and for this plain rea[s]on, becau[s]e innocence and [s]implicity are their leading traits. How [s]oothing, how animating, then, mu[s]t be reflection, at the evening of a life, wholly [s]pent in virtue and rectitude! Pope ob[s]erves that "Every year is a critique on the la[s]t. The man de[s]pi[s]es the boy, the philosopher the man, and the Chri[s]tian all." Happy are tho[s]e who can take a retro[s]pect of all, with the [s]upporting con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s, that each part has been rightly performed! Adieu. ANNA WILLIAMS. [2] Gold[s]mith.

For this purpo[s]e, I mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t on the performance of your promi[s]e to [s]pend the winter in town. It is true that I cannot contribute to your amu[s]ement in kind. Yet, according to the generally received opinion, that variety is nece[s][s]ary to the enjoyment of life, we may find our's mutually heightened by the exchange. Delightful rambles, and hours of contemplative [s]olitude, free from the interruptions of formality and fa[s]hion, I cannot in[s]ure; but you may depend on all that friendship and a[s][s]iduity can [s]ub[s]titute; and while the bleak winds are howling abroad, a cheerful fireside, and a [s]ocial circle, may di[s]pel the gloom of the [s]ea[s]on. The plea[s]ures of our family are very local. Few are [s]ought, in which the understanding and affections can have no [s]hare. For this rea[s]on, a [s]elect, not a promi[s]cuous acquaintance is cultivated. And however unfa[s]hionable our practice may be deemed, we can find entertainment, even in the dull hours of winter, without recour[s]e to cards. Almo[s]t every other [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] recreation affords [s]ome exerci[s]e and improvement to the body or mind, or both; but from this neither can re[s]ult. The whole attention is ab[s]orbed by the game. Rea[s]on lies dormant, and the passions only are awake. However little is depending, the parties are frequently as much agitated by hope and fear, as if their all were at [s]take. It is difficult for the vanqui[s]hed not to feel chagrin; while the victors are gratified at the expense of their friends. But the principal objection with me, is the utter exclu[s]ion of conver[s]ation; a [s]ource of plea[s]ure, and of profit too, for which I can admit nothing as an equivalent. Winter evenings are peculiarly adapted to this rational and refined entertainment. Deprived of that variety of [s]cenery, and tho[s]e beauties of nature, which the vernal and autumnal [s]ea[s]ons exhibit, we are obliged to have recour[s]e to the fire-[s]ide for comfort. Here we have lei[s]ure to collect our [s]cattered ideas, and to improve, by [s]ocial intercour[s]e, and the exertion of our mental powers. Our [s]ex are often rallied on their volubility: and, for my[s]elf, I frankly confe[s]s, that I am [s]o aver[s]e to taciturnity, and [s]o highly prize the advantages of [s]ociety and friend[s]hip, that I had rather plead guilty to the charge than relinquish them.

Good [s]en[s]e will [s]tagnate. Thoughts [s]hut up, want air, And [s]poil, like bales unopen'd to the [s]un. Had thought been all, [s]weet [s]peech had been deny'd; Speech thought's canal! Speech, thought's criterion too. Thought, in the mine, may come forth gold or dro[s]s; When coin'd in word, we know its real worth: If [s]terling, [s]tore it for thy future u[s]e; Twill buy thee benefit, perhaps renown. Thought, too, deliver'd, is the more po[s][s]e[s]s'd; Teaching, we learn; and giving, we retain The births of intellect: when dumb, forgot. Speech ventilates our intellectual fire; Speech burni[s]hes our mental magazine; Brightens for ornament, and whets for u[s]e." Come then, Matilda, participate the plea[s]ures, and accelerate the improvement, of your affec-tionate friend, LAURA GUILFORD. -  To Mi[s]s -  Beverly DEAR LAURA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] Your 's of the 9th ult. has ju[s]t come to hand. It gave me renewed experience of the truth of the ob[s]ervation, that next to the personal pre[s]ence and conver[s]ation, is the epi[s]tolary corre[s]pondence of a friend. I am preparing, with the mo[s]t lively [s]en[s]ations of plea[s]ure, to gratify my own wi[s]hes, and comply with your polite invitation. The romantic beauty of the rural [s]cenes has for[s]aken me; and what can [s]o amply compen[s]ate for their ab[s]ence, as the charms you offer? I envy you nothing which the town affords, but the advantages you derive from the choice of [s]ociety adapted to your own ta[s]te. Your sentiments of the fa[s]hionable diver[s]ion of card-playing, are, in my view, perfectly ju[s]t. I believe that many people join in it, becau[s]e it is the ton , rather than from any other motive. And as [s]uch per[s]ons generally pay the greate[s]t deference to Lord Che[s]terfield's opinions and maxims, I have often wondered how they happened to overlook, or di[s]regard his animadver[s]ions upon this [s]ubject; and have felt a [s]trong inclination to tell them, that this all-accompli[s]hed ma[s]ter of politene[s]s, and oracle of plea[s]ure, expre[s]sly [s]ays, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] "All amu[s]ements, where neither the understanding nor the [s]en[s]es can have the lea[s]t [s]hare, I look upon as frivolous, and the re[s]ources of little minds, who either do not think, or do not love to think." We had a pretty party here, la[s]t evening; and a party it literally was; for it con[s]i[s]ted entirely of ladies. This [s]ingular circum[s]tance was remarked by one of the company, who, at lea[s]t, pretended to think it agreeable, becau[s]e, [s]aid [s]he, we can now [s]peak without re[s]traint, or the fear of critici[s]m. I confe[s]s that I was not prude enough to acquie[s]ce in her opinion. Ladies of delicacy and refinement will not countenance or [s]upport a conver[s]ation, which gentlemen of [s]en[s]e and [s]entiment can di[s]approve. As each were formed for [s]ocial beings, and depend on the other for [s]ocial happine[s]s, I imagine that [s]ociety receives its greate[s]t charm from a mutual interchange of [s]entiment and knowledge. "Both [s]exes are reciprocal in[s]truments of each other's improvement. The rough [s]pirit of the one is tempered by the gentlene[s]s of the other, which has likewi[s]e its obligations to that [s]pirit. Men's [s]entiments contract a milder turn in the company of women, who, on the other hand, find their volatility abated in that of the men. Their different qualities, intermingling, form a happy [s]ymphony. From their intimate conjunction, their real advantages mu[s]t be common and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] in[s]eparable; and as for tho[s]e ridiculous wranglings about [s]uperiority, they may be reckoned in[s]ults to nature, and betray a want of a due [s]en[s]e of its wi[s]e and gracious di[s]pen[s]ations." [4] Many ladies affect to think it incon[s]i[s]tent with female re[s]erve, to acknowledge them[s]elves plea[s]ed with the company of the other [s]ex; but while [s]uch are the objects and advantages of a mixed [s]ociety, I blu[s]h not to own my[s]elf de[s]irous of its cu[s]tivation. Adieu. MATILDA FIELDING. [4] The Ladies' Friend. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR CAROLINE, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] I take the liberty to [s]end you Bennet's Letters. When my mamma put them into my hand, Sophia, [s]aid [s]he, I recommend this book to your attentive peru[s]al. It highly de[s]erves it, and will richly reward your labour. You have, indeed, completed your [s]chool education; but you have much yet to learn. Improvements in knowledge are nece[s][s]arily progre[s][s]ive. The human mind is naturally active and eager in pur[s]uit of information; which we have various and continual means of accumulating: but never will you have a more favourable opportunity for the cultivation of your mind, than you now enjoy. You are now free from tho[s]e dome[s]tic cares and avocations, which may hereafter fall to your lot, and occupy mo[s]t of your time. Speculation mu[s]t then give place to practice. Be affiduous, therefore, to increa[s]e the [s]und, that it may yield you a competent intere[s]t, and afford you a con[s]tant re[s]ource of [s]upport and enjoyment. With the[s]e words [s]he withdrew, while I was [s]till li[s]tening to the [s]weet accents of maternal tenderne[s]s and di[s]cretion, which vibrated on my ear, even after her departure. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] I find it worthy the recommendation of [s]o good a judge. As a moral writer, the precepts and ob[s]ervations of its author are excellent; as a religious one, his piety is exemplary, and his in[s]tructions improving. His [s]election of books, which he deems mo[s]t proper for our [s]ex, though too numerous, perhaps, may, notwith[s]tanding, a[s][s]i[s]t and direct the young, in their cour[s]e of reading. Who would not imitate his Loui[s]a? In her he has forcibly di[s]played the beauties of an amiable di[s]po[s]ition, and the advantages which even that may derive from a virtuous and religious education. The[s]e letters are not [s]chola[s]tic and elaborate di[s][s]ertations; they are addre[s][s]ed to the heart; they are the native language of affection: and they can hardly fail to in[s]til the love of virtue into every mind [s]u[s]ceptible of its charms. If you have not read them, I will venture to predict that they will afford you entertainment, as well as in[s]truction; and if you have , they will bear a [s]econd peru[s]al. Indeed, every valuable book [s]hould be re-peru[s]ed. On a fir[s]t reading, our curio[s]ity to know [s]omething of all it contains, hurries us forward with a rapidity which out-strips both the memory and judgment. When this predominant pa[s][s]ion is gratified, an attentive review will commonly furni[s]h many [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] u[s]eful and important le[s][s]ons, which had nearly or quite e[s]caped our notice before. This, by [s]ome, is deemed too laborious a ta[s]k. They prefer company and conver[s]ation to reading of any kind; and allege, in defence of their opinion, that a knowledge of the world, and of human nature, together with that ea[s]e and gracefulness of manners, which are of the utmo[s]t con[s]equence to all who would make a re[s]pectable figure in life, are much better obtained in this way, than by the cold and unimpa[s][s]ioned peru[s]al of books. But is not every acqui[s]ition of this [s]ort merely [s]uperficial? Need we not a guide, [s]uperior to our own judgment and experience, to point out the line of duty and propriety, in the various conditions and relations of our exi[s]tence? Our acquaintance with living characters and manners can afford us but a very limited view of mankind, in the different periods and [s]tages of [s]ociety. The inqui[s]itive mind labours to extend its knowledge to the mo[s]t di[s]tant climes and remote antiquity; and craves other materials for the exerci[s]e of its reflecting powers, than can be derived from occa[s]ional and de[s]ultory conversation. Now, by what means can this laudable curio[s]ity be [s]o effectually [s]atisfied, as by the perusal of judicious and well cho[s]en books? Not that I would depreciate the value of good company (for I e[s]teem it highly;) but add its many [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] advantages to tho[s]e which reading affords. This combination mu[s]t have a happy tendency to give us po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, both of the virtues and graces; and to render our attainments at once [s]olid and ornamental. What think you, Caroline? Do you agree with me in opinion? Let me hear from you by the fir[s]t opportunity; and believe me your's mo[s]t [s]incerely. SOPHIA MANCHESTER. -  To Mi[s]s -  Newbury-Port [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] I thank you, my dear friend, for the book you were [s]o obliging as to [s]end me; and for the letter which accompanied it. The book I had read; but, as you ju[s]tly ob[s]erve, I mu[s]t be a gainer by a [s]econd peru[s]al. Upon the [s]ubject of reading, I perfectly accord with you in [s]entiment. It is an amusement, of which I was always enthu[s]ia[s]tically fond. Mrs. Williams regulated my ta[s]te; and, by directing and maturing my judgment, taught me to make it a [s]ource of refined and [s]ub[s]tantial plea[s]ure. I do not wi[s]h to pur[s]ue [s]tudy as a profe[s][s]ion, nor to become a learned lady; but I would pay [s]o much attention to it, as to ta[s]te the delights of literature, and be qualified to bear a part in rational and improving conver[s]ation. Indeed, I would trea[s]ure up [s]uch a fund of useful knowledge, as may properly direct my cour[s]e through life, and prove an antidote again[s]t the vexations and di[s]appointments of the world. I think, Sophia, that our [s]ex [s]tand in [s]pecial need of [s]uch a re[s]ource to beguile the [s]olitary hours which a dome[s]tic [s]tation commonly impo[s]es. Is it not for want of this that [s]ome females furni[s]h a pretext for the accu[s]ation (which is illiberally brought again[s]t all) of having recour[s]e to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] scandal, and the [s]allies of indelicate mirth? Conversation requires a perpetual [s]upply of materials from the mind: and, accordingly as the mind has been cultivated or neglected, dignified or degrading [s]ubjects will be introduced. I received a letter, ye[s]terday, from our lively and lovely friend, Anna Williams. How delightfully blended in this charming girl, are vivacity and [s]entiment, ea[s]e and propriety. Adieu. CAROLINE LITTLETON. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] So often, my dear Maria, has the pen of the divine, the morali[s]t, and the noveli[s]t been employed on the [s]ubject of female frailty and seduction; and [s]o pathetically has each de[s]cribed the folly and mi[s]ery of the fatal delu[s]ion which involves many in di[s]grace, that I am a[s]toni[s]hed when I [s]ee tho[s]e, who have the be[s]t means of information, heedle[s]sly [s]acrificing their reputation, peace and happine[s]s, to the [s]pecious arts of the libertine! In this ca[s]e, it is common for our [s]ex to rail again[s]t the other, and endeavour to excite the pity of the world by painting the advantage which has been taken of their credulity and weakne[s]s. But are we not [s]ufficiently appri[s]ed of the enemies we have to encounter? And have we not adequate motives to circum[s]pection and firmne[s]s? I am generally an advocate for my own [s]ex; but when they [s]uffer them[s]elves to fall a prey to [s]educers, their pu[s]illanimity admits no excu[s]e. I am bold to affirm that every woman, by behaving with propriety on all occa[s]ions, may not only resist temptation, but repel the fir[s]t attempts upon her honor and virtue. That levity of deportment, which invites and encourages de[s]igners, ought [s]tudiou[s]ly to be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] avoided. Flattery and vanity are two of the mo[s]t dangerous foes to the [s]ex. A fondne[s]s for admiration in[s]en[s]ibly throws them off their guard, and leads them to li[s]ten and give credit to the pro[s]e[s][s]ions of tho[s]e who lie in wait to deceive. The following remarks, though [s]evere, perhaps, can hardly be deemed incon[s]i[s]tent with the character which their author a[s][s]umes. [5] "Women would do well to forbear their declamations again[s]t the fal[s]ity and wickedne[s]s of men; the fault is theirs, to fall into [s]uch coar[s]e-[s]pun [s]nares as are laid for them. "That [s]ervile ob[s]equiou[s]ne[s]s which women [s]hould immediately look upon as the mark of fraud, and which [s]hould make them apprehend a [s]urpri[s]e, is the very thing which allures them, and renders them [s]oon the victims of perjury and inconstancy; the ju[s]t puni[s]hment of a di[s]po[s]ition which fixes their inclinations on [s]uperficial qualities. It is this di[s]po[s]ition which draws after them a crowd of empty fops, who, if they have any meaning at all, it is only to deceive. Something plea[s]ing in a man's per[s]on, a giddy air, a perpetual levity, [s]upply the place of valuable endowments." A recent, and [s]ingular adventure has rendered ob[s]ervations of this [s]ort peculiarly [s]triking to my mind; which may account for the [s]ubject and the length of this letter. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] I will give you a detail of it, though I mu[s]t conceal the real names of the parties concerned. Ye[s]terday, the weather being very fine, and the [s]leighing excellent, [s]everal of our family, with two or three friends, were induced to make an excur[s]ion a few miles into the country. We [s]topped at a hou[s]e which had formerly been a tavern, and in which we had often been well entertained on [s]imilar occa[s]ions. As we were in ha[s]te to receive the benefit of a good fire, we did not notice the removal of the [s]ign, nor advert to the po[s][s]ibility of its being converted to a private man[s]ion. Being very cold, I [s]tepped fir[s]t out of the [s]leigh, and ran ha[s]tily in; leaving the gentlemen to exerci[s]e their gallantry with the other ladies. The room I entered had no fire. I therefore opened the door which led to the next apartment, when I beheld the beautiful and admired Clarinda [s]itting in an ea[s]y chair, pale and wan, with an infant in her arms! I [s]tood mute and motionle[s]s, till the woman of the hou[s]e appeared to conduct me to another room. Confusion and [s]hame were vi[s]ibly depicted in Clarinda's countenance; and, unable to meet my eye, [s]he threw her handkerchief over her face, and fell back in her chair. I followed the good woman, and, apologizing for my intru[s]ion, told her the cau[s]e. She recollected my having been there before, and readily excu[s]ed my freedom. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] By this time the re[s]t of the company, who had been [s]hown into a decent parlour, were inquiring for me; and I could [s]carcely find opportunity to reque[s]t my conductre[s]s to a[s]k Clarinda's forgivene[s]s in my name, and to a[s][s]ure her of my [s]ilence, before I had joined them. I a[s][s]umed an appearance of cheerfulne[s]s very foreign to the feelings of my heart, and related my mi[s]take without any mention of the melancholy discovery I had made. We prevailed on the woman to accommodate us with tea and coffee, as we wi[s]hed to ride no further. While preparations were making, [s]he came in to lay the table, and as [s]he withdrew gave me a token to follow her; when [s]he informed me that Clarinda had been extremely overcome by my detecting her situation; but being [s]omewhat recovered, de[s]ired a private interview. I accordingly repaired to her apartment, where I found her bathed in tears. Pity operated in my brea[s]t, and with an air of tenderne[s]s I offered her my hand; but [s]he withheld her's, exclaiming in broken accents, O no! I am polluted---I have forfeited your friend[s]hip--- I am unworthy even of your compa[s][s]ion! I begged her to be calm, and promi[s]ed her that [s]he [s]hould [s]uffer no inconvenience from my knowledge of her condition. She thanked me for my a[s][s]urances, and subjoined that, [s]ince [s]he knew the candour and generosity of my di[s]po[s]ition, [s]he would entru[s]t me [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] with every circum[s]tance relative to her [s]hameful fall; when, after a con[s]iderable pau[s]e, [s]he proceeded nearly in the following words. "Though our acquaintance has been for [s]ome time [s]u[s]pended, and though we have lived in different parts of the town, yet common [s]ame has doubtle[s]s informed you that I was addre[s][s]ed by the gay, and to me, too charming Florimel! To the mo[s]t captivating form, he [s]uperadded the winning graces of politene[s]s, and all tho[s]e in[s]inuating arts which imperceptibly engage the female heart. "His flattering attentions, and apparent ardour of affection were to my inexperienced and susceptible mind proofs of his [s]incerity; and the effu[s]ions of the mo[s]t lively pa[s][s]ion were returned with un[s]u[s]pecting confidence. "My father, [s]trict in his principles, and watchful for my real welfare, di[s]approved his [s]uit; alleging that although Florimel was calculated to plea[s]e in the gayer moments of life, he was nevertheless de[s]titute of tho[s]e [s]entiments of religion and virtue, which are e[s][s]entially requi[s]ite to durable felicity. But I could not be per[s]uaded that he lacked any perfection which maturer years would not give him; and therefore finding my attachment unconquerable, my father reluctantly acquie[s]ced in the propo[s]ed connexion. My ill-judged partiality for this ungenerous man ab[s]orbed every other pa[s][s]ion and pur[s]uit; while [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] he took advantage of my yielding fondne[s]s, and a[s][s]umed liberties which I knew to be incon[s]i[s]tent with delicacy, but had not re[s]olution to repel. One encroachment [s]ucceeded another, and every conce[s][s]ion was claimed and granted as a proof of love, till at length he became ab[s]olute ma[s]ter of my will and my per[s]on! Shame and remor[s]e [s]oon rou[s]ed me to a [s]en[s]e of my guilt, and I demanded an immediate performance of his promise of marriage. This, under one pretext or another, he con[s]tantly evaded. His vi[s]its daily became le[s]s frequent, and his attentions le[s]s assiduous; while the mo[s]t poignant angui[s]h of mind deprived me of every comfort. I found my[s]elf reduced to the humiliating alternative of entreating my [s]educer to [s]creen me from infamy by the name of wife, though he [s]hould never con[s]ider or treat me as [s]uch. To this he in[s]ultingly replied, that my [s]ituation mu[s]t nece[s][s]arily detect our illicit commerce; and his pride could never brook the reputation of having a wife who[s]e cha[s]tity had been [s]acrificed. As [s]oon as rage and re[s]entment, which at fir[s]t took from me the power of utterance, would permit, Wretch! exclaimed I, is it not to you the [s]acrifice has been made? Who but you has triumphed over my virtue, and [s]ubjected me to the di[s]grace and wretchedne[s]s I now [s]uffer? Was it not in token of my regard for you that I yielded to your solicitations? And is this the requital I am to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] receive? Ba[s]e, ungrateful man! I de[s]pi[s]e your meanne[s]s! I dete[s]t the ungenerous di[s]po[s]ition you betray, and henceforth reject all intercour[s]e and [s]ociety with you! I will throw my[s]elf on the mercy of my injured parents, and renounce you forever. "Seeing me almo[s]t frantic, he endeavoured to [s]oothe and appea[s]e me. He apologized for the har[s]hne[s]s of his language, and even made professions of unabated affection; but gave as a reason for deferring the conjugal union, at pre[s]ent, that commercial affairs obliged him to [s]ail immediately for Europe; a[s][s]uring me at the [s]ame time that on his return he would not fail to renew and con[s]ummate the connexion. To this I gave no credit, and therefore made no reply. He then reque[s]ted me to accept a pur[s]e to defray my expen[s]es, during his ab[s]ence, which I rejected with di[s]dain; and he departed. The di[s]tre[s]s and de[s]pair of my mind were inexpressible. For [s]ome days, I re[s]igned my[s]elf entirely to the agonizing pangs of grief. My parents imputed my dejection to Florimel's departure, and [s]trove to con[s]ole me. It was not long, however, before my mother di[s]covered the real cau[s]e. In her, re[s]entment gave place to compassion; but the anger of my father could not be appea[s]ed. He ab[s]olutely forbad me his presence for [s]ome time; but my mother at length prevailed on him to [s]ee, and a[s][s]ure me of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] forgiveness and re[s]toration to favour, if I would con[s]ent to renounce and di[s]own my child; to which, not then knowing the force of maternal affection, I readily con[s]ented. This place was privately procured for me, and hither, under pretence of [s]pending a month or two with a friend in the country, I retired. To-morrow my dear babe is to be taken from me! It is to be put to nur[s]e, I know not where! All I am told is, that it [s]hall be well taken care of! Constantly will its moans haunt my imagination, while I am deprived even of the hope of mini[s]tering to its wants; but mu[s]t leave it to execrate the hour which gave it birth, and deprived it of a parent's attention and kindne[s]s. "As [s]oon as po[s][s]ible, I [s]hall return to my father's hou[s]e; and as I am unknown here, and you are the only per[s]on, out of our family, who [s]hares the dreadful [s]ecret, I flatter my[s]elf that my crime may [s]till be concealed from the world. The reproaches of my own mind I can never escape. Con[s]cious guilt will give the a[s]pect of accu[s]ation to every eye that beholds me; and however policy may compel me to wear the ma[s]k of gaiety and ea[s]e, my heart will be wrung with inexpre[s][s]ible angui[s]h by the remembrance of my folly, and always alive to the di[s]tre[s][s]ing [s]en[s]ations of remor[s]e and [s]hame! Oh Julia! you have witne[s][s]ed my di[s]grace! pity and forgive me! Perhaps I once appeared as virtuous [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] and re[s]pectable, as you now do; but how changed! how fallen! how deba[s]ed! Learn from my fate to de[s]pi[s]e the flattery of the worthless coxcomb, and the arts of the abandoned libertine." By this time I was [s]ummoned to tea; when, giving all the con[s]olation in my power to the unhappy Clarinda, I rejoined my company; and to prevent their inqui[s]itivene[s]s about my absence, told them I had been with a [s]ick woman, upon whom I accidentally intruded when I fir[s]t came in; and that [s]he had detained me, all this time, by a recital of her complaints and misfortunes. This account [s]atisfied their curio[s]ity; but the melancholy into which my mind had been thrown was not ea[s]ily di[s][s]ipated; nor could I, without doing violence to my feelings, put on the appearance of my u[s]ual cheerfulne[s]s and ca[s]e. Here, my dear Maria, is a picture of the frailty and weakne[s]s of our [s]ex! How much rea[s]on have we then to "watch and pray that we enter not into temptation!" With affectionate regards to your mamma and [s]i[s]ter, I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf your's mo[s]t [s]incerely, JULIA GREENFIELD. [5] The Ladies' Friend. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Gaovz MY DEAR FRIEND, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] I was much affected by the woe-fraught tale which you gave me in your la[s]t. We cannot too much regret that [s]uch in[s]tances of duplicity and folly are ever exhibited. They are alike di[s]graceful to both [s]exes, and demon[s]trate the deba[s]ing and fatal tendency of the pa[s][s]ions, when [s]uffered to predominate. Your ob[s]ervations upon our [s]ex I believe to be ju[s]t, though many would probably deem them [s]evere. However, I think it not much to the honor of the ma[s]culine character, which the God of nature de[s]igned for a defence and [s]afeguard to female virtue and happine[s]s, to take advantage of the tender affection of the un[s]u[s]pecting and too credulous fair; and, in return for her love and confidence, perfidiou[s]ly to de[s]troy her peace of mind, and deprive her of that reputation, which might have rendered her a u[s]eful and ornamental member of [s]ociety. True, we ought to take warning by [s]uch examples of treachery and deceit; yet, how much more conducive to the honor and happine[s]s of our [s]pecies, were there no occa[s]ion to apprehend [s]uch ungenerous requitals of our [s]incerity and frankne[s]s! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] Ye[s]terday, my mamma took the liberty to read that part of your letter, which contains the [s]tory of Clarinda, to her pupils, and to make [s]uch comments upon it as the [s]ubject [s]ugge[s]ted; during which we could not but ob[s]erve the extreme emotion of one of the miffes, a mo[s]t amiable girl of about [s]ixteen. When the paragraph respecting Clarinda's di[s]owning her child was read, [s]he ha[s]tily ro[s]e, and in broken accents begged leave to withdraw. This was granted, without any inquiry into the cau[s]e; though our curiosity, as you may well [s]uppo[s]e, was much excited. After we were di[s]mi[s][s]ed, my mamma prevailed on her to tell the rea[s]on of her agitation. "I am," [s]aid [s]he, "the illegitimate offspring of parents, whom I am told are people of fortune and fa[s]hion. The fear of di[s]grace overcame the dictates of natural affection, and induced my mother to abandon me in my infancy. She accordingly gave me away, with a large [s]um of money, which [s]he vainly imagined would procure me kind and good treatment. But, unhappily for me, the people to whom I was con[s]igned, availing them[s]elves of their [s]ecurity from in[s]pection and inquiry, abu[s]ed the tru[s]t repo[s]ed in them, and expo[s]ed me to the greate[s]t hard[s]hips. As they were per[s]ons of vulgar minds and unfeeling hearts, they did not commi[s]erate my friendle[s]s condition. My quick [s]en[s]ibility incurred their di[s]plea[s]ure or deri[s]ion. I was often in[s]ultingly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] reproached with the misfortune of my birth; while the tears which the[s]e ungenerous reflections extorted from me, were either mocked or puni[s]hed. I had a thir[s]t for knowledge; but they allowed me no time for acquiring it, alleging that they could not [s]upport me in idlene[s]s, but that I mu[s]t earn my living, as they did their's, by hard labour. Oppre[s][s]ed by the[s]e in[s]ults, I bore the galling yoke of their authority with the utmo[s]t impatience. When [s]creened from observation, my tears [s]lowed without re[s]traint; and the idea of my parents' cruelty, in thus subjecting me to infamy and wretchedne[s]s, continually haunted my imagination. Sometimes I fancied my mother in view, and, expo[s]ing my tattered raiment, expo[s]tulated with her concerning the indignities I [s]uffered, and the unrea[s]onable hardship of leaving me to bear all the puni[s]hment of my guilty birth! At other times I painted to my[s]elf a father, in [s]ome gentleman of plea[s]ing a[s]pect; and fondly indulged the momentary transport of throwing my[s]elf at the feet of one, whom I could call by that venerable and endearing name! Too [s]oon, however, did the rever[s]e of parental tenderne[s]s awake me from my delu[s]ive reveries. "In this manner I lingered away my existence, till I was twelve years old; when going, one day, to the hou[s]e of a gentleman in the neighbourhood, to which I was often [s]ent to [s]ell [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] herbs, and other trifles, I was directed into the parlour, where the mo[s]t beautiful [s]ight in nature opened to my view; while the contra[s]t between my own [s]ituation, and that of children ble[s][s]ed with affectionate parents, gave me the mo[s]t painful [s]en[s]ations. The lady of the hou[s]e was surrounded by her four [s]ons, the elde[s]t of whom was reading le[s][s]ons, which [s]he mo[s]t pathetically inculcated upon all. As the door was open, I [s]tood [s]ome minutes unob[s]erved; and was [s]o delighted with the tender accents in which her instructions were imparted, and the cheerful obedience with which they were received, that I had no di[s]po[s]ition to interrupt them. "At length I was [s]een, and bid to come in. But, when que[s]tioned about my errand, I was [s]o ab[s]orbed in the contemplation of maternal and filial love, exhibited in this happy group, that my tongue refu[s]ed utterance, and I bur[s]t into tears. The children gathered around, and inquired what ailed the poor little girl? But when the lady took me by the hand, and kindly a[s]ked what was the matter, I could not re[s]train or conceal my feelings. When my tears had relieved me, I related the cau[s]e of my grief; de[s]cribing my own [s]ituation, and the effect which its contra[s]t had produced on my mind. "She was affected by my [s]tory, and [s]eemed plea[s]ed with my [s]en[s]ibility; while the children lamented my misfortunes, and artle[s]sly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] requested their mamma to let me come and live with them. "Little did I then expect [s]o great a favour; but to my [s]urpri[s]e, as well as joy, Mrs. ---, the lady of whom I have been [s]peaking, and by whom I am put under your care, came, a few days after, and a[s]ked the people where I lived, if they were willing to part with me. By their con[s]ent [s]he took me home, and has ever [s]ince treated me like a child. "I am now happy beyond expre[s][s]ion. My gratitude to my benefactre[s]s, who, guided by a wife and good Providence, has [s]natched me from ob[s]curity and mi[s]ery, and given me [s]o many advantages for improvement, is unbounded. "But the idea that any helple[s]s innocent [s]hould be unnaturally expo[s]ed to the [s]ufferings which I have experienced, is in[s]upportably di[s]tre[s][s]ing to my imagination. "Let my [s]tory, if po[s][s]ible, be told to Clarinda, that [s]he may be induced to have compa[s][s]ion upon her defencele[s]s offspring." You are at liberty, therefore, my dear Julia, to make what u[s]e you plea[s]e of this letter. I [s]hall make no comments upon the [s]ubject of it, nor add any thing more to its length, but that I am affectionately your's. MARIA WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Salem DEAR ANNA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] My contemplated vi[s]it to Harmony-Grove mu[s]t be deferred. A [s]evere illne[s]s has lately confined my mamma to her chamber. This claimed all my time and attention, and called me to a new [s]cene of care; that of a family, which I was obliged to [s]uperintend during her indi[s]po[s]ition. Her recovery has, at length, re[s]tored tranquillity and joy to our abode; but [s]he has not yet re[s]umed the direction of her hou[s]ehold affairs. To this, [s]he tells me, [s]he is reconciled by the hope, that experience may render me an adept in dome[s]tic economy. Indeed, Anna, I think this an e[s][s]ential branch of female education; and I que[s]tion whether it can be acquired by mere speculation. To me it is plain, that every lady ought to have [s]ome practice in the management of a family, before [s]he takes upon her[s]elf the important tru[s]t. Do not many of the mi[s]takes and infelicities of life ari[s]e from a deficiency in this point? Young ladies of fa[s]hion are not obliged to the ta[s]k, and have too [s]eldom any inclination to perform duties which require [s]o much time and attention; and with which, perhaps, they have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] injudiciously been taught to connect the idea of fervility. Hence it is, that when called to pre[s]ide over families, they commit many errors, during their novitiate, at lea[s]t, which are alike detrimental to their intere[s]t and happine[s]s. How necessary is it, then, to avoid this complication of evils by a [s]ea[s]onable application to tho[s]e offices of hou[s]ewifery, which may one day become our province. Early ri[s]ing, I find a great a[s][s]i[s]tance in my pre[s]ent occupation. It is almo[s]t incredible how much may be gained by a diligent improvement of tho[s]e hours which are but too commonly lo[s]t in [s]leep. I aro[s]e this morning with the dawn. The [s]erenity of the [s]ky and the fragrance of the air invited me abroad. The calmne[s]s which universally prevailed [s]erved to tranquillize my mind, while the receding [s]hades of night, and the ri[s]ing beams of day formed a contra[s]ted a[s][s]emblage of the beautiful, the [s]plendid, the [s]olemn, and the [s]ublime. The [s]ilence which pervaded the surrounding [s]cenery was interrupted only by the melody of the feathered [s]ong[s]ters, who [s]eemed to rejoice in this undi[s]turbed opportunity of praifing their Maker. My heart expanded with gratitude and love to the all-bountiful Author of nature; and [s]o ab[s]orbed was I in the mo[s]t delightful meditations, that I [s]aw with regret the hour approaching which mu[s]t again call me to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] active duties of dome[s]tic and [s]ocial life. The[s]e, however, are objects of real moment, and cannot innocently be di[s]regarded. They give a reli[s]h to amu[s]ement, and even to devotion, which neither the di[s][s]ipated nor the reclu[s]e can know. Adieu. CLEORA PARTRIDGE. -  To Mi[s]s -  Beverly DEAR HARRIOT, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] I SINCERELY thank you for your affectionate letter, by the la[s]t po[s]t, and for the book with which it was accompanied. The very title is [s]ufficient to rou[s]e the feelings and attract the attention of the patriotic mind. Beacon-Hill claims a con[s]picuous place in the hi[s]tory of our country. The [s]ubject of this poem mu[s]t be highly intere[s]ting to every true American; while the genius it di[s]plays cannot fail to gratify every poetical ta[s]te. Philenia's talents ju[s]tly entitle her to a rank among the literary ornaments of Columbia. I have been reviewing Millot's Elements of Ancient and Modern Hi[s]tory; and recommend it to your re-peru[s]al. It is undoubtedly the mo[s]t useful compendium extant. The tedious minuteness and prolix details of [s]ieges and battles, negociations and treaties, which fatigue the reader and oppre[s]s the memory, in mo[s]t works of the kind, are happily avoided in this; while the elegance, [s]implicity, conci[s]ene[s]s and per[s]picuity of the [s]tyle, render it intelligible to every capacity, and plea[s]ing to every ta[s]te. To tho[s]e who have a reli[s]h for hi[s]tory, but want lei[s]ure to give it full [s]cope, Millot is well calculated to afford both [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] information and entertainment. It is an objection, commonly made by our [s]ex to [s]tudies of this nature, that they are dry and elaborate; that they yield little or no exerci[s]e to the more sprightly faculties of the mind; that the attention is confined to an unintere[s]ting and barren detail of facts, while the imagination pants in vain for the flowery wreaths of decoration. This is a plau[s]ible excu[s]e for tho[s]e who read only for amu[s]ement, and are willing to [s]acrifice rea[s]on, and the enlargement of their minds, to the gaudy phantom of a day; but it can never be [s]atisfactory to the per[s]on, who wi[s]hes to combine utility with plea[s]ure, and dignity with relaxation. Hi[s]tory improves the under[s]tanding, and furni[s]hes a knowledge of human nature and human events, which may be u[s]eful, as well as ornamental, through life. "Hi[s]tory," [s]ays the late celebrated Ganganelli, "brings together all ages and all mankind into one point of view. Pre[s]enting a charming land[s]cape to the mental eye, it gives colour to the thoughts, [s]oul to the actions, and life to the dead; and brings them again upon the [s]tage of the world, as if they were again living; but with this difference, that it is not to flatter, but to judge them." The duties and avocations of our [s]ex will not often admit of a clo[s]e and connected cour[s]e of reading. Yet a general knowledge of the mo[s]t nece[s][s]ary [s]ubjects may undoubtedly be gained, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] even in our lei[s]ure hours; provided we be[s]tow them not on works of mere ta[s]te and fancy, but on the peru[s]al of books calculated to enrich the under[s]tanding with durable acqui[s]itions. The [s]incere[s]t wi[s]hes for your health and happiness glow in the brea[s]t of your affectionate MATILDA FIELDING. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston MY DEAR MARIA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] Since I wrote you la[s]t, I have made an agreeable vi[s]it to my good friend, Sylvia Star. After rambling in the fields and gardens till we were fatigued, we went into her brother's library. He was in a [s]tudious attitude, but gave us a polite reception. We are come to [s]olicit a portion of your repa[s]t, Amintor, [s]aid I. Be [s]o kind as to furni[s]h us with [s]ome in[s]tructive page, which combines entertainment and utility; and while it informs the mind, delights the imagination. I am not happy enough to know your ta[s]te respecting books, [s]aid he; and, therefore, may not make a proper [s]election. Here, however, is an author highly [s]poken of by a lady, who has lately added to the number of literary publications; handing me Sterne's Sentimental Journey. I clo[s]ed and returned the book. You have indeed mi[s]taken my ta[s]te, [s]aid I. Wit, blended with indelicacy, never meets my approbation. While the fancy is allured, and the pa[s][s]ions awakened, by this pathetic humouri[s]t, the foundations of virtue are in[s]idiou[s]ly undermined, and mode[s]t dignity insensibly betrayed. Well, [s]aid he, [s]imiling, perhaps you are [s]eriou[s]ly inclined. If [s]o, this volume of [s]ermons may po[s][s]ibly plea[s]e you. Still le[s]s, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] rejoined I. The [s]erious mind mu[s]t turn with disgust from the levity which pervades the[s]e discourses, and from the indecent flow of mirth and humour, which converts even the [s]acred writings, and the mo[s]t [s]olemn [s]ubjects of religion, into frolic and buffoonery. Since [s]uch is your opinion of this celebrated writer, [s]aid he, I will not in[s]ult your feelings by offering you his Tristram Shandy. But here is another wit, famous for his " purity ." Yes, [s]aid I, if ob[s]cene and vulgar ideas, if ill-natured remarks and filthy allusions be purity, Swift undoubtedly bears the palm from all his contemporaries. As far as grammatical correctne[s]s and [s]implicity of language can de[s]erve the epithet, his advocates may enjoy their [s]entiments unmole[s]ted; but, in any other [s]en[s]e of the word, he has certainly no claim to " purity ." I conceive his works, notwith[s]tanding, to be much le[s]s pernicious in their tendency, than tho[s]e of Sterne. They are not [s]o enchanting in their nature, nor [s]o [s]ubtle in their effects. In the one, the noxious in[s]inuations of licentious wit are concealed under the artful blandi[s]hments of [s]ympathetic [s]en[s]ibility; while we at once recoil from the rude affault which is made upon our delicacy, by the roughne[s]s and vulgarity of the other. Choo[s]e then, [s]aid Amintor, for your[s]elf. I availed my[s]elf of his offer, and [s]oon fixed my eyes upon Doctor Belknap's Hi[s]tory of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] New-Hampshire, and American Biography; both of which I have [s]ince read with the greate[s]t satisfaction. By this judicious and impartial hi[s]torian, we are led, from its fir[s]t [s]ettlement, to trace the progre[s]s of the infant colony. We accompany its inhabitants in their enterprizes, their dangers, their toils, and their [s]ucce[s][s]es. We take an interest in their pro[s]perity; and we tremble at the dreadful outrages of the barbarous foe. Our imagination is again recalled to the gradual advance of population and agriculture. We behold the wilderne[s]s blooming as the ro[s]e, and the haunts of [s]avage bea[s]ts, and more [s]avage men, converted into fruitful fields and plea[s]ant habitations. The arts and [s]ciences flouri[s]h; peace and harmony are re[s]tored; and we are a[s]toni[s]hed at the amazing contra[s]t, produced in little more than a [s]ingle century! When we turn to the American Biography, gratitude glows in our bo[s]oms towards tho[s]e intrepid and active adventurers, who traver[s]ed a trackle[s]s ocean, explored an unknown region, and laid the foundation of empire and independence in this we[s]tern hemi[s]phere. The undaunted re[s]olution, and cool, determined wi[s]dom of Columbus, fill us with profound admiration. We are con[s]trained to pay a tribute of ju[s]t applau[s]e to the genero[s]ity of a female mind, exemplified in I[s]abella, who, to [s]urmount every ob[s]tacle, no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] bly con[s]ented to [s]acrifice even her per[s]onal ornaments to the [s]ucce[s]s of this glorious expedition. The daring [s]pirit of Captain Smith, and the prudence, policy, and magnanimity of his conduct to the treacherous natives, and to his equally treacherous and ungrateful countrymen, exhibit an example of patrioti[s]m and moderation, which at once commands our applau[s]e, and interests our feelings. While we tremble and recoil at his dreadful [s]ituation, when bending his neck to receive the murderous [s]troke of death, the native virtues of our [s]ex [s]uddenly reanimate our frame; and, with [s]en[s]ations of rapture, we behold compa[s][s]ion, benevolence, and humanity triumphant even in a [s]avage brea[s]t; and conspicuously di[s]played in the conduct of the amiable, though uncivilized Pocahontas! Nor are the other characters in this work unintere[s]ting: and I am happy to find that the [s]ame ma[s]terly pen is [s]till indu[s]triou[s]ly employed for the public good; [6] and that a [s]econd volume of American Biography is now in the pre[s]s. In reviewing this letter, I am a[s]toni[s]hed at my own pre[s]umption, in undertaking to play the critic. My imagination has out[s]tripped my judgment; but I will arre[s]t its career, and subscribe my[s]elf mo[s]t affectionately your's. SOPHIA MANCHESTER. [6] How vain are our expectations! While the types were [s]etting for this very page, Dr. Belknap [s]uddenly expired in a fit. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR ANNA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] I retired , after breakfa[s]t this morning, determined to indulge my[s]elf in my favourite amu[s]ement, and write you a long letter. I had ju[s]t mended my pen and folded my paper, when I was informed that three ladies waited for me in the parlour. I [s]tepped down and found Lucinda P---, Fulvia F---, and Delia S---. They were gaily dre[s][s]ed, and [s]till more gaily disposed. "We called," [s]aid they, "to invite you, Mi[s]s Maria, to join our party for a [s]hopping tour." Loath to have the ideas di[s][s]ipated, which I had collected in my pericranium, for the purpose of tran[s]mitting to a beloved [s]i[s]ter, I declined accepting their invitation; alleging that I had no occa[s]ion to purcha[s]e any thing to-day; and therefore begged to be excu[s]ed from accompanying them. They laughed at my rea[s]on for not engaging in the expedition. "Buying," [s]aid their principal [s]peaker, "is no con[s]iderable part of our plan, I a[s][s]ure you. Amu[s]ement is what we are after. We frankly acknowledge it a delightful gratification of our vanity, to traver[s]e Cornhill, to receive the ob[s]equious congees, and to call forth the gallantry and activity of the beaux behind the counter; who, you mu[s]t know, are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] extremely alert when we belles appear. The waving of our feathers, and the attractive airs we assume, command the profounde[s]t attention, both of ma[s]ter and apprentices; who, duped by our appearance, [s]uffer le[s]s brilliant cu[s]tomers to wait, or even to depart without notice, till we have tumbled over and refu[s]ed half the goods in the [s]hop. We then bid a very civil adieu; expre[s]s our regret at having given [s]o much trouble; are a[s][s]ured, in return, that it has been rather a pleasure; and leave them their labour for their pains." A mo[s]t in[s]ignificant amu[s]ement this, [s]aid I to my[s]elf I How little can it redound to the honor and happine[s]s of the[s]e unthinking girls, thus to [s]quander their time in folly's giddy maze! They undoubtedly wi[s]h to attract eclat; but they would do well to remember tho[s]e words of the [s]atiri[s]t, which, with the alteration of a [s]ingle term, may be applied to them: " Columbia's daughters, much more fair than nice. Too fond of admiration, lo[s]e their price; Worn in the public eye, give cheap delight To throngs, and tarni[s]h to the [s]ated [s]ight." Viewing their conduct in this light, I withstood their [s]olicitations, though I palliated my refusal in [s]uch a manner as to give no umbrage. Of all expedients to kill time, this appears to me, as I know it will to you, the mo[s]t ridiculous and ab[s]urd. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] What po[s][s]ible [s]atisfaction can re[s]ult from [s]uch a practice? It certainly fatigues the body; and is it any advantage to the mind? Does it enlarge the under[s]tanding, in[s]pire u[s]eful ideas, or furni[s]h a [s]ource of plea[s]ing reflection? True, it may gratify a vitiated imagination, and exhilarate a light and trifling mind. But the[s]e ought to be re[s]trained and regulated by rea[s]on and judgment, rather than indulged. I wi[s]h tho[s]e ladies, who make plea[s]ure the supreme object of their pur[s]uit, and argue in vindication of their conduct, that "Plea[s]ure is good, and they for plea[s]ure made," would confine them[s]elves to that [s]pecies which "Neither blu[s]hes, nor expires." The dome[s]tic virtues, if duly cultivated, might certainly occupy tho[s]e hours, which they are now [s]olicitous to diffipate, both with profit and delight: "But it is time enough to be dome[s]ticated," [s]ay they, "when we are placed at the head of families, and nece[s][s]arily confined to care and labour." Should not the mind, however, be [s]ea[s]onably inured to the [s]phere of life which Providence affigns us? "To guide the pencil, turn th' in[s]tructive page; To lend new flavour to the fruitful year, And heighten nature's dainties; in their race To rear their graces into [s]econd life; To give [s]ociety its highe[s]t ta[s]te; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] Well-ordered home man's be[s]t delight to make; And, by [s]ubmi[s][s]ive wi[s]dom, mode[s]t [s]kill, With every gentle care-cluding art, To rai[s]e the virtues, animate the bli[s]s, And [s]weeten all the toils of human life: This be the female dignity and prai[s]e." A proper attention to the[s]e nece[s][s]ary duties and embelli[s]hments would not only correct this rambling di[s]po[s]ition, but happily leave neither lei[s]ure nor temptation for its indulgence. I intended to have given you [s]ome account of my agreeable vi[s]it here; but the chit-chat of the ladies I have mentioned, has occupied a large portion of my time this morning, and an engagement to dine abroad claims the re[s]t. I hope [s]oon to embrace you in our beloved retirement, and again to enjoy the [s]weets of my native home. "Had I the choice of [s]ublunary good, What could I wi[s]h that I po[s][s]e[s]s not there? Health, lei[s]ure, means t' improve it, friend[s]hip, peace." My mo[s]t dutiful affections await mamma; and my kind regards attend the young ladies re[s]iding with her. How great a [s]hare of my ardent love is at your command need not be renewedly testified by MARIA WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Newbury-Port [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] The extracts which you tran[s]mitted to me in your la[s]t kind letter, my dear Sophia, from your favourite author, Doctor Young, corresponded exactly with the [s]olemnity infu[s]ed into my mind by the funeral of a neighbour, from which I had ju[s]t returned. I agree with you, that the Night-Thoughts are good devotional exerci[s]es. It is impo[s][s]ible to read them with that degree of attention which they merit, without being affected by the important and awful [s]ubjects on which they treat. But Young, after all, is always too ab[s]tru[s]e, and in many in[s]tances, too gloomy for me. The mo[s]t elaborate application is nece[s][s]ary to the comprehen[s]ion of his meaning and de[s]ign; which, when di[s]covered, often tend rather to depre[s]s than to elevate the [s]pirits. Thomp[s]on is much better adapted to my ta[s]te. Sentiment, elegance, per[s]picuity, and [s]ublimity are all combined in his Sea[s]ons. What an inimitable painter! How admirably he describes the infinitely variegated beauties and operations of nature! To the feeling and susceptible heart they are pre[s]ented in the [s]tronge[s]t light. Nor is the energy of his language le[s]s perceivable, when he de[s]cribes the Deity riding [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] on the wings of the wind, and directing the [s]tormy tempe[s]t. "How chang'd the [s]cene! In blazing height of noon, The [s]un, oppre[s]s'd, is plung'd in thicke[s]t gloom; Still horror reigns, a di[s]mal twilight round, Of [s]truggling night and day malignant mix'd. Far to the hot equator crowding fa[s]t, Where, highly rarefy'd, the yielding air Admits their [s]tream, ince[s][s]ant vapours roll, Amazing clouds on clouds continual heap'd; Or whirl'd tempe[s]tuous by the gu[s]ty wind, Or [s]ilent, borne along, heavy and [s]low, With the big [s]tores of [s]treaming oceans charg'd. Meantime, amid the[s]e upper [s]eas, conden[s]'d Around the cold aerial mountain's brow, And by conflicting winds together da[s]h'd, The thunder holds his black tremendous throne. From cloud to cloud the rending lightnings rage; Till, in the furious elemental war Di[s][s]olv'd, the whole precipitated ma[s]s Unbroken floods and torrents pours." Con[s]cious of our own weakne[s]s and dependence, we can hardly fail to adore and to fear that Divine Power, who[s]e agency this imagery exhibits to our minds. Nor are the devout affections of our hearts le[s]s excited, when we behold the [s]ame glorious Being arrayed in love, and accommodating the regular [s]ucce[s][s]ion of [s]ummer and winter, [s]eed-time and harve[s]t to our convenience and comfort. When nature, obedient to his command, revives the vegetable [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] world, and diffu[s]es alacrity and joy throughout the animal, and even rational creation, we involuntarily exclaim with the poet, " Hail, Source of Being! Universal Soul Of heaven and earth! Essential Presence , hail! To Thee I bend the knee; to Thee my thoughts Continual climb; who, with a ma[s]ter hand, Ha[s]t the great whole into perfection touch'd. By Thee the various vegetative tribes, Wrapt in a filmy net, and clad with leaves, Draw the live ether, and imbibe the dew. By Thee , di[s]po[s]'d into congenial [s]oils, Stands each attractive plant, and [s]ucks, and [s]wells The juicy tide; a twining ma[s]s of tubes. At Thy command, the vernal fun awakes The torpid [s]ap, detruded to the root By wintry winds; which now in fluent dance, And lively fermentation, mounting, [s]preads All this innumerous-colour'd [s]cene of things." Aided in our ob[s]ervations by this pathetic and pious writer, our hearts beat re[s]ponfive to the [s]entiments of gratitude, which he indirectly, yet mo[s]t forcibly inculcates in that devout addre[s]s to the Supreme Parent: "---Were every faultering tongue of man, Almighty Father ! [s]ilent in thy prai[s]e, Thy works them[s]elves would rai[s]e a general voice, Even in the depth of [s]olitary woods, By human foot untrod; proclaim thy power, And to the quire cele[s]tial Thee re[s]ound, Th' eternal Cau[s]e, Support, and End of all!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] By this beautiful poem we are allured to the [s]tudy of nature, and to the contemplation of nature's God. Our hearts glow with devotion and love to the [s]overeign Lord and Benefactor of the univer[s]e; and we are drawn, by the innumerable di[s]plays of his goodne[s]s, to the practice of virtue and religion. You may, po[s][s]ibly, call me an enthu[s]ia[s]t. Be it [s]o. Yet I contend for the honor, but especially for the privilege, of being a cheerful one. For I think we di[s]honor our heavenly Father by attaching any thing gloomy or forbidding to his character. In the participation of divine blessings, let us rather exerci[s]e a thankful, and contented di[s]po[s]ition. I remain your's mo[s]t affectionately. CAROLINE LITTLETON. -  To Mrs. -  Boston DEAR MADAM, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 216. ] By her de[s]ire, in conjunction with my own inclination, I inform you that Harriot Henly is no more---Ye[s]terday [s]he gave her hand, and renounced her name together; threw a[s]ide the [s]prightly girl we have been [s]o long accu[s]tomed to admire, and [s]ub[s]tituted in her place the dignified and re[s]pectable head of a family, in Mrs. Farmington. Have I not lo[s]t my amiable friend and associate? Will not her change of [s]ituation tend to le[s][s]en our intercour[s]e, and to alienate our affections? When I contemplate the [s]ocial circle, [s]o firmly cemented in the bands of friend[s]hip, at the boarding [s]chool, where the mo[s]t perfect harmony, ea[s]e and [s]atisfaction pre[s]ided, I recoil at the idea of becoming le[s]s dear, le[s]s intere[s]ting, and le[s]s nece[s][s]ary to each other. It is with the utmo[s]t reluctance that I admit the idea of rivals to that affection and benevolence which we have, [s]o long, and [s]o [s]incerely interchanged. The charm however is broken. Harriot is already married; and my friends are extremely solicitous that I [s]hould follow her example. But in a connexion which requires [s]o many [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] precautions before it is formed, and [s]uch uninterrupted circum[s]pection and prudence afterwards; the great uncertainty of the event in[s]pires me with timidity and apprehen[s]ion. Harriot put into my hands, and I read with plea[s]ure, the book which you recommended to her on the [s]ubject. But [s]till we wi[s]hed for your in[s]truction and advice. The [s]entiments of a per[s]on [s]o dear and intere[s]ting to us, are particularly calculated to engage our attention, and influence our conduct. Relying, too, on your judgment and experience, your forming pen may render us more worthy objects of attachment. We, however, unite in a[s][s]uring you of our gratitude for all pa[s]t favours; and in pre[s]enting our [s]incere regards to the young ladies. I am, with great re[s]pect, your affectionate and grateful LAURA GUILFORD. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove DEAR LAURA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] The obligations under which you lay me, by your generous confidence, and affectionate expre[s][s]ions of regard, induce me again to a[s][s]ume the Preceptre[s]s towards you, and to gratify your wi[s]hes, by imparting my [s]entiments on your present [s]ituation and pro[s]pects. I am told by my daughter, who had the honor of bearing your letter, that you are, what I always expected you would be, an object of general admiration. Yet, I tru[s]t, your good [s]en[s]e will enable you duly to di[s]tingui[s]h and treat the [s]everal candidates for your favour. It is, indeed, my young friend, a matter of the mo[s]t [s]erious con[s]equence, which lies upon your mind, and awakens your anxiety. Your friends are [s]tudious of your welfare, and kindly concerned that the important die on which the happine[s]s of your life depends, [s]hould be judiciou[s]ly ca[s]t. You doubtle[s]s remember, that I di[s]cour[s]ed upon this [s]ubject in my concluding le[s][s]ons to your cla[s]s. Di[s]parity of tempers, among other things which were then [s]ugge[s]ted, and which you will doubtle[s]s recollect, was repre[s]ented, as tending to render life uncomfortable. But there are other disparities which may be equally ho[s]tile to your peace. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] Di[s]parity of years is very apt to occa[s]ion the indulgence of pa[s][s]ions de[s]tructive of conjugal felicity. The great difference between the sprightly fancy, vivacity, and enterprize of youth, and the deliberate caution, phlegmatic coldne[s]s, and [s]ententious wi[s]dom of age, render them very unplea[s]ant companions to each other. Marriage between per[s]ons of the[s]e oppo[s]ite de[s]criptions is commonly the re[s]ult of pecuniary motives, with one party, at lea[s]t: the [s]u[s]picion of this, in the other, mu[s]t nece[s][s]arily produce di[s]content, uneasiness, and di[s]affection. Age is naturally jealous of re[s]pect, and apprehensive of being [s]lighted. The mo[s]t trifling and unmeaning inattentions will therefore be construed ami[s]s. For an exce[s][s]ive de[s]ire of being objects of [s]upreme regard is almo[s]t invariably accompanied with a [s]trong per[s]ua[s]ion of being the rever[s]e. Hence accu[s]ations, reproaches, and re[s]traints, on the one [s]ide, produce di[s]gu[s]t, re[s]entment and alienation on the other, till mutual and uncea[s]ing wretchedne[s]s en[s]ue. Indeed, where intere[s]t alone, without this inequality of years, is the principal inducement, marriage is [s]eldom happy. E[s]teem and love are independent of wealth and its appendages. They are not to be fold or bought. The conjugal relation is [s]o near and interesting; the mind, as well as the per[s]on, is [s]o intimately concerned in it, that [s]omething more [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] [s]ub[s]tantial and engaging than gold is requi[s]ite to make it a ble[s][s]ing. Marriage, being the commencement of a domestic life, be[s]ide the many agreeable circumstances attending it, has its peculiar cares and troubles, which require the [s]olace of a companion actuated by better principles, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of more amiable endowments than outward splendour and magnificence can afford. In the hour of [s]ickne[s]s and di[s]tre[s]s, riches, it is true, can bestow bodily comforts and cordials; but can they be made an equivalent for the tender [s]ympathy, the endearing kindne[s]s, and the alleviating attention of a bo[s]om friend, kindly a[s][s]iduous to ea[s]e our pains, animate our pro[s]pects, and beguile the languid moments which elude all other consolations? The [s]orrows as well as the joys of a family [s]tate, are often [s]uch as none but a bo[s]om friend can participate. The heart mu[s]t be engaged before it can repo[s]e with ea[s]e and confidence. To a lady of [s]en[s]ibility, the confinement of the body, without the con[s]ent and union of according minds, mu[s]t be a [s]tate of inexpre[s][s]ible wretchedness. Another [s]ituation, not le[s]s to be deplored, is a connexion with the immoral and profane. How [s]hocking mu[s]t it be, to hear that [s]acred NAME, which you revere and love, con[s]tantly treated with levity and irreverence! And how painful the nece[s][s]ity of being con[s]trained, for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] [s]ake of peace, to witne[s]s in [s]ilence, and without even the appearance of di[s]approbation, the mo[s]t [s]hameful outrages upon religion and virtue! May you never ta[s]te the bitterne[s]s of this evil! Intemperance is a vice, which one would imagine no lady would overlook in a [s]uitor. But, [s]trange to tell! there are tho[s]e, even among our own [s]ex, who think and [s]peak of inebriation in the other, at the jovial and well-furni[s]hed board, as a mark of conviviality and good fellow[s]hip! What, then, is the di[s]tingui[s]hing badge of humanity? Can that rea[s]on, which alone rai[s]es us [s]uperior to the brute creation, be wantonly sacrificed with impunity; yea, with reputation? How degrading and how dreadful mu[s]t this enormity appear to an intere[s]ted, affectionate, and virtuous wife! What agonizing pangs of mortification and angui[s]h mu[s]t [s]he endure, when [s]he meets him, in who[s]e [s]ociety [s]he delights, who[s]e return [s]he has anticipated with impatience, and who[s]e happine[s]s and honor are the moving [s]prings of her life, intoxicated with wine; the powers of his mind [s]u[s]pended by the poi[s]onous cup, and every faculty ab[s]orbed in the deadly draught! What a perpetual [s]ource of dread and apprehension mu[s]t hence ari[s]e; and how often mu[s]t the blu[s]h of indignant virtue and wounded delicacy be called forth! The game[s]ter is an equally dangerous companion. His family is robbed, not only of his company [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] and his talents, but of that property, to the benefit of which they have an indi[s]putable claim. His earnings are [s]quandered among worthle[s]s and profligate a[s][s]ociates abroad; while the faithful partner of his life, and perhaps, too, a ri[s]ing offspring, langui[s]h at home for want of bread! How fatal is the tendency of [s]uch examples! How can that father inculcate the duties of piety, virtue and decency, who exhibits the rever[s]e of each in his own conduct? And under what an un[s]peakable di[s]advantage mu[s]t that mother labour, in the in[s]truction and education of her children, who[s]e admonitions, coun[s]els, and directions are practically counteracted by him who ought to bear an equal [s]hare of the burden! The government and [s]uperintendence of a family are objects of [s]uch magnitude and importance, that the union and co-operation of its heads are indi[s]pen[s]ably nece[s][s]ary. It is a little commonwealth; and if internal feuds and dissensions ari[s]e, anarchy and confu[s]ion mu[s]t en[s]ue. Dome[s]tic happine[s]s is the foundation of every other [s]pecies. At times, indeed, we may enjoy our[s]elves abroad, among our friends; but a good heart will return home, as to the [s]eat of felicity. " --- Home is the re[s]ort Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where, Supporting and [s]upported, poli[s]h'd friends And dear relations mingle into bli[s]s." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] Since [s]o much, then, depends upon a judicious choice, how important is it, that you examine well before you decide; and that you di[s]pen[s]e with no quality in the man to whom you [s]hall give your hand, which is e[s][s]ential to the virtue and happine[s]s of your life. For this purpo[s]e, con[s]ult your judgment, rather than your fancy; and [s]uffer not [s]uperficial accompli[s]hments, but [s]olid merit to preponderate. I have now endeavoured to point out the mo[s]t apparent and threatening dangers to which you may be expo[s]ed. But though the[s]e are avoided, many unfore[s]een accidents will doubtless occur to cloud your [s]anguine hopes. The[s]e, when there are no vices to produce them, may ari[s]e from follies, and from the indulgence of erroneous expectations. Little mi[s]under[s]tandings [s]ometimes occa[s]ion di[s]agreements which terminate in coldne[s]s and di[s]affection, and plant a root of bitterne[s]s which can hardly be eradicated. Let prudence, therefore, be your pole-[s]tar, when you enter the married [s]tate. Watch with the greate[s]t circum[s]pection over your[s]elf; and always exerci[s]e the tendere[s]t affection, the mo[s]t unwearied patience, and the mo[s]t cheerful acquiescence in the treatment of your companion. Guard e[s]pecially again[s]t being affected by tho[s]e little inattentions and foibles, which too often give pain and umbrage without de[s]ign; and produce tho[s]e remon[s]trances, criminations, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] retorts, which are the great inlets of [s]trife, and bane of love. You mu[s]t bear, with calmne[s]s, every thing that the [s]incere[s]t de[s]ire of peace can dictate; and studiously avoid every expre[s][s]ion, and even look, which may irritate and offend. Your own happiness, you will con[s]ider [s]o intimately connected with that of your hu[s]band, as to be in[s]eparable; and con[s]equently, that all your hopes of comfort in this life, and perhaps, too, in the next, depend upon your conducting with propriety and wisdom towards him. I take the liberty, through you, to convey my congratulations to Mrs. Farmington. May her change of condition be happy, to the full extent of our mo[s]t [s]anguine expectations, and benevolent wi[s]hes. I fully intended writing her on the [s]ubject, but have unwarily be[s]towed [s]o much time upon you, that for the pre[s]ent, I mu[s]t fore-go the plea[s]ure. Some things in this letter, which you will doubtle[s]s communicate, are applicable to her ca[s]e. The[s]e [s]he will receive as friendly hints from me; and I am confident that her known di[s]cretion will continue to [s]hed a benign and engaging influence upon her whole deportment, and render her uniformly re[s]pected and beloved. The bearer is waiting, and I can only add, that I remain your [s]incere and affectionate friend. MARY WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR CLEORA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-230.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] The plea[s]ing hope with which you inspired me, when we parted la[s]t, of receiving a vi[s]it from you in town, has been con[s]tantly cheri[s]hed. I have anticipated your arrival with the utmo[s]t impatience; but have endeavoured, notwith[s]tanding, to beguile the [s]low-paced hours by a u[s]eful and plea[s]ing occupation; the revision of my geographical [s]tudies. My papa has kindly procured me Doctor Mor[s]e's la[s]t, and much improved edition of Universal Geography, which, with the a[s][s]i[s]tance of a pair of globes he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, has afforded me the mo[s]t delightful entertainment. When at [s]chool, I thought this the mo[s]t agreeable [s]tudy allotted me; never deeming it a ta[s]k, but an amu[s]ement. It affords me, as it mu[s]t every true American, the [s]incere[s]t plea[s]ure to be furni[s]hed with the means of acquiring this favourite [s]cience, by my own countryman; and the [s]pirit of Columbian independence exults in my bo[s]om, at the idea of being able to gain an accurate acquaintance with my own and other countries, without recour[s]e to the labours of foreigners. I think the pre[s]ent generation under [s]pecial obligations to the active indu[s]try of Dr. Mor[s]e, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-231.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] in providing us with that nece[s][s]ary and rich fund of information, which his Geography and Gazetteer contain. From the[s]e [s]ources we may derive a [s]ufficient knowledge of the world we inhabit, without departing from our dome[s]tic [s]phere. Come, then, my dear Cleora, and without fatigue or expen[s]e, we will make the tour of the globe together. After inve[s]tigating the local situation of different and di[s]tant climes, we will turn to the hi[s]toric page, and examine the manners, government, character, and improvements of their inhabitants. We will traver[s]e the frozen wa[s]tes of the frigid zones, and the burning [s]ands of the equatorial region; then return and ble[s]s the temperate and happy medium in which we are placed; and, ca[s]ting an eye around, exult in our peculiar advantages of [s]oil and [s]ituation, peace and good government, virtue and religion. The fine mornings of this [s]ea[s]on afford many delightful hours, before the heat of the day relaxes the mind and enervates the body. Come, then, enjoy and improve the[s]e, in concert with your faithful and affectionate friend, JULIA GREENFIELD. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove DEAR MATILDA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-232.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] Last Thur[s]day, after having concluded the u[s]ual occupations and [s]edentary amu[s]ements of the day, I walked out, towards evening, to enjoy the benefit of a cool and fragrant air, and the [s]erenity and beauty of tho[s]e rural [s]cenes which have a powerful tendency to [s]oothe and tranquillize the mind. When I had rambled in the fields, to a con[s]iderable di[s]tance, I cro[s][s]ed into the road, to return home free from the inconvenience of the dew, which had begun to fall. I had not proceeded far, when I ob[s]erved a female, who had the appearance of youth and misfortune, [s]itting by the wall in a pen[s]ive attitude, with an infant in her lap. When I approached her, [s]he aro[s]e, and in the mo[s]t humble and pathetic accents, be[s]ought me to direct her to [s]ome [s]helter, where [s]he might repo[s]e her weary limbs for the night. The a[s]pect and language of di[s]tre[s]s awakened my compa[s][s]ion. To know [s]he really needed charity, was a [s]ufficient inducement with me to be[s]tow it, without scrupulously inquiring whether [s]he de[s]erved it or not. I therefore told her to follow me, and I would conduct her to a lodging. As we walked on, I que[s]tioned her re[s]pecting the place of her nativity, her parentage, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-233.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] rea[s]on of her being reduced to the [s]ituation in which I had found her. She informed me that [s]he was born in Ireland; that her parents brought her into this country, before her remembrance; that while [s]he was very young, they both died, and left her to the protection and mercy of [s]trangers; that [s]he was bandied from one to another, in the village where Providence had ca[s]t her lot, till [s]he was able to earn her own living: "and [s]ince that time," [s]aid [s]he, "I believe the character of an hone[s]t and industrious girl will not be refu[s]ed me." How then, [s]aid I, came you by this incumbrance? pointing to the child. "In that," replied [s]he, "I am verily guilty. Brought up in ignorance of tho[s]e principles of decency, virtue and religion, which have kept you innocent, Madam, I was ruined by a deceitful man, who, under the ma[s]k of love, and with the mo[s]t [s]olemn promi[s]es of marriage, betrayed my confidence, and left me to reap the bitter fruits of my credulity. The woman where I lived, when [s]he di[s]covered my [s]ituation, ordered me to leave her hou[s]e immediately. It was no matter, [s]aid [s]he, how much I [s]uffered, or what became of me. On my own head, [s]he told me, my iniquity [s]hould fall; [s]he would not lighten the burden, if it were in her power. "Some of the neighbours informed me, that [s]he had rea[s]on to be [s]evere upon my fault, being once in the [s]ame condemnation her[s]elf. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] "Having no friend who could a[s][s]i[s]t me, I applied to the [s]election of the town, who provided for me till I was able to work, and then told me I mu[s]t [s]hift for my[s]elf; offering, however, to keep the child, which I refu[s]ed, being determined it [s]hould never [s]uffer for want of a mother's care, while I had life. "I am now wandering in pur[s]uit of employment, that the labour of my hands may [s]upport my[s]elf and little one. This has been often denied me, either for fear my child [s]hould be trouble[s]ome, or becau[s]e my character was suspected. I have [s]ometimes [s]uffered [s]o much from fatigue and want, that I have de[s]paired of relief, and heartily wi[s]hed both my[s]elf and my babe in the grave." On examination, I found her knowledge confined entirely to dome[s]tic drudgery; that [s]he had never been taught either to read or write. She appears, notwith[s]tanding, to have good natural [s]en[s]e; and a quickne[s]s of apprehen[s]ion, and readine[s]s of expre[s][s]ion, [s]eldom equalled in her [s]phere of life. I conducted her into the kitchen, and de[s]ired [s]he might have [s]upper, and a bed provided for her. My mamma, who[s]e benevolent heart and liberal hand are always ready to relieve the necessitous, was plea[s]ed to approve my conduct; and having kept her through the next day, and observed her di[s]po[s]ition and behaviour, hired her as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] a [s]ervant; and we have rea[s]on to believe, from her apparent fidelity and grateful exertions, that our kindne[s]s will be well repaid. I have even extended my charity further, and undertaken to teach her to read. She is very tractable; and I expect to be amply rewarded for my labour, by her improvements. Indeed, Matilda, it is melancholy to [s]ee our fellow-creatures reared up, like the brute creation; neither in[s]tructed how to live above their animal appetites, nor how to die as Chri[s]tians, when they have fini[s]hed their toil[s]ome career! This girl is only [s]eventeen. Her age, therefore, as well as her docility and [s]ubmi[s][s]ivene[s]s, encourage the plea[s]ing hope of re[s]toring her to the paths of rectitude and peace. I [s]hall endeavour, as opportunity offers, to in[s]til into her [s]u[s]ceptible mind, the principles of virtue and religion; and, perhaps, I may lead her to the love and practice of both, and render her a u[s]eful member of [s]ociety. Her fate impre[s][s]es, more forcibly than ever, on my mind, the importance of a good education, and the obligations it confers. Had you or I been [s]ubjected to the [s]ame ignorance, and the [s]ame temptations, who can [s]ay that we [s]hould have conducted better? How many fall for want of the directing hand of that parental love and friend[s]hip, with which we are ble[s][s]ed! Contra[s]ting our [s]ituation with her's, how much have we to account for, and how [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] inexcusable [s]hall we be, if we violate our duty, and forfeit our dignity, as rea[s]onable creatures! That extreme bitterne[s]s and acrimony, which is [s]ometimes indulged, again[s]t per[s]ons who are unhappily [s]educed from the way of virtue, may operate as a di[s]couragement to all de[s]igns and endeavours to regain it: whereas, the [s]oothing voice of forgivene[s]s, and the con[s]equent pro[s]pect of being re[s]tored to reputation and u[s]efulne[s]s, might rou[s]e the attention, and call forth the exertions of [s]ome, at lea[s]t, who, through de[s]pair of retrieving their characters, abandon them[s]elves to vice, and adopt a cour[s]e, alike di[s]graceful to their [s]ex, and to human nature. But, though I advocate the principles of philanthropy and Chri[s]tian charity, as extending to [s]ome very [s]pecial ca[s]es, I am far from [s]uppo[s]ing this fault generally capable of the lea[s]t extenuation. Whatever allowance may be made for tho[s]e, who[s]e ignorance occa[s]ions their ruin, no excu[s]e can be offered for others, who[s]e education, and opportunities for knowing the world and them[s]elves, have taught them a better le[s][s]on. I need not, however, be at the pains to enforce this truth upon you: and, as my head is [s]o full of the [s]ubject, that I have no di[s]po[s]ition to write upon any thing el[s]e, I will put an end to this incoherent [s]croll, by annexing the name of your [s]incere and faithful friend, MARIA WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR CAROLINE, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] Happening to be in my chamber, this morning, the maid came running up [s]tairs in [s]uch violent ha[s]te, as to put her[s]elf fairly out of breath. Will you be [s]o kind, Mi[s]s Sophia, [s]aid [s]he, as to lend me a quarter of a dollar? I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had no [s]mall change. I have nothing le[s]s than a dollar, Su[s]an, [s]aid I; but, if it is a matter of con[s]equence to you, I will go to my mamma, and procure it for you. She was loath to give me that trouble; but, if I would, it would really oblige her very much indeed. Her [s]olicitude excited my curio[s]ity. Will you inform me what you want it for? [s]aid I. O yes; [s]he believed it was no harm---But there was a woman in the wood-hou[s]e, who told fortunes; and [s]he wi[s]hed to know her's, but could not without the money. A woman who tells fortunes! [s]aid I. What fortunes? the pa[s]t, or the future? The future, to be [s]ure, Ma'am, rejoined [s]he. Ay, how does [s]he know them? [s]aid I. Has [s]he been let into the [s]ecret de[s]igns of Providence? or can [s]he divine the my[s]teries of fate? She tells fortunes by cards, Ma'am, [s]aid [s]he; and I really believe [s]he tells true. Can you imagine, [s]aid I, that a knowledge of your de[s]tiny in life, is to be gained from any po[s][s]ible [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] arrangement of a pack of cards? Why not, Ma'am? Many people have been told exactly what was to happen. You may depend on it, Su[s]an, [s]aid I, you are deceived. The Almighty, who di[s]po[s]es all events according to his [s]overeign plea[s]ure, does not unveil futurity to mortals, e[s]pecially to [s]uch mortals, who, by an idle vicious cour[s]e of life, counteract his laws, and di[s]regard his authority. I would willingly give you the money, twice told, if you needed it; but I cannot consent to your being impo[s]ed on, by this worthle[s]s vagrant, who has no other de[s]ign than to pick your pocket. The girl departed at the[s]e words; and, though I felt an emotion of regret at refu[s]ing to gratify her, yet my rea[s]on and con[s]cience forbad my being acce[s][s]ary to the fraud. This curio[s]ity to explore the hidden coun[s]els of the Mo[s]t High, prevails not only among [s]ervants, but even many, from whom better things might be expected, are under its infatuating influence. The Supreme Being has, for wi[s]e and benevolent rea[s]ons, concealed from us the future incidents of our lives. A humble reliance on his power and goodne[s]s, accompanied with a cheerful [s]ubmi[s][s]ion to the di[s]pen[s]ations of his providence, is what the Lord our God requireth of us. I have heard my mamma relate an anecdote of a particular friend of her's, who was impo[s]ed on very [s]eriou[s]ly in this way. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] A gentleman, whom I [s]hall call Sylvander, was very deeply in love with her; but his per[s]on, and, much more, his di[s]po[s]ition and manners, were extremely difgu[s]ting to her. Aver[s]e to the very idea of a connexion with him, [s]he accordingly refu[s]ed his addre[s][s]es. Yet he had art fussicient to intere[s]t her friends in his behalf; who, pitying his [s]ituation, endeavoured to [s]often the heart of the obdurate fair. But in vain they [s]trove to conciliate her affections. In defiance of all oppo[s]ition, however, he incessantly obtruded his vi[s]its, till [s]he reluctantly admitted them; and being [s]omewhat coquetti[s]h, [s]he at times received him more benignly; which flattered his hopes of ultimately accompli[s]hing his wi[s]hes. Finding his ardent [s]uit of but little avail, and perceiving that he made but [s]mall progre[s]s towards gaining her favour, he had recourse to art. Surpri[s]ing her, one day, in clo[s]e confabulation with a fortune-teller, the idea immediately [s]truck him, that he might effect, through this mean, what all his a[s][s]iduity and [s]olicitations could never in[s]ure. He communicated his plan to a female friend, who was equally the confident of both parties. Directed by him, [s]he converfed with Sylvia on the [s]ubject; profe[s][s]ed her belief in the [s]kill of the[s]e jugglers; and appeared de[s]irous of taking this mea[s]ure to learn her fate. Sylvia joined in her opinion and wi[s]hes; and away they tripped together on the important [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] errand. Meanwhile, Sylvander had been to the fellow who was to reveal their de[s]tinies; and, bribing him to favour the de[s]ign, left him, instructed what an[s]wers to make to their interrogations. They arrived, and propo[s]ed their bu[s]ine[s]s. The mediums of information, a pack of cards, were brought forth, and my[s]tcriou[s]ly arranged. Sylvia's curio[s]ity was on tip-toe. She li[s]tened with profound attention to his oracular wi[s]dom; and believed him really in[s]pired, when he told her, that her former lover, for whom [s]he had a great regard, was gone to a foreign country. This [s]he knew to be true, and therefore gave him full credence, when he added, that he would never live to return; and when he proceeded [s]till further to ob[s]erve, that another gentleman of great merit now courted her; that [s]he was not fond of his addre[s][s]es, but would [s]oon [s]ee his worth and her own error; give him her hand, and be happy. In [s]hort, he [s]o artfully blended the pa[s]t and pre[s]ent, which [s]he knew, with the future which Sylvander wi[s]hed, and had therefore dictated, that [s]he was firmly per[s]uaded he dealt with [s]ome invi[s]ible power, and that fate had, indeed, predestined her to the arms of Sylvander. Convinced of this, [s]he attended to his overtures more placidly, contemplated his per[s]on and endowments with le[s]s aver[s]ion, and endeavoured to reconcile her[s]elf to the unavoidable event. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] This [s]he effected; and not long after, he obtained her in marriage, and triumphed in the [s]ucce[s]s of his duplicity. In proce[s]s of time, her other lover returned. Di[s]appointment and de[s]pair pre[s]ided in his brea[s]t. He [s]aw Sylvia, upbraided her with her incon[s]tancy, and declared him[s]elf utterly ruined. Pity and returning love operated in her mind, and rendered her completely wretched. She mo[s]t [s]everely condemned her own folly, in liftening to the dictates of a mi[s]guided curio[s]ity; and acknowledged her[s]elf ju[s]tly puni[s]hed, for pre[s]uming to pry into the [s]ecret de[s]igns of Heaven. The[s]e [s]trolling pretenders to foreknowledge are peculiarly dangerous to the weak-minded and credulous part of the community; and how it happens that they are ever encouraged, is to me inconceivable. Did they actually give the information they promi[s]e, how much rea[s]on [s]hould we have to avoid them! How many [s]ources of grief would be opened, by the anticipation of future evils, of which, now, we have no apprehension! and how often [s]hould we be deprived of the con[s]olatory hope of a [s]peedy deliverance from pre[s]ent [s]ufferings! With every [s]entiment of re[s]pect and affection, I am mo[s]t [s]incerely your's. SOPHIA MANCHESTER. -  To Mi[s]s -  Boston DEAR ANNA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] A MOST melancholy and di[s]tre[s][s]ing event has [s]pread a gloom over the face of the metropolis. Every heart heaves the [s]ympathetic [s]igh, and every eye drops the tear of regret. The very [s]udden death of Doctor Clarke, who was [s]eized with an apoplectic fit, in the mid[s]t of his [s]ermon, ye[s]terday afternoon, and expired this morning, is a [s]ubject of univer[s]al lamentation. Not only we, who had the happine[s]s to [s]it under his mini[s]try, and to enjoy his particular friend[s]hip and attention, but the whole town; and, indeed, the public at large have [s]u[s]tained a great lo[s]s in his departure. Amiable in his disposition, engaging in his manners, and benevolent in his whole deportment, he conciliated the affections of every cla[s]s. His talents as a [s]cholar, philo[s]opher, and divine, commanded the re[s]pect of the mo[s]t judicious and learned; while the elegance, per[s]picuity and delicacy of his [s]tyle, joined with the undi[s][s]embled [s]eriou[s]ne[s]s of his manner, rendered him uniformly acceptable to the devout. In every condition and relation of life, he was exemplary as a Chri[s]tian; and as a preacher, an air of per[s]ua[s]ion invariably accompanied him, which arre[s]ted the attention of the mo[s]t heedle[s]s auditors. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] \---"By him, in [s]trains as [s]weet As angels u[s]e, the go[s]pel whi[s]per'd peace. Grave, [s]imple and [s]incere; in language plain; And plain in manner. Decent, [s]olemn, cha[s]te, And natural in ge[s]ture. Much impre[s]s'd Him[s]elf, as con[s]cious of his awful charge, And anxious mainly that the flock he [s]ed Might feel it too. Affectionate in look, And tender in addre[s]s, as well becomes A me[s][s]enger of grace to guilty men." He was particularly attractive to young people. While he charmed their ear, he convinced their under[s]tanding, and excited them to the love and practice of virtue. A [s]triking example of this occurred [s]ome years ago, which I will take the liberty to relate. He preached in a neighbouring church on the[s]e words, "She that liveth in plea[s]ure is dead while [s]he liveth." [7] In this di[s]cour[s]e he painted tho[s]e allurements of plea[s]ure which [s]urround the young and gay; more e[s]pecially of our [s]ex, in the mo[s]t ju[s]t and lively colours. He repre[s]ented, in pathetic, engaging and refined language, the [s]nares to which they are expo[s]ed, and the mo[s]t probable means of e[s]caping them. He exhibited, with all their attractions, the native charms of virtue, and pourtrayed vice in its true deformity. He described, in the mo[s]t animating terms, the respectability, u[s]efulne[s]s, and happine[s]s of tho[s]e who undeviatingly adhere to the path of rectitude [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] and innocence; and, with the mo[s]t energetic and affectionate tenderne[s]s, warned the youth to avoid the devious walks of vice and di[s][s]ipation. A number of young ladies, who had been his hearers, happening to be together in the evening, united in the wi[s]h to expre[s]s their gratitude to him; but not having a per[s]onal acquaintance with him, could devi[s]e no better method than writing. The following anonymous letter was accordingly penned by one of the company, and privately conveyed to the Doctor, at the reque[s]t of all. -  Boston "REVEREND SIR, " The well known candour of your disposition, and your apparent zeal for the promotion of religion and virtue, embolden us to flatter our[s]elves, that you will pardon this method of conveying to you our [s]incere and united thanks for your very [s]ea[s]onable, judicious, and u[s]eful di[s]cour[s]e, delivered la[s]t Sunday morning, at our meeting. "It is much to be lamented, that the depravity of the age is [s]uch, as to render [s]ermons of this nature ju[s]t and nece[s][s]ary; and it is almo[s]t matter of equal regret, that we have [s]o [s]eldom opportunities of being benefited by them. "That we oftener hear than receive instruction, is a truth which can neither be denied, nor evaded; and can only be accounted for, by that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] pa[s][s]ionate fondne[s]s for plea[s]ure, which prevails to [s]uch a degree of enthu[s]ia[s]m, as to precipitate its votaries into whatever pre[s]ents it[s]elf under this deluding a[s]pect, without con[s]idering whether it be durable, or fleeting. "It is certainly a mo[s]t humiliating reflection, that our [s]ex (which is the female) [s]hould ever take more pains to gain the qualifications of agreeable triflers than of rational friends; or be more anxious to become amufing , than u[s]eful companions. But, Sir, does not [s]uch conduct in ladies too often receive the mo[s]t flattering encouragement from the gentlemen? How [s]eldom is intrin[s]ic merit di[s]tingui[s]hed; and the [s]erious, prudent female pre[s]erred, even by tho[s]e who [s]tyle them[s]elves men of [s]en[s]e and penetration, to the airy flaunting coquette! "The con[s]tant attention which is paid to tho[s]e who make the gaye[s]t appearance, and the applause which is lavi[s]hed upon her who has the large[s]t portion of external graces and fa[s]hionable embelli[s]hments, induce many who entertain the good-natured de[s]ire of plea[s]ing, to be[s]tow more of their time and care on the cultivation of tho[s]e [s]uper[s]icial accompli[s]hments, which they find nece[s][s]ary to render them acceptable to mo[s]t circles into which they fall, than upon the acqui[s]ition of tho[s]e [s]ub[s]tantial virtues, which they daily [s]ee neglected and ridiculed; though, at the [s]ame time, perhaps, they are convinced of the superior [s]atisfaction which the latter would afford.

We allow, that, generally [s]peaking, they are equally to blame. In this in[s]tance, however, as the male a[s][s]ume the prerogative of [s]uperior judgment and intellectual abilities, they ought to prove the ju[s]tice of their claim by [s]etting nobler examples, and by endeavouring to reform whatever tends to vitiate the ta[s]te and corrupt the morals of [s]ociety. "Yet, after all, the evil cannot be effectually remedied, but by the concurrent exertions of both: and we are humbly of opinion, that if this reformation were more frequently inculcated from the pulpit, in the delicate, engaging, and pious manner of the di[s]cour[s]e which now excites our gratitude to you, and our re[s]olutions to conduct accordingly, it would be efficacious in bringing about [s]o de[s]irable an event. "We entreat your pardon, Reverend Sir, for the freedom, prolixity, and errors of this epi[s]tle.

The univer[s]al approbation be[s]towed upon tho[s]e, which he [s]uffered to [s]ee the light, is an unequivocal evidence of his merit, as an author. His "Letters to a Student in the Univer[s]ity of Cambridge," are written in a mo[s]t plea[s]ing [s]tyle, and contain in[s]truction and advice, of which no per[s]on in pursuit of a public education ought to be ignorant. His "An[s]wer to the que[s]tion, Why are you a Chri[s]tian?" which has already had three editions in Bo[s]ton, and three in England, is one of the be[s]t compendiums of the external and internal evidences of our holy religion, extant. It is plain and intelligible to the lowe[s]t capacity, and may enable every one without much [s]tudy, to give a rea[s]on for the hope that is in him. From the[s]e [s]pecimens we may form an opinion of what the world has lo[s]t by his early exit. I [s]hall make no other apology for the length of this letter, than the intere[s]t which I feel in the [s]ubject; and this, I am per[s]uaded, you will deem [s]ufficient. My affectionate regards wait on your mamma and [s]i[s]ter, while I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf your's mo[s]t [s]incerely, JULIA GREENFIELD.

Its value is certainly under-rated by tho[s]e who indulge them[s]elves in morning [s]loth. Sweet, indeed, is the breath of morn; and after the body has been refre[s]hed by the re[s]toring power of [s]leep, it is peculiarly prepared to procure and participate the plea[s]ures of the mind. The jarring pa[s][s]ions are then compo[s]ed, and the calm operations of rea[s]on [s]ucceed of cour[s]e; while "--- Gentle gales, Fanning their odoriferous wings, di[s]pen[s]e Native perfumes, and whi[s]per whence they [s]tole The[s]e balmy [s]poils." The morning is undoubtedly a [s]ea[s]on, of all others, mo[s]t favourable to u[s]eful exertions. Tho[s]e, therefore, who lo[s]e three or four hours of it, in [s]lumbering inaction, make a voluntary [s]acrifice of the be[s]t part of their exi[s]tence. I ro[s]e to-day, not with the [s]un, but with the dawn; and after taking a few turns in the garden, retired to the [s]ummer-hou[s]e. This, you know, is a favourite hour with me.

Having a memorandum-book and pencil in my pocket, I de[s]cended from the lofty heights to which the immortal bard, my beloved Thomp[s]on, had in[s]en[s]ibly rai[s]ed my imagination, to the humble [s]trains of [s]imple rhyme, in order to communicate my [s]en[s]ations to you.

O dawn! thy [s]ombre [s]hades I love; With thee in [s]olitude I'll rove; While health expan[s]ive gives the mind To ta[s]te thy plea[s]ures unconfin'd. Here, free from fa[s]hions artful forms, Benevolence the bo[s]om warms; Per[s]ua[s]ive virtue charms the [s]oul, And rea[s]on's laws alone control. Let others, lo[s]t in [s]loth, forego The joys thy early hours be[s]tow; Thy zephyrs far more [s]weets di[s]pen[s]e, Than Somnus yields to drow[s]y [s]en[s]e! Mild as thy beams of radiance [s]hine, May piety my powers refine; Pure as thy mimic pearls, that [s]pread Their liquid beauties o'er the mead; And, like you ri[s]ing orb of day, May wi[s]dom guide my dubious way. -  To Mi[s]s -  Harmony-Grove DEAR MATILDA, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 246. ] I WAS, la[s]t week, at Bo[s]ton; and, having occa[s]ion for a new hat, [s]tepped into a milliner's [s]hop to inquire the mode. The milliner replied, that it was not yet in her power to an[s]wer my que[s]tion. "The [s]pring [s]hips," [s]aid [s]he "are later than common; but their arrival is hourly expected, when we [s]hall be furni[s]hed with memorandum-books which will a[s]certain and determine the fa[s]hion for the [s]ea[s]on." What [s]he meant by memorandum-books, I could not conceive. I had always [s]uppo[s]ed them blanks, designed for noting whatever occurred, without inconvenience. Unwilling, however, to be thought a [s]imple country-girl, totally unacquainted with the world, I [s]ought no explanation from her; but repaired to a particular friend for in[s]truction. From whom I learned that the chief value of the[s]e [s]ame memorandum-books con[s]i[s]ts in their containing imported cuts of ladies' head-dre[s][s]es, hats, and other habiliments, which are always [s]ure to be admired and imitated, as the perfection of ta[s]te and propriety! This di[s]covery mortified me exceedingly. It ju[s]tified, beyond any thing which I had ever suspected to exi[s]t as a fact, what I once heard a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 247. ] European affert, "that Americans had neither character nor opinion of their own." With due deference to tho[s]e better judges, who de[s]pi[s]e the [s]implicity of our ance[s]tors, and labour to introduce the corrupt manners and cu[s]toms of the old world into our country, I cannot but think it extremely ridiculous for an independent nation, which di[s]eards all foreign influence, glories in its freedom, and boa[s]ts of its genius and ta[s]te, [s]ervilely to ape exotic fa[s]hions, even in articles of dre[s]s and fanciful ornaments. Have not the daughters of Columbia sufficient powers of invention to decorate them[s]elve? Mu[s]t we depend upon the winds and waves for the form, as well as the materials of our garb? Why may we not follow our own inclination; and not be deemed finical or prudi[s]h in our appearance, merely becau[s]e our habit is not exactly corre[s]pondent with the pretty pictures in the memorandum-books, la[s]t imported? It is [s]incerely to be regretted that this [s]ubject is viewed in [s]o important a light. It occupies too much of the time, and engro[s][s]es too much of the conver[s]ation of our [s]ex. For one, I have [s]erious thoughts of declaring independence. ANNA WILLIAMS. -  To Mi[s]s On the Death of her Mother -  Harmony-Grove MY DEAR CAROLINE, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 248. ] TO tell you that I am [s]orry for your lo[s]s, or that I [s]ympathize with you in your affliction, would be but the language you daily hear; and often, perhaps, from the unfeeling and indifferent. But, you will do me the ju[s]tice to believe, that I take a particular intere[s]t in your concerns, and really [s]hare your grief. A holy Providence has wounded you by a [s]troke, which is extremely painful and fevere. Your be[s]t friend is [s]hrounded in the grave. In the maternal brea[s]t, your fondest affections, and mo[s]t un[s]u[s]pecting confidence have hitherto concentred; and who can provide you with an equivalent [s]ub[s]titute? To the almighty Father and Friend of creation, it becomes you to repair for comfort and [s]upport. The dying advice and coun[s]el of your dear mamma, which, you inform me, were pathetic, in[s]tructive and con[s]olatory, will be a guide to your feet. Often realize the [s]olemn [s]cene, and remember, that, "though dead, [s]he yet [s]peaketh." You have great cau[s]e of thankfulne[s]s, that [s]he was [s]pared to direct you [s]o far through the intricate and dangerous path of youth; to complete [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 249. ] your education; to teach you, by her example, how to acquit your[s]elf with u[s]efulne[s]s and honor; and, above all, to furni[s]h you with that important knowledge, to which every thing el[s]e [s]hould be made [s]ub[s]ervient---how to die! An era of your life has now commenced, which is no le[s]s important than affecting. That a[s][s]i[s]ting hand, which formerly led you, is now cold and lifele[s]s! Tho[s]e lips, from which you have been accu[s]tomed to receive information and advice, are [s]ealed in perpetual [s]ilence! And that heart, which always glowed with the warme[s]t solicitude for your happine[s]s, has cea[s]ed to palpitate! You mu[s]t now think and act for yourself. As the elde[s]t daughter, you will be placed at the head of your father's family. You mu[s]t, therefore, adopt a plan of conduct, conducive to its harmony, regularity, and intere[s]t. Filial duty to your [s]urviving parent, more tenderly inculcated by your participation of his heavy bereavement, will lead you to con[s]ult his inclination, and [s]edulou[s]ly contribute all in your power to lighten the burden of dome[s]tic arrangements devolved upon him. While he laments the death of a prudent, affectionate, and beloved wife, give him rea[s]on to rejoice, that he is ble[s][s]ed with a daughter, capable of [s]oothing the pains, alleviating the cares, and heightening the enjoyments of his life. Your brothers and [s]i[s]ters will look up to you as the guide of their tender years. While their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 250. ] weeping eyes and pathetic accents are directed towards you, let kindne[s]s, di[s]cretion, and patience, characterize your deportment, and engage their confidence and love. Having mentioned your duty to others, I cannot di[s]mi[s]s the [s]ubject without dropping a few hints for your direction, in regard to your personal behaviour. A very important charge is committed to you, as well in the duties which you owe to your[s]elf, as in the [s]uperintendence of your father's family. The [s]overeign Di[s]po[s]er of all things has, at an early age, made you, in a mea[s]ure, your own guardian. Your father's bu[s]ine[s]s calls him much abroad. With you, therefore, he is obliged to entru[s]t, not only his dome[s]tic concerns; but, what is [s]till more dear to his heart, the care of your own per[s]on and mind; of your own reputation and happine[s]s. Circum[s]tanced as you are, company has the mo[s]t powerful charms. Your's is now the prerogative of receiving and returning vi[s]its in your own name. At home, you are [s]ole mi[s]tre[s]s of ceremonies. This is extremely alluring to the [s]prightly fancy of youth. But time, you will remember, is too important a ble[s][s]ing to be sacrificed to a promi[s]cuous crowd of unimproving companions. Be[s]ides, the character of a young lady will nece[s][s]arily be [s]ullied by the imputation of being con[s]tantly engaged in parties of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 251. ] pleasure, and exhilarating amu[s]ement. Flattery often avails it[s]elf of the unguarded moments of gaiety; and, in[s]inuating its in[s]idious charms into the heedle[s]s and [s]u[s]ceptible mind, inflates it with pride and vanity, and produces an affectation and air of [s]elf-importance, which are peculiarly difgusting, becau[s]e ea[s]ily di[s]tingui[s]hed from that true dignity of manners, which re[s]ults from conscious rectitude. Genuine merit is always mode[s]t and una[s][s]uming; diffident of it[s]elf, and respectful to others. Your father has a right to your unlimited confidence. You will, therefore, make him your chief friend and coun[s]ellor. Though he may not po[s][s]e[s]s all the winning [s]oftne[s]s of a mother, he doubtle[s]s has as ardent an affection for you, and as [s]incere a de[s]ire to promote your welfare. Hence you may [s]afely repo[s]e your deare[s]t concerns in his paternal brea[s]t, and receive, with the utmo[s]t deference, his kind in[s]truction and advice. Let his judgment have an entire a[s]cendency over your mind and actions, e[s]pecially in your intercourse and [s]ociety with the other [s]ex. Con[s]ider him as better acquainted with their merit, circumstances, and views, than you can be; and, [s]hould you contemplate a connexion for life, let his opinion determine your choice. Watch over your dear little [s]i[s]ters, with all the tenderne[s]s of fraternal affection; be their protecttor and friend; in[s]til into their minds the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf105&image=105-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 252. ] principles of virtue and religion; arm them again[s]t the [s]nares and temptations by which they will be [s]urrounded; and lead them, by your own conduct, in the way of truth and peace. When you have lei[s]ure and inclination to write, the effu[s]ions of your pen will always be acceptable to your [s]incere and faithful friend, MARY WILLIAMS. THE END.
