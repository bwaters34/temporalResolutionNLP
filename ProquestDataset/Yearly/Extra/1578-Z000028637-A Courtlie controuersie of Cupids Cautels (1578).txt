 poyson, I haue presumed to preset the same vnto your honor, as my bounde duety bindeth me, although vnworthy of comendatio (being the first fruits of my baraine braine) as well to discontinue the irksomnesse of idle afternones, when it may please your contented leysure to peruse the same, as also for three other special causes, vz. Policy, Loue  & Hope: Vpo Policy, bicause dayly proof breedeth experience, that a weake souldier obtaineth best entertainemente and surest safegard vnder the banner or ensigne of the noblest, strong, and valiaunt captain: which moued me to imitate the like, shrouding my simplicity vnder the flag of your fauourable protectio, therby accouting my self armed at proofe to defend mine originall traueil fro the assaults of Zoylus, Momus , or Baalit , with al their carping consortes. Vpon Loue, wherunto nature and obedience yoketh me, not only for so much as I haue bene perticipant of yours, proceding from a most natural sister, but that dayly experiece notifyeth to the world your noble minde, natural loue, and bountiful liberalitie towards al the poore Orphanes of my good Lorde his and our noble mother, since hir deceasse: besides your vertuous minde and honorable countenace to al those that perseuer in vertues pathes, especially shewing any apparat notice therof by their acts. Vpon Hope, in that hope leadeth me to hope your wisdome wil like these discourses so wel, by your wise consideration therof, as thereby I hope I shall be incouraged both to spend my time effectually hereafter,  & also obtaine your honorable patronage in more weightie attepts. And although my naked phrase be not so purely pollished as I would, nor my well doing (if ther be any) so wel as I wish, I hope your Honour wil vouchsafe to say for me, Jn magnis & voluisse sat est . For the whiche crauing pardo of my tedious rudenesse, I humbly beseeche the blessed Trinitie to graunt you continuall ioy, with increase of al honor vpon earth, and after the Metamorphosis of this transitorie life Summam foelicitatem . Amen. Your honours louing brother euer prest at your commaundement. HENRIE. VVOTTON. whatsoeuer is written, is written for our learning and instruction: and that experience persuadeth vs, and our eyes are sufficient witnesses, howe the profitable Bee draweth honye out of the floure from whece the Spider sucketh poyson. And contrariwise, sithence at this day so many moathes of Momus wander about the worlde, carping, and crookedly construing such commendable Discourses, as many flourishing wittes vnacquaynted with grauer causes haue carefully composed, to consolate and consume the yrkesomnes of ydle seasons, to the great pleasure and profite of the painfull peruser. My quill remayned long (as men say) in a mamorie, quiuering in my quaking fingers, before I durst presume to publishe these my fantasies. VVhiche beeing Historicall (considering howe greatly tragicall histories haue bin commended and esteemed of late dayes, euen in suche sorte as it seemeth a shame vnto all Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, nurtured in the schole of curtesie, but principally vnto Courtiers, to be ignoraunt thereof) I concluded at last to proceede in the setting forth of this Treatise. And although neither witte nor wisedome may appeare in the Translation, yet accept gratefully the Authors good will, who persuadeth thee in reading thereof not to feede thy fantasie with the vayne curiosities and follies thou shalt encounter therein, but wish to waigh to what ende the sense tendeth, so mayst thou taste the carnell which a fruitlesse shell encloseth. I doubt not (gentle Reader) but some scoffing at the barrennesse of my brayne, will say, Quam quisque norit artem in hac se exerceat . I can not deny (and voluntarie confession deserueth halfe a pardon) but my skill is small, and mine experience lesse, yet meaning better than I am able to perfourme, beeing persuaded that Timidi nunquam statuerunt ad tropheum , as bolde as blinde Bayarde, I haue prosecuted the finall execution of mine enterprise, beeing resolued to [illeg.] the battery of all gunneshot, hoping some fauourable supply will succour me as necessitie shall require, which if I encounter, it shall encourage my simplicitie to attempt with tedious trauayle more hawtie matters. In the meane time solace thy senses (good Reader) with these dainty Discourses, and indifferently yeelde thy iudgement vppon these Courtely controuersies of Cupids Cautels . VVherein if thou find any faults passed in the printing, pardon the Printers speedie dispatche therein, for at the phrase I knowe thou shalt haue cause to frowne, beeing translated so neare vnto the Frenche as our Englishe toung will tollerate, which may seeme in many steedes straunge vnto thee. But if happily thou desirest the knowledge of the Frenche toung, conferre the works togither, and I doubt not thou shalt finde some contentation of thy desire. All the rest I referre to thy courteous construction, hoping that if thou construe eche cause aright, thou shalt reape by reading these fonde fantasies suche pleasure and profite, as will giue thee iust cause to gratifie my well meaning with thy good worde, whiche onely rewarde I require in lieu of my laboursome Labyrinth. Farewell . instincte, include vnder their simple shapes their proper price and valure: Notwithstanding eche one in hys kinde, seemeth more riche and estimable, beeyng cunningly sette in golde, by the curious workmanship of the expert goldsmith. Euen so (according to my iudgement) although wordes wisely spoken, and deeds vertuously done, deserue great commendation: The same neuerthelesse shew a greater excellencie, and importe more maiestie, beyng collected and placed by the diligent trauell of some fauourable writer, in any worke consecrated vnto immortality, and registred in the Library of eternall memory, to remayne a President, or rather perpetuall Relicke, vnto all future posterities. The consideration whereof, hath gained so great aucthority ouer me, as (giuing me no time of quiet) doth continually pricke me forward, or rather enforce me, to bring to lyght such pleasante deuises beautified with straunge discourses, as with great admiration, I heard but lately, learnedly vttered in a right honorable companie, least that, obliuion, whiche enuiously seeketh to suppresse and burie in hir entrayles things most memorable: shoulde both depriue the aucthors of my trauaile, of the honour due vnto them, and glory they haue deserued: and also robbe al courteous minds fauouring courtly inuentions of the pleasure, whiche they may receiue by the knowledge thereof. So as mee thinketh, we are of duty bounde, to endeuoure our selues, to famish this infernall helhounde, which in deuouring oure bodyes seeketh to extinguish the memorie of our passed life. Yet must I needes confesse (notwythstanding the greate good will, whiche vrgeth me forward) that the mistrust of my disabilitie to finishe this enterprise (the whiche giueth me perfecte knowledge of my selfe without flatterie) at the firste encounter hath for feare frozen the ynke in my penne, knowing the carping wittes of oure age, to be so cloyed with the sower taste of loathsome disdayne, as there is no sawce sufficient (howe delicate so euer it be) to restore again their appetite, or at ye leaste, to giue them knowlege that ye vnsauory fault they find in their meate, resteth in their vnseasoned mouths. So that enuy accustomed to fasten hir slanderous railing phangs, vpon the moste commendable works in rewarde of their good meaning, wil not spare my simple phrase, too weake to defend it selfe against so horrible a moster, as Hercules himselfe could neuer coquer. Neuerthelesse, considering that the most rightfull iudges do not regard ye depositio of one witnes in matters of waight, but haue consideration to the equitie of the cause, I am encouraged with a newe hardinesse, knowing yt my determined intet in this small Treatise, is not to counterfaite yt eloquent Oratour, but rather like a faithfull secretary to report the pleasant discourses, and memorable histories, propounded to passe away the irkesomnesse of certain ydle afternoons, by a gallant assembly of yong Gentlemen, and damosels of France , which at a feaste of Pentecost were gathered togyther, and stedfastly purposed in their friendly visitation, with pleasure to suppresse the turmoiles and disquiet receyued duryng the miserable ciuill warres, and to season the bitter salt, whiche mighte reuiue the remembraunce thereof. Like as toyled mariners readye to be swallowed with euery surge, reioice to see the mightie mounting waues appeased by a quyet calme, after a tempestuous flawe, or as the small birdes prune themselues among the yong greene leaues, whiche the pleasant spring lendeth to euery twig, after a long and hard Winter: Euen so of custome, reason teacheth man, after a long and tedious trauell, to seeke the place of rest moste pleasant and agreeable to his contentment, not onely bycause diuersitie of delightes doeth recreate Nature: but for so muche as the exchaunge of euill into good, is to bee desired and very profitable. Wherefore after the recouery of the contagious plague of Fraunce, (which may be well termed a franticke feuer) beeyng subiecte to so manye infirmities, as scarcely the thirde letting of bloud was sufficient to remedy the sicknesse (the poore body was so weake and bare.) Euery man had free libertie to returne into his owne habitation, by the happy conclusion of a peace, conceyued in the kings heart by diuine inspiration. It need not to be demaunded, with what gladnesse and contetation eche one receiued the commoditie of their possessions, so long detained from them by the rigor of the wars: surely it was no lesse tha the ioy of the aged father, which beholdeth the return of his only child; whose death he hath bewailed many a day, or of the condemned prisoner, when he receiueth his vnexpected pardon: wherby it is manifest, that the greater griefe a man endureth, ye more delight he taketh in a little ease, which is verefied by the Persian king, who being put to flight by his enimy, found more sauor in drinking ye puddle water to quench his thirst, tha in tasting the most delicious wines for his pleasure. I dare assure you, that in all ye coasts of France no man repaired with greater contentation into their desolate houses, than the inhabitants of the country of Poytow , who thoughte themselues possessed of newe mansions, esteeming whatsoeuer they foud vnspoiled by ye insolet souldiors, to be gotten goods. Thus ye country being quiet,  & euery thing in order, as necessitie required, nothing delighted ye people more, tha to visite one another, to comunicate togither & vnrip their great losses, & like friends linked in the chaine of neighborly amitie, to comfort the distresse of their comon misery. This charitable vse was principally practised by ye nobilitie of the countrey, who do vse of auntient custome to allie and vnite their houses by familiar acquaintance, and band of kinred, wherby their estates continue more sure and their honoure more established and excellent. Among the whiche, three young Gentlemen, kinsmen, and neighbors (meeting vpon a day, as it had bene of purpose) determined at the feast of Pentecost (which was at hande) to visite a Ladie that kept the nexte castell, and to passe the tyme with hir all the holydays: assuring themselues she would be verie glad of their companie, as in deede they deserued to bee welcome in all places both for their honestie and good education. But lest that I shoulde offend the parties, which I would be loath to do, in vttering their proper names, thinking therby to aduaunce their credite, I haue thoughte good to imitate suche as play vpon stages, who vnder masking shapes represente the true personages of whome their Comedies or Tragedies entreate. Euen so I meane, vnder counterfayte names to coloure the truth, enforcing Patroclus to skirmishe wyth the armours of Achilles . Wherfore we will dub our three Gentlemen knights, which shal be presented vpon this Theatre, and will name them according to our aucthour Sire Bel acoeuil, Sire Fleur d'amour , and Sire Firme Foy . And the place of their disport, the Castell de Printemps , builded long since, as is certainly reported, by the famous enchauntresse Melleusine , to shewe the excellencie of hir secrete science, leauing therin many monuments of hir miracles enterpreted by prophecies, whiche I would not discouer, but bycause they touche the description of the place, besides the situation, the commodities whereof do well testifye the wisedome of the builder, and giueth admiration to the beholder, so as the passer by, is constrayned to make longer abode, than leysure permitteth, to feede his hungry eie wyth the speculation of the miraculous edifice, the workmanship whereof is so curious, as those which haue viewed the Castell, do iudge it to be the moste sumptuous and excellent building that may be seene: yet all the strange deuises, whiche are outwardly to be discerned, or nothing in comparison of the wonders whyche are enclosed within the same, whiche beyng well considered, yeeldeth the castel nothing inferiour to the renoumed Palace of the Soudan of Vltibie , the statelinesse wherof, disdaineth the glory of the gorgeous Piramides of Saue : for the hugenesse therof is such, that a ma may easily wander all his life as in a Labyrinth, among the infinit deuisions of large paued halles, parlours, chambers, galleries, closets, porches, toures, armories, vaults, tarresies, and cloisters, with other innumerable roomths and offices, requisite in a building of suche excellencie: so sumptuously glased, plaistred, grauen, and gilte, supported wyth a wonderfull sorte of arches, pillers, images, monsters, serpents, beasts, fishes, and foules of all kindes, so cunningly carued, enriched, and beautified with suche singular kindes of coloures, vernished after the Damaskin manner, as the very walles seeme to be of glasse, wherevppon are represented a greate number of memorable histories of olde time, wyth a thousande discriptions, epitaphes, verses, riddles, and poesies, containing the effect of their subiects, with diuers other strange deuises, sufficient to rauishe and astonie the most rude and leaden wits, and to bind mens bodies with the cheines of their eies, rauishing from them all appetite of meate, drinke, or sleepe, like soules assotted with maruell. Although these things are greatly to be estemed, so it is, that greedie curiositie passing forward, shal encounter newe matter of more abashement, for it seemeth that nature had debate and contention wyth the excellency of the workmanshippe, and enuying the same, to obtaine the victorye, added hir whole endeuor and power bountifully to impart thervpon the iewels of hir precious threasury, to the ende the world shoulde wonder at hir mightie puissance. So as she hath beautified the delectable soile whereon our surpassing spectacle is situate, with a thousande fountaines, woodes, meddowes, riuers, groues, brookes, and other country commodities: as Orchards, planted with al kind of fruite trees, set in due order by line and leuell, deuided into diuers pleasaunt walkes: goodly gardens, ful of gallant allies, knottes, mounts, mazes, seates, bankes, and arbors of all sorts, yelding moste aromaticke sauours, breathed from a multitude of odoriferous floures of euerye kinde, besydes a number of pleasante vniforme pondes placed in seuerall Parkes, abounding with al kindes of game, very strongly walled or impaled, adioining to the Castel. To be short, there wanted nothing that wisedome, wealth, or workmanshippe mighte compasse: yea a man cannot imagine or desire greater perfection to bee in any earthly Paradise. Al these commodities althoughe they deserue to bee considered with greate admiration, for theyr excellentnesse and singularitie, yet are they to bee accompted, but as fading fantasies, and mortified vanities: If twoo soueraigne bewties, hauing theyr mansions in thys massie body of delights like two diuine soules, did not reuiue the same: for as the Goldsmith doth set a stone of great value in a peece of golde finely wrought, therby to aduance his cunning workmanship, or as the pleasant recording bird is kept in a delicate cage: euen so it pleased the wisedom of the Almightie, to bestow this gallant harbour vpon two Hostesses, whose diuine perfection surmounted the Magnificence of the humaine Arte: hauyng enriched the Lady of this Castell (who was a wydowe) wyth a daughter and a neece, so perfectly accomplished in euery part with diuine beautie, vertuous nouriture, curteous  & courtly behauior, as they seemed not only to be the chosen Paragons of the earth, and creatures woorthye of suche an habitation, vnwoorthy to receyue them, but also rather created of God, and sente from heauen, than begotten by man, and borne in the worlde. The daughter was called Mary , and the neece Margaret . These Damoysels entertayned our three knyghts so curteously, being ariued at vnwares, vnlooked for, as they had greate occasion to bee satisfyed both with the great worshyp doone to them by the Ladye of the place, and with the modeste demeanour of the maydens. Thus after sundry hartie and affectionate welcomes, with one consente it was determined among them, vtterly to exclude al sadnesse, and that no care shuld be taken, but to inuente with what recreation they myghte passe the tyme moste pleasauntlye, and deuise newe pastimes. That nyght oure newe guests refreshed theyr weary limmes, after their trauaile. The nexte morning, the spring of the day no sooner appeared, but well was hee that coulde fyrste arise to giue the camisado to the moste sluggarde in the companye. Then halfe readye after the fyrste worke was presented to God, concernyng the duety requisyte to holynesse and deuotion, not onelye required in the good gouernement of a familie well instructed, but according to the tribute due by euerye good Christian, they passed the time in their chamber, wyth tenne thousande preaty pastimes, vntil the Sunne displaying his beames, had abated the moysture of the fresh dewe. Then running and leaping wantonly, they romed amog the fine sweet borders, wher they made large spoils of the floures, which vnfolding their tender leaues, at the breache of the gray morning, seemed to open their smiling eies, whiche were oppressed wyth the drowsinesse of the passed night, and ioyfully to beholde the newe chearefull daye. Thus the Gentlemen hauing their hats, handkerchers, and pockets, and the maidens their laps full of this amorous bootie, skirmished to the vtterance, throwing one at another handfuls of roses, and other blossoms, wherof they made such lauishe expence, as the ground was almost couered with the strowing therof. In the meantime a suptuous diner was prepared, wherat theyr bodyes were not more filled wyth delicate dainties, than their mindes satisfied wyth pleasaunte deuisings. The table being taken away, and grace saide, the musicke beganne to sounde, augmented wyth the harmonye of sundry instruments, whiche continued vntill theyr wandring affections compelled them to take the aire. Beyng abrode, they gathered their bosoms ful of diuers flowers, which they forcibly rauished from the teat of their loving mother, wadring to  & fro through the thickets of a fine grouet, in the which ye shadow was so coole, as a man wold haue thought at noone time of the day, the Sunne had bin upon setting. Among the fresh leaues wherof a thousand small birdes chirped their amorous layes, concording their minion plaintes with the whispering course of the smal running streams, bordering upon ye woods, where this lusty youthful troupe being arriued under the conduct of ye discrete Lady their hostesse, after sundry pleasures received in their walkes (as to beholde the young lambes frisking and leaping by the sides of their dams, nibling and brettying the toppes of the preatye pagles, in the greene pastures, to viewe the Rammes in mayne courses meete togyther wyth suche fierce encounters of theyr horned foreheades, as they were manye tymes ouerthrowne wyde open vppon the grasse, to make posies, garlandes, and chaplettes of all fashions, wherof some they put upon their heades, to shadowe their faces, some they ware aboute their neckes, some uppon theyr armes) they deuised of suche pleasante matter, as beste liked their fantasies, and moste aptely fitted the purpose. Then as appetite moued them, they comaunded a banquet of Cheries, Strawberies, Thespes, Raspes, Dewberies, Chessenuttes, Walnuttes, Almonds, greene Figs, Husellnuttes, Creame, and fresh Cheese, wyth sundry sallets, and other conceites of the season, to be brought vnder a wreathed arbor of Laurell, Jessemen, Holly, and Iuy, whose tender twigges surely twisted and enterfolded, durste not passe their limited boundes. The banquet ended, they spent the residue of the after noone in walking and talking untill it was supper time, whyche by the commaundement of the Lady was prepared in the same place, and the cloth couered vpon a rounde table of stone, enuironed with a banke of wrethed boughes, whiche serued verye commodiously for benches to sitte vppon. After supper (where wanted no dainties) beyng risen from the table, euery Gentleman choosing one, walked arme in arme very soberly towardes the standing waters and runnying streames, where they entred into a barge of purpose prouided, hauyng no feryman but themselves. The Damosels, who coulde neyther bee idle nor well occupied, trussing their garments roundly aboute them, for feare of wetting, entreated the Gentlemen (more ready to obey, than they to commaunde) to hale the nettes which the fishermen had sette to take fishe, wherein they found great store, the viewe wherof so conteted them, as they consumed the time in the beholding of the choice & diuersitie therof, vntil the night spreading hir black mantle, caused them to returne toward their lodging, shortning the waye with pleasant tales and pretie pastimes, as propounding of questions, absoluing of rioles, performing of commaundements, making of purposes, espying of maruels, and such like, vntill they were arriued at the Castell: Where after manye daunces, both brawles and rounds, by the sounde of the Lute, Flute, and Bagpipe, wherevpon the clownes of the Countrey are verye cunning, as it were by succession euen from the father to the sonne, and doe make their rusticall instrumentes by their inuention of rurall magicke. Oure gallantes weary of this sporte, fell to singing of Sonets and Ditties, eche one in his order. In the meane time was prepared a collation of perseruatiues, confects, and other pretie conceits: The whyche deuoured, red, and leaue taken on all partes, euerye one repaired to hys chamber, where they rested vntill the nexte morning, the which approching presented other newe disports. Thys courtly companye demeaned this delicate life the space of eight dayes, during the whiche time, one afternone seekyng a conuenient place to shadowe their bodies from the extreame heate of the Sunne, they founde a tufte of trees very delelectable for the coolenesse of the place. In the middest of the same was a fountaine, at the headspring whereof was eleuate the figure of an old hermit, very workemanly carued out of Marble stone, the whiche Image seemed to be there placed, to honoure and bewtifie the roomthe. The copanye beholding the stone attentiuely, gaue their iudgementes diuersly: One sayde it was Sainct Ierome mortified, another saide it was Sainct Anthony, appointed to keepe the Acornes, thus euerye one pronounced hys seuerall opinion. And in this controuersye they stayed to reade a scroll hanging down from the hand of the Image, the content whereof was. If thundring threates of mightie Ioue aboue, If monstrous shapes from God among vs sente, If bitter plagues, whereof we dayly proue, Had power to make mankynde his lyfe repent, Man shoulde not neede to feare the fleying whip, VVhiche dothe for sinne his guiltie conscience nip. The rodde wherewith the Lorde doth scourge vs still, The promised plagues of vengeance in his ire, Is to enforce man to obey his wyll, And shunne the debt of his deserued hire. The louing Lorde dothe warne vs day by day, Yet we rebell, and lust to runne astray. Eche fishe that swimmes, eche foule that buildes a nest, Eche blooming plante, eche hearbe, and fruitfull tree, Eche creping worme, and euery liuing beaste, Brings forth encrease, eche one in their degree. They prayse the Lorde according to their kinde, They prayse the Lorde according to their kinde, They liue and dye, as nature hathe assinde. All things on earthe, created by the Lorde, VVere to sustaine the needefull life of man: And man at laste was formed by his worde, And of the earthe, by God possession wanne, Redeemed eke from sinne by Christe his sonne, VVhose Godhead was before the worlde begonne: Be thankfull man, repent, and turne againe, Let not thy sauiours bloude be shed in vaine. Surueying anew the image, & scanning the effect of the verses, the lady tooke occasion to discouer from the depthe the nature of man, and to inuey against his ingratitude, the mother of his misery, beginning at Adam, and declining from one generation to another vnto this latter age, which is so wicked and corrupte, as all thinges are moste like to retourne into their auncient confusion. To this effect (saide she) commeth to my remembraunce a ditty, whiche I composed in the extremitie of our late calamities, when I thought our helpe was paste all recouerie. At whiche tyme bycause I coulde finde no companion, eyther to comforte me, or helpe to complaine my great sorrowe, I learned to sing it to my lute, wherevnto I praye you attend. Then taking the instrumente, after a musicall preamble, framing hir voice to the tune of hir lute, she began in this maner: VVhat kinde of newe suspect Doth grudge my broylyng breaste? VVhat griping griefe, or straunge conceite, Bereaues my minde of reste? VVhat horrour new at hande Doth dull my senses so? VVhat slicing blade doth cutte my gale By force of mortall foe? VVhose cruell bloudy pawes, So fiercely me assayles, As still me thinkes, I feele hym teare My hearte with goarye nayles. The flames of Æ tna mounte, VVhose smoothers pierce the aire, Consumes not so, as I doe waste, VVith enuy, rage and care, To viewe in euery coaste, The garnisons so thicke, Of brainsicke souldiours, whom the spoiles Of natiue soile doth pticke, And headlong doth enforce, To baine the fieldes in bloode Of countrey soules, without remorse Of Fraunce their mother good. VVith sorrowe I consume, Like snowe againste the Sunne, Mine eies with teares like flowing streames Continually doe runne: My face with ashes foule, My golden tresse is shorne, My hearte in sorrowe closed fast, My pleasant dayes are worne, My pinching pining pangs My penne shall nowe disclose, The worlde shal knowe my driery playntes The cause of these my vvoes. My sadde and pensiue song. Runne with dispersed lockes: Proclayme my griefe in dolefull tunes, Among the woodes and rockes Goe cladde in mourners weede, Trusse vp thy garmentes rounde, Hye to the Mountes of Apennine . Doe there my verses sounde. VVhere Arno floudes, and Po , VVith Eccho may reporte My sighes, my sobbes, and harde mishap, To suche as there resorte. Tell them the Frenchmen they, VVho by their valiant might, So oftentymes in fierce conflictes Their armies put to flighte, Nowe doubte and feare themselues, Nowe doe they seeke no more Reuenge of wrong receyude, they seeke To salue their present sore. Tell Italy alas, That Milan neede not feare, But liue in peace with Naples nowe, That Fraunce is in dispaire. Tell Germany la bas , VVhere Mos the running flood, Doth leade his course by mount & rocke, Through many a dale and wood VVhose people taught to crouche, By force of our assaultes, Constraynde to flee their walled Townes, And hide themselues in vaultes: VVishe them and those that holde The fruitfull bankes of Rhine , Like brethren now to length our liues, VVith some reliefe in tyme. You Europe Princes all, VVhiche sometime sought for peace, Thereby to staye the Frenchmens force Their kingdome to encreace, VVhome you with all your power, Coulde not in forrayne soyle Resiste, afflicted nowe you seeke Like carion crowes to spoile: Not one is absent nowe, The carkasse to deuoure, VVhose fleshe then in your greedy mawes Had made your sauce but sowre. Thus is the Lion stoute, VVhome euery beaste did feare, Assailed nowe, and marched on Of euery trembling hare. Oh Fraunce , whose mightie power, And famous highe renoume, Surmounted for hir valiantnesse Eche country king and towne, VVhat dire mishap more harde, VVhat more vnhappy ende, Coulde fortune frame, than force perforce Thy fame to ruine sende. Must needes thy fatall blade, Not hauing whome to kill, Againste thy selfe his bloudy rage In fury worke his will? As noble Romaines did, The conquerours of all, VVho after thousand battels wonne Did worke their fatall fall, VVhen rancor taking roote, Their mightie hande did arme Against themselues, to rue the liues They shoulde haue kept from harme. As he that hath the goute, Doth dayly wishe for death, Or he that into dropsie falles, VVoulde stop his vitall breath: Or as the man that liues In painefull pangs, doth crie And call for death, to end his griefe, And yet hee can not die, But takes some poysned drugge At laste to ende his life: So Fraunce by murthering man and child VVoulde ende our cankred strife. The roaring Lion fierce, Or furious Leoperds rage, VVith no suche frensie trackes they pray Their hunger to asswage: Nor Tigre dothe pursue More greedely, the thiefe That steales hir yong, or faster packes To giue hir whelpes reliefe, Than doth our scattered troupes, In armes with fury fraughte, Againste themselues suche slaughter make As bringeth all to naught. The fieldes are bathed in the bloud, Euen of their children deare, And churchyards now of common groundes Doe euery where appeare: And cankred spighte hath wrought By heapes of bodies dead, That frothye ryuers whyte as mylke Are dyed scarlet redde. Thus eche man vrged on By madde reuenging moodes, Lyke franticke fooles do quite forget The losse of wife and goodes. The father dothe not spare, To bathe his bloudy knife, VVithin the bowels of the babe That by himselfe had lyfe: The childe nowe growne a man, Cuttes off his syers head, And dothe reioice with mery moode To see his father deade: The brother feares his ende, Leaste brother do aduaunce, Thus all estates to ruine runne, Throughout the realme of Fraunce. The mischiefe wrought by men, The battering Cannons shotte, Destroyeth castels, fortes, and townes, That valiant Princes gotte. The auncient myghtie walles, VVhere stately Cities stoode, Lies flatte and beaten to the earth, Imbrude in Burgers bloode. The wealth we wallowed in Before our wofull wracke, Conuerted is by country foes, To pillage, spoyle, and sacke. The reuerend aged sires Obeye these lawlesse mates, VVho lyke vnbridled Helhoundes, beare Of men the onely shapes: They dayly seeke to haue The vvealth man can not giue, So they do get, they do not force Howe hardly others lyue. The olde distressed dames Doe rende their grisly heare, To see the maydes by bloudy beastes, Defloured euery where. Oh tiranny vniuste, Oh crueltie vnkinde, My heare with horrour stands on end, In vttering of my minde: You people neyghbours nere, Yet farre from any blowe, Bewaile the state of our decay, Lament our ouerthrowe. And though our ship do sincke In viewe of you on shore, Let not the storme that works our wracke, Make you reioice the more. Quake at our hard mishap, Least you befall the like, For where the blind doth leade the blinde, Bothe fall into the dyke. Your kindled neighbours house, May cause you feare youre owne: VVho dreades no harme that maye ensue, Is soonest ouerthrowne. VVherfore consider freendes, That yet liue in delyghtes, How Dogs and Rauens your fathers flesh, Deuoured in your syghtes. Alas, shal euermore Our woes engraued lye, VVith sighes, in brasse and marble stone, The bookes of memorie: VVherein discyphred bee The discordes and the death Of many a noble valiant wight, Too soone bereft of breath Their wydowes mournefull plaintes, Theyr orphanes dolefull teares, VVith cryes of poore exiled soules, Apparantly appeares. There may you viewe with feare, Howe daungerous a thing Ill councell is in tender yeares, To ouerthrow a king. The seas be calme and smoothe VVe dayly see by kynde, No billowe mountes, but by the force Of boysterous stormye wynde. So royall Princes loue, To lyue where vertue is, If Sycophantes or Parasites Enformde them not amisse. Our realme had happie bene, Thou Prince to vertue borne, If that by thy too lyght beleefe, Thy subiects now forlorne, Had neuer felte thy powre VVith sworde and Cannon shot, VVhereby our lande destroyed lies, And famous Fraunce forgot, Yea thy renoume and fame Is buried with the reste, Of Castels, Townes, and battered fortes, VVhiche once a king possest. With these woordes, the Lute fell into hir lappe, and the Ladye crossed hir armes, and tooke breath: then she began to break the silence of all the companie, whiche in admiration remained without mouing, as they had bene enchaunted creatures. At laste, perceyuing euery one beganne to come to themselues, and lyke amazed people beholde one another, moued wyth pitie to see them in this melancholie moode, she chaunged hir sorowfull countenance, like as the sunne shyneth clerely, hauing maistred the shadowe of a darke mistie cloude: then takyng agayne hir Lute, wyth a more mery note she began to sing as foloweth. VVhat pleasaunt Musicke rare, Dothe fill my senses with delightes Proceeding from the ayre? I feele my daselde eies, By leamings lose their light, VVhich farre excell the Sunny beames Or glary morning brighte: The sounde of straunge Consorts, Contents my listening eare, More gallant heauenly harmony On earth may no man heare. I see out of the cloudes, A Virgin doth decline, In Sattyn clad, as white as swan VVith maiestie diuine: Vpon hir heade she beares, A garlande like the grasse, Of Laurell tree, in hewe this Nimph: Dame beauty doth surpasse: Hir countenaunce presents The glorie of the Lorde, In hand she holdes an Olyue braunche, The ensigne of Accorde. But as I doe suppose, This Princesse I do know, VVho nowe forsakes the Heauens aboue, To visite vs belowe: Tis Peace , tis euen the same, VVhome our incessant cries, By earnest sute hath called downe Euen from the starry Skies: VVhere she (O noble dame) Constrainedh was to flye, And keepe hir close, to shunne the force Of VVrath and Tiranny . From whence she did beholde The bloudy furious flame, VVherin all Fraunce consumed is, To our eternall shame: Howe Discorde hatched first The fire of all our feares, Then viewyng our vnhappie state, She shed moste bitter teares: And dyd bewayle our want Of Peace , exilde by spight, Lamenting with a heauie heart, Our sorrowes daye and night. In this our deepe distresse, VVe praide with one consent, Entreating Faithe to be our friende To God omnipotent. He did present our sute, To Christe the virgins sonne, The mediatour of mankinde, By whome our sute was wonne: VVherein we did beseeche, Almightie God to cease His plagues deserued for our sinne, And graunt to vs his peace. Our prayer being hearde By him that seeth all, Presented by his onely sonne, Didde graunt his grace, and calde Necessitie in haste, And did dispatche wyth speede, From Heauen to Earth the Angell rude, To aide vs at our neede: VVhose force and power is suche, Once being out of bande, As nothing liuing in the world Can shunne hys mightie hande. Thou Angell (saide the Lord) Giue eare, this is my minde, Do thou my will vpon the earth, As duty doth thee binde: Goe downe into the worlde, I giue thee perfecte power, To apprehende that bloudy VVarre , VVho doth my flocke deuoure: Abate his cruell pride, And see thou cheyne hym well, Imprison hym in Limbo lake, Among the fiendes of hell. This chardge pronounced, Ioue Did glaunce his eie aside, And did espie the virgin peace, VVho waited but hir tyde: My daughter deare (quoth hee) That haste thy dwelling place Among my Saintes and blessed traine, VVith speede goe shewe thy face, Vnto the toiled troupes, That for thy absence mourne, Plante amitie, and pittie them, That VVarre hath quite forlorne. The Angell and the Maide, No sooner knewe the will Of Ioue , but downe they driue amaine, His pleasure to fulfill, Like as the Arrowe shotte Out of a mightie bowe. From heauen to earth, these messengers Themselues more swiftly throwe: Auoide you souldiers nowe, Oure comforte is in place, Nowe Murther, Theft , and Treason hide Your shamelesse cruell face. Oure happy dayes approche, Oure ioy shall nowe abounde, And peace shall giue vs precious oyle To heale oure mortall wounde: She bringeth Charitie , VVith Concorde, Faith , and Loue , Companions sente for oure reliefe From mightie Ioue aboue: VVith garlandes crowned all Of moste immortall fame, Giue laude therfore with one accorde To hys eternall name. Delay no tyme (oh Fraunce) Be gladde and now reioice, Praise him on high, that hath giuen eare, To thy lamenting voice: Let vs (O people) kneele Before the Lorde of might, And humbly thanke him, sith we finde Suche fauour in his sight, As pleaseth him to sende These Nimphes of heauenly race, To ease our griefe, release our woe, And all our foes deface. Peace hated of the ill, Of God the darling deare, VVe celebrate thy name (O Peace ) In Fraunce with mery cheare: Thy Altar will we builde, And sacrifice will make To thee, of Furie and Disdayne , VVhiche thou doste from vs take. By Heraulds shall thy praise Be blasde in riche aray, And Trumpets shall thy fame resounde, VVhich neuer shall decay. Our weale dothe ryse by thee, For thou by thy puissance, Compellest Fraunce to knowe hir king, And hym to knowe his Fraunce : By thee, the Henries three, To pleasure chaunge their rage, And doth allie their loue anew Vnto their parentage. All bloudy combates cease, All malice doth assuage. Triumphes approche to beautifie A noble mariage. All garnisons departe Our Cities by thy stroke, VVho didde oppresse our Citizen, By force of seruile yoke. Our fieldes are cleere by thee, From all the wicked traine, That haue destroyde our country wealth, And all oure tillmen slaine: VVho to excuse the crime, VVherein they dayly sinne, Alleage the deede that they haue done, Theyr leaders did beginne. By thee the aged man, Shall see his faithfull wyfe, To whome with teares she will vnfolde Hir wearye passed lyfe, And tell what care of mynde His absence did proure, VVhat feare and sorrow day and night For hym she did endure. In recompence of paine, The hoarie headed sire, Renues with looke their auncient ioyes, Reuiued by desire. By thee the Virgins walke The Gardens of delyght, Conducted by their louyng makes, In place of open syght: They trace the pleasant groues, And gather floures sweete, They do appoynte the secrete place Of loue where they muste meete, And sure guages giuen, To keepe the tyme is sette, VVhere wished wedlocke trappeth them VVithin hir ioyfull nette. By thee dame Iustice shall Hir ballance beame redresse, To yelde the wicked their deserte, And aide the comfortlesse. By thee the holy Churche, Shall praye bothe day and nighte, And preache the God of heauen to bee The king of powre and might. The merchaunt shall by thee Applye his Traffike so, As Tauernes shall not him compell His profyte to foreslowe, By thee the pesant poore, VVith trauayle shall begin To sowe, to plante, and till the lande, That long hath barreyn bin, His Corselet of proofe Shall stande hym nowe in steede Vppon a poll to fraye the birdes, That doe destroye his seede: His Morion of defence He vsed for his hatte, Shal serue his wife to put in corne To make his pulleyn fatte. Thou Peace the springing well Of euery happy thing, I can not speake, ne yet conceale The goodnesse thou dost bring: Thou doest reioyce our hearts VVith presence of thy syght, More than the risyng of the Sunne Doth ioye eche earthly wight. VVhose golden glittring beames Dothe chase and put to flighte Dame Sadnesse, Feare , and Drowsinesse , The daughters of the nyght. Thy merrie moode, oh Peace , Doth cause eche thing to growe, VVhose fruite once yelded, thou agayne The same doste ouerthrowe: Thou doste appease the rage And storme on seas and lande, To mitigate the furious force Of heauen, is in thy hande: All seasons, tymes and tydes In thee accord by kynde, The hydeous tempeste in the ende, By Peace a calme dothe fynde. Thou makest euery bird In tyme to buylde their nest, Thou dost ordeyne in craggye rockes A denne for euery beast. The streames of euerye brooke By thee their force appease, By thee the Gallies rowe with ores, Amid the rolling Seas: In fine, eche gifte of grace Proceeding from aboue, Like hony dewe is powrd on vs By concorde, peace , and loue . Oh blessed lucky houre, O happy wished daye, VVherein dissention and despight, By peace are chasde awaye: Goe harbour with the Turke, VVho pufte with pride doth swell, Or packe you to your auncient denne VVith Pluto god of hell. If you on earth will bide To Persia hye with speede, Or Cacebas , whose enuious mindes Your cankerd counsell neede. The realme of Fraunce hath sworne That peace shall be their stay, To whome their hand and harts be giuen For euer to obey: And haue decreed all, That who so breakes his vowe In lewe of his disloyaltie, Shall hang vpon a bough. And he that seemes to lodge Ambition in his minde, The same rewarde, that Amon had, For his deserte shall finde. If any wretche there be, That dare presume to stande Against our crowne and soueraigne peace, VVith force of armed hande. VVe feruently beseeche The thundring God of myght, That all the plagues of heauen and earth Vppon the wretche maye lyght, That furye freate his gall, His payne may neuer cease, Ne fynde no friende in his distresse, That may his woe release. After the auncient Lady had finished hir song, the reste remained in a maruellous extasie, vntill Sire Bel Acueil breaking silence, whiche he supposed to continue too long, in so good company, began to say: Surely Madam, you haue sufficiently shewed what puissaunce the delectable melodie of youre deuine voice hath ouer humaine creatures, entreating them in suche order, as wyth one breathe you enforce them bothe to reioyce and lament. Whereof oure eyes are euident witnesses, euen nowe bathed in the teares of compassion, and presentlye dryed wyth the handkercher of consolation. So as oure myndes rauished by the delightes of oure eares, hathe entirely vnited vs to the harmony of youre Lute: the whyche you haue conningly handled with suche seuerall deuisions, as it pleased youre nimble fyngers to recorde vppon the warbling strings. Thys compelleth me to omitte all maruaile howe Orpheus and Amphion , by their musicke gaue life to insensible bodies, sith you haue the power to render lyuing soules insensible, the vse of hearing onely excepted. In myne opinion (replied Sire Fleur Damour ) the greatest miracle I haue here noted, is not the authoritie whiche the melodious song of my Ladye hathe hadde ouer oure spirites, but the straighte brideling of our tongues, and principally of these Damoysels, who by meanes thereof hadde very large occasion to breake vppon vs, and accuse vs, as culpable of all these mischiefes, seeing that menne haue begunne the warres, and that by women the peace is established, especially by the moste excellent mariage of oure Kyng, so as oure ryghte vertuous Queene gyueth vs iuste occasion to saye, that oute of Germany issued the warre, or at the leaste the warriours, and from thence also sprang the peace. Wherevnto Maistresse Mary aunswered, you haue preuented a mischiefe in speaking before you were desired, for beyng in daunger to receiue a venny at my hande, you haue auoyded the same in striking your selfe. Tushe, tushe, quoth Sire Firme Foy , althoughe the remembraunce of endured calamities reioyceth those that are escaped, I am of opinion, that as we haue laide aside oure weapons, so to mortifie therewyth all memorye and talke of warres, seeing that not onelye the reason and lawe of Obliuion of iniuryes, but also the tyme and place prouoketh vs to be merye, and to bee reuenged vppon oure passed myseryes, wyth the arrerages of Pleasure so long tyme forborne. I pray God I dye, sayde Maistresse Margaret , but youre counsayle is verye good: And for my parte I will subscribe willinglye thervnto, consyderyng you are not heere among youre enimyes, whose crueltye you neede to doubt, but in the company of maidens, vnto whome the onelye reporte of Warre is fearefull and horryble. Ah maistresse (aunswered Sire Firme Foy ) howe differente youre talke is (pardon mee thoughe I saye so) from reason, in that you affyrme vs to bee free, beeyng in moste imminent daunger, hauing greatest occasion to stande vppon oure guarde, not onely for that (as the wiseman saythe) mistruste is the roote of Wisedome, but forasmuche as not long sithence the tyme caryed feare of warre engraued in hir foreheade, proclaymyng nothing but crueltie, and the name of enimy rise in all mennes mouthes, warnyng eche one to prouyde for theyr owne safegarde, in aide whereof the Sentinels and Scowtes were oure greate helpe, whose continuall watche saued vs from beeyng assayled vnwares. Moreouer, the Trumpets aduertysed the approche and commyng of the Ennimye, and called vs to armes, by theyr trustye warnyng. But (O GOD) nowe the season whyche doeth testifye Peace, and the name of maydens, whiche promiseth but loue and fauoure, besides the wantes we haue of good espials to aduertise vs, and of sure rampires to defend vs, enforceth vs vnarmed to fall into the arrogante puissaunce of these cruell friends, who lying in ambushe to entrappe vs vnprouided, againste the truce they promise vs by their gracious countenaunce, seduce vs lyke as the flame of the candle deceyueth the credulous flye. Thus exercising with rigor their insolent victory, they entreate theyr friends more hardly than their mortall enimies, contented with no ransome, but only life. Alas Sir (answered maistres Margaret ) what causeth you to make your selfe certain of ye thing, wherof you haue so small assuraunce? It appeareth your opinion is founded but of fantasie, and that you speake but of hearesay, or vpon euill will, whiche moueth you at pleasure to be so lauishe of your words: thanks be to God, your fresh colour and good liking testifieth, that melancholy consumeth not your body, althoughe your tongue complaine without cause, whiche are euident proofes of manifest veritie. Wherfore I pray you remember, that sinne against conscience is frustrate of remission, notwithstanding by especiall grace you may receiue absolution, so that you will repente your error from the bottome of your hart. Alas maistresse, replied Sire Firme Foy , if the dinte of a stroke breake a sworde, and blemishe not the scabbarde, or a wrenche breake a bone without perishing the fleshe or skinne whiche couereth it, then is it not straunge, that your soueraigne beauties to shewe their puissaunce to supporte no lesse force, delighteth to slay the minde without hurting the body, which you esteeme too vile to receiue the markes of your power, by which meanes you neede not iudge it noueltie, thoughe. I harbour a sorrowfull harte vnder a pleasaunt countenaunce. If you see my shoe new and well shaped, yet doe you not knowe where it pincheth my foote. Euen so, though I looke merily, you know not (alas to my paine) where my griefe is. You are abused in this similitude (saide maistresse Mary ) thinking thereby to couer your error: for assaying a new shoe in the shomakers shop, if it fit you not well, you are in place where you may change it at your pleasure, the which you cannot do, if you haue paid for the paire  & worne the, then muste you stande to the losse, and be thought vnwise in bestowing youre mony vppon the thyng will do you no seruice. So louers haue no cause to coplaine, for somuche as if they feele themselues euill entreated, by loue they are vppon their feete ready to seeke further, hauing libertie to remedy their griefe, and to comforte themselues in making exchange, but this priuiledge is abrogated from suche as are linked to loyaltie by the lawes and stricte bandes of matrimonie. Wherefore this not hindring you freely to cofesse your fault, call to remembrance, yt to offend is humaine, to repent diuine, and to perseuere diuelish. Wherevnto Sire bel Acoeul (smiling) answered, it seemeth (maistresse) by your speache, that loue is but a sporte for babes, or pathes of pleasure, whiche are conceyued and extinguished by the appetites of wandring affections. But if you knewe with howe strong and Diamantine cheynes louers be bounde (more surely fastened, than to a firme rocke) as Vulcans nette doth verifye, you woulde not speake so liberally, but woulde with pitie lament their estate, (worse than the vncertaine stay of Searouers) rather than make so light accompt thereof, and woulde measure oure ardent affections with your owne metwande. As thoughe dame nature had enlarged to men the preeminence, and credite which vnder pardon and particular prerogatiue, she hath graunted to virgins (in respect of their sexe feminine, wherof she is participate) so dispensing with them, as they are cleare from any passion of mind, except perhaps of the pleasure they receiue to torment men, exercising vppon vs (as the wise man sayth) a delectable tiranny. So it is Sir, aunswered the Gentlewoman, althoughe the wordes I haue vttered, do not a little greeue mee, neuerthelesse I may not gainesay them, being grounded vppon reasons whiche enforce me to maintaine my opinion. Wherefore (I pray you) doe Poets, and Painters resemble the loue of men, to an infant hauing wings, and doe painte the loue of women in the shape of a Tortois lying vnder Venus feete? but only to testifye the loue of men to be voluble and vnconstant lyke a birde, and the loue of women firme and stedfast, like the sluggish Tortois: Wherin they haue greate reason, seeing that Historiens in their discourses entreate seldome of the disloialtie of women, but wee heare and reade in infinite volumes, howe their bounty and simplicitie hath continually bin deceiued by the malice of their periured and changeable louers: Whereof in maner al the most victorious and famous personages of old time are witnesses, so as throughout all ages the faithlesse Jason, Theseus, Demophon, Aeneas , and Hercules , are examples of certaine proofe that the loue of men is wandering. And althoughe their worthye actes be defyled with the blottes of this infamie, yet are they notwithstandyng placed among the Gods, yea and their starres honoured, and reported to surmounte all others in clearenesse. The occasion wherefore auncient decrees haue licenced this crime in men,  & so straightly forbidden it in women, the same is, bycause the Lawes haue bene ordeyned and established by men: but that which spighteth me moste, is to viewe this vice so to enlarge his seigniorie, as the libertie whiche in times paste was onely permitted to Princes, at this daye is common to euery priuate person, so that nowe a dayes there is none so verye a wretche, who aduaunceth not his disloyaltie with such triumph as if he had obteined some glorious conquest with the ryotous disburssing the honour of suche as considering theyr owne offence, they are bounde to preserue and defende more dearely than their proper life. But alas, as hee that desyreth to be notorious, when hee can not aspire therevnto by any vertuous acte, doeth prosecute his intente by mischiefe, and setteth on fyre the Temple of Dia ña , or committeth some other villanous facte: euen so we dayly beholde the heires of our age, seeke to make their liues famous in defaming a great number of women. This wickednesse hath not onely place in vndiscrete loue, or (as I may more aptly terme it) in wanton disordinate lust, but euen in mariage it selfe, the faith and promise whereof ought to be so holy and inuiolable, as the band thereof is straight and permanent. Oh what coniunction or companie may be founde more sure than the vnion of two? The saying of of the wyse blynde Prophet commeth to my remembrance, who affirmed, that his mother Venus hath not power to vnite their harts togither, declaring therby, that the amitie of wedlock receiueth not a third copartener, whervnto neuerthelesse the peruersnesse of this world will constrayne it. And I feare, the longer we liue, the worse it will be, not onely bycause the world is diminished from an empire to a kingdom, and our ages conuerted from golde into yron, but for that in tymes past before the matche was made, whiche is perdurable, men were carefull and inquisitiue of the behauiour and condition of suche parties as they ment to marrie, of their stock and education, and before any agreement passed, they wold eate a bushell of salt togither, and winter and sommer eche other, and as the French prouerbe saith ( assembler les troys estates ) yet after all these scrupulous misteries, and the obseruation of diuers ceremonies, they wer commonly deceyued, and trauelled not farre before they repented their enterprised voiage. Nowe to perswade men to take aduisement in choosing, to laye their hande on their harte beefore theyr lips consent, and to enter leisurely into suche waighty affaires the Tortois was painted vnder Venus feet, and hir husband Vulcan pictured lame. But now adays women are no sooner seene in ye streats but by one or other they ar courted for mariage, wtout any enquirie but for welth,  & as ye match is made for VVhat haue you? so al other things deped vpon VVhat will you giue me? in such wise, as vertue is despised & amitie vtterly decaied, which resolueth me, yt in these sodaine contracts after frequentation, shal ensue knowlege ye one of the other. And this knowlege (their estates not coseting both parties) wil breed disdain, disquiet in house, & in the end disquiet wil procure deuorce, & thus vniuersally are these mony mariages finished. Euen as ye flame of kindled straw is feruet but for a blast, or ye plants that beareth fruit very yong naturally endure not many yeres, & as a picture graue in wax is easily defaced, eue so these loues so quickly reuiued, are as sodainly mortified. Whervnto Sire Fleur d'Amour answered, I cofesse mistresse, yt your sayings are fouded vpon ye very truth, but wil you attribut these soden mariages only to ye lightnes of me, as thogh they alone procured ye same. Rather to excuse in this behalf both the man and the woman, we will deuide the blame equally betwixte them: Let vs consider I praye you, howe nature hathe not vrged hir creatures of late dayes by secrete inclination to communicate in their kinde, but that the same hathe bene from the beginning, so as all liuing things seeing their essence to bee but mortall desire (according to the generall law graued in their hartes in their originall) to resiste their corruption, and haue no other mean to remedy this blemish, but in coupling themselues, engendring as the instincte of nature hath instructed them, whiche is the onely occasion that maketh man after his deathe to liue in his children. And we haue so greate care to perpetuate our ofsprings in this manner, as the more we decaye, the more desire we haue to restore and multiplie oure progenies: Lyke vnto the heade of Hidra , whiche smitten from the body, immediatly dothe regenerate seauen other in place thereof. Likewise wee see for one braunche of a tree stued off, that nature planteth seauen scients vppon the same stocke: yea if the body of a tree receiue by any ma the stroke of an axe, out of the carse will spring yong twigges, which seeme not only to be the salue of the woundes receyued, but a reuenge agaynste the toole, whiche hathe presumed to outrage nature. The same desire of reuenge is also among men: whiche was the occasion that after the desolation of the deluge, and the famine, and captiuitie of Pharao , the people encreased and multiplied in so greate foyson: whereto I coulde alleadge the notable destructions of the Romaines, and so many other examples, as a greate volume woulde scarcely containe, wherein nature hathe shewed hir wisedome. And it is doubtfull whether the lawes of Manumission to suche as maried and begatte children for the mayntaynaunce of the common wealth, were not established by hir. The laste care of capitaine Leonidus prepared to battell against the Persians without hope of returne, was to perswade his wife to take no farther thought, but to get an other husbande, who might restore the hindraunce she receiued by forbearing of his company: it is then greate reason after the warre (wherein so many couples are separated, that they whiche remaine prouoked by this secrete lawe of nature, are so hastie and forward to recouer  & repaire the losses of the worlde. Wherefore I muste commend them, whom you doe blame, allowing the opinion of prudent Licurgus , who by his statutes condemned the single life and aduaunced suche as had bene longest maried into the moste honorable dignities, as principall magistrates in tyme paste. Nowe Maistresse to the fyrste poynte, and touching that you affirme that these mariages so rashly attempted, cannot long continue firme and durable: Let vs conclude I pray you to search the originall foundatio from whence the faulte proceedeth: you muste needes confesse, that good and precious thinges are alwayes rarest to finde, we dayly see greater store of Flints, than of Diamants: so men at this day, whose number are but fewe and rare as pearles, muste needes be good, the euil being all consumed in oure late furious warres. Seing then the good decayeth not, whiche if it were otherwise, no good shoulde remain: I conclude that the small number of men of our age being good, ca neuer violate mariage, but necessarily it must proceede from women, whose multitude being greater muste Ergo be worse. O the vertue of God replied the Lady, say you so? you that are towardes mariage shoulde vse youre wordes more discretely vntill your prouision were furnished, for (quoth she, beholding the other two) it is as vnpossible for you to liue without wiues, as for blinde men to walke without guides. Cal to remembraunce what punishement Orpheus endured for the like offence, who perhaps spake not so largely, as you haue done. But I perceiue you vse the trade of suttle marchants, who euer dispraise the wares they determine to buy, to the ende they may bargaine at their owne price. Under correction Madam (answered Sire Fleur Damour ) I am content to paye for euerything according to the worth, yet for my parte I esteeme one beautie of so greate valure, as if I might obtaine it with any honourable death, I woulde thinke I had gained the same very good cheape. And to the ende I may perswade you, that affection blindeth me not in this behalfe, I beseeche you madame, and also this fauorable companie, to licence one in your presence, not only to approue the Loue of wome to be more variable  & vndiscrete, than the loue of men (whiche with small trauaile I trust to confirme) by so probable reasons, as shall not bee repugnable, excepte you will demaunde torche-light at highe noone: But also to bee the causes of all the misfortunes, whiche constraineth louers so to lament their hard mishaps, as from their sorrowful eyes, flouds of teares doe flowe sufficient to drowne the rigor of Damoysels, the whiche I truste to make you acknowlege by the briefe discourse of a piteous and memorable Historie: whiche is this. At these wordes the whole assistaunce approched, and placed themselues rounde about this gallant preacher, who hauing taken breathe, began on this manner. Such as haue imparted their trauailes in reading, or at the leaste, haue but hearde speake of auncient Histories, maye easely coniecture, that Greece hath alwaies bin replenished, not onely with noble, valiant, and wise personages: but if they consider well the discourses of the Grecian Chroniclers, shall finde the same region, hath bin no lesse fortunate in the production of women: for somuche as the greatest number of Dames and Damoysels, whose beauties haue deserued preheminence in the mouths of Historiens, haue bin bred, borne, & brought vp, in the said famous Monarchy of Greece : In whose glorious Portes, to this day, is celebrated the renowne of famous Queene Hellaine , in commendation of whose excellet beautie the trumpets of the famous Poets doe yet sounde. But I dare affirme, that shee of whom I mean to speake, shall honor hir country much more by hir vertuous life: who being nothing inferior to Paris Paragon in beautie, surmounteth hir exceedingly in bounty, apparantly testifying by hir soueraigne vertues, that the graces  & perfections wherwith nature had richly endued hir, wer worthily emploied. This Damoisell of whom my discourse shall determine, was borne in the Isle of Rhodes , discended of the moste honorable family in the whole country, educated in all good nourture, as boutifully as might possibly be desired, who assoone as she grewe to the knowledge of good and euill, fell in liking of the behauioure and courtesie of a yong stripling, borne likewise in the same city, so accomplished in all perfections of Nature, as by due deserte, he was fancied of this beautifull minion, and battered the firste breath in hir tender hearte, who with the onely glaunces of hir alluring eie, was able to mollify the moste saluage and indurate fantasies bearing life. The Damoysell (Gentlewomen) was named Persida , and hir yong friende Erastus , vnto whome, hys father and mother newly deceassed, had left abudance of wealth, and by their laste Testament, bequeathed the gouernaunce and education of this Orphane vnto his vncle, who by good aduenture, was neyghbour vnto the faire Persida , wherby these yonglings ordinary frequented company. By meanes wherof, such friendly familiaritie was confirmed on bothe partes, as from their tender youth, they delight to play togither, and continually embrace and kisse eche other (a Prognostication of the future coniunction of such perfect gifts, wherewith they were bothe liberally fraughted by diuine influece.) This couple, as they grew in age, so encreased their beautie and comlinesse, like the rose buddes, which in the hart of the spring sprout and spread abroad their beautiful blossoms. And with their bodies likewise encreased and augmented their new conceiued loue, like vnto the yong Uine, which embraceth the tender Elme, whervnto it is so firmly vnited by their mutuall growth, as in fine they are incorporate togither. Thus in their tender yeres the parents and friendes on both parties conceiued a secrete hope, that destiny would confirme a match betwixt this likely couple, whose equall perfections commended of al men, gaue them cause to expect a happy successe, for the which there was none, but wished ernestly. And I suppose if eche mans opinio might haue take place, these two creatures had bin accopted ye ofspring of Angels: but the heaues wold not permit a Paradise on earth. These louers had now attained, the man, the age of .xv. yeres,  & the maiden .x. but to view their growth, common iudgement wold haue attributed to eche three yeares of aduantage. So as they attended onely the expiring of such tyme, as might minister occasion, to render the fruit of their desired mariage with no lesse good will, than the childe vnder tuition of a shrewde Tutor, wisheth the stature of a man to escape the rod. And in establishement of this bargaine Erastus embrasing and kissing his Persida , gaue hir a iewell, wherein was a Diamante and an Emeralde, so singularlye cutte and cunningly coupled togyther, as they were not to bee discerned other than one entier stone, besides the excellencie of the workemanship farre exceeded the value of the precious substaunce: Requiring his beloued maistresse, in beholding this gage of hys good wil, alwayes to resemble in loue the Emeralde, which doth rather cracke than consente to any disloyaltie: promising for hys parte, euer to be like the Diamante, whiche throughe constante and decreed stedfastnesse, sooner breaketh vnder the toole, than endureth any newe shape, so muche the nature thereof abhorreth exchaunge. Persida receyued this token and pledge of Erastus his ardent and sincere affections, wyth exceeding contentation and pleasure, beseeching God by hys diuine prouidence, so to prosper their lucky beginning, as there might ensue so stricte alliaunce, and perfecte loue betwixte them in the worlde, as in the Iewell giuen and receyued were vnited vnseparablye, two of the richest and moste beautifull stones of the Orient. But bycause she woulde neither remayne indebted to hir louer in courtesie or good will: she requited him wyth the gifte of a Chaine, the linkes whereof were enterlaced with pearle and stone of diuers coloures exceeding cunningly. In presenting wherof, she deliuered an amorous kisse with feruent affection, and saide: I pray God my friende, that wee may continue togither linked in the chayne of wedlocke, so manye yeares, as there are seuerall linkes in this chaine, with as faithfull loyaltie as is represented by the golde therein, and so great estimation, as is in these pearles comprehended, requiring you to keepe this token for the loue of hir, who euermore reserueth a roomth for you in the secreate chamber of hir loyall harte. In these amorous paths our two louers walked long at their plesure with wonderful cotentment. But alas, Fortune, the enimie of all good hap, was contrarie to this blessed conclusion, which giueth vs large occasion to complayn our mundain miseries, by whose wicked ordinances we are subiect to such sodein alterations, as when we think our selues in moste permanent pleasures, our good houre is by fickle Fortune cut short in a moment: yet not conteted herewith hir malice is suche towards mankinde, as she constraineth men oftentimes to tast within hir sugred cup, the bitter liquour that procureth their destruction. Thus vnder colour of amitie, shee wreaketh hir malicious enuie vppon vs, euen as the Fisher encloseth his deadly hooke in the pleasant baite, to the ende the simple fishe mistrusting no guyle, may vnwares swallow his bane. Alas, what ioyes may be exspected in this world, sith frowarde Fortune prepared suche abundance of calamities to these innocet louers, whose merits deserued euerlasting felicitie: Ah beautiful chayn, ye sure pledge of loue, predestined to procure so great dysaster, of righte thou deseruest to be compared vnto the dolorous gift which Aiax preseted vnto Hector. Erastus dere dames, hauyng receyued this commendable chayne, knewe not what countenance to shewe, so much he was contented therwith, considering the place from whence it came: neither coulde he detaine his eye from it, but embracing and kissing it continually, remayned as one rauished with ioy. The terme of ten moneths exspired (during which tyme Erastus had enioyed this iewell, the whiche he had preserued as carefully as the Apple of his eye,) it fortuned a great lord of the Citie, did marrie his daughter vnto the Prince of Cyprus , and for the honorable solemnizing of thys princely wedding, great preparation was made of stage plays, bonfyres, Maskes, Justes, Turneys, wrastlings, and other infinite pastymes, with suche continuall feastings, as the people repaired out of all countreys adioyning, by the bruite and reporte of the great and sumptuous magnificence which was to bee seene at Rhodes , where (among others) a great number of the knights of Latran , whyche we call at thys day the Knyghtes of Malta , were assembled. All whiche, withoute pretence of malice, endeuored at thys feaste to shewe theyr valour, and to engraue some notable token of theyr prowesse in the memories of so greate a multitude. It happened one day while these sportes endured, the listes and barres being pestred with the presse of people, and the scaffoldes chardged with Ladies and Damoisels, euen as the Iustes beganne, there entred into the fielde, a Knight armed at al points in a greene armor, mounted vpon a mightie Sirian courser, caparissoned in like manner, who with braue mannages, cariers, boundes, and tournes, made the duste aboute him flee into the ayre, and there folowed him an Esquier disguised, gallopping a maine: all the troupe were amazed at the fierce approche of this Champion, who with couragious countenance, forsooke the barres, and leapte into the listes, bearing vppon his helmet, a white Pennante, deliuering by his actes, so greate estimation of his valour, as there was no Damoysell that longed not to vnderstande what hee was, nor Knight, which feruently desired not to experiment his force: whiche diuers more hastie, than wise, approued to their harmes. For this warriour handled hys horse with suche agilitie, and encountred his aduersaries so firmely at the counterbuffe, as no course escaped hym wythout the subuersion of a Knighte to the earthe, not couching hys launce in vaine all the whole daye. Thus hauyng vnhorsed a number of the moste experte in feates of armes, the reste committing no great confidence to their cunning, were easyly perswaded. So that in fine, not one approched to shewe hym sporte, whych greeued muche the whole assistaunce, whose eies were fixed vppon this new miracle, supposing the Knighte to bee some Spirite of Maugis , or some of the race of Amadis , or Rowland , with the golden launce of Bradamant , or god Mars himselfe. The trumpettes nowe beganne to sounde the retreate, when the valiant Phillip of Villiers , at that time great commaunder of Rhodes , disdaining to beholde his Knights so faintly disarsoned, in whome hee reposed the opinion of singular prowesse, made choise of a greate and mightie launce, and taking his beuer, wythout anye defiaunce tooke his course towardes the Conquerour, who was not vnprouided to receiue him. The encounter of these Champions resembled the brush of a mightie billow, beating vpon a craggy cliffe, or the coniunctio of two clouds of contrary Elements breaking into some thunder cracke, for the force of their meeting: was so furious, as by the iudgement of the beholders, one stroke had finished the combat and liues of two so perfect warriours, if their launces had bin as forcible as their bodies: but at the ioyning they flew in trunchions, and shiuered euen to their hands. Then the Knight vnknowen lifting vp his eies, beholding hir vpon the scaffold, or whome his minde endured a more perilous combat, receiued such comforte by the fauor of hir pittiful countenance, as taking a newe launce from his Esquier, he broched his courser with the spurres, and setting his teeth wyth a couragious despight, couched his staffe so luckily, as the Commaundeur failing his attainte, himselfe being hitte, was enforced to auoide hys saddle: wherof the good olde Knight somewhat ashamed, wyth a loude voice, pronounced these wordes: Sir Knight, I see well youre prowesse shall finde small resistaunce in this country, sith it may not be counteruailed in our company, wherein is assembled the floure of Knighthoode: Notwithstanding I require you, if you retaine as greate courtesie, as valiantnesse, that we may entreate at your hands in recompence of the shame we haue receyued, to vnderstande what you are, to the ende, that both you may enioy the due honour you haue thys day deserued, and wee the contentment we shal obtain in knowing your name: but the Knight bending his bodie vnto ye Commaundeur , whispered in his eare, beseeching him of pardon, for that he was not willing to be knowen. By this time ye night began to couer the Elemet wyth hir brown mantell, and the people al maruelling at the wonderfull Chiualry they had viewed, be their crowsing noyse, sygnifyed theyr departure, when as all estates moued wyth exceeding desire, to knowe the Champion (nowe prepared to departe) came clustering about him in heapes, whiche caused him for reuerece sake to dismout himselfe. The the Bridegrome, for whose honoure these triumphs were celebrated, claspyng hym aboute the necke saide: Iesu Sir Knight, wherefore are you displeased with the commendation and honour whych you shal acquire by the discouerture of your face:  & therewyth seazing vpon the hinder skirt of his helmet wyth an ardet boldnes, drew it so rudely, or rather happily towards him, as the latchets and buckles slipping, he openly discouered the bare heade of our Rhodian Erastus , who besides his naturall beautie, painted hys cheekes wyth a certain shamefastnesse, like one in a maske or mummerie, whose vizarde sodaynely falleth from hys face in the companye, from whence he woulde departe vnknowne: furthermore his golden lockes curled with the dewe of his long trauaile, aduaunced his countenaunce with suche a comely grace, as if his prowesse gained the price and reputation among the knightes, nowe hee obtained no lesse fauor among dame beauties minions, vnto whom this gracious visage was immediately knowne, but especiallye vnto the faire Persida , who with extreme ioy hadde sounded, if the escape of hir gallant friend from daunger of so many blowes receiued that day, had not tempered hir motion, waying ioy and feare in one ballaunce with equall counterpaise. Al the knights behelde Erastus , like men astonied, without vtteraunce of anye word, vntill Monsieur Phillip smiling began to saye, by the faith I owe to knighthoode, we haue to our greate honour desired the viewe of this amiable face, and may nowe aduaunt our winning with shame inough, being all ouerthrowen by this young stripling, who hath receiued vs with like entertainment. Thus speaking, he embraced the knight, blessing the houre of his birth, and the hand that so well employed the order of knighthoode, wherevnto (with a smiling countenaunce) Erastus answered: My lords, I haue greate cause to accompte this daye fortunate vnto me, wherein I haue gotten credite to proue my feeble force againste such personages as haue left the glorious markes of their valor and chiualry in so many perillous encounters of straunge countreis, vouchsafing to vse in my behalfe ye fauour of a maister of Defence towardes his prentise. I hoped the disguising of my visage, shuld haue serued for a curtain to couer my rude experiece: but sith it hath pleased suche an honourable company to depriue me therof, at the least I beseeche you, my youthe maye excuse my presumption, and supplye the maske which you haue reaued from me. In doing wherof, you shall bynde me with the vttermoste of my seruice to acknowledge the honoure and curtesye, whereby I remayne continually at youre commaundementes. His tale ended, whylest euery man disarmed them, to receyue the freshe ayre, Erastus leaped lightly vpon the skaffolde, where after the entertaynement of a thousande embracings among the Ladyes and damoysels, at length he approched his Persida , vnto whome (louingly clasping hir white delicate hande) softly in hir eare he sayd: Deare Mistresse, if I haue this daye deserued any commendation among the professors of faith, I auowe the same bounden to doe homage and fealtie vnto your beautie, whiche by a fauorable aspect, hath moste fortunately conducted me to atchieue the vnexspected ende of this enterprise: It is therfore good reason, I shoulde render thankes vnto your beautiful eies, which by their rigorous fauour hath with one glance rendred me both victorious & vanquished. Euen as Persida was prest to be reuenged, all the Lordes, Knights, and gentlemen in courtly order, conducted their conquerour with greate triumph vnto the pallaice of the Lorde Philochrise father vnto the bride, and that man thoughte hymselfe happy, and greatly honoured, that might carry either the launce, shielde or helmet of Erastus . So as for that time Persida coulde not aunswere hym, but onely by hir eye. All the company being arriued at the feast, the cheare was suche, as was requisite to entertaine the Kings of Persia : During whiche season no talke was ministred, but of the prowesse, courtesie, comlinesse,  & good behauior of the greene knight, who in dauncing and other disportes, abridged in no pointe the greate reputation he had gotten, giuing all the aspectants suche pleasure to see him demeane himselfe so lustily & gallantly after his great toile taken the day before, as they passed the most part of ye night without regard of any rest. Who wold not haue our greene knight as prosperous in good hap and felicitie, as his hart coulde possibly wishe: yea, who would not haue called this daye the moste fortunate for him of all the dayes of hys lyfe, wherin he liued with greater contentation, than Diton or Sibilla . But alas it fell out quite contrary to his exspectation: for Fortune a continuall stepmother to suche, as she aduaunceth, determined to present the principall personage in this tragedie, and the better to shewe the force of hir puissaunce, shee sette hir proude foote so rudelye agaynste thys beautifull foundation of Loue, that shee subuerted so muche of the worke, as was raised, makyng thys dayes trauaile, the moste vnfortunate for the poore gentleman, that euer could happen vnto him: (so greate deceyte and ficklenesse remayneth in hir mundayne wheele. The spring of the daye no sooner beganne to chase awaye darkenesse from the face of the Earth, but the people hied to place themselues vppon the Sea shoare, where they myghte wyth moste easye and greatest pleasure, beholde the sportes prouyded for that daye. When all the troupes were assembled, the peace perchyng on tiptoe, dispersed their wanderyng eyes, to seeke the gentle Erastus , who not founde, after diligent enquirie, it was certified that hee was departed sicke into the countrey verye early in the mornyng. Then althoughe thys Eclipse contented no manne, yet was hys excuse easylye coyned, and the cause of hys disease referred to the excessiue trauaile he hadde endured the daye passed. But oure Persida , pinched wyth the panges of Loue, could take this excuse for no payment of hir particular interest: so as shee woulde willingly haue plaied the Poste, to vnderstande the occasion of his soddayne departure, if Agatha hir Chamber maid hadde not detained hir from this intent, perswading hir what blemishe it shoulde bee to hir honoure, bothe to departe the noble company of Ladies and Damoysells so vndiscreetely, and also by haste to discouer hir loue, whyche other maydens seeke by al meanes to conceale, assuring hir maistresse of Erastus health, and that hys wisedome in so doing was verye commendable, to the ende it might appeare by hys absence, howe greately his presence was esteemed. Verye well (saide shee) I will credite thy wordes, but if thou deceiuest mee, I praye God thou maiste possesse the plagues of Loue. Thus was the Damoysell perswaded, so as hir griefe seemed outwardlye but small, bycause she was to keepe open companye. But alas to whome coulde it appeare greate, not being knowne to anye witnesse? But thys patient, who fearing it should bee perceiued, conceyued the same so couertly from the manifeste viewe of the worlde, as shee concealed hir anguishe in the bottome of hir bosome. Now to shew you the occasion of this sodayne departure, you shall vnderstande: Oure Knight hauing aboute hys necke, the iewell he loued so dearely, wythout the whyche he woulde neyther walke, eate, nor sleepe, esteeming the same the onely originall of hys delightes, rendring him a perpetuall remembraunce of hir presence, who was the onely maistresse of his affections: It happened by greate mischaunce, the bridegrome plucking awaye his helmet (as I tolde you) cutte the chayne in peeces with the gorget of Erastus armoure, who being discouered (cotrary to his intent) was presently disarmed, so wonderfully rauished in delectation of the greate glorye hee receyued among so manye estates, as he perceiued not when the chaine slipped from him, being likewise so thronged with the presse (which greate desire vrged to beholde him) as he coulde not heare it fall, the place being paued with harde grauell, from whence he was caried triumphantly, so beside himselfe with extreame ioy, as hee perceiued not his losse. But alas, his mishap triumphed ouer his good fortune, as it was euident. In the euening when he vnarrayed himselfe to bedwarde, and missed his chaine, which caused him to passe the nighte in complainte of hys disaster, hee calling to remembraunce the wordes his maistresse spake, when shee gaue the same vnto hym, his harte died with sorrowe: on the other side respecting his owne innocencie in losing it, he was constrained to excuse himselfe, so that he could impute no faulte, but onely in his traiterous fortune, which againste all equitie, raunsomed so shorte ease, with continuall griefe, Grief (said he) whiche shall accompany me vnto my dolorous death, whych cannot be far from my expectation: for with what countenaunce dare I shewe my selfe in the presence of my louyng Persida , hauyng so reckeleslye loste the iewell I oughte to haue preserued more dearely than my life. Oh if the heauens had so much fauored me, as I might haue receiued my deadly woud so ofte, as I couched my speare that vnhappy day I would haue esteemed mine estate blessed, dying in possession of the inestimable gifte presented by the fauourable grace of my deare Maistresse, and louyng friende, who might by my death haue hadde certaine testimonye of myne amorous duetie, where as now my disloyaltie can find no exccuse, and my fault lesse amedment or reparation: for who hauing founde a Iewell of suche value, will be so foolishe to restore it? But alas, shall my default bereaue my ioyes for euer? Why doe I then desire life, to liue in perpetual annoy? In these alterations, the poore Louer wyth a troubled minde turmoiled his wery carcasse from place to place, and distraught of all reason, soughte his sworde to reuenge hys disaster vppon his comely personage, and to separate good happe yoked to the cruell pastime of fortune: but guyded onely by blinde fury, when he was risen from his bedde, hee knewe not whether to reele, for the lightnesse of hys braine, intoxicated with sundry fantasies, made him stagger like one labouring in a burning feuer, or as a man dizzie with the waltering of a vessel, tossed by the hollowe waues of raging seas, so as in seeking the dore, he happened vpon the windowe, and supposing to bee at the beddes feete, hee clasped vppon the bolster. Thus gropyng long in vaine, to fynde the thyng he soughte, at laste hee threwe hymselfe vppon a benche, crossing his languishing armes vpon his wofull breast and saide: Oh lingering death, why takest thou pleasure in my mischiefe? shalte thou be the fatter to deuoure me leane and dryed with sorowe? Alas to what misery wilt thou yet reserue mee? the worlde flyeth thee, and thou pursuest the worlde. But as the Hunter, who pleasureth not to take the yelding pray, thou shunnest me, that seeketh thee in great necessitie, yea thou art alwaies deafe to those, that incessauntlye implore thine aide. Ah blinde bayarde, thou seest no more what is needeful to be done, than fortune, who is concluded wyth thee to worke my vtter ruine. I knowe you are conspired togither, but perhappes the one of you shall deceiue the other, and disaster shall lose the Interest he hopeth to haue in me. Pronouncing these wordes, hee fell by little and little into a colde sweate, the whiche through the chargeable burthen of hys intollerable tormentes, encreased a deaw ouer all his body, so as hys limmes possessed wyth a mortall agonie, constrayned hym to drawe hys breathe verye painefullye. Neuerthelesse by the succoure of hys good Aungell, hys Spirytes retournyng vnto hym (as a horse broken loose and brought agayne into the stable) he began to renew his tempestuous turmoyles. Oh senselesse creature, said he, why do I confesse my self culpable in wishing vndeserued death, as though there were no other remedie? Oh foole, why accompte I my selfe vnfortunate sith euery man esteemeth me happie? what moueth me thus to be enimy to my selfe? I haue lost a thing very deare vnto me, shall I therefore dispaire to recouer it, seing the fauour I haue obteined of al men? what if I can heare no newes of my Iewel, shal I therfore coniecture so great rancour to gouerne the creature in whome I coulde neuer perceiue but lenitie and pittie? shall I feare to be frustrate of pardon, and banished hir presence for one misfortune the which I could not auoyde? Thus the miserable Erastus taking both courage and counsel, dispatched hys seruant Pistan (whose trustinesse and fidelitye he had so often proued, as he durste haue committed his life to his credite, willing him to make searche and diligente enquirie to vnderstande who had found his chayne, but alas all was in vayne, for the cheyne happened into the hande of a Gentleman of the town (companio of our Martyre) who sought the good wil of a coutrey Damosel, neighbor vnto the Lordship of Erastus , vnto who this amorous esquire presently sent this chaine for a toke. Immediately after, there was a feast in the towne, at the which, this countrey Damosel named Lucina , (who customablie neuer escaped any) was presente, forgetting nothing in hir closet that might adorne hir person, or augmente hir naturall beautie. God knoweth if the chayne were hydde in hir pocket, but whersoeuer it was Persida espied it, whose rolling eyes glaunced in euery corner like the haggard Falcon, whose eye serueth for a sentinell, whilest shee pruneth hir plumage in the sunne Persida , perceyuing a stranger beautified in hir feathers, grew in such choller, as fearing least hir countenaunce shoulde bewraye the disquiet of hyr mynde, she forsooke the company, and in excuse of hir departure sayde, that the streyghtnesse of hir gown greued hir so sore as she was very ill at ease therwith, and the better to counterfeite the matter, she caused Agatha to vnclaspe hir bodie: but alas she was griped with an other claspe more vneasye to be loosed. In thys perplexitie she threwe hir selfe vppon a bedde, and commaunded hyr mayde to depart, faynyng she woulde take some reste: but by no meanes she could entreate Agatha to leaue hir alone, which in deed had bene very perilous for the yong gentlewoma. For as the heate of glowing brondes couered with ashes, are more feruente and violent when they breake out, than the flames of blazing brushe discouered and dispersed in the open ayre, whose visible shewe threateneth more confusion than there is force in the fier to perfourme: Euen so the desolate Persida cloking and dissembling cankered despight in hir feeble stomack, receyued so sodaine a Larum and sharp assault of sundry tormenting conceyts, as if teares had not presently quenched and sighes disgorged the scorching sparkes out of the furnace of hir boyling breast, she had of force immediately consumed into ashes. But as the valiaunt knighte enduring, long in skirmishe assayled on euerye syde with freshe supplie, fynding none other issue to escape, is copelled either to die or render himself vnto the mercy of his enimies: So enuie, hate, and iealousie pinching the tender hart of the comfortlesse mayden, with the grypes of their percing pawes, beating continually their peysant hammers vpon the anuile of loue, enforced pore Persida to yeld hir languishing corpse vnder subiection of their frantike furies. Oh what moued dame nature so neyghbourly to harbour the good and euil, whereof Eternitie hath cause to complayne? eche vertue, beyng placed betwixte two vices. Alas good and bad ioyne so neare togither, as the one is often taken for the other, so contagious is their neyghbourhoode. Iealousie ioyned to loue (as the pricke vnto the Rose) played his part so kindely, as he obteined the preheminence, and hauing the aduantage, made way of entrie to false suspect, who betrayed loue into the hands of his enimies, the faithful companions of his aduersarie: As it is very difficult to conuey treasure from the couetous myser without being espied, whose vigilant eyes and suspitious thoughts attend continually vpon the same: euen so the absence of the perplexed Persida could not long be concealed from the amorous Erastus , who fynding hir aboade very long, imagined diuerse fantasies, approching neare the truth, the which renewed his mortal wound, that not long before was almost cured by a fomentation of the oyle of time, and neare skinned with hope of the recouerie of his welbeloued Iewel. Nowe to satisfye his minde, finely slipping asyde, he repayred to the chamber whither his hart and eye coducted the Damosel at hir departure, whom he foud so extremely plunged in perplexities, like one depriued of al sense, and ouerpressed with passions, as she perceiued him not vntill he seased vpon hir delicate hand. Then feeling hir troubled minde enclosed with new dolours, not able to vtter one word, with a threatning countenaunce and harte swollen with Ire, she turned hir disdainful face to the cotrary side, whiche caused Erastus , vaquishing his suspition by the discouered verity, with a forced spech to vtter these words: How now deare hart, wilte thou be sicke, whilest other be merie? is there no remedie for thy griefe, nor any mean make thee partaker of our mirth (I say our) although the sorow I feele for thy disease iustly depriueth me of al consolation. Wherevnto the Damosell (percing him to the quicke with a cutting looke) answered: Ah harte more trayterous and dissembling than very flatterie it self, is it possible that your deceytful tong can wish hir wel, to whom your harte meaneth so much mischiefe? Is it possible your outward couloured countenance, can couer the disloyaltie you so lewdly pretend inwardly? Alas can one creature be both my Phisition and murtherer? and it is possible that a body of such substance cannot comprehed one drop of pure bloude to vanquishe a flattering face? Ah mocking mouth, how long shal I be bewitched by thy faire speche, thou pyper of false wordes? Ah lyer, ah periured wretch, ah disloyal losel, wherfore dost thou glorie to deceiue a simple mayde whiche beleeued thee, and sekest with thy fardell of trash and trumperie to abuse hir that loued thee. Alas my childish simplycitie deserued rather grace, loue, and fauour. But vnfortunate creature that I am, sith my peruerse destinie once in my lyfe hath bounde me to loue, wherefore hath it grafted in me a stedfaste and loyall hearte? wherefore was it not made of yron or steele to wythstande the dartes of all amorous pittye? or at the leaste syth the heauens decreed to harbour in my breaste a liberall and constant mynde, why dyd they suffer me to make the moste vngratefull disloyall and wauering beast, that euer woman bare, possessour thereof? Alas wherefore haue they ordeyned and vowed me to him, who without regard of my desertes (if constante loue and faithful good will merite anye rewarde) hath rendered me so pittiful recompence? Haue I frequented your company from my tender youth, (said she) (casting hir head into hir bosome, hir eyes flowing with brinishe teares) and yet could neuer know you? suffering my true faith to be deceyued by your disguised semblant? could the poyson of your enuenomed harte lye so long hidden vnder the counterfeyte shewe of your dissembling face: Alas blinde loue, then bleared my sight: but now the truth hath opened mine eyes. Ah nature, wherfore hast thou giuen man a hart contrarye to his song, that of necessitie the one must proue the other a lyer? why are not the teeth (seruants of our sustenaunce) reuengers of all slaunderous lying tongs. Or if a double hart outrageth the tong why is there not a wyndowe in each mans breast thorow the whiche the fraudulent deceites of this malicious guest may be discouered euen in the most secret cabyn of his habitation. If the threde of life had cracked with the falsing of faith, I had not now trauailed in coplaint of him who in dispight of loyaltie triumpheth ouer my loyal affections. But although it were so, yet should not the entier and perfect loue which I haue borne you (O false and disloyal Erastus ) be sufficiently satisfied and reuenged, the which you haue so slenderly acknowleged, as turning the point of mine own weapon towards my hart, you haue obteyned a second louer by the gage of the first, making me the only original of mine own mischiefe. Well, wel, let hir raine hir head softly, and brag in my cheyne, let hir attire  & decke hir selfe with my spoyles, sith that she is inheretrix and possessed of the loue due to me only, wherof I made so great estimation, as I despised al other earthly delightes. Let hir glorie in my shame, and reioyce in my sorowe, whilest I lament and repent the peruerse planting of my pure affections. Ah Erastus, Erastus , it was not against me thou shouldest haue deuised thy crafty collusions so cuningly conueyed: but I am a happie creature to vnderstand them so timely. Wherfore fro henceforth I renounce the vowes, and reuoke al the fauour wherof thou hast bene partaker by my follye, and render thee free libertie to seeke recompence at hir hand, who is so beholding vnto thee, vntill thy wandering affections glutted with one dish of dainties, giue thee appetite to search more delicate diet. Banish me therefore for euermore from thy sight and speech, and blot me clearely out of thy remembraunce: as I for my part, wil practise with al mine endeuor to regester thy lewde demeanor in the roll of obliuion. And to the ende nothing maye hinder myne entent, lo here the parted pledge of thy falsed faith, which I restore vnto the right owner, wyth desire thou mayest neuer thinke, how dearely I haue vntil this houre preserued it. Wherat hir fainting wordes, strangled with sobbes and sighes, died in hir appalled mouth, leauing Erastus so liuely besieged, as although he were sufficiently armed with Constancie,  & strogly fortifyed againste this rude assault, notwithstanding he was forced to yeld the Sconce. The conquered Captaine perceyuing this cruel Alarum finished, and that it behoued him to defende his charge, except by silence he would confesse the crime, comforted his hart, and hartened his tong, and with a fainte courage, after some pause, discharging a deepe sigh he aunswered: Oh God, why is my happe so harde, to be accused without deserte? wherefore haue I founde so vniust a Iudge to heare and determine my fauourable and rightfull cause, as pronounceth iudgemente before mine innocencye be scanned? Ah deare dame, wherfore do you so greatly wrong me, as to credit by surmise the thyng you neuer had any occasion to conceiue? Wherfore (alas) haue lyes such aduauntage of ye truth? what froward fortune hath made me subiect to his peruerse slaunder, whereof I cannot obteine licence neyther to excuse or cleare my guiltlesse conscience? wherefore hath false reporte at once depriued me the grace so luckylye attained by my long and loyall seruice? Swete mistresse, I beseech you for Gods sake, graunt me this one fauor (aboue the rest I haue receyued of your goodnesse,) that before you pronounce the sentence of my death, it may please you to be aduertised what misfortune bereeued me of my chayne, the onely cause of your iust displeasure. Then he opened by processe, how beeing vnmeasurably affected vnto the seruice of his Mistresse, through the cautels and mutabilitie of fortune, he had lost all ioy with his Iewell: concluding in fine, that his mishaps had spit their spight, and that he determined speedily to be free from their puissance, by the succours of their reuenging crueltie, except you sweete heart (sayde he) in presenting vnto hir his naked sword) by your gracious fauour deliuer me out of this torment, punishing him that neuer offended you: The which I require you to performe, if you esteeme my poore harte worthy of so pleasaunt death as your handes shall minister vnto me, by whose ayde I shall not languishe perpetually subiecte to the tyrannie of my cruell misfortune. Beseeching you notwithstanding to imagine, that the Loue I haue alwaies borne towards you, shal sooner be violate by death than by disloyaltie. The Damoysell, in whom rigour and pittie skirmished, during the processe of his tale, felt hir minde so diuersly turmoyled, as in one moment she graunted and denied victorie to both these Champions: so as the toung captiue to his enimies, rendered his office vnto the eyes (which imbraced with ardent passions) darted such cutting glaunces, as no armour, howe harde and well tempered soeuer it were, was able to defende the hart from the pearcing poyntes thereof. Wherewith the sorowfull Louer so wounded, as if thereby he had receyued hir dumbe condemnation, determined him selfe to do the execution with speede. And turning the poynt of his rapier (the miserable remedie of loue) agaynst his valiaunt breast, prodigall of his soule, with a couragious feeblenesse pressed to balance his bodie therevpon, supposing by this piteous sacrifice to appease the rigour of his fierce friende: which in deede he had perfourmed, if Agatha perceyuing his desperate intent, running hastily, had not by great good happe stryken aside the pomell of the Rapier with hir foote, by meanes whereof, Erastus fell flat on the floore, the Rapier vnder him, without receyuing any harme, neuerthelesse with suche noyse as diuers came running into the Chamber: whereof the Louers something ashamed, fayned that the sicke Pacient fell into a sounde. Thus the playe was finished without tragedie, like a Cannon hauing made a false fire. And Persida repented secretly hir extremitie, which had almost caused a maruellous mischiefe, determining to amende at leysure hir hastie rigour. In the meane time Erastus auoyding the Chamber, durst not approche the presence of his Mistresse without the chayne, and deuised in his mynde howe he might obtayne it of Lucina , who enioyed it, beeing altogither ignoraunt who gaue the Iewell vnto hir. Woulde God (sayd he) I were to deale with a man, that I might recouer my losse by fine force: but sith my controuersie is agaynst a woman, it muste be wonne by loue and fauoure. Wherefore he resolued from thencefoorth to purchase the Damosels good wyll by amorous practises, wherein he played his parte so cunningly, as he quickly deserued the name of a friende: whiche greatly impayred the sore he sought to salue. For this deuice bredde greater motion of suspecte in the ielous brayne of Persida , who by meanes thereof made full reckening of so probable euidence agaynst Erastus , as he coulde alledge no excuse sufficient to colour his disloyaltie. Neuerthelesse, bicause she woulde be priuie to all his dealings, she planted espies, which at all times and in euery place diligently attended vppon this poore Louer. Who one nighte going in a Maske to visite his newe Mystresse, proffered to aduenture a riche Carquenet agaynst the Chayne, requiring the same by signes in playe, the whiche after a matche concluded, by good fortune he wanne, and presently departed the ioyfullest man liuing, without discouerture of his person. True it is, Lucina who had receyued the Carquenet in exchaunge of hir Chayne, knew hir chapman, otherwise she would hardly haue departed from the Iewell she esteemed passing all earthlye treasure. But beholde (deare dames,) a cheyne recouered with gayne, whiche shall procure greate losse, as you shall heare: so contrarie all things succeede to suche as importune mishappe pursueth. The day no sooner appeared, but our Erastus , possessing the fruition of his desired Iewel, decked his comely corpse in the brauest manner, as he was accustomed, determining, wyth all conuenient speede, to repaire vnto his Mistresse mansion with a chearefull countenaunce, and to make attonement of their passed quarrell. But at his presente departure from hys lodging, he encountred the louer of Lucina , who already hauing him in iealousie, perceyuing assuraunce of his suspect, redoubled his malice  & malicious intent by viewe of the cheyne, whiche he knew immediatly to be the same he gaue his mistresse not long before, whereby he entred into such sodaine rage, as vnable to qualifye his choler, he exclaimed in this order: Thou naughty & deceitefull villaine, where hast thou stolen this cheyne, wherewith thou braggest in this brauery? and railing in this manner he drew the sword, aduauncing to assaile Erastus , who not vntaught to coole his courage of such crakers, within three blowes pierced the Throte, from whence proceeded so iniurious obloquie, hys enemye disgorging a brooke of bloud from hys receyued wounde, dyed presently in the place. This slayne Gentleman beyng of noble parentage, and greatly friended by reason of his good qualities, which entertained and acquainted him among the best, was much bewayled of manye, and reuenge of his death so earnestly pursued, as if Erastus (notwithstanding hys fauoure and credite in Rhodes) had not by spedie escape saued himselfe, he had daungerously auoyded the markes of too late repentaunce. Alas, beholde the manne in flyghte to shunne the summons of death, banished hys countrey and friendes, depriued of all wordly pleasure and commodities, who euen nowe possessed all ioye, honour and Earthlye felycitye: Fortune hathe full well sufficient occasion to contente hir vnconstancy, hauing for hir pleasure reduced this poore Louer from the mounte of Mirth to the vale of misery. But this greeuous disaster was nothing noisome to his stomacke, in comparison of the absence of Persida , whose remembraunce and displeasure more pinched his hearte, than the tormentes of a thousande deadly pangs. Neuerthelesse, hope, continuallye the faithfull companion of mishap, helde the rinde of the tree, assuring his fantasie, that hys Ladye was partaker of his paine purchased for hir loue,  & that he shoulde want no friendes to procure the pardon of his life, reestablishement of his heritage, and reuocation from his dure exile. In the mean time, onely accompanied with his trustie seruante Pistan , he iorneied towards Constantinople , where he was not so soone arriued, as knowen of diuers Lordes and Knightes, who being witnesse of his vertue and valor that daye the Iusts and Tourneys were solemnized at Rhodes , entertained him according to his merites, making so greate estimation of hys prowesse, as the published fame therof sounded in the eares of Soliman Emperoure of Turkye : Unto whose magnificence Erastus was presented by the Coronel of his armies, with commendation to be the moste valiant, hardy, and experte Knight at armes liuing. Soliman entertained hym, and imployed his newe souldior in pettie exploites, which he executed with such effect, as he gained greater estimation with the Emperour by hys acts, than reportes ministred cause of liking. So that, aswell for the assurance of hys fidelitie, as for hys soueraigne valiauntnesse alreadye experimented, he constituted him Coronel of his Janissaries (whiche we call captaine of the Guarde) and sent him with a puissaunt regiment, to inuade Gasella , whiche was reuolted from the Emperoures gouernment, hauing assembled al the army remaining of the Mamelusians : Where fortune (whose mutable nature constraineth hir to raise againe those she hath subuerted) was so fauourable to his virtue, as she graunted him happy successe in the issue of this enterprise. And striking while the yron was hote, by the Turks comaundement he besieged Belguarde , and toke it, with the death of King Loys of Hungary , after the whiche, accomplishing diuers other notable exploites, hee retourned with glorious triumphe: Wherby hee grewe in suche fauoure and credite wyth hys Lorde, as he elected him one of his Bachattes , and of his priuie Councell. Wherein among other secreate affaires belonging to the common wealthe of the Empire, it was consulted, during the mutuall warres kindled betwixte Frauncis the french King, and the Emperoure Charles , whereby the Christians wer in way of perdition, and determined (considering the apt occasion presently offered) to inuade and conquer the noble and puissaunt Isle of Rhodes , whiche was supposed to be the inuincible key of christendome. Hervpon the whole councell resolued and concluded, Erastus was supposed the meeteste man among them to vndertake the enterprise. Who after due reuerece vnto the Emperoure Soliman , humbly besought his highnesse, that althoughe iust occasion vrged him to seeke reuenge against his vngrateful Countrey, wherevnto hee liued in exile: Neuerthelesse, that it woulde please hys maiestie to pardon hym, that he mighte not be assistant in any expedition so vnlawfull, not for any disobedience that remained in him (for he sought but occasion to testifie and make apparant his faithful seruice) but bicause his duty rather consented to receiue cruell deathe, Soliman aduisedly considering his request, wonderfully commended his good nature, as if in his seruaunte Erastus , he had vewed another Themistocles resuscitate from the graue, who in his time indued with singular bountie, chose rather to dye couragiously than vndertake the destruction of hys natiue Towne, whiche hadde vniustly banyshed hym, fearing to be esteemed a monster generate of some viperous brood, and borne to be the death and ruine of his countreymen, countrey, and naturall mother. Wherfore Soliman in person tooke his voyage wyth an huge armye, conducting all his Galleys, galiottes and Galliasses, whiche were infinite, before Rhodes , where his presence tooke suche effecte, as executyng dyuers secrete practises, the Islande was rendered vnder hys obeysaunce in the moneth of Iune, and in the yeare of our saluation, A thousande, fiue hundred twentie and two, as farre as I remember. And althoughe the inhabitauntes shewed themselues verye wilfull, the victorious Emperoure notwythstandyng (in fauour of hys gentle knyghte, of whome he was alwayes myndefull) vsed more benignitie towardes them, than the rigour of Warres dothe vsually permitte. Euen as Alexander the greate pardoned Thebes for the loue of Pindarus , and Stagirius for the good will he bare to Aristotle : or as the fortunate Augustus entreated rebellious Alexandria at the requeste of Arrius . It was a custome among the Turkes at the takyng of any Towne vpon the enimye, to make choice of the moste accomplished Damoisell in beautie and personage among all the captiue Uirgins, to present vnto the principall captayne, supposing they could not offer hym a more honorable portion of the booty & pillage. This moued them to choose Persida , whome they found in a religious Monasterie of close Nunnes, whether shee was retired to demean a solitary life, hir delightes being clearely abandoned throughe the disaster and exile of Erastus hir deare friende. This Nimphe, the Turkishe troupe presented beefore the Emperoure Soliman , who presently frying in the flame of this celestiall lampe, vewing the desolate Damoisell lapped in lamentations, and almoste drowned in the streames of dispaire, which distilled abundantly from hir christall eies, immediatelye commaunded she shoulde be conueyed with greate pompe towardes Constantinople , shewing in hir presence, his gratious countenance and bountifull liberalitie vnto al hir kinred, how far off or neare soeuer they were allied vnto hir, to the ende hee mighte thereby winne hir fauoure, and pacifie hir sorrowes. Oure captiue departed from Rhodes , and arriued at Constantinople , was lodged among yong Damoysels, nourished, maintained, and taught by olde cunning Eunuches , to sing, daunce, playe on instruments, and to speake the Arabian tongue, committed to their chardge, as a principall threasure to delyghte the Emperoure. In thys Cage Soliman supposed hys mournefull Turtle myghte prune at pleasure hir feltered plummage. At hys retourne he went to visite his prisoner, beholding with greate admiration, the giftes wherewith Nature had rendred hir viewe wonderfull. And althoughe pensiuenesse, hadde exceedingly blemished hir beautye, decaying it (as a sharpe showre fadeth the garden floures) yet felte he his fantasie enflamed with the loue, which sometime triumphed ouer the hearte of Achilles at suche time as Bryseida his prisoner in hir mourning attyre vaquished him after his victorie. This amorous Emperor, after many louing embracings,  & gorgeous gifts profered vnto our desolate Persida (as he whose noble minde regarded more a willing kisse, than a forced contentment importuned here with amiable petitions. The Damosel (resolued rather to dye chaste, than liue dishonoured) for aunswere of his demaund, disbursed abundance of teares and sighs, as she whose hautie courage vanquished by hir proper miseries, prognosticated the future effect of noble enterprises, which caused Soliman somewhat to temper his affections, who leauing hir in this extasie, departed hir chamber, staying wythout the dore, whiche was no sooner shutte, but she opened hir mouth, complete with sorrowful lamentations, and disgorging soaking sighes, as hir stomacke would rieue, sometime she bewailed hir Parents, then hir Countrey, nowe hir friendes and beloued companions: but all, so pitifully, as the Emperoure, who harkened attentiuelye hir whole discourse, in despight of nature was vrged to compassion, whiche vntill then neuer harboured in hys flintie Turkishe breaste, and constrained him to be partaker of hir dolour. But aboue the reste, his harte was drowned in pittie, when as vnfortunate Persida folding hir languishing armes aboute the necke of hir maid Agatha , after the end of hir former complaint, began thus to exclame: Ah my trustie friend, haue I not in one moment exchaunged all my delightes for euer, to leade a life ouerwhelmed with miseries? yea such a life as my enuious fortune hath reserued for my laste rewarde. But alas, among so many euill happes as oppresse me, there is not one to finishe my irkesome loathed life. Oh howe comfortable were the pinching pangs of death to my soule? yea howe easyly shoulde my bones be lodged in my graue, if before I resigne my languishing ghost, my dimmed eies might viewe mine Erastus , or my dulled senses once vnderstand any inkeling where, or how he is bestowed. Ah Erastus, Erastus , my deare friende Erastus , what mishappe dothe hinder vs to liue happily togither, amid oure miseries? Thy only companye alas, would yeelde me a more contented life in the dungeon of dispaire, than depriued of thy presece, to enioy equall felicitie wyth the greatest Queene vppon earth. But alas, sith the heauenly powers haue decreed to linke our firste and moste sincere affections in one, by irreuocable vowes, what contrary destiny hath yelded such piteous successe to our happy beginning? Ah sweete friende, I lament the torment which thy loyall hearte shall suffer, if happily anye prosperous winde whisper in thine eare, the newes of hir death, who hauing no power to liue thine, is resolued to dye hir owne, yet in what coaste soeuer thou remaine (at leaste if thou liue) remember and pittie thy Persida , who consecrating hir chaste loue vnto thy merites, neuer conseted to alter hir choice, or reuoke hir vowed promise, neyther to participate a straunger with thy due, but hathe caried hir faithfull affections companions of hir turmoyled ghoste, vnto hir fatall sepulchre, where they shall be reserued for thy behoofe entire and vndefiled. The whiche I will testifie with the price of my bloude, the onely worthy witnesse, to ratifie my constant amitie, to the ende this voluntary sacrifice of my bodye maye appease the malice of fortune, the soueraigne goddesse of worldlings, and exempte my virginitie from the puissance of an Emperour. In this exploite, deare Erastus , I will practise to accomplishe the charge you straightly enioined me to obserue, when I receued this pretious ring, the guage of thy good will, the whych for thy loue (Oh flower of faithfulnesse) I nowe embrace and kisse with feruent affection, and wishe it in thy hande a sure token of my laste adew. Wherewithall a floude of teares troubled with a storme of sobbing sighes interrupted hir speeche, and with a mortall furye shee drewe a knife from vnder hir gowne, whyche shee hadde prouided for the purpose, fearyng to bee preuented, by the force whereof (lyke vnto Lucretia ) shee resolued to finishe hir wofull lyfe: And all dismayed, wyth a tremblyng hande, shee sette the poynte thereof vppon hir Lyllie breaste, euen the breaste, a perfecte fortresse of Chastitie. When the Kyng, maruellouslye amazed to viewe hir furious enterprise, rushed open the dore, and at one leape seyfed his cruell friende, crying: Ah deare darling, wherfore wilt thou so vnkindly harme the thing which deserueth so carefully to bee preserued? Wherefore dareste thou wyth a deadly toole, force that which by hir delicate force, hath force to enforce the moste saluage and senselesse creatures of the worlde? The poore Damoysell lyke a thiefe taken with the facte, astonied, and muche grieued to bee founde in this estate, but more discontented, hauyng failed the execution of hir attempt, letting the knife fall from hir quiuering fyngers, fixed hir eyes vppon the Earthe, wythoute the vtteraunce of anye speeche. Then the Kyng remembring how affectuouslye hee hearde hir recorde the name of Erastus oftentymes in hir lamentation, speedilye dispatched a Poste, wyth commaundement from his Maiestye, to repaire to the Courte wyth all expedition: Erastus curteous audience, made hys desolate abode in a woodde adioynyng to a Wildernesse, halfe a dayes iourney from the Citie, where wyth greate griefe hee complained the calamitie of hys Countrey, but especiallye the disaster of hys poore maistresse, whome hee reputed euermore forlorne, resolued in thys solitary Mansion, to finishe hys miserable dayes, demeaning suche sorrowe, as hys vnspeakeable losse worthilye deserued: yet beeyng sente for, to his great trouble, failed not to come wythoute delay armed to encounter nothyng but wofull tydings. Being arriued, hee presentlye pressed to the Emperoures presence, who wyllyng hym to arise from the Earthe, leadde hym to viewe the desolate beautie, from whome hee hadde taken the knife, and committed vnder suregarde, bycause hee perceyued hir eares stopped, and hearte hardened agaynste all perswasions of consolation. The Emperoure demaundyng, if hee knewe the Damoysell: Erastus astonied, as one newlye risen from sleepe, knewe not whether hee waked or dreamed: Neuerthelesse, to playe true or false, runnyng towardes hys recouered Persida , caste hys displayed armes aboute hir necke, locking mouth to mouth so close, with the pleasaunte keye of extreame ioy, as thereby the soules of these two Louers were neare vnlosed from their bodies, who deuoide of perseueraunce, remayned in a maruellous extasie, vntill the fountaine of loue, streaming from their eyes, gaue libertye vnto restrained speeche. Then Erastus , embracing the knees of the Emperoure Sultan , saide: Sir, I moste humbly beseeche you, pardon youre seruaunte, if vanquished by too excessiue loue, hee hathe hadde no power to preferre the obseruation of his Lordes commaundement, beefore hys impatient desires, for I confesse (gratious Prince) my duety deserued greater diligence in aunswering youre demaunde. But I felte my fansies so enforced by the renewing of an auncient fyre, kindled in me from my youth, through the perfections of this Damoisell, as thereby forgetting myselfe, it is not strange, if I haue also forgotten my duetye. Notwithstanding Syr, I suppose, if youre noble hearte hathe euer tasted, and experimented true loue, mine offence shall finde excuse before youre Maiestie. The Damoysell on the other side, hauing chaunged hir face of funeralles into a nuptiall countenaunce, beholding the Emperoure wyth an eye wherein loue, perfection, and reuerence bathed their limmes, by little and little vnbrideling hir tongue, briefly discouered vnto him the whole estate of the loue betwixte hir and Erastus , the which they had neuer chaunged for all the diuers iniuries of enuious fortune, but had reserued alwayes entire and vndefiled in the secreate of their heartes, as the corne preserued in the Earthe from the colde of nipping frostes. Affirming in fine, that shee esteemed hir disaster fortunate, that with the presence of hir desired Erastus , haue so wel paide and rewarded hir painefull trauailes, as shee shoulde euer acknowledge hir selfe verye well contented and satisfied, and that hys sighte shoulde serue in steede of a fauourable barke to harboure hir in the laste porte of hir miseries, rendring thankes vnto the Emperour for the benefite she then receiued of him, which was partely a recompence for the destruction of hir Countrey. Soliman behouldyng the effecte of thys vnseparable loue, embraced the two Louers, maruellouslye astonied to vnderstande so strange aduentures, and willingly hadde required to make a thirde, (as didde the Tyrant Dionisius ) if the case hadde imported but amitie. Then tournyng towardes the Princes whyche accompanied him (he said:) By Mahound my Lordes, I haue long mused by what meanes I myghte sufficientlye recompence the seruices done to mee, by thys poore Gentleman, consideryng the perillous trauailes hee hathe endured in mine affaires, neuer sparing to aduenture hys lyfe in moste manifest daungers. Wherein my minde is at this present muche satisfied, sith occasion is offered so aptlye to acknowledge and reward the same, in makyng hym possessour of my Christian prysoner. Then beholding Erastus , hee saide: Sir Knight, sith your loue is so sincere towardes thys Damoysell, as is apparante, I giue hir vnto you as Louer and lawfull espouse, althoughe I am enforced to confesse, that hir beautie, wherein shee surpasseth the moste excellent of Asia , hathe vntyll this presente hadde aucthoritye to commaunde mee. But in this behalfe I wyll vanquishe my proper affections to giue you triumphe ouer my victory: assuring you, that your aduauntage and commoditie, hathe more puissaunce in mee, than myne owne. Wherevnto Erastus answered: My Lorde, I humbly thanke the Heauens, whyche haue planted a hearte so noble and vertuous, in the breaste of my soueraigne King, to haue power to brydle his will, the whiche is vnto you a Trophee more glorious, than if you hadde conquered the Occidente Empire: Wherein sufficient proofe confirmeth youre succession from the excellent race of the Othonians , yeelding vnto you worthilye the rule and commaundement of so many goodlye Realmes and riche Regions. I render and immortall thankes vnto youre Maiestie for the greate goodnesse I haue thys daye receyued of youre liberalitie, whyche I hope to acknowledge, by all the seruices I maye possible do vnto your excellencye, supposyng my selfe in suche wise bounden thereto by thys admirable fauoure, as from henceforthe I shall esteeme the losse of a thousande lyues vnsufficient to gratifye the same. Immediatlye the marriage was celebrated with great solemnitie and magnificence, whiche the Emperoure honoured in person, wyth hys whole Courte. But cursed bee that honoure whereby greate dishonoure ensueth, and horrible myschiefe is commytted. Soliman gaue greate and ryche giftes, and constituted oure Bridegrome Lieuetenaunt and gouernoure of the Isle of Rhodes , whither our fortunate Louers within fewe dayes after the wedding was ended, parted with consent of the whole Seigneurie. O what tongue can vtter the ioyfull delightes this couple receyued, enioying at will that which they had so long desired, leading Fortune triumphantly, who smiled at their deceitfull contentation? for so many pleasures vanished, as an Ele through a wette hande, and they alas liued not long in this amorous delight, so vnconstant are the fruits of this world, wherin we search suretie and stabilitie, yet that which ought to be found strangest is, that the mariage day which seemed most fortunate, was most vnhappie, cloking vnder a coloured sweetenesse, the bitter poyson which procured the piteous death of them both. For beautiful Persida , the more worthily to solemnize this day dedicated in hir fauour, intirely rauished with contentment, was appareled so gorgiously, adorned with an inualuable number of riche stones, which couered hir naturall perfections with suche a glistering brightnesse, as she seemed rather a Goddesse descended from the heauens to amaze the worlde, than any mortall creature: And knewe so wel to display the treasures of hir most rare graces, as she deliuered in suche sort all the delightfull gestures wherein the curtesie of hir person was to be shewed, were it in singing, daunsing, or deuising, as there was none that wholly rauished, marueyled not at hir comelynesse, and esteemed not to haue gayned great conquest and booty, in obtayning at vnwares any wandering glaunce from hir rolling eye: so farre foorth as many wished to supply the place of the Bridegrome. But aboue the rest, the Emperour Soliman touched to the quicke with the dartes of hir eyes (the languishing heades whereof were bathed in the sugred venome of hir delicate deuices) yelded his vanquished libertie to the mercie of this diuine beautie: And loue, whom he pretended to resist, planted his proude foote vpon the Princes heade: so as, whether by the supposed fauour he receiued at hir hande, who sought that day to honour him with all hir endeuour, which he construed to proceede of loue (as Louers take euery thing for their aduantage) or for that he stoode to neere this pleasant fire, he felt his heart so warmed, and his former intent so altered, as al his determination was wholly to please his pardoned captiue, who by a cruell reuenge, nowe emprisoned him so straightly, as although (reuiuing his auncient vertue) he was resolued to deliuer hir, yet with ioyned handes he was enforced to require grace. So as this greefe by little and little grewe so great, hauing taken roote by his consent, as in a while neither continuance of time (which breedeth obliuion) nor the distaunce of his Louers abode, nor yet the remebrance of the seruices receyued of Erastus (which bounde him only not to be vngratefull, but also to mortifie his passions) coulde not dissuade him from bitter repentaunce of his too frank offer and vnaduised liberalitie: by the which he departed from a Iewell more precious and worthy of estimation vnto him, than the halfe of his Empire. Thus finding no remedie in his naturall constancie, lastly concluded to giue the bridle vnto his rebellious and vntamed affections, esteeming nothing impossible for him to compasse, hoping that Persida vanquished by his benefites, would render him in the ende a gracious recompence. Wherfore determining to let hir vnderstande the torments he endured for hir loue, taking ynk  & paper, he wrote as foloweth. If the Goddes in their creation of man had graunted him liberal fauour to gouerne his affections, & by mayne force to maister his rebellious passions, I had not nowe bene compelled (faire Persida ) to entreate newe succours, to resist the assaultes deliuered me by my domesticall enimies: But hauing long skirmished in the defence of my libertie, findng my feeble force continuallye oppressed by a multitude of freshe assaultes, I am enforced to submit me vnto the mercy of their proude victorie, considering I am promised so fauourable composition. You neede not demaunde (Maistresse) what puissant aduersarie assaileth me, sith you knowe the whole force of the world are subiect vnto my power, your rigorous beautie onely excepted, which hath made so large a breach in my heart, as notwithstanding any rampier I haue sought to plant, or any fortification I can deuise, it is impossible for me to withstande the fearefull alarums and furious assaultes which night and day represent before me the perpetuall remembraunce of your rare perfections. And although it greeueth me much to become slaue vnto my captiue prisoner through the vengeance of cruell loue, because I haue despised his inuinsible forces: So it is, considering the merite of your diuine graces, I haue occasion to glory, beeing ordayned to serue your soueraigne beautie, which onely deserueth to commaunde a Soliman , whome al the world obayeth. Hoping that if it be not blemished by secret obstinacy, you will quickly recompence the painefull trauayles of Him, who expecteth his onely comforte from your fauour, Sultan Soliman . These Letters closed and sealed with the Royall Signet, were deliuered to a Page, whose fidelitie was well knowne, who instructed of his duetie ariued with all diligence at Rhodes , where he founde hir to whom he was sent alone with hir damoysells, for at that time Erastus was ridden on hunting. Wherefore the Page hauing done humble reuerence vnto the Lady, deliuered hir his Lordes letter, with his moste louing commendations, the which she receyued with a thousande hartie thankes for the gracious remembraunce it pleased the King to haue of his humble Lieuetenaunt Erastus . Then retyring aparte, she read the whole contentes, not without great trouble of minde. Neuerthelesse, wisely dissembling hir thoughtes with a smyling countenaunce excellently counterfayted, she enquired of the affayres of the whole Court, demaunding if the Messenger had any other charge, although the letters bare sufficient credite of the contrarie. Who answered, he had none other businesse but to returne speedie answere of the letters he brought, whiche caused the Lady to frequent hir closet, where often she tooke penne in hande, which with shamefastnesse dropped out of hir chaste fingers, vntill at length solicited and pressed by duetie, she wrate this answere. My soueraigne Lorde, I haue receyued the letters which it hath pleased your Highnesse to write vnto me, the superscription whereof (for the honour you vouchsafe vnto your humble seruaunt in taking so great paynes) gaue me not more cause of ioy, than the contents ministred occasion of meruayle. For considering the same, I stande doubtfull whether I sleepe or wake, beeing enforced to mistrust mine owne eyes, because I can not perswade my selfe, neither imagine howe your excellencie (the true mirrour and patterne of soueraigne vertue) could render your hande so muche enimie to your harte, as to permit the same to write the thing so alienate and altogither contrarie to your so sincere reputation: yet for as much as I doubt not (right excellent) but your noble minde in iesting for your disport, delighteth to proue what profite I haue attayned of the vertuous examples which continually flowe in your Maiestie, I most humbly beseeche you (for resolute answere) that it maye please you to be assured, that the benefites of your Magnificence, hath in such wise drawne me vnto your seruice, as I will search (and esteeme my happe fortunate) to encounter the wished meanes, which in all respectes may satisfie & please your highnesse: so farrefoorth as the limits of chastitie & bounds of honestie shall suffer and permit. The which with my whole endeuour I wil mainteine and defende euen vnto the last gaspe of my life. Acknowledging, that although he that hath made me, hath powre to marre me, yet she is neuer to be forced that can and will dye, wherewith I shall be better contented, than dishonoured to liue a life abounding with delightes and worldly honours. And for testimonie hereof, which I will seale with my harte bloud, moste mightie Monarche, I kisse the victorious handes of your hautinesse, desirous for euer to remaine The most humble and obedient seruaunt of the mightie Emperour of the Turkes. Persida . The Page hauing his dispatch, without long abode with posting speede caried these letters to his Lorde, who attended his returne in great good hope: but hauing perused them, he found small reliefe in hir wise answere, whereby ignoraunt where vppon to resolue, he purposed for his comfort to impart his greefe vnto his Cousin Brusor Bellerbeck of Seruia , who like the other Princes of Sangiacs , enuied Erastus extremely, because he had bene more aduaunced by the Emperour than their ambition could tollerate. Nowe after long deliberation  & counsell in the matter, it was supposed betweene them a thing vnpossible, to allure the rebellious and obstinate Persida , vnlesse she were first depriued of Erastus , which (quoth he) will be easily compassed, notwithstanding the loue  & fauour he hath obtained among the garrisons aswell of the Janissaries , as the Estradiots , so that your Maiestie will sende for him by your straight commaundement, the which I am certain he will not disobay, but make his speedy repaire with his whole familie: and beeing present, I will finde occasion he shal be accused of reuolt  & rebellion, whervpon being comitted to prison for the offence, iudgement and execution of death may ensue. The Emperour ioyfully embracing this wicked Counseller, comended exceedingly his inuention, and dispatched him presently to practise the execution of his diuelishe deuice. At his ariuall at Rhodes , the honourable entertainements he receyued (vnmeete for a mischeeuous meaning) might haue conuerted his malicious minde from the prosecution of his bloudy enterprise, if courtesie and innocencie had entreated a valiant hart, as they encountered a trayterous entent. But Brusor vnder colour of secret  & waightie affaires, allured & ledde poore Erastus to Constantinople , where he was no sooner alighted from his horse, but the Marshall of the Emperours housholde attached  & committed him close prisoner vnder sure garde. The King supposed to seyze vpon his Louer (as the hungry Hawke stoupeth like a leaden lump vpon hir pray) nothing mistrusting the feuer which detayned Persida , but he reckned without his hoste, and fared the worse for his snatching. At laste finding his fancie deceyued, blaming his haste, he deuised howe to satisfie his faulte. Neuerthelesse, resolued to strike whyle the yron was hotte, with speede prosecuted the processe agaynst the poore Gentleman, and by false witnesses of purpose prouided, Erastus was accused, and conuicted of treason  & rebellio, for that he had consented (sayd they) to deliuer the Ile of Rhodes into the possession of the Christians: for which offence iudgement passed vpon him, and by the Emperours comandement he was beheaded. Wherwith those whose minds had vertue in recomendatio were so miscontented, as they could not refrayne to murmure  & rayse sedition. But Persida , who coulde not long forbeare the company of hir yong husbande, shooke of hir sicknesse, purposing to meete him homeward: But alas hir iourney was soone stayed by a sodayne report of the treason so lewdly conspired, and the lamentable death which ensued. So that enraged dolour assailed hir in such sort at these sorowfull newes, as she returned in a sounde vnto the bed from whence she was so lately awaked. And by the efficacie of this mortall passion, had finished the smal remainder of hir life, the which (fearing it would continue to long) she sought to aduaunce by the reuenging power of hir misfortune, so as brusing hir white brest, and tearing hir yelow heare, she imagined what sodaine death might dispatch hir with least payne (sith in this life there was no hope of grace to be expected for hir reliefe.) When poore Pistan (hir trusty seruaunt newly returned after ye death of his good master) seeing he could neither comfort nor dissuade hir from hir pretended mischiefe, spake thus: Madame, sith you will perseuer in rigour agaynst your person, at lest I beseech you defer the executio therof vntil you haue reuenged the death of the best knight that euer bare launce, and testified what power his innocencie hath possessed in you euen after his death. Then will we depart  & carie ioyfull tidings vnto the Paradise of blessed soules, where my master attendeth our coming. These words somewhat appeased hir fury, wherby taking a maly courage, she assembled succeurs, mustred souldiers, & made prouision of necessarie furniture to resist the power of barbarous Soliman , who made no long abode with gret ordinance to approch  & inuade this inuincible chastitie, like as the roring Lion deuoureth the fearefull hinde. But contrary to his expectation, the Castell was so well defended as he knew neither wher he was, nor what to do, now cursing his tyranny, the his licetious desires, ye only occasion of so great mischiefes. Neuerthelesse, hee determined to goe throughe what so befell therof, & to see the ende whatsoeuer it cost him. Wherin he had bin deceyued if the wofull Persida , consenting to liue so long after the losse of hir deare friend (the greefe wherof permitted hir neither truce nor rest) had not ayded him, lingering happily to testifie vnto the ashes of Erastus , (the liuely memorie whereof continually consumed hir) how his death extinguished not their eternal loue: wherby buckling vnto hir body the armour which sometime pertained vnto hir friend, I meane the grene armour the perfect temper wherof was so doughted, after many lamentations of force to moue the dumbe towers of the Fortresse to pitie hir distresse, she mounted to the top of a vault, where bending hir watered eyes  & woful hart with ioyned hands vnto the heauens, she prayed hir creator to receiue hir pure & cleane soule betwixt his armes into the company of his soule, whose body now dead liuing was the onely Lorde of hir chast & sincere desires. Then casting hir bedewed eyes towards the sea side, she perceyued the Turks preparing their power to assault & enter the Castell. Among whom espying & knowing Soliman , with a sterne voyce she exclaymed: Ah mischieuous Barbarian, thou cruell and vngratefull wretch of mine Erastus benefites, whose seruices thou hast so tirannously recompenced, embrue thy bloodie pawes, and glut thy greedy paunch with the bloud of thy faythfull seruaunt, whom thou hast not wholly murthered, beholde here his one halfe yet liuing. Finishe therfore thy wicked brutish tyrannie, at lest if it haue an ende. This sayde, she aduaunced hir head and breast aboue the battlementes of the wall, making semblaunce to discharge this Canon shot agaynst the Turkes: who taking hir for some souldier, loosed a volue of shot, among the which two bullets sent from a Musket stroke hir through the stomack, wherwith the vertuous Dame feeling the approche of hir death, sate downe, crossing hir armes and staying hir head agaynst a stone, lyke a stacke of Corne, whose binding ridge is ouerblowen by a boysterous blaste of winde. Oh constacie meritorious of the heauens, oh death worthy of eternal life, the glorious Angels conduct thy soule among the blessed saincts, and thou vngracious gemme, art thou not ordayned to dispight Dame nature? Sith thy mettall, fire and thunder, dare presume to offende hir principal handyworke. Ah beautifull and vertuous Damoysell, why shewed the heauens their liberalitie in bestowing their gracious gyfts so abundantlie vpon thee, and so nigardly to impart fortunes blessings towards thee? who because thou art not an abiect as hir other common creatures, but vnder a humaine shape hast enclosed a precious sparke of diuinitie, could not abide thee, like the foolishe dolte, that esteemeth and lulleth his Bable, and stampeth precious treasure vnder his feete? Alas faire creature, deseruedst thou so cruell entreatie? vnlesse thou wouldest make no better market than that thy destinie had vowed thee, to the ende the perfectest couple among men hauing bin companions of a short and sorowfull life, might be likewise partakers of a dolorous death. The newes of the Ladies maruellous accident was not long concealed from them of the Castle, who astonied of so great constancie, mused not to complayne suche a losse, but in playing dooble or quit, determined to imitat this notable vertue, lest they should seeme in any respect inferiour to women. Wherfore as well men as women armed them as ioyfully as a bride putteth on hir wedding apparell, and orderly marching in faire ordinance vnder the conduct of good Pistan , issued out furiously, where beeing weerie of the gret slaughter of their enimies, they skirmished so desperately, as they yeelded but only to death, who taking them to mercy, gaue the glorious manumission of mundayne miseries to make their soules triumph among the inhabitants of heauenly felicitie, which treade vpon the head of peruerse fortune. Thus the cruell Tyrant tooke possession of the Castle, wherinto entring fearfully, he found no creature but the pale body of coragious Persida , resembling a Rose which by age hath lost ye red liuely hue, loking so swetely as a ma would haue said she stept, if hir set eies  & losse of bloud streming fro hir woudes, had not ministred manifest aduertisement of certain death) Oh who coulde expresse the sorow of Soliman , seeing after so manye trauailes, the beautie mortified, for the whiche hee liued? Alas, after hee had a thousande tymes kissed hir colde mouth, hee drew his faulchion,  & brandishing his poysie brond about him, he hurt and slew as many of his people as would abide, but speedily they fled hys presence, and lefte hym alone. At length gathering his wittes vnto him, hee deuised by what meanes hee might amend hys faulte, and accomplishe some notable reparation vnto the diseased soules of the two louers, so cruelly offended. The immediatly hee sente for al the Princes and Lordes of hys countrey, commaunding them honorably to conducte the heade and body of Erastus from Constantinople to Rhodes . In the meane time hee called togither the moste cunning Caruers, Grauers, Painters, drawers of workes and limners, commaunding them to finishe a beautifull bed of white Marble perfectly pollished, wherin the bodies of Erastus and Persida seared, washed and embaulmed in oyle of Ceder, by the Emperours commaundement were layde vppon pillowes wroughte, and embrodered with gold and silke, hauing firste apparelled their bodies with the richest robes that might be possibly deuised, wherevppon pearles and pretious stones of inestimable valure were not spared. Then hee caused them to bee enclosed in a closet or cell of fine Venice Christall, wherevnto adioyning, hee builded a quadrant Aulter quartred wyth Hebain, Iasper, Geat, and Purphiry, beset with Agattes and Margarites, wherevppon was eleuate the Image of Faith embracing Venus , bearing in hir hand a wheele, in the top wherof stoode the figure of Constancie, holdyng in the one hande the ring, and in the other hande the chaine whereof wee haue spoken before, and the foure vertues Prudence, Iustice, Fortitude, and Temperaunce, were placed vpon the foure corners of the Altar, who leaning their heads in their lappes, shewed a desolate coutenaunce. The whole worke was so excellently finished as I doubt neither the sepulchres of Loys the twelfth, and Frauncis the firste, whiche are at Saint Denis in Fraunce, nor the famous Tombe of Mausole are comparable to this, whiche surpassed the workemanship of the Colosse round about the bed wherin rested these loyall Louers, were the pictures of Pistan and Agatha , with the other Damoysells whiche were founde deade in the battaile, sitting orderly in chaires of Corall and Iuorye. This monument is yet to be seene in Rhodes , wythin a Chappell of blacke Marble, in the toppe whereof the sorrowfull Soliman (who euery daye visiting his workemen, bathed the worke wyth warme tears) commaunded a Piramede of brasse to bee erected, in the heigth whereof, hee caused the traitor Brusor to bee hanged, in guerdon of hys wicked counsell whereof you haue had vnderstanding. God graunte al false counsellors and seducers of princes the lyke rewarde. When all things were accomplished to the Emperoures contentation, accompanied wyth all the Princes, Lordes,  & Ladies of his Courte in mourning attyre, he celebrated the obsequies and funerall pompes, castyng flowers and perfumes, with so greate lamentations, as they seemed rather people iudged to dye, and going to theyr graues, than mourners lamenting the funeralles of others. Beholde howe thys poore Barbarian, with a Persican sumptuousnesse and memorable honoure of eternal fame, sought to repaire his tyrannicall crueltie committed, protesting to consume the remainder of his solitarie life in sorrowfull repentaunce, constituted from the funerall daye for euer, a solempne feaste to be solemnized, whiche to this day is nominated The feast of Lamentable Loues, and is yerely renewed in the pitifull remembraunce of the deade. In whose fauour the Emperoure graunted greate liberties, and gaue generall pardon vnto the whole Isle. But in takyng breathe, I hadde almoste forgote howe in this Temple there was a brode plate of fyne Golde of Osir, wherein was written in Azured Letters the whole Historie, with thys Epitaph ensuyng. Disburse thy brynishe teares, Beholde this pearelesse Princely pile, The whiche true recorde beares Howe Soliman to worke hys wil, Hath cutte the fatall threede, And made a wofull sacrifice Of two that here lye dead. VVithin this gorgious stately Tombe, These creatures are enblosde, On whome dame Nature in their life Hir golden gifts dispos'd: In beautie, witte, and comely grace, None liuyng might compare VVith these, whose loue was linckt in one, Their vertues were so rare, That heauen with al the heauely powers Grewe iellous of these wights, And did suppose the earth too base To yeelde them due delightes: They gaue the worlde aucthoritie These louers to disdaine: That they amid their flouring youth Mighte with the gods remaine. By Fortune, Enuie , and by Death , This couple caughte their bane, VVhen harde mishappe by princely power Enforste a Virgins shame, He in redresse of infamy This Trophee did deuise: A memorie perpetual VVher these two Louers lies. Oh Soliman thou Turkishe prince Thy tiranny deplore, Erastus with his Persida Doth ioy for euermore, VVhose perfecte loue and Amitie, True witnesse of thy blame Shall blased liue eternally Triumphantly by fame. By this piteous tragicall historie you maye coniecture (gratious company) my saying to bee true, that all lamentations, miscontentmentes, and misfortunes chauncing in loue, proceede on the behalfe of women, who harboure this mishappe in them, (yea euen the moste perfecte) of force to be alwayes the originall of some misfortune, althoughe it be in their despight. As the example of oure Persida maye verifie: In whome it seemeth by the errour of nature, a manly hearte was lodged: for may any man finde or desire a more firme and constant loue, than hirs, whych stedfastly endured vntill after death? And yet was hir disaster so greate, as twice shee procured the ruine of hir friende and hir self. The first time, whe hir poore Louer, losing by mischance hir chaine, euen in hys Ladies seruice was perpetually banished from hir gratious presence, without memorie of his valure newly experimented, or the merite of hys auntient loue, his fidelitie wherein so oftentimes testifyed, might neuer fynde place in the rigorous harte of his vniust maistresse. So muche womenkinde yeelde vnto the mercy of vaine opinion, as they locke the gate of veritie againste themselues, throughe the selfe loue of obstinate fantasie. The whiche the sage lawemakers of Athens considering, and afterwarde the Romaines, forbode them the estate of iudgement, knowing there is no cause so iuste; whiche was not by them ouerthrowne. The seconde tyme was, that these twoo louers being by heauenly fauoure miraculously coupled togither, enioying contrary to al hope, euen when they wer moste suppressed with misfortunes, the pleasure so much desired, were againe separated by the faulte of the too beautifull bride, who pleasing the King ouermuche, approched the flame so neare the flaxe, as it caused the destruction of hir Brustus , and hir owne soone after: when keping hir Castell, to amende hir faulte, shee couragiously preferred honor before life. Wherin I confesse shee somewhat satisfyed hir deade friende. But if any man wyll accuse Soliman , those whiche are lawfull Iudges in the Courte of Loue wil easely excuse him, when they remember how the force of Loue constraineth vs to doe things vnpossible to nature and right: and that there is none so constant, which can refraine to drinke, being broiled with thyrste, especially finding a fitte fountaine. Surely it was verye likelye, that the poore Princes passions lyke vntamed coltes had broken the raines of reason, by the amends and reparation hee imparted vppon the shadowes of the deceased louers. The like satisfaction was sometime made by the Frenche king, at the instaunce of his councell, hauyng vniustly slaine Juetot , whose lande hee fraunchised in all soueraintie, and possessed hir heyres wyth a Kyngs right in Normandy , whiche perhappes caused the soule of the murthered, more patiently to tollerate his death. For Histories are repleate with many vertuous courages, which voluntarily haue lost their liues, by their death to gaine some aduauntage and profite vnto theyr Countrey, kinred and friendes, as oure louers did, who by their death restored againe the auntient priuiledges vnto theyr natiue Isle, reduced into the seruitude of their mortall enimies. Whervnto Maistresse Mary aunswered: Sir, you digresse somewhat from the matter, but leaste wee shoulde range too farre without our boundes, I praye you tourne bridle towardes your conclusion, by the which you burthen Persida to bee the occasion of the misery of this vnfortunate loue, to whome hauing by constraint attributed commendation, you accuse to haue stopped hir eares vnto the Iustice of hir Erastus cause, whyche well deserued bothe excuse and absolution. Secondly, that shee was too studious to content the Emperoure vppon hys wedding daye, whome you woulde excuse as vanquished, by hys vitious affections, assailed by a beautie, whyche no manne coulde resiste, so greate disabilitie remayneth in menne. But I praye you, wherefore dydde not youre Soliman imitate the vertue of Agesilau , who refused to kisse Megabatta : saying, Faire Ladye, retayne your owne libertie without retention of mine: or ye wisedome of young Alexander , who saluting the daughters of Kyng Darius , durste not behoulde them, fearing leaste the beautifull glaunces of their alluring eye mighte blemishe hys sighte? or the continencie of the braue Romaine Emperoure, who for hys share refused the fayre Carthaginoise, whome (saide hee) he wold willingly haue receiued, had he bin but a simple souldior. But hee was of opinion, that who so meddeleth to commaunde, muste shewe a greater excellencie, than those hee commaundeth, commaunding hymselfe, refusing to bee commaunded of anye. Notwythstanding youre Turke obserued not thys good lesson, but receyued gladlye the presentation of the faire Rhodiane , from whom hee woulde neyther detaine hys eye, hande, nor hearte. And in one worde to defende Persida , the Theologians holde opinion, that good or euill actes are not to bee iudged by their sequeles, but by the motiue inuention of their originall: whiche cause the allurementes and lubricitie of Cleopatra and Herodias to bee condemned, bycause the one was willing to please the Emperoure Antonius in despighte, to sette hir lasciuious beautie at sale, where it was euill bestowed. The other to content Herod , thereby to winne his consente vnto the death of Saint Iohn Baptiste, by an vnaduised promise. But the beautie of Susanna, Bersaba, Judith , or Hester discouered naked, is not to bee reproued, what euill soeuer happened on the behalfe of one, bycause their intents were pure and sincere. But there is no excuse to warrant men, who knowing their owne imperfections, oughte to close their eyes, leaste they viewe too much, and as the Prouerbe saith, to looke vpon maidens sleeping, and yet perchance see too clearely. But such in their excuses do resemble the drunkard, who blameth the wine, which is no otherwise than to bee hidden in water for feare of the raine. Wherfore we haue better reason to excuse the beautie of Persida , and to blame the disordinate desires of the Barbarian, who being the sonne of the moste wicked and cruell Emperoure, that euer bare crowne (althoughe Nero hadde then lyued) contended to surmounte his father in crueltie, to confirme the auntient prouerbe, that the Egle hatcheth not a pigeon. And in so much as you blame hir, that she receyued for none paiment the faire excuses of hir friend, I pray you, what coulde shee doe lesse, seeing and knowing hir chaine about the necke of a faire damoysell (among whome ielousie accustomably is nourished,) but suppose Erastus had giuen it vnto hir, whiche if he had done, she might well thinke it was not for anye euill hee wished hir. But though you saye, shee shoulde haue beleeued him swearing the truth, my conscience will hardly consent therevnto. For if othes might take place, men woulde make a game of disloyaltie, knowing they might be acquited by swearing. The which notwithstanding, hath continually mocked poore maidens, who credite whatsoeuer men tell them, to bee as true as they speake, and mean truly. As the nimph Oenon teacheth vs to hir domage, deceiued by a simple shepheard, who besides that hee was greatly bounden vnto hir, made manye solempne vowes and promises to continue hir faithfull friende, which are witnessed by all the trees of mounte Ida , bearing engraued in their barke these verses:  More sooner shall the flowing floode Of Xanthus sewe and drye: Than Paris shall Oenon good Forget, or once denye. Notwithstanding hee bothe forgatte, and chaunged hys affection, the floude continuing in his pristine estate. But bicause we will not fishe so deepe, I demaunde of you, (not meaning thereby to confute your argumentes) the effecte of youre poeticall Oracles, whiche teach you howe to loue, and giue you licence to deceyue yong maides, not only by simple wordes, but also by othes: for the whyche, Venus by hir Bulles, indulgences, and pardons, giueth you intier absolution and remission. So as youre Jupiter king of youre amorous Courte, when hee seeth anye man by swearing abuse a credulous virgin, hee leapeth for ioye, to viewe the cunnyng of his forwarde disciple: As thoughe mockery and deceite were the sauces to make loue seeme more sauorous. Pardon me Maistresse (replied the Gentleman) you shoote too highe to hitte the white: For whatsoeuer I haue spoken, I desire no otherwyse, but that women shoulde as well credite men, as they are beleeued of them. Then all thynges woulde succeede so happyly, as no contradiction shoulde neede in Loue. And touching the excuse you preferre Theologicallye, to couer the faulte commytted by the Ladye Persida , so curiously entertaining the loue of the Kyng, by the behauioure of hir good graces: I enquire not what shee meante thereby, but sith shee was not ignoraunte of the ardent affections, whyche immediately beefore assotted Soliman in hir behalfe: and knowyng the fyre esteemed to bee extincte, oftentimes by small blowing groweth greater and hotter than before, shee oughte with misliking lookes to haue quenched the sparkles remaynyng. And if you will replie, that it behoued hir the same daye to honour the Kyng, and that duetye bounde hir to doe no lesse: I demaunde wyth youre fauourable licence, what care oughte to haue moued hir to seeme beautiful or browne in the Kyngs conceite, sythe shee was in all respectes agreeable vnto hir husbandes lyking? for the greatest vertue (sayde Euboidus ) resident in a woman, is to be vnknowne of anye, but hir husbande: And a womans praise in a straungers mouthe (accordyng to Argeus opinion) is but hir secreate blame. Further, the same affyrmeth it to bee a daungerous matter, for women desirous of good fame, to loue to bee liked, and by alluring lookes to please others at banquettes, where the mouth is not onely prepared to excesse, but also the eye to feede vppon follies: Whych in olde tyme caused women to frequente no feastings: but if happilye anye were seene at anye banquet, they were suche as men woulde rather demaunde vnto howe manye they were mothers, than to whome they were wiues: besides they thoughte it vnseemelye to bee openlye seene, and therefore euer in all assemblies they vsed vailes to couer their faces. As we reade howe mightie Sulpitius rebuked hys wife for walking withoute hir vaile. This causeth oure Damoysells in these daies, (sayde Sire Firme Foy ) so willingly and carefully to maske and marche vnder scarffes, but principallye the foule and euill fauoured, wherevppon thys other daye I composed these verses.  VVhat moueth men abashed thus to stay, As tumbled from the cloudes in suche a mase? Sith Maidens mockes doe yeelde but mere delay: VVhose cloking scarfes doth holde men at the gase, VVhilst couered close in shape of masking showe, By deepe deceyte our ioyes they ouerthrowe. Bereaue them of their outwarde masking vayle Yet inwardly disguised they remayne: Their thoughtes lye hidde, their tounges of truth do fayle, Till sugred wordes the harmlesse hart hath slayne: If in their chaunge they fast on men their hookes, Their smiling then conuertes to louring lookes. Let vs returne to our purpose, quoth Syr Fleur d' Amour , I require not so great obseruance in hyding their faces, which the Venetians frequent, counterfayting the Lacedemonians : For chastitie, not couersluttes, is the preseruatiue of beautie. Neither would I haue enioyned Persida so sharpe penaunce, as to walke vnder a shadowe vpon hir wedding daye, although the Tortois is placed at the feete of a chaste woman, as it is blazed in auncient armorie, because the Tortois came vnto the mariage of Dapsile all couered and hidden: yet I would haue wished she had shewed a little more modestie. For, as Cesar sayd, it is not onely requisite for women to eschewe the euill, but also the suspition of euill. The which caused Maerina , during the absence of hir husbande, to keepe hir house eleuen yeres togither, rather wishing to dye than to be seene looking out at hir windowe. Touching the seconde poynt wherin Persida would not beleeue Erastus , declareth the incredulitie of a woman to be oftentimes the occasion of great mischiefes. And wherein I pray you (demaunded maistresse Margaret ) doo you finde women more mistrustfull than men? S. Thomas will neuer agree therevnto, neyther the great Emperour, of whom you speake, who because he would not beleeue his louer Taphurna , was miserably slayne. I seeke none other proofe (said Syr Fleur d'Amour ) but that which is described in the schoole of loue, which we call Paris , videlicet , if a woman finde not hir husbande alwayes in one estate and disposition, she straight entreth into suspition of exchaunge: the whiche if he seeke to extinguishe, swearing by all the Saincts of the Parishe, yet will she not credite any thing but hir fantasticall imagination. But if the husbande beholde his wife playing the wanton before his face, she will make him beleeue he tooke his marke amisse, or hath eaten cheruell, whose vertue is to mistake one for another, so as he may not credite his eyes, but beleeue hir, yea and craue pardon for wrongfull slaunder. At these wordes all the Company began to laugh: when the Stewarde of the housholde, who attended their leysure, prayed them to come to Supper, where if it please you we will take our leaue of them vntill the morning. The ende of the first dayes Sport. experiment howe great their desire is of reuenge, or the loue of honour bought with the price of much blood, by equall force of armes doo fighte, vntill the night, mother of confusion, doth separate them from their bloudie conflict, by a necessarie retreate, attending on both partes with impacient expectation the spring of day, to execute to the vttermost the omitted combate: Euen so our couragious Champions, hauing forborne the extremest execution of the sharpe conflict of their toungs, begonne the day passed, watched the returne of the next dawning, to be reuenged: But principally the Maydens, who esteemed their interest hindered by the aduauntage whiche the men had alleaged to suppresse their iuste title: but that their libertie rested equall to defende their cause the daye following. Which beeing come immediatly, the Maydens first awaked, who tooke the matter somewhat neare their heartes: And beeing firste vp, with casting bottelles full of sweete waters, went to salute their aduersaries, for their good morrowe, wyth an asperges of the deawe of Innocentes: and after the deliuerie of a thousande onsettes, without all remission, and worse if worse maye bee, in fiue, they concluded a peacible parle, whiche gaue them leysure and meane to apparell them, whiche they had not so soone finished, but tyme vrged them to repayre vnto the garden, where the Tables were couered for dinner, vnder a triangle Arbour, at the foote whereof was a goodly quicke set of Rose trees, enterlaced so thinke as they resembled a bloomed benche: and at euery corner was an Image of a Satyre, holding in one hande a cuppe of Iaspar, so artificially vernished with Uermilion, as a man woulde haue thought it had beene full of Claret wine, and all the three seemed to drinke vnto three Nimphes, carued finely aboute a fountayne adioyning, hauing their horned heades leaning vppon their other hands, and vnder hir tayle eche one had his Table. In the first was written. In shrowde of shadie verdant vine, in wreathed braunches I Quaffing out cuppes of pleasaunt wine, with vpright face do lye: Approche my prettie dayntie trull, a while let vs two kisse and cull. For as the tickell wheele doth glide, and force with beautie wans away: So youth without returne doth slide, and wormes vpon our fleshe shall pray. And in the roundell of the seconde Satyre was to be read: VVhy doo the Lillies fade away, and pleasant sentes resigne my graue: Let rather violets freshe and gay, my tender heare enuiron braue. Bring heere to me my loue so faire, to quallifie my pining care, So as before the day when I must leade the daunce among the dead, All sorrowes from my sight may flye, and ioye possesse my troubled head. In the stone of the thirde Siluane was engraued: Let vs conioyne in nuptiall bedde, Citheria cladde in Roses fyne, VVith Bacchus smiling white and redde, and fraught our heades with drowsie wine: O pleasaunt deawe of flowers Queene, O deawe the fauour of the spring, Deawe deare delight of heauenly eyen, deawe crowning loue in euery thing. VVhen Bacchus giues the graces fayre his hande, and leades their daunces braue, My crest shall be of Roses rare, my head eke full of wine of graue: Then will I choose the fayrest out, and leade my selfe the daunce about. In the middest of the three drinkers, there stoode a table of a rounde stone, about the whiche were many small Images of diuers formes and figures, whiche serued for stooles: but for the Cupborde was a young Shepheard, hauing his minion by the aperne, wherevppon a man might very properly set drinking glasses. The Shepheard had a fine place to set a bottell vpon the toppe of his scrippe, wherevpon was written. VVhat thing, the elder that it growes, hath greater force and might? And stronger eke lesse malice showes, to harme the worldly wight? And most assayled most doth byte, Yet natures freende and loues delite? And vpon the distaffe of the mayden, was a proper roome for a basen and ewer, whereouer these words were to be read: VVhat can a speedie course maintaine, at all not hauing any feete, Or else still cackling noyses faine, without a toung for vttraunce meete, Yet still in earth and ayer prest, to spoyle it selfe for euery guest. The whole company beeing there assembled, they founde the Lady of ye place endeuoring by all meanes to make them good cheare: vnto whom Sir de Firme Foy and his companions dooing their duetie, sayd, Behold (Madame) how great cause we haue to complaine of you, in that you seke not to defend your friends, especially so neare vnto you (where they should finde most assuraunce) yet receiue neither equitie nor iustice. Howe so my friendes? (sayde the Lady.) Bicause (replied the Gentleman) that these Damoysels feeling their causes iniuried somwhat by our yesterdayes talke, in place to haue reparation by iustice, haue vsed handie force, and by actuall meanes defended by the lawe, haue so outragiously made assault vpon vs this morning, as if you accuse vs, in that we haue made you so long to attende vpon your dinner: we haue iuste occasion to call them for our warrant, as the cause of our delay. No, no (sayde the Lady, smiling) if you haue somewhat lingered to come to dinner, you haue obtayned absolution by your long fasting. And touching the force  & violence which might haue bin done vnto you, agaynst the right of harberage so holy and inuiolable, it is no credible matter, that two Maidens durst assayle three men: but I see who hath most cause to complaine. It were then better, Madame (sayd Syr Fleur d'Amour ) that you should dismisse vs of the court, with straight defence to proceede any further, vpon payne to be punished as perturbers of publike peace. I appeale (sayd Mistresse Mary ) for I will neuer consent you shall so lightly cary away the siluer game, but doo require it may be permitted vnto me to defende the cause of women, who were yesterday so greatly blamed by you. It is a great matter, replied Sir bel A çcueil , how these Maidens continually desire quarels and contention: but as the Poets affirme, Mars the God of warre was borne of Juno , without any company of man, to declare that women alonely by their proper motion without any prouocation of men, do forge debates, which is in mine opinion, the cause wherfore ye Turkes would suffer no women to enter into their Paradise. Is that possible, said the Lady, I pray you report more of these newes vnto vs. Then ech one tooke his place at the table,  & the Gentleman began to declare briefly, how two Angells, being sente from God, to come and viewe how all things were demeaned here belowe, they trauailed towardes Egipt, where they sawe a woman of excellent beautie, who was walking all alone vnto hir Farme house, whose beauty so rauished them, as they esteemed the Heauens vnhappye in respecte of the Earthe. And communicating the one to the other, their newe conceyued affection, (for Spirites knowe all, and nothing maye be dissembled or hidden from them) they consented to be companions in loue. Wherefore feeling their desire to kindle, the nearer they approched vnto this burning obiecte, they coulde not so well maister their wills, as hauing ouertaken the Dame, they requyred hir not of loue, declaring vnto hir, that shee shoulde pleasure no vile persons, for they were Angells of Heauenly Nature (as they gaue hir presently certaine testimony,) and woulde not be vngratefull to acknowlege thys courtesie, and that she should finde it so, they graunted hir whatsoeuer she woulde demaunde. Wherevnto the dame (who esteemed not these diuinities worthy of hir fauoure, for women are of suche nature, as they make none accompte of an honeste suter, commending more some loutishe clowne, as wee see among Wolues, the bitche maketh hir choice of the moste vile, leane, and deformed dog,) made answere, that shee thought hir person greately honoured of so gamefull a match, and was readye to reste in all, and by all meanes at their will and pleasure, so that for their partes they woulde keepe their promise: Wherof she woulde be assured, before she woulde passe anye further, bycause she had no such power of constraint ouer them, as they had vpon hir. Nowe the requeste she made vnto them in liew of hir loue, was, that they shoulde learne hir the prayer whiche they said to mount into Heauen. Wherevnto the Angels chafing in their harnesse, willinglye agreed, and tolde it hir worde by worde, so distinctly, as the woman pronouncing it, felte hir selfe sodainely eleuate by an vnknowen force: whereof the Angells astonied, and acknowleging their faulte, ranne after to staye hir, saying vnto hir, that Cupido dwelt not anye more in heauen. But as when birds in enmitie pursue eche other, ye whiche maketh most forceable  & swiftest wing, ouerflieth ye reste, so this woma rauished in spirit & body, through this new miracle, seeing ye foules pursue hir, had no recourse for hir safegard, but vnto hir oratio, which she babbled so by huddles, as ye angels (not hauing so nimble tungs as women) could not ouertake hir, but wer forced to tary far behind. Wherby it fortuned yt the little deuils & spirits of ye aire, which had charge to make ye sentinell in heaue, of whom some yt watch to espie at ye lowpe holes of euery star fastened thereto with a siluer chaine, as me tye Laterns to windowes, made outcrie yt they discouered fro far some vnaccustomed thing there seen: but they knew not what, & ech one asked his fellows aduise therein: for (said they) it is no angel, nor any of ye Tritons , or Giants , which sometime wold haue scaled heauen to win it, nor any deuil,  & yet it lacketh nothing but hornes, and in these argumentes fearing to be taken vnprouided they cried for feare, Arme, arme, arme. Then a mightie Balafer whiche was Corporal, came forth of ye body of ye guard, demauding Que Vala , vnto whom this terrible beast was shewed, stealing through the Watch  & was staid, bicause it knew not ye watchword, vntill the councels pleasure was knowen. The which being assembled, fel into great doubts: for (some said) it was a woman, & yt it was vnconuenient to conuey hir to the earth again, except we will haue hir disclose all that she hath seene here, for she had rather die, tha refraine babling, especially if she be charged to holde hir peace. Other wer of opinion to vse ye Monks order towards hir, which licence such as are priuie of the gouernmets to departe in peace. Wherevnto Destiny answered, yt the time was not yet expired. What now? (answered another) she must not be suffered to come here among vs, for by hir curiosities she wil neuer cease to sowe dissentio & debate among vs, & happily we may fal to quarreling who shal possesse hir. In fine, after many reasons alleaged of one parte & another, it was agreed, yt some place of abode shoulde be appointed for this importune woma, & ye most conuenient place yt might be deuised for hir, was the Moone, which hath bin so turmoiled by this wandering guest, as it hath had neuer since any rest, not knowing what forme to beare, or what countenance to shew, looking now with a full face, the wt halfe a face, & somtime hidden, making a longer & swifter course in one moneth, than al the other heauenly bodies in a whole yere: yet sometime this curious woma spieth & prieth to vnderstad what decrees passe in ye councels of the gods, fro whence being repulsed & depriued of hir purpose, she thundereth out threatning & iniurious garboiles, so as ye inflamed choller of hir mischeuous mind, which she disgorgeth in hir furious madnesse, is euidetly verefied by the rattling thuder & flashing lightning among vs here seene & heard, proceeding fro their enuious stomacke. And bycause ye superior bodies haue obtained by conset of a generall councell permission to imparte vnto their friends on earth some influence of their naturall good, or euil dispositio: It ensueth thervpon yt this woman being ye motiue intelligence of hir planet, imparteth hir naturall conditions vnto ye inferior creatures of hir kind (which are the wome of this world,) who therevpon are called Curious, Wandering, Mutable, Quarellous, & in one word to speake truly, Lunaticke . Wherfore of right they ought not to be receued into the habitatio of the blessed: for certainly al maner of other creatures shall sooner enter into this Paradise, tha a woman: for as we reade ye entrance of heauen, was denied to a woman, and the beast which carried Mahomet into Paradise, was receiued in, so wonderfully the gods fear this mischiefe. So as by yt which hath bin declared without prosecution of ye Angels punishmet for telling tales out of schoole, or without discourse at large what women do in Alcorans hell, (where they haue none other pleasure or pastime, but to accuse ye soules of poore men) we wil conclude, yt women are only sent vppon earth, to be a plague and torment vnto men: vnto whom God in recompence of the felicitie he hath imparted vnto them: hathe giuen thys mischiefe, for a strong counterpeise of so greate a benefitte: for alwayes hee mingleth the one with the other, fro whence springeth yt which ye wise Romaine said, if the world wer without wome, it shuld no more be a world of men, but of gods: but the heaues haue decreed yt with wome me shuld liue in paine, and without women, man cannot liue at al: thys euill is so necessarye. Whervnto maistresse Margarite answered. Sir, you muste seeke eares addicted to fictions, if you desire to aduaunce youre fables to estimation. For if they finde no better lodging, than in thys companye, they are like to haue colde harbor. But to ouerthrowe and destroy the foundation, whiche in your iudgement you haue so surely builded: I pray you if a woman were so great an euill as you affyrme, wherfore is it that the auncientes whiche haue liued so happily, haue had more women than men, that liue at this present? for if youre saying didde beare Palme, it woulde ensue, that hauyng hadde more women, they ought to haue more harme, and that they were most fooles among them whiche woulde haue moste women: whereof it muste be inferred, that Salomon surnamed the wise, was very foolishe to take a thousande, since hee had too muche of one. But of necessitie we muste be compelled to stay vppon thys false proposition, which we might easyly confute, if we would but slightlye vnrippe the matter, yea and approue that the originall euill is entred into the worlde, by the gate whiche man hathe opened thereunto: the which, neuerthelesse hath bin locked againe, by the remedy, that the woman hathe broughte in the happy houre whiche god hathe imparted vnto hir: for that it is saide, that the restorer, enimy to the maligne serpent; did spring of the seede of the woman, and not of the man. Ho loe good lorde, what an interpreter are you growne maistresse (replied Sire Bel Acoeueil ) I beleeue some spirite of diuination, yea one of the subtileste is entred into you, but I truste youre glose will be founde a graine to lighte: for touching that you alleadge the pluralitie of women whiche were among men in times paste, it is to be noted, it was for the small accompte menne made of them. So as the Turkes by the same reaso, haue as many as they can nourish,  & do vse them as their drudges: but to the end you shal not thinke that I build onely vpon the reasons and examples of Paynims, I praye you tel me, reade we in the holy scripture, that euer woman was honoured with holy baptisme? or that oure Lord commaunded they shoulde be admitted to come vnto the holy mistery of his blessed supper? And folowing the examples of the most excellent of the Apostles, hath he not expresly forbidden them all diuine actes, as to preach and teach, to shewe that they are vnworthy: and imitating thys example, the wise Bracmans chaced them out of their schooles. But to wade further, haue we in holy writings any testimony, that there be women in Paradyse? or haue you hearde speake of Angelesses, Cherubinesses, or Seraphinesses: the whiche not withstanding I knowe to bee an error of the Saduceans, whom the diuine wisedome hath satisfied. But it is euidently knowen, yt they receiue punishment in an other world, for the mischiefe they haue done vnto vs:  & if you demaund what, for their offences their tongues are drawne oute. Truly (said the lady) your tong hath none other thing to do, but blame others, in blaming to get comendation of wel saying: but a man cannot say wel in speaking amisse. Madam (answered the Gentleman) if I haue spoken too largely, I besech you excuse me: considering I am ye son of a woman, who hath left me this faire heritage. Althoughe I thinke (replied the Lady) you will neuer starte from vs, poore women, yet wil we make you holde youre peace. No, no (said ye Gentlewomen) hee is sufficiently punished for ye offence he hath done, for he hath dined byhart, for ye affection he had to speake euill of women. Thus you see (answered the Gentleman) that I liue not by Loue, as other do: then bega they al to laughe: & rising fro ye table, they walked two or three turnes about ye garde alleis: the went they to refresh the vnder the shadow of a Rosemary border, wher being al assebled, ye Lady holding a branch of Laurel, about ye which al kind of flowers were boud in fashion of an horne of abundace, she said vnto hir daughter. My friend, we remeber you promised to defend as largely ye cause of wome, as it was canuassed yesterday by these vngratious youths, which are come to make war against vs. And behold now ye houre wherein you must take your reuenge, assuring my selfe yt the whole copany wil not deny you (curteous audience.) Wherevnto the damoysell aunswered, Mother, (not calling hir Madam) as those that are so well taught, that to heare them, men wil say they are bastards) I humbly thanke you, that with your fauor you haue graunted me the thing I woulde haue demaunded. And since by the gifte of this scepter, you graunte and Permit me to assay to succor ye honor of women, for wante of so many good knights, which wer wont to defend them (whose race is dead, & in their places are sprung vp extortures, & sworn enemies of their good right,) I shal beseech this company to supplye my default, for I cofesse the peysant burthe of this charge, & the puissance of mine aduersarie, are more than sufficient to confute me, if I were not aided & succoured by the equitie of my cause, which of it selfe defendeth it selfe. The which (if it find any place in your good iudgement, as I truste it will) I firmely assure my selfe, yt as Ariadne with hir threed, or Sibilla with hir boughe, I shall conduct you with this scepter vnto the Mansion where the truth so long hidden dothe inhabite, the which sage Democritus searched in the bottome of a well. Giue then I pray you more regarde vnto my reasous (which haue none other stay to vpholde them, but the simple veritie,) than to the hony of the counterfeite words of mine aduersary, (who as the crafty fowler sweeteneth his voice to deceiue:) and do not like Midas , who praised more the sweetnesse of the pipe, than the grauitie of the lute. Also bycause (you men) are in this place Iudges in your own cause, suffer not your selues to be surmounted by particular affection, as Teresias did, who was blind both in spirite, and body. And remeber what torture the son of Cirus caused the wicked iudge to endure. I beseech you also mother (whose singular prudence oughte to moderate our controuersie) to imitate the excellent Monarch, who so long as the plaintife pleaded, did stop his one eare, saying he reserued it for the defendant, equally departing his fauor. And the it shall bee easie for me to declare, that the disasters whiche holde Loue at the bay, happen only by the defaults of men, as you may clearelye perceiue by the briefe discourse of a maruellous Historie, chaunced wythin a smal tyme. Then hauing made a little pause she began thus. It is no strange matter yt a totall, firmly coniuct  & assebled, should maintaine it selfe by his vnion, but also encrease in force & puissaunce, as the good father at his death instructed hys children, by the similitude of a bundle of arrowes wel bound togither. But it is a thing worthy of great admiration, to see one parte separate & dismembred from his totall, to shewe it selfe as puissaunt as if it were vnited, considering yt Nature (according to the opinion of Empedocles ) exerciseth none other mean to subuerte  & destroy al his creatures, but discord and disiunctio. This is the cause why it ought not to seeme wonderfull, though Rome being in times paste the head & best part of the world, hathe not only bin vanquished, but victorious ouer all. But all men maye with me be abashed, yt this Romaine Monarchie (hauing conquered it selfe by diuisions and partitions, and as the head of Hidra ) dismembred into so many peeces, yet the euery of the partes maintaineth it selfe so prosperously, as Almaine (where shineth the principall portion of the crowne of this Westerne Empire) is not onely feared aboue all of hir confines  & neighbors, but al the partes thereof, which resemble little Realmes, dare resiste the forces of most mighty princes, being preserued by a soueraigne wisedome, of right to elect such to gouerne them, as seeme meete in their conceits, wherin these little kings behaue them so well, as they locke the gate of ambition, knowing it is ye death and destruction of al estates and seigniories: Therof proceedeth the glorie of so many victories, wherwith this natio is honored. Therof groweth the abundant wealth wherein, euerye of these seigniories do flowe, & the beautifull Cities, wherwt they bee in euery part replenished. Now among the most noble & splendant Townes, wherby Almania is renowmed, Mens (in mine opinion) oughte of right to obtaine the firste place of praise, aswell for ye beautie of the buildings, as for the neighbourhoode of the riuer of Rhine : whiche causeth the trade and traffique to enriche it meruellouslye, and yeeldeth vnto it parte of the commodities of strange Countreys. There not long agone were two families of Marchauntes, notable among the rest, aswell for their gret welth, as auntient reputatio. Of whom ye one had one only son named Harman , very vertuous, curteous,  & wel accomplished with natures gifts as might be desired: the other an only daughter beautifull & wel taught, called Fleuria . These marchants (as men see ordinarily,) that like will to like (if enuie gainsay it not) were destined to vnite their houses, by the alliance of their children, whervnto it seemed the heauenly decrees did lend their dub consents, hauing indued the two parties with equall age, goods, beautie,  & conditions, & also like & conforme in Loue, as farforth as their childehoode could permit, the which hauyng from theyr tender youth happily planted their deepe rootes being carefullye sowed by the priuities of a mutuall conuersation, aspired to none other end for his perfection, tha to product of this flower desired fruit, & to aduace the season according to the ardent desire & deuotion of the parents. But alas, when they were at point to alter this pleasant hope into assurance, fortune was opposite to so great good hap. For you shall vnderstande (gratious companye) that in the house of the maiden there dwelt a gallant yong prentize named Ponifre , who being his maisters factour  & foreman of the shop, had often tymes none other businesse but to beholde passengers, and to marke among women, whose beautie gained the principall seate in hys particular iudgement, & by hymselfe to choose what death he had lieuest dye. But after long & attentiue choices, he confessed in his hart, that the saint sought so far, was harde at hande: For wythout doubte his yong maistresse surpassed as far the reste of the Townish damoysels, as ye Moone surmounted the brightest starres. And indeede she contented his fantasie so exceedingly, as whether hee had fixed his eie too earnestly vpon hir, (which men say serueth for the principal presage in Loue) or whether the thing it selfe was such, as it costrained him to surrender his consent, or whether his loytering leysure induced hym to occupy hys ydle braine, and to busie himselfe, he could not do otherwyse, than from thenceforth without contradiction abadon his body and soule vnto the mercy of Loue, who after he hadde for a season kepte hym at the baye, and fedde him the firste course of his ordinary table, which are mute regardes, vncertaine sighs, melancoly conceites, with a silence which trasporteth the spirite a mile beyonde the worlds ende, gaue him an appetite vnto more delicate foode, and fed hym with more nourishing dainties. So as the faire fire of Fleuria , being so neare hym, embraced him so liuely, as it constrained him to determine a resolution too hautie for his feeble forces, that is to saye, to require of hir the guages, whiche they that fight vnder the ensignes of Loue, doe accepte for their safety. And howe muche more the mistrust of him selfe, recoyled his intentions by foolishe feare, so muche more sharply this proude tamer of spirites girded him in the flanke with the spurres, as he was forced to flee all difficultie, whatsoeuer might be manyfest. O howe willingly he called hir Mistresse, bicause that tearme is customarie to louers: but more gladly assayed he to make his words effectuall by some seruisable dutie. Notwithstanding, the simple Maiden, who knewe not what loue ment, regarded not his courtesies, neither had the capacitie to marke I know not what particular affection: The whyche the Factor considering, incontinently made his reckning that it behoued him to speake clearely, and not betweene his teeth, if he would practise surely, and make a happy conquest of hir good graces. Wherefore with newe apparell, taking newe counsayle, he made him fine and braue, he kembed, he froted, he frisled, and prinked him in his glasse, and carefully set euery poynt in as neate maner as loue could instruct him: then beeing disposed vnto all hardinesse, he sought time and place to take hir alone, where finding hir, with a trembling toung he discouered vnto hir in as good order as he could possibly, all that he had heard saye of the forces of loue, which spared no person, yea and that which is worse, without any discretio this blinde God delighteth to allie small things wt great, forcing kings to fauor popular beautie,  & for his pastime constrayneth Goddesses to abandon the heauens, to embrace the pleasure of a gentle Shephearde in his rusticall cottage. Wherefore Mistresse (sayde he) I beseeche you thinke it not straunge, if the perfections which nature hath bestowed on you, to make men meruayle at hir giftes in you, haue so subiected and forced my youthfull desires, as for my last refuge I am constrayned to implore your pitifull grace? Alas Mistresse, I know well you esteeme me very rashe and vnaduised to plant mine affections in so hawty degree: but I can rightly aduertise you, that if you accept nothing but that which is worthy of your beautie, you muste ascende into heauen, for it is neuer to be founde here belowe. With suche and like talke this young man would haue persuaded his newe Mistresse, vntill with a cruell looke and shamefast countenaunce, enflamed with choler and disdayne, she closed his mouth, and after a rude threatning, gaue him suche a bone of repentaunce to chewe vpon, for his too headlong hardynesse, as beeing left alone, hauing by silence supported a pearcing rage, he resembled one of the damned soules in time past that Jupiter threwe into the bottomlesse lake by force of his vengeable lightning, seeing nowe his way closed vp by the which other louers founde the most sure accesse vnto the ende of their desires. For since Maydens which harken, and castels that consent to parle (as the Prouerbe sayth) doo easily agree to composition, it ensueth rightly that a deafe woman is vneasie to winne. Alas, although this blinde louer seeth and confesseth these things to be true, neuerthelesse resolued in his obstinate desire, he had this good determination, somewhat to season his trauayled vaynes, that he woulde neuer lose his courage, but would make full accompt, that obstinate time, whiche surmounteth all, might likewise surmount the most rebellious chastities, considering that women do gladly yeeld their fauours vnto a stedfast and faithfull suter. But what? (sayd he, comforting him selfe) the Grecians lay before Troy tenne yeeres, and yet in the ende it was taken, euen when they thought it moste impregnable, and the enimies had raised their siege. So though the takyng of thys fortresse bee difficill, yet it is harde to saye, that it is vnpossible to bee wonne. Good hearte then take courage, the victorie is so muche more glorious, as the fight is painefull and dangerous, and happily one good houre maye chaunce vnlooked for. What? is it not often seene, that the Hare which could not be taken by Grayhoundes in course, thrusteth hir head into ye snare which is laide for hir. Under these persuasions the louer sought all meanes to bring his purpose to effect, but (God saue the Moone from the Wolfe) it profited as muche as if he had washed a crow to make hir white. For as the prudent Greekes stopped their eares against the enchauting songs of the pyping Syrenes : so likewise this vertuous youngling, (whose sage youth ought to be a myrror vnto ye eldest) made hir hearing deafe vnto his sugred talke, imitating the prudent Aspe , who as the princely Prophet sayth, stoppeth hir eare with hir tayle, that she may not heare the sound of hir deceitfull enemie. The which gaue our suter cause, to thinke that which he had often heard say, that what demeanour or countenaunce soeuer Maidens shew, they are very easie to be loued, esteeming them selues louely. And yet shame founded vpon I knowe not what opinion of honour, suffereth them not to agree vnto that which chiefly they desire, which causeth them the to craue willingly yt men shuld force the, therby to shadow their willing cosentes. Wherof the example of Medea, Helene, Ariadne ,  & a thousande millions moe (that haue caused them selues to be rauished) doth beare witnesse. For this cause he thought it great folly to consume himselfe with hope, and perpetually to languish in beleefe and excessiue expences, wherat his suttle Loue might happily smile in hir sleeue, but rather to abado al cowardlinesse, and to seaze vpon his pray by a delicate force in assurance of his pretended good luck. But this vnaduised folly brued his owne bane, & put his life in hazard, for at the cry of the maiden the mother came running, vnto whom at the first blushe she purposed to accuse this violence, & to sell dearely the foolish enterprise of this importune princox. Neuerthelesse, sodenly considering the sequele and importance of the fact, she thought it better at that instaunt to proceede therein more gently: for if she had purchased so great mischefe to him, which offended not but by too much loue, what would she haue don to hir enimie? Wherfore fayning a feare, for it was in a dark corner, by hir sage dissimulation she conuerted al choler into laughter. Ah inuincible chastitie, oughtest thou to haue bin accompanied with so great curtesie as in place of coplaint which thy right deserued, to passe wt ieste that which deserued cruel vengeance? Alas that thy gret bounty cost thee so deare, for in sparing thy foolish friend thou haste lefte I know not what hope, which thou oughtest to haue rashed vp by the rootes, knowing that a small sparke of fyre, remayning is sufficient to renue the flame which al men supposed to be extinct. Behold now our braue Louer to al seeming ouerthrowen without recouerie, where he lyeth frustrate of all sense, seeing his sighes vanished in the ayre, his paynes vngratefully loste, and so euill successe of his attempt. Notwithstanding, hoping in despight of all hope, although he coulde catche nothing, neither at the bounde nor volue, and that this flinty chastitie (more able to repaire, than hir assailaunt to make breache,) daye by day shaped him newe businesse, determined to ayde his suite by some Dariolet , which men call by cleanly conueiaunce, furtherers of loue, but in playne tearmes, bawdes. I woulde not speake thus grossely, if the perfection of mine historie bounde me not thereto, to shew you that this prentice in Loue grewe suche a graund master at the first blowe, as he forgot no practise, and was furnished of this meane, esteeming it most expedient: for besides that he had heard saye, howe these abusers were expert to make traffique of such miserable marchaundize, conducting people to hell, like vnto Sibilla in olde time, they seemed to him very necessarie to take away the vayle of shame, which onely hindered Fleuria to say yea. In this deuotion one Sonday comming to the parish church, he bourded an olde mother Bee, who solde candell of consideraunce, praying hir to giue him light in this businesse, the mistinesse whereof troubled his braynes very sore. Wherevnto she willingly agreed, (as in deede they are no nigardes of promises) and for the effect thereof assigned him a certayne place of meeting, after highe Masse was ended: during whiche time his eyes, greedily fixed vpon his faire Mistresse, solde vnto him (as men say) the skin before the beast is taken, assuring him selfe of the thing, wherof he was most vnassured. The houre expired, with diligence he went to finde this olde Gibbe, vnto whom in fourme of auricular confession, he vnripped the whole matter from ende to ende, crauing hir aduice what meane was moste expedient to bring to effect his obstinate conclusion, whiche was, eyther to dye or enioy his Ladies loue, wherevnto their dayly conuersation, beeing both harbored vnder one roofe, did neyther yeelde fauour nor aduauntage (as it chaunceth very oft, that those of most familiar acquaintance, willingly loue little.) Furthermore, that he had to deale with a partie whose rigorous condicions and sterne complextion, beside the diligent attendance of a mother, whose carefull eye continuallye watched hir, as the Dragon the golden apples of Hesperia , gainsayde all hope. Then aunswered olde Beldame: very well, it is all one, let me deale, if she will not yeelde by nature, I will compell hir by hooke or crooke. Discomforte not your selfe for the matter, for there is nothing but maye be finished by trauaile. She is not more terrible than Lions or Tygres, which in time are tamed and brought to hande. But take this for an article of your Crede, you must be secret in all your doings, and neuer report any thing of a woman till hir funerall. As a healthfull medicine taken by the pacient that is desirous of recouerie, driueth away the burning feuer, which scaldeth his weake lymmes, euen so this consolation did moderate the impacient desires, which like an vnbrydled horse caried away their maister. And vpon this assurance Ponifre gaue a golden fee vnto his olde attorney, who watching hir time, employed all hir wicked inuentions which she had by long vse and practise collected. But in fewe wordes to shewe you, all hir sorceries serued to so small effect, and euery thing fell out so contrarie and discordant to the purpose, as in fine perceyuing she was short of the reckening which she thought to haue raised vnto hir total sum, she was constrained to surrender a piteous aunswere vnto hir Client, yeelding him as great ioy as the sentence of death pronounced vppon a criminall offender, wherewith he was so touched to the quicke, as from thenceforth he had consented vnto his proper ruine, seeing all his deuises succeede so peruersly as if he had bene borne in the wane of the Moone, but that he sodenly conceyued in his fantasie (as he that desired to leaue no stone vnturned, but to prooue euery practice) that it behoued him yet to obtaine the aide of a Magician, vnto whom he imagined nothing to be vnpossible: The coniurer demaunding in hand a round sum of money (which he would finger before he would meddle with the matter) assigned, thys miserable louer a time  & place, where by the efficacy of certain carrecters he would enforce his cruel mistresse in hir despight to yeeld hir person at his commaundement and pleasure. The leping out of his lobby in deformed order, barhead & barefoot, making diuerse turnes and returnes aboute a churchyard, mumbling the Diuels paternoster, like an old ape, composing certaine pointes with a wand in the dust, he did so muche by force of his coniurations, shewes, exorcismes and inuocatios, as he charmed the immaginatiue fantasie of his man, in such sort as he caused him to lye with a shadowe whiche by nigromancie he had intierly forced to take the shape of Floria . During this false delight, the inchaunted louer distraughtly beheld with stedfast eyes the faire semblaunce of his louer, now maruelling at the beautiful curles of hir frisled heare, then at hir angelical face, now at hyr allabastrine throte, then at hir round delicate dugs, nowe at hir Iuorine armes and al other partes which perfect beautie rendereth meruellous, so as after he had made a superficiall anothomy of thys prety miracle, al rauished wyth contentment, he would haue thrown his amorous armes about the necke of this fained beautie: but ye inchautment being now approched vnto the terme appointed thervnto by the sorcerer, sodainely finished, so as this beautiful body vanished awaye amid the imbrasing of hir amorous louer, like vnto a bubble of water caused by a puffe of winde: and all this pleasure passed like a shadowe or a dreame in the night, leauing the poore senselesse sot so astonied, as if by good fortune he had not bin laid, he had tubled backward in a soud. And I beleeue this charme whose strange effecte I haue recited, shal not seeme vnto you (honourable audience,) erring fro ye truth, if you haue neuer so smal regard vnto the power whiche God hath giuen the Diuell to tempt, euen those whome he most loueth, as we haue examples in holye bookes. And if you be remembred, the most auntient histories make mention, that English Merlin was begotten betwixte the Diuel and a woman:  & before him deuine Plato was coceiued of a Uirgine by a spirite: wherunto that agreeth which is written of the women of Gothes , who in the deserts of Scithia were gotten wyth child by shadowes  & forrest Diuels. We may annexe herevnto the tale which Cardanus reporteth of a Scotish woman who a familiar spirite vsed to accompanie carnally, by whom she was deliuered of a moster. The like happened not long sithece vnto Magdalene the daughter of Constancius . Notwithstanding, my Historie passeth not so far forth: as I wil maintayne that they can ingender, aswel bycause our religion defendeth vs to belieue that anye but Iesus Christe alone, was euer borne without the seede of man, as also bycause nature hath not imparted to spirites distinction of kinde: but I can iustly affirme, aswel by the example of this true Historie, as by the authority of good authours, especiacly of Lactantius , that they maye haue carnall communication, to contaminate and polute humaine creatures, vnto whom they are protested and sworne enimies. Let vs not then thinke it vnpossible that the maligne serpent, who (as Saint Paul sayth) transformeth hys shape into an Angel of lighte to deceiue vs, wyll not also resemble the personage of an Harlot, to glut in the vnsatiable delight of lubricitye, the sinner whom he had already wonne, and minister the meane vnto him to execute the wickednesse first conspired in his hart. Nowe to returne to our Ponifre . After he had long tyme remayned in a sweating extasie wythout knowledge of hymselfe at last, by little and little he opened the eyes of hys vnderstanding, and acknowledging that since hee hadde betaken his credite vnto a deceiuer, it was no meruayle though he hadde payde hym with hys coyne, whyche is, Illusion and false semblaunte. Wherefore partlye ashamed, and partely dyspyghted of hys dotishe errours, hee arose, and in place to desyste from hys vnfortunate pursute, he entertained an enraged wyll to persyste more effectuallye than before, iudgyng that worse coulde not lightlye happen vnto hym. Thus hardening his heart against his owne mischiefe, he broched his wittes to inuent newe meanes. First he intended to experiment Paris herbe, or foure leaued grasse, or the composition of some witchcraft to induce hir loue, esteeming the famous meane to be true, wherewith Venus coupleth louers, or the true doue which she gaue to Iason , to winne the fauour of Medea , although Pindarus seemed to vnderstande it otherwise, or the very apples wherewith runnagate Attalanta was stayed and taken. Notwithstanding, premeditating the inconueniences which ensued such ministrations, whereby many by their vndiscrete zeale haue deliuered death for loue, as Deianira , and Lucretia , the Poets beare witnesse, by their peruerse aduentures, he woulde not hazarde hir vnto the mercy of poyson, for whome he endured a thousande deathes. But as there is nothing so malicious or vnnaturall, which findeth not place in the heart of man, and principally of him whiche abandoneth his reason vnto his vnbrideled appetites, he concluded for the last meane, to ayde his follye by a wickednesse so monstrous and horrible, as the Deuils good grace durst neuer haue premised: Which was, to find meanes eyther by mony or fayre promises, or by other subtill deuises to wynne the maides of the house, which without great paines yeelded their good willes, so inclined to his deuotion, as they promised all their fauours and assistance so farre forth as their promise coulde extende. And vpon this wicked foundation they raysed a peruerse building, for they conspired togither to make the poore virgin drunken, the next day hir mother shoulde be from home, which was easie for them to do, aswell for the credite she had in these trayterous chamberers, who brewed hir beuerage with some secret mixture, as also bicause the maner and custome of the countrie permitteth, yea, and accounteth it a vertue to drinke deuoutly, whiche might somewhat excuse hir. Oh howe wise were our forefathers to forbidde wyne so strictly vnto their children, and much more to their wiues, so that for drinking wine, they deserued defame, and being taken with the maner, it was lawfull to kisse their mouthes, whereas otherwise men kissed but their eyes, to shewe that wine drinkers were apt to further offence. And this vse was ordeyned, as though wine wrapped secretes so, that to kysse a woman on the mouth, signified the speache of their soules by the windowes thereof. Euen so by the lawe of Moses a father alledged a very sufficient reason vnto the people to stone hys sonne to death, accusing him to be a drunkarde. For in deede if we will search the mischiefes that proceede of wine, we shal conclude that sithence Noe thought he had done euill in planting the vine, Licurgus of good right caused it to be rooted vp, as finding no greater enimie of humaine reason than wyne, sithence it resembleth men vnto beastes, some vnto Lions, as Alexander, who by the only vice of dronkennesse reformed yet by a sodain repentaunce, darkened al the splendant Uertues which made him so to shyne: other into swyne, as Marke Anthonie , and many moe. Let vs not then finde it strange though the simple youth of this Almaine damosell, hauing taken too much wine, yelded hir body vnto the shamelesse luxurie of hir suter, who fynding this poore creature abandoned to hys wyll and discreation, had a comodious season to glut his vnbrideled and cormorant desire with the aide of the Chaberers, ministers of his infamous voluptuousnesse. And it is no cause of abashment though this wicked wretch toke pleasure to defile a masse of fleshe allenate from all sensibility, sithence that sensualitie hath oftentimes so enraged diuerse, as it hath imboldned them to quench their gredy lubricity vpon dead carcasses, which liuing made liuely resistace vnto their leudenes. Wherfore the enraged thirst of this brutall louer caused this troubled water to seeme so delightful vnto him, yt of this coiunctio proceeded a conception of childe, the vnknown burthen wherof so abashed our simple Floria , ignorant from whence she had pylfered hir packe, as she supposed, that nature being offended would procreat in hir some prodigeous Monster, making hir a mother before she was a wife. And when time (which ripeneth all fruites) had so swolne hir prety belly, as she coulde no longer hide it, all drowned in teares, she declared vnto hir mother that she thought hir self with child, hauing neuerthelesse neuer had the knowledge of man: wherat the mother beyng grieuously displeased, vsed the equitie and right giuen vnto hir by nature: but seing there was no remedie in an act committed, but that according to the wise mans saying, a myschief must be prudently preuented, and being once happened, patiently supported, she assayed by threatnings, compulsion, and many other meanes, to make hir daughter disclose the author of thys infamy, to the ende shee might in time prouyde and procure some reparation of hir credite. But the poore wenche being at that instant wholy bereaued of remembrace, persisted in hir ignoraunce, affirming she knew not how she came in that case, neyther had felt any thing belonging thervnto. Neuerthelesse she felt right well the paines of hir trauaile which she supported very couragiously, as she who being euyll experimented in so extreame passions, attended steadfastly that wished death woulde performe a violent end of hir life, and vndeserued shame: for you shall note (gracious companie) that although all things were as secretely conuayed as was possible, yet was the fame therof imediately blased abroade, for birdes (as those that bewrayed the death of Pallades ,) or dogges (as that which disclosed and reuenged the mind of his maister, before the king of Persia ) wil rather speake, tha such affaires shoulde be vndiscouered. Which was the cause, that through the town all men talked of Floria hir beyng with childe, and if two persons were seene whispering togither, it was easie to deuine wherevpon they spake. The which so greatly grieued the yong gentleman Herman (who loued Floria feruently, and pretended to wedde hir, as I haue recited in the beginning of myne historie) as for sorowe and anger to heare such sinister reportes, he departed into the countrie, where leading a solitarie life, he began bitterly to repent the great loue he had imparted vnto a creature so disloyall, as by a faire semblant yeelded apparance of an incomparable chastitie: but like suche as comming to a feast with full stomacks, shewe small appetite before the worlde, and in corners fraunch in their nuncions franklye. Then remembring the graces  & perfect lineaments before time marked in his Floria , loue constrained him to accuse his rigorous opinion, to excuse hir whom euery man blamed: and lyke a blind man this louer bounde closely his eyes, least he shoulde viewe the acte which haply might blemishe his sight, so as his mynde being turmoyled in vncertaine iudgements, he surrendred the aduatage of his cause vnto peruerse equity. Alas said he (biting his tongue) must I not terme all women deceyuers, sithence by this I haue bene abused?  & say that what fained likelyhood so euer they shew, their flitting fantasies entertaineth loue no longer than they behold the thing beloued so as with the presence they lose all remembrance, yeelding their fauors immediatly to euery one as their leysures serue them, like vnto looking glasses which indifferently represent all figures and impressions so long as the bodies are opposit and obiect before the, the which, such glasses are sodainly ready to forgo, to dispose the to represent other shapes presented before them. And herein ye testimony of the wise king of Juda maye satisfie vs, who called the vnsatiable gulfs. So as it is a gret ouerwening vnto a ma to promise himself a shamefast woma, cosidering it is a thing rarer than the only Phenix . Neuer could ye mightiest Emperours yt euer bare crowne encounter so great a tresure. True it is (according to the opinio of those yt wish them most good) yt shee maye be almost chast, yt hath nothing wherfore to be required, nor hath neuer had the hardines to require. In so much (as by the prudent Romain Emperour) the good disuigured, resebleth the hen whose plumage is despised  & the flesh estemed: but the beautifull woman is like the Ermine , whose skinne is estimable, and carcas carion. So as there is so great enmity betwixt beauty  & bounty, as they neuer remaine togither in one mansion. And al that is reported of Lucresia, Cassadra ,  & others, are but fayned fables. Wherfore we must conclude, that nature hath engendered the worme to gnaw vpon our dead carcases, & wome to feed vpo our liuing bodies, our substance & renoume, giuing the fredome to liue among me as vnprofitable dranes amog bees. Thus this desolate louer discharged his sorow, & vometed his venim against womakind. Nowe this rural life in short time made him loke so pale and deformed, as it pitied al such as saw him: the cause wherof being known vnto his father, gaue him occasio to determin some meanes for the prouision of his sons health. And calling him into his closet secretely, he shewed him howe much Floria had forgotten hir duetie by a crime sufficient inough to breake of the alliaunce which before time they had attempted. Wherefore, sayde he vnto him, choose thee one among the troupes of townysh virgins whom thou best fanciest, to recompence the wrongs of Floria . Wherfore Herman , as one wel taught, rededered his will vnto the good pleasure of his father, of whose graue cousel he determined to make experience, vtterli renoucing his owne fonde fantasie: which caused the good olde man in shorte time to finde out a beautifull and riche wife for hys sonne, discended of worshipful linage, named Carita : whereof ensued a sodain mariage, with so happy entraunce into housekeping, as all theyr couetousnesse was onely to reioyce theyr mindes with the tender imbrasings and delicate courtesies reserued in the storehouse of loue, employing diligently the good season for feare of future stormes, watering the fragrant flours of the yong spring: So as after ye example of the auntient Captaine Pericles , they neuer wente abroade or returned home, without billing and beaking like wanto Doues, vntil such time as whe a ma is werie of his own ease (for ofte swete meates cloye the stomacke) the yong husband determined to take truce with loue,  & for a season to forsake his Carita , to the ende to imploye hys trauaile in the trade of marchandise: for whych cause he ioyned his stocke with certain of hys friends, entending to go wyth them vnto the mart at Antwerp, there to seeke his profite. But when he came to the point to imparte his enterprise to his Carita , hys wordes foltered in his mouth: Yet seing the master required present dispatch, and that hys companions were readie, one night holding hir betwene hys armes, for possible he was not so hardye by the day light, he said: my deare friend, when I reuolue in my minde the estate wherevnto God hath called me, I cannot content me with the ydell life I leade frustrate of all trauayle, especially in these my youthfull yeres wherin I flourishe, in which the wise haue bin accustomed to make their prouision of substance, whereby to liue quietly at ease in their age, after the example of the pretie Ante, which laboreth in sommer, foreseeing that winter wyll come. And although we haue atchieued some smal welth, which is not yet so great, but in spending therof dayly, and increasing nothing, will soone be consumed: so it is, that as we haue bene carefully prouided for by our friends, so must we prouide for such as shall succeede vs, and it is not time to buylde the barne when the corne is ready to be layde therein. Wherefore sweete heart, it is high time, that for the maintenaunce of our porte, I vse mine endeuour, and lothing this vprofitable life, beginne to exercise some traffique, and make a viage into Englande, after the marte of Antwerpe be ended, where I may reape some benefite. And besides, by that meanes may see and learne by the frequentation of straungers, that whiche the fonde loue of my Parentes hath not permitted me to vnderstande, bicause they coulde neuer suffer me out of their sightes. Whervnto fayre Charita , who during this discourse had hir minde moued with many passions, aunswered: O God sweete loue finde you already suche annoyaunce in marriage, as you can not endure the expiring of the yeare, according to the auncient custome, the whiche giueth to others priuiledge and dispensation of the exercise of their vacation? Or are you suche an enemie to your selfe, as like a madde man, you seeke reste in trauayle, pleasure in payne, comfort in affliction, and safetie in perill? for if you knowe well with what wood trauaylers are warmed, and vnto what hazardes they commit their laboursome life, I can not imagine but you hate me in so earnestly seeking your owne destruction. Alas that the estate of worldelinges should be so miserable and vncertayne, to reape greefe where they searche for ioye. Alas, when I was a mayde I had no sorrowe, but that my selfe procured: then mighte I leape where I lysted, lyke a young Heyfer, which neuer felt the compulsion of the yoke: but nowe that I haue renounced my naturall freedome, to cast the anker of the pleasures of this lyfe vpon mariage, I haue bounde my selfe to receyue the torment which is giuen me by another. O that it were so, as man and wife being but one body, I had the moytie of you, as you possesse the one halfe of me in your own right, and the other by my free consent: I would at least require you to let me enioy the moytie due and requisite vnto me ouer you. Ah will you play the Lions parte, and dispose the totall to my preiudice and disaduantage? Then she ceased hir words with a close kisse, and taking newe heart a grace, beganne agayne: Well (sayd she) you are already glutted with one meate, and seeke to refreshe your appetite with chaunge of diet, so as your loue ranging with you in your voyage, wil practise some new friende, who by hir newe flame may mortifie my fire, which is nowe too olde for you. In the meane season, I wil attende you here in feare, lest any euill chaunce forslow your desired returne. Alas, if you be so desirous to see strange countreys, what shal hinder me in a ladds aray to lackey by your horse, sithence the wife of Metridates disdayned not to doo the like? Otherwise, if you leaue me here, I shall esteeme the countrey wiues estate better than mine, for they at lest see their husbandes at euen, when they returne from their day labour. Thus the apprehension of this departure warmed the tender hart of this louing girle, no more nor lesse, than a fierie furnace prouoked by the blastes of bellowes, and by the vehemencie of this heate, the scalding teares trickled downe amaine, like a clowde in the spring time before the sunne beames. The yong husband feeling this warme deaw fall vpon his face, said vnto hir: Truely minion, I must needs say, you loue me not as other wome loue their husbands, sithece you mistrust me in the conseruation of our loue, hauing neuer ministred the lest occasion, whervpo you may ground any such suspition, beeing a thing so far from my thought, as I desire that the fire of heauen may sooner consume me, than the loue of any other should kindle in my heart, to giue me desire to make a false bounde, or mayme the fayth of our mariage: assuring you, that your loue in respect to ware olde in me, shall growe young, as Painters discipher it, who giue there vnto the shape of a childe. And if you alleage that they paint it with wings, to declare that it is light and wandering, I confesse vnto you, my loue was suche, but so soone as you had berefte me therof, by the prouidence of my happie destinie, you clipped his wings, so that neuer since it coulde flye but about you, like as a yong lasse vseth a butterflye, that it may not flie from hir. Wherefore feare not, I pray you, that the chaunge of ayre  & countrey can alter mine affection towards you: but imagine, that as the fire continueth hir heate vnder the cinders, so my loue shal encrease vnder the secret remebraunce of you: and at my returne you shal finde it so augmented, as your selfe will say, I com to traffike in the land of loue. Thus the good Herman coforted curteous Charita , who began to steale patiece,  & clasping his neck betwixt hir languishing armes, sayde: My deare friend, you haue full power to dispose both of your selfe, & me, according to your discretion, for your plesure is my only contentment. But thus farfoorth I wil enforme you, that sithence you refuse to carye my corps with you, my hart & sincere affections shall accopany you mauger your denial, the which although they be infinite in nuber, yet shal they neuer abandon your seruice. For if you saile, they shal rest on the poupe: if you ride, they shall sitte on the crouper: if you trauel on foote, they shal attend vpon you like faithfull Lackeis. Vpon these speeches, with a thousande embracings, they confirmed a determinate resolutio. The Seigneur Herman hauing prepared al thing necessary for his voyage, with much adoo tooke leaue of his newe wife for sixe moneths. But alas, if he had bin truly aduertised of his pityfull aduenture, he had saide adue for euer, as he that should neuer haue seene hir agayne: whom he left in the custodie of his brother, to see hir safe conueyed to spires , vnto hir vncle, with whom she might passe ouer the greefe, whiche the absence of hir loue procured. Nowe let vs omitte the happie successe of Herman , running his course so long as it pleased dame Fortune, and returne a whyle to visyte Floria , who ashamed of hir childes birth, as yrked to lyue after the deathe of hir honoure, had committed hir person vnto voluntarie imprisonment, spending hir life in so great anguishe, as it was a verie lamentable case to beholde the perplexitie she suffered, principally when the auncient loue of Herman visited hir memorie. Alas (sayde she) why dyd the heauens predestinate so great good vnto me, to suffer me nowe to shewe my selfe so vnworthy thereof? Why dyd they not rather grinde me to powder with thunderboltes, or at least cutte the threede of my life amidde my felicitie? Alas Herman , my deare Herman , oughtest thou by right to haue harboured thy young affections in so leawde a lodging? My disaster hath forced thee (I knowe to thy great greefe) to seeke a meeter matche. Notwithstanding, is it good reason, sithence my straunge mischance hath so conspired, that I lay the wrong on mine owne necke, and consent vnto mine vniuste punishement. Liue then deare friende, liue for euer blessed with thy Charita , and in recompence of the weale I wishe thee, praye that God may graunt a quicke dispatche of the torment I endure for thy sake. Thus the desolate Louer complayned continually, graunting no tearme or ende vnto hir teares and sighes. Wherewith hir mother greeuously molested, whereas before she thundred out threatnings, nowe she assayeth by all meanes to comfort hir. Of the which the best (in hir conceyte) was to prouide hir a husbande, wherein she employed hir vttermoste power: but, as a beautyfull glasse, whiche whylome shined vppon a Cupborde for the brauerie of a banquet, as soone as it catcheth a cracke is depriued of place, and throwen into some contemplatiue corner: Euen so this beautie, whiche before was required of all men, nowe lyeth disdayned of euery man. The whiche the poore mother perceyuing, deuised to make hir factour Ponifre , (whom shee tooke for an honest young man) hir sonne in lawe: who vppon the firste motion, made the matter straunge, and counterfayted his knauerie so cunningly, as he woulde not bende his eare to his olde Mistresses Musicke. Notwithstanding, in fine she broughte him with much intreatie to make halfe a graunt. But the greatest paine was employed to win Floria , who obstinate in hir cruell purpose, entended to amend hir offence with perpetuall penaunce: Untill in fine, vanquished by the instante requestes of all hir kinsfolkes, and coniured by the reuerence which she oughte to hir mother, she condiscended to the marriage, whiche was speedily dispatched by the good olde woman, who scholing Ponifre , shewed him what credite he was come vnto, by hir means: this oughte to moue thee, (quoth she) neuer to reproue my daughter of hir passed crime, or to beare hir any malice therefore: if thou do otherwise, thou shalte be like him that spitteth againste the winde, whose slauer fleeth in his owne face, and for my parte, assure thee of my continual displeasure. Then cooling hir daughters courage by the representation and remembraunce of hir lewde gouernement, so contrary to the good nouriture she had receiued, commaunding hir to be faithfull and obedient to hir husbande, the wedding was solemnised with greate magnificence, whereat the husbande being aduaunced vnto his desired estate, was so rauished with ioy and contentment, that by hys example hee inuited the whole assemblye to mirth. Nowe if this mariage were begun with great pleasure, the continuance thereof was yet more delightfull, for that eche daye ensuing other, prepared newe pastimes, the seconde surmounting the firste, and so in order, vntill by mishappe the bridegrome one daye making a banquet for his familiars, forgatte himselfe so deepely, as summoning eche one to quaffe his carouse, and answering euerie one by measure, according to the custome of the country, hee drunke so freely, as he forgat not to call for musicke  & dauncing after dinner, & so bestirred him in euery other businesse, as being throughly chaffed with heate and drinke, hee began in slauering good faith to discouer the greate tormentes which he had endured for the loue of Floria , then how in fine wt the aide of ye Chabermaides, he made hir drunk, to vse hir company, omitting nothing of al which hath bin mecioned. Wherof the whole company were sore abashed, except Floria , who onely was very well contented and satisfied, for so much as the truth (whiche saued Susanna ) was disclosed, as the concealement therof more than the space of a yeare after the marriage. And imitating this franke confession vttered in presece of irreproueable witnesses, she requyred the aide of the Iustice for the reparation of the wrong and dishonour which she had sustained, so as at hir instant suite, the drunkard and seruants by him nominated, were committed to close prison, assuring you that Ponifre being sober, seeing himselfe so lodged, was more astonied than Floria , when she felte the childe stirre within hir. The nexte morning he was examined of the wordes he had spoken, to see if he wold confesse the truth, but he made himselfe wholye ignorant of the matter, and denied the facte with tooth and naile: excusing hys confession vpon the alienation of hys senses caused by wine, wherevnto there was no more heede to bee taken than to the words of a Foole, from whom a Drunkarde (as wise men saye) differeth in nothing, but that he hath certaine prescribed seasons, which a foole hath not. And what thoughe it were so? (saide hee) the noble minded Pirrhus pardoned those that abused him in speaches saying vnto him: We had hampred thee more hardely, if wine had not bereaued our wittes. And the woman whome Philip of Macedone condemned after dinner, pleadyng hir cause before him fasting, was acquitted of the fact. It were extreame rigor in Iustice to impute anye wordes spoken, or impeache a man of any acte committed in drunkennesse. The whiche being considered by the Iudges, who on the one parte woulde not condemne the bottel to be hanged, and on the other side waying a mischiefe so notorious, put the accused chambermaides to the racke, who being feareful of the horrible torment of the torture, according to the fragilitie of their kind, immediately confessed the truth,  & according to their depositions were brought face to face before the factor, who perceiuing himselfe conuict, required grace of the Iustice, & pardon of his wife. But she was so confirmed in hir vertuous sorrow, as at hir instante supplication; ye chamberers were condemned to be bret aliue, for their liuery of the vngratious wedding, wherof they were the cause (for if the lawes of Germany punishe euery petillasony so rigorously by death, euen for ye smallest domestical pilfery, what torment might suffice a treason so horrible, conspired by those that duty bounde to be moste faithfull? And by the same iudgement was Ponifre , (after hee had assisted this execution with a torch in his hand) broke vpon a wheele  & halfe dead throwne into the same fire. Eue so we see that wine which had bin the occasion of his lasciuious delight, was also the cause of his cruell & infamous death, enforcing him freely to confesse his offence. As whilome it hapned to the emperor Claudius , who in his drunkenesse declared to his wife Agrippina his maliciousnesse so long dissembled. Such were likewise the voluntary instigatios whiche suttle Tyrants gaue in olde time to those whom they wold haue discouered the conspiracies contriued against the: Whervpon proceeded the prouerbe, In vino veritas . And I may tel it you by waye of progression, I beleeue that therevpon is sprong vp ye custome amog the Almaines, that euery one at a banquet is compelled to drinke carouse, to the end the sober may not disclose ye words or deeds of the drunken. Whervnto agreeth ye prouerbe, drinke or be packing: or these words in old time in euery mas mouth, I hate to thinke vpo a drunke mate. Now (honorable company) ye newes of this strange adueture was sodainely blased throughout all Germany . And being come to ye hearing of Charita (who knew right wel what loue had bin betwen hir husbad Herman & Floria , in their youth) sith yt she was now vnmaried, wt ye discouermet of hir good renowne, desired to proue what coutenace Herman wold shew at ye news. Wherfore she caused a bruite to be noised throughout Mens , yt she was deceassed in hir vncles house, in such sorte, as this false report  & notorious punishmet of Ponifre , at one instant wer preseted to ye knowlege of Seigneur Herman , who was assailed with many enimies: for on ye one side ye griefe of his louely Charita drowned hys hart in sorrow, on the other part ye vndeserued infamy which Floria sustained, melted ye same wt tender pitie. Notwithstanding hir seuere Chastitie was not conteted with so ample satisfactio, but for ye loue of hir honor taking vegeace of hir perso, partly by ye death of hir husband, had pursued ye ruine of him which had destroied hir good name, nothing moued to desist therefro by ye memory of ye delightful plesures receiued in hir new mariage. So comendable was hir Uirginitie violate by enforcement, as it coulde not be redeemed againe, but with the price of a sorrowfull widowhoode. Then the iust punishement of so bolde and rare a crime of a prentise and seruant for sacrifice vnto his maistresse so largely offended, reioysed him again so exceedingly, as among so many assaylantes, he knewe not to which to encline and attribute the aduantage, but that sodaine loue depriued his libertie of choice, vsing the aucthoritie of a Lorde towardes his vassall, reuiuyng and kindlyng in hys Liuer (the naturall siege of passioned desires) the auncient flames whiche Tyme had couered for a while, but not altogither mortified. So as he persuaded himselfe, that fortune to salue the wrong she had done vnto him before time, yeelded him nowe fauourable occasion of recompence and reuengement, ordaining hymselfe, and Floria to be widowers both at one time. And in this temper fraughted with all good hope, he departed in poste haste from Antwerpe to Mens , to the ende to winne againe the place whiche before- time he had possessed in his maistresse hearte. And fearing to be preuented by some other, hee shewed euidently by his impatient posting, that Loue (according to the opinio of the wisest greeks) is not pictured with wings, but bycause he giueth (as it seemeth) wings vnto his desirous subiectes. But let vs leaue him in his hasty iourney, and retourne easyly to viewe the demeanour of victorious Floria , whom euerye man thought happy now: so vnconstat are the casualties of this worlde, as we commend the thing to morrow which we blame to day. Now you may behold hir notably reuenged, but hir stomacke was not yet so satisfied, nor hir mind so contented, but needes she must leaue eternal markes of hir integritie vnto hir posteritie. For finding hir solitarinesse single in the house of hir mother (by such meanes as she had deuised) she kindled a fire, ouer whiche she set a greate chaffer full of wine, and whilest it was in heating, after she hadde regarded with bathed eies hir preatie babe, she began to fill the chamber with pitifull complaints, and bitter bewaylings. Then taking ynke and paper, she made hir laste will and testament, whereby after thankes giuing to God for his gratious benefits bestowed vpon hir, she bequeathed hir soule into his hands,  & sacrificed hir body for the ransome of hir renown, recommending hir son the witnesse of hir crime vnto hir mother. Then turning hir face towardes ye fire, she behelde the wine which boyled amaine. Wherfore she closed the paper, the summe wherof was signed with hir name, and with a dying hand she hid it in the childs bosome, in kissing wherof a thousand times, she bedeawed the face with warme teares: and rising from it, she saide: See, see, my soule, the houre wherin thou shalt take vengeance of this wicked body, giuing certaine testimony, that therwith my chaste minde hath not bin violated, but hath preserued it selfe pure and vndefiled, euen to the ende. But thou (vile carcasse) bycause thou haste bin such a traitour vnto thy Lord, thou shalt die, & shalt receiue thy death by the selfe same thing, wherby thou haste offended. Then with an enraged constantnesse almost mad, shee tooke the vessell of boyling wine & drunke it vp to the last drop, without anye mouing at the extreame paine vntil hir entrailes, euen parched by this vnmeasurable heate, shronke togither and braste with such violence, as of necessitie death approched, to set an vnion amog them, chacing the beautifull soule out of the painefull body to direct it into glorie and eternall felicitie. Oh straunge and vnreported punishment, euen as rare as the vertue of this Gentlewoman. Where shalte thou finde the like? for that of the Prince, who for payment of hys ambition was drowned in a Butte of Malmsey is farre different, yet here are two straunge deathes, the one of Audebunt King of Britaine, who caught hys bane by drinking too muche, the other of Maister Ophil Basteleur , who surfetted of drinking too hot. This strange death was not long concealed, the famous reporte whereof engendred greate copassion in euery mans harte, who ran from al quarters to behold it, aswell for the rarenesse of the facte, as to celebrate the laste honoures vnto thys vnvanquished chastitie. In fauoure whereof, al the townish Dames apparelled like Mourners both in bodye and minde, wyth greate pompe conducted the corpes (whilome the vessell of al perfections) vnto hir sepulchre: whervppon for a perpetuall memorie of a facte so couragious was erected at the townes charges a sumptuous  & stately Tombe. O happy monument, the Christall skies mollifie thy grauestone with the deawe of Manna , and make the odiferous roses and violets continually spryng about thee, as a crown vnto the beautie which is lodged within thee, and lette the Bees and gallant Butterflies make their perpetuall abode therein to accompany the graces whiche inhabite in thee. But lette thornes and thistles wither, rather than take roote neare thee, and lette all venemous and filthy wormes feare to approch the entrance of this holy Temple of Chastitie, sithence thys beautifull dame hated vice so hartily. The bruite of this piteous death (courteous company) fleeing into euery coaste, stayed not vntill it sounded in the eares of Herman , who was nowe within halfe a dayes iourney of Mens , making full accompte at his returne to finde the worthy recompence of his trauailes. When he was assured by one that mette hym on the way, of the famous death and buriall of hir, for whome heretofore hee liued: at these wofull newes, the miserable louer fell from his horse in a sowne vnto the greate amazement of euery one, who after they had chaffed his temples with vineger, throwne colde water in his face, clapped hym aboute the cheekes, wrong hys little finger, and ministred all the remedies they coulde imagine, in fine they perceyued their labour loste. The cause wherof, was a sodaine alteration out of exceeding ioye into extreame sorrowe, the which by the opinion of the Phisitions therevnto called, engendred a mortall convulsion, caused by the restraint and suppression of the ventricle of the braine, whereby the way was stopped vnto al the vitall spirites, enforcing them to bee sequestred fro ye body. Ah infortunate louer, oughtest thou to haue made such hast, as by thy disordinate haste to hasten thy death? Ah (saide graue Dionisius ) howe happy is he, that in his youth learneth to be vnhappy? The Bull (saide he) tollerateth his yoke more easyly that is broken therto in due season. The wise Greeke spake very prudently, saying: The gretest misery yt may be, is disabilitie to suffer misery patiently. Alas how extreame griefe deliuereth feruent loue by ye losse of ye thing beloued, sithence pearcing sorrow could giue his passioned hart no leisure to receiue cofort by any means. For as ye Phisition doth loth to receiue any drug to cure him in sickenes, except ye same bee vrged vpo him by another: so selfe coforte in sorrow is a very difficult matter without ye consolation of some friend. The which Phalerius confessed he had experimeted, by ye moste soueraine remedy in distresse, after he met with Crates , whe he was miserably banished out of his realme. The teares of the funeralls of Floria remained yet vpon ye peoples cheekes of Mens , when ye seruant of Herman arriued with news of the lamentable death of his maister. Whose determinations he declared, being a faithfull secretarie of his loue, whereat euery man meruailing, could not coniecture otherwise, but that death was become aduersary to loue,  & yt in despight & enmitie of it, was desirous to destroy ye moste affectioned subiects of Cupid , for the performace whereof it had begon with Herman & Floria , determining to finish the exploite with Charita , who remained. Charita I mean, who as I tolde you, by curiositie or rather ielousie, gaue out notice of hir death, to view if ye old loue of hir husbad had any strength to reuiue. And now behold, it reuiued after ye decease of Herman , whiche she testified not by rashe deathe, esteeming hir sorrow ouer great to take so short end, but to make it endure as long as it was possible. And althogh there appeared an euidet folly on the behalfe of hir husband, who like one touched wt Circes rod, or as he had eaten some enchaunted herbe, was so soone transformed fro a loyall husband into a wauering louer: Neuerthelesse, the whole blame was laide in hir necke, as hauing opened ye gate to this mischiefe, for the which she performed perpetuall penace, neuer entending to marry again: esteeming the (as Chilon saith) very foolish, yt beeing by paineful swimming preserued fro shipwracke, wil any more adueture their liues vnto the mercy of ye sea. Nowe she lefte none other guage of Hermans loue, but a daughter, who by ye ordinace of ye blessed fates, was after many trauailes wedded to ye son of Floria , the history of whom pertaineth nothing to our purpose, but to declare, yt in fine (maugre ye enuy of fortune or me) by diuine permission they matched togither, and vnited the two famous families of Herman and Floria . Thus by this true Hystorie, you may clearly perceiue that all disasters which chaunce in Loue, do euermore proceede by the mans default: for I pray you, what more loyall and sincere Loue may be desired in any, than was apparant in these twoo vertuous dames, testified by so outward tokens, as they seemed to contend who best deserued the highest seate among suche as loue most faithfully. For Floria would not liue after the losse of hir Chastitie, (the treasure of all hir wealth and felicitie) and so muche esteemed hir honor, as for the loue thereof, shee pardoned not hir husbande, whom she loued right well, and of whome shee was well entreated, wherein she far surmounted the commendation of hir, that with poyson drunke betwene hir and hir louer Sinoryx by equal moities, cried quittance for hir husbands death,  & hir own defamation: Or of hir, who subtilly tumbling the souldior into a well, reuenged the violation of hir honour. To be briefe, she exceeded the constancie of the Romaine dame, who eating burning coales pursued by extreame loue hir deade husband. And Charita by a perpetuall widdowhoode solemnized the sorrowe of hir goodman, yeelding hir consent to liue the widowe of all delight. Wherin she agreed very well with the vertuous zeale of beautifull Valeria , who affirmed, that hir husbad was dead vnto others, but liued eternally vnto hir, and that she caried him more effectually in hir harte, than the Queene Artemisia , who drinking the ashes of hir husbande, edified a pretious tombe for him in hir breaste. Thus me thinketh that those which marry the second time, attribute no great honour vnto their first husbads, with whom it seemeth they bury their loue, wherein the Turtle that neuer maketh but one choice, oughte greately to shame them. Whervpon the Prouerbe saith, the firste marriages are made in Heauen, and the seconde in Hell, so as, if they proue good  & lucky, ye deuill is much deceiued: wherfore Rodopa daughter vnto ye mighty K. of Arsa iustly slewe hir Nourse, bicause she perswaded hir to marry againe, for the agreementes of second marriages, are more difficill to encounter, tha it is vneasie to match a nutte shel with any other, than that fro which it was first seuered. I speake thus bycause this vulgare comparison seemeth more familiar than the auncient philosophie of Plato . But to proceede, sithence the singular vertue of women so euidently appeareth in these two Dames, beholde I beseeche you, on the contrarye part, the malice of men practised so nimbly by Ponifre and Herman . Whervnto Sir Fleur d'Amour exclaming in gracious maner, sayd, Be not displeased gentle woman, although I interrupt you, for it maye suffise you that I haue paciently harkened vnto the commendation of wome, without burdening me with the peysant pack of mens infamie, which you meane to bring in question, nothing to the purpose, for so muche as Ponifre in mine opinion deserued no reproche, hauing played but the good fellows part in seeking his good fortune: yea, and I commend him in folowing his businesse effectually, whereas on the contrarie part I cannot excuse Floria , bicause she wanne nought by his death, considering by marying hir he had amended and repayred his offence: but therin she shewed the extreme desire of vengeaunce, which naturally is common to women, as the Poet testifieth, saying: The wild Bore pursued by doggs, the sterueling Lionesse, the Tigre that hath hir whelpes stollen, nor the Uiper when his tayle is troden vpon, are not more terrible than a woman offended. And as for Herman , what could he doo lesse, hauing lost his wife as he supposed, than in good season to seeke another, and not like a childe to cry for an apple, as though there were no moe in the world? As for me, I thinke it great simplicitie to remayne long a widower, except a man will marry no more: for surely the dead pretende great interest, and are very carefull if the liuing marry, or no. Truely (answered Mistresse Mary ) you haue reason. But I pray you ought he not to haue taried the ende of the yere, which our forefathers tearmed, the yere of sorrowe? It must not be sayd that onely women are accepted in the lawes, to the ende that if they married againe so quickly, and chaunced to be sodenly with childe, the infant should be supposed to haue an vncertayne father. But the sacred lawes established for the perfection of good ordinaunces, haue notified the yere of sorowe for a publike honestie, which toucheth aswell men as women. Against the which Herman hath notoriously offended, deliuering a seconde testimonie of his legeritie and inconstancie. For first beeing weery of too great ease, he would needes go see the Mart at Antwerpe, where in fine, he turned his loue backwarde, and had better to haue beleeued his wife: yet to shewe you that I speak without affection, and as the truth leadeth me, I wil giue halfe an ounce of blame vnto Charita , in that she was inquisitiue to know if hir husband were amorous. And this curiositie hath deceyued many, who in the end haue found ye thing they sought, wherof the lamentable loue of Cephalus and Procris is sufficient testimonie. But what? as there is no Saint in Paradise but hath his feast, so is there no creature liuing but hath some fault. And in truth women are to be detected of no imperfection, iealousie onely excepted, which foloweth them like their shadows. Thus spake the gallant king Alphonsus , It were a goodly matter in mariage, if the husband were deafe, and the wife blinde. Wherein he hath in my fantasie excused women, to blame men: for why wished he they shoulde be blinde, but onely for feare they should see the crymes of their husbandes. And I leaue to your iudgement, whether they are more to be blamed that do the offence, or those that view the fact to reproue it. So as when all is sayd, sithence iealousie proceedeth but of too feruent loue, it is necessary that women be iealous, bicause they loue more truly than men. But touching the excuse, whereby you surmise to couer the fault of Ponifre , as with a wet poke, I had willingly pardoned him, if he had made choyse of his equall, and obtayned hir by lawfull meanes: but to shoote without the leuell of his bow, was great temeritie. For although men say it is no vice to loue the best, yet me thinketh, imitating the aduice of Dianira in Ouid , that to drawe a Cart currantly, it behoueth to payre the Oxen as equally in bignesse, height, and strength, as maye be deuised, to the ende they maye take their labour alike: Euen so, in mariage most perfect equalitie is requisite, and as intier vnanimitie as is possible: otherwise the one serueth but as a thorne in the others foote, to hinder their forwardnesse. And that whiche you attribute for constancie in Ponifre , I repute it an importunitie too intollerable. Wherevnto replied Sir Fleur d'Amour , I pray you Mistresse, let the commendation which you would acquire vnto women, proceede of their demerits, and not be augmented by the blame of men. For if we woulde vse reuenge, you should be sore troubled to recite vnto vs the actes which make you women so vertuous. For so muche as sith the one slewe hir selfe, and the other not, it ensueth there was a fault in the one and the other. And although the Historians affirme, that Sardanapalus neuer dyd any vertuous deede vntill he slewe him selfe, bicause suche actes require great outrage: so it is that the very Pagane lawes haue allowed suche death, principallye when it commeth by the scruple of conscience, which fraughteth the Malefactour with infinite furies, as we reade of Orestes : or for feare to fall into the enemies hands, as Haniball dyd: or to eschewe infamie, as it chaunced vnto the Poet Gallus : or for the healing of a remedilesse greefe, as Portius Latro , to cure a quartayne feuer: or by the impaciencie of loue, as it befell to Pyramus and Thisbe : or for despight of beeing preuented of an intended purpose, as Mereta , seeing hir Louer married to an other Mayden: or for any other displeasure whatsoeuer. True it is, the Paganisme also pardoned those that slewe them selues for anye allowable cause, as for the sauegarde of their virginitie, lyke Dido, Sophronia , and Democles : or to knowe what men dyd in the other worlde, lyke Cleombrot and the Millefians : or to benefite the common wealth by their death, as the Knighte Martius , and the Emperour Othon dyd: or for feare to hurte them selues, as Themistocles was constrayned to doo: or for weerinesse of lothed life, like Pompeius Atticus . To conclude, worthy Plinie affirmed, that the greatest benefite whiche nature hath bestowed vpon man, is to dye when he pleaseth, the which neuerthelesse, is farre from the good opinion of Plato , who denieth that a matter of so great importance ought to be in mans power: but that whosoeuer killeth himselfe, is punishable as a souldier that departeth without his captaines pasport: or as the prisoner that breaketh the gayle to escape, which maketh much agaynst your Floria , and yet we woulde not haue gainsayde you, although we perfectly perceyue, that to excuse hir you haue charged Ponifre with making hir drunken. So as if this were probable, I affirme that thervpon could hardly ensue any rauishmet of virginitie, and least of all, any conception: for I suppose no drunken woman can conceyue. So as when you touched this point, you passed ouer it lightlye without satisfying me fully therein. I haue (sayd Mistresse Mary ) done it, partly bicause I would not abuse your fauourable audience with the tediousnesse of my discourse: and also to auoyde the displeasure wherwith an acte so enorme maye molest your mindes, without calling in question an argument which I knowe hath bene very doubtfully disputed by those that haue exactly ransacked the secrete lawes of Nature: besides that, it appertayneth not vnto me to enter into subtill and deepe considerations. But lest my Historie shoulde rest maymed in this behalfe, sithence it is your pleasures, I will speake thereof as a student of warre, and will tell you what I thinke, vnder correction neuerthelesse of your better iudgement, wherevnto my simple opinion shall appeale. I knowe for truth, that euery man iudgeth wine moderately taken to be a great pricke vnto pleasure, imitating the auncient Romaine Prouerbe, Sine Baccho & Cerere friget Venus . Whiche was the occasion that Anacharsis beeing checked bicause he had maried a foule woman, sayd, Fill me wine, that she may seeme beautifull vnto me. But if wine be vnmeasurably poured in, it maketh the body lasie, dull, benumined, pensiue, and witlesse to loue, drowning the stomacke in rawe humours, wherof ensueth debilitie of the brayne, trembling of the sinewes, and dissipation of the senses, whiche are all contrarie motions vnto generation, which requireth great temperature and harmony of humours: so as we may say with Pithagoras , that the Uine beareth three grapes, whereof the first altereth, the seconde troubleth; and the thirde intierly dulleth, which causeth great drunkards to be commonly no great lechers. And drunkennesse accustomably accompanieth age, but lecherie leaueth a man when youth falleth, the which I confesse frely, but I agree not that drunkennesse yeldeth in al persons disabilitie of generation, for reason and examples make me to credite the contrary. And yet I admit not the distinction which some make of the agent and the patient, saying that a drunken man cannot engender, although the woman be sober, but the cotrary may be very well, bycause the dominant in generation which gyueth the essentiall forme, being euil disposed, doeth adnihilate altogether. Whiche is contrarye to the Histories, that make mention that the daughter of Siracusus named Ciana , and a Romain Dame named Medulilla , were gotten with child by their drunken fathers: but I will defende (as an impregnable bulwarke for the resolution of this point) that when there is but the one or the other drunken, there may ensue generation, the which notwithstanding is imperfect, bycause the defecte maye be somewhat amended but not clearely abrogated: Which is the cause, that the children so created are weake, vnhealthy,  & slender witted, as witnesseth Diogenes, who seeing a very dotish child, called him the sonne of a drunkarde. But if the man and woman be both drunken, I am persuaded there can not possibly insue any generatio, for the peruersnesse of the qualities, the intemperancie of humours, the dissipation of the vitall spirites, the imbecillitie of the appetent habitude which worketh by the imaginitiue. And by the same reason we may conclude, that two cholericke or melancholy persons, in extremytie are vnprofitable togither, omitting the most vrgent arguments tending towards generation, and the causes therof, bycause they are better seeming in the eare than in ye mouth of a maiden. So as that whiche I haue touched, sufficeth (as I coniecture) to shewe it not to be impertinent, that Floria conceiued being drunk, hir husband being otherwise. For my part saide Sir Bel Acueil , I thinke that sithence generation is made by the force of a liuely apprehension, wherof ensueth an intention of seede in a receptacle wel disposed, that if the woman taketh no pleasure (as she doth not) being drunk, she shal neuer conceiue, what good temperature and consistance soeuer be in the seede, neyther shal any woman with child euer make mee belieue that shee was rauished: for thoughe it bee no midwiues rule, yet is it very true, that the woman whiche is gotte with child by night, shal be deliuered with delight. Sauing your reuerence, sayde mistresse Margarite , if yt were true a great absurditie would arise therby: for you wil easily confesse that the pleasure of men differ from the maner of beastes for so muche as men by the benefite of the exteriour senses, make discret election of the beautye whereof loue is ingendered, the which is the only cause of coniunction whervppon cometh generation. Wherfore we must conclude yt they ingeder not that ioyne not, they ioyne not that loue not, they loue not that view not some beauty worthy to bee beloued. Then by this reconing the blinde aswel men as women shal neuer haue children, seeing nothing that may procure them to doe. Furthermore it wold insue yt where most pleasure were, there should be generation soonest, and yet we see some can haue no children the first and second yeare after they be maried, yea  & long time after, who at last, euen in their age haue many. As we reade of Massinissa , and Cato the Censor . Wherefore your reasons cannot hinder but it must needes appeare clearely by the truth of this historie, that the bounty of women surmounteth the malice of men. Now I pray you what a matter had it bin if these two dames had foud husbads according to their merits and of like Uertue (at least if any such might be foud) but rather tel me, replied sir de Firmefoy , how happy had these two yong men bene, whom their cruel wiues exceeding loue caused to dye, as they did, who desired to doe some good in their life time, or such as haue bin so wise as to do ye like, haue experimented to their cost, how great disturbers women bee of vertuous actions, be it in war as Darius and Metridates do testify, or in Philosophy as Socrates complained him, whiche maketh me to belieue, that if men woulde neuer marrie, they could not fayle to attain great felicitie: This is ye cause wherfore men say comonly when talke is had of a yong mans mariage, (he must be staied) for in deede I belieue we shoulde flie into heauen, if this stay with held vs not. I am content to cal a woman a stay, although I knowe many haue bin constrained to speake more hardly calling hir our peasant crosse, as he witnesseth, who hearing ye preacher say it behoued that euery man should carry his owne crosse, ran immediately home and take up his wife vpon his backe,  & brought hir into ye church: God or the Deuill deliuer me of some of my crosse, or else hyr weight will breake my necke. In conclusion, the wome which caused the death and destruction of Ponifre & Herman , putteth me in memorie of the answere of a husbandman vnto his gossip. Which is in ryme thus. Not long agon an honest countrey man, Mynding to match his sonne vnto a maide, Asked his friend some friendly counsel than, In answere wherof to him his neighbour saide: Your childe is to yong, and hath yet simple wit, What said the sire, if al the world were sage Wedding would seeme a dogge so farre vnfit, That worldings would crie fye on mariage. Whervnto Mistresse Marie answered laughing, you alledge very rustical testimonies vnto vs, of people that neither know honestie nor honor. No, no, (replied the gentleman again) stay not for so small a matter to confesse ye truth, for the better sorts are worse, if al were knowen, as witnesseth thys whiche was spoken this other day to a stately Sire. Why vauntest thou in braue aray, Therby thine honor to support? Thy wife, the vulgare people say, Is counted of the common sort. Upon these differences the Lady taking ech one by the had toke up the matter till the next morning, & in choller they wet merily to Supper, wher we wil leaue them giuyng them good night. The end of the second dayes pastime. repented him, thoughte it the greatest to passe any day without ye erudition of something, according to the examples of the most excellet painters, who suffered no day to escape without the drawing of some line at the least, wherby they scourged idlenesse as with a whippe: And if famous Solon whiche by a continuall care to learne, rewarded or rather reuenged him of his agednesse had viewed the gentle schole of our gentlemen and gentlewomen, I know not with what commendation they had exalted the couetous botie of learning wherwith these gallats enuiously studied to make their quotidianly pastimes, wherein aught to be marked I know not what vertuous contention, accompanied with dayly perseuerance, the honest commendation wherof put such a flie in the eare of euery partie, as they had no leysure to sleepe, so liuely was the pricke which solicited their thoughts, approching their nexte awake to search diligently the meane to be reuenged the one of the other, and to procede from weldoing vnto better. So that if any frowning browe, termeth this exercise friuolous  & unseemly for a grave witte, the goode chauncellor of Athens wil condemne his foolish presumption, who hauing heard hys nephew recite a Saphicke sonet at a banquet, intreated the chylde to teach him the same, and being demaunded whereof thys desire proceded, considering his age and authoritie, he answered, to the ende that I maye die, esteeming nothing more vnworthy in a noble personage than ignorance: Ignoraunce I say, which he blamed more than the desire to knowe things, whych they repute, chyldish & vnconuenient (in their conceites) that so styffely stande vpon the prick of their reputations. Furthermore, ye wysest amog al the sapients, blushed not to acquainte him with children that played on the harpe, and to learne of them, although he were aged: esteeming ignorant auntientnesse more odious, than the apprentisage of any thing what soeuer. Finally, this sapient sayd, yt men maintayned the ignorance of beasts, but the desire of knowledge intended a certaine deuinitye. Let vs then haue a longing to learne, yea euen when our owne foote shall stande vppon the graues brincke, after the example of the prudent Romaine Councellour: And let vs not disdaine to learne trifling toyes, But let vs haste to viewe what our gallant youth will saye, who being wearied with their euening gamsomnesse, hadde gladly taken the mornings nap but for a Hunt is vppe, alias , good morrow, giue the by a copany of country clownes, which came vnto the castel very earely in the morning, to surrender their accustomed honor vsed yearely vnto the Ladye and mistresse, laden with greene boughes and birdes in their nestes, strewyng hearbes, honye combes, fresh cheeses of al fashions, wyth great pompe and rural magnifycence, making the aire to ring with the melodie of their pipes, tabors, kits and bagpipes, besides morrise daunces, and hobby horses were plety, In this sort to see the pyping  & dauncing, a man would haue taken them for little angels issuing out of some country paradice. At thys ioyful alarme the gentlemen all sleepie forsooke their beds, wythout regard of the rules of Phisicke, whych affirme that to arise so sodaynly engendereth greate euyls, and hurteth them that desire to haue a smoth skynne and delicate colour. Then halfe ready and half awaked they came downe into the court to behold the braue countrey boyes, whom they forced to daunce after the sound of the instruments, vntil being weary of playing, they fell to singing diuerse brawles of Poitou , as pleasant to heare as I feare they would be irksome to reade, principallye to those that neuer knew Talebot and Robines : whych shall cause me to alter the delightfulnesse of the language into more intelligible tearmes, yet obseruing the same number and measure of feete: For the gentlman hauing a while relied after the clownish custome (whiche they call commonly countrey like) they entreated the damosels to take their partes: The which hauing augmented the carroll round, bega to recite many brawles about the nosegay, wherof I wil report such as I haue best remembred. ech bloming braunch doth sprout their tender buds VVhen whithered leaues fro okes are ouerthrowen, the liuely greene doth clad the ragged woods, And old Saturnus with his hoary face, at Phebus sight resignes his frosen place. Then doth the sappe ascende from euery roote, and spreadeth through the twigs of euery tree, Dame Nature shewes hir force from head to foote and yeeldes hir treasures most indifferently. The fruitful Vine to spring she doth prouoke, which doth, in ayde, imbrace the sturdy oke. The siluer streames resounde, the pleasant plantes of euery bird that pypes a doleful laie, The floures sweete with gallant coules paintes, the meadowes greene and euery wilsome way, The Nightingale, the Robin, and the thrush, recordes their notes from euery bush to bush. The turtle true, laments hir louer lost, ech foule and beast, doth chose a louing make, And as they like, they liue with slender cost, and whilest they breed al change they quite forsake: Their stedfast staye, and wandring mindes may moue, what loyal heartes we ought to beare in loue. My Lady faire, sith in the pleasant spring, dame Natures nimphes, do florish blome and beare: Sith byrde and beast, and euery liuing thing, embraceth loue by kinde, exempt of feare, VVhy should you lodge colde winter in your breaste, to quench the flame that breedeth men vnrest? Display before Sir Phebus melting beames the curtaine of your cruel frosen hart, Droppe down some deawe to comfort mine extremes, let not my death bewraie mine inward smart: So may Cupido qualyfye your rage. and you in time my burning heate asswage. Thus must I liue in hope of my desire, graunt grace or else pronounce my fatal dome, Your nay shal heape but coales vppon my fire, say yea, then is my wished houre come, Twixt yea and nay if you indifferent stande, my weary life and death is in your hand. VVil you or not, your seruant I remaine, relieue me, else release me of my paine. when cursed Cupid list to frowne. And yet he will not credite truth, til hard mishap doth throw him downe, He hath the power in his distresse. to see what may his smart redresse. Must hoarie heares needes make vs wise dicouering naked treasons hooke? VVhose glittering hue by sleight deuise doth make them blind that theron loke, And til into the trappe they slide, belieue that reason is their guide. If liuing wightes might plainely see, the suttelties of womens wittes, That couered in their bosomes lye hid and disclosde by wily fittes, Then would they shunne the glaring eye, whose burning beames doth cause the dye. VVhere suters serue with long delay, in dayly hope of some good happe, Tormenting griefes at length doe pay their hiers, with an afterclappe, For such rewardes they dayly finde, that beate a stedfast loyal minde. Behold the guerdon due to loue bestowed on a fickle femme, As good of rotten wood to proue the forging of some pretious gemme. Repentaunce last doth pinch the hart, that loue consumes with bitter smart. Youth bends the net to catch the pray, which some inioy that takes no paine, He toyles, yet seeth euery day his labour wasted al in vaine: He beates the bush, by sugred wordes but other steale away the burdes. Thus to the fine of Louers gaine, is lothsome trauaile for their paine. the blinded god of Loue. VVhere euery God and goddesse sat, did plant his throne aboue. The same vnto all mortall wights with spite did purchase woe, And gaue the place of all delights, vnto our mortall foe. VVho traytour-like with friendly shewe, entraps the warelesse wight, Discharging from his poysned bowe his venomous dart so right, As where it hits, the hart doth wast in flames of quenchlesse fire: First kindled by the gleamings cast from eyes we most desire. Sith then we beare of cruell loue the arrowe and the wounde, VVhich aye renewing he doth proue our senses to confounde: No oyntment, pultesse, salue, ne braunche, can cure the festred sore, Our pinching pangs doo neuer staunche, but grypeth more and more. No pleasaunt flowred medowe gay, nor winding riuers shore, Nor wildsome wood or deserts, may the pining heart restore: From Venus bondage nothing can a greeued mynde set free, To ayde the poore distressed man, no meane but death we see. If we will sayle vpon the seas, Cupido keepes the poupe, And if we hap to ride for ease, he sitteth on the croupe. VVhere so the wofull Louer is, euen there also is he, In bedde the wrangler will not misse his pillowbeare to be. Eche sicknesse or contagious greefe his contrarie doth cure, The Antidote doth yeelde releefe to poysoned creatures sure. Thus eche thing hath a salue to heale their torments and their smartes, VVhen louers must to death appeale, to ease their woful heartes. The Queene of Candies raging lust, at pleasure long possest, And shamefull vse with sire vniust, of Myrrha hir incest: The sister burning in the loue of brother most vnkinde, By the deceitefull brat aboue, release of care dyd finde. But suche as loue in loyall sort, and hope reliefe to finde, VVith them the elfe doth make his sport, he smiles to see them pinde: He seekes to reaue them of delight, and breedes them all annoy, It is of all the most despight to trust the lying boy. Make loue who list an angell then, who list may like his wayes, For neyther I, my toung, or pen, will euer yeelde him prayse: And who so doth, shal liue at ease, deuoyde of care and strife, Vnlesse that libertie displease to leade a quiet life. This Loue whom Poets call a God, is but a fury fell, Sent from aboue, a scourging rod, out of the pitte of hell, To martyre and to put to payne all poore afflicted wights, But wise are they that can refrayne this Helhoundes hellishe frights. Then beeing weerie of dauncing roundes, they beganne a Galliarde, singing: deserues the faithlesse wight, Sith that the faythfull louers life doth tast eche worldly spight? An hundred times a day I craue, my heart with sorrowes fraught, VVere ground to dust, or in my graue by wormes consumde to naught. But as the Salamander ioyes amid the burning fire, So doth my heart byde all annoys, in flames of my desires. The winde and rayne which from my soule by teares and sighes do flye, At once doth light and dead the cole, which makes me liue and dye. I would not shewe my miserie, which I can not conceale, Lest I should force hir cruelly to scorne the woe I feele. At least if any recompence dyd flowe in liew of payne, I would support with patience my woe in hope of gayne. But suffer while that life doth last, and let all torments tosse, VVho so his weerie dayes hath past, may winde vp with the losse. Oh if the goddes had euer will to wreake a Louers wrong, Graunt that she may be sterued still, and kept in bondage strong, By loue of some that in despight will scorne hir loyall hart, That she may taste the small delight I haue possest in smart. And sith she will not when she may for loue yeelde loue agayne, That when she will she may haue nay, and louelesse aye remayne. Afterwards the Gentlewomen began to sing many ditties: but I feare to annoy the reader by too diligent collection of the Sonets, wherin this braue company tooke their disportes with so great affection, as the morning slid away with a trice, more swiftly than the flight of a swalow. So as eche one astonied, gased one vppon the other, when worde was brought them that dinner attended their comming, whervnto they hasted, drying their brows bedewed with sweat: which was the cause that beeing all set at the table, the Lady, by maner of deuice propouded vnto them a question concerning daunces, if they ought to be called good, euill, or indifferent. And this cause found aduocates on either part, so affectioned to ye matter, as neither allegation, reason, authority, example, nor historie, as wel in sacred writ, as prophane, escaped them, which was not published apparantly. But bicause it is a disputation nothing perteining to our intended purpose, I wil silently passe it ouer, especially bicause it is at this day sufficiently debated vpon. And I beleeue if the exposition of Poisse had not bin stayed vpon this difficultie, it had not bin remitted vnto the Councell and Sinode of our Genterie, who hauing sounded the depth of most subtill Theologie, ayded with the commodities of Phisicke, ceassed this processe, in fine vnto the contentment of all parties, which very fewe Iudges can doo. Nowe the banquet and disputation beeing ended, they desired to walke into the Parke, where they entred into goodly allies among the thicke hautie Wooddes, kepte of purpose to defende the sunne. There was a poole of liuely water, maruellous pleasaunte and delectable, whiche serued to bathe men in the moste ardent heate of Sommer, but principallye to water beastes, and the streame thereof braue a Mill, whiche did grinde al maner of graine for the prouision of the Castell. All the company being arriued at the place where the heade of thys Poole did spring, they founde a Turret, whiche was the Fishermans lodging, in the toppe whereof was in forme of a Medall, the portraiture of a Nunne holding a Lanterne, and seemed as thoughe she would throwe hirselfe headlong downe into the Poole. At the foote of this Tower was the Image of a ma stretched along vpo the grauel, disgorging out of his mouth a greate brooke, whereof proceeded thys Poole: neare vnto him was a Tombe, which serued for a storehouse or coffer to locke in the the nettes, hookes, leades, lines, and other instruments of fishing, and also toyles, grinnes, panters, pursenets, and other tooles pertaining to hunting and fouling. Nowe vppon this Tombe was portrayd the figure of a Satyre and a Nimph standing right vp with sorrowfull semblant and crossed armes, holding therein Tables grauen after the olde fashion: and in the Satyres Table was written. Conceiued sith Dame Venus was Vpon the fome of surging Seas, No Swimmer may this water passe, Hir wrathfull spite doth so displease: Leander knewe too soone alas, VVhen feruent Loue did force him seaze The deadely shoare where Hero laye, For salte Seas drownde hym by the waye. Here loyall Loue with beauty knit Doth make their dayly residence, And as to Louers seemeth fit, hath here moste perfecte aliaunce: But cruell death alas did meete this Ladye for hir recompence, VVhen with hir eye she did beholde hir louer dead on grauell colde. After they had a little time staied, musing to cosider this mute tragedy, Uery wel said Sire Fleur d'Amour , Do we not see which way soeuer we looke, yt my first proposition is true,  & that al ye euill of Loue, notwithstadyng ye successiue actes of Fortune, proceedeth alwaies of ye womas part? And if these Images of stone could speake, they wold quickly ease me of ye paine I vndertake to report ye same vnto you, neuerthelesse they witnes it sufficietly to such as wil vnderstand it, disciphering vnto vs the piteous history of the .2. miserable louers, Leander and Hero , whose loues wer happily begon  & prudently conducted, if ye impatient desires of Hero had not put ye too obedient louer to death, causing him to enterprise more tha humain force could tollerate, giuing hym mortall adiornment, or ineuitable danger by ye light of hir lantern, for it was by night, when he failed not to make his deadly apparance: so gret fealtie resteth in a louer, as no peril can hinder his duty, louing rather to die in obeying, tha to liue in suspicion of disloyaltie. And ye waters which executed the wil of their customarie neighbor, (for ye tower of Hero stoode vpon the Sea shoare) were pitiful toward ye breathlesse body, guiding it to reder a good accopt vnto his loue of his durable faith vnto ye ende. Be not displeased sir, answered maistresse Margarite , you coster ye matter to your most aduantage: for whatsoeuer ye trim maister of Loue saith, sithece for want of proofes we must haue recourse vnto coniectures, I say it is easie to presume yt ye vncircuspect desire, which ordinarily ruleth their voluble louers, had so greatly encroched vpo this poore Getlema, as blinding his eies wt a violent passion, he rashly threw his body headlong vnto the mercy of ye mouting waues, wherby he receiued ye reward of his folly. For to say yt the gentlewoman conseted thervnto throgh defect of amitie, what reason wer it, sithece she testified the cotrary by hir death, amending  & punishing in hir proper perso ye error of hir husbad? wherin she hath very wel shewed yt hir affectio much surmounted the goodwil of Leander , for he died throgh his folly,  & she for his loue. Leander died casually vnwitting therof: she wt resolution  & immutable deliberation. And if ye folly of Leander be not excused being attributed vnto the force of Loue, yet had he recopece of his harmes by ye plaintes  & sorrow of his Loue, but she had no friend, who closing hir eies once prayed yt the waighty earth might lighte vppon hir bones, that hir soule might wander among the delicious forrests, wher they go yt in their life time loued faithfully. For althogh I iudge ye sorrow & pitie of a woman too dearely bought when it costeth hir life, & thinke it meere folly for a man to breake hys necke wilfullye, surmising happily to please his maistresse therby: So it is, neuerthelesse, that the soules of those that are dead for the loue of their Maistresse, are wel comforted when they vnderstande the sorrow which they demean for their absence? Wherevnto Sire Bel Acoeuil laughing, replied: What Antosysme hathe reuealed vnto you this Mythologie, discouering vnto you what men do after they be dead? Truely Maistresse I agree very well with you, and haue neuer beleeued, but Hero was euer so greedy of hir louers embracings, as she continuallye solicited him to hazarde his life vnto peril, whatsoeuer the Poets saye, who haue a bull of dispensation to lye, the better to sauce their fictions. They to salue the temeritie of these louers, affyrme, that whe Hero swam through ye strayts of Bosphora vpon ye sheeps backe wt ye golde fleece, ye Tritos  & Sea gods esprised of hir loue, watched hir, and tooke hir in the passage. Wherwith the Nimphs were very angry, for it was a great deminishing of their husbandes loue toward the: & to be reuenged, they espied a time whe their goodmen were gone to water the Dolphines whiche drewe the Chariots of the king of ye Waters: euen the came they vnto the purchase of Loue, wher it chauced yt hauing encoutred ye swimmer Leander , they embraced him so strictly, as neuer after they could depart fro him, but lead him to ye Mansion, wheras one of their husbands a fat foole finding him, for ielousie slewe him, as Polyphemus murthered ye louer of his beautiful Galatea . But the pitifull Nimphs vnable to do any more for the colde corpse, rendred it vnto hir whose soule loued it so entirely. And to resolue ye generall questio so learnedly debated by my cousin Sire Fleur d'Amour and Mistresse Mary , notwithstanding the great reasons whiche haue bin openly alleadged hitherto, I cannot impute the changeable fortunes happening in louing, neither to ye Loue, nor to the Louer: for I beleeue they enforce ye fantasies to obtaine ech other in sinceritie of affectio: but their good intents are enuied so by Fortune (who hath no greater pastime, tha to marre ye thing which is wel made) yt it is very vneasy to preserue the fro being surmouted wt mishap, which chaunceth exteriorly, neither ye one nor ye other giuing any entrace thervnto by their own default. And there is no doubt, but as flies gather alwaies to sugre  & other sweet things, eue wt a licorousnesse so importune & obstinate as althogh they be ofte chaced away, yet they return continually: eue so misfortune euermore espieth such liues, whervnto the heaues promise most felicitie, to ye end to make the buy dearely ye delights which they promise theselues, imitating ye Miconies, who (like dogs at weddings) make alwaies repaire wher they are not inuited, wherfore the mishap wherof both ye Loue & Louer reproue ech other, must be attributed vnto ye malice of seuerall accidets, as it wer easie to shew, & so we might be al agreed. That is wel said, answered ye Lady, heale you the forked stroks which these two quarrelers haue giuen ech other, by some example, yt may confirme your fauorable talke. Then she kissed ye historicall nosegay, & preseted it vnto him, which he receiued after certain modest excuses vpo ye sleder abilitie he had to acquit him cunningly of ye matter. Notwithstanding (Mada said he) sithece my duty bindeth me to obey you, of .2. faults I wil eschue the greatest, hauing assurance that the reuerence I beare vnto your comaundements, wil serue to warrant my disabilitie and make my goodwil find fauor among this learned audience. And if I acquit my duty but slenderly, I wil cast the blame on you, who haue set me on worke, attributing yet this youre comaundement for greater honor than my merite dareth expecte to receiue. Wherof most humbly I thanke you. Then after ech one was placed vpon the bloming hearbs, Sire Bel Acoeuil bega thus. As there is no venym so dangerous, as that which couereth his bitternesse vnder some apparant sweetenesse: euen so experiment wee no mischiefe so pernicious, as yt which is cloaked wyth some fained goodnesse: for by the apparance of ye good, the suspecte of ye euill ceaseth, which hindreth men to take no heede, but too late: Oh, if Catilina, Scilla, Iulius C aesar , & their likes coulde haue dissembled their ambition so cuningly as Augustus , the tyranny of ye Romaines, which men call a Monarchy, had not bin begon so late. But what? their great courage, wherin treason neither findeth harbour (for ye Foxes wiles neuer entreth in the Lions body) permitted them not to playe the Crocodils parte, who weepeth to deuoure them that pitie him, and approch to his plainte. And it is a mischiefe so common, as those whyche are mated therwith, ought to take comfort, in that they haue many companions. For if we woulde collect the diuers successes of comon wealths sometime most florishing, we should easyly perceiue, yt they haue beene all deceiued by this domestical enimye, whiche men call faire semblant, and reason hath bin the comon staffe wherwith they haue bin beaten and ouerthrown. Nowe to the ende that the Realme of Fraunce be not esteemed exepte of this maladie, wee see that those whom the kings thereof haue moste pleasured, haue bin their moste sworne enimies. And that it is so, Hystories are repleate, howe dutifull and painefull Fraunce hath alwaies beene to defende the Romaine Popes, of whome Charles the greate, restored twoo that were driuen awaye by the King of Lumbardie : but for recompence of hys benefittes, hathe hee not hardelye preserued Fraunce theyr mother from beeing spoiled and vtterlye destroyed by the? haue they not alwaies most grieuously wounded France? hath France euer had greater enimies? it grieueth me to say so, but much more that it is so openly notified, that these babes after they had placed their proude foote not onely vppon the throte of this Emperour, compelling him to serue them as a slaue: but aboue al, haue directly stirred all christian crownes againste the Frenchmen their restorers. As Pope Pius euidently shewed, giuing ye realme of Cicil vnto Farrand the bastard,  & the duchie of, Milan to Frauncis , to the gret preiudice of the houses of Orleans and Aniow the lawfull heires: and Boniface ye seuenth, by his malicious excomunications, according to his meaning, had subuerted ye estate of France, if he had found some Charles ye simple,  & not valiant Philip the faire. But ye example of Pope Julie may suffise vs, who not contented with his spiritual weapons (which are vpon increpations, excomunicatios  & Anathematismes) determined to strike another stroke, forsaking ye keyes of S. Peter to vndertake ye sword of S. Paule : Sending an army into cape against ye good king, father of ye people, which had giue vnto him. Bolongna, Seruia, Rauenna, Imola, Fauenza, Forlina , with diuers other goodly dominions, which could not satisfie his ambition so vnsatiable, but yt he wold bath the earth wt humain bloud, kindling a Christianitie to destroy ye frenchmen, whome he besieged within Milan , hauing for executors of his holy rage, al christian Princes at his diuotion without all power notwithstanding to preuaile, for ye god of heauen was against him. Now whilest his holinesse stoode vpon these tearmes, there happened a memorable matter, the which I will declare vnto you as briefly as the strange pity of the cause may permit. For you must vnderstand (gratious damoisels) yt this cruell Pope beding daily his snares  & subtilties to win & draw to ye bent of his bowe, ye princes whiche he knew had any means to harme the frenchme, found matter to practise wt the yong Prince of Vmbria , whose name I will conceale for ye small glorie he shal gaine by my Historie. This prince, whether it wer for his reuerence vnto the Pope, or for ye loue he bare vnto ye honor of armes, shewed himselfe so affectionate, as he suffered none occasion of cobate to escape, wherat he was not one of ye first, wherby happened, yt after he had in perso frequented many perilous encouters, according as the name of the frenchmen solicited  & vrged him, he was enforced (after the siege of Milan was raised) to repaire for his refreshing vnto Matua , wher as his estate  & qualitie required, he was very honorably receiued of the Marquesse, the widowe of the famous Frauncis Gonzaga the laste of yt name, by whome shee had among their pretious iewels, one daughter of the age of .xv. yeres, a creature of exquisite beautie, as Italy ought iustly to reioice in ye production of suche a floure. This virgin aswel for hir noblenesse, as for yt she was the only care of hir parents, was from hir youth noursed wt Uertues teate,  & instructed with carefull diligence, so as if a ma considered ye graces & perfectios wherewith the heauens had richly endued hir, to compare them with the gentility of hir mind and honest disciplines, which study had made hir atchieue, it was hard to iudge if she were more beholding to Art, or to Nature. But it was easie to giue cosent, that in al Italy she had not hir equall, so as if the Pope wan  & practised many people vnto his seruice by aucthoritie & money, she iustly obtained as many hartes by the glaunces of hir beautifull eyes, seeing and pressing them so surely as might be desired, by the simple opinion of hir good fauoure, the which vnder this hope, durste not haue desired by a sweete deathe, to testifie theyr violent affection. Whereof this prince whome wee will name Adilon is my faithfull witnesse, who erewhiles was a Souldioure of the Pope, and euen nowe became the Champion of a moste diuine deitie. Alas, he hadde well experimented the force of the launces encounter, but he knewe not yet howe muche more vigorous an vnexpected looke was glaunced at vnwares. Hee was retourned verye honourablye from most daungerous enterprises, and nowe beholde hym ouerthrowne without hope, by one onely viewe of thys beautie, so as it hadde beene happye for him, if he hadde beene borne blinde, sith that hys eyes broughte hym so greate domage. Alas, by seeing somewhat too much, hee sawe hymselfe so chaunged, not knowing how, as he knewe not himselfe. Notwithstanding, as a yong Lion (that trusting in his nimble forces defieth all) the firste tyme hee is assayled, hee gathereth togither his enraged madnesse,  & redoubleth his courage to become the coqueror: eue so this new souldi- of Loue, resolued himselfe to stand manfully against ye assaults whiche his owne desires deliuered vnto him, bandying one against another, like mutenous citizens, finding no ruder enimy tha himself. And being fully determined to resist this first onset with one selfe hand gaue his hart both to the wound & playster, I must of necessity, said he in his minde, whilest this new melodie hath yet taken no root inwardly, assaye to expulse it by some present remedie: for the most soueraign medicine, is to restrain it in time: for the fire which newly beginneth to kindle, is more easily extinguished than being intierly inflamed. O what difference is betwixt wel doing, and wel saying, which causeth those that commend Uertue, to follow, & imbrace it so coldely? Alas, we see this poore louer councelleth himselfe the best in ye world, but he vseth not his owne good counsel, neither blusheth to make himselfe a lyar, by a repentance wherof, he repented him immediately. He yeeldeth the fortresse vnto the enimy, and determineth to hoode himselfe with this strange frensie: for as the stag bearing the arrow in his flanke, the more he flyeth his death, & with vncertaine steppes straieth among the thickets, so much ye more he aduaunceth his end, thrusting the forked yron alwayes further into his bodie, by the incounter of euery brushy branch: or as a lymed byrde the more she struggleth the more she is entangled: euen so this poore prince (the new pryse and conqueste of loue,) the more he inuertued himselfe to tame his insolente euill, the more he rendered his wound open and dangerous, so as by this pleasant entertainmet he felt his hart so won, as from ye time forward it harbored no more in himself, but the harbinger of loue had marked a lodging for it in the face of faire Clarinda , for so was the faire yong Ladie of Mantua called. Alas, if simple obiect of this perfection hath so sore dazeled (like the glaring sun beames) the eyes of his reason, what had chaunced I pray you, if he had practised to winne hir gracious fauour, by any amiable deuises? or if by frequetation he had obtained knowledge of hir wise & modest conditions, & hadde noted by experience with what rare wisdome hir minde was enriched, which she made to distil from the Hony of hir tong, to inebriate the most learned eares: for as I haue saide, she had not hir like on that side the mounts: but (it may be) Cassandra the daughter of S. Angesidely a Uenetian, who red the publike lecture in the seue liberal sciences,  & was wel studied in Theologie, writen aswel in Greeke as in latin. The yog prince not hauing yet but scarsely half viewed this princesse, retyred al pensiue towards his lodging, wherhoping to finde rest by the absence & distace of that which caused his greefe, he felt his fansie assayled with newe charges: for if the presence of his delicate death had kindled in him many passions, the corporall absence thereof beeing more liuely imprinted and represented in the bottome of his hart, was a thousand folde more greeuous vnto him, as we see a wounde ake muche more after it be dressed, than when ye stroke is receyued in choler. So as making semblant to suppe by acquittaunce, al dremy and straying in the forest of thoughts, he went to bedde, where thinking to finde release and ease of his greefes, founde al quite contrarie to his expectation: for the soft downe to others, was to him a harde pillow, vpon the which he forged a thousande fantasticall proincts, which as soone as they were stifeled, vanished away, and were consumed in the ayre with a tempest of sighes, which kindled the furnace of his vnsounde conceytes. And the more he assayed to breake his amorous snarle, the straighter he knit the enuious line of his libertie. As we see a water course enforce his violence, when it is stayed by an opposite sluice: so after long restraynt of his molestation, he brake out into exclamations, saying: Alas vnto what mischeefe hath my destinie made me subiect? howe chaunceth it that I forsake luckily the hazards of wars, exempt from the danger of weapons, to be so euill intreated of Ladies, where eche man findeth assuraunce? O God, wherefore can I not defende me as well from tender Maydens, as I doo from rude knights? Ah why haue the heauens assigned me vnto so feeble puissaunce? at lest if they concluded to yeeld vnto the eyes offensiue weapons, why haue they not rampered the breast with defensiue armour? Oh howe happie had I bin if the enemie had slayne me with the flower of Italie, rather than to escape, and comming hither for consolation, to dye in languishing, and finishe my youth without honour, like Achilles among the damoysels of Licomydes : consuming (like snowe) agaynst the beames of this beautie. Alas, for my weale and quiet I ought neuer to haue seene it, or if it behoued me to beholde it. I ought neuer to haue lost ye sight therof. O valiaunt French knight, who vnder the horror of thy prowesse makest the world to tremble, haue not, I saye, haue not fro henceforth no more despight at the first vertue of prince Adilon . And if I can no more harme thee, giue thanks therfore vnto the Princesse of Mantua , who hath depriued me of all rest to yeelde thee quiet: not as hauing slayne me, or sworn me thy friende, but by keeping me cruelly captiue in so straight prison, as hereafter al men may take example of seruice so vngratefully recompenced in me. For what greater ingratitude may be found, than so euill to handle such as come by visitation to doo honor  & reuerence to a Lady? Ah howe hath God created at one time a bloudy bishop to kill the body, & a miraculous beauty to slea the soule, & both for the ruine of poore Italy. Thus the desolate Lord flaming more & more in loue, passed ye night in teares and sighes, so as now he resolued his minde to pursue the effect of his new attempt, then persuaded his fancy that no goodnesse was gotten without trauel, as also the matter was worth his trauell. Againe, he determined to forsake the price, and not to torment him selfe with beleefe for a thing so vncertayne as a man could perceiue nothing whervpon to build any assurance, but only a foolish hope. Who hath not seene a traueler when he meeteth two seueral wayes, remaine amazed with doubt whether of the two he should choose, mistrusting least the one or the other should bring him out of the way? Euen so the case stoode with this poore louer, who hauing long poised betwene the hope and feare of his doubtfull thoughts, leaped out of the bed into the floore, and appareled his person from top to toe. Then resolued to put spurres vnto his new practises, flying so farre the beloued corpse, as loue coulde not followe him, he mounted on horsebacke, & tooke the way directly to Placenza , where at that time the Pope had assembled his forces. He went his way, guided by his seruauntes and his horse: for he that was no more his owne man to gouerne him selfe, could hardely gouerne or conduct others. He departed then, but his spirite which would be no longer his guest, remained in garison at Mantua , leauing the body like an Image, which driuen by the wind seemeth to moue by fits, yet had no life but by the sorow yt gnawed vpon his hart. Beeing ariued at Placenza , he went to do his duty vnto ye Popes holinesse, who he found fitly for the purpose in his chamber, inuenting some mischeeuous practise against the Frenchme. And after accustomed embracings: good Lord my childe (sayd July ) where haue you bin so long, that I could heare no news of you: I assure you I feared greatly I had lost you, finding no ma that could tel me what was become of you: but nowe your arriuall hath bereeued me of a great molestatio. The Prince knowing how dear he was vnto the Pope, made the best excuse he could, dissembling what the matter was, for the reuerence he bare vnto him. But bicause euery man read easily in his face that his mind was euil intreated,  & that some secret worme gnawed vpon his accustomed ioy, a Gentleman who he most fauoured and was familiar with him, entreated him so instantly, as thorow his importunitie the Prince could not gaynsay to discouer al the whole matter vnto him. Whervpon he sayd: Lucydan my friend, I thanke thee for the care thou hast of me, which maketh thee to suspect that I breede some maladie caused by excesse. I assure thee, thy doubtful coiecture hath not much missed ye truth: for I haue bin so greeuously wounded (euen in the place whither I was retired for myne assuraunce  & safetie) as I attend none other remedie but a lingering death. For thou shalt know that the siege beeing raised before Millan by the enemie, I went to lye at Mantua , intending to refreshe my tedious trauayles: but such a fire caught holde there vpon me, and sodeynly so enflamed me, as all the water in the Sea can not quenche me, whiche I pray you to keepe secrete, in remembrance of the good estimation I haue of you, which permitteth me not to coceale any thing fro you. Then opening his hart, he discouered from the edge to the middle, how he was attaint  & surmounted by the sweete entertainement of the princesse Clarinda ,  & of the greefe which he had endured afterward, which was now so great as it could increse no more. How now sir (said Lucida ) if fortune haue wel prouided for you, what cause haue you to complaine of hir? but wherfore are you so vniust in your good cause, to pronounce agaynst your selfe both accusation and condemnation? Wherefore suspect you rigour or disgrace, where you haue yet founde but all lenitie and curtesie? and sithence you haue not any matter of miscotentmet, wherfore haue you mistrust in your forces and merits, which shall neuer encounter refuse in a gentle hart. No no, be of good courage, I protest vnto you, that you shall shortly enioy your desire, sithence it is so loftily lodged, or else all my labour and industry shall fayle me. And I beseeche you repose your care vpon the promise of an assured friende  & faithfull seruaunt. But I pray you (bicause mine age hath yeelded me some experience, and that there is not in you so good iudgement as loue blindeth not) that in this you will be ruled by my counsaile, which is, that aboue all things you make singular account (if you will seeke a shorte and assured way) to court the mother, and carefully to practise hir, not sparing any parte of your endeuour therein: for hauing once gayned place in the good opinion of the mother, the good will of the daughter is alreadie wonne: and to tell you how, the maide is like a fayre white wall, which receyueth all impressions, and if a man striketh his hande thereon, all that which was coloured is wyped away: euen so, she nowe loueth all, and forthwith lyketh nothing. Floures dye euery yere, and doo yeerely spring agayne, but the loue of maidens springeth and dieth euery day, without any apparaunce of certentie therein, but this infallible rule, that alwayes the first chaseth away the laste, as men see one waue driue another, so greatlye noueltie pleaseth a voluble minde. Otherwise it might be sayde, they haue no loue at all, as creatures too cruell for so sweete a guest, and that their affections wandereth hither and thither, making intertaynement to euery one, with suche countenaunce as they please to counterfayte in despight of their heart, which they make a liar, and haue not any discretion or choyce, vntil the mothers haue meshed them in the nettes of ordinarie mariage. Finally, consider well if Maydens when they are woed, referre them not wholly to the will and pleasures of their parentes, without power, or not once daring to say (I loue) vntill they be bounde in the bands of wedlocke: Resembling butterflyes, which flicker from flowre to flowre indifferently (according as the varietie of their wauering delight bloweth them) without any more staye vpon one than on an other, to the ende to taste of all, wandering here and there, vntill some Spiders webbs hath stayed them. Wherefore credite mine aduice, and persuade your selfe, that if the mother loue and esteeme you, the daughter is yours. As men say, the Towne wonne, the Castell yeeldeth. These speeches collected ententiuely by a friende, and noted by the young Prince, so enbaulmed and knit the wounds of his minde, as I knowe not if euer the consolation of a Confessor contented more the desperate sinner. And during this healthful fomentation, newes came that the Frenchmen growen proude by the repulse and rearing the siege of Milan , pursued the effect of their good fortune, proceeding in the wafting  & great domage of the Church lands, which caused the Pope with diligence to sende for Cesar Burgia , who had all the forces of Vmbria and Peuilla , enioyning the Uenetians  & the Spaniards to lye in camp, and to assemble their power to withstande the bolde enemie. Whervpon it fortuned, that the two armies beeing encountred neere a small village called Lugo , they gaue the onset so furiously, as the better part of the strength of July and the Venetians were slayne in the first charge, with smal losse vnto the Frenchmen, who not contented with their victorie and masterie of the fielde, made their accompt to roote vp all the race of their enemies, as not onely contending for honour, but for the sauegard of their liues and tranquilitie. Wherfore Gastonde Foix duke of Nemors , nephew and lieutenaunt generall of the king, a prince of soueraigne valiauntnesse, pricked on by an honour of glory, and by boyling youth, pursued the fugitiues of the battayle so liuely, as his good fortune beeing too muche vrged and importuned, made him a false bounde, as a horse beeing too soone spurred, boundeth and ouerthroweth his rider to the earth. Oh how wise was the Captayne, who said, that to constraine the enemie too much, was the meane to giue him weapon to defende him selfe: but also thoughte it moste expedient to make hym a golden bridge to flye awaye. For the lawe of necessitie is so extreme (sayde the diuine Plato ) that the very Goddes coulde not resist the same: and his Disciple affirmed necessitie to be the mother of false vertues, and likewise performeth false myracles. Finally, we see that the sonne of Cresus , beeing naturally dumbe, seeing (after the Towne of Suzes was taken) a souldier who would haue slayne hys father, scryked out (Saue the crowne) so great puissaunce had naturall affection, as it amended the defecte of nature by a necessarie myracle. Whereby this stoute warriour the Duke of Nemours oughte to haue vsed soberlye his glorious victorie, obtayned neere to Rauenna , without enforcing the fugitiues vnto an extreme necessitie of defence: remembring that but lately before the Frenchemen (beeing pressed by the league made agaynst Charles the eyght) with victorious sworde opened the waye whiche by mayne force was locked from them. Euen so at this instant our Italians made (as men say) of the same bread the lyke soppes: for beeing in flight, yet neuerthelesse pressed at their backes, and so straightly pursued after their discomfiture, ioyned togither, and with a desperate courage turned their faces, encountering the moste hardie pursuer with suche violence, as the Duke of Nemours , (beeing one of the sharpest) was there slayne, with the Lorde of Mounte Carauel , the Lorde de Alegre the father, and other notable knightes: but the young Lorde of Alegre made a little better market, remayning the prisoner (after he had receyued a wounde in hys arme, whereby he coulde no longer defende him selfe) of Don Ferdinando Gonzaga , who ledde him presently out of the fielde: wherein he dyd wisely: for the Frenchemen, who vnhappilly during these broyles stayed behinde ransacking the deade, supposing to enioy the fruite of their assured victorie, whiche detayned their duetifull attendaunce from their good Duke, hearing by the retyrers of this recharge that the enemie turned head, ranne to the hurley burley; but it was too late, for as I haue sayde, the Duke was alreadie slayne, which was the cause that being vnable to giue any other remedie, (no more than the Phisition comming after the death of the Pacient,) conuerted the sorrowe and pitie of him into cruell vengeaunce of their enemies. And without receyuing any to mercie, they executed of humayne bodies an inhumayne butcherie, especially vnderstanding that some of them were fledde to Rauenna , beeing the nexte Citie, for safegarde of their lyues, with an vntamed furie they besieged and tooke it, where banishing all remission and grace, they imprinted the rigorous markes of their iust choler. Now after a miserable destruction of the beste Cities in Italie, but principally of Lumbardie, the Pope to driue the Frenchemen oute of hys Countreys, stirred the Englishemen, who landed at Callis , to besiege Turwine , whiche constrayned them to forsake Italie to defende the power of Englande. Thus the Potentates enioying some quiet, and taking breath, determined vpon the raunsomes and exchaunges of prisoners taken in these warres, so as it was concluded to render the Lorde de Alegre for the Marquesse of Pescara . Nowe Don Gonzaga hauing conueyed and saued him (as I haue sayde) had ledde him vnto a strong Cassell of his, two myles distaunt from Mantua , or thereaboutes: There he was well intreated for the account the Frenchemen made of him, and the opinion which the Italians had that he was some great Lorde. So as one day among others, when the weather was fayre, his keeper meaning to shewe him euery office of curtesie, caried him on hunting to a wood adioyning to his Castell, wher togither they coursed a Stagge whiche lodged abroade, with so liuely affection as they lost all their people, without regarde or care of any thing, but who shoulde be first at the fall of the beast. And they were greatly abashed, when beeing well in their waye, they drewe neare vnto a fayre and delightfull Fountayne, so well couered with greene leaues, as all entrie was wholly defended vnto the Sunne. In this delicate place by good aduenture was euen then a company of Damoysels, who vnder this shadowe tooke the freshe of the daye. Assoone as our Hunters had discouered this beautyfull assemblie, the Lorde Gonsaga knowing from farre that it was hys sister the Marquesse , who was comme thyther accompanied wyth hir daughter, aduertised hys prisoner, and galloping gallauntly together vppon the spurre, at the ende of their carire, setting foote on grounde, they wente to doe their dueties vnto the Lady, wyth whome they fayled not to finde the Prince Adilon , who hauing truce wyth armes, but not with loue, was come to practise the good lessons of hys friende Lucydan , following the whiche, he studyed so diligentlye to court the Mother, as the daughter esteemed thys fyne deuise very foolishenesse, imputing it to proceede of some rude and chyldishe shame, and was so sore discontented with his endeuour, as in hir heart she both despised and disdayned him. The young Lord of Alegre hauing vsed such honour and reuerence towardes the Marquesse as hir merite required, rolled his eyes rounde about him: but he was permitted no such free libertie to dispose them, for their vagabounde beames were immediatlye arrested by the perfections of the young Princesse, whome hauing aduised alone, destitute of all company, to holde hir talke he beganne to frequent the maner of Fraunce: and to diminishe nothing of his duetie, he encountred hir in so good order, and entertayned hir with so gracious deuisings, as shee had iustlye wherevppon to contente hir mynde with hys happie arriuall, whiche recompenced the defectes of Adilon . And although hys porte, courtlynesse, and behauiour, considering well his noblenesse and good education: also the countenaunce and honour whiche Don Gonzaga shewed towards him, made him gretly honored of at the company (whiche found it neuerthelesse somewhat straunge, that he had so sodenly syded the Lady, agaynst the custome of the countrey, but much more contrary to the good will of the iealous Prince) notwithstanding the good graces which in hir beautifull youth was comendable, rendred him so much esteemed,  & conquered in such sorte the hearts of euery one vnto hym, as willing, nilling, it behoued enuy to hang the heade. Nowe after they had passed this parte of the day in greate pleasure, the Marquesse desired his brother and the Lord of Alegre to ride to Mantua with hir: Whervnto they willingly consented for diuers considerations: Gonzaga to shewe his prisoner something worthy of reporte in France, and Alegre for the continuance of hys good beginning. Then they tooke their way towards the towne, a long the whiche, Loue, who neuer strayed out of the eyes of beautifull Clarinda , made so large a wounde in the tender harte of this newe Courtier, as onely death coulde remedy the same, as you shall vnderstande. And although the poore Louer had many companions in his misery (for a thousand and a thousand were wounded with the loue of this faire creature) so it fell out, that he had wherein to comforte himselfe, in that none were partakers of his glorie, bycause he was so happy and fortunate, as receiuing one stroke he gaue another, and if the hurte were large and daungerous in the breaste of the knight, it spared nothing the young Princesse, who by the vnexpected arriuall of the knight, felte hir senses so attainted at vnwares, by hys gentilitie, as she was forced to begin to learne what it was to loue. So as hauing noted diligently an infinite number of good graces and vertues in hir French Gentleman, and making a secrete comparison of them, she knewe not at which to meruaile moste: but she perceyued well that nothing coulde be more desired in the accomplishement of any humaine perfection. So as being vnable by hir face, (whiche for hir aduauntage she kepte vncouered) to dissemble the good will she bare hym, shee gaue hym hardinesse peaceably to discouer hys newe griefe, to the ende to receyue comforte by a present remedy: wherefore drawne by a hope of fauoure, promised by this delicate beautie (which being the cause of his torment, had ministred a ready recouer,) and as who should saye, by a babbling eye, receyuing some small assuraunce, he brake the lines wherewyth feare, enimy to all aduauncement, tyed his tongue faste, and after a profounde sigh, hee sayde vnto hir: Ah good Madame, howe may I sufficiently complayne of my rigorous fortune, which not contented to depriue mee of all my parents and friendes, wythout all newes what issue they haue hadde in thys hazardous battell, from whence (sithence the best be there slayne) they can be hardely escaped, and not being contented to conducte me into a strange lande, prisoner vnto him that sought my life, haue at this daye vtterly to ouerthrow me, bereaued me of my small hope which remained of a happy libertie, which ought to haue restored my losses vnto me. For alas, within these fewe houres shee hathe bound mee so strictely to obey the excellent graces which shine in you, that whereas vntill thys time I was prisoner but of bodye, from henceforth I am become captiue both of bodye and soule, euen so straitly, as I knowe not what enlargement I ought to expecte, not hauing any other than it shal please your mercye to graunte me of youre meere grace. And I am charmed in suche sorte (pardon me thoughe I cannot lye) that (as the pacient which is broughte into a deadly sleepe by the iuyce of Mandrake , to haue his mebers cut off) I feele not my harme, but in steede of harte I finde so greate contentment in my misery, as mee thinketh truely there is no suche felicitie in the worlde, as the paine I endure, nor anye libertie so pleasaunt as the harde prison of so beautifull a Goailoresse, nor life so delicious, which may counteruaile the blisse and benefite whiche I expect, dying in your amorous seruice. Uttering these speaches, he behelde the princesse with so languishing an eye, as he tooke from hir al power to answere any worde, losing hir speach, as such as haue encountred a Wolfe at vnwares. And the passioned Ladye beeing vnable to replie, clasped his hande so closelye, as by hir mute language she testifyed sufficiently what assaultes she sustained in hir soule. Wherfore the Louer feeling the spur pricke in his flanke, by thys firste fauoure, al enuironed with affection, tooke breath, and pursued his tale, saying: But O God what straunge aduenture (as contrary to my expectation, as fauourable vnto my desires) hathe conducted a hunter, whose endeuoure was to take in the place where hymselfe hathe beene taken with the gratious toiles; stalled by so puissaunt a huntresse, as vsing the vertue of a Goddesse, hathe rendred me lyke poore Acteon , but that Acteon was transformed into a Harte, bycause he sawe Diana naked, and I become hartlesse by the onely viewe of my Lady in hir apparell. And I suppose by thys reckening, that whosoeuer shoulde beholde you naked, shoulde become an immoueable stone, as those which viewed Medusa . Jesu, I neuer beleeued vntill this instant that a man shoulde finde Nimphs, Driades,  & Oreades about fountaines (as Poets reporte) neither thought I euer their encounters had beene so daungerous. O Seigneur Baleas , feare not now that I will steale awaye vnto my friendes, for I am so surelye enchaunted here by the beautie of your neece, as I neede none other keeper but hir sighte. And as the Greekes in olde tyme, after they hadde tasted all delicates in the straunge Ilande of good Lot, forgat the desire to retourne any more into their country: So beyng sweetly suckeled wyth the good graces which distill from hir beautifull eyes, I wil rather suffer cruell death than hir absence. And herein alas, you make me paye dearelye for the benefite and entertaynment receyued of you, aggrauating myne agreement contrary to the lawe of Armes, and youre promise whiche oughte to be inuiolable: for I coulde escape youre handes, leauing therein (in place of my bodye) some raunsome of money, but this prison (saide hee beholdyng the Princesse) will accepte none other raunsome but life, to delyuer and make free my bodye. Ah Madam what disaster maye menne viewe more coniured to destroye a miserable wretche than mine? Alas, moueth it you not vnto pitie and compassion? It resteth in you alone to reuenge my wrong, whiche I beseeche you to dispatche quickly, if you desire to saue the life of a faithful seruat, whom you haue this day coquered, stealing on me with your ambush, as ye fowler taketh ye bird, whose vnprouided wings betray the body. Whervnto ye faire Lady answered wt a flattering smiling: Uery wel (my Lord,) if the fortune of war (whiche neuer testeth with cowardes or caitiues) hath concluded to make you my vncles prisoner, I see not anye cause you haue to complaine, being falle into so friendly hands: me thinketh your aduerse fortune coulde not yelde you greater glorie, hauing bin valiantly taken in the troupes of the moste couragious and hardy warriours of Fraunce, by one, who in feates of armes, is without comparison in all Italy . But I finde it more strange to heare you complaine of me, who if so be I coulde haue deliuered you the leaste occasion, contrarywise I woulde esteeme me muche bounde to my good Fortune, if it had putte me in place where I might shewe you the plasure I wishe, as you shall knowe, when tyme and place shal serue, whiche I will searche duryng my lyfe, and shall not so soone find it, as it will seeme too late vnto my desires. For the admirable graces, whyche in this small time I haue marked in you, haue so greate puissaunce to force the wills of them which haue neuer so little humanitie, and can gaine so good place in the heartes of the moste barbarous, as I knowe not wyth what penaunce, or rather wyth what plague I shoulde punishe, (if I were the Iudge) the least displeasure that any man might purchase you, if happily there liued anye so vnnaturall. A, ha Madam, (aunswered the Knight) entreate you youre guests thus, feasting them with scoffes for theyr comforte? So it is (deare dame) that whatsoeuer you please to say (considering the greate puissaunce you haue vppon me) I will certainely assure you, thoughe Nature hathe beene nigardely vnto me in perfections; and liberal of affections requisite to him, who by heauenly fauoure shoulde haue the happinesse to become yours, and auowched of you for suche one, yet the little which is in this body, hath bin vowed, and shall be employed in your seruice, wherein I am so resolued, as no iniurye of tyme, or wante of power, can minister any impeachement therevnto. And touching that you demaunde what cause I haue to complaine of you. Alas, Madam it is not bycause I am slidden by youre vnexpected viewe into an eternall prison (whiche was prepared for me from my childehoode to finishe my beste affections) for greater good happe coulde not chaunce vnto mee, to recompence in one daye all the disasters of my life. But I complaine (Madam) bycause mine aduenture hathe directed me to a place where the merits of all liuing creatures are neither worthy or sufficient to deserue any grace. Notwithstanding, if it were permitted vnto a good wil to hope wel, or if Loue wer so good a maister, as a man might gaine anye rewarde for hys faithfull seruice, I durst well promise my selfe the happinesse wherof I esteeme the whole world vnworthy. For as Nature hathe contended with hir selfe, to shew howe gallant a workmaistresse she was in fashioning your body so perfectly, to expose it vnto the meruaile of all men: Euen so hath she pleased in my person to frame you a seruaunte, who hathe not in loyaltie hys like: And I dare well saye (pardon thys small wrong whiche I doe you) that she hathe not collected and assembled moe graces in you to imparte to others, than shee hathe heaped in my hearte deuoute affections for your loyall seruice, whiche assureth me, that if iuste recompences ensue faithfull trauailes, or if being well beloued bindeth to loue wel, I haue wherevppon to feede my sterued care wyth the nourishement of good hope of youre fauoure and grace. At these wordes Clarinda was so assailed by Loue and shame: as hir poore heart knewe not (in this agony) vnto whiche to yeld, and the tongue attending which of the two shoulde haue the victory, stoode quiet, seruing but for an vnprofitable bundle vnto the mouth, vntill the fortresses of the minde being liuely besieged yelded vnto ye mercy of victorious Loue, who vsing his power gaue libertie to speech which shame had kept prisoner, the which creeping all trembling oute of the beautifull mouth of the Maiden was suche: But wherefore my friende mistruste you youre good happe, whiche attendeth you vnto the coronation of youre amorous desires? Oh what greater assuraunce woulde you haue of my loue, than that whiche in despight of my hearte I declare vnto you at thys instante? what more hautie glory attende you, than to leade me wyth triumph, by the victorie whiche Loue hathe gotten you vpon me, forcing my rebellious desires by the efficacie of youre good graces? But I will aduertise you betimes (bycause you Frenchmen haue the reporte to be light and wauering, vaunting you and searching commendation with the expence of Ladies honours, which is or ought to bee ioyned with youre owne) that in this case, (and therfore bethinke you before you passe any further) if you shewe your selfe a flattering Frenchman, you shal fynde of me a dissembling Italian, that wyll hold your byll in the water and yelde you nothing to drinke but the licoure of mockerie. Wherfore, my friend, I recommend to you faith and secrecy, which is the only crown to glorify blessedly true louers and to make the raigne ouer enuye. Whereof you shal bethinke you, in wearing this Iewell for my loue. Now this ring had for his stone a Cupido crowned very minionly, being cut in an Agat, whiche had his handes ioyned, but that he held one finger right vp in his mouth, and within for the deuice was written, faith and securitie . I cannot wel persuade you how the fortunate louer receiued this faire preset, but so it is (I pray you so beleue) yt he had not refused it though it had bin as hotte as a fierbrand. Nowe after hee had graciously thanked his gracious mistresse, with hande, eye  & mouth, as he would haue proceeded in further talk, great multitude of ye youthful nobility & getery issued out of ye citie, in so huge troupes, as though the town had passed out at the gates. This company being come to the presence of the Marquesse, intermedled them so rudely amog the damosels, as they interrupted the secrete Louers, whom they conducted vnto the palaice of the signiorie, where being ariued, al the prease founde the tables couered for supper. But alas, so manye dainty dishes, serued wt so great pompe and magnificence, were not sufficient to satisfye the sterued spirites of these two, who seeyng occasion abrogated to continue their affectionate talke anye loger, cheared their mindes during the feast, for ye delicate foode of their soules, with only lokes, which very often iusting at ye encounter, rendered both parties at euery attaint vanquished and victorious. O Loue how straunge a thing art thou, and of what straunge nature, who for thy most sauorous and delicious meate, feedest vpon paine and care, wherof the more thou deuourest the lesse thou art satisfied. Alas, ye gluttonous-bloudsucker in fine falleth fro the woud, sleaing it selfe by his proper nourishment: but thou (belly god) deuouring wt gret morsels ye harts of thy subiects without consuming the, art neuer glutted more tha the Eagle, who cotinually deuoureth ye liuer of ye miserable damned wight. And these perplexed louers deliuered sufficiet testimony, yt as two flints striken togither, disburse the fier hidde in their intrayles, so by ye kindling of their ardant regardes they mutually consumed their houses: The violence whereof was such, as it was not onely felt of them two, but as it is vnpossible to hyde a Fier, which both by the heat and brightnesse betrayeth it self, was sodainly perceyued of the most curious, but especially of the prince Adilon , who being marked with the same seale, knewe not how to apease his iealous fantasie, nor to let himselfe from hauing alwayes an eye to ye wood. And he failed not now to kepe diliget watch vpon the countenaunce of Clarinda , as he shortly discouered yt she gaue entrie vnto his enimy, who softly  & sweetely making his approches, cut the grasse vnder hir feete, and discharged hyr of the good graces, wherein hee supposed him selfe to be so firmely anckered, as al the windes could not once make hym bowe. What shal he do? Now wt a ruful loke he fought to couert his mistresse to his partie, reprouing hir of the smal accompte hir legeritie made of his auntient seruice: then by a sterne countenace, like a Basiliske , to mortifie his harty Loue. But his eyes profited him nothing neither of the one part nor ye other,  & serued him to no purpose but to see too much, breding a worme in his heart which gnawed so ye quicke, yt it behoued him to lose the visage of his dissimulation. The which Lucidan perceyuing, scoffed at his suspitio so fondly grounded, and taking him asyde after supper, spake these words: Although loue neuer flieth wtout feare  & iealousie vnder his wings, yet ought not this feare to be so blind as it is, but ought to haue respecte to torment himselfe by credite, and to doe lyke the Austrich , that pricketh hyr selfe to make hir runne. And I thinke it greate simplenesse to bee assured vppon a looke, and curiouslye to obserue the markyng thereof, pryncypallye among the straungers, which frequet copany very seldome or neuer, haue seen ech other, which was ye chief cause wherfore ye princesse had hir eies so firmly fixed vpo these frechme, through hir feminine curiosity. This I perceiued at supper did trouble your coscience, wherevpon I haue presumed thus farforth to aduise you. These reasons attetiuely cosidered, somewhat moderated the princes minde, notwithstanding he was extremely displeased bycause the grief of the gout through the change of time had seazed Monsieur Gonsagua , which caused the Lorde de Alegre to soiorne in the Marquise house, where this yong prince Adilon was so welcome, as all wished he had bin sonne in lawe vnto the Marquise , and I belieue, for his part he wold not haue gainesayd it. Thus by his priuie frequentation, it happened one day entring softly from chamber to chamber, he beheld the princesse alone, combing hir fayre haire displayed against the sunne beames: whom he had no sooner viewed, as vrged on by a gallat hardinesse and amorous audacitie, he ran towards,  & seasing hir behind, held hir hard fast with both his hands, like those that in disporte will make men deuine who they be. At the first blush the faire Ladye started at thys vnexpected aprehension, then gathering again hir afrayde spirits, with a pretie sweete smiling she said, Jesu my lord Alegre is this the curtesie you Frenchmen can vse towardes Ladies, to catch them behind? you haue thereby made me sore affrayd, neyther thought I you had bene so hardie to come thus by assault to take a mayden alone in hir chaber. If the poore prince were abashed at these wordes, and verye hooke nosed, hauing found by his curiositie, that which he sought, I leaue it vnto your iudgements: but it may be easily presumed, that he wold willingly haue bin farre from thence, for he knewe not how to get away, knowing that the same which the princes would receiue by seing him, could conuert but to his domage, as the contrarie example of Giges and Candaules witnessed vnto hym. Wherfore distitute of al good counsel, he could not doe otherwise for the safegard of his honor, tha hold fast ye princes golde head, who returning hir speech, sayd: leaue, leaue, it is time not to disguise you any loger, ye visard serueth to smal effect when ye Mummer is known. Let me go good friend, it is not fro me you shold hide your face. At this 2. charge ye poore Lord could sustain no longer, seeing so assured testimony of the priuitie whiche hee moste feared, whereby he was seazed with such despight, as hauing viewed the place where he entred, he stole awaye slyly to scape the shame which his discouerture might bring him. Now if he departed throughly molested in his minde, he left the Princesse no lesse astonied, who although she turned hir head sodenly to view the fugitiue, she could not perceiue him by reason of hir haire flying in hir face, wherwt more angry tha tong can tel, bicause she had spoken so openly  & vnaduisedlye, and on the other side, despited that she fayled the knowledge of this hardy gamester, began to coniecture diuers matters, assuring hir selfe fully it was not hir Alegre : and that which chafed hir more, was the suspect it should be Adilon , whom she hated more than he loued hir, which was ye cause yt long time afterward she could not beholde him without shame, nor he hir, without euer any speech therof between theselues, nor report to any worldly wight. Also ye Prince determined to shew better countenance vnto the Lord Alegre , than he had done before, dissembling the cruel vengeace which he conspired in his fellonious courage. O vniust loue, what meanes hast thou to exercise thy tyrannie vpon humaine harts, of the which thou embracest some with blinde passions, other with enraged iealousie,  & suche as it pleaseth thee to handle more rudely, thou hammerest them with sorrowfull dispayre, making them to haue recourse and refuge vnto a bloody appetite of vengeance. As this despighted Louer coulde very wickedly practise, when seeing him selfe preuented of his amorous attemptes (although he were the first occupant) by this Frenche knight, whome he thought seemed vniustly to put hys sythe into an other mans haruest, suffered him selfe to be carried away, (lyke a chariot drawen with wylde horses,) by the violence of enuy, whiche for his quiet procured him to purchase the ruine of the man that neuer had offended hym. Hauing thus deliuered hys wyll vnto the mercy of this cruell deuice, employed all his care to finde some expedient meane for the execution of his rage, to the end that hauing no more any copanion which might disaduantage him so greatly, the coquest of his Ladies good graces might bee more easie vnto him, for that costeth least that is cheapened of fewe. Now the manner to bryng it about, semed vnto him very difficult to inuent, but more harde to execute. For, to assaile him by force of armes vpon an Almaine quarell forged at pleasure, whom he knew to be actiue and expert in skirmish, seemed not in his conceyte the surest way: Also to oppresse him by numbers of men, fayning it were in hatred of the french name, the Lord Gonsagua who helde him prisoner vnder safegard and protection of his warlike faith, had so noble an hart, as he would suffer no such vilany, but rather take the quarrel for his owne. In fine, after long deliberation, he founde no shorter way nor surer, than to aide himselfe wyth: poyson and sith he coulde not put on the slyue of a Lion, he clad him in a Foxes case, whiche he finished so fynely, as hee spared no embracings pertayning to a true friend, in feasting the Lord Alegre , who being a Frenchman, had hys hart free and voyde of suspition, being euil instructed that mistrust was the mother of surety. Whereby he payed so rigorous expences, as he learned other by his own domage. Oh how daungerous a thing is a traytour, who wyth the one hand presenteth bread, and in the other hand holdeth a stone to strike. And howe wise is he (sayde Byon ) who receyueth not euery one into amity? Alas, I maruell not thoughe the sages haue compared false friends, to crowes, Harlots, Flyes, Mise, Spiders  & other harmefull beastes: for all the malice of beasts is in one fained friend, as Adilon very wel witnessed. But who might not haue bin deceiued by him? And who woulde euer haue thought that the harbingers of treaso durst haue approched a princes hart, a gentleman, whose age, demeanour and good nurture ought violently to haue defended entrie vnto so wicked guestes? And muche lesse, who woulde haue suppossed, that Loue hym selfe woulde haue brought them in wyth hys consente? Loue (I say) who painters haue made all naked, and yet he appeareth here couered, seducing a minde and whetting the same vnto an ingenious felleny, whiche was such, as hauing employed greate store of money to recouer a poyson so subtile as no man coulde knowe, neither by taste nor coloure, which seemed to be borrowed of sugre: and vnder thys semblaunce, the same poyson (not long before) had poysoned a Pope, he founde the meanes to distill it into an apple, the fairest that might be gotten, euen by the hollownesse, where the stalke ioyneth the fruite vnto the tree, within yt place the venim pierced, in suche sort, that in a small tyme it spread hys force ouer all. This wicked fruite being thus seasoned, was by the Prince giuen to the French lord in great singularitie and commendation. and although he gaue it him like a companion, yet was it with intent to be his laste morsell. Neuerthelesse hys purpose succeeded not altogither according to hys accompte: for this poore Gentleman receyuing with great affection thys mortall present, aswell for the place whence it came, as for the beautie of the fruite, vowed it sodainely in good faith vnto hir, vnto whome he had there vowed hys person, knowing howe wel maids loue such meats. And he staied not long, but he wet to seeke hir, and found hir playing among hir damoysells, where being, as soone as he had plucked the vnfortunate fruite oute of his pocket, the yong Princesse snatched it with hir hand,  & wantonly set hir teeth therein, lodging (at vnwares) in hir feeble stomacke, the venime which laye in this sweetenesse. Alas, thys enimy of pitie without sparing his gratious Hostesse, staied not long to make hir feele his detestable force, deliuering so cutting assaultes vnto this innocente breaste, as the Uirgin was forced (after shee hadde by the chaunging of hir coloure testified hir sharpe and rigorous griefes) to retire into hir chamber, where vanquished by impatience, she threw hir body on a bed; and with diligence sent for hir mothers Phisition (who was in the Chamber of hir gowtye vncle) to come to hir. Hee at hys entraunce beeyng aduertized howe the disease hadde seased hir, supposed it hadde beene some Cholicke proceedyng of the rawe fruyte: But at the length hauyng caused the patient to shew him hir tong, seeing it al scorched & altered, but chiefely discouering certaine purple pushes, iudged they came by certain traces of an ardent venim: whervpon without delay he caused hir to receyue a strog counterpoyson of Metridate . But alas the venim had gained alreadye so forwarde in so small space, that hys mortall operation could not any more be withstoode, yet it was somewhat forslowed by the mixture of this violent sweetnesse, which was the cause that the phisition left the princesse in a little ease, and supposing hir to be preserued, departed the chamber, at ye dore wherof he met the Lord Alegre , who attended newes of his Ladyes disposition: And hauing vnderstoode by the Doctor, that she was poysoned with an apple (for the good man spake the truth freely not knowing any thing of the matter) the desolate louer was ready to lose his wits, feeling himselfe culpable of al this mischiefe. And that which most raue hys hart, was the maner wherby he was induced therevnto by his trayterous friende who had serued his tourne by him, making him ye executioner to murther ye thing he loued most dearly in yt world,  & to make hym bee punyshed afterwardes accordyng to the weightinesse of such a crime. And thys apprehension enflamed his soule with suche franticke despight, that from thenceforth hee concluded to take so cruell vengeance of himselfe, as his offence shoulde be somewhat amended thereby. Wherefore hauing his hearte fortified wyth anguishe and rage, hee withdrew him alone into a place fauorable to excute his iniust sentence, and to arme his hand with cruell impietie againste his owne hart. Alas, this desperate man would haue made all hys members reuolte (as not kuowing their maister) to conspire hys ruyne, when he aduised (by fortune) the Prince Adilon , authour of this wickednesse, who costed and watched what issue his enterprise woulde take,  & what was become of his apple, neither more or lesse, than the hunter hauing stricken his pray foloweth the tract vntill hee seeth the death therof. But thys cursed prince sought the reward of his wickednesse. For as the wilde Boare being broched throweth him selfe vppon the Hunter that gaue hym the stroke: Euen so the Lorde Alegre although he were troubled with furour and arrest of death, sawe not so soone his impoysoner, but with his sworde in his hande, he ranne swiftly vppon him. Which the traytour perceyuing, astonied with blushing visage at the iuste choler which threatned him, and conquered in conscience by his odious act, found no better weapons to defende and saue him from the daunger whervnto he felt himselfe iustly sommoned, than his heeles: wherfore casting his cloke and sword to the earth, he betooke him to flight. But he was followed so neare by the Lord Alegre , who crying with a Lyons voyce: Ah wicked traytour, hast thou giuen me the Lumbarde bitte? pursued him so swiftly, that mauger those that accompanied him for hys defence, he thrust the poynt of his sworde so farre vnder his lefte shoulder, that the heart, (I say, the heart whiche was so wicked and dissembling) beeing pearced through, yeelded the Carkase vnto death. Then all furious and madde, our Frencheman bestirred his blade here and there, sleaing and wounding the nearest vnto him, in parting the prease where it was moste thickest. Which was the cause that these miserable soules seing their maister deade, beganne to runne away without any resistaunce, so as this fencer remayned alone, who taking breath, receyued also some of his good senses, seeing him selfe halfe satisfyed of the wretche that had purchased him so great domage. Wherevpon crossing his weery armes, turning his face towards the dead body, he began to say: Oh carkasse wherin lodged a soule so vnfaithfull and deceyuable, as I hate the ayre which thou now receyuest, beeing deliuered and freed from the trauels of this life, sithence I am tormented with a thousande deathes by thy occasion, and for that euen after thy death thou makest me languishe, but I will deliuer immediatly a wished ende therevnto. This sayd, he tooke his way towards the Pallace of the Marquesse, and treading all reuerence and respect vnder foote, with a troubled countenance he went to find ye bewayled Clarinda , who in piteous lamentations (like him that vpon the Aelian mount, hauing put on the enuenomed shirte, kindled the fire wherewith he should burne him selfe) complayned not hir sorowful death, which approched very fast, but for that by a miserable aduenture he in who consisted al hir ioy, was ye cause of hir mischeefe, knowing yt his true faith hauing bin wickedly deceiued, would suffer vniust vegeace for the offence which was not his. Furthermore, for fear he should be charged enuiously after hir death of this euill fact,  & punished, all the care of this dying Princesse, was, how she might iustifie him. When amid these discourses she saw him fal at hir feete with a bloody sword, and with a constant countenance began to speak thus vnto hir: Madame, behold the sword which hath taken vengeance of the deceit of the most wicked traytor that euer the sunne viewed, who meaning to poyson me with an apple, hath done me (alas) a muche greater outrage, rendring me culpable of your greefe, wherin he hath punished me more cruelly tha he pretended: And sithence I haue made him pay for the wrong he hath done vnto me, I beseeche you Madame, take satisfaction of that which I haue committed towards you, not that by my death you shal be satisfied, for I confesse a thousand deaths wil not suffise ye same: but (alas) I haue none other thing wherwith to repaire mine offence, wherfore if you euer had desire to comfort a miserable miser, I beseech you, Madame, to discharge me of my sorowes, and my life: Then shal I be reuenged of my misfortune, which hath made me the author of my proper ruine, in making me the originall of your greefe: Yet if you esteeme me not worthy of so great goodnes, as to dye by the fauour of your hand, or if you think my sinne too heynous for so great an honor, at least, Madame, pronounce the reueging arrest of this mine offence, to the ende that putting the same in execution before your presence, your dolours may be somewhat appeased: And for gods cause, if euer pity lodged in your hart, deny me not this last fauor which I require of you, by ye seruice that my hart during life hath desired to do vnto you. Whervnto the comfortlesse Lady (who felt a fomentation ministred vnto hir sorows by the cofession of hir malefactor) assailed by paine & mercy, embrasing him straightly answered: Alas my deare friend, seeme I not euill inough intreated in your iudgemet by the rigour of my sicknesse, without your redoubling the stroke, & augmenting the wounde by your vndeserued torment? No, no friend, I dye, but I dye contented & satisfied, if you peraduenture enuy not my contentment: for if I haue any cause to accuse my destinie, which hath appoynted me this lamentable end in the first floure of my youth, I haue very wel to thank the heauens on ye other part, which haue bin so fauourable vnto me in this necessitie, as to shorten a log martyrdome by a short death, making me to receyue the remedie by him of whom I receyued my greefe. So wise Appollonius beeing asked howe a louer might be punished, answered, to suffer him to liue. Alas, sithe I am vpon the poynt to discharge mine account, the more gallauntly to passe into an other life, I confesse (mine Alegre ) that thy good graces and rare vertues had kindled in my heart a chast and honest loue, which by little and little consumed my life: but the poyson by an other contrary fire reducing me into ashes, hath had copassion (it seemeth) of my sorow. Oh is this not then a great aduauntage? wherfore good friend, I pray you,  & coniure you by the extreme affection which I haue borne you, & wil beare you eternally, if the blessed soules reioyce them in an other life of that which they haue accompted most deare in this life: and if loue remayneth not in the graue buried with the body, I pray you (I say) for my last prayer, & if I haue so great power vpon you as in times past you haue giuen me, I comaund you straitly vpon paine to be disloyal and disobedient, that from henceforth you liue happy and content: for touching mine interest, with all my heart I pardon you my death, whereof you are in no blame at all, and I consent that some more fortunate than I, may enioy the benefite due vnto me alone. Prouided that you remember I goe to attende you in a better place, sithence this worlde hath bin so contrarie to our chaste desires. And be not so hardie in the meane time to attempt any mischeefe agaynst your person, except you haue desire to violate our amitie, whiche I commit to your custodie by my Will and laste Testament. And vppon this assuraunce I goe ioyfullye to my deathe, sithence it hath bin so gracious vnto me, as to permit me the power to vtter vnto you my long adue, & happily to dye betwixt your armes. During these speeches, Loue, who in despite of death gaue his last charge, assayled on all sides the knights heart so liuely, as after it had forced him to sustayne a furious combat, made him in fine triumphe gloriously, by the victorie of his miseries. For as a small barke tossed nowe with boystrous winds, then with raging seas, after it hath runne violently a whyle in hazarde, heauing and setting amid the fomy mounting billows, with a desperate hope in fine rusheth agaynst a rocke, which breaketh and maketh wrack therof: So the sorrowful heart of the louer wounded vnto death for displeasure that he had bin the minister of hir bitter death, in whom he reposed the delight of his lyfe, and yet more violently racked with torments, hearing the piteous complaynts of his desolate Mistresse, who (as the swan at the approches of hir death, by hir dolefull tunes enforceth the neighbour shores to mourne) drewe on in the bitternesse of hir sorowes, assayled I say, with diuers contrarie apprehensions. As a Captayne rudely assaulted in diuers quarters, & destitute of all succours, in fine yeeldeth the Fortresse, whiche he hath long defended and helde: Euen so this poore Lorde was forced to yeelde vnto the excessiue power of his enemies, and to deliuer his body vnto victorious death. So as the Princesse by the scorching sighes of his lamentations bereaued vnwittingly the soule of hir Louer: so as all astonied she viewed the colde senselesse body stretching betweene hir armes, as a childe that sleepeth at the Nurses song. As the Canon whiche can not disgorge his fire, nor deliuer his bullet, whiche contende within his entrayles, is enforced to ryue and break in peeces, such was the glorious ende of our French knight, by the oppression of diuers passions which he could not disgest. Oh happy louer, who by this sweete sacrifice hast testified the hawtinesse of thy sincere affections, thy soule beeing flowen vnto the thirde heauen, may shine among theirs that haue loued moste loyally. But alas, who coulde (I saye) not expresse, but onelye thinke the dolour that the perplexed Princesse receyued, feeling at hir beautifull mouthe the coldenesse of the carcasse whiche nowe hadde paied the tribute of Nature. Alas, she remained long in a sowne, vntill at laste comming to hirselfe, she sate righte vp on the earth, where beholding wyth a passing eye the faire heade in hir lappe, whych was but a colde clodde dispoyled of his affections, she beganne to wring hir armes, and teare hir heare wrethed with pearles and pretious stones. Then after a profounde sighe shee exclaimed, O fainte and vnfortunate wretch, why hath my cruell mishap preserued me so long aliue, but only to reserue me vnto all kinds of torments? Oh mine eies muste you needes be so much mine enimies, as to beholde him deade, whose life was my soueraigne delight? Alas, that I was not borne blinde, rather than to bee so muche offended by you? And you my deare friend, my louing Alegre , floure of the noblenesse of Fraunce, ought you sithence you loued me so dearely, to take awaye this weale which I attended for my laste comforte, whiche was, to dye vppon your gratitious bosome, and that your sweete hand might close mine eies? Alas, why haue you seazed to your vse the happinesse whyche was due to me? wherfore (cruell and vnkinde) haue you chosen al the beste for your selfe, and lefte mee in this anguishe? Oh howe noughte was the mischiefe, whiche conspiring againste youre rare vertue, brought you into this Countrey, to receiue by an vngrate nation, entreatie vnworthy of youre merites? And the day which gaue you firste knowledge of me, was yet more enimy to all goodnesse, selling mine acquaintance so deare vnto you. But alas, Nature hathe so recompenced you on the other side, in yeelding you wyth priuiledge especiall power to dye at youre pleasure. Oh vniuste Death, Death, which presentest here vnto mee the markes of thy crueltie, why haste thou bin so slouthfull to succoure me? Alas, was it to render culpable of this pitious tragedie, and to defame my name towardes my posteritie? which shall euermore bewaile this floure withered for my loue, and dried by the ardure of my mishappe. Oh thrice and foure times happy, if by my death I coulde buy againe so greate a losse, (as the good Queene of Thessaly bought hir deare Admetes ) making him inheritour of life. But sithence my destiny denying me this good turne, consenteth vnto my total ruine, (hast death) I wil long be serued with this obstinate mischiefe: for euen now I feele mine end approch, to open vnto me the delicious garden of the blessed, where mine Alegre attendeth mee yet weary  & panting of his course wherin he hath ouer-run me: Who hath seene a Pigeon in Sommer bathe hir in the freshe brooke, then carying hir body by the sailes of hir spread wings, drying hir plumage glistering against the burning sun beames, vieweth the eyes of piteous Clarinda , whiche nowe bathed in bitter teares and dried againe with ardent sighes, testifyed wel that a prease of passions like bloudy bandogges deuoured hir mind, vntil yt the venime surmounting by his violence the force of nature, began to ouerthrow this beautifull building,  & kindled in ye Princesse hart a brand more burning than the perpetuall fornace of the Cicillian mountaine, wherby this voice (which had skill to charme the most rebels,) by little and little grewe feeble. The eies which like two flamed torches borrowed fro Heauen, gaue maruaile to men, leaming into their hearts by a sweete light, were dimmed with a mortal cloud: the round balls of hir cheeks, wherin roses were continually displaied: the fair forehead wheron Loue had edifyed his Paradise: the sugred mouth, and coraline lippes from whence proceeded hir gratious oracles, now wanzed to palenesse, nothing differing from the whitenesse of hir Iuorine throat, the masion of musicke. So as this body which lately before mighte worthilye bee called the Threasorie of Beauties  & the Temple of Graces, lieth waste and subuerted vnder the rigor of death, as a flowre whiche being regarded of the too scorching sunne droupeth heate and withereth vpon the branch. The which hir chambermaid perceiuing, who like a faithfull secretarie was alwaies participant of their amorous councells, in vaine labouring to remedy this piteous accident, al dismaide cried out, troubling not onely the Palaice but al the Citie, which already seemed in an vproare for the death of Prince Adilon , whiche greately amazed the Marquesse, seeing at hir retourne from Cremona (whether shee was gone for the establishment of certaine waightie affaires) this tumulte. But being arriued with speede at hir house, shee fell into a sowne betweene the Gentlemans armes that wayted vppon hir, beholding hir deare daughter (who was so renowmed throughout al Italy ) sitting against hir beds feete, hauing hir deadly lips closed vnto the mouth of the dead knight. At last being come to hir selfe, after she had bin enformed both by the Damoisell and Lucidan in person of the whole discourse of the life and death of these two louers, she could doe none other thing but with weeping and lamentation, (wherwith shee filled the Castel) solemnize the pitifull aduenture. But perswading hir minde at length there was no remedy, and that the poore bodies required nothing but the fatall bedde for perpetuall rest, she conducted them to the mortuarie of the Marquesse of Mantua , accompanied with the whole Citie, whiche in garmets  & eies testified the sorrow of the wofull harts. There they coupeled in death the creatures which in life had bin so dissolutely linked in loyal Loue, where at this day two Images remaine to view of the world, bearing the seblances, so cunningly carued in Parian Marble, as nothing wanteth but mouing to make the yet liue. True it is, to behold their sorrowful coutenances, a man wold affyrme nothing to hinder their coplaining speech, but doloure & anguish which gripeth their harts too cruelly. The knight kneeleth vppon his right knee with his naked sworde vnder his arme, the whiche beeing made of Iasper sprinkled with Uermilion spots, seemeth to be al bloudy, & hee preseteth an apple of the same stone to the Princesse (as it wer an Adam preteding to tept Eue :) the figure of Adilon (whose carcasse was caried into his countrey) standeth behind him (wt his shoulder pierced) pouring ye poyson on ye fruite. Neare vnto the louers is a piller whero stadeth Cupid , setting one foote on Fortunes head,  & treading on the head of Death wt his other foote, wt a crown on his head, wherin is writte, Victory of the vanquished , holding in his had a plate of gold wt these Romain verses.  Cor fuerat bini vnum, mens vna, viator, Quorum nunc vnus contegit ossa lapis. Thou passenger, one harte, one minde, two bodies did embrace: VVhose bones one stone is here assinde to couer in this place. This is written in Latine bycause it confoundeth other languages, and in the honoure of the Frenche tongue is written vnderneath: La pomme riche guerden De la Deesse plus belle Alluma le vif branden, Qui brul'a Troy rebelle Mais las, ceste pomme amys Seus ceste pierre polie Les Deux plus parfaitz amys De la France et de Italy .  The apple of the goddesse fair, The riche, diuine, rewarde, the liuely brond did kindle clear VVhich burnt Troy not afearde. But vnderneath this polisht stone, this fruite by fatall, chaunce, Placde two the perfectst frieds in one Of Italy and France. What thinke you (honourable audience) of these lamentable and vnfortunate Louers? Is it possible to finde more sincere and perfect affection? and yet with what greater mishappe coulde it haue bene recompenced, and that by an externall accidet, happened without fault either of the one or the other, whiche auerreth mine opinion, which was, the euill successes of Loue proceede of vncertaine hazardes, bycause the state and codition of humaine things, are such, as it behoueth necessarily to encounter therein perpetuall change from raine to faire weather, and from Sunshine to clowds, as likewise from good lucke to misfortune. So as sithence the wheele turneth continuallye, they whiche are alofte, muste make accompte to come downe. For whiche cause some Philosophers esteemed the sicke more happy than the sounde, bycause the diseased expecte health, and the helthy looke for sickenesse, which caused ye wise king of Egipt to forsake the alliaunce and confederation of Policrates the Samian King, bicause he had bin so fortunate, as for nothing he could doe he could know what sorrow was, in so much as he thought all things were ordained to content him, as witnessed the taking of ye fish, in whose belly was a ring of inestimable value, whych thys fortunate king had throwen into the sea purposely to breed him care of minde and hart sorow. And the Egiptian renounsing his amitye, yelded none other reason therfore, but that it was impossible that so great blisfulnesse should not be mixed with some horrible cursednesse, as in deede it came to passe. For ye happy king was sone after depriued of his realme and infamously hanged. Also I remember that Taramenes being at a banquet with nyne and twentye kings, the house fell downe, and with the ruyne therof slue them all but himselfe, wherby perceyuing his blessed escape, he exclaymed, Oh Iupiter , for what mischiefe preseruest thou me? Imitating thys good example, the king of Macedon neuer receyued anye good newes, but hee prayed the Gods to sende him a good market, swetening the sorowe he oughte to haue in counterchaunge, knowing that (as the wise Poet saith) Jupiter hath two vessels, the one full of goodnesse and the other ful of euill, whereout he poureth vpon mortall creatures as a king bestoweth hys larges vnto his people: but alwayes there is greater store of water than of wine. Then if it be so that we are al subiecte vnto some euil, which can not escape vs although it lingereth, (as Solon knewe righte wel, calling no man happie till after his death) and that Fortune hath suche puissaunce vppon all mundain matters, as shee nominateth hir selfe a Queene and goddesse, thinke we that hir iurisdiction extendeth not vppon Loue, sithence there is nothing so holy which she doth not violate? Not that I will in anye case agree that it resteth in hyr power to extinguishe loue, which is eternal, and freing it selfe of the mortall life, as the shining starres of Persia, Andromida, Bacchir and Ariadne do testify, with a thousande others, who for their loue do lighten the heauens, not abandoning those yt discend into hell, as the soule of amorous Polixena declareth. But this stepmother endeuoureth with hir full force, to hynder the effectes of comendable pretences, tormenting  & mangling them with miseries, as a bird whose wings are cut to depriue hir the vse of hir naturall perfection. And I dare wel say, that as the lightning beateth not but vpon the most high & haughty towers, so Fortune imployeth hir forces but against the most sincere loues, disdayning to wrastle with the weake, searching glory to ouerthrow most loftie things. But soft (said mistresse Mary ) how can you excuse the faults of men, considering by your Historie so great mischief is chaunced by reason of their iealousie. So as either you ought to accuse the simplicity of the lord Alegre , who trusted so much in Adilon as he deserued to bee deceyued, so as none but himselfe had bin endomaged, or the malice of the cruel friend, who in reuenging him vppon his enemy, caused the death of his Loue. And me thinketh, that although Loue can endure no companion, neuerthelesse if these two gentlemen had accompted the zeale of amitie of any reputation, they had giuen place the one to the other  & agreed betwene themselues, as the two Gretian princes, who in theyr loues aided ech other wt speeches, wtout loue enemy to amity, vnto who it seemeth to be brother. Whervnto Sir Bel Acoeueil replied, I confesse (mistresse) the same hath bin in time past when the world was so good as not only men surrendered their friendes to such as required them, but also their wiues, as Cato did vnto Hortensius hys enemy, who durst not demaund hir, and esteemed that all things ought to be comon among friends, except among the Scithians their sword  & glasse: but the race of these good people is dead, and there liueth none yt will imitate the greate warriour, who hauing sworne neuer to fight, bycause his king had taken his loue Brisida fro him, yet made himselfe a lyer for his friend Patroclus , shewing that amity had more force in him than loue, which causeth me (although I blame greatly the acte of Adilon ) that I should further haue blamed him if he had cowardly quitted his inquest. But I pray you Mistresse, that the grace I shew to ye princesse may suffise you, pardoning hir lightnesse in leauing an auciet seruat for a new, who was a strager  & vnknown. That which I say (answered the Damosel smiling) is not to gainesay your opinion, sithence you desire to leane to reason, amending the fault of Sir Fleur d'Amour , and yelding at this instant to Ladies the commendation which is due vnto them, by the Historie of faire Clarinda , who is not only worthy of pitty, being impoysoned by hir Louer, but bycause in hir greate tormentes in respect to be comforted with some consolation, hir eyes beheld the wofull death of him, whose life onely contented hir, whose estate I esteeme blessed, not onely for the glorie he deserueth by dying for loue, but bycause he had so good a witnesse of his sincere affection. And if to be exempt fro euil ought to be called good, I belieue this louer receiued great benefite, being exempt by his death, from the torments he should haue endured viewing the death of his Ladie. Euen so Nicocles being condemned to drinke poyson with his greate friend Phocion , requested him he might drinke firste, whiche Phocion (who neuer in his life denied him any thing) graunted at his death, although it were a thing more bitter vnto him than the very poyson. Upon these speeches the maister of the householde, by his Ladies comaundement, caused ye table to be couered for supper, where they require vs to leaue them vntyll the nexte day. The end of the third dayes sport. entred, to search and finde out the nature of all things, and that with suche diligent industrie (as some the better to atchieue the end, haue put out their own eyes) supposing thereby to adnihilate and set at libertie their profounde contemplations: Others by too hastie curiositie (like Butterflies burning their wings in the candle) haue headlong throwen them selues too too forwarde: Other some to be thought they had founde (as the Prouerbe sayth) the beane in the cake, and that they were more able than men accompted them, haue voluntarily slaine them selues: Some others, vnable to attaine vnto their pretended honour, by enraged despite, for their laste dispaire, haue taken vengeaunce on them selues by due punishment for their presumptuous enterprises. I am amazed that among all these worthy secretaries of nature (which haue not onely had knowledge of all things vsuall here beneath) but by visions and spirituall reuelation, haue knowen newes of most secret matters done in heauen, there is none to be founde which dare declare vnto vs what loue is, and what the true nature thereof maye bee: in suche sorte as if peraduenture they bee at anye tyme constrayned to entreate thereof, they passe it ouer as lightly as though they marched bare foote vpon kindled coales,  & euen that little which they speake as by acquittaunce, is more obscure than the Ephesians letters, or the wordes of Sphinx . So as they seeme to speake betweene their teeth for feare anye man shoulde vnderstande them. For one will tell you it is a sweete bitternesse, bycause menne receyue therein a thousande pleasures: another saith, it is a Court without Seriants, because they which loue obey without constraint: another calleth it a sweete tyrannie, because a Louer endureth voluntarily: another affirmeth it to be the occupation of Idlenesse, because sometime Monkes and Friers apply their mindes therevnto for feare of beeing ydle. To be shorte, euery one decketh loue in the colours they like, but none of all knoweth what they woulde saye, so as it seemeth they woulde make so great a mysterie thereof, as the tongue abashed can not expresse it, altogither vnable to signifie the same but by practise in a dumb schole, more secretely than the sacrifice of Ceres or Vesta . In effect, the wysest among all these Sages, for experience haue manyfestlye shewed themselues doctours in the arte of Loue, blaming those whose spirites be so grosse, dull, and senselesse, to lyue without loue, esteeming them as imperfect as those which were lasciuious and vnreasonable: as we repute it a vice as great to haue no taste nor any feeling of delicate daynties, as to be too gluttonous. Which was the occasion that by the lawes of Lacedemonia , suche as despised Loue were chased from publike playes, and sent vnto Forestes as bruite creatures, to be conuersaunt among sauage beastes, with Hippolitus and Menalion . So as Casimer king of Polonia (who vtterly refused mariage) and Henry the first Emperour (who hauing a fayre wife neuer touched hir but with his eye) had not bene welcome into this good Towne. But Syritha the daughter of Sinalde king of Denmark , who tooke pleasure to martyre men by the loue of hir beautie, as diuers doe at this day: or Fara Princesse of Gaule , who wept so bitterly for that she was persuaded to marrie, as she became blinde: or Amian Bishoppe of Alexandria , who put out his eyes bicause he beheld some wome wantonly: or Pope Leon , who cut off his hande wherewith he had touched a woman by too great charitie: or (to make an ende) the Byshoppe of Tholosa, Loys the sonne of Charles king of Cicill , which woulde neither see nor be seene of women (no more than Charterhouse Monkes in these dayes) saying with the great Doctour, that to viewe is not good, to speake euill, and to touche wicked. So if (saye I) that these Essenians , open enimies to women, and other superstitious Sectes, had bene iudged by good Lycargus , they had bene in daunger of the strappado at the least. Wherfore, sith loue, both by the iudgement of the most precise Philosophers, and consent of the most iust Lawmakers, is so necessarie, as without the same the worlde would perish, it is not withoute reason that oure Gentlemen and Damoysels, before they lodge suche a guest, should knowe what he is, and with what dainties he ought to be entertayned. And sith the auncientes haue made so great account thereof, that some (as the Samians ) haue erected a colledge: and others (as the Parians & Lacedemonians ) a Church separate from the temple of Venus , and with diuersitie of seruice: let vs not disdayne to dedicate a schole vnto loue in our Castle de Printemps , where like as two kniues sharpen eche other, this gallant youth by chaungeable exercise learned to whet their wittes. And sithe loue beeing a childe, requireth young Disciples, let vs not do lyke Hercules , who reserued the conquest of the Hisperian , apples for his eleuenth labour, a little before he went to Hell to binde Cerberus , which signifieth that he determined in age, and vpon the ende of his dayes to make loue. Let vs returne then vnto our yester euen lecture, and see if we can learne no newe matter of our masters: who assoone as they were risen from their beddes, began to repaire together, and dally as they were accustomed. Wherein they were so wilfully eagre, as the Lady tooke great payne, and had very much adoe to part them, and although she sent both hir men  & maydens to bring them to dinner, they could scarsly make them retire. Notwithstanding, in fine banquished by importunitie, they harkned to some truce and composition: then al breathlesse they came to their gouernesse, ashamed that they had caused hir stay the ende of their warre, and for their excuses eche one accused other. But the Lady diuiding their blame equally, said smiling: I knowe not the cause of your contention, but it muste needes be very great, sith to exercise your enmities, it maketh you forget your priuate comodities, and loue rather to fast in making war, than come to dinner in peace. Madam (answered Syr Fleur d'Amour ) the appetite of vengeace which Nature hath planted in the harts of al liuing creatures, hath had small power vpon vs: sith ye smal neede we haue to feede by reason of ye gret cheare you make vs, anayleth not to set vs at agreement: for as hunger forceth Lions and other cruell beastes to fight: contrarie, the small appetite we haue, causeth vs to quarrel. And not to spare your selfe (Madame) I dare well say, you are the cause of oure debates: for you entreate vs so well, that to get vs a stomacke we must vse this exercise. But you do rather (replied the Lady) as the wise Lidians , who hauing nothing to eate (to abridge the bitternesse of the famine which oppressed them) inuented plays, wherewith they passed the time, to deceyue their stomackes whiche barked at hunger. You saye true (Madame) replyed the Gentleman, but this, vnder your correction, doth signifie the disportes of rest, wherein there is no corporall motion, as chesplay, tables, cardes, dice, and such like: for Fencers, Dauncers, wrestlers, Hunters, and others which vse violent exercise, haue alwayes their appetite open, like the purse of a Lawier or Phisition. So the games which are played sitting, (and none other) may serue for your purpose, hauing propertie in them to alter the minde from the kitchin, to apply it selfe to the gaine of the game. Touching the matter, if you doo aske worthy Cardanus , and other Philosophers which were before him, the best meane to endure hunger very long, they will tell you the body must be restrayned and locked from labour, and not moue but very seldome. This is the cause why Maidens, whose bodies are so smoth and proper, moue nothing but their eyes, (calling the same the wise mans acte)  & eate not but their earefull. True it is, sometime we are feasted with the hearbe called Spartania , whyche causeth suche as eate thereof to faste twelue dayes after. Would God (answered the Lady smiling) that hearbe grewe in our gardayne, I assure you I had neede prouide some thereof, sith I am so vnprouided of all necessaries to entertayne you according to your desertes and my good meaning. But whatsoeuer displeasure I receyue, for that I can not perfourme my desire, I knowe it can not serue me for any sufficient excuse, vnlesse you take my good will in paiment. Now after many curtesies eche one toke their place at the table, where the mouth was more open to a thousand prety mery wordes, than to taste any delicate morsels. And after they had taken their repast, and grace sayde, they arose: then vnder the conduct of their Sibilla (which was the Lady of the place) they entred into a domesticall deserte, so well and naturally wrought, that Nature confessed hir cunning vanquished by mans industrye: For the snailes, lizardes, molles, frogs, grashoppers, shells, flints with all earthly and water beastes, fishes, and foules were preseted so liuely amidde the mossy rockes, and all kindes of plantes, trees, and hearbes, as a man woulde not onely haue thought to bee in a wildernesse of Arabia , and neare some riuer of Affrica , where all maner of lyuing things vse to drinke, but also would haue thought himselfe an Heremite, and would willingly haue vndertaken to grub the wylde rootes, and gather the fruites so naturally represented, but that they were somewhat harder, and of lesse substance, as being made but onely to feede the eye. For the so renowmed worke of the forrestrie composed by Medon , or Anet , or the so artificiall garden of Lienoour in Normandy , were not comparable to this fiction. For as I haue already saide, the enchauntresse Mellusine , who builded thys castell, employed all the Deuills, Spirites, and Fayries, moste experte in Potters crafte and caruing, aboute this worke. Now among such thinges as moste pleased my minde within the same, there was towardes the West side, (for all the place was square, and euerye quarter represented a season of the yeare) the Image of Bacchus with fat red cheekes, begrimed wyth vomets, sitting vpon the buttockes of Silenus Asse, with his face backewarde, holdyng the taile in steede of a bridle, waighted vppon throughe manye Uines, with a bande of Satires: which with their goates feete made many gamboldes. Wherof some being entangled among the twigges of the Uines, seemed to fall to the earth vpon their noses: others seemed newly risen with the beardes full of earthe: other skirmished with butterflies, others holding handes, daunced, and their song was written of Uine leaues, wyth the slime of snayles, whereof some contained par coulpets . The brooks and medows greene, VVhere auntient Nimphs their nets do laye, Full secreately vnseene. For scorching Sommer hath berefte All beautye from them both, And Zephire , hath no breathings lefte, His sighing griefes to loath. Go we, the Stockdoue to pursue, That leaues the verdant Groue, And wandereth, seeking shadows newe, VVhere vined Elmes do moue: But come companions, and beholde A hedge of grapes all blacke, Lets presse the iuyce with visage bolde, The newe wine hath good smacke. Ho Bromia , thy guilded horne VVithin my viewe doth shine, VVhiche faire garlands doth adorne Of Thirce Mysien thine: I heare thy pipe at hande reioyce, And Bacchus taber passe, Ay me, I heare the weeping voice Of olde Silenus Asse. O father with the crimsen face, Thy puissaunt force hath wonne Thy traine to be of youthfull race, Thou brother to the Sunne: In daliaunce, warre, and Louers game, Right iustie, fierce, and fine, And not as fooles do blase thy fame, A slouthfull sleepy swine. The sparkling thunder wherewithall Thy mother was exilde, Did not thy burning birth appall, Nor daintie fleshe defilde: And twice, within thy father, thou Nine months didste finishe quite, Then was, in time with dregs inough Thy rocking cradle dight. No cloth, or biggin did thee clad, Thou neuer suckedst teate, No other nurse thou neuer had, But thy full gobbelet: The often licking out whereof, From droughte did keepe thee aye, Then dauncing with the drunkerds cough On meadow softe thou laye. The ouer-bolde Penthous felte Thy puissaunt furie fell, So knewe they that in India dwelt, Thy victors arme right well. VVhere they thy fretted fleshe did see, VVhiche yoked Tygers drewe, And of greate force thy wrath to bee, Licurge did taste and viewe. VVhe thou hadst traste the world, to hel, It pleasde thee to discend, VVhere neare thy side the furies fell, Came, and to thee did bende: And Cerberus , blacke ougly hounde, All fearefull thee to see, Did licke thy tender thigh, and rounde Thy buskin, foote, and knee. Thou madste the okes sweet hony sweat And rocks with milke to floe, And fountaines run good wine and neate, Ere thou to heauen didst goe: VVhether thou leadst thy louers corps And crowned hir with starres, Thy soueraigne graces are of force To conquere cruell warres. VVithout thee nothing can be faire, Ne gentle, nor of grace: So Princelike she of louers care Approued well the cace: VVhen in a pleasante herbor greene Shee closely kissing thee, Did childe with ioy, of Gardens fine The onely deitie. O frend of Nimphs, that haut the brooks Of golden Sirens wordes, Of wandering Driades daintie lookes, O friende to pretie burdes, That pecke vppon the reasyn sweete, And hang vppon thy breaste, A frend she shews hirselfe full meete, VVhen on their scrippes you rest. Thou doste vpholde the feeble wighte, Thou counsellest the wise, Thou giuest cowardes hart to fight, The poore good hope to rise: Thou makest age againe growe young, The sadde thou makest gladde, Thou doste the face and pleasaunt tongue VVith orient crimsen cladde. Giue vs O Bacchus , sance delay, A tunne full of thy muste: So maye thy crowne of greene so gay, Be plight with flowers luste: And neuer maye the snaile haue power Vppon the same to crall, VVe will commaunde them flee thy bower, And on thy foes to fall. Meane while, we will all praises sing In honoure of thy Vine, And yeeld a recompence condigne To thee and thy workemen fine: VVith hooke and cutting kniues, we will Of grapes greate mountaines make, And in the benigne shadowe still All knobs awaye will take. This Bacchanalian song, these beautifull babes reported, with many other follies, whiche I will spare to recite, for troubling the readers eares. And to returne to our Gentlemen, whiche were rauished with so greate maruaile, as they coulde not content their eyes, so that the more they viewed, the greedier they were to beholde, vntill the Lady taking their handes, saide vnto them: Howe nowe my friendes, shall wee thus passe the daye without anye acte? but in deuising wyth these dumbe people, mee thinke wee were better, hauing founde a place of ease, to vndertake yesterdayes argument. Then euery one being sette in chaires, which seemed to bee made naturally of olde blockes of woode, and of rockes crushed togither, they chose a fresh shadowe, where was a little brooke verye pleasaunte. And renewing the piteous History of the princesse Clarinda , and hir twoo louers, they commeded the good opinion of Sire Bel Acoeuil , who attributed the misfortunes of Loue, neither to the defaulte of the Loue, (as his companion Sire Fleur d Amour hadde done) nor of the louer, (as Maistresse Mary confyrmed) but vnto the iniuries of hazardes, and humaine accidents. So as Maistresse Margaret , whose tourne seemed to summon hir to speake hir opinion, sayde: By the faith of Loue, (Syr) sith you haue beene so reasonable, as by your aduise to moderate the rigorous and infurious sentence of the wicked iudge, who hath done so muche wrong vnto women, I will not be vngratefull, but in acknowledge of youre fauoure and curtesie, I am verye well content to yelde some parte vnto menne of the due right appropriate to women. And I wyll not saye as my cosyn hathe doone, (it maye be for despighte) that the mischiefe proceedeth on the mannes behalfe, neyther of the womans parte (God forbidde:) and yet I will not bee of youre opinion. For to affirme that thys euyll happeneth by anye accidentall cause, shoulde mee thynke, depriue and deceyue mennes spirytes of wisedome and vnderstandyng, in takyng from them the power to foresee and remedye chaunces, discharged from the bowe of Fortune, whyche by myne aduice exerciseth not hir aucthoritye, but vppon suche as wante dyscreation. And sith wee all confesse hir to bee blynde, shoulde it not bee greate outrage to saye that those whome it hathe pleased perfecte nature, (whyche is God) to endue wyth reason, the cleare lighte of the soule, and wyth vnderstandyng, whiche is the eye thereof, woulde yeelde themselues to bee conducted by a blynde and senselesse guyde? Alas, I praye you, wherein shoulde menne differ from brute beastes, but bee compted muche more foolishe, seeing the mischiefe, and not auoydyng it? Wherefore to preserue the honoure as well of all humaine kynde in generall, as especiallye of suche as loue (whose violente affections, I doubte not, dothe somewhat dimme theyr vnderstandyng) mee seemeth (saue youre correction) wee shall speake more truelye, if wee doe attrybute the miseries whyche chaunce in loue vnto the malice of Enuie, whyche wyth a mortall conspiracye, dothe hande continuallye agaynste goodnesse, and hateth all thinges, as the Owle, the Flittermouse, and other vile burdes hate the faire lyghte. The whyche confessyng, wee wyll obserue by a secreate Iustice, the estate due vnto loue, placing in the number of the most excellent vertues, the whiche (and not base and vile thynges) are Subiecte to enuie: The enuye I saye, whyche as the graue Thebane Poet affyrmeth, hath alwayes beene the scourge of the good: But they are more happye than those of whome menne take pitye. Lette vs then saye for conclusion, that Enuie, whyche euermore contendeth and grudgeth againste moste hautye and glorious matters, is the mortall ennimye of Loue: who wythoute ay forbearyng, maketh in lyke manner perpetuall warre agaynste hir. The whiche I coulde easylye approue, if by youre permission I were licenced therevnto. Then the Ladye presentyng vnto hir the flowered scepter, whyche was daylye renued wyth freshe gathered nosegayes, as the olde shippe of Sasan was renued in tymes paste, and shewed as a singuler monument, bycause it was the firste of the worlde, saide; Proceede then minion, thinke to acquite youre attempte towardes this good companye, and declare some thing worthye of their hearing. Wherevnto the Damoysell aunswered, I dare not promise that, (my deare aunte) knowing, that if they haue as learned and delicate eares, (as they haue shewed to haue tongues) it shoulde altogither be impossible for me to aunswere therevnto. And if I shoulde thinke to perfourme so muche, I myghte take vppon mee, as the singers Hiarbita and Hermonyda , who wyth enforcing their noises, brake theyr wynde pipes. And I firmlye confesse, waying the difficultie wherevnto I am brought, I doubte I shall doe as Hipparchion didde, who hearing Ruffin sounde hys instrument so melodiouslye, durste not drawe hys pipes: or as the greate Aduocate of Athens , who astonied at the Maiestye of Kyng Philippe, remayned dumbe: fearyng leaste my rashenesse tourne mee to blame, syth it was so domageable vnto Marsias , who wyth hys bagpipe woulde imitate Appollos harpe: Neuerthelesse as the stroke of the spurre forceth the horse, that feareth the foule slough, to plunge throughe, so in thys my doubte the reuereuce whyche I beare vnto your commaundement (Aunte) maketh mee abandon feare, praying you to serue for my excuse, syth you haue made the matche so vnequal, as the Tortois shal sooner catche the hare in course, than I maye counteruaile the puissance, these gentlemen haue to speake well, whom I also beseeche to shew themselues fauourable vnto the equitie of my cause, and to yeelde vnto reason, rather than be affectionate to their opinion, leaste the truth lead them to suche repentaunce, as carieth with it but halfe a pardon, calling to minde, that to iudge amisse is a thing humayne, but to perseuer therein, is brutish, or (as the Theologians say) repentaunce is diuine, but arrogancie is diuelish: so as the exchange of councell hath euer bin the soueraine-remedy of error,  & as an assured port of health: the which we haue accustomed alwaies to knowe too late. So as not without cause the wise man saide, the tong must take good councell of the hart before it speake: and besides that, from a foolishe iudge proceedeth shorte sentence, it is alwayes verye difficile, for vs to gainsaye oure notified actes. The whiche notwithstanding I hope to gaine, if you will lende fauourable audience vnto an history, as true as it shall seeme strange vnto you. Then euerye one beganne to make silence, whereby the Damoisell seeing the mouth shutte, and eares open, spake thus. I know , not by what secreate iudgement the sage mother dame Nature recompenceth the defaultes, whyche are in hir creatures endowing them with sundry singular graces, whiche verye well repaireth their imperfection. Thys not onelye viewed in vnreasonable beastes: among the which, she hath furnished suche as wante their sight, wyth maruelous legeritie of hearing, and hath giuen swiftnesse, to such as are moste fearefull, subtletie to such as are most hated, & so consequently vnto al others. But this naturall equitye is principallye obserued towardes menne: the whiche, if they haue anye defaulte of one side, the other parte, they haue so greate aduauntage, as all occasion of complaynte is quite abrogated from them. So as wee see oftentimes (as Esope saide) faire heades without braines, and wisedome lodged in deformed sconces: neither more or lesse than in the likelyhoode of apples (sayde Socrates ) of whiche the most counterfaite are the best. Wee see, I saye, oftentimes the riche ignoraunt and euill disposed, and the poore vertuous. But aboue al, this liberall recompence of nature shineth in bastards and stollen children (as men call them, which is to say made by stealth) the which disauowed of a father their chiefe support and stay, haue commonly so great subtiltie and gallantnesse of spirite, as they marche without a staffe, and aduaunce themselues by their owne industrie vnto most mightie and honourable estates. Nowe touching the same I will not studie greatly to searche out the cause, for so muche as it hath bin discoursed by sundrie volumes: But if you doubt thereof histories and fables with one voyce are witnes of my saying, beeing all repleate with the noble actes of Bastards, whiche haue rendered their fames so admirable, as their posterities in respect of obloquie agaynst the children of harlots, haue nominated them the ofspring of the Gods, neuer attributing suche honour but vnto kings. Nowe among the most braue and excellent Bastardes that euer were, we ought of good right to enroll him, of whose piteous ende we will entreate, after he had liued so godly, valiauntlye, and fortunatelye. As (whatsoeuer the Monkes of Saint Geneuiefue report, with whom he played horsplay) he deserued well to be placed in the ranke of most splendant Princes. He of whom I make report (honorable company) was called William the Bastard. And you shall vnderstande, that about fiue hundred and fiue and twentie yeres, there reigned in Fraunce a good Prince, iust and valiaunt, named Henry , who had great warres to mainteine his estate, agaynst certayne Rebels, as one Thibalde Earle of Charters , and of Tours, Estienne Earle of Champaigne , and others. But in all his aduersities he experimented a faithfull amitie in Robert Duke of Normandy . Who likewise had suche affiaunce in the King (whom he had bounde by an infinite number of good seruices) as going on pilgrimage to Ierusalem (where he dyed, surmounted by the trauayle of the tedious iourney too intollerable for his feeble agednesse) he commended to his seruice and care, William his bastarde sonne. And the good man was nothing deceyued in his credite: for Henry notwithstanding the force of the legitimate kinred of Robert his deceased friende, put this bastarde in possession of the Duchie. Who (as he was borne  & vowed to great enterprises) had fortune so fauourable vnto his noble vertue, as not content with Normandie, the Sea could not hinder him to enlarge his limittes, and conquere the Realme of England, chasing king Harolde out of the same, and married a fayre Lady, who brought warres both into and without his Realme, the which he extinguished by his voluntarie death, leauing foure male children, Robert who enioyed the Dukedome of Normandie, Richarde who dyed in the flower of his age, William surnamed Rufus, and Henry, who succeeded him, and were kings of Englande, the one after the other. Nowe beeing of a Duke become a King, although he were endued with so great vertue, as he deserued commendation from the most barbarous, yet woulde he shewe himselfe vnto his subiectes worthy to commaunde them, contending to please both their spirites and eyes, whervpon he determined at his entrie into London, the capitall Citie of his Realme to vse suche magnificence as apperteyned to his dignitie, and sent Embassadours with presentes and letters into the Courtes of all Kings with whom he was in league of amitie, aduertising them thereby of the good successe of his hawtie enterprises. In gratulation whereof, and in some honourable testimonie of their amitie and brotherhood, the moste parte of those Kings sent their Princes, that by their ayde they mighte fauour the possession of this newe raigne: the whiche were all entertayned as their noblenesse deserued. The appoynted day beeing expired, which was the fifteenth daye of Aprill, the King commaunded the games ordayned for the solemnitie and magnificence to beginne: In so muche as all the Isle was replete with myrth and brauery, and euery thing diligently prepared for the execution thereof, and euery man contended to make the moste gallant shewe. And the pompe was so great that it was impossible to wishe any more. The combattes of all maner of beasts both by lande and water wanted not, Iustes, Turneys, counterfaite skirmyshes, wrestlings, Maskes, Uaulting, Tumbling, stage playes, bonde fyers, and other gallyardizes, were ordinary. And for this effect, the king commaunded to buylde a sumptuous Amphitheatre, according the plat of Nismes , where at euery exercise which was doone, he shewed him selfe so actiue, as there was no straunge Prince, but muche commended his wonderfull dexteritie. Nowe it happened on a daye of Turney, the King beeing within the listes very glorious, because he had broken so many launces, the Marques of Lubecke , a valiaunt and hardie knight, whom the king of Denmarke had sent to present his person in magnificent assembly, presented him selfe before the kinges parte, whose vertue he esteemed aboue the residue of the Princes, as wel experimented by due proof of his valure, notified in the honour of his king and countrey. This Marques had paynted in his shielde the picture of his Lady, so perfect and accomplished in beautie, as it seemed very well to be counterfayted at pleasure in commendation of the Painter, for that Nature was too feeble to frame suche a creature. Nowe the king seeing this knighte, whiche by his countenaunce promised some noble acte, had greate desire to proue his valure. Wherefore choosing a mightie Launce, after the accustomed defiaunce, the Trumpettes sounded: at whose warning the two Champions beganne liuely to strike with spurres, and buckeled to their shieldes, couched their staues with great furie. When the King (the more firmely to taynt had lefte hys Beuer alofte) aduising hys man from farre; behelde in hys shielde wherewith he was couered, the figure of hir vncomparable beautie, whiche he vewed so stedfastly, as for feare to deface a thing so precious; when he came to the ioyning he raysed his Launce. And the knight who had neuer learned to strike at aduauntage, or conquere without resistaunce, dyd the lyke, whiche caused the whole multitude beholdyng thys braue blowe to laughe: and the king him selfe turning towardes his aduersarie, sayd: Uery well syr knight, at what game play we? it seemeth we feare one another. Nay rather Syr (answered the Marquise) sauing my reuerence vnto your Maiestie, it seemeth we feare not much one another, but that we will finde a newe maner of combat, that is to say, with the shadowes of our Launces. But for my parte, I had rather be vanquished hande to hand, by him which accustomably conquereth all than to be thus forborne, wherein me thinke Syr, you litle esteeme me. I haue (sayd the king) good occasion to esteeme you otherwise than you say: but sith you take it so, I will tell you the cause, to the ende your harte may be quiet and satisfied. You shall vnderstand, Syr knight, that your braue demeanure gaue me great desire to proue you: but the honour which I beare vnto beautie, made me (beeing minded to entreate you euill) to hazarde my person to sustaine the efficacie of your prowesse, determining to mine own domage to warrant this faire image which so much honoureth your sheelde. Wherevnto the knight answered, By the faith I owe to armes, Syr, you shewe right wel there harboreth in you as great courtesie as valiauntnesse, the happie renowne whereof maketh you so well knowne in all places. And for the desire I haue of the honour to skirmishe with you, I wishe I had possessed other armour, sith as suche whereby I seeke fauour, hath made me loose this oportunitie and aduauntage, and in respect to make me vanquished by your valure, haue yeelded me conquered by your grace and fauour. And although this vertue (as all others) are naturall and familiar vnto you, so it is that the courtesie which you haue vsed at this present, is not euill employed. But, O God, what woulde you haue done to the body, sith you so louingly beholde the dead shadowe in a table? for you shall vnderstande, Syr, that the Lady whose figure I beare, hath bene no lesse fauoured of nature, who hath endued hir with so many graces as hir like may hardly be founde, than of fortune whiche from hir birth hath rendred hir inheritter of two Realmes. And knowe you Syr, that you see heere the counterfaite of the Princesse of Denmarke and Zeland , vnder whose fauour I purpose to beare armes, vntil she haue founde a seruaunte worthye of hir deserte, who maye acquite his duetie better than I. Whervnto the king, feeling a newe fire kindled within him, saide: By the fayth of a Prince I doubt not, but vnder the fauour of so perfect a creature, a man might conquere the whole worlde. And I dare boldely maintaine there is no Prince, that hath greater desire to serue hir than my selfe, nor that better deserueth hir loue, hauing neuer bene vanquished but by hir alone: whiche causeth (and I pray you to excuse my loue) that I beare so small desire vnto the glorious defence which you haue enterprised for hir loue. True it is, that whiche moueth me more paciently to support this greefe is, that this you doe, proceedeth of the naturall seruice which you owe vnto hir noble estate, as a subiect and not as a friende. Which giueth me hope (sayde the king returning towarde his supper which then was prepared) that you will not in any wise cause any hinderace vnto me in this amorous purchase, but rather I expecte your intire assistaunce therein. At these speeches proceeding from affection which could not be concealed, the Marques wonderfully well pleased, bothe with the honour he receyued by this secret talke with the king, and for the good successe of a matter vnexpected, which by this good hap gaue him entrye to greate aduauntages, for the good whiche might chaunce vnto the Realme of Denmarke by meanes of suche alliaunce, whereof he shoulde be the motion and author, embracing the kinges thighe, sayde: Syr, for so muche as I esteeme my selfe very fortuuate of the good happe, whiche by thys occasion I maye procure vnto twoo so noble Realmes. as Englande and Denmarke, I shoulde be so muche more sorrowfull and displeased, and woulde my life muche harme, if herein I coulde nothing profite nor serue. But if a man may assure him selfe of worldly casualties, I make full account to aduaunce a happie ende to your desires and my duetie, sith your Royall intent is suche: for if euer my Princesse consent to mariage, it is more than certayne, that aswell for the cleare renowne of your vertues, as in respect of my faythfull report, you shall obtayne the onely place in hir tender harte: and thervpon I dare gage my heade. The king as muche contented as might be possibly imagined, after he had embraced the Marquise, thanked him affectuously for this good offer, praying him to haue it in remembraunce. And the better to execute the same, he gaue him a Dagger after the maner of the Countrey, of inestimable value, for the handle thereof was of a Crysolyte, and the pomell of a fine Rubie. Then turning him towardes the Princes and straunge Lordes, he receyued them very magnificently, and in acknowledge of the honour they had done him in this assemblie, he bestowed great gyftes, and honoured them with his order. Then after they woulde returne, he made them all to be honorably conducted to the Sea. But aboue the rest, the Marquise of Lubecke receyued testimonies not onely of a Royall magnificence, but also of a singular fauour and amitie: whom the king prayed to present his most affectionate commendations vnto the good grace of his Maistresse, with a Nosegay made of precious stones, so liuely sette in Goldesmithes worke, as they were to be iudged freshe gathered flowers, and a Letter therewith, the contentes whereof ensueth. Madame , when I consider what is happened vnto me by your meanes, I knowe not if I ought to thanke you for the honour it hath pleased you to do me, by the diligent dutie of your seruaunt the Marquise, or rather blame you for the euill which without desert I haue so gently purchased: yeelding me (so muche the vertue of your face extended from farre) to resemble some image: not by the aspecte of a Gorgon, but by the sight of an enchauntiue beautie, the which hath so ouermastered me, as of a conquerer of others, it hath rendered me hir vanquished. Alas, if Mars had then had as muche puissaunce as Venus , I had all armed repulsed the violence whiche this hidden enimie hath vsed towardes me, or by force of armes, I had atchieued a happie victorie: where as nowe, a fyre is kindled in me by a viewe so domageable, as it will neuer be quenched, but more and more encreasing, will consume me, if I be not comforted by some assured testimonie of your good grace, whose onely shadowe printed in this table, hath brought me so greate care, as I hope to receyue of ioye (for recompence) in their proper subiecte. Whiche shall be then, when to burne more feruently I shall approche this heauenly fyre, which shineth in your beautifull eyes, the delectable attainte whereof shall fade no more in my harte, than the flowers assembled in thys Nosegay, the whyche (kyssing the handes of your excellencie, for gage of his amorous affection) I sende vnto you. He whiche is bereeued of him selfe, to become intierly yours, William king of Englande . With these Letters closed and sealed with the Royall signet, the Marques sette sayle, hauing assuraunce from the King, that assoone as he had called a Parliament for the reformation of his Realme, he woulde dispatche Embassadours to entreate this noble Mariage: perswading him selfe righte well, that the King woulde delaye no tyme, considering in what temper he had lefte hym, nor forslowe thys newe loue (whiche carryed meate in the mouth) as hys carefulnesse verye well testified whiche had abandoned hys lybertie and lustinesse: So as all hys delighte was to withdrawe him selfe into his solitarie Closet to nourishe his affections, in admiration of the graces and perfections wherewith his newe Maistresse enriched the shielde whiche the Marquise had committed to his custodie. The whiche as he helde on a day betweene his handes, after he had attentiuely viewed and kissed it, discharging a profounde sighe, he beganne to say: Alas, what puissance hath beautie, sith that a senselesse Picture making vs vnsensible like it selfe, rendreth men so muche more subiect to seruitude as they be noble and high minded. But whence procedeth it, that mine vntamed courage is so soone yelded captiue without any enforcement? O howe vnaduised was I, when by fantasie to a vayne picture, I forsooke the pursuite of the glorie I had atchieued at the Iustes: and yet was I more mad, so muche to cherish and honour the same, by meanes wherof I receyued so great domage, and whereby I entred into such folly as welneare purchased my death. Alas, men say in times past the poore she Goate suckled the wolues whelp, which when he grew great, deuoured his nurse. And that a miserable Labourer for pitie warmed in his bosome a Serpent, which he found almost frozen to death, who beeing reuiued, slewe the author of his life. But alas, in my blinde miserie I am much more witlesse, for the Goate & the husbandman receyued euill after they had done good, wherein they are the more to be excused: But I haue done good after my receyued harme, which I had not done, at least if I had beene wyse, lyke the Brytons, after the receyte of the stroke. Ah vnhappie Painter, whiche with thy pensell, enemie to mans libertie, haste so courteously heaped together like a treasure, all requisite perfections to force the most rebellious, and torment the moste pacient. Alas wherfore haste thou hidden, I knowe not what vnder the cloudes of these liuely colours, which not content to dasell the corporall eyes, penetrateth as the sunne beames passing through a glasse window, euen vnto the most secrete of the minde? the which it charmeth in such sort as it is forced to consent vnto hir proper ruine: whereof I can make good reckening beeing brought into so piteous estate as sorowe is my customable meate, and mine eyes haue no leysure to sleepe, they are so turmoyled in continual teares. Then turning from the one side to the other, he chaunged with the mouing of the body from one passion into another, and reprouing him selfe he sayde: Alas caytife wretche, wherefore blame I the Painter, who hath cunningly shewed the excellencie of his arte in this principall peece of workemanship? Or why entertaine I the thing which from farre hath deliuered me so great torment, wherevnto the rigour of my infallible destenie hath allotted me? Ah Marques, thou Marques (who as a fourltier hast marked me the lodging of loue) howe well serued thy shielde, by the whiche without anye stroke striken, thou haste vanquished me. As Roger was accustomed to conquere by the enchaunted shielde, whiche hys maister Atlas made for him. Thus the desolate prince complayned his libertie loste throughe the force of a newe conquerour: when as, after a long silence, recounting the whole discourse of thys businesse, being by little and little come to himselfe. But what (saide hee) foole and madde manne that I am: wherefore rebell I against my selfe misconstruing my good happe? Ah, ha, how well know I to my coste, that as things most sencible dulleth the senses, euen so moste fauorable fortune troubleth the minde, and yeldes thereto suche miscontentment, as it cannot endure the great goodnesse, whiche presenteth it selfe. Ah, I were verye blinde, if I perceyued not nowe in my selfe, hauing receyued so great fauour from heauen, to bee predestined by a strange and miraculous meanes, vnto so greate good happe, as may bee possibly wished? neuerthelesse impatient of my good houre, I tormente my selfe withoute reason. Oh blessed arriuall of the knight, who by heauenly prouidence, hath procured so commodious a match for me, O fortunate daye, whiche made me partaker of an vnexpected profite and moste happy: yet the industrious hand, which giuing mee knowlege of so singuler a beautie, hathe serued for a spokesman and furtherer to performe the vnion of an alliaunce so to be wished. Alas, what Venus of Appelles may be compared to thy worke (gentle Painter) whiche hath had puissance to gaine the hart of a king? wherin thou hast done more than greate Praxitellus , who constrained a young infante, to come by night to embrace his Image of Venus Guydina , or those, who by a grauen stone, caused Alcide to become lunatike and dye for the loue of the Image of Thespiada , and assotted Pilat at Corinth with the ardent loue of an Helene of cold marble: yea and more than Pigmaleon , who became amorous of the Alabasters Image (with his owne handes carued) for thou hast rendred me amorous of a person, whome a mightie sea interposite, hindreth me to loue? Notwithstanding the sages teach vs, we muste not rashly credite euerye worde, howe muche lesse euerye painting? Sith that painters are in possession, time oute of mind, of libertie to frame al shapes at plesure according to their fantasie. And what know I, whether thys table wer framed by exquisite workmaship or not, by some such as thought therby to gaine commendation  & be famous, as we know there hath bin euer contention & striuing for honor? Thus being so well made, what woman liuing wil not easyly aduouch it for hir semblace? And is it not very easie, to make it passe for ye couterfeite of such as men wil, in place where few people can gainesay it? But yet put case this table be made to the true similitude and likenesse of the princesse of Denmarke: is it not the custome of painters (especially when they draw great personages, whome al men will please) to forget nothing whiche may augment the beautie, and amend euery imperfection, so as oftentimes they greatly shame Nature. Tush, put yet the case that shee be in all respectes suche without any addition of ye flattering painter, that is not all: for the principall part is yet to discipher: for painters in represeting the features and corporall, liniaments cannot unitate, neyther subiect vnto their pensell, the fashions, graces, maners, & spiritual complexios, which either laudable or vitious do cleare or darken beautie: and yet are these moste requisite things. For the giftes of nature perishe sodainely (as a floure which hath but a mornings life:) but the vertues of the mind, render themselues victorious vpon age, & triumph ouer time. But men view aswel vntoward dispositions, as beautiful bodies. So that as Apoticaries put not the beste drugs in the faireste boxes, so God planteth not vertues in the moste fairest bodies. But what? where should vertues rest, but in princes so well nourtured? no, not so, vertue maketh no such accompt of sumptuous pallaices, as shee consenteth to forsake the Mansion of the rurall mountayne, and the courte was neuer a schoole of wisedome. Neuerthelesse (whatsoeuer it bee) syth there is question of marriage, whiche is the greatest hazarde of oure lyfe, wee muste not throwe oure selues blinde-fielde therevnto, as the Andabates doe to fighte, for feare wedlocke leape into the saddle, and repentaunce on the crouper. And mee thynketh some Princes euill aduised as in a case of so greate importaunce, wherein their entire weale or woe consysteth, committe the intreatie and conclusion thereof to Ambassages and Legates, as for mee I wyll truste none, but my selfe. Thus thys poore Prince, after hee hadde profoundelye debated hymselfe (as the wilde beare, which after long huntyng is constrained to throwe hymselfe into the toiles) resolued to vnderstande more of thys newe enterprise: for the better execution whereof, hee determined to transporte hymselfe into Denmarke in disguysed habite, aduertising the Lordes of Englande, thath passed the Seas into those partes, to gyue orders in the gouernement of hys Dutchye of Normandy . So hauyng assembled the whole Councell, hee constituted sundrye gouernoures in seuerall Prouinces, whome hee honoured wyth manye goodly estates, meanyng to content euerye one, if it hadde beene possible. But it is no meruayle thoughe hee failed therof, what paine soeuer hee tooke: first he committed the gouernement of the North parts ioyning to the riuer of Twede , and Ganaforde , vnto the Duke of Gloucester, and the Earle of Bedforde: And made the Duke of Lancaster, who was enimye vnto them, deputie of Irelande, by the whyche deede, hee sturred theyr ambitious myndes vnto so greate miscontentment, as hadde not the Duke of Somerset, and the Earle of Northumberlande stayed theyr malice, they hadde vomited their raging furie to the greate charge and disaduauntage of the king, whome they thoughte had made euill diuision of these estates and honoures. So as the poore Kyng, loste hys good entente, as you shall vnderstande. Nowe wente hee on hys iorney, thinkyng hee hadde lefte all things in suretie, guyded by impatient loue, (whyche beeyng blinde) hindered hym to see what follye it was so fondely to leaue hys Realme newely gotten in praye to others, wherein hee established the Duke of Diort and the Earle Dunaruch , bothe Normaines, gouernoures in all soueraintie, during hys absence. And tooke wyth hym for companions of hys voyage, the Prince of Wales, the duke of Clarence, the Earle of Arundell, and the Erle of Hertforde. ye which being al arriued in Normandy , knew the enterprise of ye king, and not before, the whiche euery one allowed, esteemyng themselues happy to be elected for so agreeable seruice, wherein each one determined to employ his diligence. But the Kyng willed the Prince of Wales to remayne there his Lieuetenat, vnto whome hauing giuen the ring of his priuie signet (wherewith he touched his mouth before he would put it on his finger, to teach him to conceale the whole acte) he departed with the other Lords without any sound of Trumpet. Nowe our Marriners Pilgrimes, searching new lands vnder the eleuation of Venus , whiche was their lodesterre, were fauoured with so prosperous windes, as in lesse than two dayes they discouered Calleis , where hauing taken land, they determined to finishe the voyage on Horsebacke, as well for the disposition of their bodyes, as to see the Countrey, leauing notwithstanding Captayne Grecy and Matago aboorde, to conduct the shippe, who shortly ariued in Ireland , neere vnto a small Promontory, where the riuer of Alba entreth into the Septemtronall Sea. Thus the Princes sporting and deuising by the way, approched the Countrey of Arden , whereof they had heard so great reporte, and there vpon the top of a little hill, they founde the famous fountaynes, whiche will they, nill they, inuite the passengers to drinke, engendryng in them the one loue, and the other hate, sure with such alteration, as it is vnpossible euer to extinguish their forces, wherof by a wanton curiositie the King woulde drinke, and the worst was, that he pleased to tast of the one and the other, the which turned him to great domage as you shall vnderstande, for thereof proceeded dislike of the Princesse of Denmarke , who certaine dayes before passing that way, hadde dronke onely of the fountayne of loue. From thence our English Pilgrimes arriued at Claiburge , whereas the Court then lay, and according to their dutie, went to doe theyr reuerence to the King, who vnderstanding they were Englishe Gentlemen, come to see the Countreys, receyued them verye honourably, and enterteyned them with particular embracings, and in fauour of the message whiche the Marques hadde reported vnto him according to his charge as you haue hearde: And forthwith presented them vnto the Princesse Amire his daughter. Then oure Englishe King (who seemed wel to be thee principall of the troupe, for his braue countenaunce, whiche he coulde not dissemble by any counterfaite semblante) stepped forth, and after he hadde kissed hir hande, he saide: Madam, when my companions, and I my selfe lefte oure country, and all oure commodities, with great trauailes to visite strange landes, our intent and desire was chiefly to see and learne wyth some paine, something to make vs the wiser, and wherewyth wee might purchase contentment. But we durste not once hope to encounter so great fauour, as to see your excellencie, which is a commoditie, that sufficiently recompenceth the log trauailes, which our iourney hath caused vs to endure: For althoughe the renoume of youre perfection hath astonied the whole world, and the onelye counterfaite of the same, at thys daye kindled a flame in the harte of oure king, whiche shineth ouer all Englande: so it is, that I knowe well, and am constrained to confesse, that the tongue and the hand of man, are too feeble for so worthie a subiect. So as enforcing themselues to doe their endeuoure, they doe you greate wrong, making of an Elephant, a mouse. And sith you giue mee licence, by your curteous audience to speake the truth, I maye assure you (Madam) that if the diuine wisedome of the mightie king of Iuda , caused the Queene of Saba to leaue hir countrey, certainely youre excellentnesse ought iustly to inuite the kings, whiche inhabite the vttermoste parts of the worlde to repaire hither to meruaile thereat. Truly Sir Knight (aunswered the princesse blushing with roseall shame) whyche beautified hir naturall white, and casting downward hir shamefaste eyes, it seemeth to heare you speake, that you neuer sawe but mosters, which maketh you to meruaile at them which are somewhat more naturall, and whiche at the leaste affray not their beholders, or else you woulde shewe howe the English nation among other commendable things, whiche they vse, are plentiful in praises and haue a grace to make great accompt of that which is of no valure: but to giue you a more ample occasion to saye well, I pray you, that euen as you vndertoke youre voiage (as you say) to breede you some profit yt you wil vouchsafe thereby that to profit vs also, (in learnyng vs after you haue take your case) that which wee know not, touchyng the estate of the famous florishyng Isle of England, beginnyng at the Kyng therof. Then the Knight of Meffy , (for so the king would be called at his departure out of Normandy ) the better to atchieue his amorous conquest, comaunded himselfe to discouer what fauor and credite hee had towardes the Maiestie of his King, so farre forth as to be admitted vnto the secreates of his priuie affaires: especiallye howe hee hadde seene in the Kynges closet a shielde, wherin the Princesse figure was, as I know very well in viewing you, Madam (saide hee:) and that hee hade bin participant of manye sighes, which testifyed righte well, that she was not lesse engraued in hys hearte, than in the table: so this good Preacher forgatte nothing whiche hee thoughte myghte serue to put fire to the tapers. And I leaue to your thought, if the yog princesse eares molested hir not, whiche alreadye was amorous by fantasie: Well, I can assure you, that faining she coulde not wel vnderstand the gentlemans talke, for the diuersitie of the tongue and straunge pronounciation, she made him repeate one thyng oftentimes: so as this Pilgrims caused the Ladies spirytes to make a Pilgrimage into Englande, to searche farre off that whyche she had so neare hir. And by these pleasaunt wordes, he suckeled the yong loue whiche the Marquesse had already made hir conceiue in hir teder hart. But to tel you ye truth, he had sure made another snare if the water of the fountaine of Ardeine had not hindred him, which by a secreate operation had engendred an enforced enmitie, without any occasion whervpon to ground the same, so as all that the Knight of Meffy saide, was but to acquite hym of the Princesse demaunds, to beginne to practise his newe enmitie, in rendering hir passioned of a thing so farre oute of hir power: which is one of the moste extreame mischiefes. Alas, what force is there in inchauntments and poysons? but principallye when they are made by drinkes? whiche maketh mee almoste beleeue that which men speake of this fountayne, whose water dieth heare yellowe, or of the fountayne whyche causeth a man for euer to hate wine, or of that which maketh al such drunken yt taste therof, or of that wherin woode being caste, doth kindle like a flame, or of that which chaungeth all thinges into stone (yea euen the entrailes of any that drinketh therof, indurate lyke flinte) or euen of that which transformeth men into women,  & women into men, if they bathe therein. Nowe if these fountaines transforme and change the body so miraculouslye, wherefore do we finde it strange, that those of the forreste of Ardeine doe alter the spirytes? as the water of Ethiopia dydde, wherof suche as drunke, became madde. Nowe thys poore louer experimented right wel thys force of the charmed water, whom being come so farre, hauing committed hys estate and person vnto so great daunger, for the loue of the Princesse Amire , and after louing hir so well hauing neuer seene hir: nowe he viewed hir, hee hated hir to the death, and I know not wherefore. But whatsoeuer greate perfections he marked in hir, he could not refraine to hate hir, whereof despighted and willing greate mischiefe to himselfe, he knew not whervpon it sprong, neyther of whome to demaunde reason, but of his owne lightnesse. And vpon these alterations, the tables were couered for supper, where the Prince of Westphalia was, who delyuered the Knight of Meffie of a more greater griefe than any man wiste: for beeing set ouer againste the Princesse Amire , in respecte of hys dignitie, whiche hee helde among the highest estates, he made our Englishemen to giue place, who perceyuing the Marquesse of Lubecke enter into the Hall, ran to embrace hym, vnto whome the king said in his eare: brother I pray you aboue al pleasures of the worlde, tel no man what I am, but name me the knight of Meffie : The whiche he promised him, and performed very well. (But alas it was to his domage, as wee shal perceiue hereafter:) Neuerthelesse (so long as dissimulation woulde suffer) hee ceased not to vse hym wyth al curtesie conuenient to hys highenesse: which caused al others to be the more induced to honoure these stragers. During the supper, yt disguised knight behelde wt so stedfast eie a damoisell, which sate face to face against him, as shee seemed rather some Angelet made by God miraculouslye, than a maiden borne of any mortall woman, who fed hys languishing spirites, of a meate whiche was very vneasie vnto hym to disgeste. And after he had sucked (with his gluttonous eies,) the sweete venyme, whyche distilled from thys beautie, which by hir presence darkened the graces of the Princesse Amire , (as the sun rising maketh vs lose the sight of the starres, yea and dimmeth the Moone it selfe) hee was vnquiet in minde till after supper, that he might learne to knowe what shee was, that so sodainlye had stolne him from himselfe, to imprison him vnder the yoke of hir good graces, imitatyng the disease of the dropsie, who no sooner tasteth of water, but he dieth with desire of drowning. Alas, if the butterflie were content to viewe from far the brightnesse of the candle, hee shoulde not feele howe domageable were the approche therevnto, so this prince, if he had bin contented wyth the only sight of this Damoisell, he had not proceeded from euill to worse. For being staied by the knight, she (whiche was aswel brought vp as the beste) knewe to entertaine him so curteouslye as she by hir modeste behauioure, adorned with such beauty, as beseemed al the rest, gained the true place wherof the onely picture of hir Maistresse had possession not long before. Oh howe meruellous and straunge is the power of loue? who subiecteth men in suche sorte vnto his wauering will, as the softe waxe is not more easyly wrought and conuerted into such shapes as the worker pleaseth, than their hartes disposed vnto chaunge, according to the fantasie of his foolish puissance: which now disporteth himselfe with this poore knight, hauing quite defaced ye first loue which seemed so violent, and renewed by a secreate fantasie, another fire more hotte, for the seconde loue extinguished the first, as the approch of the sun consumeth the morning deaw. Wherby this prince ordained by destiny to loue, after he was bathed in the meruailes of so beautiful a subiect, he felte himselfe rapte into the thirde heauen, where loue lodgeth, and thought he wandered in the Paradise of beautie, sith that he had found the goddesse thereof. Hee sounded beholding hir hear, hir foreheade, hir mouth and hir bosome, but he died when she spake, when shee smiled when hir glyding eye glaunced towardes hym, or when hir white hande delyuered anye gestures, (so daungerous is a repulse in this maladie of loue. Alas, whilest the sounde of diuers instrumentes disposed eche one vnto iollity and liuelinesse, the Knight alone remayned sadde and pensiue, holding his new mistresse by the hande, who with hir beautifull eyes entangled his toung, vntill that beeing ashamed of his shamefastnesse, after sufficient ayde receyued by his eye, he brake the dumbe prison of this base bashfulnesse, and knowing that a greefe, the longer it is concealed, the elder it groweth, and the elder it is, the lesse curable, he layde open his passion vnto hir, thereby to receyue the desyred remedie. And with a lowe voyce he began to say: Madame, when nature framed the creatures which we viewe vpon earth, she planted in the voyce of one and other a lawe, howe to complayne beeing greeued, and gaue them a secrete inclination to searche succour  & remedie with their whole endeuour: So as it may easily be noted, she hath learned them a voyce to mourne, other than that wherwith they reioyce, and hath in suche wise taught them the meane to heale themselues, as there is not almost any among them but knoweth and seeketh a proper Hearbe to salue his sore. But with more forcible reason, man beeing the principall worke, and eldest sonne of Nature, ought for the merite of his reason, to participate with aduauntage this naturall communitie. Wherefore (Madame) it ought not to seeme strange vnto you, if beeing greeuously wounded (yea almost euen vnto death, through the efficacie of the perfections, whereof the heauens, enemie to my good happe, hath bene too prodigall towards you, I am constrayned for my laste remedie to vse their meane which are stoong of the Scorpion, who recouer and seeke medicine from whence they haue receyued their hurt, knowing you are she alone which may heale the wounde whiche your selfe hath geuen me. But if Nature enraged agaynst men, had grafted in your delicate brest a hart of yron to destroy them, tempering secrete rigour with so apparant mildnesse. I haue iustly whereof to complayne me of my cruell aduenture, which depriuing me of all quiet and ease, hath conducted me with so great trauaile into a countrey where Basiliskes are transformed into Damoysels, the more easily to slay straungers with their eyes: or I may well say, this is the Isle of Circes , wherein trauaylers are retayned in tyrannicall seruitude, hauing lost the first forme of their creation. And me thinketh the king of this Countrey is well aduised to sende the picture of his daughter through the worlde, for if the least of your perfections might any wayes appeare in painting in farre Countreys, I knowe no Prince but woulde come with force of armes into this Realme, not to enioye it, but for the gayne of your good graces, by a conquest more glorious than that of the so renowned Fleece of golde. The whiche, if they maye be obtayned by an amorous seruice, and not by an armed campe, my care hath whereof to receyue comfort by a faythfull hope, that I maye deserue so great good happe to loue you more than may suffice any poore harte, whereof I will geue you sufficient proofe, if time be fauourable to my desires. In the meane time I beseeche you (Madame) take pitie of him whiche attendeth life or death of your yea or nay, otherwise you can not be long cruell vnto me, for the greefe is too violent to make me languishe long time. Nowe although this tale nothing displeased this yong Damoysell, for it contenteth them all to be praysed, (as it is not difficult to make Maydens beleeue they are fayre, principally when the faythfull counsell of their looking glasse gaynesayeth it not) yet as Nature hath taught the wysest sufficiently to disguyse their grace, in counterfayting the person, whose parte they must play, this gentle Ladye, who was no prentise in suche practises, as also for that hir wit was too good and well prouided to leaue hir toung vnprouided of answere, armed hir eyes with so sharpe and trenchaunt regardes, as if pearced euen the centure of the passionate Louers hearte. Then with a Syrly browe, accompanied with a braue smyling, she sayde vnto him: Iesu Gentleman, haue you in so short tyme founde in me the thing whiche enhardeneth you to vse suche speache vnto me? I suppose you iudge you dalie now with some simple Mayde, who by hir light beleefe shoulde giue credite to a mocke, pursuing (I neede not saye) a scoffer, as they are, who haue seene so many Countries) to atchieue the ende of their fonde desires by the flattery of your fayre wordes, wherof you all make your prouision. Ah, you haue a little mistaken your marke, but you knowe me not, and therefore I will excuse you, vpon condition of repentaunce: for you muste thinke that although God hathe greatlye abased me, he hath notwithstanding placed mine honor in so sure groud, that Fortune who can chaunge the conditions, and not the vertuous affections, hath not had, nor neuer shall haue so great victorie, as to make me consent vnto the losse of that which is of greatest estimation vnto me. I say not (Syr knight) but there is sufficiencie in you, whereby to seduce an innocent Uirgin: but surely the birde is vneasie to take whiche discouereth the Nettes. I aduise you therefore to accept this for a resolute answere: bestirre you for catching of cold, and from hencefoorth lose no more labour, nor tryfle away no more time: for when the bow-string breaketh, the arrowe neuer hitteth the whyte. As for me, I thinke she shal sure be deceyued (wherof I meane not to complayne) that trayneth hir harte in the loue of straungers trauaylers, bycause their affections be vncertayne and wandering lyke their bodies, wherefore be no more so vnaduised. Amid this petty quarrell, beholde a Damoysell (according to the law of ye continued daunce) kissed hir hande, presenting it vnto the knight of Meffy : and after great reuerence, graciouslye prayed him to make a turne about the Hall in fauour of the company. Unto whom, surprised with a little choller and despight, beeing interrupted so euill for his purpose, he answered with an vnassured trung: By the fayth of a Gentleman, Mistresse, you haue made verye euill choyse of me, as of one expert in this practise: neuerthelesse, to shewe the good wyll I haue to please the beautifull, whiche resemble you, to the vttermost of my power I will obey you. Then beganne he to make proofe howe cunnyng hee was in all courteysie: for although he were actiue and strong of body so it is that the presence of his forced friend (for whom he would willingly haue flowen to heauen,) so vrged his agilitie with the stroke of a priuie spurre (as I thinke) sure he could not haue deliuered suche lustinesse, if Cupid him selfe had not lent him his wings. Nowe after he had daunced with the Damoysell according to the lawe of the game, seeing he was all alone, when the season moued him to choose a companion, he felt him selfe so straightly drawen by the inuisible line of loue, as he was forced to returne from whence he was departed. And as the hare hunted to the spending, returneth to receyue hir death at the couert or copice where the houndes first founde hir: so this louer sought hir out, who had giuen him so liuely a tainte, as the marke thereof was imprinted in the botome of his heart. Unto whome he sayde: Madame the common sort saye, the Adamant draweth the yron, but you will enforce me to proue the yron of your hart draweth the Adamant, the Adamant (I say) which nowe commeth to choose you, and finishe the ende of this trauayles. So with courtly deuises he ledde hir to daunce, where executing the mysterie of the exercise, after he had acquitted his acte from well to better, he left hir, and retyred from whence he came, attending hir returne into the next place. In the meane time he courted the nexte Damoysell, demaunding of hir what Lady she was that daunced. Unto whom the Damoysell answered, Upon mine honour Syr, you could not make your repaire to any better than vnto me, to be fully satisfied of your demaunde, who haue bene a perpetual companion of hir mishap, the which when you vnderstande, you will be striken with compassion. Be you therfore aduertised, Syr knight, that at the last warres which were betwixt the Poles and the Moscouites , the Moscouites had so great aduauntage (beeing ayded with Heathen armies) as their enimies with all the Christian forces coulde not let the entrie into the countrie of Russia , and al the region of Transsiluania : the whiche so greatly astonied the Almaynes , as they demaunded succours of the king of Denmarke , who beeing a neighbour ought chiefly to haue bene moued to resist a common enimie. The king, with his confederates leuied a puissant armie, and rendered the quarrel so carefully, as him selfe would go in person, where (for that he was noble and valiant) he pressed so forwarde, that all his hoste was slayne, and him selfe taken and sore wounded. It happened on the other side (as one misfortune neuer commeth alone) the Westerne armie by sea was tossed with suche tempest, as the shippes and galleys were dispearsed and rolled hither and thither: Of the which a small number after the turmoyle of peruerse Fortune, were cast vppon the coaste of Gedrosia and Carmania . And because they were few, they durste not wette an anker, but lyke Searouers and Pyrates they kept the sea, spoyling the Marchauntes whiche came to traffique in the East countrey. Whervpon it chaunced (as where there is game there is great resort) these fugitiues in time grew in consortship with others, and fortified themselues, in such sort as they conspired to hazarde their liues in a greater enterprise. Wherby it fortuned, beeing drawen into the Bay of Meda , from whence men may discouer the plentifull citie of Ecbatanes , and neere thervnto a princely palace of pleasance, where at that time was the Princes of Meda , the Princesse of Suses , and my selfe, thither came these Pirates on shore, who hauing robbed and pilfered the most precious things that were therin, (and I dare auouche there was as great plentie of treasure as in any one place of Asia ) they tooke away the two Princesses, passing not foure yeeres of age, and me: the residue of other women and seruaunts they left there, but I would neuer abandon my Mistresse. Sodainely the Commons thereabout came running to the rescue to recouer vs, but we had now passed the Gulfe, and made sayle into the mayne sea, where we stayed not long, but our Pyrates, constrayned to flye by Nicander prince of Siria , made homeward, and ariued on the coast of Zelande , where was at that time the Queene mother, and my lady the princesse Amire hir daughter, laying a tribute vppon the people for the kings raunsome. She hauing vewed these two pretie prisoners, and vnderstanding they were stollen Princesses, retayned them to keep hir daughter company, and commaunded the Rouers to restore vnto them their Iewels and treasure: but within a while after the Princesse of Meda (hauing in this tender infancy endured the torment of the Sea) fel sicke and died. So remained but the Princesse of Suzes , whom yeu see there, and of whom you meruayle, named Parthenia . Now the death of hir companion cost muche: for hir father payed the raunsome of the king of Denmarke , who was prisoner vnto the Tartarians , and for vengeaunce of his daughters death slewe him. And there is no doubt, but all men thinke we are all dead: for this king who nowe keepeth vs, will suffer no man to knowe newes of vs, vntill he be recompenced at full for his fathers death. But what charge soeuer he hath giuen me to conceale the matter, I haue sworne to report it to all men, and possible among many, some gentle heart may be founde, who will succour vs in this necessitie. By my God (answered the knight) you haue recited vnto me a straunge aduenture, and I knowe not howe Fortune durst execute so great mischiefe vpon hir, whose diuine graces deserued to be exempte from hir tyrannie. But though vniuste Fortune hath bereeued hir of an earthly Realme, Nature in recompence hath gyuen hir domination and signiorie ouer all humaine heartes, rendering hir without any doubt Queene of all fayre earthly creatures. Upon these speeches the king (after the banquet) tooke his leaue of the whole companie, who departed verye well content with the magnificence of this Court, except the knight of Meffy , who (as the striken Hart not finding any Dittany to heale his wounde, languishing seeketh the next Fountayne to yeeld his deadly gaspe) departed wofull and pensiue, vnable to conceale howe deepely he was wounded in minde. The which the Lordes which accompanied him sufficiently excused: and to comfort him commended exceedingly the Princesse Amire , meaning it faythfully. Upon these deuisings they went to bedde. But alas it was a bedde of greefe and turmoyle vnto the knight of Meffy , who (as the fyre is more hotte the closer it is couered) euen so his passion handeled him so muche more extremely, as he durst not complayne it, nor communicate the same vnto his companions, for feare not onely to be esteemed wauering and light, hauing so sodaynely altered his affection, but euill aduised to haue loste so muche by exchaunge, resembling the louers of Penelope , who when they coulde winne nought by the Maistresse, became suters to the seruauntes. Notwithstanding (sayde he) flattering his folly, I neede not be ashamed of that, for the whiche the renowmed Grecian Princes haue beene neuerthelesse esteemed. Who, among the glorious conquestes of Troye , disdayned not the loue of fayre Chambermaydens. Among which troupe of base degree, God forbid I should place you deare Lady Parthenia , for both the haughtie bloud wherof you are extraught, and also the graces wherewyth the Heauens with contention haue enobled you, worthily deserueth your person should be preferred of all men, among the most excellent Princesses. And although Fortune hath pleased to make a false bound towards you, yet is it not in hir puissance so much to hinder your good hap, but in time you may be the mistres of a mightie king. Oh how blessed was the day which gaue me aduise to repaire vnto this place, to receiue so great happinesse, the which I hope it wil procure me: for whatsoeuer rigour hir chast forehead hath shewed me (wherin hir noble hautinesse  & good nurture could not conceale it selfe) so it is, in ouerthrowing me with one had, she hath raysed me with the other, wherby I haue a secrete testimonie: And if according to the opinion of the wise, Nature hath made the eares and taile of vnreasonable creatures mouable, and in respect thereof the eye of man flexible, therby by dumbe speaches to bewray & testifie the interiour affectios, I may promise my selfe good issue of my desires, by the affection which the last glaunces of hir eye bewrayed vnto me. The do I not loue hir by false title, neither is it to be demauded why (for to aske wherfore me loue beautie, is a blind mans question, & requireth a dumbe mans answere.) Wherfore I must be resolued from henceforth to returne with this happy conquest, & leaue behind ye marks of a king of England, disguised by the wil of loue, in the shape of a simple knight, without any strangenesse to me, that it hath made me chage my name, sith the same caused Iupiter to chage his forme, to shew, it must not be respected how, so that a man may attaine his desire. Thus imagined thys poore louer, whe turning his ouerwatched eyes towards the windowe, he perceyued the dawning of the day, and heard the Cocks, who by the crowing called men vnto their ordinarie trauayle. Whereby he receyued so great comfort, as sodenly he arose, and arayed him at all poyntes, without awaking any of his companions, then all alone he went foorth and walked into a little grouet whiche was at hande, wherein wandering, at last he came vnto a very pleasaunt poole, whiche for the neighborhood of the Forrest Hercyna , and the Rockes whiche enuironne the water called Noirbois , and Pacena la Roisiniere , there hee stayed (alas) beholding the swans bathing among the Bulrushes: And perceyuing him selfe in place where only the trees and waters could heare his words, he lay downe vpon the grasse, and began the complaint of his dolours thus: For sith the Euen you sawe dame Beautie blaze Hir radiant beames by torchlight for disporte, Proude Cupids yoke hath mazde me in hir maze: I was then franke and free, now cloggde with care, My daintie cheare is changde to lothsome fare. The more I am obedient to hir will, The more to me hir crueltie abounds, The more I flee to shunne the greater yll, The more hir snares my staggering steppes confounds: And aye the more she hath my heart in chace, The more I doe pursue hir Princely grace. VVhat meane remaynes in mine vnhappie state, Resembling right the dayly running brooke, VVhose course dammde vp, to stay his woonted gate, VVith stronger streames ryues out at euery nooke: So my desire increaseth so muche more, As hope doth scant, to salue my pining sore. Nought resteth, but that you my traytorous eyes, Lament the breache of your disloyall truste, And curse the night wherin you were the spies, To seeke and like sweete beautie so vniuste: You all haue sworne, and practised the waye, To yeelde my youth to ruine and decaye. Then calling to remembraunce some surmised contentation receyued in dreaming the nighte passed, (as there is none in so myserable estate, but sometyme by dreames accompteth hymselfe happy) hee sayde. The carefull nurse of Venus waywarde boye, Thoughe death presented be in thine extreames, And feare dothe shrowde in shade of thine anoye, Yet I (alas) like more thine irkesome sight, Than to beholde the ioyes of Phebus light. VVith closed eies thy power hath made me viewe, My stopped eares thou haste compeld to heare, The fame, and speach, that makes my harte to rue, And feeds my thoughts, with sucke of sowre cheare, I ioye and mourne within thy carefull cage, As men do smile possest with rauing rage. O dreaming Dormouse, drownde in daily sleepe, I grudge to see thy long delightfull reste, O Morpheus , yeelde vpon my limmes to heape The burthen graunted once, vppon requeste Vnto Endymion and Epiminyde , Or let mine eies their fatall sleepe abide. After thinking vppon the resolution, he had concluded to prosecute his enterprise to effecte, and to possesse hymselfe wyth the seigneurie of his best beloued, he beganne his disseuered Sonet on this manner: on Indian shoare abides, The beating of the foming Seas in calmes and surging tides: VVithout the honoure, price, or praise, to suche a iewell due, Vntill the prudent Traueller doth take thereof the viewe, And doth enchace the same in golde, by cunning Goldsmiths skill, VVhiche done, he rates the price thereof according to his will: So vnder cruell carefull yoke, of seruitude vniuste, Perthenia spent hir tender yeares, and chiefest time of luste, Vntill a King of forraine lande, by Fortune preste in place, To winne hir to his wedded sire, bycause he knewe hir race: For as the glittering golde is drawne, from oute the nurses breaste, To shewe the shining hewe thereof, in spite of mysers reste. And as men plucke the pleasaunte fruite, from braunche of tender tree, So is the fragrant smelling rose stript from the twig (we see) To frame thereof gay posies sweete, by cunning handy slight, To whome the fading flowers oughte to yelde ioye and delight. At these wordes Eccho hidden in the woodes and rockes, aunswered the laste word ( delight .) Whereat the King astonied, looked rounde aboute hym, but perceyuing no person, supposing it had bin some deitie, who in compassion of his torment, came to comforte him (as the nations of the north partes haue more communication with spirites, than any other vnder Heauen) vntill hee perceiued it was an Eccho , wherevppon he reasoned therewith in this order. If thou remember, (Nimph) I praye thee tell Howe thou in loue with faire Narcissus fell, And scanne my choice, if it be ill or well, Well. Declare from whence these crooked thoughts proceede, VVhiche thus in haste my harte hath occupide. Cupide. VVhat happy chaunce ensues for my reliefe, Saye on, whose ioyes consumed are with griefe, Griefe. VVhat griefe? Alas the end must cruell bee, But can no meane redresse my woe, but shee? Shee. If none but she, then can I not denye, To heare hir voice, none shoulde reioyce but I . I. Describe, good friende, what meane is best for mee, To winne hir loue, whome I but once did see? see. And seing hir, my minde howe shall I breake, To shewe my woe by sighes, or else to speake? speake. But what is beste to quench the flame of loue? If death were due, I woulde his pangs approue. proue. And by what wordes my seruice muste I proffer, To ease the ill, that loue to me dothe offer? offer. VVhat beste auailes, to write, or speake, to spend? To get good will saye, shall I goe or sende? sende. Howe muste I worke hir fauoure to preserue, If once the same my lucke be to preserue? serue. And if for loue, of loue I doe not misse, VVhat muste I doe, to pleasure my maistrisse? this. To like of loue, when men the meane doe haunte, VVhat way is beste to bid their loue aununt? vaunt. O Cupids friende, what sacrifice or shifte, Of beauties pardon, maye obtaine the gifte? gifte. If giftes so please, as maides thereby consent, VVhat then behoues, I shoulde doe this present? present. These good aduertisementes contented so exceedingly the curious louer, as they moued his desire to prosecute this aduise, wherefore calling to remembraunce the Princesse Amira , hee demaundes: And what shall I doe in the loue of the Princesse. cease. And if that any saye, I loue faire Perdenie? denie. Thus he solicited his troubled mind in this solitarie pleasure demaunding and aunswering hymselfe manye questions vntill at length arising, he perceiued by the shortening of hys shadow the daye was well spent, wherefore hee thoughte it was tyme to retourne vnto hys companions (whome by his presence he eased of greate doubt and care, whiche troubled them for his absence) and prayed them to goe vnto the kings vprising, and giue hym good morrowe, and to excuse hym towardes his Maiestie, that hee came not according to hys duetie, for that hee was euill at ease, and thereby constrained to keepe his chamber. Whereof the king was more sorrowfull than faire Perthenia , for that shee onelye knewe well hys melodie was not mortall, but suche as chaunceth a hundreth times an houre. Nowe whilest oure martyr was alone, and that his sorrowe had kepte hym in waking the whole night, yet slept he not, but thinking what Eccho had saide vnto hym, determined by some meanes to manifest truely, that hee was intirely at the commaundement of hys Lady Perthinya , whiche is as much to saye in oure language, as Virgine . Wherfore leaste we shoulde borrowe ought of any straunger, we wyll hereafter name the Ladye Virginia . Nowe the meane that loue (which wakeneth the spirites) caused this Prince to inuent, was to put the letters of his handy writing, in the bottome of a boxe of Comfets, so was it concluded and sodainely executed. For the night no sooner approched, but disguysed with his companions: (vnto whome he had imparted all hys conceites) hee wente in maske vnto the Courte: where beeing entred, after reuerence done to the king, euery man pressed to the damoisell he beste lyked, but the Knight of Meffy presented his Comfets in a siluer boxe, (wherevppon was grauen the Image of Faith, sitting vppon a rocke, holding Cupid by the wings) into the lap of his Lady Virginia . During these sportes, there came in another company of maskers, among the whiche one at the firste dashe courted Virginia , shouldering aside the knight in despight. And although it were verye grieuous vnto oure Englishe Prince, yet in respect of the place, helde him contented, tempering his choller, and dissembling the reuenge hee pretended. The Mummeries ended, the mesures mattycins, and brawles beganne, after the whyche many preatie disports, as stripping the Eele, brideling the Asse, taking the Frogge, and others: vntill the king taking his leaue, eche one departed without discouerture. But they wer no sooner wythout the Courte gate, but there begunne a newe game: for the two maskers laide hand on their weapons,  & charged eche other so fiercely, as the knight of Meffie enraged wyth choller, by forbearing his aduersaries brauery, longer than his noble courage could tollerate, marching furiously through the presse, like a braue bull in sight of a yong heycforth, skirmished so couragiouslye, as with the firste stroke hee layde the nexte vnto hym on the earthe, being in hys rage thruste throughe the bodye wyth hys rapier, and woulde haue marked the reste with the bloud of the firste, had not the archers of the kings guarde, (running to the hurly burly) parted the fraye. And bicause they were so hardy to beginne this broile so neare the Kings lodging, (at so vnlawfull season) they ledde them readily vnto the nexte prison, vntill morning, that the king might consider thereof at his leysure. In the meane time, the poore knight of Meffy , (who with the residue was committed to a grated cabine) turmoiled himselfe in great torment of body and anguish of minde. For (saide he) those who assaulted me, are sure some Princes, yea happily the moste notable of thys Countrey, who hauing receiued the worst, will easyly make men beleeue they were set vpo, especially, sith one of the is slaine, except I be deceyued: which will cause vs by theyr credite, to suffer some shamefull death. And for me I dare not auouch my selfe king of England, for the safegarde of me and my company: for in so doing, either I shall be esteemed an impudent lyer, and a manifest dissembler, or a secreate espie: Whereby I might turne the poore Marquesse to great trouble, who for faithfull amitie would neuer declare what I was. Upon these forecasts, the desolate Prince heard one open the prison dore, and sodainely perceyued the Marquesse of Lubecke enter in, who beeing knowen  & honoured of the Gaoler, had libertie to go where he pleased. The Marquesse fell down before ye feete of the knight of Meffy ,  & saide vnto him: Alas my Lorde, how may I amende the fault I haue committed against your Maiestie, that so rashly haue assaulted you this euening? would to god in paiment of my folly, your gracious hand had slaine me in steede of my seruant: what? said ye knight (embracing him graciously) was it you then (vnhappy man) that so discourteously scoffed me yesternight. By my life, had I knowen you, I had not now bin lodged here: yea sir, I assure you to my great griefe (answered the Marquesse) it was my selfe, whose minde was more masked tha my face. And I wot not howe you shoulde haue knowne mee, sith I knew not my selfe, so muche the loue of the Princesse of Suzes had blinded me, with whome I founde you deuising, as it made mee desire, and also purchase euill vnto him, for whome I woulde endure all calamities. Truely (replied the knight) Loue seemeth verye vniust in rendering you enimy vnto him that wisheth so much good vnto you. But this is not all, for (my trusty friend) sith occasion copelleth me to shew you ye thing, which is most secrete vnto me, I must require you (if euer amitie had power in the hearte of a knight) yt you wil heape one benefit vpo another, therby to binde a prince for euermore strictly vnto you, who is more miserably entreted by loue, tha euer was ma. Whervnto sith you haue ministred the originall, you must procure an end, except you conclude that death shal finish it. Alas sir (answered the Marquesse) is it in my power to deny you any thing? wherfore pray you him vpon whom you haue al puissance to commaund? protesting  & swearing vnto you by the duty which bindeth me vnto your seruice (for by a greater matter on earth I cannot sweare) that if you vouchsafe to do me so greate honour, as to employ me, you shall finde me faithfull & obedient vnto the end. Do you promise me (friend) said the knight? The this is the earnest request I am to make vnto you, that sith my destiny, be it good or bad, hath allotted me in exchange of my first determination, to harbor in ye lodging you haue chosen, consuming me miserably in the loue of your maistrisse, that you will pleasure me so much (if you teder ye life of a perfect friende) if euer courtesie lodged in you, to resigne your right & title, which you pretend in our comon friend, whom I know is more auncient vnto you, but not so lawfull & needeful as vnto me, for recopence wherof, demaund of me goods, body, & life, to the ende you shal not doe thys pleasure to an vngratefull person. And if I be denied, I had better haue bene slaine thys night wt your sword, tha languish by your rigor. And if our loue receiue any counterchange, I hope to abrogate fro you al occasion of complaint, rendering you a worthy recompence. For I wil (if you like therof) giue you my sister in mariage, & in respecte of hir dowry, I will make you Lorde of the Isles of Orchades, Ireland ,  & Cornewaile . In good faith aunswered the Marquesse, the match is so much for my profite,  & my duty so gret towards you, as I were both foolish and lewde, if I should not consent thervnto. Wherfore feare not fro henceforth, yt we wil play ye tragedie of Aurelio , who slewe his friend for the loue of his louer Isabella ,  & be not grieued for this matter: for assure your selfe, I wil make you experiment the fruites of my true amitie. And from henceforth I do not only resigne hir vnto you, in whome I haue preteded so gret interest: but also promise you, it shal cost me my life, but shee shall be yours, & that shortely. For thys aunswere the knight, (besides an vnmeasurable ioy) could do nothyng, but embrace the Marquesse, more feruently than Hercules embraced Anthea : recommending hys promise vnto him a thousande and a thousande tymes. Ah pleasaunte prison, whiche purchased libertie vnto two bondeslaues of loue, by one operation contrary to the other. During these actions (honorable audience) what say you faire Virginia did, saue onely repaire vnto hir chamber (wher beeyng alone wyth hir Damoysell named Diana ) shee beganne to visite hir drugs, and tooke the boxe, to knowe what was therein? the whiche either by haste or fortune, shee opened the contrary waye, so as the couer being downewarde, and the bottome vpwarde, al powred forth vpon the table. Then the letters which wer hidden in ye bottome, fel out with ye rest, sealed with ye signet, which forthwith shee remembred shee had seene vppon the letters, whiche the king of Englande had sent vnto the princesse Amire , and supposed they had bin the same, if shee had not read the superscription, whiche said: To my Lady Virginia Princesse of Suzes, and Queene of beautie in hir chamber . Then appalled with maidenly shame,  & broyling in desire to viewe what this might meane, she brake the seale, and found a ring, wherin were married a rich Diamant, & a precious Emerald: which by their coniunction composed the figure of a heart: & the deuise was, The ende of my hope : whiche vrged hir ardent desire, to be more earneste to reade the contentes of the paper, which was. Madam , vnderstanding (after mine affectionate enqueste) the vnkinde partes fortune hath played you, to shewe hir puissance, I was not onely stricken with extreame griefe, but maruelously amazed, that the heauens hauyng heaped in you the treasure of all perfections, hath not by some priuiledge freed you of this tiranny, when vnto al mortall things are subiecte:  & also I maruelled exceedingly, how this Danish nation hadde so hard harts, to keepe you here in captiuitie, vnworthy for youre merits, but that their Histories, Chronicles, & Cote armours, sufficiently testifie their progenies to proceede fro ye race of a beare. But that whiche is most admirable is, that you remayning a prisoner, haue power to make captiue the most brauest Kings: as I haue very well experimented, sith leauing the countrey and landes of mine obeysaunce, to viewe if the bruite of the Princesse Amires beauties were true, bicause my mistrustfull mind would credite none but mine owne eyes, I haue borowed the name of the knight of Meffy : which distrust prouoketh me, in seeking wel in hir, and finding better in you Madam, of force to chaunge mine affection to the aduauntage of mine amorous choyce, and to yeelde my selfe the seruaunt of your perfections: of the which I implore mercy and fauour in recompence of my louing seruice: Desiring, that as your beautie hath made you mistresse of suche a king as I am, so your loue may make you Ladie of suche a mightie Realme, whereby you shall be reuenged of cruell Fortune, and I of rigorous loue: as he, who for the heape of all his good happe, desireth by your ayde and consent) he may be called for euer, The captiue of your good graces, William king of Englande . I commit to their iudgements that haue proued the like effect in them selues, if these letters put a flea in the fayre Ladies eare, and if they ayded hir to passe the night in many fantasticall discourses, which like a double edged knife wounded hir with hope and feare, interpreting these Letters sometime for a scoffe, and presently repenting hir lewde suspition, whereout the next day deliuered hir, or at least gaue hir comfort. Wherin the king sent for the prisoners, and hauing by them information of the whole quarrell (notwithstanding any excuse they coulde coyne) he pardoned them, so as the facte became a courtly iest. True it is, he sayde vnto them, My friendes, if I had thought you would haue discried your selues by suche tokens, I had dismasked you yesternight. Then began the accustomed pastimes, during whiche the knight of Meffy entertayned the good graces of his Lady Virginia : who quiting his curtesie with languishing lookes, made semblant that the delicate druggs had made effectuall operation, and by their straunge confection had disgested the bitternesse of hir heart: So as after a fewe fine introductions of pleasaunt deuise, they entred in conclusion into the principall poyntes of their pretence, after fayth giuen and receyued on both partes at the instaunce of the Lady, who sayde vnto hir Knight: Syr, if you surmise, for that you are mightie, and I a poore disinherited Princesse, that I beare so lowe a sayle, or possesse so base a minde as to consent vnto any villanye, you shall be muche deceyued: for I had rather spende the remainder of my yeres (if it please not God otherwise) with myne equalles, yea and to be accompanied vnto my graue with importune miserie, carying with me the spoyle of chastitie, which neuer yeelded vnto the stormes of tempestuous Fortune, than to lyue in full possession of the wicked blisse, which they enioy that enriche their pouertie with the losse of their good renowme. But if it please you to honour me with your sacred amitie, and to binde me vnto you with the bande of chast wedlocke, I will from hencefoorth liue and dye in your loyall seruice. Why minion (answered the knight) are ye of opinion, that my heart is so carelesse, and my face so impudent to attempte violation by lasciuious loue agaynst the beautie which God hath planted in you as in an vnuiolable temple? No no, I call the Almightie to recorde (who knoweth the secretes of all heartes) that if my wordes be not conformable to my thoughts, the reuenging heauen, with al the elements, conspire my ruine, rather than I may euer consent vnto dishonest loue, or other than behoueth the true faythfull amitie of a louing husbande. Wherevnto the Uirgin answered, closely griping hir hands: Iason promised all this when he purposed to cary away his louer, whom when he enioyed, he performed nothing. But I trust a louing Medea shall finde in you a loyall Iason . To be short, these two louers pretending to make a wicket in the water,  & to shape their course towards England, parted copany: and the knight hauing giuen vnto his Lady for gage of his good wil a ring, wherin was grauen a Cocke, which seemed to espie his time to crow, holding a scotchion in his foote, wherin was written Oportunitie , the which the Princesse and hir damoysel attending, the king commaunded the Duke of Clarence , the Earle of Arundell , and the Earle of Hertforde (who knewe their watcheworde, and were beaten to the beck) to giue attendaunce for receite of all hir Iewels  & moueables of price, which should be deliuered vnto them the night folowing at a false window apointed for the conueiaunce therof vnto the kingship. The day following the Marques came to visite the knight of Meffy , aduertising him that he had found a very expedient meane to execute the accomplishment of his desires, which was, that the next day he would inuite ye king to take a banket at a Castle he had neere vnto the Court, where he would work as much as was possible for the conueyance of the Lady Virginia : but touching himselfe, it should be necessary to stay a while after them, to the ende the knight might escape more assuredly,  & that he might qualifie the crime, & somwhat pacifie the kings rage: which done, he would choose at leisure some couenient season to follow likewise. This beeing determined, our English nobles aduertised captaine Grecy , who taried aborde, that the next morning al things should be in a readinesse, and also the Princesse. Eche one executed his office so aptly, as the Court, beeing at the Castle of the Marques, which was called Larcheroc , after dinner they went to course in the Forest of Hyrcina , wherabout the gentlemen and damoysels were very attentiue. In the meane while the Englishe lordes hauing giuen the princesse Virginia a watch to linger behinde  & step aside, they played their partes so kindly, as they deceiued the whole company in hir conueyance. But it was easy to be deuined in the euening, when the Princes, hir damoisel, & the English Lords were missed, which gaue sodaine occasion of suspect to al men, that they had stollen hir away. But aboue the rest, the Marques appered so much moued, as the fire seemed to sparkle out of his eyes, & besought the king to fauour him so highly, as he would suffer him to reuenge the dishonour and outrage done vnto his Maiestie, for which he was the more offended, bicause the fact was perpetrated in his house. Wherfore ye king prayed him to use diligence: And immediatly euery man tooke horse to accompanye the Marques in pursuite of the Englishmen, who fled by an vnvsed waye, notified unto them, and the Marques sought them, where he was assured not to finde them. So as after they had long beaten the deserts and playne champion, they were constrayned to returne in vayne, more discomfited than breathlesse grayhoundes, hauing lost the hare after a long course. Thus was the feast ended, and the king so highly displeased, as he would haue dispatched Embassadours to make complaynt of this outrage vnto the king of Englande, & craue reuenge thereof: but that he was enformed by diuers likelyhoods, it was the King in person who had done this deede. Upon this report the king, by the aduice of his Counsel, commaunded to apprehende the Marquise of Lubecke , who was ready to flee. But alas the poore Lorde made too leysurable haste, for beeing charged of cofederacie and collusion with the king of England, whom he knewe by the name of the knight of Meffy , and concealed the same from the priuitie of his Prince, as also beeing an aider and furtherer of this iniury, and a faulter of this rape, vnto the great displeasure of his king, and dishonour of hys Realme, he was put to the torture: wherevpon making open confession, he was conuicted, and as a traytour to his Prince beheaded in his owne castle of Larcheroc , where this conspiracy was executed. For the whiche the whole buylding was razed downe vnto the first stage thereof, and a gibbet erected therevpon, in perpetuall memorie of the crime. Suche was the recompence of this vnfortunate minister of loue, who (yf I should dye therefore) worthily deserueth to be enrolled among the perfectest and faithfullest friendes euer liuing. For so much as beeing freely depriued of his Lady, to pleasure his companion, which ought to haue bene as deare vnto him as his life, he neither esteemed the losse of honour, wealth, or life, no nor his cheefe worlds delight, to establishe the rewarde of his perfecte amitie: which shall for euer make me esteeme those Princes happie which possesse the treasure of a true friend. The mightie king of Persia , beeing demaunded what he moste desired, not without iuste cause, aunswered: To haue as many faythfull friendes, as there were kernels in a Pomgranate. But the occasion wherefore great Lords are so poore, and yll prouided of this benefite, is, bicause they can beate flyes from their face, and not banishe flatterers from their eares: the which (as Harlots vse their louers) desire all goodnesse to the Masters, except wisedome, which onely openeth their eyes, forbidding them to nourishe the thing that consumeth them, as fire consumeth wood. Nowe leauing the Marques in eternall reste, we will returne towards our knight of Meffy , who was departed in all pleasure and contentation, hauing nowe attached the ende of all his cares, carying away his louing Lady, as long agone Jupiter conuayed his friend Europa : vnto whom he shewed so great curtesie, as she could any way wishe, like the couetous miser, who is neuer contented but when he continually beholdeth his heapes of treasure. Thus they iourneyed in al hast towards the ship, so that when the prince spurred his horse to make the more speede, the fearefull saddle pinched so his body, as it constrained to wishe the exchaunge of his uneasie horse vnto a soft bed, the more pleasauntly to finishe their voyage. The which was not long before they came to the sea side, where their shippe was in redynesse, attending their comming: the king and the rest beeing entred, the mariners set sayle, and by good hap had so fayre and large a wind, as with a short cut they arriued vpo the coast of England, where their desire attended them,  & the king with his trayne landed vnwares, and lesse expected of any so sodenly. The Princesse beautie was had in admiration of al men, but especially, when the king wedded hir, beeing solemnized by the ministery of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the bishop of Winchester. But the Lady beeing accompanied but with one Gentlewoman, seemed to all men an unworthy matche for his highnesse. Behold our Louers now sufficietly satisfied for all the paynes endured, and it may rightly be iudged, they nowe dispised Fortune, and trode hir malice under their feete: who laughing at their delightes, brued them other businesse whiche they coulde not auoyde, as you shall hereafter perceyue. Alas, what bale encountreth the man that trusteth in his blisse, and seeketh assuraunce therein: sith the smiling of Fortune is but a bayte to deceyue vs, as she whiche hath no pleasure but in turning hir wheele: as this poore Prince had good experience, who in the middest of his delightes, when he thought to enioy pleasaunt quietnesse, was tossed with the turmoyles of newe trauayles. For you shall understande, that when the whole Court was solaced in pastime, pleasure, and delight, there arriued a Danishe Harolde, who making fierce enquirie for the knight of Meffy , beeing presented before the king, did his message vnto him on this maner: The right puissaunt king of Denmarke hath sent thee the heade of the Marquise of Lubecke , with protestation neuer to lyue in quiet, untill he hath the heade of the knight of Meffy in counterchaunge. Then he presented to the king a Letter, conteyning great iniuries and reproches, aduertising him in conclusion, that he woulde make a bridge of ships to passe out of his countrey into England, with an arme of suche might, as the rauishment of Helen neuer cost so deare vnto the Troians, as he would make his rape vnto the English men. Whervnto the king of England made briefe answer, excusing his person by the force of loue: also that the matter was not great, to take away a Uirgin with hir owne consent, which was uniustly kept as a bondslaue. But if any man would be so madde to attempt any thing agaynst his quiet for that occasion, he would assay to shewe by force of armes, that the right was on his parte, and touching the rest, threatnings were to make children afrayde. With this aunswere the Messanger returned: and when the spring of the yeere approched, the king of Englande beeing aduertised that his enimie made preparation to visite him, he leuyed a puissaunt army to ease him of his paine. Wherevpon apparelling his Nauy, and shipping his men, munition, and artillerie, determined to goe in person to debate the quarrell, accompanied with suche Princes and Barons as he pleased to choose, the whiche determining to shewe their valour, had the wind so at wil, as though they had bought it of Eolus : or as men say, the Grecian Prince had, who caried a bagge full of winde to supply his want at all times. Now they had not sayled long, but they discouered a great fleete of shippes, which the mariners iudged by their flagges and pendents to be Easterlings: wherof the king beeing enformed, commaunded euery Captayne to man their botes, and furnish the fights, and to be in al readinesse to giue the charge, bycause he minded to stem the enimie fleete in the night about the rising of the Moone. Which was so politickly practised, and valiatly executed, as of al the Danish preparation there, was scarsly sufficient for a breakfast: For beeing taken as they were waying ancre,  & redy to put romee, they were vanquished with ease: but the Conqueror not content with this expedition, landed his army in the coutrey of Westphalia , whose conflicts were so furious, as the frontire townes, which beforetime valiantly withstoode the enimie, were taught to yeelde without resistaunce. Nowe whilest this victorious king proceeded in these confusions, for reuenge of the Marques of Lubecks death, his deare friende, many sedicious princes which he had left in Englad to supply his absence, imagined diuers practises to stir the subiects to rebellion agaynst the king, who (sayd they) to fulfill his disordinate appetite, had put al the Realme in daunger of ruine, hauing maried a woma which did but dishonour the countrey, and had wedded him vnto a war so daungerous, as if it were not speedily preuented, the Realme should perish for the pleasure of one. This reason seemed tollerable to aide some to atchieue the effect of their desired pretence, which was, to rule the Realme, if others moued with the like ambition, had not resisted their intent: but as the pray remayneth vnspoyled, where two Lions contend to enoy it: So the two houses of Yorke and Lancaster, hindered eche other to attaine the gouernment which they both desired. So as all the Princes beeing assembled in secret councel, and as it were hand in hand, without the knowledge of the Queene, (who medled not with any affayres concerning the comon wealth) they ordeined, that for the tranquilitie of England, it was needeful to abridge the occasion of the war, videlicet , to make away this new Q. forged by fantasie: but that it was couenient to put hir to death so secretely, as all cause of suspicion might be abandoned, for feare to enrage the king, who they knew loued hir feruently, and not with any voluble good wil, although it were begun at the volue: And further, for feare Ciuill warre myghte bee ingendred of this forraine iarre, much more pernicious and domageable vnto the weale publike of the lande. Wherein the kings youthfulnesse was somewhat to be excused, who was sufficiently punished by the trauailes he endured, and paied very dearely for his folly. Nowe the Queene (as one neither beloued of al, nor hated of euery one) was sodainely aduertised of this determination by some of the matche makers, whyche was of a gentle nature, (whosoeuer he was) whereby fearing to be preuented presently, she made a banquet for al the nobilitie, faining she did the same, bycause she sawe them all assembled togither. Unto whom shee vsed so greate magnificence, and disposed all hir endeuour in so courteous wise to feaste them honourably, as if these barbarous bodies, had possessed humaine harts, they had bin mollified with the repentance of their inhumaine conspiracie, and had imitated the fabulous example of the rattes, whiche in their generall assembly, concluded for the benefite and safegarde of them all, to tye a bell aboute the cattes necke, whiche alwayes betrayed them vnwares, so as it seemed hir feete were made of wooll. But these bolde enterprisers, when the question was moued who shoulde knit on the bell, eche one excused himselfe, so as no executor was founde among them. After this solempne dinner, the beautifull princesse with a nuptiall countenaunce made obedient reuerence vnto the company, faining shee had a little secreate businesse in hir chamber, where she hadde prepared hir princely robes, without the knowledge of any, wherin she sodainely returned into the hall of the feaste, where all these guides were secreatly whispering in eche others eare, arming their heartes with mercilesse tiranny, and preparing their forces vnto the execution of their attempt. But the hardiest among them, was greately astonied, and surprised with terror, vewing this diuine beautie, vnexpected to enter the place, crowned wyth pearle and stone, and adorned in hir precious robes, attended on wyth hir Damoysels appareled in mournyng weede, carying in their hands, one poyson, another edge tooles, the third fire, the fourth cordes, and all the rest mortall instrumentes. Then the Queene pressed among the Princes, reporting at large what she was, of what place and parentage, the perillous aduenture she had sustayned, and in fine, whatsoeuer she had receyued in this Realme by the grace of hir Lorde and husband. Then altering at one instant both countenance and voyce: It is now time (sayde she) that I repay at this present, so many benefites receiued, yea with vsurie: which greeueth me not, hauing all my life long bin customarily subiect to miseries, but for sorowe I haue of the torment and displeasure which I know he shall receiue, who hath not deserued so great ingratitude of his subiectes. But wel, sith there is now question of death,  & that my cruell misfortune hath conducted me to this pityfull ende, drawe neare my friends, that your hard heartes may choose here (turning hir towards the tooles she had caused to be presented) what death you please I shall endure. Beholde all things ready wherwith you may entreat me as you please. The tearing open hir garmets, and baring hir lilly white brest: but viewe my person (sayd she) in more readinesse, frankly to suffer al kind of torments which this poore carkasse may possibly tollerate: come on therefore, satisfie your lust with my innocent bloud, dispatch, that sith my life so much annoyeth you, my death at least may content you. Come, come and slay the body, which your king hath so straitly and louingly embraced. Dye, dye, Virginia , and buylde a tomb of thine ashes, which may perpetually testifie the cruell recompence of thy chast life. Now adewe my deare Lorde and louing husbande: and into what part soeuer your valiauntnesse hath conuicted you, I beseeche almightie God to comfort and cherish you with eternall felicitie, in lieu of my so shorte consolation, and that the remembraunce of your deare wife Virginia may neuer depart out of your noble mind. The turning hir bedewed face towards hir faithfull damoysell Diana , she kissed hir with a long adewe: and falling flat to the earth, she lift vp hir moyst eyes, and ioyned hands towards heauen, attending hir mortall stroke. But oh how great is ye puissance of innocencie, accompanied with discrete speech? sith al the princes assembled to destroy this Lady, had not ye power to hurte hir: but hauyng their flinty hartes mollified with compassion, threw themselues at hir feete, filling al ye hall with teares  & lametations, requiring hir to pardon their vndiscrete audacitie. Wherevnto hir meeke clemencie easyly condiscended, praying the with embracings, to be no enimies to their king, who was so boutiful vnto the. Unto whome to returne, we must vnderstad, yt his warlike enterprises succeeded so fortunately to his wishe, as hauing spoiled all the coast of Freesland , he coquered ye whole coutry lying betwene ye mouth of Rheine ,  & the riuer of Alba , doing more tha al Emperors, who neuer passed further. And he had planted his triuphat pillers whiche iustly aspired to a longer marke, if fortune enuying hys heroicall vertues, had not bin opposite vnto this glorie, by ye strangest accidet yt might possibly be deuised. For you shal know (curteous copany), when ye councell of conspiracy was at ye banquet, as you haue heard, one of the knowing what tragedie they purposed to play, wold not be present thereat: but to auoide ye kings displeasure which might afterward ensue, forsooke the company,  & stealing away, came vnto ye campe wyth al speede to find ye king, to the end his being there might witnesse hee was not assistants to the treason. Unto whome, after humble reuerence done vnto hys Maiestie, with a sorrowful countenace he said: Right mighty Prince, if euer youre vertue serued you, it is necessarye at thys present to putte it in practise, & to arme you with constancie, to surmount ye dolor, wherewith I know the lamentable newes, whiche my duetie and disaster constraineth me to bring you, wil oppresse your valiant courage, yt I would to god I had bin borne without a tong. What is ye matter my friende (said ye king) how goeth the world at home? & how doth my louyng Queene Virginia ? Ha sir, answered the gentleman, I know not at what end to begin to satisfie your demaundes. But sith you must knowe the whole truth, maye it please you to vnderstande sir, that youre princes being displeased with this long war, esteeming ye Quene to be the onely cause thereof, resolued by a blondy counsell, to make an end thereof. An end I say the wickeddest in the worlde, for they haue by a bedlam traiterous conspiracie, put the Quene to death,  & are in danger to do worse, if your maiestie by youre speedy returne take not order therin. This spake the vnfortunate messeger, neuer thinking but the Lady (who as he had surely seene putting the corde about hir own necke, as is said) coulde not haue conuerted those to repentance, which were so obstinatly bent to accomplish their wicked willes. Neither called hee to remembrance what the braue Romaines Marcus Crassus ,  & Marius , had done before time, who the one by the onely force of hys tong, the other by his eies, caused the axe to fall out of the hangmans hand,  & mollified the executioners cruell mind. These wordes sliced so large a wound in the kings hart, as he fell downe in a sowne betweene the Marquesse Dorsets armes, so oppressed with mortall anguishe, as his finall trauaile was hardely preuented. The Messenger in the meane time departed happily from his presence, otherwise he had bin striken through with a dagger, in recompence of his paine: & surely he well deserued it, for hys foolish & vngracious tidings. Now the king somwhat come to himselfe, entred into such furie, as if hee had not bin strongly detayned from his will, he had plaide the parte of Aiax or Orestes : but euery man endeuouring dutifully to pacifie his furie, the Duke of Clarence said vnto hym. What sir? where is nowe the auntient vertue, wherewyth (as wyth a sure Ore) you haue accustomed to guyde and assure al your actions, and the sundry floudes of frowarde Fortune? Where is the constancie, wherewyth, as wyth a brydle, you tamed youre rebellious affections, making you triumphe by the glorious victorye of your selfe? Wyll you by the conceyte of a simple reporte (whyche is but wynde, so extinguish your naturall Magnanimitie? Retourne, retourne to your self Syr, and fortifye your mynd with perfect royall courage, to make these furious motions, and take leisure to vnderstande the true estate of euery thyng. And if youre people haue presumed to commit so gret outrage against you, we are ready to aide you to take a memorable vengeance vpon them, which is more decent for your estate than these feminine lamentations, and we assure you we wil al dye in your reuenge: it sure behoueth this wicked people, abusing youre delicate deaw should feele the force of your horrible thunder. Whervnto the king aunswered: ah my frendes, howe easie it is to counsell another in respect to aduise a mans selfe? Alas, where woulde you from henceforth I shoulde finde consolation, but onelye in death, sith I haue loste hir, who made me loue to liue? Oh brutishe nation, indurate people, you generation of yron, how durst you so vngratefully acknowlege the bountie of your king? Had his benefites no power to moue you? nor his puissaunt wrath, force to feare you? Alas, one onely sunne melteth the waxe, and hardeneth the myre, euen so benefites gaineth the good, and enrageth the wicked. But alas cruell and mad people, what hard harts had you to hurte hir, whose feete Lions and tygres would haue kissed? coulde not hir heauenly hewe, nor perfecte perfections tame your vnbrideled tiranny? Oh Virginia, Virginia , my deare wife Virginia , the liuely pearle of the Orient, shoulde I haue lefte thee among such mercilesse misers? who not hauyng in them wittes to knowe your valure and merite, haue wickedly sacrificed you. Alas Virginia , is the reporte that I haue loste thy sight for euer, and that I shall neuer more beholde thy louely face? Thus speaking, he turned hym aboute, and surmounted with his furious passion, hee groped with a tremblyng hande to feele where aboute his weary harte panted, and vnto the same place, hee fixed the pointe of hys dagger, and threwe hys body so directly thereon, with a mortal courage, as he sheathed the cold blade in his warme stomacke vp to the hilts. So as this noble hart, wherin hardinesse and loue made alwayes their habitation, beyng outraged by him, who shoulde haue defended it meekely receiued the approch of a peaceable death, which losing the soule from so many trauailes, gaue it possession of eternall rest. Thus was he vanquished in fine by dolour, who coulde neuer bee tamed by any, but by himselfe. Nowe the Princes beeyng aboute hym, supposed hee was tourned to aduise himselfe, and with reason to mortifie by little and little this sharpe griefe, but seeing him ouerthrowne, they perceyued too late the occasion thereof. Wherefore they demeaned suche sorrowe, as so greate a losse merited. Neuerthelesse, for feare to discomfort the campe, and outrage the enimy, who doubted more the king, than the souldiors, whose conducte is as requisite as their force, fained that the Kyng was sicke, and woulde departe and winter in Englande. Wherefore hauing put strong garrisons into most requisite places, for the guarde of the conquered countries, with bag and baggage they tooke shipping, and directed their course towardes England. Incontinent as the Queene was aduertised by those that discouered the fleete within harbor, that the campe was returned, she commaunded all the estates shoulde bee in readinesse to receiue the king triumphantly, and that she with al the Ladies of hir Court would meete him at his landing. Then all the Princes set forward with boughs and flowers, and with great pompe caried a crowne of Laurell in a Chariot drawne with foure white horses, enuironed with singing men, and musitions of all sortes. But alas, whether goe you amiable troupe with so greate affection? And you poore Lady (vncontented with extreame ioy,) Alas, whether flee you so hastily, as thoughe you shoulde neuer encounter the care, which seeketh to find you with all speede. Like as the bright Sunne, is sodainely darkened by a dimme cloude, euen so this ioyfulnesse was sodainely chaunged into bitter sadnesse. For as soone as they arriued at the Sea side, they were immediately enformed of the pitifull aduenture, but how muche more the Queene was ioyed with great contentation, so much the more she was troubled with extreame grief: when alas, in place of hir king, the knight of Meffy , whome shee attended to receiue louingly, she founde in a lamentable Litter, but the colde body from the whiche ardent loue, had berefte the soule. The obiect whereof put hir in minde of hir violent affections, constrained hir to fall in a sounde vpon the same, embracing the colde carcasse so carefully, as though she had bin iudged by the Tyrant Mezences , who bounde the liuing bodies to the dead, whiche she sought to reuiue and raise againe. And bicause it is vnpossible althoughe I had a tongue of yron, and a mouth of steele, and that my voice were of brasse, to declare the Martirdome whiche the desolate soule of these passionate princes endured, I had better saye nothing, than speake too little, imitating the example of the Painter Tamantes , who vnable liuely to discipher wyth hys pensell the wo of Agamemnon , seeing his only daughter sacrificed, couered hys face. As the miserable kyng Psammitie wept not seeing his children drawn through the streates, as hee didde to viewe hys friend so vsed, saying: that the griefe of hys children was too extreame to bee bewailed wyth teares. Euen so the rigor of the anguishe hadde so greate power in this Princesse, as she coulde not discharge one sigh, or shead a teare, but was taken awaye deade from thys laste embracing. Whereof euerye one was greatelye astonied, bycause the Phisitions assured them, that women could not dye of sorrow, howe sodaine and terrible soeuer it were, although bookes make mention, that one Laodamia vnderstanding of hir husbands deathe, died sodainely: but some good companions affyrme, hir deathe was suspected to proceede of ioye. True it is, that Iulia dyed of a mortall apprehension for the deathe of hir husband Pompey , but the occasion of hir deathe was, bycause shee was delyuered of childe before hir tyme. And that whiche was more miraculous in thys suddayne death, was, that shee looked not lyke a stifled creature, so as after greate adoe in searching the cause, they founde none other, but that a greate pinne, wherewith the lefte corner of hir partlet was pinned, had by reason of the stricte embracing of the harde body, entred vnder hir left pappe vnto the heade, wherewith hir harte was perished, the whiche not able to suffer any ill but death, after the collection of the bloude aboute it, resigned the gouernement of the body committed therevnto. And it is no doubte, but suche an accident myghte seeme straunge vnto you, if the example of a noble Ladye of Dawphine , chauncyng in oure dayes, ayded not youre credite therein, who being shoued aside by a Gentleman in ieste, pricked hir poulse with hir needle, wherof ensued a convulsion of the synews, and thervppon a sharpe feuer, whereof in the fyrste fitte she dyed. And this was the verye cause, that the two Romaines, which long since were striken, the one vpon the feete against the thresholde of the palaice gate, the other on the finger, with opening a dore, fell downe deade presently. Nowe if these being hurte on the feete, and the hand, haue loste their life, meruaile not if a wounde made in the harte had so great force, whereby we shold knowe, that it seemed reasonable vnto the celestiall wyll of god, that those whiche hadde liued in sole affection, shoulde dye of one stroke, gyuen in one selfe steede. Alas, howe tickle is the state of mans life, sith a weake pinne is sufficient to bee the minister of hys deathe. Let vs not meruaile though Anacreon dyed in drinking, by the kernel of a grape, or Ap. Sauleius in supping an egge, or the two Emperors by wrinching their foote in drawing on their hose. Thus ended the louers (vertuous company) who delighted not to liue the one after the other. And as it is oure peruerse nature to make none accompte of the good, vntill wee haue loste it, and that sorrowe for the wante of it teacheth vs the value thereof: so these, who in their lyfe tyme hadde been so euill knowen of the people, nowe being deade, were bewailed wyth continuall teares, and the myserable Subiectes testifyed, that theyr ingratitude was mortall, by the sumptuous funeralles they celebrated: and the riche wroughte Tombe they make for theyr Princes. Wherein (knowyng theyr soules hadde yet some care of their bodyes, and that nothyng coulde bee more agreeable vnto them) they were magnificentlye layde, to cause them in this coniunction to enioye equall reste. Then they erected in token of thys glorious deathe, an Image of Loyaltie, whyche resembled the figure of of Androges , holding in the one hande, a Palme braunche, and in the other, a table of fine golde, wherein was written. A grafte from gracious tree, VVhome Fortune made a king, Both valiaunt, wise, and free. A VVesterne stocke of price, This grafte tooke to his choice, Both vertuous, faire, and wise, In whome he did reioyce. Their perfecte giftes of kinde, Their treasures of grace, Declarde their heauenly minde, And shewde their princely race: Their vertues linckt in one By loyall wedlockes lore, Had freed their mindes of mone, And toyle for euermore. If Enuie had not fraught Two nobles with despight, To bring their blisse to naught, And reaue their hartes delight. By whome, besides their strife For rule by lawlesse way, These Princes loste their life, VVhose loue shall laste for aye. Under this Table was painted a Cocke, and a Doue, which seemed to kill one another, with thys writyng. The mirrour of might, And patterns of Loue, Reste here day and night, And cannot remoue. Beholde the reparation of the offence committed by these desolate people, tearing their garments, their heare, and heartes. Alas what compassion was it to see the Trumpets, Cornets, and Howboyse broken, and all the preparation spoyled whiche was ordeyned for the triumph, and in place of ioyfull Instruments, to heare nothing but cryes and desolate lamentations, and for greene bowes to view flaming torches fuming out wofulnesse. Ah mercylesse death, I knowe not whether I shoulde blame thee for extinguishing this royall light of vertue, the cause of so wonderfull lamentations, or commende thee, that in causing a Iewell despised to be so sorrowed: thou hast made the blind to see, and madde people to knowe their offence (although to their exceeding hinderaunce) and haste enforced them to doe like the mighty Emperour, who wept so bitterly vpon the head of his capital enimie Pompey : Or as did excellent Metellus , who caused his owne children to carry the body of his mortal enimie Segno vnto his graue, honouring him whom he had so deadly hated, shewing that his enimie was mortall. But alas, is it necessarie that vertue should haue so cruell enmitie with Enuy, that to be exempt from hir iniurie, she muste haue recourse vnto death? As the golde when the ruste blemisheth the riche brightnesse thereof, requireth only to be cast into the fire, wheragaynst it hath cheefe power to resist, and by that meane to be reuenged and destroy his aduersarie. Nowe for conclusion, the Englishe Nation bewayled their losse, which they soone perceyued, and immediatly experimented, when the Danes & Normanes , by the ayde of Odo Byshop of Bayon , inuaded the Realme in seuerall partes, and put to exile a great number of the auncient Brytons , who fledde into Britaine in Fraunce , of whom the countrey tooke that name: for Britaine by antiquitie is called at this day Englande. These enimies were in time chased out of the lande, by the power of God, and valure of William surnamed Rufus, seconde sonne vnto the noble king: of whom this historie entreateth, who with his Queene lyeth buried in Caen in Normandie . Thus haue you heard this pityfull Historie (gracious company) whereby you may clearely perceyue my saying to be very true, that the miseries happening in loue, proceede not of harebrayned Fortune, but are conspired by the secrete malice of Enuy, which pursueth hir as the shadowe followeth the body. And if it be not so, let vs a little viewe the practises of this Monster, and with what deceytes it assayled the good happe of our perfect Louers. Principally, could not the king haue liued very well content, and fortunate with his Virginia , atchieued by the force of Loue, and not by force of armes, if the King of Denmarke , prouoked by Enuy, had not bene opposite vnto the weale, whervnto he had neyther title nor interest. And after, had not the king of Englande suppressed the foolishe arrogancie of the Danes by the prouidence of God, if Enuy, seeing hir power vanquished on the one side, had not assayled him on the other, euen where he thought him selfe moste assured, as a ship sinking at the one ende, saueth it selfe a while by the vnequalitie of the ballaunce, making his Subiects enimies to his felicitie, stirring them to turmoyle him, when they should haue giuen him succours and assistaunce. Then as euery one seemed readie to enter into skirmishe, and debate the causes more profoundely, the Lady of the Castell parted the fray vntill the next morning, wherevnto if you please, freendly Reader, we will repayre. The ende of the fourth dayes disporte. wisest of all men, sayde he knewe nothing: And beeing asked any question, would neuer make any assured answer, but without desire to be credited, would say doubtfully, (It is likely) or, (It may be) willing to shewe vs by this modestie, that there is nothing so certayne, but may be very vncertayne, and that men should assure them selues that all things are vnassured and doubtfull: which causeth so many men to be deceyued by their too great assurance, and to buylde vpon this brittle braunche, which men call, to thinke to knowe . So that as Jxion (saye our Poetes, couering the trueth with fictions) thinking to embrace a heauenly Goddesse, embraced but a counterfayte cloude which resembled hir, wherevpon were ingendred the Centaurs : Euen so, suche stande stoutely in their opinion, and vaut they affirme the very truth, whose eyes and vnderstanding beeing opened, perceyue their iudgementes to bee meere vanitie and lyes, whereby are engendred resolutions more absurde, monstrous, and variable, than the dreames of a sicke man. For this cause (say I) I will meruayle no more, though in our Rurall Colledge a question which seemeth so cleare, is so earnestly debated: wherein me thinke we shoulde commende our Nobilitie, whiche will not after the maner of proude Sophisters, answere rashly, to be thereby constrayned to gainsay their arguments, or be proued liers by the veritie: neither after the maner of the scoffer Thales , who beeing demaunded whether the daye or the nighte were firste, aunswered, that the nyghte was before one onelye daye. But as true Phylosophers, they seeke all meanes to finde out the trueth, whiche they searche for their guide, and for feare to be payde with counterfayte coyne, they proue by waygth and sounde the reasons whiche affirme the same. Whom if we seeke so earely, we shall happly finde yet in their beddes, ouerweeried with the wanton disportes which they frequented yester euen after we lefte them. Kowe we then, that they (desirous to take the arrerages of the passed paine, and prouision for the trauayle to come) awaked very late: So as the sunne couered and darkened by obscure cloudes (caused by the former heate) resembled a curtayne to fauour their morning sleepe. And that which gaue them warning to arise, was a little thunder beginning to rumble, by the approche of two contrary qualities conceyued in the ayre (which in Poytou men call Chaline .) Now beeing risen at last with some payne, forsaking their lodgings, their eyes halfe charged with the reliques of sleepe, and halfe with shame of their earelynesse, they gaue the good day to the Lady of the Castell: who had willingly accused their sluggishnesse, but that she perceyued the maydens appareled by halues, seeming as though they had risen before they were awaked, for feare to be last in bedde, which caused all quarels to cease of one parte and other, for the abridgement whereof the Lady ledde them to viewe the halles and galleries of the Castel, where they encountred diuers sortes of pastimes, as the Windball, the barre, fencing, dauncing, tenisplay, vaulting, tumbling, with diuers other exercises which she thought were fitte sawces to get them a stomacke, whereby after the long walkes, they were will recompenced, for the losse of their breakefast, which their long sleepe had stolne away. Nowe bicause the Lady sawe the season euil disposed to disport abroade, and supposed the morning thunder would breede wind, as thunder about noone turneth to rayne, she commaunded the officers to couer for dinner in the Chamber of Venus : for you shall note that euery chamber in the Castell bare the name of one of the goddess, goddesses, or noble Princes of olde time, their colours and properties. This magnificence was sometime imitated (but long agone) and therefore I say, imitated, because it was practized before by the prodigall Romayne Lucullus . Now beeing in this chamber of Venus , wherein all sortes of gallant colours (singing of housebirdes nourished in cages, all sweete odours and other delightes abounded. There the tables were couered, where eche one tooke their place, not without much marueling at the magnificence of the chamber,  & yet more at the seruice: for as in the chamber of the Sunne al the vessels were of golde, and all the moueables therto belonging gylte: And in the Chamber of Mars all things were of corall, and coloured redde: in the chamber of the Moone of siluer, and likewise of the others: So in this of Venus , all was of Christall, vernished with greene, euen vnto the seruitours them selues, who (as they had garments made of purpose) were all apparelled in greene Sattin. To be shorte, all things were so orderlye, as if the Philosopher (that spitted in the Kings face) had beene present, he should haue bene constrayned to spit in his hande, as in the most abiect place. Now beeing all set at the table, the Lady to summon them to make good cheare, taking a cuppe, in smiling, sayd, she dranke to him that had slept best. Then they all thanked hir, demaunding howe they might acquite them with such like payment, as they were bounde vnto hir good graces: But she replied, saying, that she ment to drinke but to one, and would knowe which was he. Nowe eche one auouched him selfe the same: vntill Syr Fleur d'Amour sayd: By the fayth of a sleeper (Madam) in mine opinion, folowing your intent, if this question be truly answered, I assure my selfe the profite and aduauntage thereof shall be mine: for I make account of this worde, best, and (I say) I haue best slept of any heere, not bicause I haue taken longer rest in sleepe, but by receyuing double profite in sleeping, the one of the body, the other of the mind: for so muche as whilest the body rested, the spirite enioyed his true foode, which is learning, perseuerance,  & reuelation of vnknowen things, dreaming a thing so misticall, as it will trouble the most spirituall prophesiers, astronomers, soothsayers, & diuinours, to interprete it. And it was no ridiculous or fantasticall matter, as the toyes which trouble weake brayns ouerpressed with heauy humours, but a matter of importaunce, signifying some thing greatly to be considered: as the Satyre which Alexander dreamed,  & a thousand others specified in holy & prophane authors: for you shall vnderstande (sayd he) vpon the poynt of day, at which time dreames carry most credite, me thought I sawe a great Cage, all couered with diuers flowers and seedes growing about the same of their owne accorde, to feede ye birds of all kinds, which I heard singing therin very melodiously. In this cage was a smal wicket open, out of the which came forth a birde very beautifull in euery perfection, the same repining to be pinned vp, displayed hir wings, and tooke hir flight abrode. But alas, the miserable birde flewe not long, but she alighted hard by in a great Almond tree, hopping from bough to bough: and behold, a gret crow, leane & mishapen, and more ilfauoured than if she had bin scalded in hot water, tooke the little bird in hir talents, and griped it, and made it cry, in such sort, as I thought she had torne it in peeces, and deuoured it: but she only pecked it with hir great beake, & tare away all hir fayre feathers, which when the crow had eaten, became muche more leane & hungry than before. So ye little bird al plumed fell to ye foote of ye Almod tree, mourning piteously, & came hopping fearfully vnto the cage whence it departed so rashly. But as it would haue entred, the other birds not knowing it in this estate, chased it away shamefullye: so the wretched birde not able to flye, was enforced to hide hir selfe vpon the earth, where a venomous serpent came and killed it, and drew it into his denne. Nowe if any one hath the spirite of Joseph , or of Artemidorus , (as Pithagoras , had the spirite of Euphorbeus ) that he may interprete this question, I will esteeme him some Oedipus . In the meane season I require you, beeing iudged to haue slepte beste, that some manne maye geue me the weapon wherewith I was assayled by my Lady. Then was presented vnto him the cup of greene Christal, which done, euery one began to speake his opinion vpon the interpretation of the dreame. One said, the Cage signified Mariage,  & the birde which came out therof a disdainefull Maiden, the Crowe which did eate hir faire fethers, age, the Almonde tree, repentaunce (as witnesseth the impacient Louer, who beeing hanged in his owne gyrdle, was transformed into an Almonde tree) the serpent, death, & the caue the graue. An other by a more hawty and supernatural exposition, construed the cage to be the world, which as in a coffer locketh in it all humaine societies: the bird which of hir foolish motion went out, to be the soule: the crowe to be sinne, which defileth and disfigureth vs: the serpent, for the diuel: the caue, for hell. Another deuined it morally, and euery one according to their seuerall conceite, none otherwise than a cunning Cooke dresseth an egge in seuerall sortes. Wheron they mused so profoundly, and waded so deeply, as I suppose they had bin drowned in their contemplations, if she that shaped the course, had not withdrawen them out of these abstract speculations, declaring vnto the that they were greater dreamers than hir selfe, for she dreamed but in sleeping, and they dreamed waking, and that (which was worst) beeing at the table, fro whence being risen, they walked two or three turnes about the hall, beholding attentiuely the exquisite pictures represented vpon the walles, the ground wherof was of so liuely greene, as it would haue stained the most orient Emeralds. Thervpon wer painted by subtil & laborsome art all sorts of floures, & among the same al kind of birds in their naturall colours, by meanes wherof it would haue moued speeche of gathering nosegayes. Nowe this hall was deuided into two equal partes, wherof the one contained the histories & figures of all suche as had loued happily, the other such as had bin vnfortunate in loue: Of the which euery one carried in a little roll the discourse of their aduentures. And for the separation of these contrary loues, in a corner was edified a throne of so gret magnificence, as it gaue no place vnto that which Phaeton could not behold, whervpo the sun his father sat. Upo this throne was ye Image of Venus in hir glory, holding in hir hand a golden apple: the whole substaunce beeing sustayned vpon one piller, hauing the figure of a man halfe white, halfe blacke, so equally deuided, as his nose was of two colours (such as was seene at Rome , when Torquatus was coronell of the Romaine army) and he helde in his white hand, turned towards the side of the happie louers, a Table, and in the blacke hande turned towards the vnfortunate, an other, conteyning in feminine Rymes. A Goddesse porte hir minde doth craue: If that hir Line be poore and base, No lesse aduauncement would she haue. The yll adorned beautie rare, VVith follies fedde that seeke to see, For gorgeous gaye I doo not care, The modest meane contenteth me. I dye to viewe Dame Chastitie, Acquaynted with simplicitie: The looke that leapes at libertie, Doth hurt my sight exceedingly. Ripe yeres in league with amitie, Yeeldes euer most fertilitie: But youthfulnesse vndoubtedly, Doth lodge delightfull iolitie: I loue the lustie and the lame, The olde no yong I not despise: Of fayre and foule I doe the same, The foolishe please me like the wise. The lauishe toung and silent wight, The smiling cheare and pleasaunt voyce, Doth yeelde my minde alyke delight, And make my heart alyke reioyce. But to be breefe, my flitting loue Doth flye and followe euery chase, Yet nothing can my fancie moue, To stoppe or stay in any place. In ydlenesse and lawlesse life: Among the meanest sort is founde As yll or worse, in mayde and wife. The brauest force the wise to mourne, In viewe of their lasciuious trade, The simple shamelesly do scorne Good warnings by the sages made: The Virgins gallant glauncing eie, Bewrayes hir secreate wanton minde, And Loue in age doth verifie, A barraine stocke by course of kinde: The fruite is sower being greene, And yeeldes a sharpe vnpleasaunt taste, Thus ripe and rotten both are seene, To cloy the stomacke firste and laste: I hate the fatte, I hate the leane, I hate the faire, and eke the soule, The redde, the blacke, the pale and greene I hate, as birdes do hate the Owle: The liuely louing lookes I hate, I hate the simple foolish face, The forced laughter, and the mate, That frames hir song with whoorishe grace, Their fonde delights and lewde offence, I haue so fiercely in disdaine, As doubt dothe daunte my conscience, To thinke where women doe remaine. The whiche Sire de Firme Foy hauing firste discouered: for euerye one was carefully tyed by their eies vnto the paintings, whiche dazeled their sightes with the radiant clearenesse therof, and did more than was the Painters will in representing. All them, whiche looked thereon, braste out in a greate laughter, crying vnto the company: Come, come hither, beholde hym whiche shall resolue the question and disputation, whiche wee haue argued so manye dayes: see here a iudge, whiche cannot be refused, nor suspected, for he is not onely situate in a corner, neither enclining to the one nor the other, but is as white as blacke, fauouring one parte no more than the other. And wherfore shuld we torment oure wittes any further, one vpholding the mishaps of loue, to chaunce by the malice of Fortune: an other maintaining that it commeth of Enuie, enimy to all goodnesse: the third affyrmeth the manne to be the causer thereof: the fourth saith, the woman procureth it, sith that after due information hadde by all the good and euill accidentes, which are happened to all these Louers, the trusty and constant Proctor of Loue, whiche you see here concludeth, that further search needeth not, of the thing remaining in our selues, which are the principall causes of Loue, and causers of all accidentes ensuing therevppon, for Loue being an indifferent passion, whiche taketh hys qualitie bee it good or euill, according to the habitude and disposition of the subiect, which it encountreth,  & by the which it worketh his effectiue operation, neither more or lesse than the eyes lookyng throughe a red, greene, or blewe glasse, vieweth the ayre redde, greene or blewe, without alteration of their proper nature in any poynte. So as a thing may seeme the thing it is not, as these tables shewe vs, affyrming, that all women bee amiable, but none worthye to bee beloued, whyche is so true, than the proofe thereof shall bee very easy vnto mee, if by your fauourable licence I were receyued to interpreate the arrest pronounced sometyme in a redde robe vppon the doubte of Panerge , daring well say, that Loue of it selfe, whych willingly ruleth vs, hathe hindered vs to iudge iustly aswell you Gentlewomen, as also my cousyns. But I that wyll not flatter or bee partiall vnto one partie to oppresse the other: I do say vnder youre correction, that the miseries of Loue. come partely by the manne, and partely by the woman: who in respecte to nourishe, and euer tame it by a delectable coniunction, (whych is the proper nourishment of Loue) do in such sort shorten the lyfe thereof, by discordes, ielousies, mislikyngs, and other poysons of marriage, as they constraine it to dye: wherof wee see daily examples, and for my part I could recite many vnto you. I requyre you (saide the Lady) sith you alone remaine to declare your opinio, the which I suppose you haue retained for the laste course (as the Prouerbe sayth the spice lieth in the bottome) so sweeten oure mouthes. Then stretching foorthe hir hande, shee betoke the nosegaye vnto Sire de Firme Foy , who after thankes and obseruation of accustomed courtesies, seeing euery one placed, after a little silence hee sayde thus. When Auntient Writers wyll cheare vs wyth the fortunatenesse and felicitie that followed menne of the fyrste worlde, whyche they call the Golden Age, among the good conditions and laudable manners whyche they noted in thys holye symplicitye, they neuer forgotte, that the people of thys good tyme menaged and tylled theyr little grounde, neuer losyng the syghte of theyr chimney, neyther cockering themselues wyth suche hardye curiositie, to ride on horsebacke, or beetake theyr lyues to the water in a peece of woodde nayled and bounde togither, to see the fashions of straunge Countryes: So as they thought it good, sith it had pleased Nature to separate one Nation from another, bothe by distaunce of place, and diuersitie of languages, that it was a contradiction vnto hir perfecte ordinaunce, and guiltinesse of rebellion, and agaynste hir Maiestye, when not contente wyth the countrey assigned vnto vs for oure mansion place, euen from oure byrth, wee wyll trauaile the worlde, and by tormenting oure selues to moleste others. And thys opinion hathe beene so deepelye graued in their heartes, as it hathe beene continued from the father to the sonne, and gyuen from hande to hande, as a Caball or hidden secreate. But as a knife hauyng touched the Adamante stone, taketh awaye the vertue therof, and communicateth the same vnto another knife whyche it shall touche, the whiche vertue will soone after faile the fyrste by too long continuaunce from hys originall: Euen so the Latter age (the whyche beeyng but yron hathe verye muche degenerated from hys graundsire) dispenseth wyth it selfe, to imitate thys naturall lawe, and vsing manumission by little and little hath taken libertie to doe somethings more than their Auncestors. So as being wearye of labouring at home, they haue bin desirous to see some nouelties abroade. Nowe this curiositie to see fashions hathe coste them so deare, and made them endure so great paines, as it hathe induced them to commende trauellors exceedingly, placing them in the principall seate of Charitie, and giuing them a seuerall god, for their own safegarde. Wherein they haue yet somewhat reuiued the memorie of the aunciente custome, acknowleging almoste the fault committed against nature: notwythstanding the wisest which haue succeeded, althoughe they haue thought trauaile to disagree wyth nature, yet haue they iudged nothing more worthye in man, than the same, and that it yeldeth hym more excellente than beastes, whiche bouge not from their customarie pastures or plantes, whose foote fastened vnto their maternall soyle, are bounde to remaine alwaies in one place. And they haue thought nothing more commendable for the maintainaunce of humaine societie, than the trafficke and frequentation of straungers, bringyng by communication of proper and peculiar commodities, vtilitie, and profite. So that Histories verifie vnto vs, that Plato, Anacharsis, Pithagoras Solon, Appolonius , wyth an infinite number of excellent Philosophers, traced the world, with greate paines and trauaile to learne wherby they might bee accompted at their retourne, miraculous vnto their nation. But if some pricked wyth thys spurre, haue obteyned the praise of eternall memorie, manye haue loste their tyme and trauayle, reapyng no fruite of their labours, but repentaunce. For euen as among many archers whyche leuell at one marke, scarcelye twoo or three hit the white and cary away the best game: so manye goe to Corinth, but fewe enter in, and of so manye runners, fewe become the richer, makyng rather trafficke for euill, than for good. And principally at thys daye the world is so corrupte, I woulde not hereby that men shoulde returne vnto the lasinesse of the tyme paste, wherin bearded men weare biggins, driueling and dandeling in their mothers lappes, betwene sisters and the chambermaids,  & rode on cockhorse vpon a staffe. Yet am I costrained to blame the foolish estimation, which the most part make of straunge fashions: principally of the Italian toyes, esteeming no manne cunningly cousyned, who beeyng hatched in Fraunce, hathe not beene Italionated by some voyage ouer the mountaines. As the example of two young men testifyeth vnto vs, of whome I will make reporte vnto you, whose maruellous accidentes maye bereaue the credite due vnto a true Historie, if the persons were not, yet liuing, to confirme the matter by their owne testimonie: which shal cause me change their names for the preeminence of their honoure. You shal then vnderstand (honourable company) not long since, in the Citie of Padoua verye famous, aswell for the antiquitie thereof, as for the learned Uniuersitie maintained therein by the Venetians , two schollers grew in acquaintaunce, the whiche (as ordinarily countrymen meeting among straungers) allied their amities so firmely, as they beecame sworne brethren. The one of them was of Poictiers , and the other of Xaintes . These youths by good aduenture hauing mony in banke, were perswaded, it was greate folly for them to study being so farre from home, considering they might as conueniently apply their bookes in their countrey, where the Lattine tongue was as learnedly taught, as in other places. Wherfore it should seeme more commodious for them a while to see the Country, and marke the singularities of Italy in trauailing, as in a place of greate delight, where trauailers drinke the finest wine (considering in time past an army of Gaules passed the mountaines for that cause) to the ende they might tell wonders at their returne home. The which determination was so aptely attempted,  & gallantly executed, as in lesse than sixe moneths, there was no curtesane in the country, but was better knowne vnto them than ye mony in their purses. The which flying with the pleasant passed time, forsooke the company of these knights errant, who wer not so great vsurers, as the Iewes inhabiting the Countrey, mighte grudge at their gaines But alas as al things by the law of natur are subiect to change, Fortune ielouse of this foolish contentment, cut in sunder the path of their pleasures, for whilest they embarqued them in gundelos, to goe see the celebration of the magnificent feaste of saint Marke at Venice , a Poste brought letters vnto the Gentleman of Poictiers (whome wee will call Claribel ) by the whiche his vncle sent for hym in haste, to receiue his inheritaunce, and enter possession of the Patrimony his father enioyed, who within fewe daies hadde exchaunged thys life for another, and hadde discharged the debt, wherevnto Nature hathe bounde all liuing creatures. Who hath seene the shining Sunne sodainelye blemished and darkened by a thicke cloude runnyng hys course vncertaynelye, might well haue discerned the sorrowfull astonishement of Claribel , and for his sake of Floradin (whiche shal be oure Xantogenoys name) when of force they muste omitte their enterprised voiage, wherein they were resolued to playe the wantons, and when mishappe decreed to separate them, whiche was with as greate griefe, as the soule departeth from the body. Notwithstanding, calling to minde the neighbourhoode of their houses, whiche promised shortely a more happy meeting, they comforted their sorrowes with hope. Wherby, embracing, and a thousand adues deliuered, the Poictouin surrendred hys Loue beyonde the mountaines into his companions possession, and warning hym in any wise not to leaue his bearde in Jtaly , he tooke horse: which not being greatly ouerladen with law, by long iorneys brought his Maister to Poictiers , where hee was receyued of al his friendes wyth great ioy. Then after certaine comfortable allegations, for the consolation of his sorrowe touching the deathe of hys father, euery kinsman  & friend practized to mary this new heyre, perswading and shewing him, it was a thing most necessary for the maintainaunce of hys house, wherevnto Claribel in fine consented, sith that it was needeful to be dispatched. Wherfore to entreate of thys marriage, hee employed the greateste lyers that might be founde, hauing euer hearde saye they were fitte menne to worke suche a feate, praying them therin to vse dilligence as for their owne behoofe, being contented wyth their dealing, aswell for the assuraunce hee hadde in the faithfulnesse of his kinsfolkes, as also that he feared not to be deceyued, and that they woulde choose a woman, that at leaste were well to be liked. Thus hadde hee no paine in all thys laboursome trafficke, but to saye yea. The whych was so soone finished, as oure patient meruailed, when deliuery was tendered vnto him. So as after the ioynyng of hands, and bothe partes betrothed according to the manner of the Countrey, Claribel conuerted the sorowe of hys father into the cares of newe housekeepyng, wherein as the custome is, hee immediatelye beganne to reforme hys manner of vsage, counterfaityng a sufficient and resolued staye, wythdrawing hymselfe from foolishe companye, onelye frequenting hys familiar affaires: To be short, hee tooke newe aduise and deliberation for the ordering of hys presente estate, and life to come. So as seeing hymselfe well furnished wyth money, aswel by his succession, as by his marriage, he purposed to sue for a Counsellors promotion: and to this effecte, he vndertooke a iourney to the Courte, makyng assured accompte, that hauyng his dispatche, he woulde remaine some tyme at the greate Chamber barre, to see howe other behaued them there, and learne to imitate theyr good example. Notwithstanding hee stucke not to sweare vnto hys newe wife, that hee woulde retourne very shortely. Nowe leaue wee oure newe married manne riding to Paris , whereas other men accustome to visite their vncle when they determine to take truce for a time with their amorous trauailes,  & let vs returne into Jtaly , to see the demeanor of good Floradin , where we shal finde hym wyth hys Maistresse, ending his harueste, althoughe hys pouche pinched, for hys olde acquaintance gaue hym suche credite, as he felt not his feathers limed: assuring himselfe, that the letters hee hadde gyuen hys companion Claribel to deliuer vnto his father, were not without vertue, but woulde hee as medicineable, as the strongeste Ruberbe, to purge the purse of the good olde manne. Who hauing receiued them, sente worde vnno hys sonne, that hys pleasure was, that hee shoulde come home, thinkyng it was hyghe tyme, considering the space hee hadde frequented the Uniuersitie, where hee oughte to haue profyted exceedingly. Wherefore commaunding him to returne into Fraunce, to the ende he might always see some noueltie, he aduised him to take Valentia, Burges , and Poytiers in his way homewarde. Where if he thought any commoditie were to be reaped, he was well contented, his sonne should spende some time to reuiue his studies vnder the excellent Charles the wise, the myrrour of his age, by whose inuention and workmanshippe the worthy Chronicles of Frauce (which are at this day) were composed, hoping that by hearing suche a peerelesse person, his studious minde might by his learned instructions, receyue the pleasure whiche a Trauayler taketh, viewing as in a Card, the true description of all the places he hath passed through. The whiche was willingly executed by the obedient sonne, and that with suche diligence, as he had no leysure to paye his creditours, with whome he playde Banckrupt. I beleeue they would willingly haue remitted the interest and forfeyture, to haue receyued their owne due debt, whiche they attended with many a long looke. Our Floradin beeing arriued at Poytiers , to shewe that he had trauelled countreys, determined to play the smelfeast: saying, studie was a fitte practise for ignoraunt persons: wherfore the thing that pleased him beste, was to haunt feastes and dauncings, where he learned the cunningest masters, howe to daunce galliards,  & pauins, and all other measures. Then within a whyle he made choyse among the brauest Dames, of one whom he esteemed moste worthy of his seruice: for it seemed more difficill vnto him to liue without loue, than without meate. Touching the scholes, he visited them, onely to knowe where they stoode, and howe they were buylt, contenting himselfe with the names of the Doctours in his tables, to the ende he might talke of them if he were demaunded what they were. Nowe beeing one daye at a Banquet in one of the moste notable houses in the towne, he had good leysure to beholde at hys pleasure the beauties, wherewith you shall vnderstande thys Citie is very populous, and very richely furnished: where seeing his fancie at choyse, he was sore troubled, for if one pleased him for hir flourishing youth, an other lyked him no lesse by demonstration of hir rype flower ready to be plucked, then sodaynely his minde commended an other I knowe not howe, sugering hir gestures with such a grace, as he thought nothing well done, but onely that which was done by hir. To be short, his ambicious loue coueted all, but this great riches made him poore, taking from him in so great choyse all power to choose. But in fine, as a Butterflie flickering from floure to floure, if it be caught by a childe that finely followeth after it, hath his gylded wings so wasted awaye, as it remayneth in the open hande without power to flee any more: so this Louer layde in the lappe of Damoysels (with whom in a small time he became familier inough) not beeing very vneasie to tame, neuerthelesse without passing the limittes of decentnesse, and bicause he was not vntaught and ignoraunt to practise the good graces of the most disdainefull, tooke an ouersighte all at pleasure of these beauties, when as a Damoysell discharging a glaunce of hir minion eye, vnder a smiling, sufficient ynough to chaunge raynie cloudes into fayre weather, depriued his wandering loue of all libertie to raunge any further, and from that time retayned him so strictly, rauished in the contemplation of hir good graces, as he had no more any pleasure, but by pitifull regardes to summon this beautie to redouble the mortall stroke, & finishe the ende of his life. Whereby it happened, that by this encounter of pearcing lookes, as by the shocke of two Flintes, there sprang a sparke, which finding a heart of Sulphure in the Gentlemans breast, kindled all at once. Ah infortunate Floradine , howe lauishe haste thou beene of thy youthfull affections, but yet I accuse more thy misfortune, whiche hath appoynted thee a place so daungerous and vnmeete. For alas, could it chaunce worse vnto thee, than to burne so paciently in the loue of hir, whiche the amitie of thy friende Claribel oughte to haue rendered so hollye and vnuiolable, as nowe thy onely thought ought to be nominated and called sacriledge among friendes. Knowe thou vnhappie man, knowe (I saye) that she whome thou louest so feruently, belongeth vnto thy Claribel , who yet feeling the ioyes of hir marriage, hath left nothing in hir coffer that might aduauntage hir naturall beautie, and hath yet within the alabaster of hir cheekes, the vermillion spotts which she attayned by the exchaunge of hir virginitie (the remedie of pale colours) not hauing neuerthelesse thereby loste as yet hir accustomed place among Maydens, nor forgotten the wanton lookes of a young virgin. The passioned Louer discontented to viewe onely the thing, the sight whereof was so domageable vnto him, sought all the meanes possible to court his newe Mistresse, to receyue by the mildnesse of hir sweete toung a remedie for the wounde which the rigour of hir eyes had made. knowing that there is no phisicke which can heale the blemishe that one eye giueth to another. Nowe whatsoeuer this carefull Louer proued to doo, there was no other comoditie for him at this time, but that which the departure of the company yeelded him: for then he arose, and beeing in a readynesse, he atchieued the meane to conduct his Lady, where he was not so fortunate as he expected: for so muche as not beeing alone together, but hauing for witnesse a kinsman of hirs, who helde hir by the other arme, he had not oportunitie to declare by words that his eyes in their secrete language had before vttered vnto hir. So deuising of matters somewhat different from the purpose, they ariued with easie walking at the Gentlewomans lodging, where he was forced to take his leaue. Then she thanked the Gentleman of his vndeserued payne: wherevnto he answered with a wandering eye, Ha Mistresse, if I were so happie to be in place where I might shewe by experience (as I desire) what portion your good graces haue obtayned in me, you would say, that this benefite and fauour which I nowe receyue (the which as though you ought me displeasure) you call payne, is to me the least part of the duetie which bindeth me to doo you seruice. Then seeing he was pressed to depart, not daring to presume any further, he griped hir hande in such sort, as she for an aunswere behelde him with so quicke and daungerous an eye, that at this departure eche one carried away the secrete markes of a mutuall affection. Thus their bodies beeing parted by the enuie of the nighte, (for their spirites were soo straightly ioyned to be separated) Floradin enquiring of his hostesse what suche an one was, lodged in suche a place, vnderstoode she was a young Damoysell newly maried vnto a towneborne childe, who by occasion of his fathers death was returned, I knowe not from howe farre, where he studied, as men sayde: and assoone as he had wedded this mayden, was gone to seeke a Councellers office. Sodenly by the answere of the olde woman, Floradine coniectured easily, that for certayne this newe married man was his friende Claribel , who hauing enherited the Lordeshippes of his deceased father, was nowe called Master Font d'argent . So without semblant that he knewe him, he made hir tell him from poynt to poynt, what manner of man he was, howe the marriage was made, and to be short, al that he could imagine, vntill it was bedtime. Where the pensiue louer wished earnestly for some olde Sibilla , to resolue him of a thousande doubtes, which dulled his gyddie braynes,  & made his eares deafe to al reason that would dissuade him from his errour. In suche wise, as like a shippe encombered with two contrarie winds, that furiously contende which of them shall haue the masterie: Nowe he cursed his veluble desires, which had caried him vpon their wings to the top of an vnaccessable Rocke, wherevpon it was impossible to inhabite, and that which is worse, from whence no man coulde deuise to get downe. Then he praysed his happie destiny, which had prouided him a place of such aduauntage, where he knew to be wel setteled: Alas (sayd he) to what extremitie am I brought that newe loue must needes destroy olde amitie, constrayning me to lose him, vnto whom so many pleasures haue bounde me, yea to destroy my selfe without any assuraunce of profite, or to atchieue vnto the attaynt of those that loue, which is fruition. For (sayd he) these Poyteuins giue men curteous entertaynment, without euer passing any further, and make them hope for that they neuer giue: but the most part of such as are better broken vnto loue, performe without any word more than they promise. Sodenly the same mouth which said these words, with repetace spake the contrary, scoffing and ashamed at the slender courage which he had to finishe the thing, whose happy beginning promised a lucky ende, a thing indeede, which deserued to be obtayned with some trauaile. For (saide hee) if Fortune being equall, or rather the simpathy and vnion of like naturall affections, hathe appointed my friende and me to loue one bodye, I oughte not to meruaile: for where there is a stricte coniunction of mindes, the one cannot be molested wyth anye passion, but the other must feele the same by a secrete constrainte: neither ought I to thinke therby to doe wrong or violence vnto friedship, sith ye firste lawe thereof is, that all things shoulde be common among friends, which shal be the cause yt of this communication must needes ensue confirmation of amitie, and of this corporall alliance, the vnion of mindes shall be enforced. Nowe if our Floradin wer tormented on the one side and the other by diuers imaginations, the Gentlewoman made no better market: and bycause this newe griefe was vnknowne vnto hir (for althoughe hir parentes had maried hir body, yet was shee not wedded in minde and will, neither hadde yet learned what it was to loue) it was the more grieuous and importune vnto hir. So that turning and tossing hither and thither in hir widowishe bed, as thoughe shee had laine vppon burning coales, or vppon pricking tazells, shee complained to hirselfe: O God (saide shee) what enimy is this of my reste, which hath so strangely bewitched me at this feast, as I cannot nowe sleepe, but with open eies, plunged and drowned in the bottomlesse pitte of care? Alas, I knowe well nowe this my mischiefe is occasioned by my manifolde aspectes: but that whiche moste martireth my minde, is to suffer so greate griefe for his auaile, whose presence contented me so delightfully, and absence tormenteth me so fiercely. Ah mine eies, why are you so harmefull vnto me, as I hadde bene better to haue beene blinde borne. And you my hearte, wherefore haue yon beene so tender and feeble? oughte you to haue subiected youre selfe vnto these imaginations? why hathe not Nature steeled my breaste to blunte the pointes of these amorous passions? Alas, wherefore hath hys faire hear, so out of order, and carelesly kembed, pleased me too muche? And why hadde his open and free face so great grace to winne me. Wel, sith an olde sore is vneasie to be healed by any present remedie, I must in time cutte this amorous webbe from the loume, the which hauing shackeled me in these fonde desires, would make my life miserable, and defame my honour. And should I not then be too euill aduised; to commit a thing so precious vnto one vnknowen? sith that these Gnattes are accustomed to vaunt themselues ordinarily of things very vntrue, searching honour by the losse of womens good renowne? Thus the desolate gentlewoman made reckning to bolt the dore agaynst this new loue. The which (as a Snake hauing his tayle troden vpon, rayseth his head to sting the foote that pressed him) fretted at this rebellious Dame, and placing the courteous qualities and conditions of hir seruaunt, before the eyes of hir fantasie, constrayned hir to gaynsay all she had spoken. It is very true (sayd she) if there be any creature for whom any man ought to doo any thing, this man deserueth it. Ah my friend, would to God you had come sooner, or neuer: but alas, you are come to late, and an other hath reaped thy hope: Alas, another deceyuing thee, hath taken that which was thy due: one (I say) who weerie of our youthfull disportes, is gone to solace him self some otherwhere, enioying the priuiledges, which men, ordeining the lawes, haue giuen themselues, taking licence to doo the thing which they so straightly forbid vs: wherin thoughe I bee wronged, yet God suffer mee not to beginne the playnt, and rather let the earth swallowe me into hir bottomlesse dennes, than (my precious Chastitie) I shoulde euer consent to thy ruine. Alas I doubt not but some beautifull minion woulde esteeme hir selfe very fortunate to gather the graine which I reiect, and enioy the benefite I refuse: But I consent that one whom shame wrongeth not (as me) may embrace that which pertaineth vnto me, and I willingly resigne my pretended right, to learne in my despight, and with greate trauell, to refuse the thing I moste desire. Alas difficultie (as experience teacheth) hath made me esteeme vertue, and abstayne from the delight which pleaseth me. But cursed be such vertue, as maketh me fall into ingratitude, and to be vniust: for I knowe, in dooing it, I punishe not onelye my selfe, but shall doe him wrong, who well deserueth some good intreatie, worthy of his violent and sincere loue, which he had gladly disclosed vnto me, if time and place had fauoured his intent. But of the slender recompence thou receyuedst, deare friende, thou oughtest not to accuse my rigour and crueltie, for I loue thee. Alas who would not loue thee? truely I loue thee so well, that agaynst mine owne desire, I wish thy good Angell maye dissuade thee from thy purchase, without suffering thee to linger any longer in losse of thy time. Alas, consider how I become mine own enimie, in being too friendly vnto thee and resisting my proper forces, I betray mine owne weale. Wherfore thou oughtest to accuse thine vnfauourable fortune, which hath landed thee in so vnlucky a port, lodging thy desires in one, who would willingly vse them well,  & requite them worthily, if she were not so rude and vnlearned in that facultie, so as you must take by force the thing she would without delay haue giuen you. As after a lightning thunder, whiche threatneth with sparkling fire to conuert ye worlde into ashes, in fine we see the rage of the whole heaues dissolue and poure downe in violent flouds of raine: So forcible loue hauing thundred, lightned, and practised his ful power to consume the tender hart of this Dame, constrayned hir by this hot alarme, to poure out the bitternesse of hir soule, by the distillation of teares from hir eyes, vntill the breake of day, whiche bringeth vnto mankinde a beginning of trauels, ministred vnto hir solitarie minde occasion of rest. Then drawing hir weerie armes out of hir bed one after another, she called hir chambermayd oftentimes. But let vs leaue this Gentlewoman vpon arising, least we should thinke hir very long in attyring, and with your fauour returne towards our Floradine , who hauing well debated the matter alone, at last resolued to sounde the watche, and enterprise to obtayne hir (as men say) by foote or wing: So as the Mariage, in respect to alter his minde, nowe emboldened his courage, and seemed vnto him a fayre courtayne to couer loue, whom Painters portraite naked. And to nourish his good hope, he called to memorie the Italian prouerbe, Col'tempo & la paglia, si matura la mela: videlicet , with time and strawe men make melowe apples. Nowe the time seemed long vnto him, as the thing exceedingly expected lingreth alwayes very muche, but touching the paines it had bene nothing, if he had reaped any benefite thereby: but the moste parte was in vayne, bycause he coulde neuer meete his Mistresse, although oftentimes he passed and repassed of set purpose before hir gate, where (it seemed) he ought euery daye one iourney at the least for his rent. Wherefore it happened, for the reliefe of his losse and labour, and ease of his weerie walkes, he founde meanes to hire a lodging right ouer agaynst hir house, making his account it coulde not be possible, but he should see hir one time or other, playing alwayes the vigilant espie. Beeing there, he fayled not euery euening to watche at his Chamber windowe (which fronted his Mistres lodging) where taking his Lute, whereon he played very sweetly, he constrayned the strings pitifully to complayne their Masters loue, and oftentimes he entermedled therewith a song, so pityfull and languishing, as I knowe not whether the harmonie of the voice, or cunning of the hande were most commendable, they agreed so melodiously together. Wherewith no doubt, the tender heart of the Damoysell was maruellously moued to pitie: for it was of force to mollifie the harde rocke. But she so enforced hir selfe with hir whole power, as she durst not shewe vnto hir impacient friende, the good she wished him in will. And I doubte whether hir payne were greater in supporting hir loue, or in hir cunning concealing therof. Wherby Floradine halfe in dispaire, beganne one euening to tune his accustomed instrument, wherevpon he song this Sonet, vsing the Italian accent very cunningly, with comely gesture: Dame Beautie pearelesse wight, the mother of my greefe, Sith thou in suche dispight disdaynest my releefe: I doo repent me sore I so pursude thy grace, I will doe so no more, Ile hunt an other chase. I will go arme me sure agaynst that glaring eye, Whose smiling gleames procure the meanes to make me dye. Yea I will stoppe mine eare agaynst the fayned speache, VVhose suttle sound I feare, will be my mortall leache. Ile shunne the curled locks, which in a Net of golde, Hath meshed me with mocks, that make my hart full colde. The snowishe Lilly brest, full fraught with louely lore, Shall lose of me a guest, I will byde scorne no more. But will renounce the sight that drownes me in desire, And boyles me day and night in flames of quenchlesse fire. And henceforth search the way, to liue in libertie: VVill works to voyde delay, but loue will not agree. Then after a little pause, renewing his complaint, he turned him towards ye house wherin his loue was imprisoned, saying: The fierie skies doe, not at all times flame The thunder threats not still the earth belowe, Nor Ycie frost doth alwayes bruse the same, Not euery houre colde blustering blasts do blowe: Dissentious seas, holde not continuall strife, Ne dunker night, doth alwaies shade oure life. But my debates for euermore and aye, My passions eke approue your force and might, Batter to earthe this iellous wall I saye, That lockes from me my treasure and delight, I thinke my ioyes and harte consumde with mone, For aye shall lodge within this rocke of stone. Like vnto me I viewe no louer pine, VVith happy ioy they all do ende their paine: Yet loue I more than they thy face diuine, VVithin whose hearte no pittie doth remaine, My maistresse is more mercilesse and nice, Than thunder, nighte, the sea, the winde, or yce. Nowe as it is vnpossible, but in many daies a manne shall encounter one good houre, hee happened one morning to espie his frowarde friende, who possible was willing to be seene of hir louer, what displeasaunte countenaunce soeuer shee fained, as she was kembing hir faire heare at the open window of hir chamber, the naturall golde whereof glistered againste the radiant Sunne beames. And after he had giuen hir good morrowe, besought hir she woulde not shutte the windowe, as shee proffered, and that in recompence of suche fauoure, he would sing a song for hir loue. Then hee tooke his Lute, and warbling the strings with tenne thousand delicate diuisions, hee beganne to saye. No forte or castell builte by force to feare the foe, No welth that surging seas do yeld by sayling, won with wo, No garden of delight compilde by cunning hande, No precious iewels to be found by serch in Leuant sande. No sumptuous dainty feastes of rich and puisant kings, No pastymes with companyons, that companie oft brings, No merie table talke, no Histories of fame, No perfumes of Arabia , that Foelix men do name. No ioy in meddow walkes, no shade of wildesome wooddes, No melody of chaunting birdes, that chirpe with mery moodes, No whispering water course, of siluer shallowe becke, No fragrante fruites, that Sommer dothe with Autumns riping decke, Nor all the worldly wealth, that radiant sunne doth see Are of such price, as any heare of my deare Dame to mee. Behold then (said he) deare Maistresse, what outrage your rigor shuld induce me vnto, by shutting your window so sodainly, and enuiouslye to couer the Paradice of youre good graces, the syghte whereof, amazeth mee wyth greate meruaile: for what auayleth greate treasure I praye you, if it remayne continuallye buryed couetouslye in the Earthe? and what harmonye yeeldeth the instrument, whose sounde is neuer hearde? euen so what price beareth the beautie alwaies hidden? dothe it not lose the glorie and estimation it deserueth? Alas, were it not better to receyue the seruice of a loyall feiende? Wherto the Damoisell aunswered: Ah Syr, I knowe verye well by the small perseueranece whyche is in mee, that the tale you haue tolde, tendeth more to youre aduauncement, than to my commendation, wherein you shewe howe greatelye you would esteeme a beautie worthy of your praises, sith in mee, in whome there is nothing, you fynde matter of accompte, esteeming a heare to bee of suche value, as it seemeth you leaue nothyng for the reste of the bodye, whyche is more worthe. Wherein you haue surpassed the glorie of hym that so muche esteemed a Flye, or the Trumpette that sounded suche fame of Frogges. But what? from a person full of praise, nothing canne proceede, but praises. Nowe after manye preatye deuises, gyuyng eche other from farre the Besalos manos , they tooke their leaue: from thenceforth Floradine entered into many ioyfull motions, whiche reuiued more and more, the nexte euening, where in passing by, hee found hir sitting at hir gate, and by good oportunitie caughte a snatch at hir corrall lippes, in memorie whereof, that night hee song vnto hir a louely gratulation, in these verses. I did requyre of late this onely boune of Loue, For recompence of al my paine, my slender sute to moue, And that he woulde vouchsafe, for comforte of my woe, I might but licke the sugred lips, fro whece my grief did floe, My sute was graunted soone, to take it passing by, Oh luckelesse daye, wherein, I did enioye suche amitie, For then mine eies deprivde, of power to see their weale, Enuide my mouth possessing, his sweete contented heale: Loue, thou haste nothing done, to cheare my pensiue minde, Thy former gifts within me breeds, an other war I finde, VVhiche forceth me alas, to enuy mine estate, That I shoulde be enforste by thee to curse my crooked fate. Sith then one dainty bit, cannot two gluttons fill, I pray thee Loue, haue some remorse, vnlesse thou wilt mee kills And either take againe, my first possessed parte, Or giue me more, that better may, contet my faithful hart. But why staye wee so long vpon this difficulte foundation of Loue? Knowe we nowe that oure Floradin , who was no nouice in this monasterie, deuised for the accomplishement of hys pretence, which way hee might certifye his maistresse how much he was hirs. And Loue, who is a wise maister, taught him a verye expedient mean, which was this. Unto ye house of this getlewoman ordinarily frequented (as it is an auntient custome in good houses) a prieste, yt which either for extreame age, or bycause he had not often drunke water, failed sight to conduct him, nor could scarcely reade his portuis and breuiarie: Neuerthelesse, his eies wer cleare inough for Floradins purpose, who fell into such familiar acquaintance with ye olde man,  & had so great deuotion vnto him, as needs he would haue him heare his confession: wherein after hee had vttered certaine veniall sins in his eare, he added thereto, that he had a scruple whiche charged his conscience, viz. that a bonde of an hundreth crownes was remayning in hys hande, althoughe hee were well and truelye payde and satisfyed of the whole summe, which was greate wrong vnto him that hadde so honestelye discharged the same: Wherefore for the disburthening of hys soule, hee desired to render it vnto one named Sire Fount d'Argent , vnto whome it pertained. Iesu, howe well this geare goeth my sonne (said the Priest) (although it be an iniurie to bee called a Priestes sonne.) I knowe verye well the man wyth whome you haue to deale, hee is not at thys instante in the towne, but hee hathe here a good Liefetenaunte, whyche is hys wife. Wherevnto oure conscionable Floradin replied, drawing a paper out of his bosome: I beseech you then giue this vnto hys wife, and excuse me, if you please, towardes hir, that I broughte it not my selfe vnto hir. The whiche, the olde man perfourmed verye faithfullye, going forthwith vnto the Gentlewoma, whom he found at conuenient leysure for he purpose: vnto whome hee made description of the young manne, who was in question, what apparell he hadde, and what coloured liuery hys lackey ware: but it was no neede to delyuer so manye notes of knowledge vnto hir that hadde marked hym so well, who immediatly doubting what the matter was, could not refraine from blushing, and thanking the messenger courteouslye, saide: Truly beholde the signe of a good conscience (whiche is harde to bee founde in those yeares you speake of) or a token of greate amitie towardes the maister of the house: and I woulde willingly knowe hym in whome my husbande hath reposed so greate truste, to giue him thankes in his behalfe, wherfore I praye you cause me to speake with the young man after Euensong. So they ended their talke: And the goodman taking his leaue, departed, not failing to meete Floradin in his way, who watched hys commyng oute, yet made semblante as hee thoughte nothing vppon hym. Unto whom hee sayde, that the Gentlewoman not contented to thanke him by attorney, would in person gratifye hys courtesie. Wherefore shee prayed him to be at the Parishe Churche after euensong tyme, by such a piller, where the Gentlewomans pew was. The which so displeased the patient, that whereas the time of appointment was after Euensong, he became so deuoute, as hee was there three houres before. In the meane time, the Damoysell withdrew hir into hir chamber, not without commendation of hir seruantes inuentiue gueste, and bolting hir chamber dore fast, shee opened the paper, and read thys sequele. Mistresse , sith it is a common thing to sicke menne, to bemone their griefe, (whereby they receiue some ease) the torment whiche I endure, shal of good right excuse my iust complainte: althoughe I knowe not well on whome to exclame, either againste Loue, who handeleth me so hardelye, or againste my selfe, who haue preserued my selfe by the will of my destiny vnto these mischiefes, that I can neither obtaine the maistery of mine affections, nor of your excellent beautie, the perfections whereof are so mighty, as there is no fortresse or rampire of Constancie, whiche is able to wythstande the batterye thereof. The whiche maketh me easyly to pardon my weakenesse, that hathe yeelded vnto the mercie of that, whose rigor might grieuouslye haue punished mine obstinacie, if I had made resistance: and nowe promiseth me by hir lenitie, the grace which the vanquished oughte to expecte of the pitifull conqueroure. Nowe vnder the fauoure of this good hope, I defende my languishing againste the assaultes of a thousande deathes (whiche continuallye hadde me at the baye) for the onelye desire it maye serue you as a thing, whyche the Heauens hathe vowed vnto you alone, and wherof you haue taken entire possession, according to youre ryghte, from the firste daye whyche gaue me knowlege of you. The whych I know not if I ought to esteeme, fortunate hauyng vowed mine affections, and planted them in a place so commodious, or rather vnfortunate, hauing conducted mee into suche a Sea of sorrowes, wherein I cannot long floate, but I shall sincke, if you (maistresse) stirre not my leake vessell vnto the healthfull hauen of youre good graces. He, whiche will you, nill you, is resolued to die the seruaunt of your beauty, Floradin . Who hathe viewed in the Spring time, raine, and Sunneshine in one moment, might beholde the troubled countenaunce of the gentlewoman, after she had read, and ouerread the letters of hir Floradin wyth an eye, nowe smilyng, then bathed in teares, whome hearing the Belles ring all in, shee wente to fynde, leaning agaynste the Piller adioynyng to hir Pewe, who at hir commyng, entred into dyuers perturbations of mynde, so as bothe hee and shee rauished wyth extreame gladnesse, remayned long tyme dumbe, as if they hadde bin some Sainctes of the Parishe, vntill that Floradin , perceyuyng hys long attendaunce, so well recompenced, and that hys duetye nowe commaunded hym to beginne the quarrell, drawing neare, bycause hee woulde not remayne restie in so faire a waye, wyth a softe and vncertayne voice, (hee sayde:) Ha Maistresse, if I hadde beene so happye, as you hadde knowne but the leaste torment, whyche maketh mee to endure, in wishyng therevnto too muche goodnesse, I shoulde not haue beene troublod nowe in requyring youre fauoure, enforcing my feeble forces consumed by the fyre (ennimye of my lyfe) whiche proceedeth oute of youre beautiful eyes, but hadde nowe receyued as conuenient comforte to heale, as you haue beene cruell to hurte hym, who neuer deserued suche entreatie vnlesse you conster hys vnfained affections for fickle fantasie. The whiche shall neuer be pardoned, for I can neuer repente them. Wherevnto the Gentlewoman setting a share the windowes of brute shame, aunswered: I know not (Sir) what moueth you to complayne of mee, excepte you feare I shoulde fyrste begynne, hauyng muche greater occasion, beeyng circumuented by you wyth letters, bearing a false tytle of obligation, wherein, faining by scoffes to acquite you, you haue bounde and charged youre selfe with greate rashenesse. Menne saye, suche warriours, as will winne a towne, fyrste seeke to knowe the force thereof, and approche neare vnto it, entrenching their Campe, then they beginne to plante their battery, to make some breach, whiche done, they proceede to the assault. But you, without anye preparatiue durste assaile the fortresse of mine honoure, I knowe not from whence proceedeth this hardinesse, but onely of some presumptuous opinion you haue of youre selfe, for certaine aduantages, whiche nature hath happilye bestowed on you, where wyth some simple soule, yea in good faith my selfe might be ouerreached, but that I know whatsoeuer you speake fantasticallye, you are not so blinde, to conceiue in me anye thing worthy of Loue. But you woulde willingly make me beleeue it, that afterwardes (as you haue the reporte) you maye deuise and triumph amongs youre companions of my folly, which causeth me to mortifye in my selfe, the opinion I might haue conceiued of you, the which in time might haue taken rooting. For be you assured, a drop of ynke blotteth not so much the white paper, as vaunting staineth Loue. Alas Maistresse, replied Floradine , if you thinke I haue bin too hastie in the purchase of your good graces, it is not bycause I haue not well tried if continuaunce of tyme, which consumeth all things, would waste  & coole my feruent heate: for (I demaund your pardon therfore) I haue vsed mine vttermost cunning to refrayne youre Loue, but as the fier blowed easyly, to the end to quench it, kindleth with aduantage, eue so more & more ye brand flameth which consumeth me by the resistance I haue made against it, so as of force I must repaire vnto ye phisition, & enforme you by letters of my griefe, which blush not, as I shuld haue done. Wherwith I haue bin so oppressed by the force of my torment, as you neede not to be astonied, if I haue not obserued the orders & vses, which you require, & which they keepe ordinarily that Loue by arte to deceiue others. And I beleeue maistresse, you are perswaded it is not hatred that I beare you, whiche hathe made mee enterprise so muche. Wherefore, if you bee a righteous Iudge, you wyll not accuse anye other thyng, than the inuincible power of youre beautye, whiche burneth me wyth so couerte a fier, as if my hearte were laide naked to your viewe (whiche cannot chance tyll after my death) I would neuer require other witnesse of my faithfull loue than onely you. Furthermore, I pray god I neuer false my faith towards you, by any lewd vauting, wherwt you wrogfully accuse me. And althogh you haue suf sufficiet power & auctoritie to punish mee, so it is (dere Maistris) that I sweare to you by youre beautifull eies, whyche haue blinded mine, that I will rather consent to be a miserable banished vagabonde out of youre fauoure (whiche is the greateste mischiefe to me of al others) than by so wicked courage I should make suche sacrifice of youre honoure, in defence whereof, I esteeme a thousand liues well employed. And I assure you henceforth, my constancie shall reuenge the iniury your tong hathe done vnto it, and shal make it repent at leysure. During these speaches, Loue, which laye in ambush, bathed hys wings in the teares of our Louer, and dryed the in the broyling breast of the Gentlewoman: who from minute to minute, was so vanquished with compassion, as treading all feare vnder foote, and clasping close the hande of hir Floradin , shee saide vnto hym: My friende, I knowe not where to finde faith, if I faile thereof at youre hande, but the meane of longer conference and conclusion, is cut off by the company already assembled here. Wherefore we will deferre the reste vntill euensong be ended. O Loue, howe greate are thine inuentions, whereof thou giuest practise to such as thy pleasure is to choose for thy seruice? And how gret is thy power to blesse such as it pleaseth thee? Thou arte serued with sacred persons in holy places, and nowe thou wilte be serued with sanctifyed things. For you shall vnderstande (gratious companye,) that at the end of euensong, the Damoysell making a signe to hir supplyaoute, (who had alwayes an eie to the wood) shee saide vnto hym: Holde here my Prayer booke, and faining you founde it by my forgetfulnesse and ouersight, bring it vnto my house after supper. Uppon thys determination oure Louers parted companye, wyth so greate contentment, as they receiue, whiche enioye the halfe benefite for whiche they hope. In the meane season, the Gentlewoman practized for the conducting of hir Loue, hir Chambermaide (whom wee wil name Radegonde , bycause it is moste exquisite in thys place) who hauing beene nourished and broughte vppe wyth hir, was (as one of hir creatures) bounde to bee faythfull and secreate vnto hir. In the motion whereof shee was no niggarde of fayre promises for recompence of hir duetye. The whyche the the Mayden (wyth a good wyll) promised willinglye, and executed so cunningly, as watchyng the tyme when the Louer shoulde come, she receyued hym at the open gate verye courteously, teaching him vnder couert wordes a good parte of his duetie, the whiche he knewe verye well howe to rewarde, and was not slacke to giue hir a golden penye to buy pinnes. Then she led him into the hall, to see hir Mistresse, whiche was accompanied with a good olde Gentlewoman, hir Aunt of S. Angely , (whom I pray the company to marke well, because we must remember hir hereafter) the same was come to the mariage of hir Neece, where a little sicknesse had retayned hir vntill then. Nowe Floradine after courtesie and reuerence done and receiued at his entraunce, recited the cause of his comming, which was, to restore the little booke found in suche a place, the which he vnderstoode to be the pewe of the Gentlewoman: who after she had shewed some abashment, thanked the Gentleman a thousande times. Then hauing entreated him to sit downe, they began to talke of diuers matters: but aboue the rest Floradin vttered the olde friendly familiaritie which had passed betweene M. Font d'argent , and him, the which brought him greatly in the bookes of the olde Aunte, who for this occasion requested him to come often vnto the house of his auncient friende and companion, whose absence should be no hinderaunce of his welcome. The whiche Floridine promised, so that his frequentation were not to any noysome (knowing that loue oftentimes is clad in the cloke of amitie, thereby the better to enter into acquayntaunce.) Thus they communed together so long, that the night constrayned Floradine , (after the collation) to take his leaue, fearing least his first arriuall should be by importunacie yrkesome to age. So after great thanks he departed, beeing conducted to the doore, by the young Gentlewoman, where she betooke this prisoner in garde vnto hir chamber mayde, who well instructed howe to bestowe him, conuayed him through a priuie gallerie into a gardeyne (wherewith this towne is well furnished for the inhabitants commoditie:) In this little earthly Paradise the fortunate Louer beeing left by his guide (who went to order other matters) attended in an armour his wished weale. And blessing the trees and hearbes of this delicious place, beseeched their fauourable ayde, to haste awaye their Mistresse. Alas (sayde he) Sorcerers by your vertue and swete verdure, haue power to drawe the Moone out of the heauens for the performance of their wicked coniurations: it is not so vneasie (O hearbs) to leade by your secret force a faire creature into this accustomed place, to fauour the sincere intent of a faithfull louer. Display then now all your power to succour me, and in recompence of your fauours, the milde heauens embrace you with their honey dewes, and graunt that the snayles and cankers may neuer destroy your tender beautie. During these discourses, the Gentlewoman secretly solicited with the remembraunce of hir attendaunt, debated in hir minde what was best for hir to doo. Nowe propounding what foolishe rashnesse she attempted, yeelding hir honour in praye to one vnknowen, who making so cheape a market, should happly be constrayned to repent of his enterprice. Then pricked on by loue, presenting in hir minde the glorious gayne, which was prepared for hir rewarde, esteemed all difficultie vnworthy to hinder so greate a benefite. When hir chambermayde blamed greatly hir long abode, whereby armed with hardie feare, appareled in hir night dressing, and hir night gowne, so for hir aduauntage, as a man would haue taken hir for one of Dianas Nimphes, strayed from hir company of hir fellowes, she marched softly, and vnassuredly, altogither flaming in loue, and frosen with feare towardes the enimie, who attended hir coming stil. Oh how fayre a courtayne is the night to suche as shame assayleth, which with hir blacke scarffe hydeth the face, that otherwise must needes be couered with bloud? Oh howe profitable it was to our louers, as well the attendaunt as attended, who at this gracious encounter, transported with extreme contentment, ranne togither to embrace eche other ardently and amiably, holding long their lippes, licked mouth to mouth, like Pigeons, whiche byll to beake bemone their loue, so as they coulde not speake but by sighes, their hearts panting in their breastes for ioye. Then the Lady of the Castell made signe to coole the courage of this braine Brabbler, who was disposed to speake somewhat to liberally, when both before hir face, and behinde hir backe, he sayd: Madame, I beseeche you let me passe this way, for I must needes wrecke mine anger by some meanes. Then proceeding (as occasion serued) he gaue ouer the quarrell in the playne fielde: whiche the gentle Damoysell perceyuing, seeing the night nowe readie to geue place vnto the breache of daye, fearing to be discouered or taken with the manner, as Venus was by the Sunne , enuious of the good happe of his brother Mars , sayd vnto Floradine : My deare friende, if I haue so muche forgotten my duetie, as to geue you part of that which parteyneth but onely vnto one, you ought wel to consider what power your loue hath had ouer me, wherof I will neuer repent me, if performing your inuiolable promise, you preserue preciously the honour wherof you onely possesse the spoyle. And therefore (my friend) thinke that from hencefoorth mine honour is so ioyned to yours, as the one can not suffer without the other. So after many trifling speeches, Floradine drewe a ring from his finger, wherein was a burning heart crowned with Iuy, and for the deuise was, The memory of my weale : the whiche he gaue to his Mistresse: Who in exchaunge gaue him a Iewel, wherein was grauen in a Margeret (for so was the name of the gentlewoman) the Image of Cupido , holding a heart and a ring pearced thorowe with an arrowe, and within it was written, Rather dye . Then after a leysurable kisse, he tooke his leaue of hir, and went out at a little wicket into a narrowe by lane, where fro thenceforth euer after the (yeeld you) was giuen him. And you shal vnderstande he neuer fayled nor needed any officer to make him appeare at euery time of appointment beeing guided in ye darke with the torch of loue. This pleasure increasing dayly,  & being so happly practised without any witnesse, but Radegond the chambermaide,  & his lackey Peter , was broken of (as nothing can always endure) by comaundement giuen to Floradine , to repaire to Xantes to see his father, who vnderstanding certen follies wer comitted by ye scholers, which according to their riotous custome bled to play the pageauntes of their Nation) feared least his sonne was in the matche. But the good olde man knew not that he played his part in another place all alone, for hinderaunce wherof he hasted too slowly. These discontentiue letters were by the louer communicated vnto his Mistresse, whom he comforted and perswaded with a short returne, leauing with hir in the meane season his hart in gage, and in recommending it vnto hir custodie, he prayed hir to vse it wel. So with great sorrow by a sterued kisse they tooke their adewe, which for teares they could not deliuer the one to the other. Then the next day in the morning, our louer departed from Poytiers , with the marchants which went vnto the royall faire of Niort , and in fewe dayes he arriued at Xaintes : where he was receyued of his olde Father, and of all his friendes, with feasting conuenient for one very long looked for. Nowe let vs leaue our Floridine , at Xantes , and returne to Paris , to see our Claribel : who beeing admitted to the aduocates barre, before he could gaine by the office, found wayes sufficient in small time to spende the money whiche he broughte in hys purse, as he that passed his youth in all pleasauntnesse. Wherby feeling him selfe very lighte, determined to take his iourney towards Poyters , where beeing arriued: he tooke not his yong wife so vnprouided, but that she had good prouision of embracings,  & wanton toyes, to feast him at his welcome home, so as one would haue thought their meetings a seconde mariage: But alas, this iolitie lasted not long. O faire Dames that fight vnder the ensigne of loue, and receyue his pay, I summon you to this schole, for he is happie and wise, who learneth by an other mans losse: Alas, it is a daungerous thing to speake, because a little worde kindleth great anger, but it is muche more hurtfull to write: for a worde spoken may be amended, beeing disguised, mistaken, or flatly denied, but writing remayneth alwayes, and serueth for an vnreprocheable witnesse, and at last for a iuste Iudge. Ah poore Gentlewoman, if thou hadst bene wel aduised, thou hadst not giuen nourishment to thy sorowfull mischeefes, in preseruing for the loue of thy Floridine , the letters which the Priest brought thee, seruing to as great effect, as to couer an egge in thy bosome, which wil disclose a mortall Aspe that shall yeelde thee a piteous recompence for thy simple affection. Alas, as we see one hearbe to comfort the liuer and kil the stomacke; so these letters which haue so greatly profited the louer, brought great and harmefull anger to the husbande, so farre foorth as this paper blotted with so pernicious ynke, argued the spotted chastitie of his Margarite. Alas, when our mishappe aresteth vs, it blindeth our eyes that we should not see it, and byndeth our handes, that we should not remedie it, yea it makes vs ministers of our owne hurtes, to execute the rigour of it. Ah how cleare an example haue we of this poore Dame, in whose absence Claribel , searching, ransacking, and ryfling hir closet, coffers, and bores, found the thing he sought not, videlicet , the letters by the which Floradine practised the loue of his wife, the letters which wer the original of the totall mischeefe, the which he read from poynt to poynt, euen to the ende, not without often alteration of complexion: for he felt his minde so strongly assayled with anguishe, that his flaming eyes, his pale face and earthly lips, gaue certain testimonie of his iust impaciece: like vnto the rage of the miserable passenger, who with his vncircumspect foote, treadeth vpon a snake sleeping in the grasse, the which rearing his head, maketh his oppressor halte with his enuenomed byting. And well serued this vnfortunate husbande his former time spent in Italy: for he had so well learned there to dissemble, as his wife knewe nothing of the matter, in beholding his countenaunce, vntill she had lost his sight and company for a full doe. And you must imagine (gracious company) that after he had long bethought him what vengeaunce he shoulde take of his disloyall wyfe, and finding none sufficient to his cruell desire (for it was a perillous thing to kill hir, not hauing proofe to conuicte hir: and to turne hir awaye with shame, coulde be but a slaunder vnto him, and that the vengeaunce woulde light on him selfe, (beeing incapable of mariage so long as she lyued) he determined at laste to take all his plate and Iewelles belonging to his wyfe, and to borowe of euery man as closely as he coulde, both vppon obligation and morgage of all and euery his landes and houses, as muche as he coulde get: So as hauing gathered together a masse of money, he made semblaunt to ryde vnto a farme of his, and vnder this colour mounted on horsebacke with his seruaunt (whom he called Hylairet ) persuaded in his mynde, that sith his wife had taken hir pleasure, he woulde play his parte as his turne came about, and would be reuenged by some meanes. Now after the Gentelwoman had bin longer time than she looked for without anye newes of hir husbande, and beeing ready to sende to see if some faire countrey Lasse retayned him not, she opened by fortune (to finde some token) the boxe wherein she kept all hyr Iewelles, in place whereof she found nothing but the Letter of Floradine , and an other paper, which she durst not open, quiuering with the suspition of the trueth: yet seeing worse could not happen, after she had well debated the matter, she opened the letter and read. When I feele in my desolate soule the cruell bytings of the torments which haue bin occasioned by your lewde gouernment (disloyall Margarite ) I knowe not if I ought to complaine of my selfe, who was so foolish as to despise my naturall fraunchise, and leane vnto the malicious libertie of women, wherein the example of so many (which haue bin found nought) ought to haue made me wise: or of my misfortune, whiche placed me so peeuishly, as thinking to finde the rest of this mortall life in mariage, I am thrust into the gulfe of miseries. And that, because loue which ought to be equally deuided betweene vs two, remaineth wholly in me, your hart neuer consenting to be partaker thereof (a periured creature) as you haue well shewed by the cheape sale whiche your lasciuious incontinencie hath made of a Iewell so precious, whereof hauing the moytie, I was neuerthelesse contented to leaue the whole in your custodie. And for recompence of the greate loue whiche I haue borne you, you haue rewarded me with eternall infamie, and made me partaker of the cryme committed by your onely misdemeanour, whiche rendereth my lyfe miserable: but the comfort I take in so great anguishe, is, that my paynes shall be short, for I am resolued to finish them in some straunge desert, taking from you (beholde vngratefull woman, howe muche I loue thee more than my selfe) the displeasure euer to see me aliue. Sith you hate me so deadly, or to reuenge me, (beholde howe I hate thee) I will depriue you of the pleasure to viewe the desired death of him, whom vnder a fayned friendshippe, for recompence of my sacred amitie you haue so lewdly betrayed. And if the iust repentaunce of your vniust offence reuiueth in you at any time the remembraunce of me, knowe for certayne you haue for euer lost me. He, that bicause he coulde not liue happie to him selfe alone, is by the meanes of an other miserably dead. Claribel . As the Pecocke ouerladen with rayne, drowpeth heade to the earth, euen so this desolate Gentlewoman, (after she had bathed hir tender brest with teares, leaning hir head in hir lap, drowned in weeping and sighes, wrong hir armes, and rent hir yealowe heare, so as shee seemed to haue no recourse but vnto vgly dispayre, nowe accusing hir folly, then hir mishappe, but chiefly the keye of hir boxe, whiche had so lewdly betrayed hir Mistresse. But sithe the oyle of Tyme is a soueraigne salue for euery sore, Tyme muste needes doe more in this myserable woman than Uertue. Therefore let vs leaue hir there for a tyme to tyre vpon payne, in recompence of hir passed pleasure, and retourne to oure Traueller. Who as the hurte man feeleth more greefe when hys wounde is searched, than when he is fyrst wounded: euen so renewing the memory of his receuied displeasure, he felt his torment increase in such sorte, as in despighte he woulde willingly haue hanged him selfe, but that he bethought him (I know not howe) that his bagge was full, and that it shoulde be great folly for hym to enriche some wretche, who would but mocke him: whereby he tooke newe comforte, and from thenceforth determined to solicite hys cares with delightfulnesse (in some pleasaunte place) so long as his money lasted, and altogither to shunne the company of women as muche as he might, esteeming that Nature after she had giuen to euery creature his contrary, and subiected al things vnto man, could not giue any other contrarie vnto him than the woman, whose malice is sworne enimie to mans reason, wherein the same Nature hath bene more stepmother vnto men, than vnto beastes: For (sayde he) beasts knowe their contraries, and flye them, but man is naturally inclined to searche and loue his enimie: the woman who for that she was created of a Ribbe (which is a harde and toughe bone) is so fierce, harde, and cruell, as hir heart can not be mollified by any benefite. Thus despiting womankind, our Claribel rode the space of three dayes iourneys, and one euening he was so benighted, as he was enforced to lodge in a village neere vnto Xantes , out of the high wayes, where there was neuer an Inne to lodge in: but seeing the night constrayned him to stay there, he prayed a husbandman to receiue him into hys house vntill the next morning. Nowe he had no sooner set foote on the ground, but he behelde an olde Gentleman leading an olde Gentlewoman, hauing a young Damoysel attending vpon hir, which came on walking after supper. And beeing aduertised that it was the Lady of that village, he went to salute them, forcing an alteration of his newe nature and resolution to become a mortall enimie to women. Unto hir he discoursed his vnexpected arriuall in that place, so farre out of al common passage, in suche good order, as the Dame not only sayd vnto him, that he was welcome, but seeing him so euyll bested, woulde needes haue him take a bed in hir Castell: wherefore vanquished by hir gracious importunitie, in fine hee consented, and taking the young Damoysell (who walked alone) by the arme, conducted them vnto the place where the collation was prepared for the walkers, and supper for the traueler was sodaynely made ready. Now the noueltie of the place,  & the entertainment which our Pilgrim receiued by this faire company, knewe so finely to steale away the remembraunce of his familiar enuy, as he tooke no care but for him selfe, and during, & after supper to discouer and deuise a thousande preatie tales and iestes, so pleasante and fit for the purpose, as they were sufficient sauce to sauoure the basest fare in the world, leauing the assistauntes in meruaile of his perfections, vnto whome it seemed they hadde neuer seene a man better learned, who behaued hymselfe more Gentleman like, or had a better grace to commende hys vsage secreately vnto the heartes of euerye one (as indeede they which knew hym) confesse, that his gentle spirite can very well declare by practise, that he hath seene muche. Thus deuising, they passed the euening vntill it was bedtime, which caused the Gentlewoman, hauyng broughte hir newe gueste into hir chamber, to wishe him good reste, and bidding him good night, departed. Then calling to hir a lackey (whom she knew trustie and quicke witted) she charged him to fynd some deuise, that one of the Gentlemans horses who came that euening, might be so lame, as hee woulde do no seruice the nexte morning (notwithstanding without spoyling or hurting the beaste) for shee was willing to haue hym staye longer, knowing he hadde no haste in his waye, bycause the Pilgrime had informed hir, he trauailed but to Burdeaux to see an vncle he hadde dwelling there, (vnto whome hee was inheritour) and whome he mente to perswade to discharge hys handes of the presidentes estate, leaste that hee shoulde lose by his death, which now could not long linger. The boy to put his charge in execution, bethoughte hym of a knauerye fitte for a wagstring, the righte birde of Jone Baily : for hauing drawne two heares from the horse taile, he twisted them, and bounde them about the foote of the beaste iuste vnderneath the footlocke, and fastened it feately vnder the heare, as no man coulde discerne the binder: then he putte a serpentes tongue vnder hys eare, to the ende the horse by his continuall trembling, mighte seeme to haue the Yues: so that in the morning, the poore beaste thus dressed, durste not straine vppon his bounde foote, wherby it happened that Claribel supposing it hadde bin some wrench, commaunded his man to bathe the horse leg, and in the meane time was constrained to tarry, wherof he excused himselfe towardes his hostesses, which coulde not refraine to vtter vnto him, how well they were pleased therewith. And seeing hym staied, they endeuored with al carefulnesse to make him passe the time pleasantlye. The whiche he could not handle so cunningly, but somtime at a suddaine the memorie of his mischiefe made hym sigh by the liuely attaintes thereof, whyche caused the young Damoysell, who the more she marked him, the more she perceyued euery houre to spring in hym, I knowe not what came of good liking by a secreate priuity, wherevnto she gaue hirselfe accesse to demaunde what it was, that so euill entreated hym, as hys sighes witnessed and declared, saying, that hys griefe muste needes delyuer hym mortall warre in secreate, sith it feared not to assaile him in companie. Nowe the good gentleman was not so abashed (although he blushed as a mayden seeing hir betrothed goodman) but that he founde a finer excuse for hys aunswere: saying that he had loued a dame, who (after she had holden his nose to the grindestone three yeares, suckeling him wyth deade hope wythout euer being offended by him in any pointe,) againste the secreate faith giuen and receiued betweene them two, had married an olde dotarde, who coulde no waye content hir but with iewells and braue apparell. Wherevppon said he (sighing and disguised before the Gentlewoman, that whiche he coulde not disguise vnto his hearte) remembring my selfe, I dye walking: Wherevnto the young Damoysell aunswered: Alas sir, howe contrarye is youre griefe vnto mine, whych causeth mee to bee apparelled as you see? For in good faith, she caried sorowe, bothe in garment and countenaunce. Ah you complaine that you haue not beene loued, and I lament that I haue beene loued too muche by two Gentlemen, whyche being frantike wyth extreame iealousie, and by fortune encountring hereby, (as the one departed hence, and the other was repayring hither) they drewe theyr swordes, and dealte so daungerouslye, as the one liued not halfe a quarter of an houre after the other: wherefore I haue sustained suche sorrowe, as I am become enimy to all consolation. Ha maistresse aunswered Claribel , it is not happened of late dayes, that beautie is more hurtefull than anye weapon, as witnesseth Hippolamia, Dianyna, Athlanta , and dyuers other noble dames, whose nuptialls haue bene honoured with the bloude of moste valiant and couragious youthes, yea and not content with the losse of particular persons, haue burned greate Cities, as Helene and others. And the greateste mischiefe is, that thys beautie in steede to destroye hir enimies, neuer murthereth anye but hir friendes, whereof we viewe cruell tokes which way soeuer we turne our eies. Wherfore I meruaile not at all (Maistresse) if youre perfections haue coste the liues of the desirous Louers, for the whiche I know no gentle harte that woulde not desire to dye so manye tymes, as in dying the deathe might be agreeable vnto you. Then mildly vnlosing hys tongue, tempered in moste sauoursome hony, he beganne to comforte the Gentlewomans distresse, who taking his talke to hir aduauntage, felte by little and little the same fyre reuiue in hir tender hearte, whyche beforetyme hadde kindeled it. And thenceforth shee beganne to hope to recouer in thys Gentleman, that whyche shee hadde loste in hir other two seruauntes, whereof oure Pilgrime (who was not new in thys facultie, and hadde hys eye quicke inoughe to discerne a Flye in the ayre) perceyued hir sodainelye: wherefore after hee hadde debated the matter in his minde, in fine gaue gained occasion vnto Loue, and determined not to shewe hymselfe a cowarde, hoping that the new woulde chace away the old euil, as one naile driueth out an other. The which he handled so happily and hastily, that from lookes the firste messengers of Loue, they proceeded to requests,  & from words vnto effectuall actes: In so muche, as in shorte time the branches & buds were onely witnesses of their amorous embracings, whiche they continued a certaine season, vntill yt Claribel (who was not a sleepe with the songs of this sweete Sirene ) for so was ye damoisells name) thoughte in shorte time he might be discouered, and being knowen, not only approued a lyar, but a deceiuer and abuser of maydens. And also mighte be in daunger to carry two rockestaues and one spindle, an ordinary punishement for suche as haue twoo wiues at one tyme. For the preuentyng whereof, foreseeing well, that his hostesses,  & principally the yonger, woulde neuer graunte him leaue, he determined with himselfe to take licence to departe: Whervpon he called his man Hillairet one day, and sayde vnto hym: thou muste thys night fynde the meanes to steale awaye my clokebag, and wyth all speede get thee towarde Burdeaux , and tarry for me at Burghe , where I wil meete thee. And to the ende to couloure oure departure, thou muste robbe me, thereby to giue me occasion to pursue thee. And to take occasion to robbe mee, thou muste suffer to be beaten for quarrelling with some of the seruauntes of the house. The whiche the strippeling, who was well reclaimed to the lure, and as menne saye, Like maister, Like man , conueied his knauerie so cunninglye, as the nexte euening his maister founde hym roundely at buffettes wyth the Cooke. Then Claribel wythout anye wordes parted the bicker wyth a cudgell, and beganne to dubbe hys doughty gallant thriftilye therwyth, who made no resistaunce, but fledde as faste as he coulde towardes the stable; where his mayster grinding hys teeeh, threatning to be maruellouslye enraged folowed hym, and althoughe he touched him not, he cried as he had bene slaine. And to make semblante that hys maister had trodden him vnder his feete, the companion wallowed in the horse litter, and begrimed his face in suche sorte, as the dame of the Castle seeing him in this piteous estate, accused greatelye his maisters choller, wishing he had rewarded the Cooke with the ouerplus of blowes which he bestowed vppon hys manne: Who making a noise all the night, played his parte so well, that the fyrste good morrowe his maister hadde, was, that his seruante Hillairet was runne awaye. If Claribel counterfaited abashement and astonishement, it is not to be doubted, principallye missing his cloakebag. Neuerthelesse comming somewhat to his senses, very well (sayde hee) it is not the fyrste tyme he hath played me this pranke: but he was euill aduised to leaue mee a horse to poste after him. And by Christ, it is not yet so long since he wente, but I will apprehende hym before I sleepe: and you will wonder (saide he) to his hostesses, if I shoulde bring hym hither vnto you before bed time, what greate iourney soeuer hee thinke to make. Ah ha, I will teache hym to know the hound is not escaped, that draweth his home after hym. Then tourning him aboute, he saide vnto the horsekeeper, I praye thee bridle my horse, for the longer I linger, the worse. The whiche being speedily dispatched, sodainely he mounted thereon, saying he woulde neither eate nor drinke, but with the Gentleman his man, who scarcely had caried his horse so far as to the watering. Wherfore saying adue, without farewell vnto his kind hostesse, he gallopped so faste (as his horse, whiche was nowe no more lame but freshe and lustye with long reste) in shorte space carried him to Bourg . where he founde his man. And there they furnished them with necessaryes, and determined to coast the coutrey, beginning their vncertaine voyage throughe Gascoigne . In the meane time our Xantoinois gentlewomen, after they had long attended their gueste in vaine, they accompted him clearely loste. And bicause that whatsoeuer diligent enquirie was made, they could heare no newes of hym at Burdeaux , where hys vncle disauowed him, feare, which is the companion of Loue, caused the young louer to suspecte howe the game fadged, who began to enter into newe lamentations. But we wil leaue hir a while to disgeste hir griefes amid the woods, where she had receiued so greate pleasure, and also cease oure voiage to retourne vnto Floradine , who attendeth vs at Xaintes in his fathers house, where we lefte him among his friendes. The whiche (as it is a custome, when men see a yong man ready to run a rouing) to prouide hym a matche (whyche menne call, to talke of hys aduauncement) they sollicited the good olde manne hys father to thinke therevppon: who lente hys eare willinglye therevnto, desiryng to see hys sonne prouided before his death, consideryng hee was nowe threatened wyth a Reume, whiche gaue hym personall summonance of shorte dayes. Neuerthelesse, hys wyll was, that hys sonne shoulde choose in suche cases, and shoulde truste vnto none but to hymselfe: For so muche as syth wee marry to please oure fantasies, and not oure neighboures, it is greate follye to take a woman of an other mans lyking, the deceyte whereof shoulde bee more waightye than happened by hys proper defaulte. According to thys councell, the yong man, (as men say) put the nosegaye in his eare, but he hunted not long vpon thys amorous traile, before he rowsed a Country damoysell (whom he at vnwares espied tripping towards hir Laier) whose gallant glee so gladded his fantasie, as she gained the maisterie of hys heart. The which comming to his fathers knowlege, who esteemed not his son fickle headed or vnaduised, in lodging his affections within so happy a harbor, willingly conseted therevnto, & caused the parentes of the maiden to be moued in the matter: who conceyuing great towardenesse in the yong man (for you shal note, he would not giue his heade for ye washing) and that his possessions wer able to couteruaile ye maides possibility, they founde the matche very meete, considering hir youthfull floure beganne nowe to fade: and (as good companions saye) as daintye things are desired, and commmon things little regarded, so yong maidens are worthy to be required, but the aged are euer dispised. Thus, by common consent, the wedding ensued wyth great magnificence, where all the Gentlemen there-abouts in fauour of the yong gentlewoman, and al the youth of Xaintes , for the honour of Floradin were present singing this Epithalame ensuing. And round about the rolling globe, his glaring beames doth beare, Surrenders vp his roomth, and dothe resigne the skie, To thousande thousandes fierie lights, that dimmes eche drowsie eie, And irkesome ougly night, doth spreade his darkesome wings, And of Argentine Luna she, the haruest horses brings, I see the scorching sunne in Seas to plunge from farre, And after him pursueth neare, the blasing sheppardes starre: Proceede then lustie youthes, let ioy beare all the swaye, And honoure Hymen at this feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. O famous splendant starre by Cupid stayde aboue, The pressed slaue at all assayes, and messenger of Loue, Haste, haste thy wonted pace, and poure downe pleasaunte sleepe, To quech the furious frying flames, that makes our bridegrom wepe. Thou glorious starre, of whome dame Venus made hir choice, For witnesse of hir plesaunte sports wherin hir thralles reioyce: Make haste with penned course, I praye thee do not staye, But honoure Hymen at thys feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. O starre more fierce than Mars , more cruell and vnkinde, VVhy stealest thou thys ioyfull daye for Virgins aide assignde? And ravste our sister deare, who once among vs dwelt, To yeelde hir thrall to husbandes lawes whereof she neuer felt? And cause this tender Impe forget hir louing Dame, And graunte to beare the seruile yoke which strangely will hir tame, VVhose flower nowe consentes, to wither and decaye, VVhy shoulde we honoure Hymen then, and blesse this wedding day? Euen as wee see the Vine that springeth vp on hye, VVithout a prop to staye his twigs, doth wither waste and dye, And then his barraine boughes, whereon no fruite doth growe, Deserues not of the husbandman the pruning knife to knowe. But if the stubborne Elmes, supporte his tender taunts, Soone shewes his purple in his greene whereof the Tilman vaunts. So she that dothe consume hir age in Virgins life, Hir freshe will fade, but if she yeelde to be a wedded wife, And choose a louing feere, with fruite she shall encrease, VVhich will hir auntient parentes glad, with ioyes that shal not cease, To daunce the preatie babes in satten mantels gaye, Oh honoure Himen at thys feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. Euen as the fragrante rose, the hostesse of the Flye, Yong maydes delight, and yong mens ioye the pleasure of the eie, So long as it adornes the bushe whereon it blomes, It doth receiue the deawe of Heauen, and fresher still becomes: But being plucked downe, the hewe doth fade anone, And nought remaineth but the stalke, from whence the rose is gone: So she, that homage dothe vnto the lawes of Loue, Liues vnder yoke of toyle and care, as keeping house dothe proue. Farewell then daintie cheare, all pleasaunte sports adew, Then flee from youthfull company, for feare of priuie viewe, In chimney corner close, she bideth at the baye, VVhy shoulde we honoure Hymen then, or blesse this wedding daye? Proceede oh parched spouse in flames of beauties beames, Reuenge thee nowe of cruell Loue, and of his sterne extreames: Triumphe oh happy man, and nowe possesse thy ioy At ease, and quench the coale wherewith Loue did thy hearte annoy: I viewe in open campe, a thousande Cupids flye, In signe of conqueste yeelding bowe, and brondes to scale the skie. All torments hides their heade, that plagde thy pining harte, Contented minde with might, doth make all grisly griefes departe: And where in ielous doubtes a thousande pangs did growe, Possession may be pleaded nowe, the same to ouerthrowe. Sith then the fielde is wonne, and thou at quiet reste, Away with armoure, speare, and shielde, reioyce among the beste, For victories behoofe, our banners we display, And honoure Hymen at this feaste, and blesse this wedding daye. O Hymen , happy childe of nature, moulde of all, Hymen the brother vnto Loue, to whome all Louers call For comforte in distresse, that by thy puissaunte might They maye enioy their wished will, and haue their hartes delight, Sith that thy pleasure is to trace out of our traine Our sister, and in husbandes armes, so sweetely to retaine, And of hir Virgins state, sith he muste cracke the bande, In recompence of this hir losse, let this hir guerdon stande, Exile from them contempt, and iealousie of brayne, Let sacred loue chaine fast their hearts, and in their minds remayne. And make hir of a mayde, a wife and mother glad, To gouerne well hir familie in wisedomes holy trade: And that eche one of vs in order as they goe, By guage thereof, the surest meane to loue and liue may know, And knowing pleasure is the ende of payne alway, VVe honour Himen at this feast, and blesse this wedding day. Shortly after this fortunate mariage, the good olde man seeing an ende of that whiche he had desired, gaue his blessing vnto Floradine , and in his last sleepe departed to rest with his fathers, leauing vnto his sonne wonderfull wealth. But according to the curse which Epicteta gaue vnto richesse, he spet them pleasauntly ynough, making great cheare vnto euery man. Oh if this delicate season had not bin so short: but what? it was longer than it ought to haue continued, if euery mans nose had bin long ynough. For you shall vnderstande (gracious company) that the wife of Floradine was brought to bedde within sixe monethes after he was maried, who (to the ende you may knowe hir) was the very same Serenna , of whom I made report vnto you, who feeling at hir girdell I knowe not what, which would appeare agaynst hir will, made no refusall of the mariage, to the ende it might couer hir folly. But the childe which coulde not attende the seuenth moneth, disclosed the whole matter, confessing he was framed without doubt, by the faire workmanship of Claribel , left for payment to his hostesse. Nowe I leaue you to thinke what pleasure it was to the newe married man, to see him selfe so soone a father, and without his trauayle to haue gotten this fayre gifte. Well, I can assure you that his companions ceased from thencefoorth to visite him, for feare to haue their part of the shame: which was ye cause that (as sorow hath more puissaunce vpon a solitarie person, than vpon him that is frequented with copany) the miserable Floradin thought to dye with despight, esteeming that all men spake their fantasies of him, sith no person came to visite him: And further, he was brought into suche extremitie, as he durst not goe to see any man, hauing so great shame of this dishonour, as he thought he sawe continually children about him, poynting at him with their finger, and lelling out their toungs. So as he made full account to bydde all companie adewe, vnlesse he woulde haue euery man to take him by the hornes. Beeing thus scorned with this shamefull reproche, and (for that he durst not go to any place where he was knowen, to qualifie his cares) seeing hir in our Ladyes bands, who in hir neast brooded the egge of an other, (of whom he would neuer make enquirie, fearing it was some scoffing losell, which greeued him most of all) determined to trauayle farre ynough into some quarter where no man knewe him, vntyll that tyme had learned him to tollerate his dure and waightie troubles with perfecte patience. Wherefore carying with him all the money he could gather togither, he tooke horse, commaunding his man Peter to followe him with an other: and without speaking of any worde (for if he had thought his shirt had knowen his meaning, he had burnt it) he betooke him to his aduenture. But what suttletie soeuer he vsed, his griping greefes left him not, although he fledde himselfe to flye it, neither could he so dissemble his behauiour, but his mournefull face and sorowfull countenaunce betrayed to all men the dolour of his heart. The whiche his Hoste perceyuing, iudging the payne proceeded of loue, beganne to reason with him in most pleasaunt maner, discoursing vpon the nature of women, and paynting them out in their colours. Whereby he concluded after a long narration of their ordinarie illusions, that the moste expedient meanes, aswell for Louers as for deceyued husbands, was, to thinke that all women were women, and wer not different but in face, and in some suttleties, which are more or lesse familiar to some than to others, the better to pinche and without laughing: So as to doo wel, men must giue them their will, and for their owne parts doo the best they may, for profite and prouision of well ordering their families: and that suche as haue the brydle so loose, neuer runne so faste as the others, who are restrayned of their course. To these mischeefes, perceyuing vnder a counterfaite personage his tale was tolde, he beganne to giue eare, and resolued him selfe to follow this good counsayle, the which from the next daye in the morning he practised expertly: for seeing his Hoste was gone (according to his custome) very earely vnto the towne to make his prouision, he entered the listes with his Hostesse, and with the disaduauntage of the combate departed well pleased, but better eased: and mounting on Horsebacke, followed as well his good beginning, as his voyage. Nowe if Floradine left great proofes of his prowesse whersoeuer he became, Claribel shewed him selfe no lesse valiaunt: for hauing begunne sooner, and continued longer, this custome had altered his nature anewe: so as already he had approued his person in many perillous enterprises, bycause he had trauelled many Nations, as the Countreys of Gascoyne, Languedoc, Prouince, Daulphine, Burgoigne, Champaigne , and the Realme of Fraunce , from whence he departed into Beauce , where he purposed to remayne a whyle. Notwithstanding, thinke not that he liued idelly, for he consumed his time in courting ye acquointance of a Millers wife, whose good man kept a wind mil neare vnto Bourg , where he was lodged: with whom he was quickly agreed, and this condition of meting concluded betweene them, that when hir husbande was from home, she shoulde hang out a white Kercheffe at the loouer of the Myll, for an amorous ensigne. Nowe it chaunced one euening, when the Miller was gone a fishing to the next poole, a Gentleman and his man beeing benighted, and hauing lost their way, arriued at this Mill (whiche appeared far off) and demauded if he might not for loue or money that night haue houserome for him  & his horses. Herevnto the courteous Millers wife gaue hir consent, bicause she saw he was young & faire, & therfore vnworthy to lye a bleching. This guest beeing entred, & hauing fed vpon such fare as his Hostesse had to cheare him, after thankes rendered for hir courtesie, by little and little he vsed his approches in suche wise, as he entred into request of Loue, in so good manner, as after a fewe feeble contradictions they lay together. But by misfortune Claribel (who was not slouthfull) beeing gone to reuiue olde reuels, discouered the flagge of defiaunce, which his minion had displayde at hir husbands departure, forgetting to pull in hir banner at the arriuall of hir gallant guest. Whereby (pricked with prouender) he knocked rashly at the Myll doore, whiche greatly amased the Millers wife, supposing it had bin hir husband. Wherefore sodaynly she conuayed hir newe friende into a little corner behinde the sackes, and went to open the doore vnto hir pricke of prouision: with whom after accustomed cullings, she entred commons. But Ball was scarce vnbrideled, whe as the Miller bounsed at the doore, beeing timely returned, by reaso the wether was vnfit for fishing, which caused the good wife to hasten to the doore, who willed Claribel to hide him selfe where he could. Then hauing closely raked vp the coles, she let in hir grimme good man, who was sore offended with the sluggishe sleepinesse of his wife. But his choler was quickly conuerted into bashment and feare, when assoone as he came into his chamber, he heard a couple, crying, cuffing, and scratching togither. For you shall note, that Claribel searching a corner to couer him, crept behinde the sackes, where the wife had placed hir other louer, who was in a pecke of troubles, fearing lest it had bin some Ruffian of the queanes acquayntaunce, appointed by hir to cutte his throte for his money, whiche caused the whole cauell. The poore Miller fraught with feare, made not many steps of a dosen staires, and crying theeues, he hasted towards the next village to rayse neighbours to apprehend them. But there was a let, the doore stoode in his waye, wheragaynst he flewe with suche force, as he ouerthrewe on the floore: whereby his wife present at his resurrection, perswaded him to be content, declaring vnto him that those he feared were two poore passengers, which knewe not whither to go, nor where to become, vnto whom she had giuen house rome for Gods sake, and were afrayde to heare suche hastie bounsing at the doore so late in the night, whiche caused their noyse: whereby all contentions were appeased on euery part, although the Miller was scarsly pleased with his wiues charitie, yet he seemed very well contented, and prayed his guestes to haue patience, whiche he him selfe coulde not take, but determined to be reuenged of his wife: who beeing (as he thought) in hir sounde sleepe, he arose very softly, and tooke the headstall of his Moyle that was made of corde, the which he fastened about his wiues necke. Nowe she seeming as though she had bene faste sleeping, finely conueying hir armes betweene the coller and hir throte, endured so constantly the drawing of the rope (without any noyse) making semblaunt so sore to choke, struggle, and stretche, as hir husbande thought he had strangled hir, according to his determinate intent, whiche caused him with speede to trusse vp hys packe, and mount vpon his Moyle, to flye, fearing the apprehension of the Iustice. But sodenly his minde gaue him, it was better to procure some neighbours to searche his Mill, where these companions beeing founde with his dead wife, shoulde be conuicted of the murther: Yet fearing in fine the truth woulde quayle all collusion, he thought it the surest way to flye,  & that a good offence was better worth than a wicked amendes. Thus the miserable Miller fled: but vnluckily he encountered the seruaunt of his first guest, keeping his masters horses, for whiche there was no roome in the Mill. This vnhappy wag stayed and ouerthrew the fugitiue, and seazed vpon his Moyle and packe, whereagaynst the poore man durst make no resistaunce, by reason of the hast and desire he had to saue his life: for his guiltie conscience made him suspect that nowe the Marshals prouost was at his tayle, ready to rewarde him with a horse nightcap. Nowe let vs leaue our Lackey on foote, & returne to the Mill, where the poore pete, knowing hir husbande was fledde through the opinion of hir strangling, all pensiue what shoulde become of hir, arose and with some payne lighted a lampe, and went to starte hir two guestes, tapized among the sackes of meale, as a hare in a brakebushe: They by the fauour of the light growing in knowledge together, ouercome with extreme ioy, embraced eche other so louingly, as a man would haue sayd, that the vehemencie of their auncient affection reuiued, skirmishing with abashment and meruayle of their meeting in that place, would haue bereeued their wits. For you shall vnderstand (honorable company) that this guest who had broke open Claribels countinghouse, was our gentle Floradine his great friende, who (as I haue tolde you) after he was stollen from his childe dame, hauing trauelled through the countreys of Britaine, Aniou, Main , and some partes of Normandie , was by fortune arriued in this Mill. O fortunate Mill, wherin are encountred two friends, which neuer met sith their pleasant life in Italy. Now as they renued their olde amitie, not yet fully satisfied with embracings and laughter at the feare they conceyued of them selues, their young Hostesse kneeling before them with teares, required the to haue consideration of hir calamitie, and in lieu of the pleasure she had shewed them, not to denie hir the grace and pitie which she deserued, that for their sakes was for euer a spoyled and miserable wretche. Then she shewed them the testimonie of hir husbandes, cruell attempt and purpose by the circle which the cord had printed in hir Iuorie neck, which moued them to great compassion. Wherefore lifting hir from the earth, with amorous embracings, they promised neuer to forsake hir, but in recompence of hir benefites, they would so prouide for hir, as she should be contented, if she would consent to followe them, as she might doo easily. For the performaunce whereof, they counselled hir to borrowe money among hir neighbours, vpon the morgage of hir Mill, fayning that hir husband was gone to a fayre to buy cattell, and wanting money, willed hir so to doo. Which deuice beeing exactly finished by the woman, they disguised hir like a page, and horsing hir vpon the Moyle, which Peter the seruant of Floradine had taken from the Miller, they began their iourney togither, with this new prouision of loue, which they frequented with their chamber page, whom they called Miller. Thus trauayling, they enquired the one of the other how they had ledde their liues sith they departed, and entred so farre into talke, as they forgotte not to vtter the causes of their enterprised voyage, in such sorte as reporting the discourse of their loues, without any abridgement of the truth (for their priuitie would not permit the) they perceiued in fine, the one of them was the occasion of the others meeting, and how by a crosse blow they grew acquainted with the Cuckow, the one in the wood, the other in the fielde. Which was a newe confederation and establishment of their amitie, without any malice or yl wil: and from that time forward they concluded a perpetuall brotherhood. Then seeing they had sufficiently cried quittaunce on both sides, they began to disclose betweene them the principall experiments of their art,  & with such dexteritie proued who had best profited in ye schole of loue, as it was very likely they vsed certaine charms, which were of force to constraine all resistaunce to yeelde, & had power at midnight to make doores flye open, were they neuer so strongly locked or barred. So as there was none so sauage (whom men call chast) but they coulde tame, and nothing escaped the nettes of these good hunters. For according as occasion serued, now they made request, and then they were intreated: nowe they bestowed gifts, and then they receyued rewardes: sometime they searched, and sometime they were sought: so as eyther by presents, by promises, by pleasantnesse, by faire speech, or by amorous seruices, they forced so rebellious willes, as there was no virgin, wife, widdowe, Nunne, poore, riche, young, olde, faire, foule, great, little, hye, lowe, wise, foolishe, fatte, or leane, but downe they went they knewe not howe. And they made their traffique sometime to a single profite, and sometime to halues: but when they founde nothing worthy to be beloued, they had recourse vnto their daily Miller, who for this reason they spared as muche as they might, and sent their men to seeke their meate abrode. In this estate they ordered their iourney many miles in diuers places, bearing the countenance of Commissaries appoynted for to reforme the wicked customes of women. But their pretences were interrupted by ye rumour of the third ciuill wars: for all the passages beeing barred, they were enforced to stay. Notwithstanding they found pasport, for they went to buy armour at Towres , and made them faire coates of two fashions, whereof the one had many crosses, and the other none, but was all white, bearing in one pocket our Ladies mattins, and in the other the Geneua Psalmes, to the ende they might accorde with all companies, and euery religion. In this order they entred among the Ensignes that marched towards Poytou , obseruing this maxime in their mindes, to be alwayes farthest from the fight, busiest in the bootie, and first in the flight: and especially to cary their curates of proofe behinde them: And if any charge were to be giuen vpo the enimie, they had euer some lette, eyther the restinesse of their horses, or their seruauntes were not at hande with their gauntlets, and a thousande other common places of sutteltie, which they knewe by roate, exercising the arte of warre in corners by couples, whiche they practized dayly, vntill the iourney of Lusson , where the olde bandes were slayne by the Rochellers . There Floradine fledde valiauntly, casting his armour to the earth, as he that hoped onely in God and his spurres. But the miserable Claribel , bicause he fledde not faste inough, yet not for lacke of good will, was caught, and ledd to Morance , with many others, who were much amazed to see him taken, but he resolued their doubtfulnesse, whe he reported the heauinesse of his armour to be the cause therof. Nowe the next day they were all released without raunsome, except our poore Claribel , who beeing founde (at vnwares) tylting in a stable with a Launcemans Tannikin (who although she vnderstoode not his language, knewe the signification of his signes) was carried to Rochell , beeing with muche adoo saued from the Mufmaffes, who would haue hewed him in peeces with their halberds. Now beeing come to Rochel , bycause al lodgings were ful by reason of the gret multitude of people which daily repaired thither, his chamber was prouided in the prison, vntill the day that his processe should be criminally tried, where he preached many learned lessons out at his grated pulpit, saying, Now he knew the Rochellers from other straungers, by certayne perfect tokens, whereof he conferred with the Gaylors wife, who once a nighte holpe him to releeue the watche, by whose secrete acquayntaunce, he crept so cunningly into hir conscience, and caste his figure so effectually, as for recompence of his paines employed in hir businesse, shee saued his life, dispatching him out of prison, and conueying hym oute of the town in this gret distresse: In such wise as the executors of Iustice (for this offece was punished with death, althogh the laws of Fraunce permitte not suche extreamitie,) entring into the Tarrassed Towre, founde not the man, but in his place many figures, carracters, and certaine crosses diuersly drawne, which made them sodainly coniecture, that thys companion hadde saued hymselfe by arte magike, or was flowne awaye, althoughe they neuer hearde tell of anye that flewe, but Jcarus and hys father: wherwith they were so afraide, as their heare stoode on ende, scuffeling who shoulde firste flee awaye, for feare the deuill woulde carry them after hym they sought. Wherevppon greate bruite was spread in all places of the towne. In the meane tyme, oure man beyng caried oute of Rochell in a dungcarte, and set in the open fielde, onely in his dublet, passing to the next baite, he called for good cheare, but whe he came to the paying of the shotte, in steede of putting his hande in hys purse, he groaped in hys codpeece (pardon mee though I speake not more properly) In this estate he came to sainct Jus , wher hee found his companion with the stuffe, which was great pleasure to both parties. Who after olde acquaintance renued, departed towardes ye Isle of Brouage , where being arriued very late, they had mean entertainment, but to amend their cheare, about midnight a false alarme was giuen, whiche troubled oure two souldiours meruellouslye, (being altogither ignorant where to become, or whether to flee for safegarde.) At laste, the most expedient meane they could deuise, was, to clime ouer walles and fences, and passe through the Gardens: from whence, after they had remayned a while hidden, and hearing the garboyle ceased, (creeping abroade as a snaile out of the shell, being almost afraid one of another) they drewe towardes the backe dore of a house whiche they founde slenderly barred, the which fleeing open with small stresse, caused them to enter in thereat, conluding (if they had met any man which shoulde demaunde whether they went) to say they had charge to search euery house, and viewe in what eadinesse euery man was (during the alarme) and also to make them hang light out at their windowes. But they were eased of that paine, for (hauing searched euerye corner) they found no creature: but in one chamber they saw two french hoodes of veluet lying vppon a table, and besides them a great greasie hatte. The turning their eies aside, they espied in a gret bed two yong women, and a great bursten bellied slaue betwen them, so soundly sleeping, as they hearde nothing of the noise. And ye may wel thinke our two companions had no great haste to awake them, for they were so surprised with abashement, as they would willingly haue bin further from thence. For you shal vnderstande, they knewe immediately, that for certaintie these women were their wiues, who by vnexpected fortune wer met togither in that place. For Margarite , Maistresse Font de Argent , and wife vnto Claribel , fleeing from the siege of Poictiers , was come to Xaintes , towardes hir aunt (whome I recommended before vnto youre memorie,) wher esteeming hir person in small safety, she was remoued into the Ilandes. There by fortune shee found Syrena the wife of Floradin retired thither for hir better assuraunce: who being of a strange countrey (as she was hirselfe) seemed a very fit companion to comforte hir in these common calamities. Whereby they grewe in suche league of familiaritie, as all ioye or sorrowe was equall betweene them: as their husbands perceiued very wel, who scratching where it ytched not, returned with a Fly in their eare. But being without the dores they began to breake into laughter, saying the one to the other, See what paines thy wife taketh: haste thou not feare hir heart will fainte? And concluded to learne what the worshipfull gentleman that might be, who for feare of the snik vp, lay so louinglye beetweene twoo women, wyth suche assuraunce of hys sufficiencie. But Miller, theyr chamber page (who was neuer oute of theyr sighte) and good cause why, soone resolued thys their doubte, assuryng them vndoubtedlye it was the Miller hir husbande, whereof they were yet more abashed, for thys encounter seemed a matter wroughte by enchauntement. By the faythe of a Souldioure (sayde Claribel ) he hath reason, and I like well his dealing. Alas wherfore should he not lye betweene our two wiues seeing his wife lyeth euer betwene vs two? It is true (saide Floradin ) but I remember yet how wickedlye hee woulde haue vsed hys wife for oure sakes, and I dare saye hee beleeueth, and will sweare by the faithe of a Myller, that hee hathe murthered hir. Nowe after manye mery motions verye medicinable for their comforte, they resolued to goe giue theyr wiues good morrowe, to redintegrate and newlye confyrme the amities of wedlocke, and reenter into theyr auncient house keeping, whyche nowe woulde seeme straunge vnto them, and to esteeme theyr wiues neuer the worse, nor impeach them of any passed crime: consideryng all accomptes reckened, and euerye ouerplus abated, the remainder of debte was small on either parte: but if they durste haue saide so, they had muche commended theyr owne dooings, in imitating the opinion of men, who affirme, that a house is of muche more value being inhabited, than remayning desert and abandoned to vermine and spiders, and that it is much better to sayle in the ship wel experimented in the sure transporte of diuers passengers, than in the vessell that neuer carried anye person, as also for that they had good cause to be contented wyth theyr wiues, & to praise exceedingly their chastitie and notable continencie, that could so satisfie their turnes with one man betweene them both, sith it was the least which coulde be required in a matter so necessary. Thus perseuering in thys good aduice, as soone as it was day (for the which they longed greately) they receiued their wiues louingly, by whom they wer so ioyfully accepted, as if it had bin the day of their mariage. But before they had recouered the, secretly reciting the crafty conueiances whiche their wiues had vsed towards the by turne, determined sith proofe made the priuie of their behauior, to alter their coditions, so soone as they were possessed of them. But the consideration of the peoples mutinie and the renuing of loue, hindered their pretence. By their example the Miller receiued his wife, wyth no lesse meruaile, than if he hadde seene hir risen from deathe, and besought hir to pardon hys follye. So likewise the Maisters in solemnization of thys fortunate daye matched their men in marriage with their wiues Chaumbermaides, whome they had knowen long time, that is to wit, Peter with Radegonde ,  & Hillairet with Syrenas seruaunte, whiche was so roughly executed, as the poore mice coulde take no reste in the bedstrawe. Then oure amorous souldiors, vnderstanding the force of Rochel approched to besiege the Ilandes bothe by Sea and lande, folowing Floradins councell (whose experience caried credite) departed in tyme, and trauailed towards Xaintes , and from Xaintes (whiche they supposed vnassured, as indeede it was soone after taken) they went to Saint John de Angeley , wher publication of so long desired peace was proclaymed, whiche caused them, laden with spoile (wherevnto as I haue sayde they were euer sharpe sette) as good seruitours to the king, to retire vnto the Castell of Floradin and Syrena , where with a common purse they purchased a Windmill for the Miller and hys wife, and gaue their landes, farmes and tenementes, in lease and occupying vnto their seruauntes in respecte of their good and faithfull seruice. Then after a thousande embracings, Claribel and his Margarite retourned to Poictiers vnto their house, wher they continued togither in perfect vnion, voide of all ielousie, vnto their liues ende. And in verification of my tale, I will not forget to reporte vnto you a Song, whiche yet at this daye men sing by parties, in memorie of their foolish youthfulnesse. to flowe from my faire Ladies face, As by hir to be vouched bounde, to serue as slaue, hir noble grace, My happy stare and settled minde possessed more contented stay, Than any liuing prince may finde, though all the world should him obay. So long as of a seruant true, the faithfull guage of loyall Loue Posseste my hart, and I did viewe his seruice soughte his faith to proue, I could not change this weale of mine, nor once reward hym with dispight, To be partaker with a Queene in worldly wealth and al delight. But after she had learnde to knowe, by vertue of hir looking glasse, The beautie whiche did worke my woe, and giues me cause to crie alas, I had no power my hope to aide by any meane, when I did viewe Another, whom my maistresse saide, should ioy the loue that was my due. But after this vnconstant wretche of other damoysells had a sighte, And sought by many a suttle fetche, to make them owners of my right: Aduaunting he coulde cull his choice, sufficiently to domage me, And with the fairest Dames reioyce, and please his wicked fantasie. Beholde what slender confidence remaineth in this slipper kinde, This is the goodly recompence, for seruing long a man shall finde, The loyaller his vsage is, more patiently he suffers paine, The greater torment shall be his, and lesse in fine shal be his gaine. Beholde whereto the promise tende of these dissembling liers all, That sweare and stare while life shall ende, to serue their dames at euery call: It is no more, but at their wills to seeke our bodies to abuse, VVhereof they vaunt and scoffe their fills, and finally do vs refuse. Therfore right happy shall he bee, and alwayes compted ware and wise, That can their seruile bondage flee, and shunne the snares of loues deuise: Vnhappy was the dismall daye, when firste my luckelesse desteny, Allotted my poore hearte, to praye vpon such cankerde miserie. Therefore suche creatures shall be bleste, as can eschue this flaming fire, And quite forbeare to be a gueste vnto this torment of desire. Treade not the trace that I haue gone, you honeste dames that dwell in ioy, Nowe subiecte vnto care and mone vnder the lawe of all annoye. But sith that force enforceth me, of force perforce to giue consent To loue and like my libertie, to liue therein I am content: For better (saith the prouerbe) late than neuer, Shunne the baite of bale, VVhiche moues oure wishes to debate, and dayly setteth peace at sale. But sith in time I muste prouide, perforce to arme my wofull harte, The cruell pearcing blowes to bide, that Cupid striketh with his darte: The hurte is hard to heale, some saye, that long is kepte from Surgeons cure, VVhiche warneth me to seeke the waye to ease the care that I endure. Yet if my cruell carelesse foe with pitifull repentante eie VVould yeelde to me, and to no moe, the happy state of amitie, Then woulde I dye to please hir minde, and aye embrace hir as my wife, My body restlesse shoulde she finde to do hir good, my terme of life. Yet if my faithlesse flitting friend, woulde finde a daye to come againe, And do his homage in the ende vnto our loue and aye remaine: I woulde with all my harte repent, that fortune falsed my beheste, And if he coulde be so content, my harte shoulde be his place of reste. Come then the comforte of my mind come then my solace and my ioye Betweene thy lilly armes come binde our loue thus wronged with annoy: Haste darling deare to salue the sore that long hath soughte to waste my harte, The griefe whereof wil gripe me more, excepte we kisse ere we departe. Come then my life and my desire, my wished spouse and wedded guage, The scorching flames and brainsicke fire, are quenched quite of iealous rage. I neuer will recite to thee, the thing that may displease thy mynde, So that thou wilt remaine to mee a carefull husband, and a kinde. Faire Dame, let vs performe the summe of al our passed auntient loue, And let vs spende oure life to come, in combate of this warre we proue: Alas when pale and earthly colde doth close vs in our fatall graue, Oure louing flames you maye be bolde, shall lose the heate that louers craue. My friend, our gallant youthfulnesse, and foolishe loue will waste awaye, VVhen feeble age our limmes shall presse, and bring our bodies to decaye: But sooner shall the flaming fire burne in the depth of raging Seas, Than euer we will wante desire, eche others louing minde to please. Thus (amiable company) our Claribel and Floradine , for that they had demeaned their youth very disordinately in lasciuious liuing, fell (by ye iustice of diuine destinie) into this desaster, to finde wiues according to their owne qualitie, and as men say, of the same leuine The which to shewe them selues in al thinges, and by all meanes like vnto their husbands, spared not, neither before nor after their mariage, to imitate them as their heades: vntill in fine seeing them amended, they also gouerned them selues within the bounds of the same modestie, putting off the vices of their passed liues. Wherein my saying seemeth very true,  & maketh sufficient proofe, that the quarels, mischeefes, & inconuenieces which happen in loue, proceed as wel of ye man as of the woman, who vnaduisedly doo open the gate vnto that domesticall enemie, cutting with the knife of iealousie and euil gouernement, the naked and indissoluble knotte of mariage loue: Accompting (through their owne wicked crimes) for a perpetuall miserie, the thing which of it selfe is most blessed in the world. Howe say you Madame, (sayd he vnto the Lady of the Castell) doo you not giue me your voyce? Wherevnto she answered: Truely, vnderstanding all your discourses, I finde you so well prouided of worthy reasons, as euery of you deserueth well the preheminence of the controuersie. But to set you at agreement, I will stay iudgement vntil to morowe morning, that in my course I may play my part, where following the tract you haue beaten before me, we will more profoundly discouer loue and his nature, bycause this disputation seemeth to me the most worthy and excellent, which may euer fall into the consideration of a noble spirite. And we will discipher Loue, not suche as the vulgar multitude make it, but a very perfect intelligence, and principall of all things, which some haue nominated, ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , videlicet , an vnitie of the diuinitie resident in our soule, as the light of the fire within the weike of a candle. And in deede it is truely the same fire whiche Prometheus stole away from the Poetes. And we well agree with them that haue deuided the soule into two distinctios, the one called Sensualitie, which is none other thing than a furnace of perturbations, passions, and disordinate appetites, for the ruling and subiection whereof by the bridle of reason, all the morall vertues are occupied: The other named vnderstanding, wherein is the residence of the contemplatiue vertues, whiche drawe man vnto the life and eternitie of God. Nowe in which of these partes of the soule shall we place Loue? To put it among the moral vertues it is no reason: for they serue to purge the soule, and loue is a function of a soule already purged. Then must we plant it among the contemplatiue vertues, and cheefly muste confesse Loue to be the most perfect vertue of the cotemplatiue vertues: bicause it is the true Whetstone to sharpen the spirituall cogitations, and to rayse them on high, to searche veritie. For I pray you, what thing doth eleuate the soule vnto contemplation, but onely the loue of trueth, kindling the spirite with a curiositie and insatiable desire, and leaueth it not in rest vntil it hath ledde it by degrees at last vnto perfect intelligence, which is the forme of formes, the blessed enioying wherof, by a certayne rauishmente engendreth this Philosophicall death, which Plato called his extasie? And it is no meruayle, if loue desireth fruition, sith it is the soueraigne benefite and felicitie thereof, the whiche can not communicate with grosse heades, borne but to doo seruice, and whose soule serueth to none other vse than for salte. But Loue requireth a soule Heroicall by nature, and well formed: whereby it appeareth, that the errour whereinto many haue entered, disputing of Loue, is growen, bicause they make it a passion, blinding the soule: And contrariwise, it is the thing that taketh away all obscuritie from vs, which would hinder vs to see to the quicke. Then they make it a good or euill qualitie, according to the good and euill disposition of the subiect, which is altogither false. For sith that euill proceedeth of the matter (the which as wise men say, euer resisteth diuinitie) and goodnesse commeth of the forme, it foloweth that Loue, which hath no corporall substaunce, eyther for the obiect or subiect, but is abstract and spirituall, ought to be alwayes good. And furthermore, Loue is none other thing than a desire of that which is good, and that good is none other thing than an instrument of the principall good, which is God, which hath moued some to say, that loue is a little sparke of the great and perfect loue of God. So as not without cause the moste sage and sanctified persons of the times past, called Philosophers, haue wished to beginne their names by Loue. Nowe we will remit this consideration vntill to morrowe, when with the light of veritie, we will searche in what parte loue is hidden, if it be in the hart, in the braine, or in the liuer. Then wherewith it is nourished, which be his true functions, when, and howe it is engendred, and what people it requireth to establishe his habitation, where all at our ease we will shew what Lady or louer it must choose not to be deceyued, and in fine, what is the duetie of the one and the other partie, to the ende that a good beginning may haue a better ende: not that loue hath euer any ende, for it is eternall, beeing of a diuine nature, and giuen vs from God here beneath, by the arrest of this glorious beatitude, the perfect fruition whereof attendeth suche aboue, as the heauenly grace hath rendered amorous of the seconde lyfe. The ende of the fifth Historie.
