 lesse painfull to followe a Fiddle in a gentlewomans chamber: then to marche after a Drumme in the feeld. And more sounde sleapyng vnder a silken Canapie cloase by a freend, then vnder a bushe in the open feelde, within a mile of our foe. And nothyng so daungerous to be wounded with the luryng looke of our beloued Mistres: as with the crewell shotte of our hatefull enemie, the one possest with a pitifull harte, to helpe where she hath hurte: the other with a deadly hate, to kill where thei might saue. Experience now hath taught me, that to bee of Mars his crewe, there is nothyng but paine, trauaill, tormoill, disquiet, colde, hunger, thriste, penurie, badde lodging, worse fare, vnquiet slepe, with a number of other calamities that haps I knowe not how. And when a Souldier hath thus serued in many a bloudie broile, a flappe with a Foxe taile shal bee his beste reward: for I see no better recompence that any of theim can gette. Now contrary to bee of Venus bande, there is pleasure, sporte, ioye, solace, mirthe, peace, quiet reste, daintie fare, with a thousande other delites, suche as I can not rehearse. And a man hauyng serued but a reasonable tyme, maie sometymes take a taste at his Mistres lippes, for his better recompence. But now (gentlewomen) as I haue vowed my self to bee at your dispositions, so I knowe not how to frame my self to your contentations, when I consider, with how many commendable qualities he ought to bee endued, that should bee welcomed into your blessed companies: I finde in my self no one maner of exercise, that might giue me the least hope to win your good likinges. As firste for Dauncyng, although I like the Measures verie well, yet I could neuer treade them a right, nor to vse measure in any thyng that I went aboute, although I desired to performe all thynges by line and by leauell, what so euer I tooke in hande. Our Galliardes are so curious, that thei are not for my dauncyng, for thei are so ful of trickes and tournes, that he whiche hath no more but the plaine Sinquepace, is no better accoumpted of then a verie bongler, and for my part, thei might assone teach me to make a Capricornus, as a Capre in the right kinde that it should bee. For a Ieigge my heeles are too heauie: And these braules are so busie, that I loue not to beate my braines about them. A Rounde is too giddie a daunce for my diet, for let the dauncers runne about with as muche speede as thei maie: yet are thei neuer a whit the nier to the ende of their course, vnlesse with often tourning, thei hap to catch a fall. And so thei ende the daunce with shame, that was begonne but in sporte. These Hornepipes I haue hated from my verie youth: and I knowe there are many other that loues them as euill as I. Thus you maie perceiue that there is no dauce, but either I like not of theim, or thei like not of me, so that I can daunce neither. There resteth then, if I could plaie of any Instrumente, or that I had any sight in songe, whereby I might delight your daintie eares, (Gentlewomen) by sweete plaiyng or fainyng some pretie Dities. But to the firste, my fingers would neuer be brought in frame: for the seconde my mouthe is so vnpleasaunt, either to syng, or to faigne, as would rather breede your loathyng then your liking. Why yet if I could discourse pleasauntly to driue awaie the tyme, with amourous deuises, or that my conceipte would serue me, either to propone pretie questions, or to giue readie aunsweres: with a number of other delightes, to long to be rehearsed, there were some comfort, that I might bee alowed of emongst you. But my capacitie is so grosse, my wittes bee so blunt, and all my other sences are so dulle: that I am sure you would soner condemne me for a Dunce, then confirme me for a Disciple, fit to whisper a tall in a Gentlewomans eare. But yet I truste (Gentlewomen) when you shall perceiue the zeale that I beare to my newe profession: although you will not presently admit me to the Pulpit, yet you will not denaie me, to be one of your Parishe. Where if it please you, but to place me in the bodie of the Churche, you shall finde my deuotion as muche as he that kneles next the Chauncell doore. And here (Gentlewomen) the better to manifest, the farther regarde of my duetie: I haue presented you with a fewe rough heawen Histories. Yet I dare vndertake so warely polished, that there is nothyng let slipp, that might breede offence to your modest myndes. I haue made bolde, to publishe theim vnder your sauecundites, and I trust it shall nothyng at all offende you: My last request is, that at your pleasures you will peruse theim, and with your fauours you will defende them, whiche if I maie perceiue, not to bee misliked of emongest you, my encouragement will bee suche, that I trust within a verie shorte space, you shall see me growe from a yong Punie, to a sufficient Scholer. And thus (gentlewomen) wishyng to you all, what your selues do beste like of, I humbly take my leaue. Yours in the waie of honestie Barnabe Riche. Barnabe Riche wisheth as to hym self. better to be happie the wise, but what it is to bee happie, how should I discipher, who neuer in my life could yet attaine to any happe at all that was good, and yet I haue had Souldiours lucke and speede as well as the reste of my profession. And with wisedome I will not meddle, I neuer came where it grewe, but this I dare boldly affirme (& the experience of the present tyme doeth make daiely proofe) that wit standes by in a thredbare coate, where folly sometyme sittes in a Veluet goune, and how often is it seen, that vice shall be aduaunced, where vertue is little or naught at all regarded, small deserte shall highly bee preferred, where well doyng shall goe vnrewarded, and flatterie shall be welcomed for a guest of greate accompt, where plaine Tom tell troth, shall be thrust out of doores by the shoulders: and to speake a plaine truthe in deede, doe ye not see, Pipers, Parysites, Fidlers, Dauncers, Plaiers, Iesters, and suche others, better esteemed and made of, and greater beneuolence vsed tovvarde them, then to any others that indeuours themselues to the moste commendable qualities. Then seeyng the abuse of this present age is suche, that follies are better esteemed then matters of greater waight: I haue stept on to the Stage amongst the reste, contented to plaie a part, and haue gathered together this small volume of Histories, all treatyng (sir reuerence of you) of loue. I remember that in my last booke intituled the Allarum to Englande , I promised to take in hande some other thyng, but beleeue me, it was not this that I ment for I pretended then to haue followed on, and where I ended with the decaie of Marciall discipline, so I ment to haue begun againe with the Disciplines of Warre, and with all to haue set forthe the orders of sondrie battailles, and the maner of Skirmiges; with many plattes of fortification: but especially those of the lowe Countrirs, as Delfte, Delftes Hauen, Roterdame, Leiden, the Breylle, bothe the hedde and the Toune Gorcoum, Gouldfluce, Maaselandefluce, the Crympe, with diuerse others worthie the perusyng, for suche as haue not seen them. But I see the tyme serues not for any suche thyng to bee accoumpted of. And therefore to fitte the tyme the better, I haue putte forthe these louyng Histories, the which I did write in Irelande at a vacant tyme, before the commyng ouer of Iames Fitz Morice: And it pleased me the better to doe it, onely to keepe my self from Idelnesse, and yet thei saie, it were better to be Idle then ill occupied. But I truste I shall please Gentlewomen, and that is all the gaine that I looke for. And herein I doe but followe the course of the worlde. For many now adaies goe aboute by as great deuise as maie bee, how thei might become women theimselues. How many Gentlemen shall you see at this present daie, that I dare vndertake, in the wearyng of their apparell, in the settyng of their Ruffes, and the freselyng of their heire, are more new fangeled and foolishe, then any curtisan of Venice. And I beseche you (Gentlemen) giue me leaue to tell you a tale, that comes euen now in my mynde: the matter is not worthe the hearyng, but yet very straunge vnto me at the first. It was my fortune at my last beyng at London, to walke through the Strande towardes Westminster, where I mett one came ridyng towardes me, on a footeclothe Nagge, apparailed in a Frenche Ruffe, a Frenche Cloake, a Frenche Hose, and in his hande a greate fanne of Feathers, bearyng them vp (verie womanly) against the side of his face: And for that I had neuer seen any man weare theim before that daie, I beganne to thinke it vnpossible, that there might a manne bee founde so foolishe, as to make hym self a scorne to the worlde, to weare so womanish a toye. But rather thought it had been some shamelesse woman, that had disguised her self like a manne, in our Hose, and our Cloakes: for our Dublettes, Gounes, Cappes and Hattes thei had got long agoe. But by this tyme he was come some thyng nire me, and I might see he had a bearde, whereby I was assured that he should haue been a manne, whereat I beganne to muse with my self, whether his simplicitie were more to be pitied, or his follie more to be laughed at. For in myne opinion, it is as fonde a sight to see a manne with suche a bable in his hande, as to see a woman ride through the streate with a launce in hers. And as he passed by me, I sawe three followyng that were his menne, and taking the hindermoste by the arme, I asked hym what Gentlewoman his maister was: but the fellowe not vnderstandyng my meanyng, tolde me his maisters name, and so departed. I beganne then to muse with my self, to what ende that fanne of Feathers serued, for it could not bee to defende the Sunne from the burnyng of his beautie, for it was in the beginnyng of Februarie, when the heate of the sunne maie bee very well indured. Now if it were to defende the winde, or the coldnesse of the aire, my thinke a Frenche hoode had been a great deale better, for that had been bothe gentlewomanlike, and beyng close pinde doune aboute his eares, would haue kepte his hedde a greate deale warmer. And then a Frenche hoode on his hedde, a Frenche Ruffe aboute his necke, a French Cloake on his backe, and a paire of French Hose on his legges had been right. A la mode de Fraunce: & this had bin somethyng sutable to his witte. But I thinke he did it rather to please Gentlewomen, and the better to shewe what honor he bare theim, would weare one of the greatest vanities that long to their sexe. And to this ende (Gentlemen) I haue tolde you my tale, that you might perceiue the sundrie meanes we vse, and all to please women. I see it is the pathe that all desires to pace, and sure I would wishe my frendes to tread the same trace. For what is he that is wise, whiche desires to be a Souldiour: Mars his Court, is full of bale. Venus is full of blisse. And my good componions and fellowe Souldiours, if you will followe myne aduise, laie aside your weapons, hang vp your armours by the walles, and learne an other while (for your better aduauncements) to Pipe, to Feddle, to Syng, to Daunce, to lye to forge, to flatter, to cary tales, to set Ruffe, or to dooe any thyng that your appetites best serues vnto, and that is better fittyng for the tyme. This is the onely meane that is best for a man to bryng hymself in credite: Otherwise I knowe not whiche waies a man might bende hymself, either to gett gaine or good report. For first the Militarie profession, by meanes whereof menne were aduaunced to the greatest renowne, is now become of so slender estimation, that there is no accompt neither made of it, nor any that shall professe it. To become a Courtier, there is as little gaines to be gotten, for Liberalitie, who was wont to be a principall officer, as well in the Court as in the Countrey, by whose meanes wel doyng could neuer go vnrewarded. Is tourned Iacke out to office, and others appoincted to haue the custodie of hym to hold him short, that he range no more abroad, so that no ma can speake with hym. And thei saie, the poore Gentleman, is so fleest from tyme to tyme, by those that bee his keepers, that he hath nothing to giue that is good, but it falls to their shares. To become a Studient in the Lawe, there are suche a number of theim already, that me thinkes it is not possible, that one of theim should honestly thriue by an other. And some will saie that one Lawyer, and one Goshauke, were enough in one Shire. But of my conscience, there are more Lawyers in some one Shire in Englande, with Attorrneis, Solicitours, or as thei are termed brokers of causes, or Pettie foggers: then there are Goshaukes in all Norwaie. To become a Marchaunt, tra'fique is so dead, by meanes of these foraine broiles, that vnlesse a man would be a theefe to his Countrey to steale out prohibited wares, there were small gaines to be gotten. To become a Farmer, Landes be so racked at suche a rate, that a manne should but toyle all the daies of his life, to paie his Landlordes rent. But what occupation or handy craft, might a man then followe to make hym selfe riche: when euery Science dependes vpon new fangled fashions. For he that to daie is accompted for the finest workeman, within one moneth, some newe found fellowe comes out vvith some newe found fashion: and then he beares the prise, and the first accoumpted but a bungler. And within an other moneth after, the second shall be serued with the same sauce: and thus there is no Artificer that can hold his credite long. Such is the miserable condition of this our present tyme, this is the course of the worlde: but especially here in Englande. Where there is no man thought to be wise, but he that is wealthy: where no man is thought to speake a truth, but suche as can lie, flatter and dissemble. Where there is no aduise allowed for good, but suche as tendeth more for gaine then for glorie. And what pinchyng for a penie, that should be spent in our Countries defence? How prodigall for a pound, to be spent vpon vanities & idle deuises? What small recompence to Souldiors, that fightes with foes for their Countries quiet? How liberall to Lawyers, that settes frendes at defiaunce, and disquietes a whole Common wealthe? What faunyng vppon hym whom Fortune doeth aduaunce? What frounyng on hym whom she hath brought lowe? What little care of the poore and suche as be in want? What feastyng of the riche, and suche as be wealthy? What sumptuous houses built by men of meane estate? What little hospitalitie kept from high and lowe degree. And here I can not but speake of the bountie of that noble Gentleman sir Christofer Hatton, my verie good Maister and vpholder: who hauyng builded a house in Northampton Shire, called by the name of Holdenby. Whiche house for the brauerie of the buildynges, for the statelinesse of the chabers, for the riche furniture of the Lodginges, for the conueighance of the offices, and for all other necessaries appertenent to a Pallas of pleasure: Is thought by those that haue iudgement, to be incomparable, and to haue no fellowe in Englande, that is out of her Maiesties handes: and although this house is not yet fully finished, and is but a newe erection, yet it differeth farre from the workes that are vsed now adaies in many places. I meane where the houses are builte with a greate number of Chimneis, and yet the smoke comes forthe but at one onely tunnell. This house is not built on that maner, for as it hath sundrie Chimneis, so thei cast forthe seuerall smokes: and suche worthie porte, and daiely hospitalitie kepte, that although the owner hym self vseth not to come there once in twoo yeares, yet I dare vndertake, there is daiely prouision to be founde conuenient, to entertaine any noble manne with his whole traine, that should hap to call in of a sodaine. And how many Gentlemen and straungers, that comes but to see the house, are there daiely welcomed, feasted, and well lodged. From whence should he come, be he riche, bee he poore, that should not there bee entertained, if it please hym to call in. To bee short, Holdenby giueth daiely relief to suche as bee in wante, for the space of sixe or seuen miles compasse. Peraduenture those that be enuious, will thinke this tale nothyng appertinent to the matter, that I was in hand with all, but I trust my offence is the lesse, considering I haue spoken but a truthe: and doe wishe that euery other man were able to saie as muche for his maister, and so an ende. And now where I lefte of I was tellyng, what Pride, what Coueteousnesse, what Whooredome, what Glotonie, what Blasphemie, what Riot, what Excesse, what Dronkennesse, what Swearyng, what Briberie, what Extortio, what Vsurie, what Oppression, what Deceipte, what Forgerie, what vice in generall is daiely entertained, and practized in Englande. And although it hath pleased God by wonderfull signes and miracles, to forewarne vs of his wrathe, and call vs to repentaunce, yet you see the worlde runneth forewardes, & keepeth his wonted course, without any remorse of conscience, neither making signe, nor proffer to amende. But like as we see an old sore beyng once ouer run, will not be cured with any moderate medicine, but must be eaten with corosiues till it comes to the quicke: and like as wee saie, one poison must bee a meane, to expell an other. So what should wee othewise thinke of our selues, but if wee bee growne to suche extreamitie, as no gentill admonition will serue to reclaime vs: vvhat other thyng should we looke for, but a mischief to be the Medicine: God will not suffer that vice shall alwaies florishe, he will surely roote it out at the laste. And how long hath he alredy borne with vs in our wickednesse? And what reformation is there had emongest vs? vnlesse it be to go from euill to worse. But if we did duely consider, how mercifully he hath still dealt with vs, how fauourably he hath preserued vs? and how wonderfully he hath defended vs? I thinke we should not be (altogether) so vnthankefull as we shewe our selues to bee. For who knoweth not what an eye sore, this little Ile of Englande, hath been to the whole worlde, and how long haue we liued (as it were) in contempt of suche Countries as be our nexte neighbours: who still enueighyng our quiet and happie gouernment: haue practized by as many deuises as thei could, to bring vs into their owne predicament, had it not been the onely prouidence of GOD that preserued vs. Or what freendship might we yet hope to finde at any of their hands: if their oportunitie would serue them to be reuenged of the dispite, which long agoe thei had conceiued against vs. First the Frenche hath euer been our enemies by Nature. The Scottes by custome. The Spanyardes for Religion. The Duche although we haue stoode them in great steade, and holpe the at many a pinche: yet I could buye as muche freendshipp as thei doe all owe vs, for a barrell of Englishe Beere. If we should goe any further, then wee come to the Pope, the Turke, and the Deuill, & what frendship thei beare vs, I thinke euery one can Imagine. And here we might consider how wonderfully God hath wrought on our behalfes, and with all humblenesse of harte, giue hym daiely thankes, for his benefites bestowed vpon vs, but moste of all, and especially, for our moste gracious and Soueraigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth, who from tyme to time he hath so mightily preserued, to be the verie instrumente of his mercie, and louyng kindnesse towardes vs: and for whose sake (no doubt) he hath forborne vs in his displeasure, as many tymes he did the children of Israell, at the request of his seruaunt Moyses. First how was she assaulted in her sisters tyme, by those rauenyng Wolues, that daiely sought her death: for thei all stoode in doubt, that she should bee that Iudith, whiche should cut of Holofernes his hedde. And it pleased Gd to bryng it euen so to passe: not onely defendyng her from their crueltie and rage, but raised her vp (in deede) to the vtter subuersion of those blondie Butchers, and to the greate comfort of vs all, that were in bondage, and subiect to tyrannie. Not onely setting vs free, fro those detestable enormities, that so corosiued our cosciences, but made open waie & passage, for the worde of God freely to be published (I thinke) to our owne destruction, that so vnworthely receiue it. Vppon this, how many mightie enemies protested against her, and what harme haue any of them been able to doe her. And how many treasons and priuie conspiracies (sith that tyme) hath been practised by our peltyng Papistes against her. But God hath reuealed and brought them to light. Let vs therefore praie vnto GOD, that he would so lengthen her daies, that we might still enioye so gracious a Princes, long to gouerne and reigne ouer vs. And that from tyme to tyme, he would so directe her Noble Counsaill, in all their meetynges and consultations, as maie redounde to his glorie, to the benefite of their Countrey, and to their owne immortall fame. Let vs likewise praie, that God would roote suche couetuous hartes out of Englande, that for the sparyng of a penie for the present tyme: care not to let slippe suche matter, as maie coste many a pounde here after this. Now lastly, and as Mariners vse to syng at the Sea, God saue my Mate and me also: And GOD sende all Souldiours that hath honestly serued their Countrey, better consideration then of long tyme thei haue had. And thus noble Souldiours and Gentlemen all, I haue heeld you with a long Sermon, neither can I tell how my preachyng will bee allowed of: I craue no more, but wishe you all better Fortune then I knowe the present tyme will afforde you, and so will rest at your disposition. Barnabe Riche. I assure thee (gentle reader) whe I first tooke in hande to write these discourses, I meante nothyng lesse then to put theim in print, but write theim at the request of some of my dearest freds, sometymes for their disporte, to serue their priuate vse. And now againe by greate importunitie, I am forsed to sende the al to the Printer. The Histories (altogether) are eight in nuber, whereof, the first, the seconde, the fift, the seuenth and eight, are tales that are but forged onely for delight, neither credible to be beleued, nor hurtfull to be perused. The third, ye fourth, and the sixt: are Italia Histories, written likewise for pleasure by maister L. B. And here getill reader, I must instauntly intreate thee, that if thou findest any wordes or tearmes, semyng more vndecent, than peraduenture thou wilte like of: thinke that I haue set them doune, as more apropriate to expresse the matter thei intreate of, then either for want of iudgement, or good maners. Trustyng that as I haue written them in Jest, so thou wilt read them but to make thy self merie. I wishe thei might as well please thee in the reading, as thei displease me in puttyng them forthe. I bid thee hartely farewell. Barnabe Riche. Must aske consent of worthie vertues grace: To her belonges the staulement of the croune, She yeeldes all those their iust deserued place. As tred her path and runne her royall race: Suche Riche rewardes to eache, she yeeldes eache where As might become this worthie Riche to weare. The painfull man that tilles his grounde, reapes frute, Eache merrit hath his meede, paine hath his hire: Deserte requires that fame should not stande mute, Where wisedome doeth to vertues waies aspire. The hope of gaine doeth set mens hartes on fire, Then yeeld hym thankes, that erst hath vndertooke, For thy delight to penne this little booke. Let Momus mates chat on, in their dispight, Let wranglers wreake and wrest the worst thei maie: The wisest sorte will iudge and take delight, Though ianglyng iayes that knowe not what thei saie: Will oftentymes their witlesse wittes bewraie, Yet Riche shall reape, what he by right hath wonne, Deserued praise for that whiche here is doen. Finis. [quoth]. VV. I. Gent. Or worthie merrit, guerdon haue: Why should not Riche presse forth hym self, The louely laurell croune to craue: Whose life in fielde that wonne hym praise, He leades at home in Pallas waies. Skorne not then Zoylus his good happe, That can his will subdue and tame: But trie to treade his path whereby, Thou maiest thy life with vertue frame: Alowe his paine, and penne to wright, Who naught pretendes but thy deligth. Loe he who wonted was in fielde, To meete his furious foe in face: Hath scalde Parnassus hill where he, Attendes Mineru' her noble grace. And there his penne doeth plaie his parte, As did els where his shielde and darte. Finis. [quoth]. B. S. Who shall vpon hym light: The spraulyng Spider turnes to gaule, The Bee to honey right. So fares it with this booke, whose leaues Are open spred to thee: Make choise good Reader of the best, Sucke honey with the Bee. Misconster not eache merrie phraise, Deeme not the worst of it: Whiche is not pende to doe thee hurte, But recreate thy wit. And for suche faultes as scaped haue The presse, whereof thers store: Reproue the Printer for his haste, Blame not the booke therefore. But as by mirth tis meant to moue, Thy mynde to some delight: Rewarde his paine with praise, whiche did These pleasaunt Stories wright.
