 the aduocate greatly hyndrethe and apeyreth his clyentes cause. Lykewyse the vnapte dysposycyon of the precher in orderynge his mater confundyth the memory of hys herers. And bryefly indeclaryng of maters for lake of inuencyon and order with due elocucyo greate tediosnes is engendred to the multytude beynge present/ by occasyon where of the speker is many tymes or he haue endyd his tale eyther lefte almost alone to his no lytle confusyo or els whiche is a lyke rebuke to hym the audyence falleth for werynes of hys ineloquent langage faste on slepe. Wyllynge therfore for my parte to helpe suche as ar desyrous of this arte as all surely ought to be whiche entende to be regarded in any comynaltye/I haue partely traunslatyd out of a werke of Rhethoryke wrytten in the lattyn tongue and partely compyled of myne owne & so made a lytle treatise in maner of an introduccyon into this afore said scyence and that in the englysshe tongue. Remembrynge that euery goode thynge after the sayenge of the Phylosopher the more commune that it is the better it is. And further more trustynge there by to do some pleasure and ease to suche as haue by neclygence or els false parsuasyons be put to the lernynge of other scyences or euer they haue attayned any meane knowledge of the latyne tonge. Whyche my sayde labour I humbly offer to your good lordeshyppe as to the chyefe mayntener and norissher of my stody besechynge you though it be ferre within your merytes done to me to accepte it as the fyrste assay of my pore and symple wyt whych if it maye fyrst please your lordeshyppe. And next the reders I truste by the ayde of almyghty god to endight other werkes both in this facultye and other to the laude of ye hyghe godhed of whom all goodnes dothe procede and to your lordeshyppes pleasure and to profyte and delectacyon of the reder. Whosomeuer desyreth to be a good oratour or to dyspute and comune of any maner thynge/hym behoueth to haue foure thynges. The fyrste is called Inuencyon for he muste fyrste of al imagyne or inuent in his mynde what he shall saye. The ii. is named iudgement/for he muste haue wyt to discerne and iudge whether tho thinges that he hathe founde in his mynde be conuenient to the purpose or nat/for often tymes yf a man lake thys propriete he may as well tell that that is agaynste hym/as with him/as experience doth dayly shew. The. iii. is dysposycyon wherby he maye knowe howe to ordre and set euery thynge in his due place. Leste thoughe his inuencyon and iudgement be neuer so goode he maye happen to be counted as the comune prouerbe sayeht To put the carte afore the horse. The. iiii. & is such thynges laste as he hathe Inuentid and by iudgement knowen apte to his purpose when they ar set in theyr ordre so to speke them that it maye be pleasant and delectable to the audience. So that it maye be sayde of hym that historyes make mencion that an olde woman sayde ons by demosthenes and syns hathe bene a comune prouerbe amoge the grekes whiche is asmoch to saye as this is he. And this last propriete is callyd amonge lernyd men eloquence. Of these .iiii. the most difficile or harde is to inuente what thou muste saye wherfore of this parte the Rhetoryciens whiche be maysters of this arte haue written very moche and diligently. Inuencyon is coprehendid in certayn placys/as the Rhetoriciens call the/out of who he that knoweth the facultye may fetche easyly suche thynges as be mete for the mater that he shal speke of/which mater the Oratour callethe the theme and in oure vulgayre tonge it is callyd improprely the antytheme. The theme proposed we muste after the rules of Rhetoryke go to oure placys that shal anone shew vnto vs what shalbe to oure purpose. Exaple in olde tyme there was grete enuy betwene .ii. noble men of Rome of whome the one was callyd Mylo/and the other Clodyus. The which malice grew so ferre that Clodius layed wayte for Mylo on a season when he shulde ryde out of the cyte/ and in his iournay set vpon him and there as it chansyd Clodius was slayne/where vpon thys Clodius frendes accused Milo to the Senate of murdre. Tully whiche in tho dayes was a grete aduocate in Rome shulde plede Miloes cause. Nowe it was opyn that Milo had slayne Clodius/but whether he had slaine him laufully or nat was the doute. So the theme of Tullyes oracyon or plee for Milo was thys that he had slayne Clodius laufully/and therfore he ought nat to be punisshed. For the confirmacyon wherof as dothe appere in Tullyes oracyon he dyd brynge out of placis of Rhetoryke argumentes to proue his sayde theme or purpose. And lykewise muste we do when we haue any mater to speke or commune of. As yf I shulde make an oracyon to the laude and prayse of the Kynges hyghnesse/I muste for the Inuecyon of suche thynges as be for my purpose/ go to places of Rhetoryke/where I shal easly fynde after I knowe the rules/that that I desyre. Here is to be noted ye there is no theme but it is conteined vnder one of .iiii.causis/or for the more playnes .iiii. kyndes of oracions. The fyrste is callyd Logycall whyche kynde we call properly disputacio. The secude is callid Demostratyue. The thyrde Delyberatyue. The .iiii. Judiciall/and these thre laste be properly callid speces or kindes of oracions/whose natures shalbe declarid seperatly here after with the crafte that is required i euery of them. All themes that parteyne to Logike eyther they be Symple or copounde as yf aman desyre to knowe of me what Iustice is/this only thynge Iustice is my theme/Or yf disputacyon be had in any company vpon Relygion/and I wold declare the very nature of Religion/my theme shulde be thys symple or one thynge Relygyon. But yf it be douted whether Iustice be a vertue or nat/and I wolde proue the part affyrmatyue/my theme were now compounde/that is to say/Iustice is a vertue. For it is made of .ii. thynges knyte or vnied togither/Iustice and/vertu Here must be noted that Logike is a playne and asure way to instructe a man of the trouth of euery thynge. And that in it the natures causes partis and effectes of thinges ar by certayne rules discussid and serchyd out/So that nothinge can be perfectly and propryely knowen but by rules of Logike whiche is nothynge but an obseruacyon or a diligent markynge of nature/ wherby in euery thynge mannes reason dothe consyder what is fyrste/what laste/ what propre/what impropre. The places or instrumentes of a symple theme ar. The definicion of the thyng. The causes. The partes. The effctes. Iustice is/wherof it cometh/what partes it hathe/and what is the offyce or effecte of euery parte/then haste thou diligently serched out ye hole nature of Iustice. And handelyd thy symple theme accordynge to the preceptes of Logeciens/To whome oure author leuith suche maters to be discussyd of them. Howe be it somwhat the Rhetoriciens haue to do with the symple theme/and asmoch as shalbe for theyr entent we wyl shew hereafter. For many tymes the orator must vse bothe diffinicions and diuisions. But as they be in Logyke playne and compendiouse/So are they in Rhetorike extendid & paynted with many fygures and ornamentes longynge to the science. Neuertheles to satisfie the reders mynde and to alleuiate the tediousnes of serchynge these places I wyll opyn the maner and fasshyon of the handilynge of the theme afore sayd as playnely as I can after the preceptes of Logike/fyrst to serche out the perfyght knowlege of Iustyce I go to my fyrst place definicion/And fetche fro Aristotle in his ethikes the definicion of Iustyce whiche is this/Iustyce is a morall vertue wherby men be the werkers of ryghtful thinges/that is to say/wherby they both loue & also do such thinges as be Iuste. Thys done I serche the cause of Iustyce that is to saye fro whens it toke the fyrst begynning and bycause that it is a morall vertue and Plato in the ende of his dialogue Menon concludeth that all vertue commyth of god I am assured that god is the chefe cause of Iustice declaring it to the worlde by his instrument mannes wyt whiche the same Plato affyrmythe in the begynning of his lawes. The definicyon and cause had I come to the thyrde place callid partes to knowe whether ther be but one kynde of Iustice or els many. And for thys purpose I fynde that Aristotele in the .v. of his ethikes deuideth Iustice in .ii. speces or kyndes/one that he calleth Iustice legitime or legall/and an other whyche he called equyte. Iustyce legall/ is that/that consistith in the superyours whiche haue power to make or statute lawes to the inferiours/and the offyce or ende of this Iustyce is to make suche lawes as be bothe good and accordynge to ryght and conscience/and then to declare them/ and whe they are made and publysshed as they ought to be/to se that they be put in vre. For what auayleth it to make neuer so good lawes if they be nat obseruyd and kepte/and fynally that the maker of the lawe apply his hole studye and mynde to the welth of his subiectes and to the commune profyte of them. The other kynde of Iustice whiche men call equite is wherby a man nother taketh nother giueth/les nor more then he ought/but in gyuyng taketh good hede that euery man haue accordyng as he deseruith: This eqte is agayne deuidid into equite distributyue of comune thynges & equite Comutatyue/by equite distributyue is distributyd & gyuen of Comune goodes to euery man accordyng to his deseruinges & as he is worthy to haue. As to deuyde amonges suche as longe to the churche of the churche goodes after the qualyte of theyr merytes and to them that be cyuyle persones of the commune tresour of the cyte accordynge as they are worthy. In this parte is comprehendyd the punyshment of mysdoers and transgressours of the lawe/to whome correccio muste be distrybuted for the comune wele accordynge to theyr demerytes after prescryptions of lawes of the contrey made and determynyd for the punyshement of any maner transgressour. Equite comutatyue is a iuste maner in the chaungyng of thynges from one to an other whose offyce or effecte is to kepe iuste dealynge in equite as byenge/sellynge and all other bargaines lauful/and so are here with the speces of Iustyce declared. Oure auctour also in a grete worke that he hathe made vpon Rhetoryke declareth the handelyng of a theme symple by the same example of Iustice addynge. ii. places mo whiche ar callyd affynes and cotraies on this maner What is Iustice. Auertu wherby to euery thynge is gyuen that that to it belongyth/ What is the causetherof manes wyll consenting with lawes and maneres how many kyndes. ii. whiche. Commutatyue and distributyue/For iii. ii. maeres is our medlynge with other men other in thynges of our substance and/wares or in gentyll and cyuyle conuersacyon. What thyng is Iustyce comutatyue/ ryght and equite in all contractes. What is Iustyce distributyue/Iustyce of cyuyle lyuyng how manyfolde is Iusti/ ce distributyue/eyther it is commune/or pryuate/The commune is callyd in latin pietas/but in englysshe it may be moste properly namyd goode ordre whiche is the coroune of all vertues coseruynge honeste & cyuyle conuersacyon of men togyther/as the heddes wt the meane comynalte in good vnite & cocorde. Priuate or seueral/iustice distributyue is honeste & amyable frendeshype/ and conuersacyon of neyghbours. What are the offyces. To do for euery man ryche or pore of what someuer state he be and for our contrey/for our wyues/ chyldre and frendes that that ought to be done for euery of them. Affynes or vertues nyghe to Iustyce are Constancie/Lyberalyte/Temperaunce/ Thynges contrary ar fere/couytyse/prodigalyte. And this is the maner of handelynge of a simple theme dialectual. But yet let not the reder deceyue hym selfe/and thynke that the very perfyght knowlege it shewyd hym here/what hathe bene shewyd now is some what generall and brefe More sure and exacte knowledge is conteyned in Logyke/to whome I wyll aduise them that be studyouse to resorte and to fetche euery thyng in his one proper faculte Euery theme compounde eyther it is prouyd true or false. Nowe whether thou wylt proue or improue any thinge it muste be done by argument. And any theme compounde be it Logycall or Rhetorycall/ it muste be referryd to the rules of Logike by the to be prouyd true or false For thys is the dyfference that is betwene these two sciencis/that the Logycyan in disputynge obseruythe certayne rules for the settynge of his wordes beynge solycytous that ther be spokyn no more nor no les then the thynge requirith/and that it be eue as playnly spoke as it is thought But the Rhetoricyan seketh abought and boroweth wher he can asmuche as he may for to make the symple and playne Logycall argumentes gay and delectable to the aere so then the sure Iudgement of argumentes or reasons muste be lernyd of the Logicyan but the crafte to set them out with plesaunte fygures and delate the matter longith to the Rhetorycian/as in Myloes cause whom was made mecyon afore A logician wolde bryefly argue/who so euer violently wyll flee an other/may lawfully of the other be slayne in his defence. Clodius wolde vyolently haue slayn Milo/ wherfore Clodius might lafully be slayne of Milo in Milous owne defence. And this argument the logiciens call a Sillogisme in Darn/whiche Tully in his oracion extendeth that in foure or fyue leues it is scant made an ende of/nor no man can haue knowlege whether Tullies argumet that he maketh in his oracyon for Milo/ be a goode argument or nat/and howe it holdeth/excepte he can by Logyke reduce it to the perfecte and briefe forme of a Sillogisme/ takynge in the meane season of the Rhetorycyans what ornamentes haue bene caste so for to lyght and augmet the oracyon/and to gyue it a maiestie. The places out of whome are founde argumentes for the prouinge or improuynge of compoude Themes/ are these folowinge ------ Of the places of argumentes shalbe spoken hereafter. For as touchynge them in all thynges the Rhetorician and Logycian do agre. But as concernynge the crafte to fourme argumetes wha thou hast foude the in theyr places/that must be lerned of the Logician/where he treateth of the fourme of Sellogismes/Enthimemes and Iuductions. The vse of an oracion demonstratiue is in prayse or dysprayse/whiche kynde or maner of oracyon was greatly vsed somtyme in comon accyons/as dothe declare the oracyons of Demosthenes/ and also many of Thucidides oracios And there ben thre maners of oracions demonstratyue. The fyrst conteyneth the prayse or dysprayse of persones. As yf a man wolde prayse the kynges hyghnes or dysprayse some yl persone/it must be done by an oracyon demonstratyue. The secunde kynde of an oracyon demonstratyue is: where in is praysed or dispraised/nat the person but the dede. As yf a thefe put hym selfe in ieoperdy for the safegarde of a true man/agaynste other theues and murderers/the person can nat be praysed for his vicious lyuynge/but yet the dede is worthy to be commended. Or if one shulde speake of Peters denyenge of Christe/he hath nothynge to dysprayse the person saue onely for this dede. The thyrde kynde is: wherin is lauded or blamed nother person nor dede/ but some other thynge as vertue/vice/iustice/ iniurie/charite/enuie/pacience/wrothe and suche lyke. The partes of an oracion prescribed of Rhetoriciens are these. The Preamble or exorden. The tale or narracion. The prouinge of the matter or contencion. The conclusion. Of the whiche partes mencyon shall be made hereafter in euery kynde of oracions for they are nat founde generally in euery oracion/but some haue moo partes/and some lesse. Generally the Preamble nat alonly in an oracion demonstratiue/but also in the other two is conteyned and must be fetched out of thre places/that is to say of beneuolence/attencion/ & to make the mater easy to be knowen/whiche the Rhetoricians call Docilite. Beneuolence is the place whereby the herer is made willyng to here vs/and it is conteyned in the thynge that we speke of/ in them whom we speke to/ & in our owne person. The easyest and moste vsed place of beneuolence consysteth in the offyce or duety of the person/whan we shew that it is oure duety to do that we be aboute. Out of this place is set the preamble of saynte Gregory Nazazene/made to the prayse of saint Basyl/where he sayth that it is his duety to prayse saynt Basyll for thre causes. For the grate loue and frendeshype that hath ben always betwene the/ and agayne for the remembraunce of the moste fayre and excellent vertues that were in hym/and thyrdely that the churche myght haue an example of a good & holy Bysshop. Trewly by our authours lycence me thynketh that in the preable Nazazen doth nat only take beneuolece out of the places of his owne person/but also out of ye other two/whan he sheweth the cause of hys duetye/for in praysynge his frende he dyd but his duetye. In praysynge hys vertues/he cam to the place of beneuolece of hym that he spake of/as touchynge the example that the churche shulde haue/it was for theyr profyte/and concernyng the place of beneuolence/taken of them that he spake to. But our authour regarded chyefly the principall proposycyon/which was that saynt Gregory Nazazene was bounde to prayse saynt Basyll. A lyke example of beneuolence taken out of the place of offyce or duety/is in the oracyon that Tully made for the Poete Archyas/whiche begynneth thus. My lordes that be here iuges/yf there be in me any wyt/whiche I knowe is but small/or yf I haue any crafty use of makynge an oracion/wherin I denye nat but that I haue merely excercised my selfe or yf any helpe to that scyence cometh out of other lyberall artes/in whome I haue occupied all my lyfe/surely I am boude to no man more for them than to Archyas/ which may lawfully if I may do any man any profyte by the/chalenge a chyefe porcyon for him therin. Out of this place dyd thys same Tully fetche the begynnynge of his fyrste epistle/ in whome he wrytethe to one Lentule on thys maner: I do so my duety in all poyntes to warde you/and so great is the loue and reuerence that I bere vnto you that all other men saye that I can do no more/ and yet me semeth that I haue neuer don that that I am bounde to do/eyther to you or in your cause. We may also get beneuolence by reason of them/whome we make our oracion of: As yf we saye that we can neuer prayse hym to hyghly/but that he is worthy moche more laude and prayse. And so taketh saint Nazazene beneuolence in his sayde oracion for saint Basile. Also of them afore whome we speke/as if we say/it is for theyr profyte to laude or prayse the person. And that we knowe very well howe moche they haue alwayes loued hym/and that he ought therfore to be praysed the more for theyr sakes. The maner is also to get vs beneuolence in the preface of our oracyon/by pynchynge and blamynge of our aduersarie. As doth Tullye in the oracion that he made for one Aulus Cecinna/wherin he begynnethe hys proeme thus. If temerie and lake of shame coulde as moch preuaile in plees afore the iustices/as dothe audacite and temetarious boldenesse in the feldes & deserte places/ there were no remedie but euen so muste Aulus Cecina be ouer come in this matter by Sextus Ebucius impudece/as he was in the felde ouercome by his insidious audacite. And these be the commune formes of beneuolence. A man may also fetche his proheme out of the nature of the place wher he speketh/ as Tullye dothe in the oracyon made for Pompeius for the sendynge of hym into Asie agaynst kynge Mithridates of Pontus/ and kynge Tigraues of Armenie on this maner: howe be it my lordes & maisters of this noble cite of Rome/I haue altymes thought it a synguler reioyse to me if I myght ones se you gadred to gyther in a copany/to here some publique oracion of myne/and agayne I iudged no place to be so ample and so honourable to speke in as thys is. &c. Or he maye begyn at the nature of the tyme that is then/or at some other cyrcustaunce of his mater/as Tully taketh the begynnynge of his oracion for Celius at the tyme/this wyse. If so be it my lordes iudges any man be nowe present here that is ignorat of your lawes/of youre processe in iudgementes & of your customes/surely he may well maruell what so heynous a mater this shulde be/that it onely shulde be syt vppon in an hygh feaste day/whan all the comonaltye after theyr olde custome are gyuen to the sight of playes/ordeined after a perpetual vsage for the nones for them/all maners of the law layd for the tyme vtterly a part. He began also an other oracion for one Sextus Roscius/out of the dauger of the season that he spake in. One may besyde these vse other maner of prohemes/whiche bycause they are nat set out of the very mater it selfe/or els the cercumstaunces/as in these aforsayd they are called peregrine or strauge prohemes. And they be taken out of setences/solepne peticions/maners or customes/lawes/statutes of nacions & contreys. And on thys maner dothe Aristides begyn his oracion made to the prayse of Rome. Demosthenes in his oracyon made agaynste Eschines/toke his preface out of a solempne petycyon/besechynge the goddes that he myght haue as goode fauour in that cause/as he had founde in all other maters that he had done afore for the comon welthe. In lyke maner begynneth Tully the oracion that he made for one Murena/ & also the oracyon that he made vnto the Romaynes after his retourne from exyle. whiche he made as touchynge a lawe decreed for the diuision of feldes amonge the comunes out of a custome amonge them/ on this wyse. The maner and custome of our olde faders of Rome hathe bene. &c. And this is the maner of prefaces in any oracyon/whiche is also obserued in the makinge of epystles/ howe be it there is farre lesse crafte in them than is in an oracyon. There is yet an other fourme & maner to begyn by insinuacion/wherfore it behoueth to knowe that insinuacion is/wha in the begynnyng/if the mater seme nat laudable or honest/we find an excuse therfore. Example/Homere in his Iliade describeth one Thersites/that he was moste foule and euyll fauored of all the Grekes that came to the batayle of Troye/for he was both gogle eyed/and lame on the one legge/with croked and penched shulders/ and a longe pyked hede/balde in very many places. And besyde these fautes he was a great folysshe babler/and ryght foule mouthed/and ful of debate and stryfe/carrynge always agaynste the heddes and wyse men of the armye. Nowe if one wolde take vpon hym to make an oracion to the prayse of his losel/ whiche mater is of litle honesty in it selfe/ he must vse in stede of a preface an insinuacion. That what thynge poetes or commune fame doth eyther prayse or dispraise ought nat to be gyuen credence to/but rather to be suspecte. For ones it is the nature of poetes to fayne and lye/as bothe Homere and Uirgile/which are the princes and heddes of al poetes do witnesse theselfe. Of whome Homere sayth/that poetes make many lies/and Uirgile he sayth The moste part of the sene is but deceyte. Poetes haue sene blake soules vnder the erthe/poetes haue fayned and made many lyes of the pale kyngdome of Plato/and of the water of Stegie/and of dogges in hell. And agayne comune rumours howe often they ben vayne/it is so open that it nede not to be declared. Wherfore his trust is that the hearers wyll more regarde his saynge then fayned fables of poetes/and fleyng tales of lyght fokes/whiche ar for the more parte the grounders of fame and rumours. An example may be set out of the declamacion that Erasmus made to the prayse of folysshenes. An other example hath the same Erasmus in his seconde boke of Copia/whiche is this. Plato in the fyfte dialogue of his communalitie wyllethe that no man shall haue no wyfe of hys owne/but that euery woman shalbe commune to euery man. If any man than wolde eyther prayse or defende this mynde of Plato/which is both contrarie to Christes religion and to the commune lyuynge of men/he myght as Erasmus teacheth/begynne thus. I knowe very well that this matter whiche I haue determyned to speake of/ wyll seme vnto you at the fyrste herynge/ nat onely very straunge/but also right abhominable. But that nat withstandynge/ yf it wyll please you a litle while to deferre your iugemeet tyll ye haue herde the sume of suche reasons as I wyll brynge forthe in the cause/I doubte nothynge but that I shall make the trouthe so euydent that you all wyll with one assent approue it/ & knowlege that ye haue ben hytherto maruelously deceyued in your oppynyon/and somdele to alleuiate your myndes/ye shall vnderstande that I am nat my selfe authour of the thynge/but it is the mynde & saynge of the excellent & moste hyghly named philosopher Plato/whiche was vndoubted so famouse a clerke/so descrete a man/and so vertuouse in al his dedes/that ye may be sure he wold speke nothyng but it were on ryght perfite grounde/and that the thynge were of it selfe very expedient/ thoughe peraduenture it shewe fer otherwyse at the fyrste herynge. In all prefaces or preambules muste be good hede taken that they be not to fer fet nor to longe. These affectuouse wordes/I reioyse/I am sory/I maruayle/I am glad for your sake/I desyre/I fere/I pray god/and suche other lyke be very apte for a preface. The herers shalbe made attente or dylygente to gyue audyence yf the oratour made promyse that he wyll shewe them newe thynges/or els necessary or profytable/or yf he saye that it ys an harde mater that he hathe in handelynge or els obscure and nat easy to be vnderstode excepte they gyue ryght good attedaunce wherfore it is expedient that yf they wyll haue the percepcyon of it that they gyue a good care. But as concernynge the newnes or profyte of the matter it makythe nat all onely the herar to gyue a good eare whiche thinge is callyd attencion but also it makyth him well wyllynge to be presete whiche is beneuolence. Docilite whereby we make the mater playne and easy to be perceyued/ is nat greatly required in this kinde of oracyon/for it is belonginge properly to derke and obscure causes/in whiche we muste promyse that we wyll nat vse great ambages/or to go (as men saye) rounde about the bussh/but to be short and plaine. The Narracion or tale wherin persones are praysed/is the declarynge of theyr lyfe and doynges after the fasshyon of an hystorye. The places out of the whiche it is sought are: The persones byrthe. His chyldhode. His adolescencie. His manes state. His olde age. His dethe and what foloweth after. In his byrthe is consydered of what stocke he came/what chaunsed at the time of his natiuite or nighe vpo/in the natiuite of Christe shepeherdes harde angelles synge. In his chyldhode are marked his bryngynge vp & tokens of wysdome comynge: As Horace in his furthe Satire sheweth/ howe in his childhode his father taught hym by examples of suche as were than lyuynge to flee from vice and to gyue hym selfe to vertue. In adolescence is consydered where to he than gyuethe hym selfe. As in the fyrst comedie of Terence one Simo telleth his seruaunt Sofia/that thoughe all yonge men for the more parte gyue them selfe to some peculiare thynge/wherin they sette theyr cheife delyght/as some to haue goodly horses/some to cherysshe houndes for hunting/ & some are gyuen onely to theyr bokes/his sone Panphilus loued none of these more one tha an other/and yet in all these he exercised hym selfe mesurably. In mannes state and olde age is noted what office or rule he bare among his citisens/ or in his contrey/what actes he dyd/ howe he gouerned suche as were vnder hi howe he prospered/ & what fortune he had in suche thynges as he went about. Exaple here of is in Saluste/whiche copareth together Cato and Cesar/sayeng that bothe theyr stocke/age and eloquence were almoste lyke and egall/theyr excellent and greatnes of spirite and wytte was also lyke and egal/and lyke fame and worshyppe had they bothe attayned howe be it nat by a lyke waye. Ceser was had in great estymacyon for his benefites and liberalyte. Cato had gotten hym a name for his perfyght & vpright lyuynge. Cesar was praysed for his gentilnes and pitie. Cato was honored for his ernestnes and surete. The tother wanne moche bruyt by gyuynge large gyftes/by helpynge suche as were in dystresse and by forgiuyng of trespasses done agaynste hym. Catous fame dyd sprede be cause he wold neither be forgyuen of none offence/neither forgiue non other/but as any man had deserued so to cause him to be delt with. In the one was great refuge to suche as were in mysery: In the other was sore punyshment and pernicion to mysdoers and euyl trangressours of the law. Briefly to coclude it was at Ceazars mynde and pleasure to labour dilygently nyght and daye in his frendes causes/to care lesse for his owne busynes than theyrs/to deny nothynge that was worthy to be asked/his desyre was euermore to be in werre/to haue a great hoost of me vnder his gouernaunce/that by his noble and hardy fayctes his valyantnes myght be the more knowen & spred abrod. Contraryly all Catons study was on teperauce/ and to do in no maner otherwyse than was conuenient & settynge for suche a man as he was/and chiefly he sette his mynde to seueryty he neuer made no comparison with the riche man in richesse/nor with the myghty man in power. But yf nede required/with the hardy ma in boldnes/ with the temperate in moderacyon/ with the good man in innocency & iust dealing. He cared nat for the name/it was suf ficiet to hym to haue the dede/& so/the lesse he cared for glorye/the more alwayes he opteyned. Many suche comparysons very profitable for this intet/are also in Plutarche in his boke of noble mennes lyues. A goodly ensable of this place is in the oracyon that Hermolaus Barbatus made to the emperour Frederike and Maximilian his son/which for bicause it is so long I let it passe. A lyke ensample is in Tullyes oracyon/that he made to the people of Rome for Pompeyus/to be sent agaynste Mythrydates. Some there be that deuide the landes of persons into thre kyndes of goodes begynnynge the narracion at them/whiche thynge our author dothe not greatly commende/ but rather in rehersyng of any persons dedes/yf theyr can nat be kept an order of historie/and many thynges must be spoken. It were after his mynde beste to touche fyrst his actes done by prudence/ & nexte by iustice/thyrdely by fortune of the mynde/and last by temperaunce/and so to gather the narracion out of this foure cardinall vertues. As if one shuld prayse saint Austen/after that he hath spoke of his parentele and bryngynge vp in youth/and is come to the rehersall of his actes/they may be conueniently distributed into the places of vertues. On this maner dyd Tully prayse Pompey. I suppose (sayeth he) that in hym that shulde be a hed capitayne ouer a great army ought to be foure thynges. Knowlege of werre/valiantnes/auctoritie/ & felicitie. Here is to be noted that in rehersynge any persoes actes/we may haue our chief respecte to some peculiare and pryncypall vertue in hym/enlargynge and exaltynge it by amplificacio in maner of a digressio. Our author in this worke maketh no mencyon of the laste place that is deathe and suche thynges as folowe after/but in an other greater worke he declareth it thus briefly. The dethe of the persone hathe also his prayses/as of suche whiche haue ben slayne for the defence of theyr contrey or prynce. A very goodly ensample for the handelynge of this place is in an epistle that An gele Policiane writeth in his fourth boke of epistels to Iames Antiquarie of Laurence Medices/howe wysely and deuoutly he dysposed hym selfe in his dethe bed/ and of his departynge/and what chaunsed at that tyme. And so to conclude an oracion Demonstratiue/ wherein persones are lauded/is an historycall exposycyon of all his lyfe in order. And there is no difference betwene this kynde and an history/saue that in histories we be more briefe and vse lesse curiositie. Here all thynges be augmeted and coloured with as muche ornamentes of eloquence as can be had. Confirmacion of our purpose/and confutynge or reprouynge of the contrarye/ whiche are the partes of contencyon/are nat requysyte in this kynde of oracyon/for here are nat treated any doubteful maters to whom contencyon perteynethe. Neuer the lesse/sotyme it happenethe (howe be it it is seldome)ye a doubte may come/which must be either defeded/or at ye leste excused. The frenche men in olde tyme made myghty warre agaynst ye Romaynes and so sore besyged them that they were by compulcyon constrayned to fal to composycyon with the frenche men for an huge summe of golde/to be payed to them for the breakynge of the syege but beynge in this extreme mysery/they sent for one Camyllus/whome nat very longe afore they had banysshed out of the citie/and in his absence made hym dictatour/whiche was the chyefest dignitie amonge the Romaynes/ and of so great auctoritie/that for the space of thre monethes/for so longe dured the offyce most couenietly/he myght do all thynge at his pleasure/whether it concerned dethe or no/for no man so hardy ones to say nay agaynste any thynge that he dyd/so that for the space he was as a kynge/hauyng al in his owne mere power Nowe it chaunced that while this summe was in payenge/ & nat fully wayed/Camillus of whome I sayd afore/that beyng in exile he was made dictatour/came with an army/and anone bad sease of the payment/ and that eche party shulde make redy to batyle/and so he vainquisshed the frenche men. Nowe yf one shulde prayse hym of his noble faytes/it shulde seme that this was done contrary to the lawe of armes/to defayt the frenche men of the raunsom due to the/syns the compacte was made afore wherefore it is necessary for the oratour to defende this dede/and to proue that he dyd nothyng cotrary to equitie. For ye whiche purpose he hathe two places. One apparent/ whiche is a comon sayenge vsurped of the poete. Dasus an virtus quis in ofte requirat. That is to say/who wyll serche whether the dede of enemy agaynste enemy be eyther gyle or pure valyantnes. But for that in warre lawe is as well to be kept as in other thynges. This sayeng is but of a feble grounde. The other is of a more stroge assuraunce/whiche Titas Liuius writeth in his fyfte boke from the buyldynge of Rome/where he reherceth this hystory nowe myncyoned/and that answere is this that the compacte was made to paye the foresayd raunsome after that Camillus was created dictatour/at what tyme it was nat lawfull that they whiche were of ferre lesse auctoritie/ye and had put them selfe holy in his hande/shulde entermedle them with any maner of treatise without his lycence/and that he was nat bounde to stande to theyr bargayne. The whiche argumente/is deducte out of two circumstaunces/ wherof one is the tyme of the makynge of the compacte/and the other/ the persons that made it/which two cyrcustauees may briefly be called wha/ & who. Lykewyse yf an oracyon shuld be made to the laude of saynt Peter/it behoueth to excuse his denyenge of chryste/that it was rather of diuine power and wyll: tha other wyse/for a confortable exaple to synners of grace yf they repente. This is ye maner of hadelyng of an oracio demostratiue/in which ye perso is praised. The author in his greater worke declareth the fashyon by this example. If one wolde praise kynge Charles/he shulde kepe in his oracyon this order. Fyrst in declarynge his parentel/that he was kynge Pipines sone/whiche was the fyrste of all kynges of Fraunce named the moste chrysten kynge/and by whome all after hym had the same name/and Nephien to Martell/the most valtautest prince that euer was. Nexte/his bryngynge vp vnder one Peter Pysane/of whom he was instructe bothe in Greke and Laten. Than his adolessencie/whiche he passed in excercise of armes vnder his fader in the warres of Acquitaine/where he lerned also the Sarazyues tonge. Beynge come to mannes state/ & nowe kynge of Fraunce/he subdued Aquiatyn/ Italye/Swauelande/and the Saxones. And these warres were so fortunate/that he ouercame his aduersaries more by auctoritie & wysdom tha by effusyon of blode. Also many other notable examples of vertue were in hym in that age/specyally that he edified the vniuersitye of Paris. Here maye by digressyon be declared howe goodly a thyng lernyng is in Prynces. Chiefly suche condicion appertayneth to vertue and and good lyuynge. Here may be also made comparison of his vertues in warre/ & of other agreynge with peace/in the whiche (as his history maketh mencyon) he was more excellent. For his chyefe delyte was to haue peace/& agayne he was so gentyll and so mercyfull that he wolde rather saue euyn suche as had done hym great offence: & had deserued very well for to dye/tha to dystroye them/ thoughe he myght do it conueniently. Besyde this/he was so greatly enflamed in the loue of god and his holy church that one Alcuine a noble clerk of England was continually with hym/in whose prea- chynge and other gostely communicacion he had a chiefe pleasure. His olde age he passed in reste and quyetnes fortunately/ saue for one thyng/that his sonnes agreed euyll betwene them. After his decease reigned his sone/holy saint Lewes/and so the folowinges of his dethe were suche that they colde be no better/ and a very great toke of his good and vertuouse lyuynge.![](/images/inline/ast.gif) For yf an yll tre can bryng furthe no good fruite/what shal we suppose of this noble kynge Charles/of whom cam so vertuouse and so holy a son Truely me thynkethe that hyther may be nat incouenietly applied the sayeges of the gospel/by theyr fruites you shal knowe the. Whan we wyll prayse any maner of dede/the most apte preamble for that pupose shall be to say that the mater proreineth to the comodities of them which here vs. Whan the Romaynes had expelled theyr kynge/who the historicyens cal Tarquine the proude/out of the citie/and fully enacted that they wolde ne- uer haue kynge to reigne more ouer them This Tarquinus wente for ayde and socour to the kynge of Tuscaye/which wha he could by no menes etreat the Romains to receiue agayn theyr kyng/he cam with all his puyssaunce agaynst the citye/and there longe space besieged the Romaynes by reason wherof/great penury of whete was in the citye/and the kynge of Luscay hadde great truste/that continuynge the siege/he shulde within a lytel lenger space compell the Romaynes through famine to yelde them selfe. In the meane season a yonge ma of the citie named Gaius Mucius/came to the Senatours and shewed them that he was purposed yf they wolde gyue hym licence to go furthe of the citye to do an acte that shuld be for theyr great profite and welth/ whereupon when he had obteined licence/ priuely/with weapo hyd vnder his vesture he cam to the Tuscans campe/and gate hym amonge the thyckeste/nyghe to the tent where as the kyng sat with his chauceller/ payenge the sowdiers theyr wages. And bycause that they were almost of lyke apparel/and also the chaunceler spake many thynges as a man beynge in auctorite/ he coulde nat tell whether of them was the kynge/nor he durste nat aske/lest his demaunde wolde haue bewrayed hym/for as for language they had one/ & nothynge was different/for bothe Tuscains and Romayns were all of Italye/as in tymes past/Englande hathe had many kynges/ thoughe the language and peple were one And thus beynge in doubt whether of the he myght steppe vnto/by chauce he strake the chaunceller in stede of the kynge/and slewe hym/wherfore whan he was taken and brought before the kynge/for to punis- she his hande that had fayled in takynge one for an other/and agayne to shewe the kyng howe lytle he cared for his menaces he thrast his hande into the fyre/whiche at that tyme was there prepared for sacrifyce/ and there in the flame let it brenne/ nat ones mouynge it. The kynge greatly merueylynge at his audacitie and hardy nature commended hym greatly thereof/ and had hym go his way free. For the which (as though he wolde make the kynge a great amendes) he fayned that .iii. C. of the noblest yonge me of Rome had conspyred to gyther in lyke maner euery one after another vnwares to slee hym/and all to put theyr bodyes and lyues in hasarde tyll tyme shulde chaunce that one myght acheue theyr entent. Forfere whereof the kynge furthwith fel at a pointement with the Romaines/and departed. The yonge man after warde was named Sceuola/ whiche is as muche to say in Englyssh as lefte haded. For as I haue rehersed afore/ he brente his ryght hande/so that he had loste the vse therof. If any oratour wolde in an oracyon commende this dede/he myght conueniently make the preface on this fashyon. There is no doubte my lordes and maysters of Rome: but that the remembraunce of Sceuolas name is very pleasant vnto your audience/whiche with one acte that he dyd/endewed your citie with many & greate comodyties .&c. This maner of preface is moste conuenyent and best annexyd to suche maner of oracyons demonstratyues. Neuer the lesse it is lawfull for vs to take our preface (yf it be our pleasure) oute of some circumstaunce/as out of the place that our oracion is made in/or out of the tyme that we spake in/or els otherwyse accordynge as we shall haue occasyon/As Tullye/in the oracyon that he made for the restitucyou of Marcus Marcellus/in the whiche he prayseth Cezare for the callynge home of the sayd Marcus mercellus out of exyle/he taketh his preamble out of the tyme & Cezares perso/begynnyug thus. This daye my lordes Senatoures hathe made an ende of the longe scilence that I haue kepte a great whyle/nat for any fere that I had/but part for great sorowe that was in me/and partly for shame/ this daye as I sayd hathe take away that longe scilence/ye/and besyde that of newe brought to me luste and mynde to speke what I wolde/and what I thought moste expediet/lyke as I was afore wont to do. For I can nat in no manner of wyse refrayne/but I muste nedes speke of the great mekenes of Cezare/of the graciousnes that is in hym/so habundant and so great withall/that neuer afore any suche hathe ben wont to be sene or harde of/and also of the excellent good moderacyon of all thynges whiche is in hym that hathe all in his owne mere power. For I can nat let passe his excellent incredible/and diuine wysdome vnspoken of afore you at thys tyme. In this kynde we vse but selden hole narracions/oneles we make our oracion afore them that knowe nat the history of the acte or dede whiche we be aboute to praise. But in stede or a narracio we vse a proposycion/on this maner. Amonge all the noble dedes Cesar that you haue done there is non that is more worthy to be praysed then this restitusion of Marke Marcell. The places of confyrmacyon are honesty/ perfite/lyghtnes/or hardines of dede. For after the proheme of the oracion and the narracyon/then go we to the prouynge of our mater. Fyrst shewing that it was a very honeste dede. And next/ that it was nat all onely honesty: but also profitable. Thyrdely as concernynge the easines or difficulti/the praise therof muste be consydered/part in the doer/part in the dede. An easy dede deserueth no great pray- se/but an harde & a ieoperdouse thyng/the soner and the lyghtlyter it is acheued/the more it is to be lauded. The honesty of the cause is set from the nature of the thynge that is spoken of/whiche place lieth in the wytte of the oratour/and maye also be set out of the phylosophers bokes. It is also copiosely declared of Rhetorycyens/and very compendiously handled of Exasmus in his boke/entituled of the maner & crafte to make epistles/in the chapitre of a persuadynge epistle. The profyte of the dede/ or the commoditie may be set at the circustaunce of it. Circustauces are these what was done/who dyd it/whan/where it was done/amonge whom/by whose helpe. As if one wolde praise Sceuolaes acte/ of ye which mencio was made afore he may Whan he cometh to the places of contencion/ shewe fyrste howe honest a dede it is for any man to put his lyfe in ieoperdy for the defence of his contrey/whiche is so muche the more to be commended that it came of his owne mynde/and nat by the instigacion of any other/and howe profitable it was to the citie to remoue so stronge and puyssaunt an enemy by so good and crafty policy/what tyme the citie was nat wel assured of all menes myndes that were within the walles/cosideryng that but a lytle afore many noble yonge men were detecte of treason in the same busines. And Then also the citie was almoste destitute of vitailes/and all other commodities necessary for the defence. Lyke wyse easynes or difficultie are con- teyned in the circumstaunces of the cause. As in the example nowe spoke of/what an harde enterprise it is for one man to entre in to a kynges armye/and to come to the kynges pauilio in the face of his souldiers to aduenture to slee hym. Confutacion is the foilynge of suche argumentes as maye be induced agaynste our purpose/whiche parte is but lytle vsed in an oracion demonstratiue. Neuer the lesse/sotyme may chauce a thynge that muste be eyther defended or els at the leste excused. As if any ma wolde speke of Camillus dede/wherby he recoue- red his cotrey/ & delyuered it fro the handes of the Frenche me. Here must be declared that the bargayne made afore was nat by Camillus violate. The coclusion is made of brife enu- meracion of suche thynges that we haue spoken of afore in the oracyon and in mouynge of affections. that haue bene well done/we moue our audyence to reioce there at/and to do lyke. In sad thynges and heuy/to be sory for them. In yll and peruerse actes/to beware that they folowe nat them to theyr great shame and confusyon. Of an oracion demonstratyue/wherin are praised neither persones nor actes/ but some other thynge/as religion/ matrimony/or suche other. The beste begynnynge wyl be if it be taken out of some hygh prayse of the thynge. But a man maye also begyne otherwyse/eyther at his owne per- son or at theyrs afore whom he speketh/or at the place in the whiche he speketh/or at the season present/or otherwyse/as hathe afore ben specified/and here must we take good hede that yf we take vpo vs to praise any thynge that is no praise worthy/than muste we vse insinuacyon/and excuse the turpitude/either by examples or by argumentes/ as Erasmus dothe in his epistle prefixed afore his oracyo made to the pray- se of folysshnes/of the whiche I haue let passe the translacyon because the epistle is somewhat longe. In this maner of oracyon is no narracyon/ but in stede therof the Rhetoricyens al only propose the mater. And this proposio is in ye stede of the narracyo A very elegae example is in the oracion that Angele Politiane made to the laude of histories/whiche is this. Amonge all maner of wryters by whome either the Greke tounge or the latine hathe bene in floure and excellence/without doubte me semeth that they dyd most profyte to makynde/ by whom the excellent dedes of nacyons/ prynces/or valyant men haue bene truely descryued and put in cronicles. Lykewyse yf a man prayse peace/and shewe what a commodiouse thynge it is he maye make suche a proposyeyon. Amonge all the thynges whiche perteine to manes commoditie/of what someuer condycyon or nature so euer they be/non is so excellent and so worthy to be had in honour and loue/as is peace. The places of confyrmacyon be in this oracyon. The same that were in the other (of whom mencion was made afore/honesty/profyte/easynes/or difficulty. Honesty is consydered in the nature of the thynge/also in the persones that haue excercysed it/and the inuenters therof. And in the auctour of it. As in the laude of matrymony be consydered the auctour thereof/whiche was god hym selfe/ the antiquite that it was made in the fyrst begynnynge of the world/ & cotinued (as reaso is) to this hour in great honour and reuerece. The persones that haue vsed it/were bothe patriarches/as Abraham. Prophetes/as Dauyd. Apostels/as saynt Peter. Martyrs/saynt Eustache. And cofessours/ as saynt Edwarde. And (whiche thynge was fyrste proposed) the nature therof is suche/that without it: man shuld be lyke vnto beste/oneles all generacyon shulde be put aparte. And the commaudement of almighty god nat regarded/who bad ma & woma shuld engeder & multiply. Profite and easines is considered in the circumstaunces. Examples may be taken out of Polycyans oracyons/made to the laude of hystoryes. And two oracyons of Erasmus/one to the laude of physike/and an other to the laude of matrymony. Confutacyon hathe contrary places to confyrmacyon. The periode or conclusyon standethe in the bryefe enumeracyon of thingses spoken afore/and in mouynge the affectyons/ as hathe bene aboue expressed. An oracio deliberatiue is by the whiche we parsuade or dissuade any thig/ and by the which we aske/or where- by we exorte any man to do a thynge/or els to forsake it/and this kynde of oracion is muche in vse/nat onely in ciuile maters: but also in epistles. We may begynne our oracion in this kynde/euyn lyke as we dyd in an oracyon demonstratyue/but moste aptly at our offyce or duety/leste some men wolde thynke that we dyd it more of a priuate affectio for our owne comodite & plesure: than for any other mannes profyte. And in this maner Salust in his boke of Cathelyne bryngeth in Cezare/begynnynge an oracyon. But let vs here nowe what Cezar sayeth. All men my lordes Senatours whiche syt coucellyng vpon any doubtfull maner/muste be voyde of hatred/fredshype/ anger/pitye/or mercye. For where any of these thynges bere a rule/mannes minde ca nat lightely parceiue the truthe. &c. Or els we may begyn at the gretenes of the mater/or dauger of the thyng that we speke of/as in the fyste boke of Liuius. Camillus maketh the preable of his oracio thus My maysters of this Citie of Ardea/ whiche haue ben alwayes myne old frendes/ & nowe (by reason of myne exyle out of Rome) my newe neyghbours and citizens. For I thanke you of your goodnes you haue promysed that it shulde so be/& on the other syde my fortune hathe constrayned me to seke some newe dwellyng out of the citie where I was brought vp and enhabyted. I wolde nat that any of you shulde thynke that I am nowe come amonge you nat remembrynge my codicyon and state/but the comon ieopardy that we be all nowe in/wyll compell euery man to open and shewe the beste remedy that he knowethe for our socoure in this great fere and necessyty. Nat withstandynge this/a man maye take his begynnynge otherwyse/after any of the facyons afore recyted/if he lyste. Tully in the oracion/wherin he aduised the Romaynes to make Pompey theyr chyefe capytayne againste Mythrydates and Tygranes/kynges of Ponthus and Armeny/taketh in the preface beneuolece from his owne person/shewynge by what occacyon he myght laufully gyue coucell to the Romaynes/bycause he was electe Pretor of the citie. We may also touche our aduersaryes in the preface/or els we may touche the maners/either of some seuerall persons/or of the commons in general. As in the oracyon that Porcyus Cato made agaynste the sumptuousnes of the women of Rome/thus. If euery man my lordes and maisters of this citie wolde obserue and kepe the ryght and maiesty of a man agaynste his owne wyfe/we shulde haue ferre lesse encombrance nowe with the hole thronge than we haue. But nowe our fredome & ly- bertie is ouercome within our owne dores by the importunatnes of our wyues/and so audicitie take therof here troden vnder the fete/and oppressed in the parlyament house. And by cause we wold nat displease no man his owne wyfe at home: here are we nowe combred with all/gathered to- gyder on a hepe/& brought in that takinge that we dare nat ones open our lyppes agaynste them &c. We may also begyn at the nature of the tyme that we speke in/or at the nature of the place/or at any other circumstaunce or thynge incident. As Liuius in the .ix. boke of his fourthe decade agaynste the feastes that the Romaynes kept in the honour of the ydolyshe god Bacchus/begynneth his oracyon at prayenge on this wyst. The solempne makynge of prayers vnto the goddes was neuer so apte nor yet so necessary in any oracyon as it is in this/whiche shall shewe and admonyshe you that they be very & right goddes/ whom our elders haue ordeyned to be worshypped/aboured/and prayed vnto. Bryefly in all prefaces belongynge to oracyons delyberatyues the offyce of the perso: & the necessytye or comodytye of the matter that we treate of are consydered. In oracyons dylyberatyues we vse very seldome narracyons/but for the more parte in stede of the we make a bryef proposyo conteyuynge the summe of our entent. As nowe adayes nothynge is so necessary as to labour to brynge these diffencyons that be in the churche to a perfecte vnite and concorde/that accordynge to Christes sayenges/there be but one shepeherde and one folde. Neuertheles we vse sometyme briefe narracyons/whan that some thynge hathe bene done all redy of that that we gyue our councel vpon/as in the aboue sayd oracio that Tuly made for Popey/where he maketh this narracyon. Great & very perillous warre is made bothe agaynste your tributours/and also them that bothe cofederate with you/ and by you called your felowes/whiche warre is moued by two ryght myghty kynges/Mythrydates and Tigranes. &c. After this maner is a narracyon in the oracion that Haniball made to Scipio/ & is conteined in the .x. boke of the .iii. decade of Liuius/ryght proper and elegant with out any proface beginning his narracio thus' If it hathe ben ordeined by my fortune and desteny that I whiche fyrste of all the Carthaginois began warre with the Romayns/ and whiche haue almoste had the victory so often in myne hades/shuld now come of myne owne mynde to aske peace. I am glad that fortune hathe prepared that I shulde aske it of you specially. And amonge all your noble lades this shall nat be one of the leste that Hanibal gaue ouer to you/to whom the goddes had gyuen afore the vyctorye ouer so many capitains of the Romaynes/and than it was your lucke to make an ende of this warre/in the whiche the Romayns haue had ferre mo euyl chauces then we of Carthagene. And whether it were my destene or chauce that ought me this skornefull shame. I whiche began the warre whan your father was Cofull and after ioyned batayle with him whan he was made Capitayne of the Romayns army/muste nowe come vnarmed to his son to aske peace of hym. It had ben beste for bothe parties if it had pleased the goddes to haue sent our fore faders that mynde/that you of Rome wolde haue ben content with the Empyre of Italy/ & we Caraginoys with Affryke. For neyther Sisil nor Sardynya can be any suffycient amedes to eyther of vs for so many naueis so many armies/so many and so excellent capitaines loste in our warres betwene vs but thynges passed/may soner be blamed tha meded. We of Cartagene (as touching our parte) haue so coueted other domintos that at lengthe we had busines ynough to defende our possessions. Nor the warre hathe nat bene only with you in Italy or with vs onely in Affryke: but at the pleasure of fortune sometyme here and some there/in so muche that you my maisters of Rome haue sene the staderdes and armes of your enemyes harde at your walles and gates of the citie. And we on the other syde haue herde the noyse out of your campe into our citie. After the narracyon ought to folowe immadiately the proposycyon of our councell or aduise. As after the narracio of Haniball afore reherced/foloweth the proposycyon of his purpose thus. That thynge is nowe entreated while fortune is fauourable vnto you/ & we ought moste to abhorre/and you surely ought aboue all thynges to desyre/ that is to haue peace. And it is moste for the profyte of vs two/whiche haue the mater in handelynge that peace be had. And sure we be/that what so euer we agre vpo our cities wyll ratyfye the same. Nexte foloweth the cofirmacion of tho thynges that we etende to persuade/whiche must be set out of the places of honisty profyte/easynes/of difficulty. As if we wyll persuade any thynge to be done/we shall shewe that it is nat onely honest and laudable: but all so profytable and easy ynough to perfourme. Or if we can nat chose but graunte that it is harde/yet we shall shew that it is so honest a dede/so worthy prayse and besydes so great comodity wyll come therof/that the hardenes ought in no wyse to fere vs: but rather be as an instigacyon to take the thynge on hande/remebrynge the greke prouerbe. Scisnola ta nala/ that is to say/all excellent and commendable thynges be harde and of dyffyculty. In honesty are copreheded all vertues/ as wysdome/iustice/due loue to god/and to our parentes/lyberality/pyty/ constace/ temperance. And therfore he that wyll for the confyrming of his purpose declare and proue that it is honeste and commendable that he etendeth to parsuade hym: behoueth to haue perfyte knowlege of the natures of vertues And all so to haue in redy remebraunce sentences bothe of scripture and of philosophy/as oratours and poetes/and besyde these/examples of historyes for gar nysshynge of his maters. As concernynge the place of vtilite/we must in all causes loke if we may haue any argumentes wherby we may proue that our councell is of suche necessity/that it can nat be chosen but they must nedes folowe it for the argumetes be of ferre greater strengthe than they that do but onely proue the vtilite of the mater. But if we can haue no suche necessary reasons/than we muste serche out argumentes to proue our mynde to be profytable by circustaces of the cause. In lyke maner to persuade a thynge by the easines therof/or dissuade to by the difficulty of the thynge/we muste haue respect to possibiliti or impossibilitie/ for these proues are of strenger nature tha the other/and he that wyll shewe that a thynge may be done easely: must presuppose the possibilete therof. As he on the other syde that wyll persuade a thynge nat to be done/yf he shewe and manyfeste that it is impossible/argueth more strongely than if he could but only proue difficulty in it. For as I sayd afore many thynges of difficulty yet may be the rather to be taken in hade/ that they may get them that acheue them the greater fame and prayse. And these argumentes be set out of the circumstances of the cause/that is to saye/the tyme/the place/the doers/the thyng it selfe/the meanes whereby it shulde be done/the causes wherefore it shulde be done or nat/the helpes or impedimentes that may be therin. In this purpose examples of histories are of greate effycacy. The confutacyon is the soylynge and refellynge of other mennes sayenges that haue or myght be brought agaynste our purpose/wherefore it consysteth in places contrary to the places of confyrmacyon/ as in prouynge the sayenge of the contrary part neyther to be honeste nor profytable/ nor easy to perfourme/or els vtterly impossyble. The coclusyon standeth in two thinges/that is to saye (a bryefe and compendiouse repetynge of all our reasons that we haue brought for vs afore/and in mouyng of affectyons. And so dothe Ulysses conclude his oracyon in the .xiii. boke of Ouide Metamorphosy. Oracyons iudiciall be that longe to controuersies in the lawe and plees/whiche kynde of oracion in olde tyme longed onely to Iudges and men of lawe/but nowe for the more parte it is neglecte of them/though there be nothynge more necessarye to quicke the in crafty & wyse hadeling of theyr maters. In these oracions the fyrste is to fynde out the state of the cause/whiche is a short preposicion/conteynynge the hole effect of all the controuersies. As in the oracion of Tully/made for Mylo/of the whiche I made mencyon in the begynnynge of my boke. The state of the cause is this. Mylo slewe Clodius lawfully/whyche thynge his aduersaries denyed/and yf Tully can proue it/the plee is wonne. Here must be borne away that there be thre maner of states in suche oracyons. The fyrste is called contecturall. The seconde legitime. The thyrde/iudiciall/ and euery of these hathe his owne proper places to set out argumentes of the wherfore they shall be spoken of seuerally. And fyrste we wyll treate of state contecturall/ whiche is vsed whan we be certayne that the dede is done/but we be ignorant who dyd it/and yet by certayne coniectures we haue one suspecie/that of very lykelyhode it shulde be he that hathe commytted the cryme. And therfore this state is called coiecturall/bycause we haue to manyfeste profe/but all onely great lykelyhodes/or as the Rhetoriciens call the coniectures. There was a great contencion in the Grekes army afore Troye betwene Ulisses and Aiax/after the dethe of Achelles/whiche of them shulde haue his armour as nexte to the sayd Achilles in valiauntnes. In whiche cotrouersye wha the Grekes hadde Iudged the sayde armour vnto Ulisses/Aiax for very great disdayne fel out of his mynde/and shortly after in a wode nygh to the hoste/after he had knowen (whan he cam agayne to him selfe) what folysshe prankes he had played in the tyme of his phrenesy/for sorow and shame he slewe hym selfe. Sone vpon this dede cam Ulisses by/whiche seynge Aiax thrust thrughe with a swerde: cam to hym and as he was about to pul out the swerd/ the frendes of Aiax chaunced to come the same way/which seyng theyr frede deade/ and his olde enemy pullynge out a swerde of his body/they accused hym of murder. In very dede here was no profe. For of truthe Ulisses was nat gylty in the cause. Neuer theles the enuye that was betwene Aiax and hym: made the mater to be nat a lytlye suspecte/specyally for that he was foude there with the sayd Aiax alone wherefore the state of the plee was coiectural/ whether Ulisses slewe Aiax or nat. The preface is here euyn as it is in other oracions. For we begyn accordynge to ye nature of ye cause that we haue on hande/either in blamyng our aduersarye/ or els mouyng the herers to haue pity on our client. Or els we begyn at our owne parson/or at the praise of the Iuge. &c. The narracio or tale is the shewynge of the dede in maner of an historye/ wherin the accuser muste craftly entermegle many suspicyons whiche shall seme to make his mater prouable. As Tulli in his oracion for Milo/where in his narracyon he intendeth by certayne coniectures to shewe that Clodius laye in wayte for Milo/ he in his sayde narracyon handelethe that place thus. In the meane season wha Clodius had knowledge that Milo had a lawfull and necessary iourney to the city Lauine the. xiii. day afore the kalendes of Marche/to poynte who shuld be hed preste there/whiche thyng longed to Milo because he was dictatour of that towne: Clodius sodaynely the day afore departed out of Rome to set vpon Milo in a lordeshyp of his owne/as after was wel parceyued. And suche haste he made to be goynge that where as the people were gadered the same day for maters wherin also he had greate ado hymselfe/ & very necessary it had bene for hym to haue bene there/yet this nat withstandyng/al other thynges aparte: he wet his way/which you may be sure he wold neuer haue done/ saue onely that he had fully determined to preuent a tyme and place conuenient for his malicius entet afore Miloes comyng. In this pece of Tullies narracyon are entermengled fyrste that Clodius knewe of Miloes goynge/whiche makethe the mater suspecte that Clodius went afore to mete with him/for this was wel knowe afore that Clodius bare Milo great gruge & malyce. Next is shewed the place where as Clodius mete Milo/which also giueth a great suspicion/for it was nygh Clodius place/where he myght sone take socour/& the tother was in leste assurauice. Thyrdly that he departed out of the city/what time it had bene moste expedient/ye and also greatly requisite for hym to haue bene at home. And that agayne maketh the mater suspect/for surely he wolde nat (as Tully hym selfe sayeth) in no wyse haue bene absent at suche a busy tyme/onles it had bene for some great purpose/ & what other shulde it seme than to slee Milo. As surely euedet it was that they buckled to gyther/ and this was well knowen that Milo had a necessary cause to go furth of Rome at that tyme. Contraryly in Clodius coulde be perceyued none other occasyo to depart than out of the citie: but of lykelyhood to lye in wayte for Milo. Out of the narracion must be gaderyd abryfe sentence/wherein shall stande the hole pithe of the cause/for Rhetoricies put incotinent after the narracyon diuisyon/ whiche is a part of contencyon/and dothe bryefly shewe wherin the cotrouersy dothe stande/or what thynges shalbe spoke of in the oracion. This diuision is deuyded into seiunction and distribucion. Setunction is whan we shewe wherin our aduersaries and we agre/and what it is/wherupon we stryue. As they that pledyd Clodius cause agaynste Milo/myght on this maner haue vsed setunction. That Milo slewe Clodius: our aduersaries can nat denayeis but whether he myght so do lawfully or nat/is our controuersy. Distribucion is the proposicion wherein we declare of what thynges we wyll speke/of whiche yf we propose howe many they be/ it is called enumeracion/but yf we do nat expresse the nombre/it is called exposicion. Example of bothe is had in the oracion that Tully made to the people that Pompeyus myght be made chyefe capytayne of the warres agaynste Mithridates and Tigranes/where after the preface and narracyon he maketh his proposycyon by exposycyon thus. Fyrste I thynke it expedyent to speke of the nature & kynde of this warre/ and after that of the greatnes thereof/and then to shewe howe an hede or chyefe capytayne of any army shulde be chosen. whiche laste membre of his exposycyon he agayne distributeth into foure partes thus as foloweth. Truley this is myne opynyon/that he whiche shall be a gouerner of an hoost/ought to haue these foure propertyes in hym. The fyrste is/that he haue perfyte knowlege of all suche thynges as lengeth to warre. The seconde is that he be a man of his handes. The thyrde that he be a ma of suche auctority: that his dignity maye cause his souldiers to haue hym in reuerence & awe. The fourth is that he be fortunate & lucky in al thinges that he goeth about. Tully in the oracto for Milo proposeth all onely shewynge wherein the cotrouersy of the plee dyd stande on thys maner. Is there than any thynge els that muste be tryed & iudged in this cause saue this: whether of them bothe beganne the fraye & entended to murder the tother: No surely. So that yf it can be founden that Milo went about to distroye Clodius/: than he be punysshed therfore accordyngly. But yf it can be proued that Clodius was the begynuer and layed wayte for to slee Milo/and so was the sercher of his owne dethe/& that what Milo dyd it was but to defende hym selfe fro the treaso of his enyme & the sauegarde of his lyfe: that than he may be delyuered and quyte. The confyrmacyon of the accuser is fetched out of these places/wyl/and power. For these two thynges wyll cause the perso that is accused to be great ly suspect that he had wyl to do the thyng that he is accused of/and that he myght wyll ynoughe brynge it to passe. To proue that he had wyll therto: you must go to .ii. places. The one is the qualite of the persone/and the other is the cause that meuyd hym to the dede. The qualite of the person is thus handled. For to loke what is his name or surname/and if it be noughty to saye that he had it nat for nothyng: but that nature had such pryue power in men to make them gyue names accordynge to the maners of euery person. Than next to behold his contrey. So Tul ly in his oracion made for Lucius Flaccus to improue the wytnes that was brought agaynste hym by Grekes/layth vnto the the lyghtnes of theyr cotrey. This (sayeth Tully) do I saye of the hole nacion of Grekes. I graunte to them that they haue good lernynge/and the knowlege of many scyences. Nor I denye nat but that they haue a pleasat and marueylouse swete speche. They are also people of hygh and excellent quycke wytte and thereto they be very facundiouse. These and suche other qualities wherin they booste them selfe greatly: I wyll nat repyne agaynst it that they bere the maystry therin. But as concernynge equitie and good conscience/requisite/ in berynge of recorde/or gyuynge of any wytnes/ & also as touchynge faythfulnes of worde and promyse: truely this nacion neuer obserued this property neyther they knewe nat what is the strength/ auctoritye/and weyght therof. So to Englysshmen is attributed suptuousnes in meates and drynkes. To Frechemen/ pryde/ & delyte in newe fantasyes To Flemmynges and Almaynes/great drynkynge/and yet inuentyfe wyttes. To Brytayns/Gascoignes/and Polones/latyne. To Spanyerdes/agilitye. To ytalyens/ hygh wyt and muche subtylty. To Scottes/boldnes/to Irissh men/hastines To Boemes valiauntnes and tenacite of opynions.&c. After that to loke on his kynred/as yf his father or mother or other kynne were of yll disposicion/for as the tre is: suche fruite it berethe. On this wyse dothe Phillis entwyte Demophon/that his father Theseus vncurteysly and trayterously lefte his loue Ariadna alone in the desert yle of Naxus/ and contrary to his promyse stale from her by nyght/addynge. Heredem patria perfide fraudis agis. That is to saye/vntrewe & false forsworne man/thou playest kyndely thy fathers heyre/in deceytable begylynge of thy true louer. After that we muste loke vpon the sex/ whether it be man or woman that we accuse/ to se yf any argument can be deducte out of it to our purpose. As in men is noted audacite/women be comonly tymerouse. Than nexte/the age of the persone. As in Therence Simo speketh of his son Pamphilus/ sayeth vnto his man called Sosia/ howe couldest thou knowe his condicions or nature afore/whyle his age and feare/ and his maystrer dyd let it to be knowen. Hipermestra in Ouides epistels ioyneth these.ii. places of sexe & age togyther thus I am a woman and a yonge mayden/ mylde and gentyll/bothe by nature and yeres. My softe handes are nat apte to fyers batayles. After these folowe strength of body/or agylite/and quicknes of wyt/out of whiche may be brought many reasons to affyrme our purpose. So Tully in his oracyon for Milo/wyllynge to proue that Clodius was the begynner of the fraye/ sheweth that Milo (which was neuer wot but to haue men about hym) by chaunce at that tyme had in his company certayne Musiciens and maydens that wayted on his wyse/whom he had syttyng with hym in his wagen. Contraryly Clodius that was neuer wont afore but to ryde in a wagen & to haue his wyfe with hym: at that tyme rode furth on horsebacke. And where as afore he was alwayes accustomed to haue knaues and quenes in his company: he had the non but tal me with hym/ & (as who shulde say) men piked out for ye nones. To this is added forme/as to assay yf we can haue any argument to our purpose out of the persones face or countenance/ and so dothe Tully argue in his oracyon agaynste Pyso/sayenge on thys wyse. Leste thou nat nowe thou beste: doste thou nat nowe perceyue what is mennes coplaynt on thy uysage: there is non that complayneth that I wote nat what Surryen & of theyr flocke whiche be but newly crepte vp to honour out of the donghyll is nowe made consull of the citie. For this seruile colour hathe nat deceiued vs nor hery cheke balles/nor rotten and fylthy tethe/thyne yes/thy browes/forhed/and hole coutenaunce/which in a maner dothe manifest mennes condicyons and nature/ it hath diceued vs. This done/we must consyder howe he hathe bene brought vp that we accuse/amonge whom he hathe lyued/and whereby/howe he gouernethe his houshold/ & assay if we can pyke out of these ought for our purpose. Also of what state he is of/fre or bond/ryche or pore/berynge offyce or nat/a man of good name/ or otherwise/wherin he deliteth most/whiche places do expresse manes lyuyng/and by his lyuynge: his wyll and mynde/as I wolde declare more fully/save that in introductions men muste labour to be short/ & agayne they are suche that he that hath any perceyuynge may sone knowe what shall make for his purpose/and howe to set it furthe. And therfore this shall suffyse as touchynge the qualitie of the person. If we bere away this for a general rule (that what maketh for the accuser euermore the contrary) is sure staye for the defender/ yf he can proue it/or make it of the morelykelphode. As Tully in defendynge Milo/layeth to Clodius frendes charges that he had none about hym but chose me. And for to clere Milo he sheweth the contrary/ that he had with hym syngyng laddes and women seruantes that wayted on his wyfe. whiche maketh it of more likelyhod that Clodius wente about to slee Milo than Milo hym. The cause that moueth to the myschefe lyeth in two thinges. In naturall impulsyon/ and raciocinacion. Naturall impulsion is angre/hatred/co uetyse loue/or suche other affections. So Simo in Therence/whan he had sayd that Dauus (who he had poynted to wayt vpon his sonne Pamphilus)wolde do all that myght lye in hym bothe with hande and fote/rather to dysplease hym:then to please Pamphilus mynde. And Sofia demaunded why he wolde do so. Simo made aunswere by ractocinacion/sayenge doste thou aske that: mary his vngracious and vnhappy mynd is the cause therof. Oenon in Ouides epistles ioyneth togyther qualytie and naturall impulsyon/sayenge. A Tuuene et Cupido credatur reddita virgo: whiche is in Englysshe. Thynke you that she that was caried awaye of a yonge ma/and hote in loue/was restored agayne a mayde: Tully in the oracion for Milo/amonge other argumetes bryngeth in one against Clodius by naturall impulsion of hatred/ shewynge that Clodius had cause to hate Milo fyrst/for he was one of them that la boured for the same Tullyes reuocacyon from exyle/whiche Tulli Clodius maliciously hated. Agayne that Milo oppressyd many of his furiouse purposes. And fynally bycause the sayd Milo accused hym and caste hym afore the Senate and people of Rome. Raciocinacio is that cometh of hope of any commodity/or to eschewe any discom modity. As Tully argueth in his oracion for Milo agaynst Clodius by raciocinacion to proue that it was he that laide wayt for Milo on this maner. It is sufficient to proue that this cruel and wicked beste had a great cause to flee Milo/yf he wolde brynge his maters that he wet aboute to passe/and great hope if he were ones gone/nat to be letted in his pretenced malyce. After raciocinacion foloweth comprobacion/ to shewe that no man els had any cause to go there about/saue he whome we accause/nor no profyte coulde come to no man thereof: saue to hym. These are the wayes whereby an oratour shal proue that the parsone accused had wyl to the thynge ye is layde to his charge To proue that he might do it: ye must go to the circumstance of the cause/ as that he had lyeser ynough there to and place conuenient and strength withall. Also you shall proue it by sygnes/which are of merueylouse efficacye in this behalfe/ wherfore here muste be noted that sygnes be eyther wordes or dedes that eyther dyd go before or els folowe the dede. As Tully in his oracion nowe often alledged argueth agaynst Llodius by sygnes goyng afore the dede/as that Clodius sayd thre dayes afore Milo was slayne: he ye shulde lyue thre dayes to an ende. And that he went out of the city a lytle afore Milo rode furthe with agreate company of stronge and myscheuous knaves. Signes follwynge are as yf after the dede was done he fled or els whan it was layed to his charge: he blusshed or waxed pale/or stutted and coulde nat well speke. The contrary places( as I sayd afore) long to the defender/saue that in signes he must vse .ii. thinges/absolucio & inuencio. Absolucyon is wherby the defendour sheweth that it is laufull for hym to do that what the aduersary bryngeth in for a signe of his malyce. A Man is founde coueryng of a dede body/and therupon accused of murder/ he may answere that it is laufull to do so for the preseruacyon of his body fro rauons and other that wold deuoure hym/ tyll tyme he had warned people to fetche & bury hym. Inuercion it wherby we shewe that the signe whiche is brought agaynste: vs maketh for vs. As I wolde nat haue taryed to couer hym yf I had done the dede my selfe: but haue fled and shronke asyde into some other way for feare of takynge. The coclusto is as I haue sayd afore briefe repetynge of the effecte of our reasons/ & in mouynge the Iudges to our purpose. The accuser to punysshe the parson accused. The defeder/to moue him to pity. Of the state iuridictall/and the handelynge therof. As state coniecturall cometh out of this questyon (who dyd the dede) so whan there is no dout but that the dede is done/and who dyd it/many tymes controuersy is had/whether it hathe bene done laufully or nat. And this state is negociall or iuridiciall/whiche conteyneth the ryght or wronge of the dede. As in the oracion of Tully for Milo/the state is iuridiciall/ for ope it was that Clodius was slayn/and that Milo slewe hym/but whether he kylled hym laufully or nat: is the cotrouersy & state of the cause/as I haue afore declared. The confirmacion hath certayn places appropred thereto/but here muste be marked that state negocyall is double/absolute/and assumptyue. State negociall absolute is whan the thynge that is in controuersy is absolutely defended to be laufully done. As in the oracio of Tulli for Milo/the dede is styfly affirmed to be laufully done in sleyng Clodius/ seynge that Milo dyd it in his owne defence/for the lawe permitted to repell violence violently. The places of confirmacyon in state absolute are these/nature/lawe/custome/equity or reason/iugemet/necessity/bargayne or couenat. Of the whiche places Tully in his oracio for Milo brigeth in the more parte to gyther in a cluster on this maner. If reason hath prescrybed this to lerned and wyse me/and necessity hathe dryuen it into barbours and rude folke/ & custome kepeth it among all nacions/and nature hathe planted it in bruyte bestes/ that euery creature shulde defede hym selfe and saue his lyfe and his body from all violence by any maner of socour/what meanes or way so euer it were. You ca nat iuge this dede euyll done/except you will iudge that whan men mete with theuys or murderers/ they muste eyther be slayne by the wepons of suche vnthryfty and malycious persones: eyther els perysshe by your sentence gyuen in iudgement vpon them. State assumptyue is whan the defence is feble of it selfe/but yet it may be holpen by some other thynge added to it. And the places longynge to this state are grauntynge of the faute/remouyng of the faute/ or (as we say in our tonge) layeng it from vs to an other/ & traslatynge of the faute. Grautyng of the faute is whan the person accused denieth nat the dede/but yet he desyreth to be forgyuen/ & it hath .ii. places mo annexyd to it/purgacion & deprecacio. Purgacion is whan he sayeth he dyd it nat maliciously: but by ignorace or mishap whiche place Cato vseth ironiously in Salust/ thus. My mynde is that ye haue pity with you/for they that haue done amysse be but very yonge men/ & desyre of honour draue them to it. Deprecacio is wha we haue non excuse: but we call vpon the Iustices mercy. The handelynge wherof Tully wryteth in his boke of inuencion thus. He that laboreth to be forgyue of his faut/must reherce (yf he can) some be nefytes of his/done afore tyme/and shewe that they be farre greater in theyr nature than is the cryme that he hathe commytted/so that (howe be it he hath done greatly amysse) yet the goodes of his fore merites are farre bygger/and so may wel oppresse this one faut. Nexte after that it behoueth hym to haue refuge to the merytes of his elders/yf there be any/and to open them. That done/he must retourne to the place of purgacion/and shewe that he dyd nat the dede for any hate or malyce but either by folysshnes/or els by the entisement of some other/or for some prouable cause. And the promise faithfully that this faut shall teche hym to beware fro thens forth and also that theyr benefytes that forgyue hym shal bynde hym assuredly neuer to do so more/but perpetually to abhorte any suche offence/and with that to shewe some great hope ones to make them a great recopence & pleasure therfore agayne. After this let hym (yf he ca) declare some kynred betwene the & hym/or frendshyp of his elders/ & amplifye the greatenes of his seruice & good harte to warde them/yf it shall please them to forgiue this faut/& adde the nobylity of them that wolde fayne haue hym delyuered. And than he shall soberly declare his owne vertues & suche thynges as be in hym perteynynge to honeste and prayse/that he may by these meanes seme rather worthy to be auaunced in honour for his good qualities/than to be punished for his fall. This done/let hym reherce some other that haue be forgyuen greater fautes then this is. It shall also greatly auayle yf he can shewe that he hathe in tyme afore ben in auctoritie and bare a rule ouer other/in the whiche he was neuer but gentyll and glad to forgyue the that had offended vnderneth hym. And then let hym extenuate his owne faute/and shewe that there folowed nat so great damage therof/and that but lytle profyte or honesty wyll folowe of his punysshment. And finally then by comon places to moue the iudge to mercy & pytie vpon hym. The aduersary must (as I haue shewed afore) vse for his purpose contrary places. Some Rhetoriciens put no mo places of deprecacion than only this that is here last reherced of Tulli/that is to do our best to moue the iustice to mercy and pity. Remocion of the faute is whan we put it from vs and lay it to another. The Uenecians haue commaunded certayne to go in ambassade to Englande/ and therupon appointed the what they shal haue to bere their charges/ whiche money assigned: they can nat get of the treasourer: At the daye appoynted they go nat/wherupon they are accused to the Senate. Here they must ley the faut from them to the treasourer/which dispatched them nat accordyng as it was ordey ned that he shulde. Traslacion of the faut is/whan he that cofesseth his faut sayeth that he dyd it: moued by the indignacion of the malycyouse dede of an other. Kynge Agamenno/whiche was chief capitayne of the Grekes at the siege of Troye/whan he cam home was slayne of Egistus by the treason of Clitenestra his owne wyfe/whiche murder his sone Orestes seynge/whan he cam to mannes state/reuenged his fathers deathe on his mother/and slewe her/wherupon he was accused. Here Orestes can nat deny but he slewe his mother: But he layeth for hym that his mothers abhominable iniury constrayned hym thereto/bycause she slewe his father. And this is the handelynge of confyrmacyon in state assumptiue. The conclusions in these oracyons are lyke to the conclusions of other. State legitime is whan the controuersy standeth in defuncyon or contrary lawes/or doutfull wrytynges/or racyocynatyon/ or translacyon. Definicio (as Tully wryteth) is wha in any wrytynge is some worde put/ the significacio wherof requeth exposicio A lawe maye be made that suche as forsake a shyppe in tyme of tempest shulde lese theyr ryght that they haue/eyther in the shyppe or in any goodes within the same vessell/ & that they shall haue the shyp & the goodes that abyde styll in her. It chauced .ii. men to be in a lytle stayer/ of the whiche vessell the one man was both owner and gouernour/and the other possessour of the goodes. And as they were in the mayne see/they espied one that was swymmynge in the see/and as well as he coulde holdyng vp his handes to them for socour/wherupo they (beyng moued with pytie) made to warde hym/ & toke hym vp. Within a lytle after arose a greate tempest vpon them/and put the in suche ieopardy that the owner of the shyp (which was also gouernour) lepte out of the shyp into the shyp bote/& with ye rope that tyed the bote to the shyp: he gouerned the shyp as well as he colde. The marchant that was with in the shyp/for great dispayre of the losse of his goodes/wyllyng to flee hym selfe: threst hym selfe in with his ownes worde/but as it chaunced the wounde was neyther mortall nor very greuouse/but nat withstandyng for that tyme he was vnable to do any good in helpyng the shyp agaynst the impetuousnes of the storme. The thyrde man (whiche nat longe afore had suffered shyp wracke) gate hym to the sterne/and holde the vessell the best that laye in hym. At lengthe the storme seaced/and the shyp came safe into the hauen/bote and all. He that was hurt (by helpe of Chirurgiens) recouered anon. Nowe euery of these thre chalenge the shyp & goodes as his owne. Here euery man layeth for hym the lawe aboue reherced/and all theyr controuersy lyeth in the expoundynge of thre wordes/ abydynge in the shyp/and forsakynge the shyp/and what we shal in such case cal the shyp/whether the bote as part of the shyp: or els the shyp it selfe alone. The handelynge hereof is. Fyrst in few wordes and plaine to declare the significa cion of the worde to our purpose/and after suche maner as may seme resonable to the audience. Nexte/after suche exposicion to declare and proue the sayd exposicion true/ with as many argumentes as we can. Thyrdely to ioyne our dede with the exposicion/ & to shew that we onely dyd obserue the very entent of the lawe. Than to refell the exposicio of our aduersaries/& to shew that theyr exposicion is contrary to reaso and equitie/and that no wyse man wyll so take the law as they expounde it/and that the exposicion is neither honest nor profytable/ and to conster theyr exposicion with oures/and to shew that oures conteyneth the veritie/and theyrs is falce Oures honest/ reasonable/ & profitable: Theyrs clene contrarye. And then serche out lyke examples/ either of greater maters or of lesse/or els of egall maters/and to manifest by the that our mynde is the/very truthe. Contrary lawes are where the tone semeth euidently to contrarye the other. As yf a law were that he who his father hath forsaken for his sone/shall in no wyse haue any porcion of his fathers goodes. And an other lawe/that who so euer in tyme of tempest abydeth in the shyp: shall haue the shyp and goodes. Then pase that one whiche was of his father so abiecte & denyed for his chylde: was in a shyp of his fathers in tyme of sore wether/and whan al other for feare of lesynge themselfe for soke the shyp and gate them into the bote: he onely abode/and by chaunce was safe brought into the hauen/wherupon he chalengeth the vessel for his/where as the party defedant wyll lay agaynst him that he is abdicate or forsake of his father/& so can nat by the lawe haue any parte of his goodes. Here must he say agayn for hym that this law alleged doth all only priuate fro theyr fathers goodes suche as be abdicate & yet wolde chalenge a part as his children/but that he doth nat so/but requireth to haue the shyp/nat as a son to his father: but as any other straunger myght/seyng the law gyueth hym the shyp that abydeth in her in tyme of necessity. And so the handelyng of this state/eyther to deny one ofye lawes and shewe that hathe bene afore anulled/ or els to expounde it after the sence that is mete to our purpose. Doubtful wrytynge is where either the mynde of the author semeth to be contrary to that that is wryten/which som call wry tynge & sentence/or els it is whan the wor des may be expounded dyuers wayes. Men say it is a law in Caleys that no straunger may go vppon the towne walles on payne of dethe. Now than pose that in tyme of warre the towne beynge harde besieged/an alien dwellynge in the towne getteth hym to the walles amonge the souldiers/ & dothe more good than any one ma agayn. Now after the siege ended he is accused for trasgressyng of the lawe/ which in wordes is euidently against him But here the defendaunt must declare the wryters mynde by circumstaunces/what straunger he dyd forbyd/and what tyme/ and after what maner/and in what intent he wolde nat haue any straunger to come on the walles/ & in what intent his mynde might be vnderstanden to suffre an alien to go vpon the walles. And here must the effecte of the straugers wyl be declared/that he went vp to defed the towne to put back their enemies. And therto he must say that the maker was nat so vndiscrete & vnreasonable that he wolde haue no maner of excepcion which shuld be to the welth/profite/ or preseruacion of the towne. For he that wyl nat haue the law to be vnderstande ac cordyng to equitie/good maner/& nature/ entendeth to proue the maker therof either an vniust man/or folysshe or enuiouse. The accuser contraryly shall prayse the maker of the law for his great wisdom/for his playne writyng without any maner of ambiguity/that no strauger shulde psume to go vpon the walles/ & reherce the lawe word for worde/& the shew soe reasonable cause that mouyd the maker of ye law that he wolde vtterly that no strauger shuld ascende the walles.&c. Exaple of the secod. A Man in his testamet gyueth to two yonge doughters that he hathe two hudred shepe/to be delyuered at the day of theyr maryage/on this maner. I wyll that myne executoures shall gyue to my doughters at the tyme of theyr maryage euery of them an hundred shepe/suche as they wyll. At the tyme of maryage they de maunde theyr cattell/whiche the executours deliuer nat of suche sort as the maydes wold/wherupo the cotrouersy ariseth. For the executours say they are bounde to delyuer to euery of them an hundred shepe/ suche as they that be the executours wyll. Now here standeth the dout/to whom we shall referre this worde they/to the dough ters/or to the executours. The maydens say nay thereto/but that it was theyr fathers mynde that they shulde haue euery of them an .L. shepe/suche as they that be the doughters wyll. The handelyng of doutfull wrytyng is to shew yf it be possible that it is nat wryte doutfully by cause it is the como maner to take it after as we saye/ & that it may sone be knowen by suche wordes as partely go before that clause & ptly folow/& that there be few wordes/but if they be considered so alone/they may anon be taken doubtfully And first we shal shewe if we can that it is nat doubtfully wryten/for there is no reasonable man: but he wyl take it as we say. Than shall we declare by that that goeth afore/& foloweth/that it is clerly euyn as we say/& that yf we consider the wordes of the selfe they wyl seme to be of ambiguite but seyng they may by ye rest of the wrytig be euident ynough/they ought nat to be taken as doubtfull. And then shew that yf it had ben his minde that made the writyng to haue it taken as the aduersarye sayeth: he neded nat to haue wryte any such wordes. As in the example now put/the maydens may say that yf it had bene theyr fathers mynde that the executours shulde haue delyuered suche shepe as it had pleased them to delyuer: he neded nat to haue added these wordes such as they wyll. For yf they had nat ben put/it wolde nat haue bene dought but that the executers delyuerynge euery of them an hundred shepe (what so euer they were) had fulfylled the wyll/and coulde haue ben no further compelled/ wherfore if his mynde was as they say/it was a great folye to put in tho wordes whiche made a playne mater to be vnplaine. And than finally shew it is more ho nest and conuenient to expounde it as we say: then as our aduersaryes do. Raciocinacion is whan the mater is in countrouersy/wherupon no law is decreed/ but yet the iugement therof may be fouide out by lawes made vpon maters somdele resemblynge thereunto. As in Rome was this law made/that yf any persone were distraught /hispossessons and goodes shulde come to the handes of his next kynne. And an other law/what any householder dothe orden and make as concernynge his householde and other goodes/it is approbate and confirmed by the lawe. And an other law/if any housholder dye intestate/his monye & other goodes shall remayne to his nexte kyn. It chaunced one to kyll his owne mother/wherupon he was taken and condempned to deathe/ but whyle he lay in pryson/certayne of his familiare fredes cam thyther to hym/and brought with them a clerke to wryte his testament/whiche he there made/& made suche executours as it pleased hym. After his deth his kynnesme chalege his goodes his executours say them nay/wherupon aryseth controuersy afore the iustice. There is no lawe made vpon this case/ whether he that hathe kylled his mother may make any testamet or nat/but it may be reasoned on bothe partyes by the lawes aboue rehersed. The kynsmen shall allege the lawe made for the that be out of theyr myndes/presupposynge hym nat to be in muche other case/or els he wolde nat haue done the dede. The contrary parte shal allege the other lawe/and shewe that it was none alienacion of mynde: but some other cause that moued hym to it/and that he hathe had his punysshment therfore/whiche he shulde nat haue suffred of couenient if he had bene besyde hym selfe. Translacion is whiche the lawyers cal excepcion/as yf the person accused pleads that it is nat lawfull for the tother to accuse hym/or that the Iudge can be no iudge in that cause. &c. These are my speciall and singuler good Lorde whiche I haue purposed to wryte as touchyng the cheyf poynt of ye .iiii. that I layd in the begynnyng to long to a Rhetoricien/and which is more difficulty tha the other .iii. so that it ones had/there is no very great maystry to come by the besydue. Nat withstandyng yf I se that it be fyrst acceptable to your good lordship in whom nexte god and his holy saintes I haue put my chyef confidence and trust/ and after that yf I fynde that it seme to the reders a thyng worthy to be loked on/ and that your lordshyp and they thynke nat my labour take in vayne: I wyll assay my selfe in the other partes/and so make and accoplysshe the hole werke. But nowe I haue folowed the facion of Tully/who made a seuerall werke of inuencion. And though many thynges be lefte out of this treatyse that ought to be spoken of/yet I suppose that this shall be sufficyent for an introductyo to yonge begynners/for who all onely this boke is made. For other that bene entred all redy shal haue lytle nede of my labour/but they may seke more meter thynges for theyr purpose/either in Hermogines among the Greekes/or els Tully or Trapesonce/among the Latines. And to the that be yonge begynners nothynge can be to playne or to short/wherfore Horace in his boke of the craft of Poetry sayeth Quicquid precipies esto breuis ut cito dicta Percipiant animi dociles tenant que fideles. What so euer ye wyll teache (sayth he) be brief therin/that the mayndes of the herers or reders may the easlyer perceyue it/ and the better here it away: And the Emperour Justinian sayeth in the fyrste boke of his instructions in the paragraph of iustice and right/that ouer great curiosity in the fyrst principles/make hym that is studiouse of the facultie either to forsake it or els to attayne it with very great and tedyouse labour/and many tymes with great dispayre to com to the ende of his purpose. And for this cause I haue ben ferre lesse cu riouse then I wolde els haue ben/and also a great dele the shorter. If this my labour
