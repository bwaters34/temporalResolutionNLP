 and how he slewe his broder Remus that was Lorde of Raynes. As Romulus harde say of his broder Remus & of the towne of Raynes than was he very heuy for the walles of Raynes was so hygh that a man that stode in the deche myght nat schote ouer well with a hande bowe And ye the walles of Rome was so lowe that a ma myght wel lepe ouer and with no deches It fortuned that Remus went to see his broder Romulus at Rome And toke with hym manye folke after his estate and byrthe and lefte his wyfe in abydynge in the towne of Raynes in champanion with a lytyll chylde or yonge sone named Remus after his owne name and wha he was com before Rome and sawe the walles he sayd thre tymes that the walles were to lowe / moreouer he sayde with a ronne he wolde lepe ouer them and bye and bye he toke a ronne and lept klene ouer And wha his broder Romulus had harde this howe his broder had lepte ouer and sayde that he had done yll and therfore he shuld lese his hed therfore / And as Romulus dyd enter into his broders Romulus palayce than he toke Remus and he with his owne handes smote of his broders hed and slew hym and it was nat longe tyme after that he raysed a great armey of people thorowghe all his contreye and prepayred hym towarde the towne of Raynes in Champanien and began to set his ordinauce towarde the walles of the towne and dyd destroyed the palayce / Towers / castels / and other places to the erthe In so muche that he lefte but a fewe standynge or none, but he culde nat fynde the wyfe of remus his suster for she was fled a way out of the towne vnder the erthe at a false porte to hyr frendes & kynsfolke for she was one of the greatest borne women that was than there aboute. And as Romulus had destroyed the lande and towne of raynes he departed and went home toward the Cytie of rome with all his hooste where he was receyued rychely. slewe his vnkell romulus and afterwarde was made Emperoure and so reygned Emperoure. Than was the wyfe of remus very sadde and morned very sore when she knew of the dethe of hyr husbond and also of the destruccyon of the Towne of raynes destroyed by the the hades of hyr brother / caused that workeme shulde make the walles ageyne after hyr broders departyng fro it In so muche that she made the towne of raynes more stronger and fayrer than it was euer afore and renewed it rychely after hyr myght and power For she was nat of so great myght as she was when hyr husbonde was alyue. And also this noble lady norysshed hyr chylde well and within a lytyll space he began to wexe bygge and stronge and myghy a noughe to bere armure. Than sayde his moder to hym my dere sone whe wyll you wreke your faders dethe that youre vnkell slewe & he answered to his moder within this .iij. moneythes And forthe with he caused his kynsfolk to reyse theyr people and whe they were gathered departed He cam with a great power towarde rome / and whe he cam to rome he entered in there at no maner of bodye ageynste sayinge And when he was with in he made a crye that no man shuld do no romans harme Than wet he to the emperours paleyce and when the emperour knewe that he was come he asked counsayl and the Senyatours answered that there no remedy but deth by cause ye slewe his fader so shall he ageyne slee you / and with that cam i Remus in to the paleyce of his vnkle Remulus nobodye ayenst sayinge and there he sawe his his vnkell afore hym stand in his emperly stole than was he enflamed with yre drewe oute his swerde and toke his vncle by the here and smote of his hed and whan it was done he asked the lordes and Senyatours of rome or they wolde therfore warre and they answered all nay and gaue to hym the hole empyre and crowned hy as ryght heyer and wha he was emperour he sent for his moder and she cam to hym And tha was rome made with stronge walles & deches and than gatte Rome a great name and there haunted many dyuerse nacyons and they dyd buylde and edefye many fayre dwellynge places in rome. This Remus was a stronge man of bodye / ryche of good / wyse in counsayll / and had vnder hym many landes and lordshyppes This remus had a Knyght of his moders behalfe that was ryght hardy and bolde in batayle and he toke or maryed a wyfe in the Cytie of rome that was one of the greattest Senyours dawghters of rome and hyghest of lynage and remus reygned not longe after but dyed & his sone was made emperoure & reygned after hy and this Knyght of champanien that had maryed ye Senyatours dawghter he made great warre with hym & dyd hy very muche harme This knyght had one sone by his wyfe that wt great trauaiynge of laboure was bourne / and there was he named Virgilius of vigilo for by cause yt he was a great space of tyme watched so with men. As Virgilius was borne than the towne of rome quaked and tremled & in his youthe he was wyse and subtyll / and was put to schole. and shortly after dyed his fader and tha Virgilius moder wolde nomore marye ayen / for she loued hyr lorde so well / and after the decese of hyr husbond hyr kynsfolke wold haue put hyr fro hyr enherytannce that she had lynge wtin and without rome and one of the fayreste castels & strongest in all the towne or there abowt that coulde be emagened or made by any man And she complayned ofte to the emperour that was nere of kynne vnto hyr husbonde / but the emperour was a angerye man and wolde nat here hyr complayntes also he was nat beloued of the lordes nor of ye comon people / within short tyme after he decesyd And his sone & heyer Persydes was Emperoure after his faders dethe / and ruled after his owne mynde all the lande. And he had all the romans vnder hym in so muche that he ruled theym so strayghtly that they were sore a drad of hym / And Uirgilius was at schole at Tolenten where he stodyed dyligently for he was of great vnderstandynge / Vpon a tyme the scholers hadde lycence to goo to play and sporte them in the fyldes after the vsaunce of the holde tyme And there was also virgilius therby also walkynge amonge the hylles alle about it fortuned he spyed a great hole in ye syde of a great hyll wherein he went so depe that he he culde not see no more lyght and then he went a lyttell ferther therin and than he sawe som lyght agayne and than went he fourth streyghte and with in a lytyll wyle after he harde a voce that called virgilius virgilius and loked about and he colde nat see no bodye Than Virgilius spake and asked who calleth me than harde he the voyce ageyn but he sawe no body tha sayd he virgilius see ye not yt lyttyll boourde lyinge by syde you there marked with that word than Than answerd virgilius I see that borde well anough The voyce sayd doo a waye that bourd borde and lette me out there atte. Than answered virgilius to the voyce that was vnder ye lytell borde and sayd who art thou that calles me so / Tha answered the deuyll I am a deuyll couiured out of the body of a certeyne man and banysshed here tyll the day of iugemed without yt I be delyuered by the handes of men Thus virgilius I pray the delyuere me out of this payn and I shall shewe vnto the many bokes of nygromancy & howe thou shalt cum by it lyghtly and knowe the practyse therin that no man in the scyence of negromancye shall passe the And moreouer I shall showe and enforme ye so that thou shalte haue all thy desyre wherby my thyke it is a great gyfte for so lytyll a a doynge For ye may also thus all your power fredys helpe and make ryche / your ennemyes vnmygwty. Thorowgh that great promyse was Virgilius tempted / he badde the fynd showe the bokes to hym that he myght haue & occupy them at his wyll. & so the fynde shewed hym and than Uirg. pulled open a bourde and there was a lytell hole and therat wrage the deuyll out lyke a yeel / & cam and stode by fore Virgilius lyke a bygge man / wherof Virgilius was astoned and merueyled greatly therof yt so great a man myght come out at so lytyll a hole / tha sayd Virgilius shulde ye well passe into the hole that ye ca out of ye I shall well sayd the deuyll / I holde yt beste plegge that I haue ye shall not do it. well sayde the deuyll therto I consente and than the deuyll wrange hym selfe into the lytell hole ayen / and as he was there in / Virgilius kyuered the hole a geyn with the bourd close & so was the deuyll begyled and myght nat there come out ayen. but there abydeth shytte styll therin. Than called the deuyll dredefully to Virgilius and sayd what haue ye done Virgilius answered abyde there styll to your day apoynted. And fro thensforth abydeth he there. And so Virgilius beca very connynge in ye practyse of the blacke scyece. It was so that the moder of virgilius wexed olde in so muche that she loste hyr herynge tha called she one of hyr seruaters and sayd to hym ye must to Tolleten and tell Virgilius my sone that he come & redresse his enherytaunce with in and with out Rome. and gyue vp the schole / for he shulde be by ryght one of the greateste of all Rome / the messengere departed and wente toward Toleten where Virgilius was / & wha he cam there he founde Virgilius techyng and lernynge the greattest lordes of the Lande and other landes also / for I ensure ye he was a fayr and a wyse yonge man and conynge in the scyence of egramancye aboue all men than lyuynge / He salued Virgilius and shewed vnto hym all the mater that he cam for / and whan virgilius harde all the mater howe it was he was very heuy not for the good but for his moder / For Uirgllius had good anough / he rewarded the messenger and also sede his moder .iiij. somers lade with money and with other costely iewels and sende hyr also one whyte horse & so yt messegre toke his leue of virgilius and so departed. And virgilius abydyng styll in Tolenten emagened in his mynde / howe he myght beste conuey ye rest of his good to Rome & that he myght folowe. and whan he ordeyned & set in order all the rest he toke his leue & departed fro Tolente towarde Rome / wt many of his scholers wt hy wha he cam to Rome to his moder he salewed hys moder & she hym / For she was glad of his commmynge for she sawe hym nat afore by ye space of .xij. yeres afore. rome. As virgilius was com to rome he was ryceyued ryght worshypfullye of his power kynsfolke and not of the ryche for they with helde his landes oute of his hand / for that cause was he nat welcome to them but were angery of his comyng for they wolde nat ete with hym nor drynke with hym Than was virgilius angery and than gaue he to all his power kyndsfolke that with helde no thynge fro his moder / landes / harneyse / horses / syluer / and golde and other thynges / And he gaue to his Naybours great thankes for the kyndenes that they shewed to his moder in his absent After this dyd virgilius abyde longe tyme with his moder Tyll ye tyme that the emperour reysed a newe custom or taxke Than went all the lordes to the emperour that helde ony lande of hym and also virgilius wt all his company and many kynsfolke and frendes And whan he cam to fore hym he salewed hym and shewed vnto hym howe he was enheryted of his landes and tenementes and of those that with helde it and desyred that he myght haue it ageyne. Than answered the emperour that he shulde take therof counsayll And forth with he went to counsayll with them that loued not virgilius / and they answered to the emperour me thynketh that ye lande is well deuyded to them that hath it for they may helpe yon in your nede what nedethe you to care for the dysherytynge of one schle mayster and byd hym take hede & loke of his schole for he hath no ryght to any lande here aboute ye cytie of rome. and sayd that he must take pacyence by the space .iiij. or .v. yere that they myght examyne wt in our selfe whether ye be ryght eyer or no. and with that answere was Virgilius very angry and sayd that he shulde be auenged. And whan he cam home he sende for all his pore kynsfolke and fryndes and put them in his hoses & dwellynge places that he hadde within Rome. And purueyed theym of mete and drynke & byd the make mery tyll Iulio that the corne and frute is rype / And whan it was rype. Virgilius by his egromancy dyde caste the ayer ouer all the frute and corne of his landes that his enemyes hylde fro hym and caused it to be gathered and brought in to his howses that none of his enemyes had none therof. In this maner of wyse dyd Virgilius deseyue his enemyes of all the frutes & corne in so muche that they had not on pennys worthe theyr of that goodes that they witheld fro hym. And whan Virgilius enemyes sawe the frute so gathered. They assembled a great power and cam towarde Virgilius to take hym & smyte of his hed and whe they were assembled they were so stronge that the Emperour for fere fled oute of rome for they were .xij. Seniatours that had all the worlde vnder them. and Virgilius had had ryght he had ben one of ye .xij. but they had dysheryted hym and his moder. & when Virgilius knewe of theyr comynge he closed all his landes with the ayer rounde about all his lande that none lyuynge creature myght there come in to dwell ayenste his wyll or pleasure. As Virgilius enemyes cam to destroye & take hym and when they cam before his castell he closyd theym with the acyer that they had no myght to gowe nor forwarde nor backeward but abyde styll where of they merueyled and than virgilius answered ye cu to dysheryt me but ye shall nat and knowe ye well that you shall haue no profyte of the frutes as longe as I lyue And ye maye tell to the Emperour that I shall tary .iiij. or .v. yeres tyll he take counsayll I desyre nat to plete in the lawe but I shall take my good where I fynde it / and also tell the Emperour I care nat for all his warre nor all that he can do to me tha returned virgilius and made ryche all his poure kynsfolke and whan virgilius was returned than wente they home and knewe nat what they shulde do than cam they to the emperoure and complayned of virgilius and sayde that Virgilius sayde that he set nat by the empepoure and all that he couder make And whan the Emperoure harde this he was greatly a moued and sore a nangered and sayd that I shall brynne and set on fyer all his howses and also I shall smyte of his hedde and there with all not longe taryinge he caused his lordes & knyghtes that helde Lande of hym that they shulde reyse all theyr men of armes yt they had vnder them to be redy at a day at his commaudement / & at the day apoynted the Emperoure and all his hoost were asembled they toke theyr way towarde the place of Virgilius that was rounde aboute well walled and closed with the aeyr that whan the Emperour cam before the walles with all his hoste they myght nat gowe nor forwarde nor backewarde / And than went fro his castell fourthe Virgilius & with his negromancy he made also a lyght in suche maner that they coulde nat goo forwarde nor returne but stande styll And he made also by his cunyn that the Emperour thought that he was closed rounde aboute with a great water in so muche that they myght nat come to the castell nor for to come fro the castell but stode styll and this dyd dy Virgilius serue the emperaure and all hys hooste and moreouer cam Virgilius to the Emperoure and sayde / Lorde Emperoure ye haue no power with all your strength to do me harme nor my landes also / For be ryght ye shulde make of me as one of your greattest lordes and nerest of your kynred for I at your nede maye helpe you more than al your other folke. Than answered the Emperour to Virgilius you begyler maye I ons get you vnder my handes I wyll geue the yt / that thou hast deserued. Than answered Virgilius & sayd Lorde Emperoure I fere you nat but thynke you well that I shall tame you well a nowghe that ye shall be glade to knowe me for one of your kynsfolkes and of your blode but ye wolde dysheryte me but ye shall not. Than caused Virgilius muche mete to be dressed bytwene hys howse and the hoste that the Emperour and his folke myght se it & howe they dressed it but they myght haue none therof but the smoke or reke for they of the hoste was shytin with the aeyr as thowghe it hadde ben a great water / And so dyd Virgilius serue the Emperour and his folke / nor there was no body in his hoste that coulde fynde any remedy to helpe them there agayn / Vpo a tyme as they were in that thraldome afore the Castell there cam a man that colde skyll in the scyence of negromancy and cam afore the Emperoure and sayd that he wolde by hys practyce make slepe all Virgilius folke and so he dyd in so muche yt Virgilius his selfe myght scant withdrawe hy fro slepynge / than was he sorye and wyste nat what to do for ye Emperours folke was delyuered and began to come apon Virgilius walles And whan Virgilius sawe that he loked in his boke of negromancye where in he was very perfeyte and there he foude in what maner he myght delyuer his folke fro slepe and than he cungered that he made the Emperoure stande styll agene that he myght nat remeue out of his pla / nor all his folke nor the mayster of negromacy myght nat remeue nor styrre as thowgh they were deed and they that were vpon the ladders one fote vppe another downe and so stode styll / and also some stode with one fote on the lader another vpon ye wall and so for to stande styll tyll it pleased Virgilius. wherof ye Emperour was sore auexed and angery and asked his mayster if they shulde stande styll in that maner and he gaue hym no answere but he spake to virgilius and sayd that he whlde showe vpon hym his cunynge / and than Virgilius answered and bad hym do his beste for I set nat a strawe by you nor all that ye can do to me / And thus helde virgilius the Emperour and all his folke closed in this maner with the ayer by the space of a day / And in the nyght ca virgilius to ye Emperour & sayd It is a shame for so noble a pryce thus to stop the way & take vpon hym yt he can nat do. Than sayd the emperour to virgilius helpe me out of this daunger and I shall restore ageyne to you all your landes and tenementes & haue all thynges at your owne wyll. Tha answered virgilius to ye Emperoure I wyll delyuer you out of this dauger so that ye wyll gyue me grace. ye by my crowne and I knowe you for on of my kynred and I dessyre to haue you with me in my felawshyp. & than virgilius put awaye the closynge And reseyued the emperour and all his folke into his castell where golde and ryches were plenty. And serued them with mete & drynke ryght plentyously after theyr degre / of the deyntyest and strangest yt myght be gotte that they sawe neuer afore. And the emperour was there rychely serued. than euer he was before or after. And virgilius rewarded euery persone after his degree and with manye costely & meruelouse gyftes. and gooddes & gaue to hym many other thynges. Than toke they leue of Virgilius & retourned home ageyne / and wha they were returned home the emperour gaue to Virgilius his land ageyn and all that he asked. And was the greattest lorde of the Emperurs counsayll. After that it hapenyd that Virgilius was enamoured of a fayre lady the fayrest in all rome. Virgilius made a crafte in egromancy that tolde hir all his mynde / when the lady knewe his mynde she thowght in hyr selfe to deseyue hym And sayde that it was great daunger so to do but at ye laste she cosented & sayd if he wyll come at mydnyght to the castell walle she shulde lette dowe a basket with stronge cordes and there to drawe hym vppe at hyr wyndowe & so to Lye by by Hyr and haue his pleasur and wt this answere was virgilius very glad with yt answer and sayd he shulde doo it wt a good wyll. in ye basket when he was halfe way vp to hyr wyndowe & howe the people wondered & mocked hym. A Day was set that Virgilius sholde come to a tower that stode in the market place of rome and in all the towne was none so hygh and at the day apoynted Virgilius cam to the tower and the Gentylwoma was therat waytynge and as she sawe hym there stande she let downe the basket at the wyndowe and when it was done virgilius went in and whan he was therin she pulled hym vp tyll that he cam halfe waye and there she let hym hange and made ye corde faste / Than the gentylwoman spake ye be deceyued and I shall let you hange styll to morowe for it is market day that all the folke may woder of you and of your dyshoneste that you wolde haue do and lyne by me / and therewtall she shyt hyr wyndowe and let hym hange tyll the mornynge that it was daye tyll all the men in rome wyst it and also ye emperour that was ashamed and sent for the Gentylwoman and bad hyr let hym downe and so she dyd and whe he was downe he was ashamed and sayd that shortly after he wolde be auenged on hyr and so went home to his gardayne that was ye fayrest that stode with in Rome / tha toke he his bokes and by his connynge put out all the fyer that was in Rome / and none of them without myght bryng in fyer into the cytye / and this dured by the space of a daye and a nyght / but Virgilius had anowghe & no body els had nor myght not make no fyer with in Rome. The Emperoure and all his Barons and the comons of Rome merueyled that ther was no fyer in al the Cytie / & tha they thowght in theyr myndes that Virgilius had put it out. than the Emperour sent for Virgilius & prayd hym of his counsayll that men myght haue fyer ageyne / Tha must cause a scaffolde to be made in the mydle of the markd place / and than ye muste set the gentylwoman in hyr smocke that hynge me in the basket ysterday / and than lett make a crye thorwgh all ye Cytie of Rome whoso wyll haue ony fyer must come to the scaffolde in the market place / and there betwene the legges of the gentylwoman there they shuld haue fyer or other wyse none / and knowe that one ye other can gyue none nor sell none and thus ye must do if ye wyll haue ony fyer. whe they hard this they cam wt great multytude to ye scaffold. the towne went and fetched fyer at hyr tayle and also lyghte cadels betwene hyr legges. The Emperoure and all his lordes sawe yt there was no nother remedy but yt muste nedes do after Virgilius counsayll dyd cause a Saffolde to be made in the marked place & caused the gentyllwoman to be sett there on in hyr smocke and there men fetche fyer betwene hyr legges the pore men with candels and strawe & the ryche men lyghted they there theyr torches. Thre dayes must the gentylwoman stande in that manere or els they shulde haue no fyer. & after the thyrde day went the gentywoman home sore ashamed for she knewe well that Virgilius had done that violece to hyr. with in a whyle after maryed Virgilius a wyfe And when yt was done virgilius made a merueylous paleyce with .iiij. corners & as it was made he layed the Emperoure therin in one of ye corners and herde all that the men dyd say in that quarter & in lykewyse dyd he brynge hym in the other .iij. quarters and so he harde what the sayde in the other quartars of Rome and thus gowyng by the .iiij. quartars harde he what they sayde thorowe all Rome the myght nat speke so secretly but he harde it. The Emperour asked of virgilius howe yt he myght make Rome prospere and haue many landes vnder the And knowe when any lande wolde ryse agen theym & Virgilius sayd to ye Emperoure I woll wtin short space that do. and he made vpo the Capitolium that was the Towne house made with caruede ymages & of stone and that he let call Saluacio rome that is to say this is the saluacyon of the cytie of Rome and he made in the compace all the goddess that that we call mamettes & ydolles that were vnder the subiectio of Rome And euery of the goddes yt there were had in his hande a bell And in the mydle of the godes made he one god of Rome And when so euer that there was any land wolde make eny warre ageynst Rome / Than wolde the godes tourne theyr backes towarde the god of Rome And than the God of the land that wolde stade vp ageyne Rome clynked his bell so longe that he hathe in his hand tyll the senatours of Rome hereth it and forthwith they go there and see what lade it is that wyll make warre agaynste them and so they prepare the and goeth ageyne theym and subdueth theym this forsayde token knewe the me of Carthago that was sore agreued for the great harme that the Romans had done the and they toke a pryuay couseyll i what maner they myght destroy that worke / Than thought they in there mynde to sende .iij. men out and gaue them great multytude of golde and syluer and these .iij. men toke theyr leue of the lordes and wet towarde the Cytie of Rome and when they were come to rome they reported them selfe sothesayers and trewe dremers / Upon a tyme wente these .iij. men to a hyll that was within the cytie and there they buryed a great pott of money very depe in the erthe and when that was done and kynered ageyne they wet to the brygge of Tyber and let fall in a certayne place a great baryll with golden pens & when this was done these thre men went to the seniatours of Rome and sayd worshypfull lordes we haue this nyght edremed yt with in the fote of a hyll here with in Rome is a great pot with money / wyll ye lordes graunte to vs and we shall do the coste to seke there after and the lordes consented And than they toke laberours and delued the money out of the erthe. and when it was done they wet another tyme to the lordes and sayde worshypfull Lordes we haue also dremed that in a certeyne place of Tyber lyeth a barellfull of golde pens if that you wyll graunte to vs that we shall goo seke it and the lordes of Rome thynkyng no dysceyte grauted to those sothesayers and badde them do that that they shulde do there best and than the sothesayers was glad and than the hyred shyppes & men and went toward the place where is was and when they were come the sowgh in euerye place there about and at the laste founde the barelfull of golden pens wherof they were glade And than they gaue to the lordes costely gyftes And than to [illeg.] come to theyr purpose they cam to lordes ageyne and sayd to them worshypfull lordes we haue dremed ageyne that vnder the fundacyon of Capitolium there where Saluatio Rome standeth be .xij. barelles full of golde And pleasyth you lordes that you wolde graut vs lycence it shall be to your great auantage / and the lordes styrred with couytayse grauted them by cause .ij. tymes afore they tolde trewe wherof they were glad gatte laberours and began to dygge vnder the fundacyon of Saluatio Rome and whe they thought that they had dygged anoughe they departed fro Rome and the next daye folowynge fell that house downe and all the worke that Virgilius hadde made & so the lordes knewe that the were deseyued and were sorowfull & after that hade nat no fortune as they had afore tymes. and yll doers myght be ryd out of the stretes. The Emperour had manye complayntes of the nyght ronners and theues and also of great murderynge of people in the nyght in so muche that the Emperour asked counsayll of Virgilius and sayd that he hath great coplayntes of the theues that ronyth by nyght for they kyll many me what cousayll Virgilius is best to be done. Than answred virgilius to the Emperour ye shall let make a horse of coper and a coper man apon his backe hangynge in his hades a flayll of yron & that horse ye shall do brynge a fore the towne howse and then ye shall lett crye that a man fro henseforth at .x. of the clock shulde ryng a bell And he that after ye bell was ronge in the strete shulde be slayne no worke therof be done And whan this crye was made the roffyas set nat a poynt but kept the stretes as they dyd afore and wolde nat let therfore / & as sone as the bell was ronge at .x. of the clocke than lept the horse of coper with the coper man thorowgh the stretes of Rome insomuche that he lefte nat one strete i rome vnsowght and as sone as he founde any Man or woman in the strete he slewe them starke deed isomuche that he slewe aboue .CC. persones or more / & this seyng the hours and nyght rouers howe they myght fynd a remedy therfore thought i theyr myndes to make a dragge wt a ladder theron. And as they wolde gowe out be nyght they toke theyr ladders with them & when they harde the horse come / than caste they the dragge vpon the howses and so went vp apon theyr ladders to the toppe of the howses so that the coper man myght nat toche them and so abyd they styll in theyr wycked doyng / Than cam they agene to the Emperoure and complayned and than the Emperoure asked counsayll of Virgilius And Virgilius answered and sayd that ye must get to coper houdes and set them of ether syde of ye the coper horse and let cry ageyne that no body after ye bell is ronge shulde departe out of theyr house yt wolde lyue / but ye nyghtwalkers carede nat a poynt for that crye But when they harde the horse comynge with theyr laders clymed apon the howse but the dogges lept after and tered them all to peces And thus the noyse went thorowgh rome in so muche that no body durst in the nyght go in the strete. and thus all the nyght walkers were destroyed. For profeyte of the comon people dyd Virgilius on a great myghty marbell pyller dyd made a brygge that cam vp to the paleyce and so went Virgilius well vp the Pyller oute of the paleyce that paleyce and the Pyller stode in the myddel of Rome & vpon this pyller made he a lape of glasse that all waye byrned without gowyng out and no body myght put it out and this lampe lyghtened ouer all the Cytie of Rome fro the one corner to the other and there was nat so lytell a strete but it gaue suche lyght yt it semed .ij. torches there had stande and vpo the walles of the palayce made he a metall ma that helde in his hade a metall bowe that poynted euer vpon the lampe for to shote it out But alway burned the lampe and gaue lyght ouer all Rome and vpo a tyme went the burgeyses daughters to play in the paleyse behelde ye metall man and one of them asked i sporte why he shat nat and than she cam to the man and with hyr hande toched the bowe & than the bolte flew out and brake the lampe that Virgilius made. And it was wonder that the mayden went nat out of hyr mynde for the great fere that she had And also the other Burgeyses daughters that were in hyr companye of the great stroke that it gaue when it hyt the lampe / And when they sawe the metall man so swytly ronne his waye And neuer after was he no more sene and this forsayd lampe was abydynge byrnynge after the deth of Virgilius by the space of .CCC. yeres or more. goodlyest that euer culde be funde in all the worlde. Great wonder dyd Virgilius in his tyme for after that palayce he made an horcharde wherin he set all maner of trees berynge frute and also many herbes growynge in that yarde And as the tyme was sawe men dayly rype frute fayre blossoms full plentyous In ye myddell of the orcharde was a fayer clere foutayne the fayrest that euer was sene & in this orchard was many dyuers of byrdes syngyng for they myght well cum in But the culde no more flye out ageyne for it was closed in suche maner wt the ayer / and men harde also theyr byrdes syng that was with in and culde nat goo forth also he had in his orcharde all maner of tame bestes yt were profitable for men also he made of the water than ran out of the fountayn a standynge water about the trees the clerest that myght be and there in was of all maner of fysshe that culde be thought Also in this orcharde was all maner of Ioyfulnes bothe of trees / herbes / fowles And Bestes thereof that men myght thynke or inmaganed by mannes reasons Also he dyd make greatter thynges than all this for he made a Vaute or seller in the orcharde the fayreste that myght be made thought by mannes reason In whiche Seller he made for to put in his money and ryches that he had for he was so ryche and so great multitude yt he knewe no ende And set .ij. metall men before the dore to kepe it and in eche hande a great hamer & therwt they smyte apon a anuylde one after the other in so muche that the byrdes that flye ouer hereth it & by and bye falleth there downe deed And other wyse had Virgilius not his good kepte. A Image made Virgilius a hye in the ayer that myght nat fall and the people of Rome myght nat open noder wyndowe nor doer but they must nedes see it And this Image had this properte that no woman after she had seen the Image had no luste to do bodely lust. & therfore the women had great enuy and they complayned theym to Virgilius wyfe yt they theyr sporte and dalyinge had loste and prayed hyr yt she wolde destroye that Image and make it fall And than wayted virgilius wyfe hir tyme and went vp the brygge of the ayer and cast downe the Image and than dyd the women theyr wyl And when Virgilius cam and founde his Image downe he was very angery and sayd to his selfe that it shulde nat auayll them for he wolde set it vp ageyne. and swore that he shuld know who had caste it downe and he set it ageyne and asked his lady & she had castedone it & she sayd naye And than cam the women ageyne to virgilius wyfe and sayd that it was worse than it was before and prayed hyr that she shulde caste it downe ageyne and than Virgilius went pryuyley into a corner and wayted his wyfe for he had sene before howe the women had complayned them to hyr And then went virgilius wyfe and caste downe the Image And virgilius that had hyd hym & sawe howe his wyfe had caste it downe & wt a anger wold haue cast hyr after wt the ymage and he sayd the deuyll satysfye you for I dyd it for the beste but I shall neuer more medyll but I shall let the women do theyr wyll and fro thenseforthe began Virgilius to hate his wyfe. Often tymes herde Virgilius tell of ye fayrnes of the sodans dawghter in so muche yt he was Enamoured of Hyr thoughe he neuer sawe hyr than by his conynge made he a brygge in the ayer and went ouer to hyr and when he had spoke with hyr and showed hyr his mynde than she consented to hym Not withstandynge she neuer sawe hym afore. And she sayde on a nyght that she wolde departe with hym into his countre and knowe what maner a man he were and what dwellyng he had. Than answered Uirgillus and sayde to hyr that wyll I doo but ye shall passe ouer many landes & you shall not trede in them than caryed he hyr ouer into his owne lade ouer the brygge that he had made in the ayer and so browght hyr to Rome and he was at home he asked hyr if she sawe no body and she sayd no but hym alone And thanne showed Virgilius to hyr hys palayce & orchard and the metall me that stode styll apece smytynge and he shewed to hyr also all his treasur and he presented it to hyr and she wolde nat reseyue it sayinge that she had to muche of hyr faders to kepe And Virgilius helde hyr in his orcharde as longe as it please hym. And as the Soadan founde nat is dawgwter he was sorofull for because he noste nat where she was become and they sowght all obout but in no place they culd they fynde hyr. lande & howe he fun. hyr sleppynge apon hyr bedde. Whan he Sodans dawghter had byd loge with Virgilius in his orcharde than desyred she to goo home to hyr faders lade and than toke Virgilius the Sodans dawghter in his harmes and caste hyr vpon the brygge in ye ayer and he his selfe brought hyr to hyr faders palayce and put hyr in hyr chaumber apon hyr bed and than he betoke hyr to the goddes and so returned he home to his place towarde Rome. And in the begynnynge of the day arose the soda yt was sore vexed for the lesynge of his dawter and than cam one of hyr chamberlaynes to the Emperoure and tolde hym howe his dawghter was come ageyne and lay vpon hyr bed and slepte Than ca he to hyr hastely and asked hyr where she had bene and how she was come there ageyne Fader sayd she there was a fayre man of a straunge lade and he brought me thorowghe the ayer to his paleyce & orcharde but I haue nat spoke to man nor woma but to hy alone and I knowe nat what lande it is The sodan answered and sayde to hyr that she shulde brynge some of the frute of that cuntrey wt hyr and she sayd she wolde And with in a wyle cam virgilius to babylone and toke the sodans daughter with hym ageyne and so departed agey to his cuntrey with hir & kept hir longe as pleased hym and when she departed ageyne she toke with hir walnottes and other frue. and whe she was come home she shewed hyr fader ye walnuttes & other frutes of the lande. Ha ha sayde he it is on the syde of fraunce that so often hath borne you away. The Sodan cam vpon a tyme to his dawghter and sayde my dawghter when he commethe a gene to you that was wonte to carey you away gyue to hy this drynke that I shall gyue to you or he slepe with you but drynke you none thereof I warne you for whe he hath drynkyn therof he shall slepe and when he is aslepe let me knowe therof than shall we take hym & knowe fro whes he is And the lady dyd as she was comauded And when virgilius was com she gaue hym to drynke of the drynke that hir fader gaue hyr and when he had drunke he slepte & so was taken Than was virgilius brought to the Sodan and the lordes and also the dawter of the Sodan And than the Sodan showed his knyghtes that that was the man that had stolen his dawghter away and than he sayd to virgilius ye be welcome for your pleasure that haue had ye shall suffer dethe Than answered Virgilius to the Sodan I wolde that I had neuer sene hir and if that ye wyll let me gowe I shall neuer come ageyne. Than answered the Sodan and the lordes that shall we nat do but for youre myssedede ye shall suffer a shamefull dethe. Than answered the Sodans dawghter yf ye put hym to deth I shall suffer deth with hy Than andswered the Sodan therto I consente for ye shall be burned with hym Than answered Virgilius that shall you nat do with all the strenght and myght that ye can do thoughe ye be of so great power. dawghter and how he foundred the towne of napels. Whan Virgilius harde of this he made with his cunnyng that the Sodan and all his lordes that the great ryuer of Babylon was in the myddell amonge them ranne and yt they swemed and laye and spronge lyke duckes And thus toke Virgilius with hym the fayre lady vpon the brygge in the ayer and when they were bothe vpon the brygge / he delyuered the Sodan fro the ryuere and all the lordes & than they sawe Virgilius caray awaye his dawghter ouer the see apon a brygge in the ayer wherof he marueyled and was very sorye and wyste nat what to do for he culde nat remedy it / And in this maner dyd he couey the Sodas dawghter ouer the see to Rome / And Virgilius was sore enamored of that lady Than he thought in his mynde howe he myght mareye hyr & thought in his mynde to founde in ye myddes of the see a fayer towne with great landes belongyng to it And so he dyd by his cunnynge / and called it Napells And the fundacyon of it was of egges and in that Towne of Napells he made a tower with .iiij. corners and in ye toppe he set a napyll vpon a yron yarde & no man culde pull awaye that apell with out he brake it. and thorowghe that yron set ye a bolte and on that bolte set he a egge And he henge the apell by the stauke apon a cheyn and so hangeth it styll And whenne the egge styrreth so shulde the towne of napels quake and wha the egge brake than shuld the towne synke when he had made a nende he lette call it Napels And i this towne he layed a parte of his treasur that he had therin And also set therin his louer the fayer lady ye sodans dawghter and he gaue to hyr the towne of Napels and all the lande therto belongynge to hir vse and hyr chyldren And within short whyle after he maryed hyr to a sertayne lorde or knyght of spayn with in shorte wyle after it fortuned that ye Emperour had a great fantasy to the towne of Napels for it bare the name in that tyme for one of the fayrest in the world and it lay also in the fayrest market place aboute Rome. Than secretly sende the emperour letters to all his lordes that were vnder hym that they shulde as shortly as they myght rayse theyr folke & to come to Rome for to besege the Towne of Napels & so they dyd insomuche that they assembled a great copanye and went towarde the towne of Napels and destroyed all afore hym And whe he was come to Napels he beseged it And the knyght yt maryed the lady that was within Napels defeded the towne nobely ageynste the emperoure and all his hooste And in the meane wyle sente this knyght a messengere to Virgilius whiche tolde hym all howe the Emperour beseged the towne of Napels wherwith Virgilius was angery and sent worde that the knyght shulde nat set behy nor all his hoost for I shall prouyde well a nough for you and so departed the messenger to Napels. And when Virgilius knewe that the Emperoure beseged Napels tha made he all the fresshe waters to be lyke rayne in suche maner that ye Emperours folke had neuer a drop of water and they of napels had anoughe / and in the meane season reysed virgilius his hoste & cam towarde the Emperoure to Napels / But the emperour myght no lenger taray for ye horse and men dyed for faute of water & so he loste a great parte of theym / Than the Emperoure seynge this departed home ageyn to the Cytie of Rome all eschamed and dyscunfyt / and as he returned homewarde in the waye he met with Virgilius comynge with all his company towarde Napels And when virgilius sawe the emperoure He ca to hym and salued hym in this manere. O noble Emperoure howe fortuned this to you that be soo noble a prynce as you be to gyue vp the seage of Napels and to returne home agene to the Cytie of Rome all dyscumfit without doynge any harme at all so schortly / Than wyste the Emperoure well that Virgilius mocked hym and he was therwt very angery And than went Virgilius to Napels and he caused the Lordes of the Towne to make a othe that they shulde berye no Romans within the forsayde towne. Merchauntes. As virgilius had reseyued the othes of the lordes of Napels / than returned he ageyne to Rome and fetched his bokes & other moueable goodes and browght it to Napels and let his good alone that he had shet in the seller And his dwellynge he gaue to his frendes to kepe & his dwellynge places & so departed to Naples there he made a schole & gaue therto muche landes that euery scholer abydynge and gowyng to schole had lande to lyue on of the towne and they that gaue vp the schole they loste the lande and there cam many fro Tuleten to schole And whe he had ordeyned the towne well with scholers And tha made he a warme bath that euery man myght bathe hym in that wolde / and that bathe is there to this tyme and it was the fyrste bathe that euer was And after this made he a brygge the fayrest that euer me sawe and there myght men se all maner of fayer shyppes that belonged to merchautedyse & all other thynges of ye see And yt towne in those dayes was ye fayrest and noblest in all the worlde And in this schole afore sayde dyde Virgilius rede the great conynge and scyaunce of Egromancy for he was the conyngest that euer was afore or after in yt scyence And within schorte space his wyfe dyed and she had neuer no chyldren by hym And moreouer aboue all men he loued scholers and gaue them muche moneye to bye bokes with all & thus he ruled them ryght nobely for he myght do it ryght well for he was one of the greateste borne men of all the world and had been ye greatest lorde of all Rome. Than made Virgilius at Rome a Metall Serpent with his cunnynge that who so euer put his hande in the throte of the Serpent to swere his cause ryght and trewe. And if hys cause were false he shulde nat plucke his hande out ageyne & if it were trewe they shuld plucke it out ageyne without any harme doynge So it fortuned that there was a knyght of Lumberdye that mystrusted his wyfe wt one of his men that was moost set by in the conseyte of his wyfe But she excused hyr selfe ryght nobelye and wysely And she consented to goo wt hym to Rome to that Serpent and there to take hyr othe that she was nat gylty of that / that he put apon hyr. And therto consented the knyght & as they were bothe in the carte and also hyr man with hyr she sayd to the man that when he cam to rome that he shulde clothe hym with a Foles cote and dysgyse hym in suche maner that they shulde nat knowe hym and so dyd he and when the daye was come that he shulde come to the Serpent he was there present And virgilius knowinge the falsenes of the woman by his cunnynge of Egromancy And than sayde virgilius to the woman with drawe your othe & swere not but she wolde nat do after hym but put hyr hade into the Serpentes mouthe And when hyr hande was in she sware before hyr husbande yt she had no more to do with hym than with that fole that stode hyr by And by cause that she sayd trowthe she pulled out hyr hande ageyne out of the throte of the serpent nat hurt and than departed ye knyght home & trusted hyr wel euer after. And Virgilius hauyng therat great spyte and anger that the woman hade so escaped destroyed the Serpent for thus scaped the lady awaye fro that great daunger. And than spake Virgilius and sayde that the women be ryght wyse to enmagyn vngracyousenes but in goodnes they be but innocentes. Thus as Virgilius i his lyfe had done many maruylous and sotyll thynges And also had promysed to the Emperour many other dyuerse thynges and meruylouse For he promysed to make the Trees and spyces to bere frute thre tymes in a yere And euery tree shulde haue rype frute and also blossomes at one tyme theron growynge Also he shulde maken ye shyppes for to sayle ageynste the streme as with the streme at all tymes And he wolde haue made ye peny to be as lyghtely gat as spente And ye women shulde be delyuered of theyr chylderne wtout any maner felynge anye payne at all And these thynges afore sayde promysed Virgilius to the Emperour for to do & many other dyuerse here thynges that were to longe for to reherce If that it fortuned hym nat to dye in the mene wyle And after this made Virgilius a goodly castell that hadde but one goynge in therto / and no man myght nat enter in therto but at yt one gate or els nat And also aboute the same castell flowed there a water & it was vnpossyble for any man ther to haue anye enterynge And this castell stode without the cytie of Rome and this enterynge of this Gate was made with .xxiiij. yron flayles and on euery syde was there xij. men on ece syde styll a pece smytynge with the flayles neuer seasynge the oon after ye other and no man myght cum i wihtout the flayles stode styll but he was slayne And these flayles was made with suche agyn that virgilius stopped them when he lyst to enter in therat but no man els culde fynde the way. And in this castel put Virgilius parte of his treasure therin pryuyly And when this was done he enmagyned in his mynde by what meane he myght make his selfe yonge ageyn by cause he thought to lyue longer many yeres to do manye & wonders merueylouse thynges And vpon a tyme went Virgilius to the Emperoure and asked hym of lycence by the space of .iij. wekes But the Emperoure in no wyse wolde graunt vnto hym for he wolde haue Virgilius at all tymes by hym. Than harde he that Ulrgilius went to his howse and toke with hum one of his men that he aboue all men trusted & knewe well that he wolde best kepe his counsayll and they departed to his castell that was without the towne & when they were afore the castell there sawe the man men stande with yron flayles in theyr handes sore smytynge Than sayd Virgilius to his ma enter you fyrste into the castell Than answered the ma and sayd if I shulde enter ye flayles wolde slee me. Than shewed Virgilius to the man of eche syde the enterynge in and all the vyces yt therto belonged and when he had shewed hym all the wayes he made sease the flayles & went into the castell & when they were bothe in Virgilius turned the vyces ageyne and so went ye yron flayles as they dyd afore Then sayde virgilius my dere beloued frende / and he that I aboue all me truste / & knowe moost of my secret And than led he the ma into the seller where he had made a fayer lampe at all seasons burnynge And than sayd Virgilius to the man Se you the barell that standeth here & he sayde ye theri muste put me fyrste ye muste slee me and hewe smalle to peces and cut my hed in .iiij. peces and salte the heed vnder in the bottum and then the peces there after and my herte in the myddel & and then set the barell vnder the lampe that nyght and daye therin may droppe and leke and ye shall .ix. dayes longe ones in the daye fyll the lampe and fayle nat And when this is all done than shall I be renued and made yonge ageyn and lyue longe tyme and maney wynters mo If that it fortune me nat to be taken of aboue & dye And when the man harde his master virgilius speke thus he was sore abasshed and sayd that wyll I neuer whyle I lyue for i no maner wyll I slee you And than sayd Virgilius ye at this tyme must do it for it shall be no grefe vnto you And at the last Virgilius treated his man so muche that he consented to hym and then toke the seruaunt virgilius and slewe hym And when he was thus slayn he hewe hym in peces and salted hpm in the barell and cut his heed in iiij. peces as his mayster bad hym and than put the herte in the myddell and salted them wele & when all this was was done he hynge the lampe ryght ouer the Barell that it myght at all tymes droppe in therto And when he had done all this he went out of the Castell And turned the vyces and then wente the coper men smyghtynge wt theyr flayles so strongly apon ye yron anueldes as they dyd afore that there durste no ma enter and he came euery daye to the castell and fylled the Lampe as Virgilius had bad hym And as the Emperour myssed Virgilius by the space of seuen dayes he merueyled greatly where he shulde be bycome but virgilius was kylled and layed in the seller by his seruaunt that he loued so wele And than the emperour thought in his mynde to aske virgilius seruaunt where virgilius his mayster was and so he dyd for he knew well that virgilius loued hym aboue all men in the worlde Than answered the seruaunte to the Emperour and sayde worschpfull Lorde and it please your grace I wat nat where he is For it is seuen dayes past that I sawe hym laste / and than wente he forthe I cannot tell whyther for he wolde nat let me goo with hym Than was ye Emperoure angery with that answere & sayd thou lyest falce thefe that thou art but without thou showe me shortely where he is I shall put the to dethe wt those wordes was the man abasshed and sayd / worshypfull lorde seuen dayes agoo I went with hym without the towne to the castell and there he went in and there I lefte hy for he wolde nat let me in with hym. Tha sayd the Emperour goo with me to the same Castell and so he dyd & when they cam afore the castell and wolde haue entered they myght nat bycause flayles smyt so faste Than sayde the Emperoure make pease this flayles that we maye cu in Than answered the ma I knowe nat ye way than sayd the Emperour than shall thou dye / & than thorowgh the fere of dethe he turned ye vyce and made the flayles stande styl and then the Emperoure entered into the castell with all his folke & sowghte al aboute in euery corner after Virgilius and at the laste they sowght so longe that they cam into the seller where they sawe ye lampe hange ouer the barell where Uirgilius lay in deed Than asked the Emperoure ye man who had made hy so herdey to put his mayster Virgilius so to dethe and the man answered no worde to the Emperoure And than the Emperour with great anger drewe oute his swerde & slewe he there virgilius man And whe all this was done Than sawe the Emperoure and all his folke a naked chylde .iij. tymes rennynge aboute the barell saynge the wordes. Cursed be the tyme that ye cam euer here / and with those wordes vanysshed the chylde awaye and was neuer sene ageyne and thus abyd virgillus in the barell deed. Then was the Emperour very heuy for the dethe of virgilius and also all virgilius kynred and also all ye scholers that dwelled aboute the towne of Napels and in especyall ye Towne of Napels for by cause that Virgilius was yt founder therof and made it of great worshyp Than thought the Emperoure to haue ye good & ryches of Virgilius but there were none so wardey that durste cum in to fetche it for fere of the coper men that smote so faste with theyr yron flayles and so abyd virgilius treasure in the seller. And Uirgilius dyd many other merueylouse thynges that in this boke is not wryten. And thus gyue vs grace that we may be in the boke of euer lastynge blysse. Amen. ¶ Thus endethe the Lyfe of Virgilius with many dyuers consaytes that he dyd Emprynted in the Cytie of Anwarpe By me Iohn Doesborcke dwellynge at ye the camerporte.
