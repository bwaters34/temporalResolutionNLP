 of literary education, we meet with no attempt to unfold the principles of this art, or to reduce it to rules. In the works of Quinctilian, of Cicero, and of the Younger Pliny, we find many passages which prove that these authors had made translation their peculiar study; and, conscious themselves of its utility, they have strongly recommended the practice of it, as essential towards the formation both of a good writer and an accomplished orator  1 . But it is much to be regretted, that they who were so eminently well qualified to furnish instruction in the art itself, have contributed little more to its advancement than by some general recommendations of its importance. If indeed time had spared to us any complete or finished specimens of translation from the hand of those great masters, it had been some compensation for the want of actual precepts, to have been able to have deduced them ourselves from those exquisite models. But of ancient translations the fragments that remain are so inconsiderable, and so much mutilated, that we can scarcely derive from them any advantage  2 . To the moderns the art of translation is of greater importance than it was to the ancients, in the same proportion that the great mass of ancient and of modern literature, accumulated up to the present times, bears to the general stock of learning in the most enlightened periods of antiquity. But it is a singular consideration, that under the daily experience of the advantages of good translations, in opening to us all the stores of ancient knowledge, and creating a free intercourse of science and of literature between all modern nations, there should have been so little done towards the improvement of the art itself, by investigating its laws, or unfolding its principles. Unless a very short essay, published by M. D'Alembert, in his M elanges de Litterature, d'Histoire, &c. as introductory to his translations of some pieces of Tacitus, and a few reflections of the Abbe Batteux, in his Principes de la Litterature , I know of nothing that has been written upon the subject. The observations of M. D'Alembert, though extremely judicious, are too general to be considered as rules or even principles of the art; and the precepts of the Abb e Batteux are chiefly of a grammatical nature, and seem to have for their sole object the ascertainment of the analogy that one language bears to another, or the pointing out of those circumstances of construction and arrangement in which languages either agree with, or differ from each other  3 . at all wonderful, that amidst the numberless translations which every day appear, both of the works of the ancients and moderns, there should be so few that are possessed of real merit. The utility of translations is universally felt, and therefore there is a continual demand for them. But this very circumstance has thrown the practice of translation into mean and mercenary hands. It is a profession which, it is generally believed, may be exercised with a very small portion of genius or abilities. "It seems to me," says Dryden, "that the true reason why we have so few versions that are tolerable, is, because there are so few who have all the talents requisite for translation, and that there is so little praise and small encouragement for so considerable a part of learning." Pref. to Ovid's Epistles. there are men of genius among the moderns who have vindicated the dignity of this art so ill-appretiated, and who have furnished us with excellent translations, both of the ancient classics, and of the productions of foreign writers of our own and of former ages. These works lay open a great field of useful criticism; and from them it is certainly possible to draw the principles of that art which has never yet been methodized, and to establish its rules and precepts. Towards this purpose, even the worst translations would have their utility, as in such a critical exercise, it would be equally necessary to illustrate defects as to exemplify perfections. the author solicits indulgence, both for the imperfections of his treatise, and perhaps for some errors of opinion. His apology for the first, is, that he does not pretend to exhaust the subject, or to treat it in all its amplitude, but only to point out the general principles of the art; and for the last, that in matters where the ultimate appeal is to Taste, it is almost impossible to be secure of the solidity of our opinions, when the criterion of their truth is so very uncertain. Description of a good Translation.---General Rules flowing from that Description. describe what is meant by a good Translation , it is evident that a considerable progress would be made towards establishing the Rules of the Art ; for these Rules would flow naturally from that definition or description. But there is no subject of criticism where there has been so much difference of opinion. If the genius and character of all languages were the same, it would be an easy task to translate from one into another; nor would any thing more be requisite on the part of the translator, than fidelity and attention. But as the genius and character of languages is confessedly very different, it has hence become a common opinion, that it is the duty of a translator to attend only to the sense and spirit of his original, to make himself perfectly master of his author's ideas, and to communicate them in those expressions which he judges to be best suited to convey them. It has, on the other hand, been maintained, that, in order to constitute a perfect translation, it is not only requisite that the ideas and sentiments of the original author should be conveyed, but likewise his style and manner of writing, which, it is supposed, cannot be done, without a strict attention to the arrangement of his sentences, and even to their order and construction  4 According to the former idea of translation, it is allowable to improve and to embellish; according to the latter, it is necessary to preserve even blemishes and defects; and to these must likewise be superadded the harshness that must attend every copy in which the artist scrupulously studies to imitate the minutest lines or traces of his original. As these two opinions form opposite extremes, it is not improbable that the point of perfection should be found between the two. I would therefore describe a good translation to be, That, in which the merit of the original work is so completely transfused into another language, as to be as distinctly apprehended, and as strongly felt, by a native of the country to which that language belongs, as it is by those who speak the language of the original work. Now, supposing this description to be a just one, which I think it is, let us examine what are the laws of translation which may be deduced from it. I.   That the Translation should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original work. --- II.   That the style and manner of writing should be of the same character with that of the original. III.   That the Translation should have all the ease of original composition. variety of subordinate precepts, which I shall notice in their order, and which, as well as the general laws, I shall endeavour to prove, and to illustrate by examples. First general rule---A Translation should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original work.---Knowledge of the language of the original, and acquaintance with the subject.---Examples of imperfect transfusion of the sense of the original. ---What ought to be the conduct of a Translator where the sense is ambiguous. the ideas of the original work, it is indispensably necessary, that he should have a perfect knowledge of the language of the original, and a competent acquaintance with the subject of which it treats. If he is deficient in either of these requisites, he can never be certain of thoroughly comprehending the sense of his author. M. Folard is allowed to have been a great master of the art of war. He undertook to translate Polybius, and to give a commentary illustrating the ancient Tactic, and the practice of the Greeks and Romans, in the attack and defence of fortified places. In this commentary, he endeavours to shew, from the words of his author, and of other ancient writers, that the Greek and Roman engineers knew and practised almost every operation known to the moderns; and that in particular, the mode of approach by parallels and trenches, was perfectly familiar to them, and in continual use. Unfortunately M. Folard had but a very slender knowledge of the Greek language, and was obliged to study his author through the medium of a Latin translation, executed by a Jesuit who was entirely ignorant of the art of war. M. Guischardt, a great military genius, and a thorough master of the Greek language, has shewn, that the work of Folard contains many capital misrepresentations of the sense of his author, in his account of the most important battles and sieges, and has demonstrated, that the complicated system formed by this writer of the ancient art of war, has no support from any of the ancient authors fairly interpreted.  5 acquainted with the subject, may yet fail to give a complete transcript of the ideas of his original author. M. D'Alembert has favoured the public with some admirable translations from Tacitus; and it must be acknowledged, that he possessed every qualification requisite for the task he undertook. If, in the course of the following observations, I may have occasion to criticise any part of his writings, or those of other authors of equal celebrity, I avail myself of the just sentiment of M. Duclos, "On peut toujours relever les d efauts des grands hommes, et peut-etre sont ils les seuls qui en soient dignes, et dont la critique soit utile." ( Duclos, Pref. de l' Hist. de Louis XI. ) Germanicus, says: Pisonem interim apud Coum insulam nuncius adsequitur, excessisse Germanicum ; Tacit. An. lib. 2. c. 75. This passage is thus translated by M. D'Alembert, "Pison apprend, dans l'isle de Cos, la mort de Germanicus." In translating this passage, it is evident that M. D'Alembert has not given the complete sense of the original. The sense of Tacitus is, that Piso was overtaken on his voyage homeward, at the Isle of Cos, by a messenger, who informed him that Germanicus was dead. According to the French translator, we understand simply, that when Piso arrived at the Isle of Cos, he was informed that Germanicus was dead. We do not learn from this, that a messenger had followed him on his voyage to bring him this intelligence. The fact was, that Piso purposely lingered on his voyage homeward, expecting this very messenger who here overtook him. But, by M. D'Alembert's version it might be understood, that Germanicus had died in the island of Cos, and that Piso was informed of his death by the islanders immediately on his arrival. deliberated whether to proceed on his voyage to Rome, or to return immediately to Syria, and there put himself at the head of the legions. His son advised the former measure; but his friend Domitius Celer argued warmly for his return to the province, and urged, that all difficulties would give way to him, if he had once the command of the army, and had increased his force by new levies. At si teneat exercitum, augeat vires, multa qu ae provideri non possunt in melius casura , An. 1. 2. c. 77. This M. D'Alembert has translated, "Mais que s'il savoit se rendre redoutable a la tete des troupes, le hazard ameneroit des circonstances heureuses et imprevues." In the original passage, Domitius advises Piso to adopt two distinct measures; the first, to obtain the command of the army, and the second, to increase his force by new levies. These two distinct measures are confounded together by the translator, nor is the sense of either of them accurately given; for from the expression, "se rendre redoubtable a la tete des troupes," we may understand that Piso already had the command of the troops, and that all that was requisite, was to render himself formidable in that station, which he might do in various other ways than by increasing the levies. ascendency over all ranks in the state, says, C um caeteri nobilium, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur ; An. 1. I. c. 2. This D'Alembert has translated, "Le reste des nobles trouvoit dans les richesses et dans les honneurs la recompense de l'esclavage." Here the translator has but half expressed the meaning of his author, which is, that the rest of the nobility were exalted to riches and honours, in proportion as Augustus found in them an aptitude and disposition to servitude." vidissem, coramque gratias egissem, quod tibi L. Egnatius familiarissimus meus absens, L. Oppius praesens curoe fuisset. This passage is thus translated by Mr Melmoth: "If I were in Rome, I should have waited upon you for this purpose in person, and in order likewise to make my acknowledgements to you for your favours to my friends Egnatius and Oppius." Here the sense is not completely rendered, as there is an omission of the meaning of the words absens and pr aesens. can be given to the same passage or expression, (which, by the way, is always a defect in composition), the translator is called upon to exercise his judgement, and to select that meaning which is most consonant to the train of thought in the whole passage, or to the author's usual mode of thinking, and of expressing himself. To imitate the obscurity or ambiguity of the original is a fault; and it is still a greater, to give more than one meaning, as D'Alembert has done in the beginning of the Preface of Tacitus. The original runs thus: Urbem Romam a principio Reges habuere. Libertatem et consulatum L. Brutus instituit. Dictatur ae ad tempus sumebantur: neque Decemviralis potestas ultra biennium, neque Tribunorum militum consulare jus diu valuit . The ambiguous sentence is, Dictaturoe ad tempus sumebantur; which may signify either "Dictators were chosen for a limited time," or "Dictators were chosen on particular occasions or emergencies." D'Alembert saw this ambiguity; but how did he remove the difficulty? Not by exercising his judgement in determining between the two different meanings, but by giving them both in his translation. "On cr eoit au besoin des dictateurs passagers." Now, this double sense it was impossible that Tacitus should ever have intended to convey by the words ad tempus : and between the two meanings of which the words are susceptible, a very little critical judgement was requisite to decide. I know not that ad tempus is ever used in the sense of "for "the occasion, or emergency." If this had been the author's meaning, he would probably have used either the words ad occasionem , or pro re nata . But even allowing the phrase to be susceptible of this meaning,  6 , it is not the meaning which Tacitus chose to give it in this passage. That the author meant that the Dictator was created for a limited time, is, I think, evident from the sentence immediately following, which is connected by the copulative neque with the preceding: Dictatura ad tempus sumebantur: neque Decemviralis potestas ultra biennium valuit : "The office of Dictator was instituted for a limited time: nor did the power of the Decemvirs subsist beyond two years." M. D'Alembert's translation of the concluding sentence of this chapter is censurable on the same account. Tacitus says, Sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversa, claris scriptoribus memorata sunt; temporibusque Augusti dicendis non defuere decora ingenia, donec gliscente adulatione deterrerentur. Tiberii, Caiique, et Claudii, ac Neronis res, florentibus ipsis, ob metum fals ae: postquam occiderant, recentibus odiis compositae sunt. Inde consilium mibi pauca de Augusto, et extrema tradere: mox Tiberii principatum, et cetera, sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo . Thus translated by D'Alembert: "Des auteurs "illustres ont fait connoitre la gloire et les malheurs. de l'ancienne republique; l'histoire meme d'Auguste a ete ecrite par de grands genies, jusqu'aux tems ou la necessite de flatter les condamna au silence. La crainte menagea tant qu'ils vecurent, Tibere, Caius, Claude, et Neron; des qu'ils ne furent plus, la haine toute recente les dechira. J'ecrirai donc en peu de mots la fin du regne d'Auguste, puis celui de Tibere, et les suivans; sans fiel et sans bassesse: mon caractere m'en eloigne, et les tems m'en dispensent." In the last part of this passage, the translator has given two different meanings to the same clause, sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo , to which the author certainly meant to annex only one meaning; and that, as I think, a different one from either of those expressed by the translator. To be clearly understood, I must give my own version of the whole passage. The history of the ancient republic of Rome, both in its prosperous and in its adverse days, has been recorded by eminent authors: Even the reign of Augustus has been happily delineated, down to those times, when the prevailing spirit of adulation put to silence every ingenuous writer. The annals of Tiberius, of Caligula, of Claudius, and of Nero, written while they were alive, were falsified from terror; as were those histories composed after their death, from hatred to their recent memories. For this reason, I have resolved to attempt a short delineation of the latter part of the reign of Augustus; and afterwards that of Tiberius, and of the succeeding princes; conscious of perfect impartiality, as, from the remoteness of the events, I have no motive, either of odium or adulation." In the last clause of this sentence, I believe I have given the true version of sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo : But if this be the true meaning of the author, M. D'Alembert has given two different meanings to the same sentence, and neither of them the true one: sans fiel et sans bassesse: mon caractere m'en eloigne, et les tems m'en dispensent." According to the French translator, the historian pays a compliment first to his own character, and 2dly, to the character of the times; both of which he makes the pledges of his impartiality: but it is perfectly clear that Tacitus neither meant the one compliment nor the other; but intended simply to say, that the remoteness moteness of the events which he proposed to record, precluded every motive either of unfavourable prejudice or of adulation. Whether it is allowable for a translator to add to or retrench the ideas of the original ---Examples of the use and abuse of this liberty. the ideas of the original work, it becomes a question, whether it is allowable in any case to add to the ideas of the original what may appear to give greater force or illustration; or to take from them what may seem to weaken them from redundancy. To give a general answer to this question, I would say, that this liberty may be used, but with the greatest caution. It must be further observed, that the superadded idea shall have the most necessary connection with the original thought, and actually increase its force. And, on the other hand, that whenever an idea is cut off by the translator, it must be only such as is an accessory, and not a principal in the clause or sentence. It must likewise be confessedly redundant, so that its retrenchment shall not impair or weaken the original thought. Under these limitations, a translator may exercise his judgement, and assume to himself, in so far, the character of an original writer. IT will be allowed, that in the following instance the translator, the elegant Vincent Bourne , has added a very beautiful idea, which, while it has a most natural connection with the original thought, greatly heightens its energy and tenderness. The two following stanzas are a part of the fine ballad of Colin and Lucy , by Tickell. To-morrow in the church to wed, Impatient both prepare; But know, fond maid, and know, false man, That Lucy will be there. There bear my corse, ye comrades, bear, The bridegroom blithe to meet, He in his wedding-trim so gay, I in my winding-sheet. Thus translated by Bourne: Jungere cras dextrae dextram properatis uterque, Et tarde interea creditis ire diem. Credula quin virgo, juvenis quin perfide, uterque Scite, quod et pacti Lucia testis erit. Exangue, oh! illuc, comites, deferte cadaver, Qua semel, oh! iterum congrediamur, ait; Vestibus ornatus sponsalibus ille, caputque Ipsa sepulchrali vincta, pedesque stola. there is one most beautiful idea superadded by Bourne, in the line Qua semel, oh !  &c.; which wonderfully improves upon the original thought. In the original, the speaker, deeply impressed with the sense of her wrongs, has no other idea than to overwhelm her perjured lover with remorse at the moment of his approaching nuptials. In the translation, amidst this prevalent idea, the speaker all at once gives way to an involuntary burst of tenderness and affection, "Oh, let us "meet once more, and for the last time!" Semel, oh! iterum congrediamur, ait. \---It was only a man of exquisite feeling, who was capable of thus improving on so fine an original. syngrapham ad Imperatorem, non epistolam attulisses, sic pecunia ablat a domum redire properabas: nec tibi in mentem veniebat, cos ipsos qui cum syngraphis venissent Alexandriam, nullum adhuc nummum auferre potuisse . The passage is thus translated by Melmoth, b. 2. l. 12. "One would "have imagined indeed, you had carried a bill of exchange upon Caesar, instead of a letter of recommendation: As you seemed to think you had nothing more to do, than to receive your money, and to hasten home again. But money, my friend, is not so easily acquired; and I could name some of our acquaintance, who have been obliged to travel as far as Alexandria in pursuit of it, without having yet been able to obtain even their just demands." The expressions "money, my friend, is not so easily acquired," and "I could name some of our acquaintance," are not to be found in the original; but they have an obvious connection with the ideas of the original: they increase their force, while, at the same time, they give ease and spirit to the whole passage. I question much if a licence so unbounded as the following is justifiable, on the principle of giving either ease or spirit to the original. to him, ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/qugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἥ ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) . "You were always fond of a joke--- but where is the banquet? for I have brought you a new dithyrambic song, which I have lately learned." is thus translated; "Ah!

Hark ye, Timon, I've got a virgin-song for ye, just new composed, and smells of the gamut: 'Twill make your heart dance within you, old boy.

Add to this, the beauty which the picture acquires from this association of natural with moral effects. How inexcusable then must Mr Dryden appear, who, in his translation, has suppressed the Myrmidonumque dolos altogether.

Mr Pope, who has suppressed the epithet descriptive of the waist, has incurred on that account the censure of Mr Melmoth, who says, he has not touched the picture with that delicacy of pencil which graces the original, as he has entirely lost the beauty of one of the figures.---Though the hero and his son were designed to draw our principal attention, Homer intended likewise that we should cast a glance towards the nurse." Fitzosborne's Letters, l. 43\. If this was Homer's intention, he has, in my opinion, shewn less good taste in this instance, than his translator, who has, I think, with much propriety, left out the compliment to the nurse's waist altogether. And this liberty of the translator was perfectly allowable; for Homer's epithets are often nothing more than mere expletives, or additional designations of his persons. They are always, it is true, significant of some principal attribute of the person; but they are often applied by the poet in circumstances where the mention of that attribute is quite preposterous. It would shew very little judgement in a translator, who should honour Patroclus with the epithet of godlike , while he is blowing the fire to roast an ox; or bestow on Agamemnon the designation of King of many nations , while he is helping Ajax to a large piece of the chine. the English translators, had always been equally scrupulous in retrenching the ideas of his author. Cicero thus superscribes one of his letters: M. T. C. Terenti ae, et Pater suavissimae filiae Tulliolae, Ciccro matri et sorori S. D. (Ep. Fam. 1. I4. ep. I8.) And another in this manner: Tullius Terenti ae, et Pater Tulliolae, duabus animis suis, et Cicero Matri optimae, suavissimae sorori. (Lib. 14. ep. 14.) Why are these addresses entirely sunk in the translation, and a naked title poorly substituted for them, "To Terentia and Tullia," and "To the same?" The addresses to these letters give them their highest value, as they mark the warmth of the author's heart, and the strength of his conjugal and paternal affections. dixerit quum consuleret, quam cit o sestertium sexcenties impleturus esset, invenisse se exta duplicata, quibus portendi millies et ducenties habiturum , (Plin. Ep. 1. 2. ep. 20.) Thus translated by Melmoth, "That he once told me, upon consulting the omens, to know how soon he should be worth sixty millions of sesterces, he found them so favourable to him as to portend that he should possess double that sum." Here a material part of the original idea is omitted; no less than that very circumstance upon which the omen turned, viz. that the entrails of the victim were double. the original, is the liberty which a translator may take of correcting what appears to him a careless or inaccurate expression of the original, where that inaccuracy seems materially to affect the sense. Tacitus says, when Tiberius was entreated to take upon him the government of the empire, Ille vari e disserebat, de magnitudine imperii, sua modestia . An. 1. I. Here the word modestia is improperly applied. The author could not mean to say, that Tiberius discoursed to the people about his own modesty. He wished that his discourse should seem to proceed from modesty; but he did not talk to them about his modesty. D'Alembert saw this impropriety, and he has therefore well translated the passage: "Il r epondit par des discours generaux sur son peu de talent, et sur la grandeur de l'empire."

"I conceive it," says Sir John Denham, "a vulgar error in translating Poets, to affect being fidus interpres . Let that care be with them who deal in matters of fact or matters of faith; but whosoever aims at it in poetry, as he attempts what is not required, so shall he never perform what he attempts; for it is not his business alone to translate language into language, but poesie into poesie; and poesie is of so subtle a spirit, that in pouring out of one language into another, it will all evaporate; and if a new spirit is not added in the transfusion, there will remain nothing but a caput mortuum." Denham's Preface to the 2d book of Virgil's Æneid. part of the 17th century, seem to have had no other care than (in Denham's phrase) to translate language into language, and to have placed their whole merit in presenting a literal and servile transcript of their original. attention to the judicious precept of the very poem he was translating. Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus Interpres. Witness the following specimens, which will strongly illustrate Denham's judicious observations. \---Mortalia facta peribunt, Nedum sermonum stet honos et gratia vivax. Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere, cadentque Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus, Quem penes arbitrium est et vis et norma loquendi. \--- ---All mortal deeds Shall perish; so far off it is the state Or grace of speech should hope a lasting date. Much phrase that now is dead shall be reviv'd, And much shall die that now is nobly liv'd, If custom please, at whose disposing will The power and rule of speaking resteth still. Interdum tamen et vocem Comoedia tollit, Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore, Et Tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri. Telephus et Peleus, c um pauper et exul uterque, Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba, Si curat cor spectantis tetigisse querela. Ibid. Yet sometime doth the Comedy excite, Her voice, and angry Chremes chafes outright, With swelling throat, and oft the tragic wight Complains in humble phrase. Both Telephus And Peleus if they seek to heart-strike us That are spectators, with their misery, When they are poor and banish'd, must throw by Their bombard-phrase, and foot-and-half-foot words. Holiday, a writer of great learning, and even of critical acuteness, as the excellent commentary on his author fully shews.

Quid enim ratione timemus, Aut cupimus? quid tam dextro pede concipis, ut te Conat us non poeniteat, votique peracti. Evert ere domos totas optantibus ipsis Dii faciles.

May, in his translation of Lucan, and Sandys, in his Metamorphoses of Ovid, while they strictly adhered to the sense of their authors, and generally rendered line for line, have given to their versions both an ease of expression and a harmony of numbers, which approach them very near to original composition. The reason is, they have disdained to confine themselves to a literal interpretation; but have every where adapted their expression to the idiom of the language in which they wrote. There's no Alcyone! none, none! she died Together with her Ceÿx. Silent be All sounds of comfort. These, these eyes did see My shipwrack't Lord. I knew him; and my hands Thrust forth t'have held him: but no mortal bands Could force his stay. A ghost! yet manifest, My husband's ghost: which, Oh, but ill express'd His forme and beautie, late divinely rare! Now pale and naked, with yet dropping haire: Here stood the miserable! in this place: Here, here! (and sought his aerie steps to trace). Nulla est Alcyone, nulla est, ait: occidit una Cum Ceyce suo; solantia tollite verba: Nausragus interiit; vidi agnovique, manusque Ad discedentem, cupiens retinere, tetendi. Umbra fuit: sed et umbra tamen manifesta virique Vera mei: non ille quidem, si qu aeris, habebat Assuetos vultus, nec quo prius ore nitebat. Pallentem, nudumque, et adhuc humente capillo, Infelix vidi: stetit hoc miserabilis ipso, Ecce loco: (et qu aerit vestigia siqua supersint). peculiar felicity, "Silent be all sounds of comfort;" as are these words, Nec quo prius ore nitebat , "Which, oh! but ill express'd his forme and beautie." "No mortal bands could force his stay," has no strictly corresponding sentiment in the original. It is a happy amplification; which shews that Sandys knew what freedom was allowed to a poetical translator, and could avail himself of it. Metamorphoses of Ovid in I626, there does not appear to have been much improvement in the art of translating poetry till the age of Dryden: for though Sir John Denham has thought proper to pay a high compliment to Fanshaw on his translation of the Pastor Fido , terming him the inventor of "a new and nobler way" of translation, we find nothing in that performance which should intitle it to more praise than the Metamorphoses by Sandys and the Pharsalia by May.  7 emancipation from her fetters; and exulting in her new liberty, the danger now was, that she should run into the extreme of licentiousness. The followers of Dryden saw nothing so much to be emulated in his translations as the ease of his poetry: Fidelity was but a secondary object, and translation for a while was considered as synonymous with paraphrase. A judicious spirit of criticism was now wanting, to prescribe bounds to this increasing licence, and to determine to what precise degree a poetical translator might assume to himself the character of an original writer. In that design, Roscommon wrote his Essay on Translated Verse ; in which, in general, he has shewn great critical judgement; but proceeding, as all reformers, with rigour, he has, amidst many excellent precepts on the subject, laid down one rule, which every true poet (and such only should attempt to translate a poet) must consider as a very prejudicial restraint. After judiciously recommending to the translator, first to possess himself of the sense and meaning of his author, and then to imitate his manner and style, he th us prescribes a general rule, Your author always will the best advise; Fall when he falls, and when he rises, rise. duty of a poetical translator, never to suffer his original to fall. He must maintain with him a perpetual contest of genius; he must attend him in his highest flights, and soar, if he can, beyond him: and when he perceives, at any time, a diminution of his powers, when he sees a drooping wing, he must raise him on his own pinions. Homer has been judged by the best critics to fall at times beneath himself, and to offend, by introducing low images and puerile allusions. Yet how admirably is this defect veiled over, or altogether removed, by his translator Pope. In the beginning of the 8th book of the Iliad, Jupiter is introduced in great majesty, calling a council of the gods, and giving them a solemn charge to observe a strict neutrality between the Greeks and Trojans: ![](/images/inline/EEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ἴ ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sbAgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ἅ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) .

"Hear me, all ye'gods and goddesses, whilst I declare to you the dictates of my inmost heart. Let neither male nor female of the gods attempt to controvert what I shall say; but let all submissively assent, that I may speedily accomplish my undertakings: for whoever of you shall be found descending to give aid either to the Trojans or Greeks, shall return to Olympus sorely maimed, and in a disgraceful plight: or else I will seize him, and hurl him down to gloomy Tartarus, where there is a deep dungeon under the earth, with gates of iron, and a pavement of brass, as far below hell, as the earth is below the heavens. Then he will know how much stronger I am than all the other gods. But come now, and make trial, that ye may all be convinced. Suspend a golden chain from heaven, and hang all by one end of it, with your whole weight, gods and goddesses together: you will never pull down from the heaven to the earth, Jupiter, the supreme counsellor, though you should strain with your utmost force. But when I chuse to pull, I will raise you all, with the earth and sea together, and fastening the chain to the top of Olympus, will keep you all suspended at it. So much am I superior both to gods and men." thunderer; that the braggart vaunting in the beginning of it is nauseous; and that a mean and ludicrous picture is presented, by the whole groupe of gods and goddesses pulling at one end of a chain, and Jupiter at the other. To veil these defects in a translation was difficult; but to give any degree of dignity to this speech required certainly most uncommon powers. Yet I am much mistaken, if Mr Pope has not done so. I shall take the passage from the beginning: "Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn, Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn, When Jove conven'd the senate of the skies, Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise. The fire of Gods his awful silence broke, The heavens attentive, trembled as he spoke. "Celestial states, immortal gods! give ear; Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear; The fix'd decree, which not all heaven can move; Thou, fate! fulfil it; and, ye powers! approve! What God but enters yon forbidden field, Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield, Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven, Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of Heaven; "Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown, Low in the dark Tartarean gulph shall groan; With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors, And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors; As deep beneath th' infernal centre hurl'd, As from that centre to th' ethereal world. Let him who tempts me dread those dire abodes; And know th' Almighty is the God of Gods. League all your forces then, ye pow'rs above, Join all, and try th' omnipotence of Jove: Let down our golden everlasting chain, Whose strong embrace holds Heav'n, and Earth, and Main: "Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth, To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth: Ye strive in vain! If I but stretch this hand, I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land; I fix the chain to great Olympus' height, And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight! For such I reign, unbounded and above; And such are men and Gods, compar'd to Jove!" improved both upon the thought and expression of his original. We find frequently in Homer, amidst the most striking beauties, some circumstances introduced which diminish the merit of the thought or of the description. In such instances, the good taste of the translator invariably covers the defect of the original, and often converts it into an additional beauty. Thus, in the simile in the beginning of the 3d book, there is one circumstance which offends against good taste. ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Ngk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Pgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) & phgr;

How nobly is this picture raised and improved by Mr Pope! "As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night, O'er heav'n's clear azure spreads her sacred light: When not a breath disturbs the deep serene, And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene; Around her throne the vivid planets roll, And star's unnumber'd gild the glowing pole: O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed, And tip with silver every mountain's head: Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise, A flood of glory bursts from all the skies: The conscious swains rejoicing in the sight, Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light." improvement of his original, by a happy amplification and embellishment of his imagery, or by the judicious correction of defects; but to fix the precise degree to which this amplification, this embellishment, and this liberty of correction may extend, requires a great exertion of judgement. It may be useful to remark some instances of the want of this judgement. original author, what does not strictly accord with his characteristic mode of thinking, or expressing himself.

The burning zone, the frozen isles, Shall hear me sing of Celia's smiles; All cold, but in her breast, I will despise, And dare all heat, but that in Celia's eyes. addition of these is quite unjustifiable, as they belong to a quaint species of wit, of which the writings of Horace afford no example.

"Some block "the narrow streets." Even this is a faulty translation of obsidere alii telis angusta viarum ; but it fails on the score of mutilation, not redundancy. The rest of the ideas which compose these four lines, are the original property of the translator; and the antithetical witticism in the concluding line, is far beneath the chaste simplicity of Virgil. on the same account: ![](/images/inline/Lgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/etigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) Iliad, 6. 327. For thee great Ilion's guardian heroes fall, Till heaps of dead alone defend the wall. sole merit. The original, with grave simplicity, declares, that the people fell, fighting before the town, and around the walls.  10 rule of translation, viz. that which enjoins a complete transfusion of the ideas and sentiments of the original work, have likewise a near connection with the second general rule, which I shall now proceed to consider. Second General Rule: The Style and Manner of writing in a Translation should be of the same Character with that of the Original.---A just Taste requisite for the discernment of the Characters of Style and Manner.---Examples of failure in this particular;---The grave exchanged for the formal;---The elevated for the bombast;---The lively for the petulant;--- The simple for the childish.---Hobbes, L'Estrange, Echard, &c. an author, is an assimilation of the style and manner of writing in the translation to that of the original. A translator, therefore, must apply his attention to discover the true character of his author's style. He must ascertain with precision to what class it belongs; whether to that of the grave, the elevated, the easy, the lively, the florid and ornamented, or the simple and unaffected; and these characteristic qualities must be equally conspicuous in the translation as in the original. If a translator wants this discernment, let him be ever so thoroughly master of the sense of his author, he will present him through a distorting medium, or exhibit him often in a garb that is unsuitable to his character. Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto. Which the Abb e des Fontaines thus translates: "A peine un petit nombre de ceux qui montoient le vaisseau purent se sauver a la nage." Of this translation Voltaire justly remarks, "C'est traduire Virgile en style de gazette. Ou est ce vaste gouffre que peint le poete, gurgite vasto ? O u est l' apparent rari nantes ? Ce n'est pas ainsi qu'on doit traduire l'Eneide." Voltaire, Quest. sur l' Encyclop. mot Amplification. Evening Post or the Daily Advertiser, what must we think of the translator, who makes the solemn and sententious Tacitus express himself in the low cant of the streets, or in the dialect of the waiters of a tavern? Facile Asinium et Messalam inter Antonium et Augustum bellorum proemiis refertos : Thus translated in a version of Tacitus by Mr Dryden and several eminent hands: "Asinius and Messala, who feathered their nests well in the civil wars 'twixt Antony and Augustus." Vinolentiam et libidines usurpans : "Playing the good-fellow." Frustra Arminium pr aescribi : "Trumping up Arminius's title." Sed Agrippina libertam aemulam, nurum ancillam, aliaque eundem in modum muliebriter fremere : "But Agrippina could not bear that a freedwoman should nose her." And another translator says, "But Agrippina could not bear that a freedwoman should beard her." Of a similar character with this translation of Tacitus is a translation of Suetonius by several gentlemen of Oxford  11 , which abounds with such elegancies as the following: Sestio Gallo, libidinoso et prodigo seni : "Sestius Gallus, a most notorious old Sir Jolly."

Unless he is possessed of the most correct taste, he will be in continual danger of presenting an exaggerated picture or a caricatura of his original. The distinction between good and bad writing is often of so very slender a nature, and the shadowing of difference so extremely delicate, that a very nice perception alone can at all times define the limits. Thus in the hands of some translators, who have discernment to perceive the general character of their author's style, but want this correctness of taste, the grave style of the original becomes heavy and formal in the translation; the elevated swells into bombast, the lively froths up into the petulant, and the simple and naif degenerates into the childish and insipid. striking picture of the miseries of his country, on the supposition that success had crowned the designs of the conspirators, closes the detail with this grave and solemn application: Quia mihi vehementer h aec videntur misera atque miseranda, idcirca in eos qui ea perficere voluerunt, me severum, vehementemque praebeo. Etenim quaero, si quis paterfamilias, liberis suis a servo interfectis, uxore occisa, incensa domo, supplicium de servo quam acerbissimum sumserit; utrum is clemens ac misericors, an inhumanissimus et crudelissimus esse videatur? Mihi vero importunus ac ferreus, qui non dolore ac cruciatu nocentis, suum dolorem ac cruciatum lenierit. following heavy, formal, and insipid version. " Now as to me these calamities appear extremely shocking and deplorable; therefore I am extremely keen and rigorous in punishing those who endeavoured to bring them about. For let me put the case, that a master of a family had his children butchered, his wife murdered, his house burnt down by a slave, yet did not inflict the most rigorous of punishments imaginable upon that slave: would such a master appear merciful and compassionate, and not rather a monster of cruelty and inhumanity? To me that man would appear to be of a flinty cruel nature, who should not endeavour to soothe his own anguish and torment by the anguish and torment of its guilty cause  12 ."

When all was wrapt in dark midnight, And all were fast asleep, In glided Margaret's grimly ghost, And stood at William's feet. Her face was like the April morn, Clad in a wintry cloud; And clay-cold was her lily hand, That held her sable shrowd. So shall the fairest face appear, When youth and years are flown; Such is the robe that Kings must wear, When Death has rest their crown. Her bloom was like the springing flower, That sips the silver dew; The rose was budded in her cheek, And opening to the view. But Love had, like the canker-worm, Consum'd her early prime; The rose grew pale and left her cheek, She died before her time. Omnia nox tenebris, tacit aque involverat umbra, Et fessos bomines vinxerat alta quies; C um valvae patuere, et gressu illapsa silenti, Thyrsidis ad lectum stabat imago Chloes. Vultus erat, qualis lachrymosi vultus Aprilis, Cui dubia hyberno conditur imbre dies; Quaque sepulchralem a pedibus collegit amictum, Candidior nivibus, frigidiorque manus. C umque dies aberunt molles, et loeta juventus, Gloria pallebit, sic Cyparissi tua ; C um mors decutiet capiti diademata, regum H ac erit in trabea conspiciendus honos. Forma fuit (dum forma fuit) nascentis ad instar Floris, cui cano gemmula rore tumet; Et Veneres risere, et subrubuere labella, Subrubet ut teneris purpura prima rosis. Sed lenta exedit tabes mollemque ruborem, Et faciles risus, et juvenile decus; Et rosa paulatim languens, nudata reliquit Oscula; proeripuit mors properata Chloen. likewise translated into Latin by Bourne. Behind her neck her comely tresses tied, Her ivory quiver graceful by her side, A-hunting Chloe went; she lost her way, And through the woods uncertain chanc'd to stray. Apollo passing by beheld the maid; And, sister dear, bright Cynthia, turn, he said; The hunted hind lies close in yonder brake. Loud Cupid laugh'd, to see the God's mistake: And laughing cried, learn better, great Divine, To know thy kindred, and to honour mine. Rightly advis'd, far hence thy sister seek, Or on Meander's banks, or Latmus' peak. But in this nymph, my friend, my sister know; She draws my arrows, and she bends my bow. Fair Thames she haunts, and every neighbouring grove, Sacred to soft recess, and gentle Love. Go with thy Cynthia, hurl the pointed spear At the rough boar, or chace the flying deer: I, and my Chloe, take a nobler aim; At human hearts we fling, nor ever miss the game. Forte Chloe, pulchros nodo collecta capillos Post collum, pharetr aque latus succincta decora, Venatrix ad sylvam ibat; cervumque secuta Elapsum visu, deserta per avia tendit Incerta. Errantem nympham conspexit Apollo, Et, converte tuos, dixit, mea Cynthia, cursus; En ibi (monstravitque manu) tibi cervus anhelat Occultus dumo, latebrisque moratur in illis. Improbus hoec audivit amor, lepidumque cachinnum Attollens, poterantne etiam tua numina falli? Hinc, quoeso, bone Phoebe, tuam dignosce sororem, Et melius venerare meam.

Ite per umbrosos saltus, lustrisque vel aprum Excutite horrentem setis, cervumve fugacem, Tuque sororque tua, et directo sternite ferro: Nobilior labor, et divis dignissima cura, Meque Chloenque manet; nos corda humana ferimus, Vibrantes certum vulnus nec inutile telum. dialogue with Lydia: Plus heureux qu'un monarque au faite des grandeurs, J'ai vu mes jours dignes d'envie, Tranquiles, ils couloient au gre de nos ardeurs: Vous m'aimiez, charmante Lydie. Que mes jours etoient beaux, quand des soins lesplus doux Vous payiez ma flamme sincere! Venus me regardoit avec des yeux jaloux; Chloe n'avoit pas sçu vous plaire. Par son luth, par sa voix, organe des amours, Chloe seule me paroit belle: Si le Destin jaloux veut epargner ses jours, Je donnerai les miens pour elle. Le jeune Calais, plus beau que les amours, Plait seul a mon ame ravie: Si le Destin jaloux veut epargner ses jours, Je donnerai deux fois ma vie. Quoi, si mes premiers feux, ranimant leur ardeur, Etouffoient une amour fatale; Si, perdant pour jamais tous ses droits sur mon coeur, Chloe vous laissoit sans rivale--- Calais est charmant: mais je n'aime que vous, Ingrat, mon coeur vous justifie; Heureuse egalement en des liens si doux, De perdre ou de passer la vie  14 . stanza, which does not convey the happy petulance, the procacitas of the original.

I confess Man is the child of sorrow, and this world, In which we breathe, hath cares enough to plague us; But it hath means withal to soothe these cares; And he who meditates on others woes, Shall in that meditation lose his own: Call then the tragic poet to your aid, Hear him, and take instruction from the stage: Let Telephus appear; behold a prince, A spectacle of poverty and pain, Wretched in both.---And what if you are poor? Are you a demigod? Are you the son Of Hercules? Begone! Complain no more. Doth your mind struggle with distracting thoughts? Do your wits wander? Are you mad? Alas! So was Alcmaeon, whilst the world ador'd His father as their God. Your eyes are dim; What then? The eyes of OEdipus were dark, Totally dark. You mourn a son; he's dead; Turn to the tale of Niobe for comfort, And match your loss with hers. You're lame of foot; Compare it with the foot of Philoctetes, And make no more complaint. But you are old, Old and unfortunate; consult Oeneus; Hear what a king endur'd, and learn content. Sum up your miseries, number up your sighs, The tragic stage shall give you tear for tear, And wash out all afflictions but its own  17 spirit of the dialogue, in what has been termed the New Comedy of the Greeks, or that which was posterior to the age of Alexander the Great. Of this period Diphilus and Menander were among the most shining ornaments. We have a notable good law at Corinth, Where, if an idle fellow outruns reason, Feasting and junketting at furious cost, The sumptuary proctor calls upon him, And thus begins to sift him.---You live well, But have you well to live? You squander freely, Have you the wherewithal? Have you the fund For these outgoings? If you have, go on! If you have not, we'll stop you in good time, Before you outrun honesty; for he Who lives we know not how, must live by plunder; Either he picks a purse, or robs a house, Or is accomplice with some knavish gang, Or thrusts himself in crowds, to play th'informer, And put his perjur'd evidence to sale: This a well-order'd city will not suffer; Such vermin we expell.-----"And you do wisely: "But what is that to me?"---Why, this it is: Here we behold you every day at work, Living, forfooth! not as your neighbours live, But richly, royally, ye gods!---Why man, We cannot get a fish for love or money, You swallow the whole produce of the sea: You've driv'n our citizens to brouze on cabbage; A sprig of parsley sets them all a-fighting, As at the Isthmian games: If hare or partridge, Or but a simple thrush comes to the market, Quick, at a word, you snap him: By the gods! Hunt Athens through, you shall not find a feather But in your kitchen; and for wine, 'tis gold--- Not to be purchas'd.---We may drink the ditches  18 those translations given by Mr. Cumberland, of the fragments of the Greek dramatists. The literary world owes to that ingenious writer a very high obligation, for his excellent view of the progress of the dramatic art among the Greeks, and for the collection he has made of the remains of more than fifty of their comic poets  19 .

In Britanniam te profectum non esse gaudeo, quod et tu labore caruisti, et ego te de rebus illis non audiam. the same time do complete justice to the sentiment. Melmoth, therefore, has shown great judgement, in sacrificing the imitation of style to the perfect transfusion of the sense. "I am glad for my sake, as well as yours, that you did not attend C aesar into Britain; as it has not only saved you the fatigue of a very disagreeable journey, but me likewise that of being the perpetual auditor of your wonderful exploits." Melm. Cic. Lett. b. 2\. l. 12. Temer e dixi---Succurrit quod proeterieram, et quidcm sero: sed quanquam prepostere reddetur. Facit hoc Homerus, multique illius exemplo. Est alioqui perdecorum: a me tamen non ideo fiet . It is no doubt possible to translate this passage into English with a conciseness almost equal to the original. But in this experiment we must sacrifice all its ease and spirit. "I have said this rashly---I recollect an omission--- somewhat too late indeed. It shall now be supplied, though a little preposterously. Homer does this: and many after his example. Besides, it is not unbecoming; but this is not my reason." Let us mark how Mr Melmoth, by a happy amplification, has preserved the spirit and ease, though sacrificing the brevity of the original. "But upon recollection, I find that I must recall that last word; for I perceive, a little too late indeed, that I have omitted a material circumstance. However, I will mention it here, though something out of its place. In this, I have the authority of Homer, and several other great names, to keep me in countenance; and the critics will tell you this irregular manner has its beauties: but, upon my word, it is a beauty I had not at all in my view." imitation in English, occurs in another letter of Cicero to Trebatius, Ep. l. 7\. 14. Chrysippus Vettius, Cyri architecti libertus, fecit, ut te non immemorem putarem mei. Valde jam lautus es qui gravere literas ad me dare, homini proesertim domestico. Quod si scribere oblitus es, minus multi jam te advocato caus a cadent. Sin nostri oblitus es, dabo operam ut islhuc veniam antequam plane ex animo tuo essluo. attempting to imitate the brevity of the original, which he knew to be impossible, he saw that the characterising features of the passage were ease and vivacity; and these he has very happily transfused into his translation. " If it were not for the compliments you sent me by Chrysippus, the freedman of Cyrus the architect, I should have imagined I no longer possessed a place in your thoughts. But surely you are become a most intolerable fine gentleman, that you could not bear the fatigue of writing to me, when you had the opportunity of doing so by a man, whom, you know, I look upon as one almost of my own family. Perhaps, however, you may have forgotten the use of your pen: and so much the better, let me tell you, for your clients, as they will lose no more causes by its blunders. But if it is myself only that has escaped your remembrance, I must endeavour to refresh it by a visit, before I am worn out of your memory, beyond all power of recollection." to that of the Latin: and of this D'Alembert has given many happy examples in his translations from Tacitus. Quod si vita suppeditet, principatum divi Nervoe et imperium Trajani, uberiorem, securioremque materiam senectuti seposui: rar a temporum felicitate, ubi sentire quoe velis, et quoe sentias dicere licet , Praef. ad Hist." "Si les dieux m'accordent des jours, je destine a l' occupation et a la consolation de ma vieillesse, l'histoire interessante et tranquille de Nerva et de Trajan; tems heureux et rares, ou l'on est libre de penser et de parler." translated by Rousseau: "Que s'il me reste assez de vie, je reserve pour ma vieillesse la riche et paisible matiere des regnes de Nerva et de Trajan: rares et heureux tems, o u l'on peut penser librement, et dire ce que l'on pense." his original, has sometimes left the sense imperfect. Of this an example occurs in the passage before quoted, An. l. 1. c. 2. Cum coeteri nobilium, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur : the translator, too studious of brevity, has not given the complete idea of his author, "Le reste des nobles trouvoit dans les richesses et dans les honneurs la r ecompense de l'esclavage."

" For nine days the arrows of the god were darted through the camp." The elliptical brevity of Mr Macpherson's translation of this verse, has no parallel in the original; nor is it agreeable to the English idiom: "Nine days rush the shafts of the God." Whether a Poem can be well translated into Prose. may derive this precept, That a translator ought always to figure to himself, in what manner the original author would have expressed himself, if he had written in the language of the translation. question which has admitted of some dispute, Whether a poem can be well translated into prose? the sweetness and melody of the versification. Of these it is evident, that the very essence must perish in translating them into prose. But a great deal of the beauty of every regular poem, consists in the melody of its numbers. Sensible of this truth, many of the prose translators of poetry, have attempted to give a sort of measure to their prose, which removes it from the nature of ordinary language. If this measure is uniform, and its return regular, the composition is no longer prose, but blank-verse. If it is not uniform, and does not regularly return upon the ear, the composition will be more unharmonious, than if the measure had been entirely neglected. Of this, Mr Macpherson's translation of the Iliad is a strong example. prose. It is by the character of its thoughts and sentiments, and by the nature of that language in which they are clothed. A boldness of figures, a luxuriancy of imagery, a frequent use of metaphors, a quickness of transition, a liberty of digressing; all these are not only allowable in poetry, but to many species of it, essential . But they are quite unsuitable to the character of prose. When seen in a prose translation , they appear preposterous and out of place, because they are never found in an original prose composition. of poems originally composed in prose, as Fenelon's Telemachus. But to this we answer, that Fenelon, in composing his Telemachus, has judiciously adopted nothing more of the characteristics of poetry, than what might safely be given to a prose composition. His good taste prescribed to him certain limits, which he was under no necessity of transgressing. But a translator is not left to a similar freedom of judgement: he must follow the footsteps of his original. Fenelon's Epic Poem is of a very different character from the Iliad, the  Æneid, or the Gierusalemme Liberata . The French author has, in the conduct of his fable, seldom transgressed the bounds of historic probability; he has sparingly indulged himself in the use of the Epic machinery; and there is a chastity and sobriety even in his language, very different from the glowing enthusiasm that characterises the diction of the poems we have mentioned: We find nothing in the Telemaque of the Os magna sonaturum. degree, according to the nature or species of the poem. Didactic poetry, of which the principal merit consists in the detail of a regular system, or in rational precepts which flow from each other in a connected train of thought, will evidently suffer least by being transfused into prose. But every didactic poet judiciously enriches his work with such ornaments as are not strictly attached to his subject. In a prose translation of such a poem, all that is strictly systematic or preceptive may be transfused with propriety; all the rest, which belongs to embellishment, will be found impertinent and out of place. found impossible to convey the smallest idea in a prose translation. Such is Lyric poetry, where a greater degree of irregularity of thought, and a more unrestrained exuberance of fancy, is allowable than in any other species of composition. To attempt, therefore, a translation of a lyric poem into prose, is the most absurd of all undertakings; for those very characters of the original which are essential to it, and which constitute its highest beauties, if transferred to a prose translation, become unpardonable blemishes. The excursive range of the sentiments, and the play of fancy, which we admire in the original, degenerate in the translation into mere raving and impertinence. impossible to do complete justice to any species of poetical composition in a prose translation; in other words, that none but a poet can translate a poet. Third General Rule---A Translation should have all the Ease of Original Composition. ---Extreme difficulty in the observance of this Rule.--- Contrasted Instances of Success and Failure. transfused as to produce its full effect, it is necessary, not only that the translation should contain a perfect transcript of the sentiments of the original, and present likewise a resemblance of its style and manner; but, That the translation should have all the ease of original composition. necessarily confined, with regard to the sentiments and manner of his original, it will soon appear that this last requisite includes the most difficult part of his task  20 To one who walks in trammels, it is not easy to exhibit an air of grace and freedom. It is difficult, even for a capital painter, to preserve in a copy of a picture all the ease and spirit of the original; yet the painter employs precisely the same colours, and has no other care than faithfully to imitate the touch and manner of the picture that is before him: if the original is easy and graceful, the copy will have the same qualities, in proportion as the imitation is just and perfect. The translator's task is very different: He uses not the same colours with the original, but is required to give his picture the same force and effect. He is not allowed to copy the touches of the original, yet is required, by touches of his own, to produce a perfect resemblance. The more he studies a scrupulous imitation, the less his copy will reflect the ease and spirit of the original. How then shall a translator accomplish this difficult union of ease with fidelity? To use a bold expression, he must adopt the very soul of his author, which must speak through his own organs. the attainment of ease of style, by instances both of success and failure. in original composition. It consists in a delicate medium between the perfect freedom of ordinary conversation and the regularity of written dissertation or narrative. It is extremely difficult to attain this delicate medium in a translation; because the writer has neither a freedom of choice in the sentiments, nor in the mode of expressing them. Mr Melmoth appears to me to be a great model in this respect. His Translations of the Epistles of Cicero and of Pliny have all the ease of the originals, while they present in general a very faithful transcript of his author's sense. "Surely, my friend , your couriers are a set of the most unconscionable fellows. Not that they have given me any particular offence; but as they never bring me a letter when they arrive here, is it fair , they should always press me for one when they return?" Melmoth, Cic. Ep. 10\. 20. Proeposteros habes tabellarios; etsi me quidem non offendunt. Sed tamen cum a me discedunt, flagitant litteras, cum ad me veniunt, nullas afferunt. Cic. Ep. l. 15. ep. 17. "Is it not more worthy of your mighty ambition, to be blended with your learned brethren at Rome, than to stand the sole great wonder of wisdom amidst a parcel of paltry provincials ?" Melmoth, Cic. Ep. 2. 23. Velim---ibi malis esse ubi aliquo numero sis, quam isthic ubi solus sapere videare , Cic. Epist. l. 1. ep. IO. " In short , I plainly perceive your finances are in no flourishing situation, and I expect to hear the same account of all your neighbours; so that famine, my friend, most formidable famine , must be your fate , if you do not provide against it in due time. And since you have been reduced to sell your horse, e'en mount your mule, (the only animal, it seems , belonging to you, which you have not yet sacrificed to your table ), and convey yourself immediately to Rome. To encourage you to do so , you shall be honoured with a chair and cushion next to mine, and sit the second great pedagogue in my celebrated school." Melmoth, Cic. Ep. 8\. 22. Video te bona perdidisse: spero idem isthuc familiares tuos. Actum igitur de te est, nisi provides. Potes mulo isto quem tibi reliquum dicis esse (quando cantherium comedisti) Romam pervehi. Sella tibi erit in ludo, tanquam hypodidascalo; proxima eam pulvinus sequetur. Cic. Ep. l. 9. Ep. 18. " Are you not a pleasant mortal , to question me concerning the fate of those estates you mention, when Balbus had just before been paying you a visit ?" Melmoth, Cic. Ep. 8. 24. Non tu homo ridiculus es, qui cum Balbus noster apud te fuerit, ex me quoeras quid de istis municipiis et agris futurum putem ? Cic. Ep. 9. I7. " And now I have raised your expectations of this piece, I doubt you will be disappointed when it comes to your hands . In the meanwhile, however, you may expect it, as something that will please you: And who knows but it may ?" Plin. Ep. 8. 3. Erexi expectationem tuam; quam vereor ne destituat oratio in manus sumpta. Interim tamen, tanquam placituram, et fortasse placebit, expecta. Plin. Ep. 8. 3. "I consent to undertake the cause which you so earnestly recommend to me; but as glorious and honourable as it may be, I will not be your counsel without a fee . Is it possible, you will say, that my friend Pliny should be so mercenary? In truth it is ; and I insist upon a reward, which will do me more honour than the most disinterested patronage." Plin. Ep. 6\. 23. Impense petis ut agam causam pertinentem ad curam tuam, pulchram alioquin et famosam. Faciam, sed non gratis. Qui fieri potest (inquis) ut non gratis tu? Potest: exigam enim mercedem honestiorem gratuito patrocinio. Plin. Ep. 8. 3. To these examples of the ease of epistolary correspondence, I add a passage from one of the orations of Cicero, which is yet in a strain of greater familiarity: "A certain mechanic--- What's his name?---Oh, I'm obliged to you for helping me to it : Yes, I mean Polycletus." Melmoth. Artificem---quemnam? Recte admones. Polycletum esse ducebant. Cicero, Orat. 2. in Verrem. translation which are marked in Italics, are those which, in my opinion, give it the ease of original composition. ease of the original, the most correct taste is requisite to prevent that ease from degenerating into licentiousness. I have given some examples of the want of this taste in treating of the imitation of style and manner. The most licentious of all translators was Mr Thomas Brown, of facetious memory, in whose translations from Lucian we have the most perfect ease; but it is the ease of Billingsgate and of Wapping. I shall contrast a few passages of his translation of this author, with those of another translator, who has given a faithful transcript of the sense of his author, but from an over-scrupulous fidelity has failed a little in point of ease. O me, O me! But I will call you into the Areopagus for this. Timon , Stay a little only, and you may bring me in guilty of murder  21 ." Franklin's Lucian. for, old Touchwood? Bear witness, Hercules, that he has struck me. I warrant you, I shall make you repent of this blow. I'll indite you upon an action of the case, and bring you coram nobis for an assault and battery." Timon . "Do, thou confounded lawpimp, do; but if thou stay'st one minute longer, I'll beat thee to pap. I'll make thy bones rattle in thee, like three blue beans in a blue bladder. Go, stinkard, or else I shall make you alter your action, and get me indicted for manslaughter." Timon Trans! by Brown, in Dryd en's Lucian. " On the whole, a most perfect character; we shall see presently, with all his modesty, what a bawling he will make." Franklin's Lucian, Timon 22 "In fine, he's a person that knows the world better than any one, and is extremely well acquainted with the whole Encyclopoedia of villany; a true elaborate finished rascal, and for all, he "appears so demure now, that you'd think butter would not melt in his mouth; yet I shall soon make him open his pipes, and roar like a persecuted bear." Dryden's Lucian, Timon. " He changes his name, and instead of Byrria, Dromo, or Tibius, now takes the name of Megacles, or Megabyzus, or Protarchus, leaving the rest of the expectants gaping and looking at one another in silent sorrow." Franklin's Lucian, Timon 23 . " Straight he changes his name, so that the rascal, who the moment before had no other title about the house, but, you son of a whore, you bulk-begotten cur, you scoundrel, must now be called his worship, his excellency, and the Lord knows what. The best on't is, that this mushroom puts all these fellows noses out of joint,"  &c. Dryden's Lucian, Timon. Lucian fails perhaps as much on the score of restraint, as the other on that of licentiousness. The preceding examples from Melmoth point out, in my opinion, the just medium of free and spirited translation, for the attainment of which the most correct taste is requisite. It is less difficult to attain the ease of original composition in Poetical, than in Prose translation.---Lyric poctry admits of the greatest liberty of translation.---Examples distinguishing Paraphrase from Translation, ---from Dryden, Lowth, Hughes. give to a poetical translation all the ease of original composition, than to give the same degree of ease to a prose translation. Yet the truth of this assertion will be readily admitted, if assent is given to that observation, which I before endeavoured to illustrate, viz. That a superior degree of liberty is allowed to a poetical translator in amplifying, retrenching from, and embellishing his original, than to a prose translator. For without some portion of this liberty, there can be no ease of composition; and where the greatest liberty is allowable, there that ease will be most apparent, as it is less difficult to attain to it. the lyric is that which allows of the greatest liberty in translation; as a freedom both of thought and expression is agreeable to its character. Yet even in this, which is the freest of all species of translation, we must guard against licentiousness; and perhaps the more so, that we are apt to persuade ourselves that the less caution is necessary. The difficulty indeed is, where so much freedom is allowed, to define what is to be accounted licentiousness in poetical translation. A moderate liberty of amplifying and retrenching the ideas of the original, has been granted to the translator of prose; but is it allowable, even to the translator of a lyric poem, to add new images and new thoughts to those of the original, or to enforce the sentiments by illustrations which are not in the original? As the limits between free translation and paraphrase are more easily perceived than they can be well defined, instead of giving a general answer to this question, I think it safer to give my opinion upon particular examples. countrymen, a very noble imitation of the 6th ode of the 3d book of Horace: Delicta majorum immeritus lues ,  &c. The greatest part of this composition is of the nature of parody; but in the version of the following stanza there is perhaps but a slight excess of that liberty which may be allowed to the translator of a lyric poet: Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos Matura virgo, et fingitur artubus Jam nunc, et incestos amores De tenero meditatur ungui. The ripening maid is vers'd in every dangerous art, That ill adorns the form, while it corrupts the heart; Practis'd to dress, to dance, to play, In wanton mask to lead the way, To move the pliant limbs, to roll the luring eye; With Folly's gayest partizans to vie In empty noise and vain expence; To celebrate with flaunting air The midnight revels of the fair; Studious of every praise, but virtue, truth, and sense. has, in two parts of the stanza, given a moral application which is not in the original: "That ill adorns the form, while it corrupts the heart;" and "Studious of every praise, but virtue, truth, and sense." These moral lines are unquestionably a very high improvement of the original; but they seem to me to transgress, though indeed very slightly, the liberty allowed to a poetical translator. Horace, which upon the whole is paraphrastical, the version of the two following stanzas has no more licence than what is justifiable: Fortuna soevo loeta negotio, et Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax, Transmutat incertos honores, Nunc mihi, nunc alii benigna. Laudo manentem: si celeres quatit Pennas, resigno quoe dedit: et mea Virtute me involvo, probamque Pauperiem sine dote quoero. Fortune, who with malicious joy Does man, her slave, oppress, Proud of her office to destroy, Is seldom pleas'd to bless. Still various, and inconstant still, But with an inclination to be ill, Promotes, degrades, delights in strife, And makes a lottery of life. I can enjoy her while she's kind; But when she dances in the wind, And shakes her wings, and will not stay, I puff the prostitute away: The little or the much she gave is quietly resign'd; Content with poverty, my soul I arm, And Virtue, though in rags, will keep me warm. imitation of the 16th ode of the 2d book of Horace, the greatest part of the composition is a just and excellent translation, while the rest is a free paraphrase or commentary on the original. I shall mark in Italics, all that I consider as paraphrastical: the rest is a just translation, in which the writer has assumed no more liberty, than was necessary to give the poem the easy air of an original composition. Indulgent Quiet! Pow'r serene, Mother of Peace, and Joy, and Love, O say, thou calm, propitious Queen, Say, in what solitary grove, Within what hollow rock, or winding cell, By human eyes unseen, Like some retreated Druid dost thou dwell? And why, illusive Goddess! why, When we thy mansion would surround, Why dost thou lead us through enchanted ground, To mock our vain research, and from our wishes fly ? The wand'ring sailors, pale with fear, For thee the gods implore, When the tempestuous sea runs high, And when through all the dark, benighted sky, No friendly moon or stars appear, To guide their steerage to the shore: For thee the weary soldier prays, Furious in fight the sons of Thrace, And Medes, that wear majestic by their side A full-charg'd quiver's decent pride, Gladly with thee would pass inglorious days, Renounce the warrior's tempting praise, And buy thee, if thou might'st be sold, With gems, and purple vests, and stores of plunder'd gold. But neither boundless wealth, nor guards that wait Around the Consul's honour'd gate, Nor antichambers with attendants fill'd, The mind's unhappy tumults can abate, Or banish sullen cares, that fly Across the gilded rooms of state, And their foul nests like swallows build Close to the palace-roofs and tow'rs that pierce the sky ? Much less will Nature's modest wants supply: And happier lives the homely swain, Who in some cottage, far from noise, His few paternal goods enjoys; Nor knows the sordid lust of gain, Nor with Fear's tormenting pain His hovering sleeps destroys. Vain man! that in a narrow space At endless game projects the daring spear! For short is life's uncertain race; Then why, capricious mortal! why Dost thou for happiness repair To distant climates and a foreign air? Fool! from thyself thou canst not fly, Thyself the source of all thy care: So flies the wounded stag, provok'd with pain, Bounds o'er the spacious downs in vain; The feather'd torment sticks within his side, And from the smarting wound a purple tide Marks all his way with blood, and dies the grassy plain. But swifter far is execrable Care Than stags, or winds, that through the skies Thick-driving snows and gather'd tempests bear; Pursuing Care the sailing ship out-flies, Climbs the tall vessel's painted sides; Nor leaves arm'd squadrons in the field, But with the marching horseman rides, And dwells alike in courts and camps, and makes all places yield. Then, since no state's completely blest, Let's learn the bitter to allay With gentle mirth, and wisely gay, Enjoy at least the present day, And leave to Fate the rest. Nor with vain fear of ills to come Anticipate th' appointed doom. Soon did Achilles quit the stage; The hero fell by sudden death; While Tithon to a tedious, wasting age Drew his protracted breath. And thus, old partial Time, my friend, Perhaps unask'd, to worthless me Those hours of lengthen'd life may lend, Which he'll refuse to thee. Thee shining wealth, and plenteous joys surround, And all thy fruitful fields around Unnumber'd herds of cattle stray; Thy harness'd steeds with sprightly voice, Make neighbouring vales and hills rejoice, While smoothly the gay chariot flies o'er the swiftmeasur'd way. To me the stars with less profusion kind, An humble fortune have assign'd, And no untuneful Lyric vein, But a sincere contented mind That can the vile, malignant crowd disdain  24 Of the translation of idiomatic phrases.--- Examples from Cotton, Eachard, Sterne. ---Injudicious use of idioms in the translation, which do not correspond with the age or country of the original.---Idiomatic phrases sometimes incapable of translation. composition, the chief difficulty he has to encounter will be found in the translation of idioms, or those turns of expression which do not belong to universal grammar, but of which every language has its own, that are exclusively proper to it. It will be easily understood, that when I speak of the difficulty of translating idioms, I do not mean those general modes of arrangement or construction which regulate a whole language, and which may not be common to it with other tongues: As, for example, the placing the adjective always before the substantive in English, which in French and in Latin is most commonly placed after it; the use of the participle in English, where the present tense is used in other languages; as he is writing, scribit, il ecrit ; the use of the preposition to before the infinitive in English, where the French use the preposition de or of . These, which may be termed the general idioms of a language, are soon understood, and are exchanged for parallel idioms with the utmost ease. With regard to these a translator can never err, unless through affection or choice. For example, in translating the French phrase, Il profita d'un avis , he may choose fashionably to say, in violation of the English construction, he profited of an advice ; or, under the sanction of poetical licence, he may choose to engraft the idiom of one language into another, as Mr Macpherson has done, where he says, "Him to the strength of Hercules , the lovely Astyochea bore;" ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/EEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  . Il. lib. 2. l. 165. But it is not with regard to such idiomatic constructions, that a translator will ever find himself under any difficulty. It is in the translation of those particular idiomatic phrases of which every language has its own collection; phrases which are generally of a familiar nature, and which occur most commonly in conversation, or in that species of writing which approaches to the ease of conversation. an idiomatic phrase corresponding to that of the original. Montaigne (Ess. l. 1. c. 29.) says of Gallio, "Lequel ayant  ete envoye en exil en l'isle de Lesbos, on fut averti a Rome qu'il s'y donnoit du bon temps , et que ce qu'on lui avoit enjoint pour peine, lui tournoit  a commodite." The difficulty of translating this sentence, lies in the idiomatic phrase, " qu'il s'y donnoit du bon temps ." Cotton finding a parallel idiom in English, has translated the passage with becoming ease and spirit: "As it happened to one Gallio, who having been sent an exile to the isle of Lesbos, news was not long after brought to Rome, that he there lived as merry as the day was long ; and that what had been enjoined him for a penance, turned out to his greatest pleasure and satisfaction." Thus, in another passage of the same author, (Essais, l. 1. c. 29.) Si j'eusse et e chef de part , j'eusse prins autre voye plus naturelle." Had I rul'd the roast , I should have taken another and more natural course." So likewise, (Ess. l. 1. c. 25.) "Mais d'y enfoncer plus avant, et de m' etre ronge les ongles a l'etude d' Aristote , monarche de la doctrine moderne." "But, to dive farther than that, and to have cudgell'd my brains in the study of Aristotle , the monarch of all modern learning." So, in the following passages from Terence, translated by Eachard: " Credo manibus pedibusque obnix e omnia facturum ." Andr. Act. 1. I know he'll be at it tooth and nail." Herus, quantum audio, uxore excidit , And. Act. 2. "For aught I perceive, my poor master may go whistle for a wife." corresponding idioms, than Sterne has given in the translation of Slawkenbergius's Tale.

Ibid. composition, as a happy use of idiomatic phrases, there is nothing which a translator, who has a moderate command of his own language, is so apt to carry to a licentious extreme. Eachard, whose translations of Terence and of Plautus have, upon the whole, much merit, is extremely censurable for his intemperate use of idiomatic phrases. In the first act of the Andria , Davus thus speaks to himself: Enimvero, Dave, nihil loci est segnitioe neque socordioe.

This, to use a phrase borrowed from painting, may be termed an offence against the costume . Cicero in his oration for Archias, says, " Persona quoe propter otium et studium minime in judiciis periculisque versata est ." M. Patru has translated this, "Un homme que ses  etudes et ses livres ont eloigne du commerce du Palais ." The Palais , or the Old Palace of the kings of France, it is true, is the place where the parliament of Paris and the chief courts of justice were assembled for the decision of causes; but it is just as absurd to make Cicero talk of his haranguing in the Palais , as it would be, of his pleading in Westminster- Hall. In this respect, Eachard is most notoriously faulty: We find in every page of his translations of Terence and Plautus, the most incongruous jumble of ancient and of modern manners. He talks of the "Lord Chief Justice of Athens," Jam tu autem nobis Proeturam geris ? Pl.

The same ancients, in Mr Eachard's translation, are familiarly acquainted with the modern invention of gunpowder; "Had we but a mortar now to play upon them under the covert way, one bomb would make them scamper," Fundam tibi nunc nimis vellem dari, ut tu illos procul hinc ex oculto coederes, facerent fugam , Ter. Eun. act 4. And as their soldiers swear and fight, so they must needs drink like the moderns: "This god can't afford one brandy-shop in all his dominions," Ne Thermopolium quidem ullum ille instruit , Pl. Rud. act 2. sc. 9. In the same comedy, Plautus, who wrote 180 years before Christ, alludes to the battle of La Hogue, fought A. D. 1692. "I'll be as great as a king," says Gripus, "I'll have a Royal Sun 26 for pleasure, like the King of France, and sail about from port to port," Navibus magnis mercaturam faciam , Pl. Rud. act 4. sc. 2. A translator will often meet with idiomatic phrases in the original author, to which no corresponding idiom can be found in the language of the translation. As a literal translation of such phrases cannot be tolerated, the only resource is, to express the sense in plain and easy language. Cicero, in one of his letters to Papirius P aetus, says, " Veni igitur, si vires, et disce jam ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  quas quoeris; etsi sus Minervam ," Ep. ad Fam. 9. 18. The idiomatic phrase si vires , is capable of a perfect translation by a corresponding idiom; but that which occurs in the latter part of the sentence, etsi sus Minervam , can neither be translated by a corresponding idiom, nor yet literally. Mr Melmoth has thus happily expressed the sense of the whole passage: "If you have any spirit then, fly hither, and learn from our elegant bills of fare how to refine your own; though, to do your talents justice, this is a sort of knowledge in which you are much superior to your instructors." ---Pliny, in one of his epistles to Cal[illeg.]isius, thus addresses him, Assem para, et accipe auream fabulam: fabulas immo: nam me priorum nova admonuit , lib. 2. ep. 20. To this expression assem para ,  &c. which is a proverbial mode of speech, we have nothing that corresponds in English. To translate the phrase literally would have a poor effect: "Give me a penny, and take a golden story, or a story worth gold." Mr Melmoth has given the sense in easy language: Are you inclined to hear a story? or, if you please, two or three? for one brings to my mind another." must fail, where the merit of the passage to be translated actually lies in that expression which is idiomatical. This will often occur in epigrams, many of which are therefore incapable of translation: Thus, in the following epigram the point of wit lies in an idiomatic phrase, and is lost in every other language where the same precise idiom does not occur: Le Diable Boiteux est aimable; Le Sage y triomphe aujourdhui; Tout ce qu' on a fait apres lui N'a pas valu le Diable. We say in English, "'Tis not worth a fig;" or, "'tis not worth a farthing;" but we cannot say, as the French do, "'Tis not worth the devil;" and therefore the epigram cannot be translated into English. Epitre au Roi , where the merit lies in the ludicrous naivet e of the last line, which is idiomatical, and has no strictly corresponding expression in English: J'avois un jour un valet de Gascogne, Gourmand, yvrogne, et assure menteur, Pipeur, larron, jureur, blasphemateur, Sentant la hart de cent pas a la ronde: Au demeurant le meilleur filz du monde. have none which has the same naivet e , and therefore no justice can be done to this passage by any English translation. Difficulty of translating Don Quixote, from its idiomatic Phraseology.---Of the best Translations of that Novel.---Comparison of the Translation by Motteux with that by Smollet. justice in a translation than the Don Quixote of Cervantes . This difficulty arises from the extreme frequency of its idiomatic phrases. As the Spanish language is in itself highly idiomatical, even the narrative part of the book is on that account difficult; but the colloquial part is studiously filled with idioms, as one of the principal characters continually expresses himself in proverbs. Of this work there have been many English translations, executed, as may be supposed, with various degrees of merit. The two best of these, in my opinion, are the translations of Motteux and Smollet, both of them writers eminently well qualified for the task they undertook. It will not be foreign to the purpose of this Essay, if I shall here make a short comparative estimate of the merit of these translations  27 . Smollet inherited from nature a strong sense of ridicule, a great fund of original humour, and a happy versatility of talent, by which he could accommodate his style to almost every species of writing. He could adopt alternately the solemn, the lively, the sarcastic, the burlesque, and the vulgar. To these qualifications he joined an inventive genius, and a vigorous imagination. As he possessed talents equal to the composition of original works of the same species with the novel of Cervantes; so it is not perhaps possible to conceive a writer more completely qualified to give a perfect translation of that novel. Motteux , with no great abilities as an original writer, appears to me to have been endowed with a strong perception of the ridiculous in human character; a just discernment of the weaknesses and follies of mankind. He seems likewise to have had a great command of the various styles which are accommodated to the expression both of grave burlesque, and of low humour. Inferior to Smollet in inventive genius, he seems to have equalled him in every quality which was essentially requisite to a translator of Don Quixote. It may therefore be supposed, that the contest between them will be nearly equal, and the question of preference very difficult to be decided. It would have been so, had Smollet confided in his own strength, and bestowed on his task that time and labour which the length and difficulty of the work required: but Smollet too often wrote in such circumstances, that dispatch was his primary object. He found various English translations at hand, which he judged might save him the labour of a new composition. Jarvis could give him faithfully the sense of his author; and it was necessary, only to polish his asperities, and lighten his heavy and aukward phraseology. To contend with Motteux, Smollet found it necessary to assume the armour of Jarvis. This author had purposely avoided, through the whole of his work, the smallest coincidence of expression with Motteux, whom, with equal presumption and injustice, he accuses in his preface of having "taken his version wholly from the French  28 ." We find, therefore, both in the translation of Jarvis and in that of Smollet, which is little else than an improved edition of the former, that there is a studied rejection of the phraseology of Motteux. Now, Motteux, though he has frequently assumed too great a licence, both in adding to and retrenching from the ideas of his original, has upon the whole a very high degree of merit as a translator. In the adoption of corresponding idioms he has been eminently fortunate, and, as in these there is no great latitude, he has in general preoccupied the appropriated phrases; so that a succeeding translator, who proceeded on the rule of invariably rejecting his phraseology, must have, in general, altered for the worse. Such, I have said, was the rule laid down by Jarvis, and by his copist and improver, Smollet, who by thus absurdly rejecting what his own judgment and taste must have approved, has produced a composition decidedly inferior, on the whole, to that of Motteux. While I justify the opinion I have now given, by comparing several passages of both translations, I shall readily allow full credit to the performance of Smollet, where-ever I find that there is a real superiority to the work of his rival translator. which the Knight, Sancho, and Rozinante, were all most grievously mauled, his faithful squire lays his master across his ass, and conducts him to the nearest inn, where a miserable bed is made up for him in a garret. Cervantes then proceeds as follows: En esta maldita cama se accost o Don Quixote: y luego la ventera y su hija le emplastaron de arriba abaxo, alumbrandoles Maritornes: que asi se llamaba la Asturiana. Y como al vizmalle, viese la ventera tan acardenalado a partes a Don Quixote, dixo que aquello mas parecian golpes que caida. No fueron golpes, dixo Sancho, sino que la pena tenia muchos picos y tropezones, y que cada uno habia hecho su cardinal, y tambien le dixo: haga vuestra merced, sennora, de manera que queden algunas estopas, que no faltara quien las haya menester, que tambien me duelen a mi un poco los lomos. Desa manera, respondio la ventera, tambien debistes vos de caer? No cai, dico Sancho Panza, sino que del sobresalto que tome de ver caer a mi amo, de tal manera me duele a mi el cuerpo, que me parece que me ban dado mil palos. " In this ungracious bed was the Knight laid to rest his belaboured carcase; and presently the hostess and her daughter anointed and plastered him all over, while Maritornes, (for that was the name of the Asturian wench), held the candle. The hostess, while she greased him, wondering to see him so bruised all over, I fancy, said she, those bumps look much more like a dry beating than a fall. 'Twas no d y beating, mistress, I promise you, quoth Sancho; but the rock had I know not how many cragged ends and knobs, and every one of them gave my master a token of its kindness. And by the way, forsooth, continued he, I beseech you save a little of that same tow and ointment for me too, for I don't know what's the matter with my back, but I fancy I stand mainly in want of a little greasing too. What, I suppose you fell too, quoth the landlady. Not I, quoth Sancho, but the very fright that I took to see my master tumble down the rock, has so wrought upon my body, that I am as sore as if I had been sadly mawled." " In this wretched bed Don Quixote having laid himself down, was anointed from head to foot by the good woman and her daughter, while Maritornes (that was the Asturian's name) stood hard by, holding a light. The landlady, in the course of her application, perceiving the Knight's whole body black and blue, observed, that those marks seemed rather the effects of drubbing than of a fall; but Sancho affirmed she was mistaken, and that the marks in question were occasioned by the knobs and corners of the rocks among which he fell. And now, I think of it, said he, pray, Madam, manage matters so as to leave a little of your ointment, for it will be needed, I'll assure you: my own loins are none of the soundest at present. What, did you fall too, said she? I can't say I did, answered the squire; but I was so infected by seeing my master tumble, that my whole body akes, as much as if I had been cudgelled without mercy." easier in point of style, and conveys more forcibly the humour of the dialogue in the original. A few contrasted phrases will shew clearly the superiority of the former. Motteux. "In this ungracious bed was the Knight laid to rest his belaboured carcase." Smollet.

I can't say I did, answered the squire; but I was so infected, &c. Motteux's translation of the above passages than in Smollet's, but greater fidelity to the original. In one part, no fueron golpes , Smollet has improperly changed the first person for the third, or the colloquial style for the narrative, which materially weakens the spirit of the passage. Cada uno habia hecho su cardenal is most happily translated by Motteux, "every one of them gave him a token of its kindness;" but in Smollet's version, this spirited clause of the sentence evaporates altogether.--- Algunas estopas is more faithfully rendered by Motteux than by Smollet. In the latter part of the passage, when the hostess jeeringly says to Sancho, Desa manera tambien debistes vos de caer ? the squire, impatient to wipe off that sly insinuation against the veracity of his story, hastily answers, No cai . To this Motteux has done ample justice, "Not I, quoth Sancho." But Smollet, instead of the arch effrontery which the author meant to mark by this answer, gives a tame apologetic air to the squire's reply, "I can't say I did, answered the squire." Don Quix. par. 1. cap. 16\. have their ears assailed at once by a combination of the most horrible sounds, the roaring of cataracts, clanking of chains, and loud strokes repeated at regular intervals; all which persuade the Knight, that his courage is immediately to be tried in a most perilous adventure. Under this impression, he felicitates himself on the immortal renown he is about to acquire, and, brandishing his lance, thus addresses Sancho, whose joints are quaking with affright: Asi que aprieta un poco las cinchas a Rocinante, y qu edate a Dios, y asperame aqui hasta tres dias, no mas, en los quales si no volviere, puedes tu volverte a nuestra aldea, y desde alli, por hacerme merced y buena obra, iras al Toboso, donde diras al incomparable sennora mia Dulcinea, que su cautivo caballero muri o por acometer cosas, que le hiciesen digno de poder llamarse suyo. Don Quix. par. 1. cap. 20. " Come , girth Rozinante Straiter, and then Providence protect thee: Thou may'st stay for me here; but if I do not return in three days, go back to our village, and from thence, for my sake, to Toboso, where thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea, that her faithful knight fell a sacrifice to love and honour, while he attempted things that might have made him worthy to be called her adorer." " Therefore straiten Rozinante's girth, recommend thyself to God, and wait for me in this place, three days at farthest; within which time if I come not back, thou mayest return to our village, and, as the last favour and service done to me, go from thence to Toboso, and inform my incomparable mistress Dulcinea, that her captive knight died in attempting things that might render him worthy to be called her lover." better preserved the ludicrous solemnity of the original. This is particularly observable in the beginning of the sentence, where there is a most humorous association of two counsels very opposite in their nature, the recommending himself to God, and girding Rozinante. In the request, "and as the last favour and service done to me, go from thence to Toboso;" the translations of Smollet and Motteux are, perhaps, nearly equal in point of solemnity, but the simplicity of the original is better preserved by Smollet  29 . in this perilous adventure, takes advantage of the darkness to tie Rozinante's legs together, and thus to prevent him from stirring from the spot; which being done, to divert the Knight's impatience under this supposed enchantment, he proceeds to tell him, in his usual strain of rustic buffoonery, a long story of a cock and a bull, which thus begins: " Erase que se era, el bien que viniere para todos sea, y el mal para quien lo fuere a buscar; y advierta vuestra merced, sennor mio, que el principio que los antiguos dieron a sus consejas, no fue asi como quiera, que fue una sentencia de Caton Zonzorino Romano que dice, y el mal para quien lo fuere a buscar ." Ibid. first , the beginning, which seems to be a customary prologue to a nursery-tale among the Spaniards, which must therefore be translated by a corresponding phraseology in English; and secondly , the blunder of Caton Zonzorino . Both these are, I think, most happily hit off by Motteux. "In the days of yore, when it was as it was, good betide us all, and evil to him that evil seeks. And here, Sir, you are to take notice, that they of old did not begin their tales in an ordinary way; for 'twas a saying of a wise man, whom they call'd Cato the Roman Tonsor, that said, Evil to him that evil seeks." Smollet thus translates the passage: "There was, so there was; the good that shall fall betide us all; and he that seeks evil may meet with the devil. Your worship may take notice, that the beginning of ancient tales is not just what came into the head of the teller: no, they always began with some saying of Cato, the censor of Rome, like this, of "He that seeks evil may meet with the devil." itself, nor does it resemble the usual preface of a foolish tale. Instead of Caton Zonzorino , a blunder which apologises for the mention of Cato by such an ignorant clown as Sancho, we find the blunder rectified by Smollet, and Cato dignified with his proper epithet of the Censor. This is a manifest impropriety in the last translator, for which no other cause can be assigned, than that his predecessor had preoccupied the blunder of Cato the Tonsor , which, though not a translation of Zonzorino , (the purblind), was yet a very happy parallelism. Asi que, yendo dias y viniendo dias, el diablo que no duerme y que todo lo anasca, hizo de manera, que el amor quc el pastor tenia a su pastora se volviese en omecillo y mala voluntad, y la cause fue segun malas lenguas, una cierta cantidad de zelillos que ella le dio, tales que pasaban de la raya, y llegaban a lo vedado, y fue tanto lo que el pastor la aborrecio de alli adelante, que por no verla se quiso ausentar de aquella tierra, e irse donde sus ojos no la viesen jamas: la Toralva, que se vio desdenada del Lope, luego le quiso bien mas que nunca le habia querido . Ibid. " Well , but, as you know, days come and go, and time and straw makes medlars ripe; so it happened, that after several days coming and going, the devil, who seldom lies dead in a ditch, but will have a finger in every pye, so brought it about, that the shepherd fell out with his sweetheart, insomuch that the love he bore her turned into dudgeon and ill-will; and the cause was, by report of some mischievous tale-carriers, that bore no good-will to either party, for that the shepherd thought her no better than she should be, a little loose i' the hilts,  &c  30 . Thereupon being grievous in the dumps about it, and now bitterly hating her, he e'en resolved to leave that country to get out of her sight: for now, as every dog has his day, the wench perceiving he came no longer a suitering to her, but rather toss'd his nose at her and shunn'd her, she began to love him, and doat upon him like any thing." I believe it will be allowed, that the above translation not only conveys the complete sense and spirit of the original, but that it greatly improves upon its humour. When Smollet came to translate this passage, he must have severely felt the hardship of that law he had imposed on himself, of invariably rejecting the expressions of Motteux, who had in this instance been eminently fortunate. It will not therefore surprise us, if we find the new translator to have here failed as remarkably as his predecessor has succeeded. " And so, in process of time, the devil, who never sleeps, but wants to have a finger in every pye , managed matters in such a manner, that the shepherd's love for the shepherdess was turned into malice and deadly hate: and the cause, according to evil tongues, was a certain quantity of small jealousies she gave him, exceeding all bounds of measure. And such was the abhorrence the shepherd conceived for her, that, in order to avoid the sight of her, he resolved to absent himself from his own country, and go where he should never set eyes on her again. Toralvo finding herself despised by Lope, began to love him more than ever." possible free translation, and that he had supplanted him in the choice of corresponding idioms, seems to have piqued himself on a rigid adherence to the very letter of his original. The only English idiom, being a plagiarism from Motteux, " wants to have a finger in every pye ," seems to have been adopted from absolute necessity: the Spanish phrase would not bear a literal version, and no other idiom was to be found but that which Motteux had preoccupied. same law, of invariably rejecting the phraseology of Motteux, we find in every page of this new translation numberless changes for the worse: Se que no mira de mal ojo a la mochacha. "I have observed he casts a sheep's eye at the wench." Motteux. "I can perceive he has no dislike to the girl." Smollet. Teresa me pusieron en el bautismo, nombre mondo y escueto, sin anadiduras, ni cortopizas, ni arrequives de Dones ni Donas. "I was christened plain Teresa, without any fiddle-faddle, or addition of Madam, or Your Ladyship." Motteux. "Teresa was I christened, a bare and simple name, without the addition, garniture, and embroidery of Don or Donna." Smollet. "Go on with thy story, Sancho." Motteux. "Follow thy story, Sancho." Smollet. Yo confieso que he andado algo risueno en demasia. "I confess I carried the jest too far." Motteux. "I see I have exceeded a little in my pleasantry." Smollet. De mis vi ñas vengo, no se nada, no soy amigo de saber vidas agenas. "I never thrust my nose into other men's porridge; it's no bread and butter of mine: Every man for himself, and God for us all, say I." Motteux. "I prune my own vine, and I know nothing about thine. I never meddle with other people's concerns." Smollet. Y advierta que ya tengo edad para dar consejos. Quien bien tiene, y mal escoge, por bien que se enoja, no se venga. "Come, Master, I have hair enough in my beard to make a counsellor: he that will not when he may, when he will he shall have nay." Motteux. "Take notice that I am of an age to give good counsels. He that hath good in his view, and yet will not evil eschew, his folly deserveth to rue." Smollet . Rather than adopt the corresponding proverb given by Motteux, Smollet chuses, in this instance, and in many others, to make a proverb for himself, by giving a literal version of the original in a sort of doggrel rhime. Vive Roque, que es la se ñora nuestra ama mas ligera que un alcotan, y que puede ensenar al mas diestro Cordobes o Mexicano. "By the Lord Harry, quoth Sancho, our Lady Mistress is as nimble as an eel. Let me be hang'd, if I don't think she might teach the best jockey in Cordova or Mexico to mount ahorseback." Motteux. "By St Roque, cried Sancho, my Lady Mistress is as light as a hawk  31 , and can teach the most dexterous horseman to ride." Smollet. Motteux and Smollet. But the discourse of the boy who explains the story of the piece, in Motteux's translation, appears somewhat more consonant to the phraseology commonly used on such occasions: ---"Now, gentlemen, in the next place, mark that personage that peeps out there with a crown on his head, and a sceptre in his hand: That's the Emperor Charlemain.---Mind how the Emperor turns his back upon him.--- Don't you see that Moor;---hear what a smack he gives on her sweet lips,--- and see how she spits, and wipes her mouth with her white smock-sleeve. See how she takes on, and tears her hair for very madness, as if it was to blame for this affront.---Now mind what a din and hurly-burly there is." Motteux . This jargon appears to me to be more characteristic of the speaker than the following: "And that personage who now appears with a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, is the Emperor Charlemagne.---Behold how the Emperor turns about and walks off.--- Don't you see that Moor;---Now mind how he prints a kiss in the very middle of her lips, and with what eagerness she spits, and wipes them with the sleeve of her shift, lamenting aloud, and tearing for anger her beautiful hair, as if it had been guilty of the transgression  32 ." are translated by Motteux with a corresponding na ivete of expression, which it seems to me impossible to exceed: Jugando est a a las tablas Don Gayferos, Que ya de Melisendra est a olvidado. "Now Gayferos the live-long day, Oh, errant shame! at draughts doth play; And, as at court most husbands do, Forgets his lady fair and true. Motteux. "Now Gayferos at tables playing, Of Melisendra thinks no more." Smollet. Caballero, si a Francia ides, Por Gays eros preguntad. "Quoth Melisendra, if perchance, Sir Traveller, you go for France, For pity's sake, ask, when you're there, For Gayferos, my husband dear." Motteux. "Sir Knight, if you to France do go, For Gayferos inquire." Smollet. How miserably does the new translator sink in the above comparison! Yet Smollet was a good poet, and most of the verse translations interspersed through this work are executed with ability. It is on this head that Motteux has assumed to himself the greatest licence. He has very presumptuously mutilated the poetry of Cervantes, by leaving out many entire stanzas from the larger compositions, and suppressing some of the smaller altogether: Yet the translation of those parts which he has retained, is possessed of much poetical merit; and in particular, those verses which are of a graver cast, are, in my opinion, superior to those of his rival. The song in the first volume, which in the original is intitled Cancion de Gris ostomo , and which Motteux has intitled, The Despairing Lover , is greatly abridged by the suppression of more than one half of the stanzas in the original; but the translation, so far as it goes, is highly poetical. The translation of this song by Smollet, though inferior as a poem, is, perhaps, more valuable on the whole, because more complete. There is, however, only a single passage in which he maintains with Motteux a contest which is nearly equal: O thou, whose cruelty and hate, The tortures of my breast proclaim, Behold, how willingly to fate I offer this devoted frame. If thou, when I am past all pain, Shouldst think my fall deserves a tear, Let not one single drop distain Those eyes, so killing and so clear. No! rather let thy mirth display The joys that in thy bosom flow: Ah! need I bid that heart be gay, Which always triumph'd in my woe. Smollet. last stanza in particular is eminently beautiful and delicate. Yet there is in my opinion an equal vein of poetry, and more passion, in the corresponding verses of Motteux: O thou, by whose destructive hate I'm hurry'd to this doleful fate, When I'm no more, thy pity spare! I dread thy tears; oh, spare them then--- But, oh! I rave, I was too vain--- My death can never cost a tear! Motteux. expression with ingenious thought; the versification is likewise of a peculiar structure, the second line forming an echo to the first. This song has been translated in a corresponding measure both by Motteux and Smollet; but by the latter with far inferior merit. Quien menoscaba mis bienes? Desdenes. Y quien aumenta mis duelos? Los zelos. Y quien prueba mi paciencia? Ausencia. De ese modo en mi dolencia Ningun remedio se alcanza Pues me matan la esperanza Desdenes, Zelos y Ausencia. Quien me causa este dolor? Amor. Y quien mi gloria repuna? Fortuna. Y quien consiente mi duelo? El Cielo. De ese modo yo rezelo, Morir deste mal extrano Pues se aunan en mi dano Amor, Fortuna y el Cielo. Quien mejorara mi suerte? La Muerte. Y el bien de amor, quien le alcanza? Mudanza. Y sus males quien los cura? Locura. De ese modo no es cordura Querer curar la pasion; Quando los remedios son Muerte, Mudanza, y Locura. What makes me languish and complain? O, ' tis Disdain ! What yet more fiercely tortures me? 'Tis jealousy. How have I my patience lost? By Absence crost. Then Hope, farewell, there's no relief; I sink beneath oppressing grief; Nor can a wretch, without despair, Scorn, Jealousy , and Absence , bear. What in my breast this anguish drove? Intruding Love. Who could such mighty ills create? Blind Fortune's hate. What cruel powers my fate approve? The Powers above. Then let me bear, and cease to moan; 'Tis glorious thus to be undone: When these invade, who dares oppose? Heaven, Love , and Fortune are my foes. Where shall I find a speedy cure, Oh! Death is sure. No milder means to set me free? Inconstancy. Can nothing else my pains assuage? Distracting rage. What, die or change? Lucinda lose? O let me rather madness chuse! But judge, ye gods, what we endure, When death or madness are a cure! the original than is allowable for a translator. It must be owned, however, that he has much improved it. Ah! what inspires my woful strain? Unkind Disdain! Ah! what augments my misery? Fell Jealousy! Or say what hath my patience worn? An absent lover's scorn! The torments then that I endure No mortal remedy can cure: For every languid hope is slain By Absence, Jealousy, Disdain. From Love, my unrelenting foe, These sorrows flow: My infant glory's overthrown By Fortune's frown. Confirm'd in this my wretched state By the decrees of Fate, In death alone I hope release From this compounded dire disease, Whose cruel pangs to aggravate, Fortune and Love conspire with Fate! Ah! what will mitigate my doom? The silent tomb. Ah! what retrieve departed joy? Inconstancy! Or say, can ought but frenzy bear This tempest of despair! All other efforts then are vain To cure this soul-tormenting pain, That owns no other remedy Than madness, death, inconstancy. "The torments then that I endure--- no mortal remedy can cure." Who ever heard of a mortal remedy? or who could expect to be cured by it? In the next line, the epithet of languid is injudiciously given to Hope in this place; for a languid or a languishing hope was already dying, and needed not so powerful a host of murderers to slay it, as Absence, Jealousy, and Disdain.---In short, the latter translation appears to me to be on the whole of much inferior merit to the former. I have remarked, that Motteux excels his rival chiefly in the translation of those poems that are of a graver cast. But perhaps he is censurable for having thrown too much gravity into the poems that are interspersed in this work, as Smollet is blameable on the opposite account, of having given them too much the air of burlesque. In the song which Don Quixote composed while he was doing penance in the Sierra-Morena , beginning Arboles, Yerbas y Plantas , every stanza of which ends with Del Toboso , the author intended, that the composition should be quite characteristic of its author, a ludicrous compound of gravity and absurdity. In the translation of Motteux there is perhaps too much gravity; but Smollet has rendered the composition altogether burlesque. The same remark is applicable to the song of Antonio, beginning Yo s e, Olalla, que me adoras , and to many of the other poems. far the best we have yet seen of the Novel of Cervantes; and that if corrected in its licentious abbreviations and enlargements, and in some other particulars which I have noticed in the course of this comparison, we should have nothing to desire superior to it in the way of translation. The Genius of the Translator should be akin to that of the original Author. ---The best Translators have shone in original Composition of the same Species with that which they have translated.---Of Voltaire's Translations from Shakespeare.--- Of the peculiar Character of the Wit of Voltaire.---His Translation from Hudibras. ---Excellent anonymous French Translation of Hudibras.---Translation of Rabelais by Urquhart and Motteux. foregoing essay I have endeavoured to illustrate, it will appear no unnatural conclusion to assert, that he only is perfectly accomplished for the duty of a translator who possesses a genius akin to that of the original author. I do not mean to carry this proposition so far as to affirm, that in order to give a perfect translation of the works of Cicero, a man must actually be as great an orator, or inherit the same extent of philosophical genius; but he must have a mind capable of discerning the full merits of his original, of attending with an acute perception to the whole of his reasoning, and of entering with warmth and energy of feeling into all the beauties of his composition. Thus we shall observe invariably, that the best translators have been those writers who have composed original works of the same species with those which they have translated. The mutilated version which yet remains to us of the Tim aeus of Plato translated by Cicero, is a masterly composition, which, in the opinion of the best judges, rivals the merit of the original. A similar commendation cannot be bestowed on those fragments of the Phaenomena of Aratus translated into verse by the same author; for Cicero's poetical talents were not remarkable: but who can entertain a doubt, that had time spared to us his versions of the orations of Demosthenes and Æschines, we should have found them possessed of the most transcendent merit? translation is less subjected to restraint than prose translation, and allows more of the freedom or original composition. It will hence follow, that to exercise this freedom with propriety, a translator must have the talent of original composition in poetry; and therefore, that in this species of translation, the possession of a genius akin to that of his author, is more essentially necessary than in any other. We know the remark of Denham, that the subtle spirit of poesy evaporates entirely in the transfusion from one language into another, and that unless a new, or an original spirit, is infused by the translator himself, there will remain nothing but a caput mortuum . The best translators of poetry, therefore, have been those who have approved their talents in original poetical composition. Dryden, Pope, Addison, Rowe, Tickell, Pitt, Warton, Mason, and Murphy, rank equally high in the list of original poets, as in that of the translators of poetry. the different species of poetry are extremely distinct, and often opposite in their nature, it is very evident that the possession of talents adequate to one species of translation, as to one species of original poetry, will not infer the capacity of excelling in other species of which the character is different. Still further, it may be observed, that as there are certain species of poetical composition, as, for example, the dramatic, which, though of the same general character in all nations, will take a strong tincture of difference from the manners of a country, or the peculiar genius of a people; so it will be found, that a poet, eminent as an original author in his own country, may fail remarkably in attempting to convey, by a translation, an idea of the merits of a foreign work which is tinctured by the national genius of the country which produced it. Of this we have a striking example in those translations from Shakespeare by Voltaire; in which the French poet, great himself in dramatical composition, intended to convey to his countrymen a just idea of our most celebrated author in the same department. But Shakespeare and Voltaire, though perhaps akin to each other in some of the great features of the mind, were widely distinguished even by nature, in the characters of their poetical genius; and this natural distinction was still more sensibly encreased by the general tone of manners, the hue and fashion of thought of their respective countries. Voltaire, in his essay sur la Trag edie Angloise , has chosen the famous soliloquy in the tragedy of Hamlet, " To be, or not to be ," as one of those striking passages which best exemplify the genius of Shakespeare, and which, in the words of the French author, demandent grace pour toutes ses fautes . It may therefore be presumed, that the translator in this instance endeavoured, as far as lay in his power, not only to adopt the spirit of his author, but to represent him as favourably as possible to his countrymen. Yet, how wonderfully has he metamorphosed, how miserably disfigured him! In the original, we have the perfect picture of a mind deeply agitated, giving vent to its feelings in broken starts of utterance, and in language which plainly indicates, that the speaker is reasoning solely with his own mind, and not with any auditor. In the translation, we have a formal and connected harangue, in which it would appear, that the author, offended with the abrupt manner of the original, and judging those irregular starts of expression to be unsuitable to that precision which is required in abstract reasoning, has corrected, as he thought, those defects of the original, and given union, strength, and precision, to this philosophical argument. Demeure, il faut choisir, et passer a l'instant De la vie a la mort, ou de l'etre au neant. Dieux justes, s'il en est, eclairez mon courage. Faut-il vieillir courbe sous la main qui m'outrage, Supporter, ou finir mon malheur et mon sort? Que suis-je? qui m'arreCte? et qu' est que la mort? C'est la sin de nos maux, c'est mon unique azile; Apres de longs transports, c'est un sommeil tranquile. On s'endort et tout meurt; mais un affreux reveil, Doit succeder peutetre aux douceurs du sommeil. On nous menace; on dit que cette courte vie De tourmens eternels est aussitot suivie. O mort! moment fatale! affreuse eternite! Tout coeur a ton seul nom se glace epouvante. Eh! qui pourrait sans toi supporter cette vie? De nos pretres menteurs benir l'hypocrisie? D'une indigne maitresse encenser les erreurs? Ramper sous un ministre, adorer ses hauteurs? Et montrer les langueurs de son ame abattue, A des amis ingrats qui detournent la vue? La mort serait trop douce en ces extremites. Mais le scrupule parle, et nous crie, arretez. Il defend a nos mains cet heureux homicide, Et d'un heros guerrier, fait un Chretien timide  33 connected reasoning, to the desultory range of thought and abrupt transitions of the original, Voltaire has in this passage, by the looseness of his paraphrase, allowed some of the most striking beauties, both of the thought and expression, entirely to escape; while he has superadded, with unpardonable licence, several ideas of his own, not only unconnected with the original, but dissonant to the general tenor of the speaker's thoughts. Adopting Voltaire's own style of criticism on the translations of the Abb e des Fontaines, we may ask him, "Where do we find in this translation of Hamlet's soliloquy The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune--- To take arms against a sea of trouble--- The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to--- \---Perchance to dream; ay, there's the rub--- The whips and scorns of time--- The law's delay, the insolence of office--- The spurns---that patient merit from th' unworthy thy takes--- That undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns---?" peculiarities of thought and expression, be said to have given a translation from Shakespeare? liberal addition of several new and original ideas of his own. Hamlet, whose character in Shakespeare exhibits the strongest impressions of religion, who feels these impressions even to a degree of superstition, which influences his conduct in the most important exigences, and renders him weak and irresolute, appears in Mr Voltaire's translation a thorough sceptic and freethinker. In the course of a few lines, he expresses his doubt of the existence of a God; he treats the priests as liars and hypocrites, and the Christian religion as a system which debases human nature, and makes a coward of a hero: Dieux justes! S'il en est--- De nos pretres menteurs benir l'hypocrisie--- Et d'un heros guerrier, fait un Chretien timide--- superstitious Hamlet into a modern philosophe and Esprit fort ? Whether the French author meant by this transmutation to convey to his countrymen a favourable idea of our English bard, we cannot pretend to say; but we may at least affirm, that he has not conveyed a just one  34 give a just idea of the merits of his original, from accomplishing what he wished? Not ignorance of the language; for Voltaire, though no great critic in the English tongue, had yet a competent knowledge of it; and the change he has put upon the reader was not involuntary, or the effect of ignorance. Neither was it the want of genius, or of poetical talents; for Voltaire is certainly one of the best poets, and one of the greatest ornaments of the drama. But it was the original difference of his genius and that of Shakespeare, increased by the general opposition of the national character of the French and English. His mind, accustomed to connect all ideas of dramatic sublimity or beauty with regular design and perfect symmetry of composition, could not appretiate this union of the great and beautiful with irregularity of structure and partial disproportion. He was capable indeed of discerning some features of majesty in this colossal statue; but the rudeness of the parts, and the want of polish in the whole figure, prevailed over the general impression of its grandeur, and presented it altogether to his eye as a monstrous production. Addison, and of Pope, than to that of Shakespeare: he has therefore succeeded much better in the translations he has given of particular passages from these poets, than in those he has attempted from our great master of the drama. to himself, and which I think has never yet been analysed. It appears to me to be the result of acute philosophical talents, a strong spirit of satire, and a most brilliant imagination. As all wit consists in unexpected combinations, the singular union of a philosophic thought with a lively fancy, which is a very uncommon association, seems in general to be the basis of the wit of Voltaire. It is of a very different species from that wit which is associated with humour, which is exercised in presenting odd, extravagant, but natural views of human character, and which forms the essence of ludicrous composition. The novels of Voltaire have no other scope than to illustrate certain philosophical doctrines, or to expose certain philosophical errors; they are not pictures of life or of manners; and the persons which figure in them are pure creatures of the imagination, fictitious beings, who have nothing of nature in their composition, and who neither act nor reason like the ordinary race of men. Voltaire, then, with a great deal of wit, seems to have had no talent for humorous composition. Now if such is the character of his original genius, we may presume, that he was not capable of justly appretiating in the compositions of others what he did not possess himself. We may likewise fairly conclude, that he should fail in attempting to convey by a translation a just idea of the merits of a work, of which one of the main ingredients is that quality in which he was himself deficient. Of this I proceed to give a strong example. Humour; nor is it easy to say which of these qualities chiefly predominates in the composition. A proof that humour forms a most capital ingredient is, that the inimitable Hogarth has told the whole story of the poem in a series of characteristic prints: now painting is completely adequate to the representation of humour, but can convey no idea of wit. Of this singular poem, Voltaire has attempted to give a specimen to his countrymen by a translation; but in this experiment he says he has found it necessary to concentrate the first four hundred lines into little more than eighty of the translation  35 The truth is, that, either insensible of that part of the merit of the original, or conscious of his own inability to give a just idea of it, he has left out all that constitutes the humour of the painting, and attached himself solely to the wit of the composition. In the original, we have a description of the figure, dress, and accoutrements of Sir Hudibras, which is highly humorous, and which conveys to the imagination as complete a picture as is given by the characteristic etchings of Hogarth. In the translation of Voltaire, all that we learn of those particulars which paint the hero, is, that he wore mustachios, and rode with a pair of pistols. has changed in a great measure its nature, and assimilated itself to that which is peculiar to the translator. The wit of Butler is more concentrated, more pointed, and is announced in fewer words, than the wit of Voltaire. The translator, therefore, though he pretends to have abridged four hundred verses into eighty, has in truth effected this by the retrenchment of the wit of his original, and not by the concentration of it: for when we compare any particular passage or point, we find there is more diffusion in the translation than in the original. Thus, Butler says, The difference was so small, his brain Outweigh'd his rage but half a grain; Which made some take him for a tool That knaves do work with, call'd a fool. Mais malgre sa grande eloquence, Et son merite, et sa prudence, Il passa chez quelques savans Pour etre un de ces instrumens Dont les fripons avec adresse Savent user sans dire mot, Et qu' ils tournent avec souplesse; Cet instrument s' appelle un sot. amplification of the translator, a great portion of its spirit.

Ainsi Taliacotius, Grand Esculape d'Etrurie, Repara tous les nez perdus Par une nouvelle industrie: Il vous prenoit adroitement Un morceau du cu d'un pauvre homme, L'appliquoit au nez proprement; Enfin il arrivait qu' en somme, Tout juste a la mort du preteur Tombait le nez de l'emprunteur, Et souvent dans la meme biere, Par justice et par bon accord, On remettait au gre du mort Le nez aupres de son derriere. translator, contained in the last four lines, the simile loses, upon the whole, very greatly by its diffusion. The following anonymous Latin version of this simile is possessed of much higher merit, as, with equal brevity of expression, it conveys the whole spirit of the original. Sic adscititios nasos de clune torosi Vectoris doct a secuit Talicotius arte, Qui potuere parem durando aequare parentem: At postquam fate clunis computruit, ipsum Un a sympathicum coepit tabescere rostrum. a complete version of the poem of Hudibras, a very remarkable work, with the merits of which (as the book is less known than it deserves to be) I am glad to have this opportunity of making the English reader acquainted: Ainsi Talicot d'une fesse Savoit tailler avec addresse Nez tous neufs, qui ne risquoient rien Tant que le cul se portoit bien; Mais si le cul perdoit la vie, Le nez tomboit par sympathie. original: it is in that additional pleasantry which results from the structure of the verses, the first line ending most unexpectedly with a preposition, and the third with a pronoun, both which are the rhyming syllables in the two couplets: So learned Taliacotius from ,  &c.

It was evidently impossible to imitate this in a translation; but setting this circumstance aside, the merit of the latter French version seems to me to approach very near to that of the original. superior abilities, appears to have been endowed with an uncommon share of modesty. He presents his work to the public with the utmost diffidence; and, in a short preface, humbly deprecates its censure for the presumption that may be imputed to him, in attempting that which the celebrated Voltaire had declared to be one of the most difficult of talks. Yet this talk he has executed in a very masterly manner. A few specimens will shew the high merit of this work, and clearly evince, that the translator possessed that essential requisite for his undertaking, a kindred genius with that of his great original. For his religion, it was fit To match his learning and his wit: 'Twas Presbyterian true blue; For he was of that stubborn crew Of errant saints, whom all men grant To be the true church-militant: Such as do build their faith upon The holy text of pike and gun; Decide all controversies by Infallible artillery; And prove their doctrine orthodox, By apostolic blows and knocks.

French, where the translator has given equal proof of a kindred genius to that of his original, and has as successfully accomplished a task of equal difficulty, it is in the translation of Rabelais , begun by Sr Thomas Urquhart, and finished by Mr Motteux, and lastly, revised and corrected by Mr Ozell. The difficulty of translating this work, arises less from its obsolete style, than from a phraseology peculiar to the author, which he seems to have purposely rendered obscure, in order to conceal that satire which he levels both against the civil government and the ecclesiastical policy of his country. Such is the studied obscurity of this satire, that but a very few of the most learned and acute among his own countrymen have professed to understand Rabelais in the original. The history of the English translation of this work, is in itself a proof of its very high merit. The three first books were translated by Sir Thomas Urquhart, but only two of them were published in his lifetime. Mr Motteux, a Frenchman by birth, but whose long residence in England had given him an equal command of both languages, republished the work of Urquhart, and added the remaining three books translated by himself. In this publication he allows the excellence of the work of his predecssor, whom he declares to have been a complete master of the French language, and to have possessed both learning and fancy equal to the task he undertook. He adds, that he has preserved in his translation "the very style and air of his original;" and finally, "that the English readers may now understand that author better in their own tongue, than many of the French can do in theirs." The work thus completed in English, was taken up by Mr Ozell, a person of considerable literary abilities, and who possessed an uncommon knowledge both of the ancient and modern languages. Of the merits of the translation none could be a better judge, and to these he has given the strongest testimony, by adopting it entirely in his new edition, and limiting his own undertaking solely to the correction of the text of Urquhart and Motteux, to which he has added a translation of the notes of M. Du Chat, who spent, as Mr Ozell informs us, forty years in composing annotations on the original work. The English version of Rabelais thus improved, may be considered, in its present form, as one of the most perfect specimens of the art of translation. The best critics in both languages have borne testimony to its faithful transfusion of the sense, and happy imitation of the style of the original; and every English reader will acknowledge, that it possesses all the ease of original composition. If I have forborne to illustrate any of the rules or precepts of the preceding Essay from this work, my reasons were, that obscurity I have already noticed, which rendered it less fit for the purpose of such illustration, and that strong tincture of licentiousness which characterises the whole work. THE END.
