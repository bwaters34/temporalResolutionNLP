 My name is Skill, my Syre Experience hight, And Memory bred and brought me forth to light. Which thing was meant likewise by the Philosopher that said, that the hand is the instrument of skill. By reason whereof it cometh to pass (say they) that such as speak of matters of Government and state, but specially of matters of war by the book, speak but as book Knights, as the French Proverb termeth them, after the manner of the Grecians, who call him a book Pilot, which hath not the sure and certain knowledge of the things that he speaks of: meaning thereby, that it is not for a man to trust to the understanding which he hath gotten by reading, in things that consist in the deed doing, where the hand is to be set to the work: no more then the often hearing of men talke and reason of painting, or the disputing upon colours, without taking of the pensill in hand, can stand a man in any stead at all to make him a good Painter. But on the contrary part, many have proved wise men and good Captains, which could neither write nor read. Besides this, they alledge further, that in matters of war, all things alter from yeer to yeer; by means whereof the sleights and policies that are to be learned out of books, will serve the turn no more then Mines that are blown up. According whereunto Cambyses telleth his son Cyrus in Xenophon, that like as in Musick the newest songs are commonly the best liked of for once, because they were never heard of afore. So in the wars, those polices that never were practised afore, as those that take best success, and commonly have the best effect, because the enemies do least doubt of them. Nevertheless I am not he that will maintain, that a wise Governor of a Common-weal, or a great Captain, can be made of such a person, as hath never travelled out of his study, and from his book: howbeit that which Cicero writeth of Lucius Lucullus, is true, that when he departed out of Rome as Captain General and Lieutenant of the Romanes, to make war against King Mithridates, he had no experience at all of the wars, and yet afterward he bestowed so great diligence in the reading of histories, and in conferring upon every point with the old Captains and men of long experience whom he carried with him, that by the time of his coming into Asia, where he was indeed to put his matters in execution, he was found to be a very sufficient Captain, as appeared by his deeds: insomuch that by those wayes, clean contrary to the common order of war, he discomfited two of the most puissant and greatest Princes that were at that time in the East. For his understanding was so quick, his care so vigilant, and his courage so great, that he needed no long training, nor gross instruction by experience. And although I grant there have been divers Governors and Captains, which by the only force of nature (furthered by long continued experience) have done goodly and great exploits: yet can it not be denied me, but that if they had matched the gifts of nature with the knowledge of learning and the reading of histories, they might have done much greater things, and they might have become much more perfect. For like as in every other eunning and skill wherein a 1 man intendeth to excell: so also to become a perfect and sufficient person to Govern in peace and war, there are three things of necessity required, namely, Nature, Art, and Practice. Nature (in the case we treat of) must furnish us with a good mother-wit, with a body well disposed to endure all manner of travel, and with a good will to advance our selves: Art must give us judgement and knowledge, gotten by the examples and wise discourses that we have read and double read in good Histories: and Practice will get us readiness, assuredness, and the ease how to put things in execution. For though Skill be the ruler of doing the deed, yet it is Vertue of the mind which teacheth a man the mean point between the two faulty extremities of too much and too little, wherein the commendation of all doings consisteth. And whosoever he is that goeth about to attain to it by the onely trial of experience, and had rather learn it at his own cost, then at another mans: he may well be of the number of those that are touched by this ancient Proverb, which saith . Experience is the School-mistris of fools: because mans life is so short, and experience is hard and dangerous; specially in matters of war, wherein (according to the saying of Tamachus the Athenian Captain) a man cannot fault twice, because the faults are so great, that most commonly they bring with them the overthrow of the state,, or loss of the lives of those that do them. Therefore we must not tarry for this wit that is won by experience, which costeth so dear, and and is so long in coming, that a man is oft times dead in seeking of it before he have attained it, so as he had need of a second life to employ it in, because of the over late coming by it. But me must make speed by our diligent and continual reading of Histories both old and new, that we may enjoy this happiness which the Poet speaketh of: A happy wight is he that by mishaps Of others, doth beware of afterclaps. By the way, as concerning those that say that paper will bear all things: if there be any that unworthily take upon then the name of Historiographers, and do deface the dignity of the story for hatred or favor, mingling any untruth with it: that is not the fault of the History, but of the men that are partial, who do abuse that name unworthily, to cover and cloak their own passions withall, which thing shall never come to pass, if the writer of the story have the properties that are necessary required in a story-writer, as these: That he set aside all affection, be voide of envy, hatred and flattery: that he be a man experienced in the affairs of the world, of good utterance and judgement, to discern what is to be said, and what to be left unsaid; and what would do more harme to have it declared, then do good to have it reproved or condemned: for as much as his chief drift ought to be to serve the Common- weal, and that it is but as a register to set down the judgements and definitive sentences of Gods Court, whereof some are given according to the ordinary course and capacity of our weak natural reason, and other some go according to Gods Infinite Power and Incomprehensible Wisdome, above and against all discourse of mans understanding, who being unable to reach the bottom of his judgements, and to finde out the first motions and grounds thereof, do impute the cause of them to a certain fortune, which is nought else but a fained device of mans wit, dazeled at the beholding of such brightness, and confounded at the gazing of so bottomeless a deep: howbeit, nothing cometh to pass nor is done without the leave of him that is the very right and truth it self, with whom nothing is past or to come, who knoweth and understandeth the very orginal causes of all necessity. The consideration whereof teacheth men to humble themselves under his mighty hand, by acknowledging that there is one first cause which over-ruleth nature, whereof it cometh, that neither hardiness is alwayes happy, nor wisdom alwayes sure of good success. These so-notable commodities are every where accompanied with singular delight, which proceedeth chiefly of diversity and novelty, wherein our nature deligteth, and is greatly desirous of: because we having an earnest inclination towards our best prosperity and advancement, it goeth on still, seeking in it every thing which it taketh to be goodly, or good in this world. But forasmuch as it findeth not wherewith to content it self under the cope of heaven, it is soon weary of the things that it had earnestly desired before, and so goeth on wandering in the unskilfulness of her likings, whereof she never ceaseth to make a continual changing untill she have fully satisfied her desires, by attaining to the last end, which is, to be knit to her chief felicity, where is the full perfection of all goodliness and goodness. This liking of variety cannot be better relieved then by that which is the finder out and the preserver of time, the father of all novelty, and messenger of antiquity. For if we finde a certain singular pleasure, in hearkening to such as be returned from some long voyage, and do report things which they have seen in strange Countries, as the manners of people, the natures of places, and the fashions of lives, differing from ours: and if we be sometime so ravished with delight and pleasure at the hearing of the talke of some wise, discreet, and well spoken old man from whose mouth there floweth a stream of speech sweeter then hony, in rehearsing the adventures which he hath had in his green and youthful yeers, the pains that he hath endured, and the perils that he hath over passed, so as we perceive not how the time goeth away: how much more ought we to be ravished with delight and wondering, to behold the state of mankind, and the true success of things, which antiquity hath and doth bring forth from the beginning of the world; as the setting up of Empires, the overthrow of Monarchies, the rising and falling of Kingdoms, and all things else worthy admiration, and the same lively set forth in the fair, rich, and true table of Eloquence? And that so lively, as in the very reading of them we see our minds to be so touched by them, not as though the things were already done and past, but as though they were even then presently in doing, and we finde our selves carried away with gladness and grief through fear or hope, well near as though we were then at the doing of them: whereas notwithstanding we be not in any pain or danger, but only conceive in our minds the adversities that other folkes have endured, our selves sitting safe with our contentation and ease, according to those verses of the Poet Lucretius: It is a pleasure for to sit at ease Upon the Land, and safely for to see How other folks are tossed on the Seas, That with the blustring winds turmoiled be. Not that the sight of others miseries Doth any way the honest heart delight: But for because it liketh well our eyes. To see harms free, that on our selves might light. Also it is seen that the reading of Histories doth so hold and allure good wits, that divers times it not maketh them to forget all other pleasures, but also serveth very fitly to turn away their griefs, and sometimes also to remedy their diseases. As for example, we find it written of Aphonsus King of Naples, that Prince so greatly renowned in Chronicles for his wisdome and goodness, that being sore sicke in the City of Capua, when his Phisicians had spent all the cunning that they had to recover him his health, and he saw that nothing prevailed: he determined with himself to take no more medicines, but for his recreation caused the story of Quintus Curtius, concerning the deeds of Alexander the Great, to be read before him: at the hearing whereof he took so wonderful pleasure, that nature gathered strength by it, and overcame the waywardness of his disease. Whereupon, having soon recovered his health, he discharged his Phisicians with such words as these: Feast me no more with your Hippocrates and Galene, sith they can no skill to helpe me to recover my health: but well fare Quintus Curtius, that could so good skill to help me to recover my health. Now if the reading and knowledge of Histories be delightful and profitable to all other kind of folke: I say it is much more for great Princes and Kings, because they have to do with charges of greatest weight and difficulties, to be best stored with gifts and knowledge for the discharge of their duties: seeing the ground of stories is, to treat of all manner of high matter of estate, as wars, battels, Cities, Countries, treaties of peace and alliances; and therefore it seemeth more fit for them, then for any other kind of degrees of men: because they being bred and brought up tenderly, and at their ease, by reason of the great regard and care that is had of their persons (as meet is for so great states to have) they take not so great pains in their youth for the learning of things as behooveth those to take which will learn the noble ancient languages, and the paineful doctrine comprehended in Philosophy. Againe, when they come to mans estate, their charge calleth them to deal in great affairs, so as there remaineth no exercise of Wit more convenient for them, than the reading of Histories in their owne Tongue; which without paine is able to teach them even with great pleasure and ease, whatsoever the painfull Workes of the Philosophers concerning the Government of Common-wealths, can shew them, to make them skilfull in the well Ruling and Governing of the People and Countries that God hath put under their subjection. But the worst is, that they ever (or for the most part) have such manner of persons about them, as seeke nothing else but to please them by all the waies they can, and there are very few that dare tell them the truth freely in all things: Whereas on the contrary part, an History flattereth them not, but layeth open before their eyes the faults and vices of such as were like them in greatnesse of Degree. And therefore Demetrius Phalerius ( a man renowned as well for his skill in the good Government of a Common-weale, as for his excellent Knowledge otherwise) counselled Ptolomy, first King of Ægypt after the death of Alexander the Great, that he should often and diligently reade the Bookes that treated of the Government of Kingdomes, because (said he) thou shalt finde many things there, which thy servants and familiar friends dare not tell thee: Moreover this is another thing, that such great Personages cannot easily travell out of the bounds of their Dominions, to go view strange Countries, as private persons do: because the jealousie of their Estate, and the regard of their Dignity, requires that they should never be in place where another man might command them. And oftentimes for want of having seen the Countries, and knowne the People and Princes that are their neighbours, they have adventured upon Attempts without good ground: To avoid the which, the instruction they may have by the reading of Histories, is one of the easiest and fittest remedies that can be found. And though there were none other cause than onely this last, surely it ought to induce Princes to the often and diligent reading of Histories, wherein are written the Heroicall Deeds of Wise and Valiant Men, specially of Kings that have been before them: the consideration whereof may cause them to be desirous to become like them, specially which were of Stately and Noble Courage: because the seeds of Princely Vertues that are bred with themselves, do then quicken them up with an emulation towards those that have been or are equall in Degree with them, as well in respect of Noblenesse of Blood, as of Greatnesse of State, so as they be loth to give place to any person, and much lesse can finde in their hearts to be out-gone in Glory of Vertuous doings. Whereof innumerable examples might be alledged, if the thing were not so well known of it self, that it were much more against reason to doubt of it, than needfull to prove it. Therefore a man may truely conclude, that an History is the School-Mistris of Princes, at whose hand they may without paine, in way of pastime, and with singular pleasure learne the most part of the things that belong to their Office. Now, according to the diversity of the matter that it treateth of, or the order and manner of writing that it useth, it hath sundry names given unto it: but yet among the rest, there are two chiefe kindes. The one, which setteth downe mens doings and adventures at length, is called by the common name of an History: The other, which declareth their natures, sayings and manners, is properly named their Lives. And although the ground of them both do close very neare in one, yet doth the one respect more the Things, and the other the Persons: the one is more common, and the other more private: the one concerneth more the things that are without the man, and the other the things that proceed from within: The one, the events; the other, the consultations: between the which there is oftentimes great oddes, according to this answer of the Persian Siramnes, to such as marvelled how it came to passe, that his devices being so politicke, had so unhappy successe: It is (quoth he) because my devices are wholly from mine owne invention, but the effects of them are in the disposition of Fortune and the King. And surely among those that ever have taken upon them to write the Lives of Famous men, the chiefe prerogative, by the judgement of such as are clearest sighted, is justly given to the Greek Philosopher Plutarch, born in the City of Ch aeronea in the Countrey of Boeotia, a Noble man, perfect in all rare Knowledge, as his Workes may well put men out of doubt, if they list to reade them through, who all his life long, even to his old age, had to deal in affairs of the Common-weale, as he himselfe witnesseth in divers places, specially in the Treatise which he intituled , Whether an old man ought to meddle with the Government of a Common-weale or not: and who had the hap and Honour to be Schoolmaster to the Emperour Trajan, as is commonly beleeved, and as is expresly pretended in a certain Epistle set before the Latine translation of his matters of State, which (to say the truth) seemeth in my judgement to be somewhat suspicious, because I finde it not among his Workes in Greeke: besides that it speaketh as though the Booke were Dedicated to Trajan, which thing is manifestly disproved by the beginning of the Booke, and by divers other reasons. Yet notwithstanding, because methinkes it is sagely and gravely written, and well-beseeming him, I have set it down here in this place : Plutarch unto Trajan sendeth greeting: "I know well, that the modesty of your nature was not desirous of Soveraignty, though you have alwais endeavoured to deserve it by your Honourable conversation: by reason whereof you have been thought so much the worthier of it, as you have been found the further off from all ambition. And therefore I do now rejoyce in your Vertue and my Fortune, if it be so great as to cause you to administer that thing with Justice, which you have obtained by Desert. For otherwise, I am sure you have put your self inhazard of great danger, and me in perill of slanderous tongues, because that Rome cannot away with a wicked Emperour, and the common voice of the people is alwaies wont to cast the faults of the scholars in the teeth of their Schoolmasters: As for example , Seneca is railed upon by slanderous tongues, for the faults of his scholar Nero: The scapes of Quintilians young scholars, are imputed to Quintilian himself: and Socrates is blamed for being too milde to his hearers. But as for you, there is hope you shall do all things well enough, so you keep you as you are. If you first set your self in order, and then dispose all other things according to Vertue, all things shall fall out according to your desire. I have set you down the meanes in writing, which you must observe for the well Governing of your Common-weal, and have shewed unto you of how great force your behaviour may be in that behalfe. If you thinke good to follow these things, you have Plutarch for the director and guider of your life: if not, I protest unto you by this Epistle, that your falling into danger, to the overthrow of the Empire, is not by the Doctrine of Plutarch. This Epistle witnesseth plainly, that he was the Schoolmaster of Trajan, which thing seemeth to be avowed by this writing of Suidas: Plutarch being born in the City of Ch aeronea in Boeotia, was in the time of the Emperour Trajan, and somewhat before. But Trajan honoured him with the Dignity of Consulship, and commanded the Officers and Magistrates that were throughout all the Countrey of Illyria, that they should not do any thing without his Counsell and Authority. So doth Suidas write of him. And I am of opinion that Trajan being so wise an Emperour, would never have done him so great Honour, if he had not thought himself greatly beholding to him for some speciall cause. But the thing that maketh me most to beleeve it true, is, that the same goodnesse and justice appeared to be naturally imprinted in most of Trajans sayings and doings, whereof the pattern and mould (as a man may terme it) is cast and set down in Plutarchs Morals, so as men may perceive expresly, that the one could well skill to performe rightly, that which the other had taught wisely: For Dion writeth, that among other Honours which the Senate of Rome gave by Decree unto Trajan, they gave him the title of the Good Emperour. And Eutropius reporteth, that even unto his time, when a new Emperour came to be received of the Senate, among the cries of good handsell, and the wishes of good luck that were made unto him, one was; Happier be thou than Augustus, and better than Trajan. Howsoever the case stood, it is very certain that Plutarch Dedicated the collection of his Apophthegmes unto him. But when he had lived a long time in Rome, and was come home again to his own house, he fell to writing of this excellent Work of Lives, which he calleth Parallelon, as much to say, as a coupling or matching together, because he matcheth a Grecian with a Roman, setting down their Lives each after other, and Comparing them together, as he found any likenesse of Nature, Conditions, or Adventures betwixt them, and examining what the one of them had better or worser, greater or lesser than the other: which things he doth with so goodly and grave Discourse every where, taken out of the deepest and most hidden secrets of morall and naturall Philosophy, with so sage Precepts and fruitfull Instructions, with so effectuall commendation of vertue, and detestation of vice, with so many goodly allegations of other Authors, with so many fit comparisons, and with so many high inventions; that the Book may better be called by the Name of the Treasury of all rare and perfect Learning, than by any other name. Also it is said, that Theodorus Gaza, a Grecian of singular Learning, and a Worthy of the ancient Greece, being asked on a time by his familiar friends (which saw him so earnestly given to his study that he forgot all other things) what Author he had leverest choose, if he were at that point that he must needs choose some one to hold him to alone, did answer, that he would choose Plutarch; because that if they were all put together, there was no one both so profitable, and so pleasant to reade, as he . Sossius Senecio to whom he Dedicateth his worke, was a Senator of Rome, as witnesseth Dion, who writeth that the three persons whom Trajan most loved and honoured, were Sossius, Parma, and Celsus, insomuch that he caused Images of them to be set up. True it is that he wrote the Lives of many other men, which the spitefulnesse of the time hath bereft us of, among which he himselfe maketh mention of the Lives of Scipio Africanus, and Metellus Numidicus. And I have read a little Epistle of a sonne of his, whose name is not expressed, copied out of an old copy in the Library of St Marke in Venice, wherein he writeth to a friend of his, a Register of all the Books that his Father made: and there among the couples of Lives, he setteth down the Lives of Scipio and Epaminondas, and lastly, the Lives of Augustus C aesar, of Tiberius, of Caligula, of Claudius, of Nero, of Galba, of Vitellius, and of Otho. But having used all the diligence that I could in searching the chiefe Libraries of Venice and Rome, I could never finde them out. Onely I drew out certain diversities of readings, and many corrections, by conferring the old written Copies with the printed Books: which have stood me in great stead to the understanding of many hard places: and there are a great number of them which I have restored by conjecture, by the judgement and help of such men of this age, as are of greatest knowledge in Humane Learning. Yet for all this, there remain some places unamended, howbeit very few, because some lines were wanting in the Originall Copies, whereof (to my seeming) it was better for me to witnesse the want by marking it with some starre, than to guesse at it with all adventure, or to adde any thing to it. Now finally. If I have overshot my self in any thing, as it is very easie to do in so hard and long a Worke, specially to a man of so small ability as I am: I beseech the Readers to vouchsafe for my discharge, to admit the excuse which the Poet Horace giveth me, where he saith : A man may well be overseen In Workes that long and tedious been. Specially sith that of so many good men, and men of skill, as have heretofore set hand to the translating of it, there was never yet any one found, that went through with it in any Language, at leastwise that I have seen or heard of: and that such as have enterprised to translate it, specially into Latine, have evidently witnessed the hardnesse thereof, as they may easily perceive which list to conferre their Translations with mine. Nevertheless if it so fortune that men finde not the speech of this Translation so flowing, as they have found some other of mine, that are abroad in mens hands: I beseech the Readers to consider, that the office of a fit Translator consisith not onely in the faithfull expressing of his Authours meaning, but also in a certain resembling, and shadowing out of the form of his style, and the manner of his speaking: unlesse they will commit the errour of some Painters, who having taken upon them to draw a man lively, do paint him long where he should be short, and grosse where he should be slender, and yet set out the resemblance of his countenance naturally. For how harsh or rude soever my speech be, yet am I sure that my Translation will be much easier to my Countrymen, than the Greeke Copy is, even to such as are best practised in the Greek Tongue, by reason of Plutarchs peculiar manner of inditing, which is rather sharp, learned, and short, than plain, polished, and easie. At the hardest, although I have not compassed my matters so happily as ye would have wished and desired: yet do I hope that your Lordships in reading it will hold the parties good will excused, which hath taken such pains in doing of it to profit you. And if my labour be so happy as to content you, God be praised for it, which hath given me the grace to finish it.
