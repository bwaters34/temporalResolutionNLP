than was Emmekyne harte glad and she arose and went with the dyuell to shertegen bosshe warde & when they were come there they toke theyr ynne and abode there a great whyle / and made good chere with reuelynge and daunsynge and payde for heuery man that cam in theyr company that eate and dranke with them and wolde nat let them spende a halfe penny. grijsbyche. As Mary that nowe is called Eemekyn was so longe oute & cam nat home to hyr vnkyll he meruayled greatlye where that she was become than sayde he to his selfe I bad hyr if that it were late or she had done that she shuld abyde with hyr aunte in Nemmegen and slepe there all nyght but I wyll goo see for I were sory that she shulde myscarye nowe synes I haue browght hyr vp of a chylde but yonge women be anone entreated than wente syr grijsberche to Nemmegen to his systers howse and whan that he was there he asked for Mary his cosen / & hys syster answered hym knappshelye I wot nere were she is / Than sayde hyr broder syster ye mocke wt me / than sayde his syster it is more than .x. dayes a goo she cam to me with a dronken face and prayed that she myght haue a bed that nyght and I bad hyr that she shuld goo to the place where that she had drounken all ye day before / And by cause I sayde those wordes she ranne out of the dores I wot nere where Than sayde the vnkyll alas where is that mayde become / Than sayde his syster at the wyne tauerne there shall ye fynde hyr drynkyng wt good felowes / Than sayde the pryste alas syster ye make my harte colde to here those wordes that you speke / his syster sayde if that she hath be broched she shall be the esyar for a nother & she shall neuer halte therof / Than wente the pryste fro his syster wt a heuye harte when that he harde hyr speke in that manere & culde here no tydynges of Mary his coseyne. And in ye meane tyme dyd the Iayler that kepte the pryso that the olde duke was in let hym out of pryson and they fled bothe to the towne of shertege bosshe where that they were honorabely reseyued of the Lordes of the same towne and great ioye mas made for his delyuerye with great tryumphe that culde be made / within a wyle tydynges cam vnto marys aunt howe that the olde Duke was delyuered out of pryson & was in the towne of shertegen bosshe / this herynge marys aunte was very angerye therwith and she was so angery therwith that she swelled that she had almoste burste and the cared she nat what she had done to hyr selfe and than the dyuell that is at all tymes reddye temped hyr to cut hyr owne throte & at the laste he teped hyr so muche yt i hyr anger she toke a knyfe and cut hyr owne throte / Than was the dyuell glad & toke the sowle and bare it to hell to euer lastynge payne. Whan Emmekyn and Satan had dwelled a good whyle in shertege bosshe that is a fayer towne / then departed they fro thense and went towarde Anwarpe to gyder / & when they were at Anwarpe tha sayd Satan to Emmekyn nowe be we come to Anwarpe nowe let vs goo to the gylde tre on the market place and there wyll we reuell and playe and spare for no coste and for a pot of Romneye there shall ye see neuer thryftes that spede theyr fryndes goodes that bene deed and also there shall ye see the syngyll women that they kepe and also there shall ye see braggers & bosters & pyckers of quarels / and also theues and farers for moneye. and aboue syt the Burgeses of the towne that had leuer take money than for to gyue money Tha sayde Emmekyn good Satan let vs goo thyder and see that pastyme for that is the thynge that I reioyce moste in and loue beste to see Than sayde Satan to Emmeken with a good wyll / than departed they to the gylden tre and whe that they were come then sat they downe and called for a pot of wyne / tha sat there .ij. fellowes i a nother sete therby that sawe Emmekyn syt by Satan than sayde the one to the other / se what a fayer woman syttethe ouer ageynste vs with a yong fellowe that hath but one yee I merueyll what great fantasy that fayre mayde hath vnto hym we wyll goo take our pot and goo syt by hym / and also take hyr fro hym tha arose the benchewystelers and cam and sat downe by Satan wt the one yee and sayd to hym by your leue may we syt by you / Than sayd satan ye with a good wyll & ye be welcome take the pot and drynke with vs I praye you / Than answered the benshewystelers we thake you hartelye we haue of our owne than as they were set and talked / tha sayde Emmekyn my loue Satan were it nat gemetrye that I shuld tell howe many droppes of wyne were in the pot / wha the benshewystelers harde hyr saye so they sayde to hyr that were a thynge vnpossyble & a thynge to meruayle of greatly / Than sayd satan to the benshewystylers she can do it wele and greater thynges tha that is for she can the .vij. free scyences I durste let hyr slyp for to despute with the beste docture in all Parys or Louen / Than sayde the benshewystelers to Satan I praye the good fellowe yt thou wylt desyre hyr for to do that wonderly scyance that we may see hyr doo it / and eche of vs shall gyue vnto you a pot of wyne before & moreouer if there be any man that wyll say the cotrary we wyll be auenged on them / Than sayd Satan to the fellowes say ye that than shall she do it before you and than sayd he to Emmekyn Emmekyn my loue ye muste shewe vnto these good fellowes howe many dropes of wyne be i the pot as ye dyd promyse them for to do yesterday and they wyll gyue vnto you for your Laboure / tha sayde Emmekyn whyle that I must nedes shewe vnto you that poynte of iemotrye than muste ye all kepe our pece & speke no more / for rethoryke wyll be harde / and as Emmekyn had spoke these wordes & that it was knowne i the towne there cam many folkes for to see it to knowe whether that she culde do it or no / & whe that Satan sawe that there were manye men gathered for to see it / than thowght he yt he wolde goo & sett some of them togyther by the eres so that one of them myght kyll another / than teped he two or .iij. so muche yt they fell to gyther by the eres so that there was one slayne and he that had done ye dede was tane and also behedhed wherof satan greatly reiosed and was glad and sayde to hym selfe this is well practysed of me for there is nowe .ij. deed / and in this maner dwelled Satan and Emmekyn at the guylden ire at Anwarpe beinge in the merket place and made reuell and mysse rule longe tyme / so that thorowghe the dyuell temptacyon there were many men slayue for Emmekyns sake wherin the dyuell reioysed and was glad and sayd this is a very good lodgyng for me I culde nat haue founde a better in all Anwarpe than this is for nowe shall I worke many wonders if that we abyde here a whyle lenger for by me shall be a great many sowles browght to hell and I shall make many a one for to lese his lyfe thorowghe my temptacyon of them & therfore were I lothe for to departe fro this loggyng / for there be many that I may take in my snare as men may take a byrde that can nat flye and here shall I fynde suche at all tymes in this howse / and I wyll goo to my hoste and by my borde of hym by the moneth as longe as I tary here / and than shall I be reddy at all tymes for to make chydynge & brawlynge and set them to gyther by the eres / and make one stycke a nother so yt or it be a yere paste I shall make me a phisicyan or a sothe sayer so that ye people shall come and seke to me for counsayle & by that maner shall I brynge more than a thowsande sowles into hell if that I am nat let my mayster Ihu. As Emmekyn had dwelled at Anwarpe a good whyle she began to marke yt she lyued vycyousely & synfully and for hyr sake that many men were murdered by the dyuyll falsehed and sayde O it forthynkethe me my synfull lyuynge and to for sake the ioyes of heuen and goo the ryght way to euerlastynge perdycyon / nowe perseyue I well that this Satan that is here wt me is the dyuyll thowghe that he wolde neuer tell it vnto me. O Aunte your spytefull wordes that ye sayd vnto me hath caused me yt I shall be vtterly dapned in the pyt of helle and if that nowe I shulde turne / I am afrayde that I haue ronne to ferre / and also I was wonte to worshyp our lady dayly with a prayer & nowe I haue nat done it of longe tyme / and sata wyll nat also suffer me also that I shulde do it & therfore may I se well that he is yt dyuyll / and nowe is it to late for me to take repentance / and nowe wyll I let all heuynes goo and make good chere for yender I see cum in the felashyp that promysed me yesterday to make good chere / & whe they were come than wen Emmekyn and sata and sat downe by them and made good chere & had forget all hyr heuynes & at the laste she fell at wordes with other men so that one of the fellowes had stycked a man / and when that was done sayde Satan to the fellowe that they two wolde goo without the towne and so they dyd. and as they were without the towne the dyuell spyed a man comynge than sayde the dyuell to ye fellowe yoder cometh a ma wt muche money let vs kyll hym and take the money fro hym & the dyuell temped hym so muche that he consented and when the man was come / The fellowe toke a dager and styked hym wherof the dyuell was glad and departed. As Satan and Emmeken had dwelled in Anwarpe by the space of .vi. yere at the syne of the gylden tre where that muche myschefe and maslawter was done thorowghe them / So on a tyme longed Emmekyn for to see hyr vnkyll and other kynsfolke yt she had in the lande of Gelder / than desyred she Satan yt he wold goo wt hyr to the lande of Gelder for to se howe yt my vnkyll and my aunte that knowe nat where that I am become for I knowe for a sertente that my vnkyl taketh great thowght for me for he loued me euer well and he hath wept for my sake many a tere / Than sayde Satan to his selfe this polle shorne pryste that prayeth a prayer to the woman yt is all in whyte yt lettethe me at all tyme that I may nat haue my purpose for & it were nat for his prayer that he sayeth I had or this tyme other a broke hyr arme / or a legge / or els hyr necke Than sayd Emmekyn Satan what saye you to your selfe in that maner / than sayd Sata vnto hyr I say no other thynge but as ye wyll so am I contente to goo / than payed Satan the hoste all theyr costes so that the hoste was well content and thanked them hartely of theyr good payment than toke Satan leue and departed to Nemmege in the lade of Gelders / and when they were come to Nemmegyn it fortuned on the same that it was the dilycacyon of a chyrche / & when they were within the Towne than sayde Emmekyn to Satan let vs goo see howe my aunte dothe / than sayde Satan ye nede nat to go to hyr for she is deed more than a yere a goo / than sayd Ememekyn is it trewth / tha sayd satan ye / than sayd Emmekyn to ye dyuell what do all yender folkes yt be yender gathered than sayde the dyuell the play a play yt is wont euery yere to be played / than sayde Emmekyn good loue let vs goo here it for I haue harde my vnkyll say often tymes that a play were better than a sermant to some folke / than sayde the dyuell to Emmekyn what lye ye on me to see the play let vs goo to the Tauerne and make good chere tha sayd Emmekyn good satan let vs go here it / than sayde Satan wyle that ye wolde so fayne here it go thyder and here it but tarry no lenger than I shall call you / than went Emmekyn and harde the playe and the playe was of synfull lyuynge and there she sawe hyr lyuyng played be fore hyr face than she began to be sory and take repentance / than called the dyuell hyr for he wolde haue hyr here it nat oute / But she wolde nat come / for by the play she was all hole turned fro hyr mysse lyuynge & sayde. O good lorde haue mercy on me pore wretche & synner / I am nat wordy to trede vpon the erthe and I am afrayde yt I haue ronne so ferre / than sayde the dyuyll to his selfe all my laboure is loste she taketh vnto hyr hole repentance and sayd vnto Emmekyn what ayle ye nowe be ye mad / Let be your wepynge and sorowe and let vs goo to the tauerne and make good chere & put a waye your sorowe / than sayde Emmekyn go fro me thou false fynde woo be to the that euer thou ca to me and I repente me that euer I chose the for my paramour for by ye I am vtterly dampned with out the more mercy of god / than arose the dyuyll fro the growne and sayde holde your peace and be styll or elles I shall bere the with me to euerlastynge payne / Than sayd Emmekyn O good Lorde haue mercy on me / and defende me from the handes of the dyuyll that he do to me no harme. Than sayde the dyuell vnto hyr I see it wyll be no better tha toke he Emmekyn in his clawes & caryed hyr vp into ye ayer more hygher than ony stepyll that hyr vnkyll and al the people meruayled therat / howe it cam that she was caryed so sodenly vppe. downe and howe that hyr vnkyll sawe it. As Satan the Dyuyll had borne Emmekyn vp into the ayer than caste he hyr fro thense downe wenyng to haue broke hyr necke but god and our Lady wolde nat suffer it / & she fell in the strete before all ye people wherof they yt were there preset were sore a basshed & a frayde and also there was hyr Unkyll that harde the same playe that sawe hyr also fall but he knewe nat that it was his cousyn than went ye people to hyr as faste as they myght / asaynge if yt hyr necke were nat broke / than cam a burgeys of ye towne to syr ghijsbryche and asked hym if that he wolde goo and see whether that she had broke hyr necke or no and he sayd with a good wyl than went the burgeyes and he to Emmekyn & when they were come then asked ye burgeyse if she had nat broke hyr necke and they sayde no than sayd syr ghijssbryche that is a great meruayle let me come see hyr / tha went hyr vnkyll to hyr and when that he sawe hyr he sayde alas it is my coseyne I haue sowght hyr by the space of .vij. yere longe and neuer culde fynde hyr / and as Emmekyn had layne a good space in a sownde / than began she a lyttell to come to hyr selfe and than harde she hyr vnkyll speke to hyr whiche she knewe well by the voyce and sayde / O vnkyll what is me be fall / where haue I be & where am I nowe / O good lorde I pray ye haue mercy on me that I may be saued and come to euerlastyng lyfe / for had nat your mercyfulnes a kepte me here the dyuell had caryed me bothe body & sowle to euerlastynge payne. than sayd hyr vnkyl to hyr a good cosayne howe fortuned this than sayd Emmekyn vnkyll I wolde that I were in the same case that I was in whe that I dwelt wt you but nowe I am dapned / hyr vnkyll sayd say nat so good cosen for there is no body loste with out the fall in despayer but I pray you showe vnto me howe that it hapened that ye were caryed so hygh in the ayer as ye were / than sayde Emmekyn good vnkyll I shall tell to you all togyther / on a tyme as I sat vnder a hegge whe that I departed fro my Aunte I gaue my selfe vnto the dyuel and he cam vnto me and I went wt hym and dwelled with hym this vij. yere longe and in that tyme haue there many wonders be done & on a tyme I desyred hym to goo see you and when that we were here I desyred hym that I myght here this play / and by this play was I couerted wherwt ye dyuell was angery and toke me and bare me into the ayer and caste me downe amonges these folke / than sayd hyr vnkyll was the dyuell with you good coseyne / than sayde Emmekyn I was at his comaundement this .vij. yere / than sayde hyr vnkylle that geste muste we rydde fro you and se whether that we can get the mercye of God by our prayer. Whe ye dyuel harde those wordes he sayd yt shalt thou nat haue pore for to do for I wyll whe it please me caraye hyr body & sowle to the pyt of hell / than sayde hyr vnkell that shal I let ye than coungered he hym yt he culde tepte hyr no more than went hyr vnkyll to the deaco and coplayned but Emmekyn sayd she trusted to be saued and than went he to ye moste lerned of all Nemmegen and asked counsayll of them / but as they harde the synne there was none so well lerned / so holy or deuoute that duste take apon them to absoyle hyr of them and gyue vnto hyr pennance accordynge to hyr synnes / wherof they were ryght heuy / and so departed Emmekyn and hyr vnkyll a way with heuy hartes.
