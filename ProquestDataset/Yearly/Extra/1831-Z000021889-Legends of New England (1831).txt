The field is a new one---and I have but partially explored it. New-England is rich in traditionary lore---a thousand associations of superstition and manly daring and romantic adventure, are connected with her green hills and her pleasant rivers. I leave the task of rescuing these associations from oblivion to some more fortunate individual; and if this little volume shall have the effect to induce such an effort, I shall at least be satisfied, whatever may be the judgment of the public upon my own humble production. I have in many instances alluded to the superstition and bigotry of our ancestors--- the rare and bold race who laid the foundation of this republic; but no one can accuse me of having done injustice to their memories. A son of New-England, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-009.jpg) \- external link  - Preface v. ] proud of my birth-place, I would not willingly cast dishonor upon its founders.--- My feelings in this respect, have already been expressed, in language, which I shall be pardoned I trust for introducing in this place: Oh---never may a son of thine, Where'e his wandering steps incline, Forget the sky which bent above His childhood like a dream of love--- The stream beneath the green hill flowing--- The broad-armed trees above it growing--- The clear breeze through the foliage blowing:--- Or, hear unmoved the taunt of scorn, Breathed o'er the brave New-England born; Or mark the stranger's Jaguar hand Disturb the ashes of thy dead--- The buried glory of a land Whose soil with noble blood is red, And sanctified in every part, Nor feel resentment, like a brand, Unsheathing from his fiery heart! An apology is even in worse taste than a preface; but I would simply state that this volume was written during the anxieties and perplexing cares attendant upon the management of a political and literary periodical.

At first view, it would seem like the mysterious transformations of a dream, or like the strange mutations of sunset-clouds upon the face of the Summer Heavens. One hundred years ago!---The Oak struck its roots deeply in the Earth, and tossed its branches loftily in the sunshine, where now the voice of industry and enterprise rises in one perpetual murmur. The shadows of the forest lay brown and heavily, where now the village church-spire overtops the dwellings clustered about it. Instead of the poor, dependent and feeble colonists of Britain, we are now a nation of ourselves--- a people, great and prosperous and happy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] And those who battled with our fathers, or smoked the pipe of peace in their dwellings, where are they? Where is the mighty people which, but a little time ago, held dominion over this fair land, from the great lakes to the Ocean? Go to the hunting grounds of Miantonimoh and Annawon---to the royal-homes of Massasoit and Metacom and Sassacus, and ask for the traces and the memorials of the iron race of warriors, who wrestled with the pale Yengeese even unto death. There will perhaps remain the ruin of their ancient forts---the fragments of their ragged pottery---the stone-heads of their scattered arrows; and, here and there, on their old battle-fields, the white bones of their slain. And these will be all---all that remain to tell of the cherished race of hunters and warriors. The Red Man has departed forever. The last gleam of his Council-fire has gone up from amidst the great oaks of the forest, and the last ripple of his canoe vanished from the pleasant waters bosomed among them. His children are hastening towards the setting of the Sun; and the plough-share of the stranger is busy among the bones of his fathers. One hundred years ago!---The hunter, who ranged the hills and the forests of New-England, fought against other enemies, than the brown bear and the panther. The husbandman, as he toiled in the plain. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] or the narrow clearing, kept closely at his side a loaded weapon; and wrought diligently and firmly in the midst of peril. The frequent crack of the Indian's rifle was heard in the still lepths of the forest---the death-knell of the unwary hunter; and, ever and anon, the flame of some devoted farm-house, whose dwellers had been slaughtered by a merciless foe, rose redly upon the darkness of the night-time. The wild, and fierce eyes of the heathen gleamed through the thick underwood of the forest, upon the passing by of the worshippers of the only true God; and the war-whoop rang shrill and loud under the very walls of the sanctuary of prayer. Perhaps no part of New-England affords a wider field for the researches of the Legendary, than that portion of Massachusetts Bay, formerly known as the province of Maine. There, the ferocious Norridgewock held his stern councils, and there the tribes of the Penobscot went forth with song and dance to do battle upon the white man. There, the romantic and chivalrous Castine immured himself in the forest solitudes, and there the high-hearted Ralle---the mild and gifted Jesuit---gathered together the broken strength of the Norridgewock, and built up in the great wilderness a temple to the true God. There too, he perished in the dark onslaught of the Colonists--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] perished with many wounds, at the very foot of the Cross, which his own hands had planted. And there, the Norridgewocks fell---one after another---in stern and uncomplaining pride---neither asking, nor giving quarter, as they resisted the white spoiler upon the threshold of their consecrated place of worship; and in view of their wives and their children. The following is one among many legends of the strange rencounters of the While Man and the Indian, which are yet preserved in the ancient records and traditions of Maine. The simple and unvarnished narrative is only given. It was a sultry evening towards the last of June, 1722, that Capt. Harmon and his Eastern rangers, urged their canoes up the Kennebeck River, in pursuit of their savage enemies. For hours they toiled diligently at the oar.---The last trace of civilization was left behind, and the long shadows of the skirting forests met and blended in the middle of the broad stream, which wound darkly through them. At every sound from the adjacent shores---the rustling wing of some night-bird, or the quick footsteps of some wild beast---the dash of the oar was suspended, and the ranger's grasp tightened on his rifle. All knew the peril of the enterprise; and that silence, which is natural to men, who feel themselves in the extreme of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] mortal jeopardy, settled like a cloud upon the midnight adventurers. "Hush---softly men!" said the watchful Harmon, in a voice, which scarcely rose above a hoarse whisper, as his canoe swept round a ragged promontory, "there is a light ahead!" All eyes were bent towards the shore. A tall Indian fire gleamed up amidst the great oaks, casting a red and strong light upon the dark waters. For a single and breathless moment the operation of the oar was suspended; and every ear listened with painful earnestness to catch the well known sounds, which seldom failed to indicate the propinquity of the savages. But all was now silent. With slow and faint movements of the oar, the canoes gradually approached the suspected spot. The landing was effected in silence. After moving cautiously for a considerable distance in the dark shadow, the party at length ventured within the broad circle of the light, which at first attracted their attention. Harmon was at their head, with an eye and a hand, quick as those of the savage enemy whom he sought. The body of a fallen tree lay across the path. As the rangers were on the point of leaping over it, the hoarse whisper of Harmon again broke the silence. "God of Heaven!" he exclaimed, pointing to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] tree---"See here!---'tis the work of the cursed red skins!" A smothered curse growled on the lips of the rangers, as they bent grimly forward in the direction pointed out by their commander. Blood was sprinkled on the rank grass, and a human hand---the hand of a white man,---lay on the bloody log! There was not a word spoken, but every countenance worked with terrible emotion. Had the rangers followed their own desperate inclination, they would have hurried recklessly onward to the work of vengeance; but the example of their leader, who had regained his usual calmness and self-command, prepared them for a less speedy, but more certain triumph. Cautiously passing over the fearful obstacle in the pathway, and closely followed by his companions, he advanced stealthily and cautiously upon the light, hiding himself and his party as much as possible behind the thick trees. In a few moments they obtained a full view of the object of their search. Stretched at their length, around a huge fire, but at a convenient distance from it, lay the painted and half naked forms of twenty savages. It was evident from their appearance, that they had passed the day in one of their horrid revels, and that they were now suflering under the effects of intoxication. Occasionally, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] grim warrior among them started half upright, grasping his tomahawk, as if to combat some vision of his disordered brain, but, unable to shake off the stupor from his senses, uniformly fell back into his former position. The rangers crept nearer. As they bent their keen eyes along their well-tried rifles, each felt perfectly sure of his aim. They waited for the signal of Harmon, who was endeavoring to bring his long musket to bear upon the head of the most distant of the savages. "Fire!" he at length exclaimed, as the sight of his piece interposed full and distinct between his eye and the wild scalp-lock of the Indian. "Fire, and rush on!" The sharp voice of thirty rifles thrilled through the heart of the forest. There was a groan---a smothered cry---a wild and convulsive movement among the sleeping Indians; and all again was silent. The rangers sprang forward with their clubbed muskets and hunting knives; but their work was done. The red men had gone to their last audit before the Great Spirit; and no sound was heard among them, save the gurgling of the hot blood from their lifeless bosoms. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] They were left unburied on the place of their revelling,--- a prey to the foul birds of the air, and the revenous beasts of the wilderness. Their scalps were borne homeward in triumph by the successful rangers, whose children and grand-children shuddered, long after, at the thrilling narration of the midnight adventure. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] [ The fearful delusion of Witchcraft was principally confined to the county of Essex, in Massachusetts---although there were instances of it in other portions of New-England. It was there that the evil had its most powerful work. It was like a heavy judgment from God---the visitation of an indescribable and unaccounted for curse---the passing over of a shadow upon the mental atmosphere like that of a thunder-cloud upon the physical The following story is founded on a passage in the singular works of Cotton Mather, where that learned divine informs us that at the dead of night, the "witches and prestigious spirits and demons," who persecuted, by means of their spells and incantations, the good people of Massachusetts Bay, were assembled together by the sound of a great trumpet. The place of the evil gathering was somewhere near Naumkeag, now Salem.] A trumpet in the darkness blown--- A peal upon the air--- The church-yard answers to its tone With boding shriek and wail and groan--- The dead are gliding there! It rose upon the still midnight, A summons long and clear--- The wakeful shuddered with affright--- The dreaming sleeper sprang upright, And pressed his stunning ear. The Indian, where his serpent eye Beneath the green-wood shone, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] Started, and tossed his arms on high, And answered, with his own wild cry, The sky's unearthly tone. The wild birds rose in startled flocks, As the long trumpet swelled; And loudly from their old, grey rocks, The gaunt, fierce wolf, and caverned fox In mutual terror yelled. There is a wild and haunted glen, 'Twixt Saugus and Naumkeag--- 'Tis said of old that wizard-men And demons to that spot have been To consecrate their league. A fitting place for such as these--- That small and sterile plain, So girt about with tall, old trees Which rock and groan in every breeze, Like spirits cursed with pain. It was the witch's trysting place--- The wizard's chosen ground, Where the accursed of human race With demons gathered, face to face. By the midnight trumpet's sound. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] And there that night the trumpet rang, And rock and hill replied, And down the glen strange shadows sprang. Mortal and fiend---a wizard gang--- Seen dimly side by side. They gathered there from every land That sleepeth in the sun,--- They came with spell and charm in hand, Waiting their Master's high command--- Slaves to the Evil One! From islands of the far-off seas--- From Hecla's ice and flame--- From where the loud and savage breeze Growls through the tall Norwegian trees, Seer, witch and wizard came! And, from the sunny land of palms, The negro hag was there--- The Gree-gree, with his Obi charms--- The Indian, with his tattooed arms, And wild and streaming hair! The Gipsey with her fierce, dark eyes, The worshipper of flame--- The searcher out of mysteries, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] Above a human sacrifice--- All---all---together came! Nay, look not down that lighted dell, Thou startled traveller!--- Thy christian eye should never dwell On gaunt, grey witch and fiend of hell And evil Trumpeter! But, the traveller turned him from his way, For he heard the revelling--- And saw the red light's wizard ray Among the dark leafed branches play, Like an unholy thing. He knelt him on the rocks, and cast, A fearful glance beneath,--- Wizard and hag before him passed, Each wilder, fiercer than the last,--- His heart grew cold as death! He saw the dark-browed Trumpeter, In human shape was he; And witch and fiend and sorcerer, With shriek and laugh and curses, were Assembled at his knee. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] And lo---beneath his straining glance, A light form stole along--- Free, as if moving to the dance, He saw her fairy steps advance Towards the evil throng. The light along her forehead played--- A wan, unearthly glare; Her cheek was pale beneath the shade The wildness of her tresses made, Yet nought of fear was there! Now God have mercy on thy brain, Thou stricken traveller!--- Look on thy victim once again, Bethink thee of her wrongs and pain--- Dost thou remember her? The traveller smote his burning brow, For he saw the wronged one there--- He knew her by her forehead's snow, And by her large, blue eye below, And by her wild, dark hair. Slowly, yet firm she held her way,--- The wizard's song grew still--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] The sorcerer left his elvish play, And hideous imp and beldame grey Waited the stranger's will. A voice came up that place of fear--- The Trumpeter's hoarse tone--- "Speak---who art thou that comest here With brow baptized and christian car, Unsummoned and alone?" One moment---and a tremor shook Her light and graceful frame,--- It passed---and then her features took A fiercer and a haughtier look, As thus her answer came:--- "Spirits of evil--- Workers of doom! Lo---to your revel, For vengeance I come! Vengeance on him Who hath blighted my fame,--- Fill his cup to the brim With a curse without name? Let his false heart inherit The madness of mine, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] And I yield ye my spirit, And bow at your shrine!" A sound---a mingled laugh and yell, Went howling fierce and far--- A redder light shone through the dell, As if the very gates of hell Swung suddenly ajar. "Breathe then thy curse, thou daring one," A low, deep voice replied--- "Whate'er thou askest shall be done, The burthen of thy doom upon The false one shall abide." The maiden stood erect---her brow Grew dark as those around her, As burned upon her lip that vow Which christian ear may never know,--- And the dark fetter bound her! Ay, there she stood---the holy Heaven Was looking down on her--- An Angel from her bright home driven--- A spirit lost and doomed and given To fiend and sorcerer! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] And changed---how changed!---her aspect grew Fearful and elvish there; The warm tinge from her cheek withdrew, And one dark spot of blood-red hue Burned on her forehead fair. Wild from her eye of madness shone The baleful fire within, As, with a shrill and lifted tone She made her fearful purpose known, Before the powers of Sin: "Let my curse be upon him--- The faithless of heart! Let the smiles that have won him In frowning depart!--- Let his last, cherished blossom Of sympathy die, And the hopes of his bosom In shadows go by!--- Ay, curse him---but keep The poor boon of his breath, 'Till he sigh for the sleep, And the quiet of death! Let a viewless one haunt him With whisper and jeer, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] And an evil one daunt him With phantoms of fear!--- Be the fiend unforgiving That follows his tread; Let him walk with the living--- Yet gaze on the dead!" She ceased.---The doomed one felt the spell Already on his brain; He turned him from the wizard-dell; He prayed to Heaven; he cursed at hell;--- He wept---and all in vain. The night was one of mortal fear; The morning rose to him, Dark as the shroudings of a bier, As if the blessed atmosphere, Like his own soul, was dim. He passed among his fellow men, With wild and dreamy air, For, whispering in his ear again The horrors of the midnight glen, The demon found him there. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] And, when he would have knelt and prayed, Amidst his household band, An unseen power his spirit stayed, And on his moving lip was laid A hot and burning hand! The lost one in the solitude Of dreams he gazed upon, And, when the holy morning glowed, Her dark eye shone---her wild hair flowed Between him and the sun! His brain grew wild,---and then he died; Yet, ere his heart grew cold, To the gray priest, who at his side The strength of prayer and blessing tried, His fearful tale was told. They've bound the witch with many a thong--- The holy priest is near her; And ever as she moves along, A murmur rises hoarse and strong From those who hate and fear her. She's standing up for sacrifice, Beneath the gallows-tree;--- The silent town beneath her lies, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] Above her are the Summer skies--- Far off---the quiet sea. So young---so frail---so very fair--- Why should the victim die?--- Look on her brow!---the red stain there Burns underneath her tangled hair--- And mark her fiery eye! A thousand eyes are looking up In scorn and hate to her;--- A bony hand hath coiled the rope, And yawns upon the green hill's slope The witch's sepulchre! Ha! she hath spurned both priest and book--- Her hand is tossed on high--- Her curse is loud,---she will not brook The impatient crowd's abiding look--- Hark!---how she shrieks to die! Up---up---one struggle---all is done! One groan---the deed is wrought. Wo---for the wronged and fallen one! Her corse is blackening in the sun--- Her spirit---trace it not!

The place of the execution of the witches and wizards of the neighborhood of Salem is a naked hill, which overlooks the town and harbor. The tree from which they were suspended, was standing a few years since, blasted and dead with years---the heart of the wood only visible, like a gaunt skeleton, blackened by exposure to sun and storm. "Until my ghastly tale is told This heart within me burns." Rime of the Ancient Mariner . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] During a delightful excursion in the vicinity of the Green Mountains, a few years since, I had the good fortune to meet with a singular character, known in many parts of Vermont as the Rattlesnake Hunter, It was a warm, clear day of sunshine, in the middle of June that I saw him for the first time, while engaged in a mineralogical ramble among the hills. His head was bald, and his forehead was deeply marked with the strong lines of care and age. His form was wasted and meagre; and, but for the fiery vigor of his eye, he might have been supposed incapacitated by age and infirmities for even a slight exertion. Yet he hurried over the rude ledges of rock with a quick and almost youthful tread; and seemed earnestly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] searching among the crevices and loose crags and stinted bushes around him. All at once, he started suddenly---drew himself back with a sort of shuddering recoil---and then smote fiercely with his staff upon the rock before him. Another, and another blow,--- and he lifted the lithe and crushed form of a large Rattlesnake upon the end of his rod. The old man's eye glistened but his lip trembled, as he looked steadfastly upon his yet writhing victim. "Another of the cursed race!" he muttered, between his clenched teeth, apparently unconscious of my presence. I was now satisfied that the person before me was none other than the famous Rattlesnake Hunter. He was known throughout the neighborhood as an outcast, and a wanderer, obtaining a miserable subsistence from the casual charities of the people around him. His time was mostly spent among the rocks and rude hills, where his only object seemed to be the hunting out and destroying of the dreaded Crotalus horridus  , or Rattlesnake. I immediately determined to satisfy my curiosity, which had been strangely excited by the remarkable appearance and behavior of the stranger; and for this purpose I approached him. "Are there many of these reptiles in this vicinity?" I enquired, pointing to the crushed serpent. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] "They are getting to be scarce," said the old man, lifting his slouched hat and wiping his bald brow; "I have known the time when you could hardly stir ten rods from your door in this part of the State without hearing their low, quick rattle at your side, or seeing their many-colored bodies coiling up in your path. But, as I said before, they are getting to be scarce--- the infernal race will be extinct in a few years;---and thank God, I have myself been a considerable cause of their extermination." "You must, of course, know the nature of these creatures perfectly well," said I. "Do you believe in their power of fascination or charming?" The old man's countenance fell. There was a visible struggle of feeling within him; for his lip quivered, and he dashed his brown hand suddenly across his eyes, as if to conceal a tear. But quickly recovering himself, he answered in the low, deep voice of one about to reveal some horrible secret--- "I believe in the Rattlesnake's power of fascination as firmly as I believe in my own existence." "Surely," said I, "you do not believe that they have power over human beings?" "I do---I know it to be so!"---and the old man trembled as he spoke.---"You are a stranger to me," he said slowly, after scrutinizing my features for a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] moment,---"but if you will go down with me to the foot of this rock, in the shade there"---and he pointed to a group of leaning oaks that hung over the declivity--- "I will tell you a strange and sad story of my own experience." It may be supposed that I readily assented to this proposal. Bestowing one more blow on the rattlesnake, as if to be certain of his death, the old man descended the rocks with a rapidity, which would have endangered the neck of a less practiced hunter. After reaching the spot which he had pointed out, the Rattlesnake Hunter commenced his story in a manner which confirmed what I had previously heard of his education and intellectual strength. "I was among the earliest settlers in this part of the country. I had just finished my education at the University of Harvard, when I was induced, by the flattering representations of some of the earlier pioneers into the wild lands beyond the Connecticut, to seek my fortune in the new settlements. My wife"--- the old man's eye glistened an instant, and then a tear crossed his brown cheek---"my wife accompanied me, young and delicate and beautiful as she was, to this wild and rude country. I shall never forgive myself for bringing her hither---never. "Young man," he continued, "you look like one who could pity me.--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] You shall see the image of the girl who followed me to the new country." And he unbound, as he spoke, a ribbon from his neck, with a small miniature attached to it. It was that of a beautiful female. She might have been twenty years of age---but there was an almost childish expression in her countenance,---a softness--- a delicacy, and a sweetness of smile, which I have seldom seen in the features of those who have tasted, even slightly, of the bitter waters of existence. The old man watched my countenance intently, as I surveyed the image of his early love. "She must have been very beautiful," I said, as I returned the picture. "Beautiful!" he repeated, "you may well say so. But this avails nothing. I have a fearful story to tell: would to God I had not attempted it; but I will go on. My heart has been stretched too often on the rack of memory to suffer any new pang." "We had resided in the new country nearly a year. Our settlements had increased rapidly; and the comforts and delicacies of life were beginning to be felt, after the weary privations, and severe trials to which we had been subjected. The red men were few and feeble, and did not molest us. The beasts of the forest and mountain were ferocious, but we suffered little from them. The only immediate danger to which we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] were exposed resulted from the Rattlesnakes which infested our neighborhood. Three or four of our settlers were bitten by them, and died in terrible agonies. The Indians often told us frightful stories of this snake, and its powers of fascination, and although they were generally believed, yet for myself, I confess, I was rather amused than convinced by their marvellous legends. "In one of my hunting excursions abroad, on a fine morning---it was just at this time of the year---I was accompanied by my wife. 'Twas a beautiful morning. The sunshine was warm, but the atmosphere was perfectly clear; and a fine breeze from the northwest shook the bright, green leaves which clothed to profusion the wreathing branches above us. I had left my companion for a short time, in pursuit of game; and in climbing a rugged ledge of rocks, interspersed with shrubs and dwarfish trees, I was startled by a quick, grating rattle. I looked forward. On the edge of a loosened rock lay a large Rattlesnake, coiling himself, as if for the deadly spring. He was within a few feet of me; and I paused for an instant to survey him. I know not why, but I stood still, and looked at the deadly serpent with a strange feeling of curiosity. Suddenly he unwound his coil, as if relenting from his purpose of hostility, and raising his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] head, he fixed his bright, fiery eye directly upon my own. A chilling and indescribable sensation totally different from any thing I had ever before experienced, followed this movement of the serpent; but I stood still, and gazed steadily and earnestly, for at that moment there was a visible change in the reptile.--- His form seemed to grow larger, and his colors brighter. His body moved with a slow, almost imperceptible motion towards me, and a low hum of music came from him---or, at least, it sounded in my ear---a strange, sweet melody, faint as that which melts from the throat of the Humming-bird. Then the tints of his body deepened, and changed and glowed, like the changes of a beautiful kaleidoscope,--- green, purple and gold, until I lost sight of the serpent entirely, and saw only wild and curiously woven circles of strange colors, quivering around me, like an atmosphere of rainbows. I seemed in the centre of a great prism---a world of mysterious colors;---and the tints varied and darkened and lighted up again around me; and the low music went on without ceasing, until my brain reeled; and fear, for the first time, came like a shadow over me. The new sensation gained upon me rapidly, and I could feel the cold sweat gushing from my brow. I had no certainty of danger in my mind---no definite ideas of peril---all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] was vague and clouded, like the unaccountable terrors of a dream,---and yet my limbs shook, and I fancied I could feel the blood stiffening with cold as it passed along my veins. I would have given worlds to have been able to tear myself from the spot---I even attempted to do so, but the body obeyed not the impulse of the mind---not a muscle stirred; and I stood still, as if my feet had grown to the solid rock, with the infernal music of the tempter in my ear, and the baleful colorings of his enchantment before me. Suddenly a new sound came on my ear---it was a human voice---but it seemed strange and awful. Again--- again---but I stirred not; and then a white form plunged before me, and grasped my arm. The horrible spell was at once broken. The strange colors passed from before my vision. The Rattlesnake was coiling at my very feet, with glowing eyes and uplifted fangs; and my wife was clinging in terror upon me. The next instant the serpent threw himself upon us. My wife was the victim!---The fatal fangs pierced deeply into her hand; and her scream of agony, as she staggered backward from me, told me the dreadful truth. Then it was that a feeling of madness came upon me; and when I saw the foul serpent stealing away from his work of death, reckless of danger, I sprang [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] forward and crushed him under my feet, grinding him in pieces upon the ragged rock. The groans of my wife now recalled me to her side, and to the horrible reality of her situation. There was a dark, livid spot on her hand; and it deepened into blackness as I led her away. We were at a considerable distance from any dwelling; and after wandering for a short time, the pain of her wound became insupportable to my wife, and she swooned away in my arms. Weak and exhausted as I was, I had yet strength enough remaining to carry her to the nearest rivulet, and bathe her brow in the cool water. She partially recovered, and sat down upon the bank, while I supported her head upon my bosom. Hour after hour passed away, and none came near us,---and there---alone, in the great wilderness, I watched over her, and prayed with her--- and she died! The old man groaned audibly, as he uttered these words; and, as he clasped his long, bony hands over his eyes, I could see the tears falling thickly through his gaunt fingers. After a momentary struggle with his feelings, he lifted his head once more, and there was a fierce light in his eye as he spoke: "But I have had my revenge. From that fatal moment I have felt myself fitted and set apart, by the terrible ordeal of affliction, to rid the place of my abode [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] of its foulest curse. And I have well nigh succeeded. The fascinating demons are already few and powerless. Do not imagine," said he, earnestly regarding the somewhat equivocal expression of my countenance, "that I consider these creatures as serpents only---creeping serpents;---they are the servants of the fallen Angel---the immediate ministers of the infernal Gulf!" Years have passed since my interview with the Rattlesnake Hunter: the place of his abode has changed--- a beautiful village rises near the spot of our conference, and the grass of the church yard is green over the grave of the old Hunter. But his story is yet fixed upon my mind, and Time, like, enamel, only burns deeper the first strong impression. It comes up before me like a vividly remembered dream, whose features are too horrible for reality. [1] The Rattlesnake's power of fascination was generally admitted by the early settlers of the Colonies. That this serpent has actually the mysterious faculty of charming , or fascinating the prey upon which it subsists, is still believed, and upon good authority. That this power extended to human beings has also been asserted,---and that the effect produced by the charm upon the senses of its victim, was substantially the same as that described in the story of "The Rattlesnake Hunter." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] [Metacom, or Philip, the chief of the Wampanoags, was the most powerful and sagacious Sachem who ever made war upon the English. He had all the qualities of a high statesman---a noble monarch, and a courageous warrior. The rude majesty of untamed and unchastened nature was never more boldly developed than in the character of Metacom. He had the elements of a giant mind---the unformed chaos of a world of intellect. He perilled his all in one vast enterprise---in one mighty effort to shake off the White Vampyre which was draining the life-blood of his people; and had his enemies been any other than the stern settlers of New-England, they must assuredly have fallen. The War of King Philip forms a dark page in the history of New-England.---It is red with blood,---with the blood of the strong man and the meek and beseeching woman, and the fair-haired child, and the cradled infant.] Red as the banner which enshrouds The warrior-dead, when strife is done, A broken mass of crimson clouds Hung over the departed sun. The shadow of the western hill Crept swiftly down, and darkly still, As if a sullen wave of night Were rushing on the pale twilight--- The forest-openings grew more dim, As glimpses of the arching blue And waking stars came softly through The rifts of many a giant limb. Above the wet and tangled swamp White vapors gathered thick and damp, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] And through their cloudy-curtaining Flapped many a brown and dusky wing--- Pinions that fan the moonless dun, But fold them at the rising sun! Beneath the closing veil of night, And leafy bough and curling fog, With his few warriors ranged in sight--- Scarred relics of his latest fight--- Rested the fiery Wampanoag. He leaned upon his loaded gun, Warm with its recent work of death, And, save the struggling of his breath That, slow and hard, and long-suppressed, Shook the damp folds around his breast, An eye, that was unused to scan The sterner moods of that dark man, Had deemed his tall and silent form, With hidden passion fierce and warm, With that fixed eye, as still and dark As clouds which veil their lightning spark--- That of some forest-champion, Whom sudden death had passed up on--- A giant frozen into stone! Son of the throned Sachem!---Thou, The sternest of the forest kings,--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] Shall the scorned pale-one trample now, Unambushed on thy mountain's brow, Yea, drive his vile and hated plough Among thy nation's holy things, Crushing the warrior-skeleton In scorn beneath his armed heel, And not a hand be left to deal A kindred vengeance fiercely back, And cross in blood the Spoiler's track! He started,---for a sudden shot Came booming through the forest-trees--- The thunder of the fierce Yengeese: It passed away, and injured not; But, to the Sachem's brow it brought The token of his lion thought. He stood erect---his dark eye burned, As if to meteor-brightness turned; And o'er his forehead passed the frown Of an archangel stricken down, Ruined and lost, yet chainless still--- Weakened of power but strong of will! It passed---a sudden tremor came Like ague o'er his giant frame,--- It was not terror---he had stood For hours, with death in grim attendance, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] When moccasins grew stiff with blood, And through the clearing's midnight flame. Dark, as a storm, the Pequod came, His red, right arm their strong dependence--- When thrilling through the forest gloom The onset-cry of "Metacom!" Rang on the red and smoky air!--- No---it was agony which passed Upon his soul---the strong man's last And fearful struggle with despair. He turned him to his trustiest one--- The old and war-tried Annawon--- "Brother!"---The favored warrior stood In hushed and listening attitude--- "This night the Vision-Spirit hath Unrolled the scroll of fate before me; And ere the sunrise cometh, Death Will wave his dusky pinion o'er me! Nay, start not---well I know thy faith--- Thy weapon now may keep its sheath; But, when the bodeful morning breaks, And the green forest widely wakes, Unto the roar of Yengeese thunder, Then trusted brother, be it thine To burst upon the foeman's line, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] And rend his serried strength asunder. Perchance thyself and yet a few Of faithful ones may struggle through, And, rallying on the wooded plain, Strike deep for vengeance once again, And offer up in Yengeese blood An offering to the Indian's God." Another shot---a sharp, quick yell--- And then the stifled groan of pain, Told that another red man fell,--- And blazed a sudden light again Across that kingly brow and eye, Like lightning on a clouded sky,--- And a low growl, like that which thrills The hunter of the Eastern hills, Burst through clenched teeth and rigid lip --- And, when the Monarch spoke again His deep voice shook beneath its rein, As wrath and grief held fellowship. "Brother! methought when as but now I pondered on my nation's wrong, With sadness on his shadowy brow My father's spirit passed along! He pointed to the far south-west, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] Where sunset's gold was growing dim, And seemed to beckon me to him, And to the forests of the blest!--- My father loved the Yengeese, when They were but children, shelterless, For his great spirit at distress Melted to woman's tenderness--- Nor was it given him to know That, children whom he cherished then, Would rise at length, like armed men, To work his people's overthrow. Yet thus it is;---the God, before Whose awful shrine the pale ones bow, Hath frowned upon, and given o'er The red man to the stranger now!--- A few more moons---and there will be No gathering to the council tree--- The scorched earth---the blackened log--- The naked bones of warriors slain, Be the sole relics which remain Of the once mighty Wampanoag! The forests of our hunting-land, With all their old and solemn green, Will bow before the Spoiler's axe--- The plough displace the hunter's tracks, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] And the tall Yengeese altar stand Where the Great Spirit's shrine hath been! Yet, brother, from this awful hour The dying curse of Metacom Shall linger with abiding power Upon the spoilers of my home. The fearful veil of things to come, By Kitchtan's hand is lifted from The shadows of the embryo years; And I can see more clearly through Than ever visioned Powwah did, For all the future comes unbid Yet welcome to my tranced view, As battle-yell to warrior-ears! From stream and lake and hunting-hill, Our tribes may vanish like a dream, And even my dark curse may seem Like idle winds when Heaven is still--- No bodeful harbinger of ill, Bu,t fiercer than the downright thunder, When yawns the mountain-rock asunder, And riven pine and knotted oak Are reeling to the fearful stroke, That curse shall work its master's will! The bed of you blue mountain stream [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf412&image=412-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] Shall pour a darker tide than rain--- The sea shall catch its blood-red stain, And broadly on its banks shall gleam The steel of those who should be brothers Yea---those whom one fond parent nursed Shall meet in strife, like fiends accursed--- And trample down the once loved form, While yet with breathing passion warm, As fiercely as they would another's!" The morning star sat dimly on The lighted eastern horizon--- The deadly glare of levelled gun Came streaking through the twilight haze And naked to its reddest blaze, A hundred warriors sprang in view--- One dark red arm was tossed on high--- One giant shout came hoarsely through The clangour and the charging cry, Just as across the scattering gloom, Red as the naked hand of Doom, The Yengeese volley hurtled by--- The arm---the voice of Metacom!--- One piercing shriek---one vengeful yell, Sent like an arrow to the sky, Told when the hunter-monarch fell!
