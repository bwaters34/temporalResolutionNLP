A TALE OF TRUTH. By Mrs. ROWSON , OF THE NEW THEATRE PHILADELPHIA; AUTHOR of VICTORIA, THE INQUISITOR, FILLE DE CHAMBRE, & c . IN TWO VOLUMES. She was her parents only joy: They had but one---one darling child. Romeo and Juliet . Her form was faultle[s]s, and her mind, Untainted yet by art, Was nobly, ju[s]t, humane, and kind, And virtue warm'd her heart. But ah! the cruel [s]poiler came--- PRINTED FOR MATHEW CAREY, NO. 118, MARKET-STREET. OCT. 9---1794.

The circum[s]tances on which I have founded this novel were related to me [s]ome little time [s]ince by an old lady who had per[s]onally known Charlotte, though [s]he concealed the real names of the characters, and like wife the place where the unfortunate [s]cenes were acted: yet as it was impo[s][s]ible to offer a relation to the public in [s]uch an imperfect [s]tate, I have thrown over the whole a [s]light veil of fiction, and [s]ub[s]tituted names and places according to my own fancy. The principal characters in this little tale are now con[s]igned to the [s]ilent tomb: it can therefore hurt the feelings of no one; and may, I flatter my[s]elf, be of [s]ervice to [s]ome who are [s]o unfortunate as to have neither friends to advi[s]e, or understanding to direct them, through the various and unexpected evils that attend a young and unprotected woman in her fir[s]t entrance into life. While the tear of compa[s][s]ion [s]till trembled in my eye for the fate of the unhappy Charlotte, I may have children of my own, [s]aid I, to whom this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-009.jpg) \- external link  - Page vi. ] recital may be of u[s]e, and if to your own children, [s]aid Benevolence, why not to the many daughters of Misfortune who, deprived of natural friends, or [s]poilt by a mi[s]taken education, are thrown on an unfeeling world without the lea[s]t power to defend them[s]elves from the [s]nares not only of the other [s]ex, but from the more dangerous arts of the profligate of their own. Sen[s]ible as I am that a novel writer, at a time when [s]uch a variety of works are u[s]hered into the world under that name, [s]tands but a poor chance for [s]ame in the annals of literature, but con[s]cious that I wrote with a mind anxious for the happine[s]s of that [s]ex who[s]e morals and conduct have [s]o powerful an influence on mankind in general; and convinced that I have not wrote a line that conveys a wrong idea to the head or a corrupt wi[s]h to the heart, I [s]hall re[s]t [s]atisfied in the purity of my own intentions, and if I merit not applau[s]e, I feel that I dread not cen[s]ure. If the following tale [s]hould [s]ave one haple[s]s fair one from the errors which ruined poor Charlotte, or re[s]cue from impending mi[s]ery the heart of one anxious parent, I [s]hall feel a much higher gratification in reflecting on this trifling performance, than could po[s][s]ibly re[s]ult from the applau[s]e which might attend the mo[s]t elegant fini[s]hed piece of literature who[s]e tendency might deprave the heart or mi[s]lead the under[s]tanding. A TALE OF TRUTH. By Mrs. ROWSON , OF THE NEW THEATRE PHILADELPHIA; AUTHOR of VICTORIA, THE INQUISITOR, FILLE DE CHAMBRE, & c . IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I. Chapter I. A BOARDING SCHOOL.

Belcour preferred the former; and they [s]auntered out to view the town, and to make remarks on the inhabitants, as they returned from church. Montraville was a Lieutenant in the army: Belcour was his brother officer: they had been to take leave of their friends previous to their departure for America, and were now returning to Port[s]mouth, where the troops waited orders for embarkation. They had [s]topped at Chiche[s]ter to dine; and knowing they had [s]ufficient time to reach the place of de[s]tination before dark, and yet allow them a walk, had re[s]olved, it being Sunday afternoon, to take a [s]urvey of the Chiche[s]ter ladies as they returned from their devotions. They had gratified their curio[s]ity, and were preparing to return to the inn without honouring any of the belles with particular notice, when [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] Madame Du Pont, at the head of her [s]chool, de[s]cended from the church. Such an a[s][s]emblage of youth and innocence naturally attracted the young [s]oldiers: they [s]topped; and, as the little cavalcade pa[s][s]ed, almo[s]t involuntarily pulled off thir hats. A tall, elegant girl looked at Montraville and blu[s]hed: he in[s]tantly recollected the features of Charlotte Temple, whom he had once [s]een and danced with at a ball at Port[s]mouth. At that time he thought on her only as a very lovely child, [s]he being then only thirteen; but the improvement two years had made in her per[s]on, and the blu[s]h of recollection which [s]uffu[s]ed her cheeks as [s]he pa[s][s]ed, awakened in his bo[s]om new and pleasing ideas. Vanity led him to think that plea[s]ure at again beholding him might have occa[s]ioned the emotion he had witne[s][s]ed, and the [s]ame vanity led him to wi[s]h to [s]ee her again. "She is the [s]weete[s]t girl in the world," [s]aid he, as he entered the inn. Belcour [s]tared. "Did you not notice her?" continued Montraville: [s]he had on a blue bonnet, and with a pair of lovely eyes of the [s]ame colour, has contrived to make me feel devili[s]h odd about the heart." "Pho," [s]aid Belcour, "a mu[s]ket ball from our friends, the Americans, may in le[s]s than two months make you feel wor[s]e." "I never think of the future," replied Montraville; but am determined to make the mo[s]t of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] the pre[s]ent, and would willingly compound with any kind Familiar who would inform me who the girl is, and how I might be likely to obtain an interview." But no kind Familiar at that time appearing, and the chai[s]e which they had ordered driving up to the door, Montraville and his companion were obliged to take leave of Chiche[s]ter and its fair inhabitant, and proceed on their journey. But Charlotte had made too great an impre[s][s]ion on his mind to be ea[s]ily eradicated: having therefore [s]pent three whole days in thinking on her and in endeavouring to form [s]ome plan for [s]eeing her, he determined to [s]et off for Chiche[s]ter, and tru[s]t to chance either to favour or fru[s]trate his de[s]igns. Arriving at the verge of the town, he di[s]mounted, and [s]ending the [s]ervant forward with the hor[s]es, proceeded toward the place, where, in the mid[s]t of an exten[s]ive plea[s]ure ground, [s]tood the man[s]ion which contained the lovely Charlotte Temple. Montraville leaned on a broken gate, and looked earne[s]tly at the hou[s]e. The wall which [s]urrounded it was high, and perhaps the Argus's who guarded the He[s]perian fruit within, were more watchful than tho[s]e famed of old. "'Tis a romantic attempt," [s]aid he; "and [s]hould I even [s]ucceed in [s]eeing and conver[s]ing with her, it can be productive of no good: I mu[s]t of nece[s][s]ity leave England in a few days, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] probably may never return; why then [s]hould I endeavour to engage the affections of this lovely girl, only to leave her a prey to a thou[s]and inquietudes, of which at pre[s]ent [s]he has no idea? I will return to Port[s]mouth and think no more about her." The evening now was clo[s]ed; a [s]erene [s]tilne[s]s reigned; and the cha[s]te Queen of Night with her [s]ilver cre[s]cent faintly illuminated the hemi[s]phere. The mind of Montraville was hu[s]hed into composure by the [s]erenity of the [s]urrounding objects. "I will think on her no more," [s]aid he, and turned with an intention to leave the place; but as he turned, he [s]aw the gate which led to the plea[s]ure grounds open, and two women come out, who walked arm-in-arm acro[s]s the field. "I will at lea[s]t [s]ee who the[s]e are," [s]aid he. He overtook them, and giving them the compliments of the evening, begged leave to [s]ee them into the more frequented parts of the town: but how was he delighted, when, waiting for an an[s]wer, he di[s]covered, under the concealment of a large bonnet, the face of Charlotte Temple. He [s]oon found means to ingratiathe him[s]elf with her companion, who was a French teacher at the [s]chool, and, at parting, [s]lipped a letter he had purpo[s]ely written, into Charlotte's hand, and five guineas into that of Mademoi[s]elle, who promi[s]ed [s]he would endeavour to bring her young charge into the field again the next evening. DOMESTIC CONCERNS. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] Mr. Temple was the younge[s]t [s]on of a nobleman who[s]e fortune was by no means adequate to the antiquity, grandeur, and I may add, pride of the family. He [s]aw his elder brother made completely wretched by marrying a di[s]agreeable woman, who[s]e fortune helped to prop the [s]inking dignity of the hou[s]e; and he beheld his [s]i[s]ters legally pro[s]tituted to old, decrepid men, who[s]e titles gave them con[s]equence in the eyes of the world, and who[s]e affluence rendered them [s]plendidly mi[s]erable. "I will not [s]acrifice internal happine[s]s for outward [s]hew," [s]aid he: "I will [s]eek Content; and, if I find her in a cottage, will embrace her with as much cordiality as I [s]hould if [s]eated on a throne." Mr. Temple po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a [s]mall e[s]tate of about five hundred pounds a year; and with that he re[s]olved to pre[s]erve independence, to marry where the feelings of his heart [s]hould direct him, and to confine his expen[s]es within the limits of his income. He had a heart open to every generous feeling of humanity, and a hand ready to di[s]pen[s]e to tho[s]e who wanted part of the ble[s][s]ings he enjoyed him[s]elf. As he was univer[s]ally known to be the friend [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] of the unfortunate, his advice and bounty was frequently [s]olicited; nor was it [s]eldom that he [s]ought out indigent merit, and rai[s]ed it from ob[s]curity, confining his own expen[s]es within a very narrow compa[s]s. "You are a benevolent fellow," [s]aid a young officer to him one day; "and I have a great mind to give you a fine [s]ubject to exerci[s]e the goodne[s]s of your heart upon." "You cannot oblige me more," [s]aid Temple, "than to point out any way by which I can be [s]erviceable to my fellow creatures." "Come along then," [s]aid the young man, "we will go and vi[s]it a man who is not in [s]o good a lodging as he de[s]erves; and, were it not that he has an angel with him, who comforts and [s]upports him, he mu[s]t long [s]ince have [s]unk under his misfortunes." The young man's heart was too full to proceed; and Temple, unwilling to irritate his feeling by making further enquiries, followed him in [s]ilence, till they arrived at the Fleet pri[s]on. The officer enquired for Captain Eldridge: a per[s]on led them up [s]everal pair of dirty [s]tairs, and pointing to a door which led to a mi[s]erable, [s]mall apartment, [s]aid that was the Captain's room, and retired. The officer, who[s]e name was Blakeney, tapped at the door, and was bid to enter by a voice [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] melodiou[s]ly [s]oft. He opened the door, and discovered to Temple a [s]cene which rivetted him to the [s]pot with a[s]toni[s]hment. The apartment, though [s]mall, and bearing [s]trong marks of poverty, was neat in the extreme. In an arm-chair, his head reclined upon his hand, his eyes fixed on a book which lay open before him, [s]at an aged man in a Lieutenant's uniform, which, though threadbare, would [s]ooner call a blu[s]h of [s]hame into the face of tho[s]e who could neglect real merit, than cau[s]e the hectic of confu[s]ion to glow on the cheeks of him who wore it. Be[s]ide him [s]at a lovely creature bu[s]ied in painting a fan mount. She was fair as the lily, but [s]orrow had nipped the ro[s]e in her cheek before it was half blown. Her eyes were blue; and her hair, which was light brown, was [s]lightly confined under a plain mu[s]lin cap, tied round with a black ribbon; a white linnen gown and plain lawn handkerchief compo[s]ed the remainder of her dre[s]s; and in this [s]imple attire, [s]he was more irre[s]i[s]tibly charming to [s]uch a heart as Temple's, than [s]he would have been, if adorned with all the [s]plendor of a courtly belle. When they entered, the old man aro[s]e from his [s]eat, and [s]haking Blakeney by the hand with great cordiality, offered Temple his chair; and there being but three in the room, [s]eated mim[s]elf on the [s]ide of his little bed, with evident compo[s]ure. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] "This is a [s]trange place," [s]aid he to Temple, "to receive vi[s]itors of di[s]tinction in; but we mu[s]t fit our feelings to our [s]tation. While I am not a[s]hamed to own the cau[s]e which brought me here, why [s]hould I blu[s]h at my [s]ituation? Our misfortunes are not our faults; and where it not for that poor girl---" Here the philo[s]opher was lo[s]t in the father. He ro[s]e ha[s]tily from his [s]eat, and walking toward the window, wiped of a tear which he was afraid would tarni[s]h the cheek of a [s]ailor. Temple ca[s]t his eye on Mi[s]s Eldridge; a pellucid drop had [s]tolen from her eyes, and fallen upon a ro[s]e [s]he was painting. It blotted and di[s]coloured the flower. "'Tis emblematic," [s]aid he mentally: "the ro[s]e of youth and health [s]oon [s]ades when wa "tered by the tear of affliction." "My friend Blakeney," [s]aid he, addre[s][s]ing the old man, "told me I could be of [s]ervice to you: be [s]o kind then, dear Sir, as to point out [s]ome way in which I can relieve the anxiety of your heart and increa[s]e the plea[s]ures of my own." "My good young man," [s]aid Eldridge, "you know not what you offer. While deprived of my liberty I cannot be free from anxiety on my own account; but that is a trifling concern; my anxious thoughts extend to one more dear a thou[s]and times than life: I am a poor weak old man, and mu[s]t expect in a few years to [s]ink into [s]ilence and oblivion; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] but when I am gone, who will protect that fair bud of innocence from the bla[s]ts of adver[s]ity, or from the cruel hand of in[s]ult and di[s]honour." "Oh, my father!" cried Mi[s]s Eldridge, tenderly taking his hand, "be not anxious on that account; for daily are my prayers offered to heaven that our lives may terminate at the [s]ame in[s]tant, and one grave receive us both; for why [s]hould I live when deprived of my only friend." Temple was moved even to tears. You will both live many years, [s]aid he, and I hope [s]ee much happiness. Cheerly, my friend, cheerly; the[s]e pa[s][s]ing clouds of adver[s]ity will [s]erve only to make the sunshine of pro[s]perity more plea[s]ing. But we are losing time: you might ere this have told me who were your creditors, what were their demands, and other particulars nece[s][s]ary to your liberation. "My [s]tory is [s]hort," [s]aid Mr. Eldridge, "but there are [s]ome particulars which will wring my heart barely to remember; yet to one who[s]e offers of friend[s]hip appear [s]o open and di[s]intere[s]ted, I will relate every circum[s]tance that led to my pre[s]ent, painful [s]ituation. But my child, continued he, addressing his daughter, "let me prevail on you to take this opportunity, while my friends are with me, to enjoy the benefit of air and exerci[s]e. Go, my love; leave me now; to-morrow at your u[s]ual hour I will expect you." Mi[s]s Eldridge impre[s][s]ed on his cheek the ki[s]s of filial affection, and obeyed. UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNES. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] " My life," [s]aid Mr. Eldridge, "till within the[s]e few years was marked by no particular circum[s]tance de[s]erving notice. I early embraced the life of a [s]ailor, and have [s]erved my King with unremitted ardour for many years. At the age of twenty-five I married an amiable woman; one [s]on and the girl who ju[s]t now left us, were the fruits of our union. My boy had genious and [s]pirit. I [s]traitened my little income to give him a liberal education, but the rapid progre[s]s he made in his [s]tudies amply compen[s]ated for the inconvenience. At the academy where he received his education he commenced an acquaintance with a Mr. Lewis, a young man of affluent fortune: as they grew up their intimacy ripened into friend[s]hip, and they became almo[s]t in[s]eparable companions. "George cho[s]e the profe[s][s]ion of a [s]oldier. I had neither friends or money to procure him a commission, and had wi[s]hed him to embrace a nautical life: but this was repugnant to his wi[s]hes, and I cea[s]ed to urge him on the [s]ubject. "The friend[s]hip [s]ub[s]i[s]ting between Lewis and my [s]on was of [s]uch a nature as gave him free acce[s]s to our family; and [s]o [s]pecious was his manner that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] we he[s]itated not to [s]tate to him all our little difficulties in regard to George's future views. He li[s]tened to us with attention, and offered to advance any [s]um nece[s][s]ary for his fir[s]t [s]etting out. "I embraced the offer, and gave him my note for the payment of it, but he would not [s]uffer me to mention any [s]tipulated time, as he [s]aid I might do it whenever mo[s]t convenient to my[s]elf. About this time my dear Lucy returned from [s]chool, and I [s]oon began to imagine Lewis looked at her with eyes of affection. I gave my child a caution to beware of him,and to look on her mother as her friend. She was unaffectedly artle[s]s; and when, as I suspected, Lewis made profe[s][s]ions of love, [s]he con[s]ided in her parents, and a[s][s]ured us her heart was perfectly unbia[s][s]ed in his favour, and [s]he would chearfully submit to our direction. "I took an early opportunity of que[s]tioning him concerning his intentions towards my child: he gave an equivocal an[s]wer, and I forbade him the hou[s]e. "The next day lie [s]ent and demanded payment of his money. It was not in my power to comply with the demand. I reque[s]ted three days to endeavour to rai[s]e it, determining in that time to mortgage my half pay, and live on a [s]mall annuity which my wife po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, rather than be under an obligation to [s]o worthle[s]s a man: but this [s]hort time was not allowed me; for that evening, as I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] was [s]itting down to [s]upper, un[s]u[s]picious of danger, an officer entered, and tore me from the embraces of my family. "My wife had been for [s]ome time in a declining [s]tate of health: ruin at once [s]o unexpected and inevitable was a [s]troke [s]he was not prepared to bear, and I [s]aw her [s]aint into the arms of our [s]ervant, as I left my own habitation for the comfortless walls of a pri[s]on. My poor Lucy, distracted with her fears for us both, [s]unk on the floor and endeavoured to detain me by her feeble efforts; but in vain; they forced open her arms; [s]he [s]hrieked, and fell pro[s]trate. But pardon me. The horrors of that night unman me. I cannot proceed." He ro[s]e from his [s]eat, and walked [s]everal times acro[s]s the room: at length, attaining more composure, he cried---"What a mere infant I am! Why, Sir, I never felt thus in the day of battle." "No," [s]aid Temple; "but the truly brave [s]oul is tremblingly alive to the feelings of humanity." "True," replied the old man, ([s]omething like [s]atisfaction darting acro[s]s his features) "and painful as the[s]e feelings are, I would not exchange them for that torpor which the [s]toic mi[s]takes for philo[s]ophy. How many exqui[s]it delights [s]hould I have pa[s][s]ed by unnoticed, but for the[s]e keen sensations, this quick [s]en[s]e of happine[s]s or mi[s]ery? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] Then let us, my friend, take the cup of life as it is pre[s]ented to us, tempered by the hand of a wife Providence; be thankful for the good, be patient under the evil, and pre[s]ume not to enquire why the latter predominates." "This is true philo[s]ophy," [s]aid Temple. "'Tis the only way to reconcile our[s]elves to the cro[s]s events of life," replied he. "But I forgot my[s]elf. I will not longer intrude on your patience, but proceed in my melancholy tale. "The very evening that I was taken to pri[s]on, my [s]on arrived from Irelend, where he had been [s]ome time with his regiment. From the di[s]tracted expre[s][s]ions of his mother and [s]i[s]ter, he learnt by whom I had been arre[s]ted; and, late as it was, flew on the wings of wounded affection, to the hou[s]e of his fal[s]e friend, and earne[s]tly enquired the cau[s]e of this cruel conduct. With all the calmne[s]s of a cool deliberate villain, he avowed his pa[s][s]ion for Lucy; declared her [s]ituation in life would not permit him to marry her; but offered to relea[s]e me immediately, and make any [s]ettlement on her, if George would per[s]uade her to live, as he impiou[s]ly termed it, a life of honour. "Fired at the in[s]ult offered to a man and a foldier, my boy [s]truck the villain, and a challenge ensued. He then went to a coffee-hou[s]e in the neighbourhood and wrote a long affectionate letter to me, blaming him[s]elf [s]everely for having introduced [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] Lewis into the family, or permitted him to confer an obligation, which had brought inevitable ruin on us all. He begged me, whatever might be the event of the en[s]uing morning, not to [s]uffer regret or unavailing [s]orrow for his fate, to encrea[s]e the angui[s]h of my heart, which he greatly feared was already in[s]upportable. "This letter was delivered to me early in the morning. It would be in vain to attempt de[s]cribing my feelings on the peru[s]al of it; [s]uffice it to [s]ay, that a merciful Providence interpo[s]ed, and I was for three weeks in[s]en[s]ible to mi[s]eries almo[s]t beyond the [s]trength of human nature to [s]upport. "A fever and [s]trong delirium [s]eized me, and my life was de[s]paired of. At length nature, overpowered with fatigue, gave way to the [s]alutary power of re[s]t, and a quiet [s]lumber of [s]ome hours re[s]tored me to rea[s]on, though the extreme weakne[s]s of my frame prevented my feeling my di[s]tre[s]s [s]o acutely as I otherways [s]hould. "The fir[s]t object that [s]truck me on awaking, was Lucy [s]itting by my bed[s]ide; her pale countenance and [s]able dre[s]s prevented my enquiries for poor George: for the letter I had received from him, was the fir[s]t thing that occurred to my memory. By degrees the re[s]t returned: I recollected being arre[s]ted, but could no ways account for being in this apartment, whither they had conveyed me during my illne[s]s. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] "I was [s]o weak as to be almo[s]t unable to [s]peak. pre[s][s]ed Lucy's hand, and looked earne[s]tly round the apartment in [s]earch of another dear object. "Where is your mother?" [s]aid I, faintly. "The poor girl could not an[s]wer: [s]he [s]hook her head in expre[s][s]ive [s]ilence; and throwing her[s]elf on the bed, folded her arms about me, and bur[s]t into tears. "What! both gone [s]aid I. "Both, [s]he replied, endeavouring to re[s]train her emotions: "but they are happy, no doubt." Here Mr. Eldridge pau[s]ed: the recollection of the [s]cene was too painful to permit him to proceed. CHANGE OF FORTUNE. " It was [s]ome days," continued Mr. Eldridge, recovering him[s]elf, "before I could venture to enquire the particulars of what had happened during my illne[s]s: at length I a[s][s]umed courage to a[s]k my dear girl how long her mother and brother had been dead: [s]he told me, that the morning after my arre[s]t, George came home early to enquire after his mother's health, [s]taid with them but a few minutes, [s]eemed greatly agitated at parting, but gave them [s]trict charge to keep up their [s]pirits, and hope every thing would turn out for the be[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] In about two hours after, as they were [s]itting at breakfa[s]t, and endeavouring to [s]trike out [s]ome plan to attain my liberty, they heard a loud rap at the door, which Lucy running to open, [s]he met the bleeding body of her brother, borne in by two men who had lifted him from a litter, on which they had brought him from the place where he fought. Her poor mother, weakened by illne[s]s and the [s]truggles of the preceding night, was not able to [s]upport this [s]hock: ga[s]ping for her breath, her looks wild and haggard, [s]he reached the apartment where they had carried her dying [s]on. She knelt by the bed [s]ide; and taking his cold hand, `my poor boy,' [s]aid [s]he, `I will not be parted from thee; hu[s]band! [s]on! both at once lo[s]t. Father of mercies, [s]pare me!' She fell into a [s]trong convul[s]ion, and expired in about two hours. In the mean time, a [s]urgeon had dre[s][s]ed George's wounds; but they were in [s]uch a [s]ituation as to bar the [s]malle[s]t hopes of recovery. He never was [s]en[s]ible from the time he was brought home, and died that evening in the arms of his [s]i[s]ster. "Late as it was when this event took place, my affectionate Lucy in[s]i[s]ted on coming to me. `What mu[s]t he feel,' [s]aid [s]he, `at our apparent neglect, and how [s]hall I inform him of the afflictions with which it has plea[s]ed heaven to vi[s]it us?" "She left the care of the dear departed ones to [s]ome neighbours who had kindly come in to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] comfort and a[s][s]i[s]t her; and on entering the hou[s]e where I was con[s]ined, found me in the [s]ituation I have mentioned. "How [s]he [s]upported her[s]elf in the[s]e trying moments, I know not: heaven, no doubt, was with her; and her anxiety to pre[s]erve the life of one parent in [s]ome mea[s]ure abated her affliction for the lo[s]s of the other. "My circum[s]tances were greatly embarra[s][s]ed, my acquaintance few, and tho[s]e few utterly unable to a[s][s]i[s]t me. When my wife and [s]on were committed to the kindred earth, my creditors [s]eized my hou[s]e and furniture, which not being [s]ufficient to di[s]charge all their demands, detainers were lodged again[s]t me. No friend [s]tepped forward to my relief; from the grave of her mother, my beloved Lucy followed an almo[s]t dying father to this melancholy place. "Here we have been nearly a year and a half. My half-pay I have given up to [s]atisfy my creditors, and my child [s]upports me by her indu[s]try: sometimes by fine needlework, [s]ometimes by painting. She leaves me every night, and goes to a lodging near the bridge: but returns in the morning, to chear me with her [s]miles, and ble[s]s me by her duteous affection. A lady once offered her an a[s]ylum in her family; but [s]he would not leave me. `We are all the world to each other,' [s]aid [s]he. `I thank God, I have health and [s]pirits to improve [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] the talents with which nature has endowed me; and I tru[s]t if I employ them in the [s]upport of a beloved parent, I [s]hall not be thought an unprofitable [s]ervant. While he lives, I pray for [s]trength to pur[s]ue my employment; and when it plea[s]es heaven to take one of us, may it give the [s]urvivor re[s]ignation to bear the [s]eparation as we ought: till then I will never leave him.' "But where is this inhuman per[s]ecutor?" [s]aid 'Temple. "He has been abroad ever [s]ince," replied the old man; but he has left orders with his lawyer never to give up the note till the utmo[s]t farthing is paid." "And how much is the amount of your debts in all?" [s]aid Temple. "Five hundred pounds," he replied. Temple [s]tarted: it was more than he expected. "But [s]omething mu[s]t be done," [s]aid he: "that [s]weet maid mu[s]t not wear out her life in a pri[s]on. I will [s]ee you again to-morrow, my friend," [s]aid he, [s]haking Eldridge's hand: "keep up your [s]pirits: light and [s]hade are not more happily blended than are the plea[s]ures and pains of life; and the horrors of the one [s]erve only to increa[s]e the splendor of the other." "You never lo[s]t a wife and [s]on," [s]aid Eldridge. "No." replied he, "but I can feel for tho[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] that have." Eldridge pre[s][s]ed his hand as they went toward the door, and they parted in [s]ilence. When they got without the walls of the pri[s]on, Temple thanked his friend Blakeney for introducing him to [s]o worthy a character; and telling him he had a particular engagement in the city, wi[s]hed him a good evening. "And what is to be done for this di[s]tre[s][s]ed man," [s]aid Temple, as he walked up Ludgate Hill. "Would to heaven I had a fortune that would enable me in[s]tantly to di[s]charge his debt; what exqui[s]ite tran[s]port, to [s]ee the expre[s][s]ive eyes of Lucy beaming at once with plea[s]ure for her father's deliverance, and gratitude for her deliverer: but is not my fortune affluence," continued he, "nay [s]uperfluous wealth, when compared to the extreme indigence of Eldridge; and what have I done to deserve ea[s]e and plenty, while a brave worthy officer [s]tarves in a pri[s]on? Three hundred a year is [s]urely [s]ufficient for all my wants and wi[s]hes: at any rate Eldridge mu[s]t be relieved." When the heart has will, the hands can [s]oon find means to execute a good action. Temple was a young man, his feelings warm and impetuous; unacquainted with the world, his heart had not been rendered callous by being convinced of its fraud and hypocri[s]y. He pitied their sufferings, overlooked their faults, thought every bosom as generous as his own, and would chearfully [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] have divided his la[s]t guinea with an unfortunate fellow creature. No wonder then that [s]uch a man (without waiting a moment for the interference of Madam Prudence) [s]hould re[s]olve to rai[s]e money [s]ufficient for the relief of Eldridge, by mortgaging part of his fortune. We will not enquire too minutely into the cau[s]e which might actuate him in this in[s]tance: [s]uffice it to [s]ay, he immediately put the plan in execution; and in three days from the time he fir[s]t [s]aw the unfortunate Lieutenant, he had the [s]uperlative felicity of [s]eeing him at liberty, and receiving an ample reward in the tearful eye and half articulated thanks of the grateful Lucy. "And pray, young man," [s]aid his father to him one morning, "what are your de[s]igns in vi[s]iting thus con[s]tantly that old man and his daughter?" Temple was at a lo[s]s for a reply: he had never a[s]ked him[s]elf the que[s]tion: he he[s]itated and his father continued--- "It was not till within the[s]e few days that I heard in what manner your acquaintance fir[s]t commenced, and cannot [s]uppo[s]e any thing but attachment to the daughter could carry you [s]uch imprudent lengths for the father: it certainly mu[s]t be her art that drew you in to mortgage part of your fortune." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] "Art, Sir!" cried Temple eagerly. "Lucy Eldridge is as free from art as [s]he is from every other error: [s]he is ---" "Every thing that is amiable and lovely," [s]aid his father, interrupting him ironically: "no doubt in your opinion [s]he is a pattern of excellence for all her [s]ex to follow; but come, Sir, pray tell me what are your de[s]igns toward this paragon. I hope you do not intend to complete your folly by marrying her." "Were my fortune [s]uch as would [s]upport her according to her merit, I don't know a woman more formed to en[s]ure happine[s]s in the married [s]tate." "Then prithee, my dear lad," [s]aid his father, [s]ince your rank and fortune are [s]o much beneath what your Prince[s]s might expect, be [s]o kind as to turn your eyes to Mi[s]s Weatherby; who having only an e[s]tate of three thou[s]and a year, is more upon a level with you, and who[s]e father ye[s]terday [s]olicited the mighty honour of your alliance. I [s]hall leave you to con[s]ider on this offer; and pray remember, that your union with Mi[s]s Weatherby will put it in your power to be more liberally the friend of Lucy El dridge." The old gentleman walked in a [s]tately manner out of the room; and Temple [s]tood almo[s]t petrified with a[s]toni[s]hment, contempt, and rage. SUCH THINGS ARE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] Miss Weatherby was the only child of a wealthy man, almo[s]t idolized by her parents, flattered by her dependants,and never contradicted even by tho[s]e who called them[s]elves her friends: I cannot give a better de[s]cription than by the following lines. The lovely maid who[s]e form and face Nature has deck'd with ev'ry grace, But in who[s]e brea[s]t no virtues glow, Who[s]e heart ne'er felt another's woe, Who[s]e hand ne'er [s]mooth'd the bed of pain, Or eas'd the captive's galling chain: But like the tulip caught the eye, Born ju[s]t to be admir'd and die; When gone, no one regrets it's lo[s]s, Or [s]carce remembers that it was. Such was Mi[s]s Weatherby: her form lovely as nature could make it, but her mind uncultivated, her heart unfeeling, her pa[s][s]ions impetuous, and her brain almo[s]t turned with flattery, di[s][s]ipation, and plea[s]ure; and [s]uch was the girl, whom a partial grandfather left independent mi[s]tre[s]s of the fortune before mentioned. She had [s]een Temple frequently; and fancying [s]he could never be happy without him, nor once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] imagining he could refu[s]e a girl of her beauty and fortune, [s]he prevailed on her fond father to offer the alliance to the old Earl of D---, Mr. Temple's father. The Earl had received the offer courteou[s]ly: he thought it a great match for Henry; and was too fa[s]hionable a man to [s]uppo[s]e a wife could be any impediment to the friend[s]hip he profe[s][s]ed for Eldridge and his daughter. Unfortunately for Temple, he thought quite otherwi[s]e: the conver[s]ation he had ju[s]t had with his father, di[s]covered to him the [s]ituation of his heart; and he found that the mo[s]t affluent fortune would bring no increa[s]e of happine[s]s unle[s]s Lucy Eldridge [s]hared it with him; and the knowledge of the purity of her [s]entiments, and the integrity of his own heart, made him [s]hudder at the idea his father had [s]tarted, of marrying a woman for no other rea[s]on than becau[s]e the affluence of her fortune would enable him to injure her by maintaining in [s]plendour the woman to whom his heart was devoted: he therefore re[s]olved to refu[s]e Mi[s]s Weatherby, and be the event what it might, offer his heart and hand to Lucy Eldridge. Full of this determination, he [s]ought his father, declared his re[s]olution, and was commanded never more to appear in his pre[s]ence. Temple bowed: his heart was too full to permit him to [s]peak; he left the hou[s]e precipitately, and ha[s]tened to relate the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] cau[s]e of his [s]orrows to his good old friend and his amiable daughter. In the mean time, the Earl, vexed to the [s]oul that [s]uch a fortune [s]hould be lo[s]t, determined to offer him[s]elf a candidate for Mi[s]s Weatherby's fafour. What wonderful changes are wrought by that reiguing power, ambition! the love-[s]ick girl, when fir[s]t [s]he heard of Temple's refu[s]al, wept, raved, tore her hair, and vowed to found a prote[s]tant nunnery with her fortune; and by commencing abbe[s]s, [s]hut her[s]elf up from the [s]ight of cruel ungrateful man for ever. Her father was a man of the world: he [s]uffered this fir[s]t tran[s]port to [s]ub[s]ide, and then very deliberately un[s]olded to her the offers of the old Earl, expatiated on the many benefits ari[s]ing from an elevated title, painted in glowing colours the surprise and vexation of Temple when he [s]hould [s]ee her figuring as a Counte[s]s and his mother-in-law, and begged her to con[s]ider well before [s]he made any ra[s]h vows. The di[s]tre[s][s]ed fair one dried her tears, li[s]tened patiently, and at length declared [s]he believed the [s]ure[s]t method to revenge the [s]light put on her by the [s]on would be to accept the father: [s]o [s]aid [s]o done, and in a few days [s]he became the Counte[s]s D---. Temple heard the news with emotion: he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] lo[s]t his father's favour by avowing his pa[s][s]ion for Lucy, and he [s]aw now there was no hope of regaining it: "but he [s]hall not make me miserable," [s]aid he, "Lucy and I have no ambitious notions: we can live on three hundred a year for [s]ome little time, till the mortgage is paid off, and then we [s]hall have [s]ufficient not only for the comforts but many of the little elegancies of life. We will purcha[s]e a little cottage, my Lucy," [s]aid he, "and thither with your reverend father we will retire; we will forget there are [s]uch things as [s]plendor profu[s]ion, and di[s][s]ipation: we will have [s]ome cows, and you [s]hall be queen of the dairy; in a morning, while I look after my garden, you [s]hall take a ba[s]ket on your arm, and [s]ally forth to feed your poultry; and as they flutter round you in token of humble gratitude, your father [s]hall [s]moke his pipe in a woodbine alcove, and viewing the [s]erenity of your countenance, feel [s]uch real pleasure dilate his own heart, as [s]hall make him forget he had ever been unhappy." Lucy [s]miled; and Temple [s]aw it was a [s]mile of approbation. He [s]ought and [s]ound a cottage [s]uited to his ta[s]te; thither, attended my Love and Hymen, the happy trio retired; where, during many years of uninterrupted felicity, they ca[s]t not a wi[s]h beyond the little boundaries of their own tenement. Plenty, and her handmaid, Prudence, pre[s]ided at their board, Ho[s]pitality [s]tood at their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] gate, Peace [s]miled on each face, Content reigned in each heart, and Love and Health [s]trewed ro[s]es on their pillows. Such were the parents of Charlotte Temple, who was the only pledge of their mutual love, and who, at the earne[s]t entreaty of a particular friend, was permitted to fini[s]h the education her mother had begun, at Madame Du Pont's [s]chool, where we fir[s]t introduced her to the acquaintance of the reader. AN INTRIGUING TEACHER. Madame Du Pont was a woman every way calculated to take the care of young ladies, had that care entirely devolved on her[s]elf: but it was impo[s][s]ible to attend the education of a numerous [s]chool without proper a[s][s]i[s]tants: and tho[s]e a[s][s]i[s]tants were not always the kind of people who[s]e conver[s]ation and morals were exactly [s]uch as parents of delicacy and refinement would wi[s]h a daughter to copy. Among the teachers at Madame Du Pont's [s]chool, was Mademoi[s]elle La Rue, who added to a plea[s]ing per[s]on and in[s]inuating addre[s]s, a liberal education and the manners of a gentlewoman. She was recommended to the [s]chool by a lady who[s]e humanity over[s]tepped the bounds [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] of di[s]cretion: for though [s]he knew Mi[s]s La Rue had eloped from a convent with a young officer, and on coming to England had lived with [s]everal different men in open defiance of all moral and religious duties; yet, finding her reduced to the mo[s]t abject want, and believing the penitence which [s]he profe[s][s]ed to be [s]incere, [s]he took her into her own family, and from thence recommended her to Madame Du Pont, as thinking the [s]ituation more [s]uitable for a woman of her abilities. But Mademoi[s]elle po[s][s]e[s][s]ed too much of the [s]pirit of intrigue to remain long without adventures. At church, where [s]he con[s]tantly appeared, her per[s]on attracted the attention of a young man who was upon a vi[s]it at a gentleman's [s]eat in the neighbourhood: [s]he had met him [s]everal times clande[s]tinely; and being invited to come out that evening, and eat [s]ome fruit and pa[s]try in a [s]ummer-hou[s]e belonging to the gentleman he was vi[s]iting, and reque[s]ted to bring [s]ome of the ladies with her, Charlotte being her favourite, was fixed on to accompany her. The mind of youth eagerly catches at promi[s]ed plea[s]ure: pure and innocent by nature, it thinks not of the dangers lurking beneath tho[s]e plea[s]ures, till too late to avoid them: when Mademoi[s]elle a[s]ked Charlotte to go with her, [s]he mentioned the gentleman as a relation, and [s]poke in [s]uch high terms of the elegance of his gardens, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] sprightliness of his conver[s]ation, and the liberality with which he ever entertained his gue[s]ts, that Charlotte thought only of the plea[s]ure [s]he [s]hould enjoy in the vi[s]it,---not on the imprudence of going without her governe[s]s's knowledge, or of the danger to which [s]he expo[s]ed her[s]elf in vi[s]iting the hou[s]e of a gay young man of fa[s]hion. Madame Du Pont was gone out for the evening, and the re[s]t of the ladies retired to re[s]t, when Charlotte and the teacher [s]tole out at the back gate, and in cro[s][s]ing the field, were acco[s]ted by Montraville, as mentioned in the fir[s]t chapter. Charlotte was di[s]appointed in the plea[s]ure [s]he had promi[s]ed her[s]elf from this vi[s]it. The levity of the gentlemen and the freedom of their conversation di[s]gu[s]ted her. She was a[s]toni[s]hed at the liberties Mademoi[s]elle permitted them to take; grew thoughtful and unea[s]y, and heartily wi[s]hed her[s]elf at home again in her own chamber. Perhaps one cau[s]e of that wi[s]h might be, an earnest de[s]ire to [s]ee the contents of the letter which had been put into her hand by Montraville. Any reader who has the lea[s]t knowledge of the world, will ea[s]ily imagine the letter was made up of encomiums on her beauty, and vows of everlasting love and con[s]tancy; nor will he be [s]urpri[s]ed that a heart open to every gentle, generous sentiment, [s]hould feel it[s]elf warmed by gratitude for a man who profe[s][s]ed to feel [s]o much for her; nor is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] it improbable but her mind might revert to the agreeable per[s]on and martial appearance of Montraville. In affairs of love, a young heart is never in more danger than when attempted by a hand[s]ome young [s]oldier. A man of an indifferent appearance, will, when arrayed in a military habit, [s]hew to advantage; but when beauty of per[s]on, elegance of manner, and an ea[s]y method of paying compliments, are united to the [s]carlet coat, [s]mart cockade, and military [s]a[s]h, ah! well-a-day for the poor girl who gazes on him: [s]he is in imminent danger; but if [s]he li[s]tens to him with plea[s]ure, 'tis all over with her, and from that moment [s]he has neither eyes nor ears for any other object. Now, my dear [s]ober matron, (if a [s]ober matron [s]hould de[s]ign to turn over the[s]e pages, before [s]he tru[s]ts them to the eye of a darling daughter,) let me intreat you not to put on a grave face, and throw down the book in a pa[s][s]ion and declare 'tis enough to turn the heads of half the girls in England; I do [s]olemnly prote[s]t, my dear madam, I mean no more by what I have here advanced, than to ridicule tho[s]e romantic girls who fooli[s]hly imagine a red coat and [s]ilver epaulet con[s]titute the fine gentleman; and [s]hould that fine gentleman make half a dozen fine [s]peeches to them, they will imagine them[s]elves [s]o much in love as to fancy it a meritorious action to jump out of a two pair of [s]tairs [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] window, abandon their friends, and tru[s]t entirely to the honour of a man, who perhaps hardly knows the meaning of the word, and if he does, will be too much the modern man of refinement, to practi[s]e it in their favour. Gracious heaven! when I think on the mi[s]eries that mu[s]t rend the heart of a doating parent, when he [s]ees the darling of his age at fir[s]t [s]educed from his protection, and afterwards abandoned, by the very wretch who[s]e promi[s]es of love decoyed her from the paternal roof---when he [s]ees her poor and wretched, her bo[s]om torn between remor[s]e for her crime and love for her vile betrayer---when fancy paints to me the good old man [s]tooping to rai[s]e the weeping penitent, while every tear from her eye is numbered by drops from his bleeding heart, my bo[s]om glows with hone[s]t indignation, and I wi[s]h for power to extirpate tho[s]e mon[s]ters of [s]eduction from the earth. Oh my dear girls---for to [s]uch only am I writing--- li[s]ten not to the voice of love, unle[s]s [s]anctioned by paternal approbation: be a[s][s]ured, it is now pa[s]t the days of romance: no woman can be run away with contrary to her own inclination: then kneel down each morning, and reque[s]t kind heaven to keep you free from temptation, or, [s]hould it plea[s]e to [s]uffer you to be tried, pray for fortitude to re[s]i[s]t the impul[s]e of inclination when it runs counter to the precepts of religion and virtue. NATURAL SENSE OF PROPRIETY INHERENT IN THE FEMALE BOSOM.

"It was your own fault, then," replied Mademoiselle: "for I am [s]ure my cou[s]in omitted nothing that could [s]erve to render the evening agreeable." "True," [s]aid Charlotte: "but I thought the gentlemen were very free in their manner: I wonder you would [s]uffer them to behave as they did." "Prithee, don't be [s]uch a fooli[s]h little prude," [s]aid the artful woman, affecting anger: "I invited you to go in hopes it would divert you, and be an agreeable change of [s]cene; however, if your delicacy was hurt by the behaviour of the gentlemen, you need not go again; [s]o there let it re[s]t." "I do not intend to go again," [s]aid Charlotte, gravely taking off her bonnet, and beginning to prepare for bed: "I am [s]ure, if Madame Du Pont knew we had been out to-night, [s]he would be very angry; and it is ten to one but [s]he hears of it by [s]ome means or other."

This was touching Charlotte in the mo[s]t vulnerable part: [s]he ro[s]e from her [s]eat, and taking Mademoiselle's hand---"You know, my dear La Rue," [s]aid [s]he, "I love you too well, to do any thing that would injure you in my governe[s]s's opinion: I am only [s]orry we went out this evening." "I don't believe it, Charlotte," [s]aid [s]he, assuming a little vivacity; "for if you had not gone out, you would not have [s]een the gentleman who met us cro[s][s]ing the field; and I rather think you were plea[s]ed with his conver[s]ation."

But," [s]aid [s]he pau[s]ing, and drawing the letter from her pocket, while a gentle [s]uffu[s]ion of vermillion tinged her neck and face, "he gave me this letter; what [s]hall I do with it? "Read it, to be [s]ure," returned Mademoi[s]elle. "I am afraid I ought not," [s]aid Charlotte: "my mother has often told me, I [s]hould never read a letter given me by a young man, without fir[s]t giving it to her." "Lord ble[s]s you, my dear girl," cried the teacher [s]miling, "have you a mind to be in leading [s]trings all your life time. Prithee open the letter, read it and judge for your[s]elf; if you [s]how it your mother, the con[s]equence will be, you will be taken from [s]chool, and a [s]trict guard kept over you: [s]o you will [s]tand no chance of ever [s]eeing the [s]mart young officer again." "I [s]hould not like to leave [s]chool yet," replied Charlotte, "till I have attained a greater proficiency in my Italian and mu[s]ic. But you can, if you plea[s]e, Mademoi[s]elle, take the letter back to Montraville, and tell him I wi[s]h him well, but cannot, with any propriety, enter into a clandestine corre[s]pondence with him." She laid the letter on the table, and began to undre[s]s her[s]elf. "Well," [s]aid La Rue, "I vow you are an unaccountable girl: have you no curio[s]ity to [s]ee the in[s]ide now? for my part I could no more let a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] letter addre[s][s]ed to me lie unopened [s]o long, than I could work miracles: he writes a good hand," continued [s]he, turning the letter, to look at the [s]uper[s]cription. "'Tis well enough," [s]aid Charlotte, drawing it towards her. "He is a genteel young fellow," [s]aid La Rue carele[s]sly, folding up her apron at the [s]ame time; "but I think he is marked with the [s]mall pox." "Oh you are greatly mi[s]taken," [s]aid Charlotte eagerly; "he has a remarkable clear [s]kin and fine complexion." "His eyes, if I could judge by what I [s]aw," [s]aid La Rue, "are gray and want expre[s][s]ion." "By no means," replied Charlotte; "they are the mo[s]t expre[s][s]ive eyes I ever [s]aw." "Well, child, whether they are gray or black is of no con[s]equence: you have determined not to read his letter; [s]o it is likely you will never either [s]ee or hear from him again." Charlotte took up the letter, and Mademoi[s]elle continued--- "He is mo[s]t probably going to America: and if ever you [s]hould hear any account of him, it may po[s][s]ibly be that he is killed; and though he loved you ever [s]o fervently, though his la[s]t breath [s]hould be [s]pent in a prayer for your happine[s]s, it can be nothing to you: you can feel nothing for the fate of the man, who[s]e letters you will not open, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] who[s]e [s]ufferings you will not alleviate, by permitting him to think you would remember him when ab[s]ent, and pray for his [s]afety." Charlotte [s]till held the letter in her hand: her heart [s]welled at the conclu[s]ion of Mademoi[s]elle's [s]peech, and a tear dropped upon the wafer that clo[s]ed it. "The wafer is not dry yet," [s]aid [s]he, "and [s]ure there can be no great harm---" She hesitated. La Rue was [s]ilent. "I may read it, Mademoiselle, and return it afterwards." "Certainly," replied Mademoi[s]elle. "At any rate I am determined not to an[s]wer it," continued Charlotte, as [s]he opened the letter. Here let me [s]top to make one remark, and tru[s]t me my very heart aches while I write it; but certain I am, that when once a woman has [s]tifled the [s]en[s]e of [s]hame in her own bo[s]om, when once [s]he has lo[s]t [s]ight of the ba[s]is on which reputation, honour, every thing that [s]hould be dear to the female heart, re[s]ts, [s]he grows hardened in guilt, and will [s]pare no pains to bring down innocence and beauty to the [s]hocking level with her[s]elf: and this proceeds from that diabolical [s]pirit of envy, which repines at [s]eeing another in the full possession of that re[s]pect and e[s]teem which [s]he can no longer hope to enjoy. Mademoi[s]elle eyed the un[s]u[s]pecting Charlotte, as [s]he peru[s]ed the letter, with a malignant plea[s]ure.

DOMESTIC PLEASURE PLANNED. "I Think, my dear," [s]aid Mrs. Temple, laying her hand on her hu[s]band's arm as they were walking together in the garden, "I think next Wedne[s]day is Charlotte's birth day: now I have formed a little [s]cheme in my own mind, to give her an agreeable [s]urpri[s]e; and if you have no objection, we will [s]end for her home on that day." Temple pre[s][s]ed his wife's hand in token of approbation, and [s]he proceeded.---"You know the little alcove at the bottom of the garden, of which Charlotte is [s]o fond? I have an inclination to deck this out in a fanciful manner, and invite all her little friends to partake of a collation of fruit, sweetmeats, and other things [s]uitable to the general ta[s]te of young gue[s]ts; and to make it more plea[s]ing to Charlotte, [s]he [s]hall be mi[s]tre[s]s of the fea[s]t, and entertain her vi[s]itors in this alcove. I know [s]he will be delighted; and to complete all, they [s]hall have [s]ome mu[s]ic, and fini[s]h with a dance."

You will quite [s]poil her, Lucy; indeed you will." "She is the only child we have," [s]aid Mrs. Temple, the whole tenderne[s]s of a mother adding animation to her fine countenance; but it was withal tempered [s]o [s]weetly with the meek affection and [s]ubmi[s][s]ive duty of the wife, that as [s]he pau[s]ed expecting her hu[s]band's an[s]wer, he gazed at her tenderly, and found he was unable to refu[s]e her reque[s]t. "She is a good girl," [s]aid Temple. "She is, indeed," replied the fond mother exultingly, "a grateful, affectionate girl; and I am [s]ure will never lo[s]e [s]ight of the duty [s]he owes her parents." "If [s]he does," [s]aid he, "[s]he mu[s]t forget the example [s]et her by the be[s]t of mothers." Mrs. Temple could not reply; but the delightful [s]en[s]ation that dilated her heart [s]parkled in her intelligent eyes, and heightened the vermillion on her cheeks. Of all the plea[s]ures of which the human mind is [s]en[s]ible, there is none equal to that which warms and expands the bo[s]om, when li[s]tening to commendations be[s]towed on us by a beloved object, and are con[s]cious of having de[s]erved them.

Has [s]he not always eluded your gra[s]p, and when you have reached your hand to take the cup [s]he extends to her deluded votaries, have you not found the long-expected draught [s]trongly tinctured with the bitter dregs of di[s]appointment? I know you have: I [s]ee it in the wan cheek, [s]unk eye, and air of chagrin, which ever mark the children of dissipation.

Look, my dear friends, at yonder lovely Virgin arrayed in a white robe devoid of ornament; behold the meekne[s]s of her countenance, the modesty of her gait; her handmaids are Humility, Filial Piety, Conjugal Affection, Indu[s]try  and Benevolence ; her name is Content; [s]he holds in her hand the cup of true felicity, and when once you have formed an intimate acquaintance with the[s]e her attendants, nay, you mu[s]t admit them as your bo[s]om friends and chief coun[s]ellors, then, whatever may be your [s]ituation in life, the meek eyed Virgin will immediately take up her abode with you.

Is your [s]tate mediocrity?---[s]he will heighten every ble[s][s]ing you enjoy, by informing you how grateful you [s]hould be to that bountiful Providence who might have placed you in the mo[s]t abject [s]ituation; and, by teaching you to weigh your ble[s][s]ings again[s]t your de[s]erts, [s]how you how much more you receive than you have a right to expect.

She will pa[s]s with you through life, [s]moothing the rough paths and tread to earth tho[s]e thorns which every one mu[s]t meet with as they journey onward to the appointed goal. She will [s]often the pains of [s]ickne[s]s, continue with you even in the cold gloomy hour of death, and, chearing you with the [s]miles of her heaven-born [s]i[s]ter, Hope, lead you triumphant to a bli[s]sful eternity.

The very ba[s]is of true peace of mind is a benevolent wi[s]h to [s]ee all the world as happy as one's [s]elf; and from my [s]oul do I pity the [s]elfi[s]h churl, who, remembering the little bickerings of anger, envy, and fifty other di[s]agreeables to which frail mortality is subject, would wi[s]h to revenge the affront which pride whi[s]pers him he has received. For my own part, I can [s]afely declare, there is not a human being in the univer[s]e, who[s]e pro[s]perity I [s]hould not rejoice in, and to who[s]e happine[s]s I would not contribute to the utmo[s]t limit of my power: and may my offences be no more remembered in the day of general retribution, than as from my [s]oul I forgive every offence or injury received from a fellow creature. Merciful heaven! who would exchange the rapture of [s]uch a reflexion for all the gaudy tin[s]el which the world calls plea[s]ure! But to return.---Content dwelt in Mrs. Temple's bo[s]om, and [s]pread a charming animation over her countenance, as her hu[s]band led her in, to lay the plan [s]he had formed (for the celebration of Charlotte's birth day,) before Mr. Eldridge. WE KNOW NOT WHAT A DAY MAY BRING FORTH. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] Various were the [s]en[s]ations which agitated the mind of Charlotte, during the day preceding the evening in which [s]he was to meet Montraville. Several times did [s]he almo[s]t re[s]olve to go to her governe[s]s, [s]how her letter, and be guided by her advice: but Charlotte had taken one [s]tep in the ways of imprudence; and when that is once done, there are always innumerable ob[s]tacles to prevent the erring per[s]on returning to the path of rectitude: yet the[s]e ob[s]tacles, however forcible they may appear in general, exi[s]t chiefly in imagination. Charlotte feared the anger of her governe[s]s: [s]he loved her mother, and the very idea of incurring her di[s]plea[s]ure, gave her the greate[s]t unea[s]ine[s]s; but there was a more forcible rea[s]on [s]till remaining: [s]hould [s]he [s]how the letter to Madame Du Pont, [s]he mu[s]t confe[s]s the means by which it came into her po[s][s]e[s][s]ion; and what would be the con[s]equence? Mademoi[s]elle would be turned out of doors. "I mu[s]t not be ungrateful," [s]aid [s]he, "La Rue is very kind to me; be[s]ides I can, when I [s]ee Montraville inform him of the impropriety of our continuing to [s]ee or corre[s]pond with each other, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] and reque[s]t him to come no more to Chiche[s]ter." However prudent Charlotte might be in the[s]e re[s]olutions, [s]he certainly did not take a proper method to confirm her[s]elf in them. Several times in the cour[s]e of the day [s]he indulged her[s]elf in reading over the letter, and each time [s]he read it, the contents funk deeper in her heart. As evening drew near, [s]he caught her[s]elf frequently con[s]ulting her watch. "I wi[s]h this fooli[s]h meeting was over," [s]aid [s]he, by way of apology to her own heart, "I wi[s]h it was over; for when I have [s]een him, and convinced him my re[s]olution is not to be [s]haken, I [s]hall feel my mind much ea[s]ier. The appointed hour arrived. Charlotte and Mademoiselle eluded the eye of vigilance; and Montraville who had waited their coming with impatience, received them with rapturous and unbounded acknowledgments for their conde[s]cen[s]ion: he had wi[s]ely brought Belcour with him to entertain Mademoiselle while he enjoyed an uninterrupted conversation with Charlotte. Belcour was a man who[s]e character might be compri[s]ed in a few words; and as he will make [s]ome figure in the en[s]uing pages, I [s]hall here describe him. He po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a genteel fortune, and had a liberal education; di[s][s]ipated, thoughtle[s]s, and capricious, he paid little regard to the moral duties, and le[s]s to religious ones: eager in the pur[s]uit of pleasure, he minded not the mi[s]eries he inflicted on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] others, provided his own wi[s]hes, however extravagant, were gratified. Self, darling [s]elf, was the idol he wor[s]hipped, and to that he would have [s]acrificed the intere[s]t and happine[s]s of all mankind. Such was the friend of Montraville: will not the reader be ready to imagine, that the man who could regard [s]uch a character, mu[s]t be actuated by the [s]ame feelings, follow the [s]ame pur[s]uits, and be equally unworthy with the per[s]on to whom he thus gave his confidence? But Montraville was a different character: generous in his di[s]po[s]ition, liberal in his opinions, and good-natured almo[s]t to a fault; yet eager and impetuous in the pur[s]uit of a favourite object, he [s]taid not to reflect on the con[s]equence which might follow the attainment of his wi[s]hes; with a mind ever open to conviction, had he been [s]o fortunate as to po[s][s]e[s]s a friend who would have pointed out the cruelty of endeavouring to gain the heart of an innocent artle[s]s girl, when he knew it was utterly impo[s][s]ible for him to marry her, and when the gratification of his pa[s][s]ion would be unavoidable infamy and mi[s]ery to her, and a cau[s]e of neverceasing remor[s]e to him[s]elf: had the[s]e dreadful consequences been placed before him in a proper light, the humanity of his nature would have urged him to give up the pur[s]uit: but Belcour was not this friend; he rather encouraged the growing pa[s][s]ion of Montraville; and being plea[s]ed with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] vivacity of Mademoi[s]elle, re[s]olved to leave no argument untried, which he thought might prevail on her to be the companion of their intended voyage: and he made no doubt but her example, added to the rhetoric of Montraville, would per[s]uade Charlotte to go with them. Charlotte had, when [s]he went out to meet Montraville, flattered her[s]elf that her re[s]olution was not to be [s]haken, and that, con[s]cious of the impropriety of her conduct in having a clande[s]tine intercourse with a [s]tranger, [s]he would never repeat the indi[s]cretion. But alas! poor Charlotte, [s]he knew not the deceitfulness of her own heart, or [s]he would have avoided the trial of her [s]tability. Montraville was tender, eloquent, ardent, and yet re[s]pectful. "Shall I not [s]ee you once more,"' [s]aid he, "before I leave England? will you not ble[s]s me by an a[s][s]urance, that when we are divided by a va[s]t expan[s]e of [s]ea I [s]hall not be forgotten?" Charlotte [s]ighed. "Why that [s]igh, my dear Charlotte? could I flatter my[s]elf that a fear for my [s]afety, or a wi[s]h for my welfare occa[s]ioned it, how happy would it make me." "I [s]hall ever wi[s]h you well, Montraville," [s]aid [s]he; "but we mu[s]t meet no more." "Oh [s]ay not [s]o, my lovely girl: reflect, that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] when I leave my native land, perhaps a few [s]hort weeks may terminate my exi[s]tence; the perils of the ocean---the dangers of war---" "I can hear no more," [s]aid Charlotte in a tremulous voice, "I mu[s]t leave you." "Say you will [s]ee me once again." "I dare not," [s]aid [s]he. "Only for one half hour to-morrow evening: 'tis my la[s]t reque[s]t. I [s]hall never trouble you again, Charlotte." "I know not what to [s]ay," cried Charlotte, [s]truggling to draw her hands from him: "let me leave you now." "And you will come to-morrow," [s]aid Montraville. "Perhaps I may," [s]aid [s]he. "Adieu then. I will live upon that hope till we meet again." He ki[s][s]ed her hand. She [s]ighed an adieu, and catching hold of Mademoi[s]elle's arm, ha[s]tily entered the garden gate. WHEN WE HAVE EXCITED CURIOSITY, IT IS BUT AN ACT OF GOOD NATURE TO GRATIFY IT. Montraville was the younge[s]t [s]on of a gentleman of fortune, who[s]e family being [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] numerous, he was obliged to bring up his [s]ons to genteel profe[s][s]ions, by the exerci[s]e of which they might hope to rai[s]e them[s]elves into notice. "My daughters," [s]aid he, "have been educated like gentlewomen; and [s]hould I die before they are [s]ettled, they mu[s]t have [s]ome provi[s]ion made, to place them above the [s]nares and temptations which vice ever holds out to the elegant, accompli[s]hed female, when oppre[s][s]ed by the frowns of poverty and the [s]ting of dependance: my boys, with only moderate incomes, when placed in the church, at the bar, or in the field, may exert their talents, make them[s]elves friends, and rai[s]e their fortunes on the ba[s]is of merit." When Montraville cho[s]e the pro[s]e[s][s]ion of arms, his father pre[s]ented him with a commi[s][s]ion, and made him a hand[s]ome provi[s]ion for his private pur[s]e. "Now, my boy," [s]aid he, "go! [s]eek glory in the field of battle. You have received from me all I [s]hall ever have it in my power to be[s]tow: it is certain I have intere[s]t to gain you promotion; but be a[s][s]ured that intere[s]t [s]hall never be exerted, unle[s]s by your future conduct you de[s]erve it. Remember, therefore, your [s]ucce[s]s in life depends entirely on your[s]elf. There is one thing I think it my duty to caution you again[s]t; the precipitancy with which young men frequently ru[s]h into matrimonial engagements, and by their thoughtle[s][s]ne[s]s draw many a de[s]erving woman [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] into [s]cenes of poverty and di[s]tre[s]s. A [s]oldier has no bu[s]ine[s]s to think of a wife till his rank is [s]uch as to place him above the fear of bringing into the world a train of helple[s]s innocents, heirs only to penury and affliction. If, indeed, a woman, who[s]e fortune is [s]ufficient to pre[s]erve you in that [s]tate of independence I would teach you to prize, [s]hould generou[s]ly be[s]tow her[s]elf on a young soldier, who[s]e chief hope of future pro[s]perity depended on his [s]ucce[s]s in the field---if [s]uch a woman [s]hould offer---every barrier is removed, and I [s]hould rejoice in an union which would promi[s]e [s]o much felicity. But mark me, boy, if, on the contrary, you ru[s]h into a precipitate union with a girl of little or no fortune, take the poor creature from a comfortable home and kind friends, and plunge her into all the evils a narrow income and increa[s]ing family can inflict, I will leave you to enjoy the ble[s][s]ed fruits of your ra[s]hne[s]s; for by all that is [s]acred, neither my intere[s]t or fortune [s]hall ever be exerted in your favour. I am [s]erious," continued he, "therefore imprint this conver[s]ation on your memory, and let it influence your future conduct. Your happine[s]s will always be dear to me; and I wi[s]h to warn you of a rock on which the peace of many an hone[s]t fellow has been wrecked; for believe me, the difficulties and dangers of the longe[s]t winter campaign are much ea[s]ier to be borne, than the pangs that would [s]eize your heart, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] when you beheld the woman of your choice, the children of your affection, involved in penury and di[s]tre[s]s, and reflected that it was your own folly and precipitancy had been the prime cau[s]e of their [s]ufferings." As this conver[s]ation pa[s][s]ed but a few hours before Montraville took leave of his father, it was deeply impre[s][s]ed on his mind: when, therefore, Belcour came with him to the place of a[s][s]ignation with Charlotte, he directed him to enquire of the French woman what were Mi[s]s Temple's expectations in regard to fortune. Mademoi[s]elle informed him, that though Charlotte's father po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a genteel independence, it was by means probable that he could give his daughter more than a thou[s]and pounds; and in ca[s]e [s]he did not marry to his liking, it was po[s][s]ible he might not give her a [s]ingle [s]ous; nor did it appear the lea[s]t likely, that Mr. Temple would agree to her union with a young man on the point of embarking for the [s]eat of war. Montraville therefore concluded it was impo[s][s]ible he [s]hould ever marry Charlotte Temple; and what end he propo[s]ed to him[s]elf by continuing the acquaintance he had commenced with her, he did not at that moment give him[s]elf time to enquire. CONFLICT OF LOVE AND DUTY. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] Almost a week was now gone, and Charlotte continued every evening to meet Montraville, and in her heart every meeting was re[s]olved to be the la[s]t; but alas! when Montraville at parting would earne[s]tly intreat one more interview, that treacherous heart betrayed her; and, forgetful of its re[s]olution, pleaded the cau[s]e of the enemy [s]o powerfully, that Charlotte was unable to re[s]i[s]t. Another and another meeting [s]ucceeded; and [s]o well did Montraville improve each opportunity, that he heedle[s]s girl at length confe[s][s]ed no idea could be [s]o painful to her as that of never seeing him again. "Then we will never be parted," [s]aid he. "Ah, Montraville," replied Charlotte, forcing a [s]mile, "how can it be avoided? My parents would never con[s]ent to our union; and even could they be brought to approve of it, how [s]hould I bear to be [s]eparated from my kind, my beloved mother?" "Then you love your parents more than you do me, Charlotte?" "I hope I do," [s]aid [s]he, blu[s]hing and looking down, "I hope my affection for them will ever keep me from infringing the laws of filial duty." "Well, Charlotte," [s]aid Montraville gravely, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] and letting go her hand, "[s]ince that is the ca[s]e, I find I have deceived my[s]elf with fallacious hopes. I had flattered my fond heart, that I was dearer to Charlotte than any thing in the world be[s]ide. I thought that you would for my [s]ake have braved the dangers of the ocean, that you would, by your affection and [s]miles, have [s]oftened the hardships of war, and, had it been my [s]ate to fall, that your tenderne[s]s would chear the hour of death and [s]mooth my pa[s][s]age to another world. But farewel, Charlotte! I [s]ee you never loved me. I [s]hall now welcome the friendly ball that deprives me of the [s]en[s]e of my mi[s]ery." "Oh [s]tay, unkind Montraville," cried [s]he catching hold of his arm, as he pretended to leave her, "[s]tay, and to calm your fears, I will here prote[s]t that was it not for the fear of giving pain to the be[s]t of parents, and returning their kindne[s]s with ingratitude, I would follow you through every danger, and, in [s]tudying to promote your happine[s]s, in[s]ure my own. But I cannot break my mother's heart, Montraville; I mu[s]t not bring the grey hairs of my doating grand-father with sorrow to the grave, or make my beloved father perhaps cur[s]e the hour that gave me birth." She covered her face with her hands, and bur[s]t into tears. "All the[s]e di[s]tre[s][s]ing [s]cenes, my dear Charlotte," cried Montraville, "are merely the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] chimeras of a di[s]turbed fancy. Your parents might perhaps grieve at fir[s]t; but when they heard from your own hand that you was with a man of honour, and that it was to in[s]ure your felicity by an union with him, to which you feared they would never have given their a[s][s]ent, that you left their protection, they will, be a[s][s]ured, forgive an error which love alone occa[s]ioned, and when we return from America, receive you with open arms and tears of joy." "Belcour and Mademoi[s]elle heard this la[s]t [s]peech, and conceiving it a proper time to throw in their advice and per[s]ua[s]ions, approached Charlotte, and [s]o well [s]econded the intreaties of Montraville, that finding Mademoi[s]elle intended going with Belcour, and feeling her own treacherous heart too much inclined to accompany them, the haple[s]s Charlotte, in an evil hour con[s]ented that the next evening they [s]hould bring a chai[s]e to the end of the town, and that [s]he would leave her friends, and throw her[s]elf entirely on the protection of Montraville. "But [s]hould you," [s]aid [s]he, looking earne[s]tly at him, her eyes full of tears, "[s]hould you, forgetful of your promi[s]es, and repenting the engagements you here voluntarily enter into, for[s]ake and leave me on a foreign [s]hore---" "Judge not [s]o meanly of me," [s]aid he. "The moment we reach our place of de[s]tination, Hymen [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] [s]hall [s]anctify our love: and when I [s]hall forget your goodne[s]s, may heaven forget me." "Ah," [s]aid Charlotte, leaning on Mademoi[s]elle's arm as they walked up the garden together, "I have forgot all that I ought to have remembered, in con[s]enting to this intended elopement." "You are a [s]trange girl," [s]aid Mademoi[s]elle: "you never know your own mind two minutes at a time. Ju[s]t now you declared Montraville's happine[s]s was what you prized mo[s]t in the world; and now I [s]uppo[s]e you repent having in[s]ured that happine[s]s by agreeing to accompany him abroad." "Indeed I do repent," replied Charlotte, "from my [s]oul: but while di[s]cretion points out the impropriety of my conduct, inclination urges me on to ruin." "Ruin! fiddle[s]tick?" [s]aid Mademoi[s]elle; "am not I going with you? and do I feel any of the[s]e qualms?" "You do not renounce a tender father and mother," [s]aid Charlotte. "But I hazard my dear reputation," replied Mademoi[s]elle, bridling. "True," replied Charlotte, "but you do not [s]eel what I do." She then bade her good night: but [s]leep was a [s]tranger to her eyes, and the tear of anguish watered her pillow. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] Nature's la[s]t, be[s]t gift: Creature in whom excell'd, whatever could To [s]ight or thought be nam'd! Holy, divine! good, amiable, and [s]weet! How thou art fall'n!--- When Charlotte left her re[s]tle[s]s bed, her languid eye and pale cheek di[s]covered to Madame Du Pont the little repo[s]e [s]he had ta[s]ted. "My dear child," [s]aid the affectionate governess, "what is the cau[s]e of the langour [s]o apparent in your frame? Are you not well?" "Yes, my dear Madam, very well," replied Charlotte, attempting to [s]mile, "but I know not how it was; I could not [s]leep la[s]t night, and my spirits are depre[s][s]ed this morning." "Come chear up, my love," [s]aid the governe[s]s; "I believe I have brought a cordial to revive them. I have ju[s]t received a letter from your good mama, and here is one for your[s]elf." Charlotte ha[s]tily took the letter: it contained the[s]e words--- "As to-morrow is the anniver[s]ary of the happy day that gave my beloved girl to the anxious wi[s]hes of a maternal heart, I have reque[s]ted your governe[s]s to let you come home and [s]pend it with us; and as I know you to be a good affectionate child, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] make it your [s]tudy to improve in tho[s]e branches of education which you know will give mo[s]t plea[s]ure to your delighted parents, as a reward for your diligence and attention I have prepared an agreeable [s]urpri[s]e for your reception. Your grand-father, eager to embrace the darling of his aged heart, will come in the chai[s]e for you: [s]o hold your[s]elf in readine[s]s to attend him by nine o'clock. Your dear father joins in every tender wi[s]h for your health and future felicity, which warms the heart of my dear Charlotte's affectionate mother, L. TEMPLE." "Gracious heaven!" cried Charlotte, forgetting where [s]he was, and rai[s]ing her [s]treaming eyes as in carne[s]t [s]upplication. Madame Du Pont was [s]urpri[s]ed. "Why the[s]e tears, my love?" [s]aid [s]he. "Why this [s]eeming agitation? I thought the letter would have rejoiced, in[s]tead of di[s]tre[s][s]ing you. "It does rejoice me," replied Charlotte, endeavouring at compo[s]ure, "but I was praying for merit to de[s]erve the unremitted attentions of the be[s]t of parents." "You do right," [s]aid Madame Du Pont, "to a[s]k the a[s][s]i[s]tance of heaven that you may continue to de[s]erve their love. Continue, my dear Charlotte, in the cour[s]e you have ever pur[s]ued, and you will in[s]ure at once their happine[s]s and your own." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] "Oh!" cried Charlotte, as her governe[s]s leftlier, "I have for[s]eited both for ever! Yet let me reflect:---the irrevocable [s]tep is not yet taken: it is not too late to recede from the brink of a precipice, from which I can only behold the dark aby[s]s of ruin, [s]hame, and remor[s]e!" She aro[s]e from her [s]eat, and flew to the apartment of La Rue. "Oh Mademoi[s]elle!" [s]aid [s]he, "I am [s]natched by a miracle from de[s]truction! This letter has [s]aved me: it has opened my eyes to the folly I was [s]o near committing. I will not go, Mademoi[s]elle: I will not wound the hearts of tho[s]e dear parents who make my happine[s]s the whole [s]tudy of their lives." "Well," [s]aid Mademoi[s]elle, "do as you plea[s]e, Mi[s]s; but pray under[s]tand that my re[s]olution is taken, and it is not in your power to alter it. I [s]hall meet the gentlemen at the appointed hour, and [s]hall not be [s]urprized at any outrage which Montraville may commit, when he finds him[s]elf di[s]appointed. Indeed I [s]hould not be astonished, was he to come immediately here, and reproach you for your in[s]tability in the hearing of the whole [s]chool: and what will be the consequence? you will bear the odium of having formed the re[s]olution of eloping, and every girl of [s]pirit will laugh at your want of fortitude to put it in execution, while prudes and fools will load you with reproach and contempt. You will have lo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] the confidence of your parents, incurred their anger, and the [s]coffs of the world; and what fruit do you expect to reap from this piece of heroi[s]m; (for [s]uch no doubt you think it is?) you will have the plea[s]ure to reflect, that you have deceived the man who adores you, and whom in your heart you prefer to all other men, and that you are [s]eparated from him for ever." This eloquent harangue was given with [s]uch volubility, that Charlotte could not find an opportunity to interrupt her, or to offer a [s]ingle word till the whole was fini[s]hed, and then found her ideas [s]o con[s]u[s]ed, that [s]he knew not what to [s]ay. At length [s]he determined that [s]he would go with Mademoi[s]elle to the place of a[s][s]ignation, convince Montraville of the nece[s][s]ity of adhering to the resolution of remaining behind; a[s][s]ure him of her affection, and bid him adieu. Charlotte formed this plan in her mind, and exulted in the certainty of its [s]ucce[s]s. "How [s]hall I rejoice," [s]aid [s]he, "in this triumph of rea[s]on over inclination, and when in the arms of my affectionate parents, lift up my [s]oul in gratitude to heaven as I look back on the dangers I have e[s]caped! The hour of a[s][s]ignation arrived: Mademoi[s]elle put what money and valuables [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed in her pocket, and advi[s]ed Charlotte to do the [s]ame; but [s]he re[s]u[s]ed: "my re[s]olution is fixed," [s]aid [s]he; I will [s]acrifice love to duty." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] Mademoi[s]elle [s]miled internally; and they proceeded [s]oftly down the back [s]tairs and out of the garden gate. Montraville and Belcour was ready to receive them. "Now," [s]aid Montraville, taking Charlotte in his arms, "you are mine forever." "No," [s]aid [s]he, withdrawing from his embrace "I am come to take an everla[s]ting farewel." It would be u[s]ele[s]s to repeat the conver[s]ation that here en[s]ued; [s]uffice it to [s]ay, that Montraville u[s]ed every argument that had formerly been [s]ucce[s]sful, Charlotte's re[s]olution began to waver, and he drew her almo[s]t imperceptibly towards the chai[s]e. "I cannot go," [s]aid [s]he: "cea[s]e, dear Montraville, to per[s]uade. I mu[s]t not: religion, duty, forbid." "Cruel Charlotte," [s]aid he, "if you di[s]appoint my ardent hopes, by all that is [s]acred, this hand [s]hall put a period to my exi[s]tence. I cannot---will not live without you." "Alas! my torn heart!" [s]aid Charlotte, "how [s]hall I act?" "Let me direct you," [s]aid Montraville, lifting her into the chai[s]e. "Oh! my dear for[s]aken parents!" cried Charlotte. The chai[s]e drove off. She [s]hrieked, and fainted into the arms of her betrayer. CRUEL DISAPPOINTMENT. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] " What plea[s]ure," cried Mr. Eldridge, as he [s]tepped into the chai[s]e to go for his grand-daughter, "what plea[s]ure expands the heart of an old man when he beholds the progeny of a beloved child growing up in every virtue that adorned the minds of her parents. I fooli[s]hly thought, [s]ome few years [s]ince, that every [s]en[s]e, of joy was buried in the graves of my dear partner and my [s]on; but my Lucy, by her [s]ilial affection, [s]oothed my [s]oul to peace, and this dear Charlotte has twined her[s]elf round my heart, and opened [s]uch new [s]cenes of delight to my view, that I almo[s]t forget I have ever been unhappy." When the chai[s]e [s]topped, he alighted with the alacrity of youth; [s]o much do the emotions of the [s]oul influence the body. It was half pa[s]t eight o'clock: the ladies were assembled in the [s]chool room, and Madame Du Pont was preparing to offer the morning [s]acrifice of prayer and prai[s]e, when it was di[s]covered, that Mademoiselle and Charlotte were mi[s][s]ing. "She is bu[s]y, no doubt," [s]aid the governe[s]s, "in preparing Charlotte for her little excur[s]ion; but plea[s]ure [s]hall never make us forget our duty to our Creator. Go, one of you, and bid them both attend prayers." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] The lady who went to [s]ummen them, [s]oon returned, and informed the governe[s]s, that the room was locked, and that [s]he had knocked repeatedly, but obtained no an[s]wer. "Good heaven!" cried Madame Du Pont, "this is very [s]trange:" and turning pale with terror, [s]he went ha[s]tily to the door and ordered it to be forced open. The apartment in[s]tantly discovered, that no per[s]on had been in it the preceding night, the beds appearing as though ju[s]t made. The hou[s]e was in[s]tantly a [s]cene of con[s]u[s]ion: the garden, the plea[s]ure grounds were [s]earched to no purpose, every apartment rung with the names of Mi[s]s Temple and Mademoi[s]elle; but they were too di[s]tant to hear; and every face wore the marks of di[s]appointment. Mr. Eldridge was [s]itting in the parlour, eagerly expecting his grand-daughter to de[s]cend, ready equipped for her journey: he heard the con[s]u[s]ion that reigned in the hou[s]e; he heard the name of Charlotte frequently repeated. "What can be the matter?" [s]aid he, ri[s]ing and opening the door: "I fear [s]ome accident has befallen my dear girl." The governe[s]s entered. The vi[s]ible agitation of her countenance di[s]covered that [s]omething extraordinary had happened. "Where is Charlotte?" [s]aid he, "Why does not my child come to welcome her doating parent?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] "Be compo[s]ed, my dear Sir," [s]aid Madame Du Pont, "do not frighten your[s]elf unnecessarily. She is not in the hou[s]e at pre[s]ent; but as Mademoi[s]elle is undoubtedly with her, [s]he will [s]peedily return in [s]afety; and I hope they will both be able to account for this un[s]ea[s]onable absence in [s]uch a manner as [s]hall remove our pre[s]ent unea[s]ine[s]s. "Madam," cried the old man, with an angry look, "has my child been accu[s]tomed to go out without leave, with no other company or protector than that French woman. Pardon me, Madam, I mean no reflections on your country, but I never did like Mademoi[s]elle La Rue; I think [s]he was a very improper per[s]on to be entru[s]ted with the care of [s]uch a girl as Charlotte Temple, or to be [s]uffered to take her from under your immediate protection." "You wrong me, Mr. Eldridge," [s]aid [s]he, "If you [s]uppo[s]e I have ever permitted your grand-daughter to go out unle[s]s with the other ladies. I would to heaven I could form any probable conjecture concerning her ab[s]ence this morning, but it is a my[s]tery which her return can alone unravel." Servants were now di[s]patched to every place where there was the lea[s]t hope of hearing any tidings of the fugitives, but in vain. Dreadful were the hours of horrid [s]u[s]pen[s]e which Mr. Eldridge pa[s][s]ed till twelve o'clock, when that [s]u[s]pen[s]e was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] reduced to a [s]hocking certainty, and every [s]park of hope which till then they had indulged, was in a moment extingui[s]hed. Mr. Eldridge was preparing with a heavy heart, to return to his anxiou[s]ly-expecting children, when Madame Du Pont received the following note without either name or date. "Mi[s]s Temple is well and wi[s]hes to relieve the anxiety of her parents, by letting them know [s]he has voluntarily put her[s]elf under the protection of a man who[s]e future [s]tudy [s]hall be to make her happy. Pur[s]uit is needle[s]s; the mea[s]ures taken to avoid di[s]covery are too effectual to be eluded. When [s]he thinks her friends are reconciled to this precipitate [s]tep, they may perhaps be informed of her place of re[s]idence. Mademoi[s]elle is with her." As Madame Du Pont read the[s]e cruel lines, [s]he turned pale as a[s]hes, her limbs trembled, and [s]he was forced to call for a gla[s]s of water. She loved Charlotte truly: and when [s]he reflected on the innocence and gentlene[s]s of her di[s]po[s]ition, [s]he concluded that it mu[s]t have been the advice and machinations of La Rue, which led her to this imprudent action; [s]he recollected her agitation at the receipt of her mother's letter, and [s]aw in it the conflict of her mind. "Does that letter relate to Charlotte?" [s]aid Mr. Eldridge, having waited [s]ome time in expectation of Madame Du Pont's [s]peaking. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] "It does," [s]aid [s]he. "Charlotte is well, but cannot return to-day." "Not return, Madam? where is [s]he? who will detain her from her fond expecting parents?" "You di[s]tract me with the[s]e que[s]tions, Mr. Eldridge. Indeed I know not where [s]he is, or who has [s]educed her from her duty." The whole truth now ru[s]hed at once upon Mr. Eldridge's mind. "She has eloped then," [s]aid he "My child is betrayed; the darling, the comfort of my aged heart, is lo[s]t. Oh would to heaven I had died but ye[s]terday." A violent gu[s]h of grief in [s]ome mea[s]ure relieved him, and, after [s]everal vain attempts, he at length a[s][s]umed [s]ufficient compo[s]ure to read the note. "And how [s]hall I return to my children?" [s]aid he: "how approach that man[s]ion, [s]o late the habitation of peace? Alas! my dear Lucy, how will you [s]upport the[s]e heart-rending tidings? or how [s]hall I be enabled to con[s]ole you, who need [s]o much con[s]olation my[s]elf?" The old man returned to the chai[s]e, but the light [s]tep and chearful countenance were no more; sorrow filled his heart, and guided his motions; he [s]eated him[s]elf in the chai[s]e, his venerable head reclined upon his bo[s]om, his hands were folded, his eye fixed on vacancy, and the large drops of [s]orrow rolled [s]ilently down his cheeks. There was a mixture of angui[s]h and re[s]ignation depicted in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] his countenance, as if he would [s]ay, henceforth who [s]hall dare to boa[s]t his happine[s]s, or even in idea contemplate his trea[s]ure, left, in the very moment his heart is exulting in its own felicity, the object which con[s]titutes that felicity [s]hould be torn from him. MATERNAL SORROW. Slow and heavy pa[s][s]ed the time while the carriage was conveying Mr. Eldridge home; and yet when he came in [s]ight of the hou[s]e, he wi[s]hed a longer reprieve from the dreadful ta[s]k of informing Mr. and Mrs. Temple of their daughter's clopement. It is ea[s]y to judge the anxiety of the[s]e affectionate parents, when they found the return of their father delayed [s]o much beyond the expected time. They were now met in the dining parlour, and [s]everal of the young people who had been invited were already arrived. Each different part of the company was employed in the [s]ame manner, looking out at the windows which faced the road. At length the long-expected chai[s]e appeared. Mrs. Temple ran out to receive and welcome her darling: her young companions flocked round the door, each one eager to give her joy on the return of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] birth-day. The door of the chai[s]e was opened: Charlotte was not there. "Where is my child?" cried Mrs. Temple, in breathle[s]s agitation. Mr. Eldridge could not an[s]wer: he took hold of his daughter's hand and led her into the hou[s]e; and [s]inking on the fir[s]t chair he came to, bur[s]t into tears, and [s]obbed aloud. "She is dead," cried Mrs. Temple. "Oh my dear Charlotte!" and cla[s]ping her hands in an agony of di[s]tre[s]s, fell into [s]trong hy[s]terics. Mr. Temple who had [s]tood [s]peechle[s]s with [s]urprize and fear, now ventured to enquire if indeed his Charlotte was no more. Mr. Eldridge led him into another apartment; and putting the fatal note into his hand, cried---"Bear it like a Chri[s]tian, and turned from him, endeavouring to [s]uppre[s]s his own too vi[s]ible emotions. It would be vain to attempt de[s]cribing what Mr. Temple felt whil[s]t he ha[s]tily ran over the dreadful lines: when he had fini[s]hed, the paper dropt from his unnerved hand. "Gracious heaven!" [s]aid he, "could Charlotte act thus?" Neither tear nor [s]igh e[s]caped him; and he [s]at the image of mute [s]orrow, till rou[s]ed from his [s]tupor by the repeated [s]hrieks of Mrs. Temple. He ro[s]e ha[s]tily, and ru[s]hing into the apartment where [s]he was, folded his arms about her and [s]aying---"Let us be patient, my dear Lucy," nature relieved his almo[s]t bur[s]ting heart by a friendly gu[s]h of tears. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] Should any one, pre[s]uming on his own philo[s]ophic temper, look with an eye of contempt on the man who could indulge a woman's weakne[s]s, let him remember that man was a father, and he will then pity the mi[s]ery which wrung tho[s]e drops from a noble, generous heart. Mrs. Temple beginning to be a little more composed, but [s]till imagining her child was dead, her hu[s]band, gently taking her hand, cried---"You are mi[s]taken, my love. Charlotte is not dead." "Then [s]he is very ill, el[s]e why did [s]he not come? But I will go to her: the chai[s]e is [s]till at the door: let me go in[s]tantly to the dear girl. If I was ill, [s]he would fly to attend me, to alleviate my [s]ufferings, and chear me with her love." "Be calm, my deare[s]t Lucy, and I will tell you all," [s]aid Mr. Temple. "You mu[s]t not go, indeed you mu[s]t not: it will be of no u[s]e." "Temple," [s]aid [s]he, a[s][s]uming a look of firmne[s]s and compo[s]ure, "tell me the truth I be[s]eech you. I cannot bear this dreadful [s]u[s]pen[s]e. What misfortune has befallen my child? Let me know the wor[s]t, and I will endeavour to bear it as I ought." "Lucy," replied Mr. Temple, "imagine your daughter alive, and in no danger of death: what misfortune would you then dread?" "There is one misfortune which is wor[s]e than death. But I know my child too well to [s]u[s]pect---" "Be not too confident, Lucy." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] "Oh heavens!" [s]aid [s]he, "what horrid images do you [s]tart: is it po[s][s]ible [s]he [s]hould forget---" "She has forgot us all, my love; [s]he has preferred the love of a [s]tranger to the affectionate protection of her friends." "Not cloped?" cried [s]he eagerly. Mr. Temple was [s]ilent. "You cannot contradict it," [s]aid [s]he. "I [s]ee my fate in tho[s]e tearful eyes. Oh Charlotte! Charlotte! how ill have you requited our tenderne[s]s! But, Father of Mercies," continued [s]he, [s]inking on her knees, and rai[s]ing her [s]treaming eyes and cla[s]ped hands to heaven, "this once vouch[s]a[s]e to hear a fond, a di[s]tracted mother's prayer. Oh let thy bounteous Providence watch over and protect the dear thoughtle[s]s girl, [s]ave her from the mi[s]eries which I fear will be her portion, and oh! of thine infinite mercy, make her not a mother, le[s]t [s]he [s]hould one day feel what I now [s]uffer." The la[s]t words faultered on her tongue, and [s]he fell fainting into the arms of her hu[s]band, who had involuntarily dropped on his knees be[s]ide her. A mother's angui[s]h, when di[s]appointed in her tendere[s]t hopes none but a mother can conceive. Yet, my dear young readers, I would have you read this [s]cene with attention, and reflect that you may your[s]elves one day be mothers. Oh my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] friends, as you value your eternal happine[s]s, wound not, by thoughtle[s]s ingratitude, the peace of the mother who bore you: remember the tenderness, the care the unremitting anxiety with which [s]he has attended to all your wants and wi[s]hes from earlie[s]t infancy to the pre[s]ent day; behold the mild ray of affectionate applau[s]e that beams from her eye on the performance of your duty: li[s]ten to her reproofs with [s]ilent attention; they proceed from a heart anxious for your future felicity: you mu[s]t love her; nature, all-powerful nature, has planted the [s]eeds of filial affection in your bo[s]oms. Then once more read over the [s]orrows of poor Mrs. Temple, and remember the mother whom you [s]o dearly love and venerate will feel the [s]ame, when you, forgetful of the re[s]pect due to your maker and your[s]elf, for[s]ake the paths of virtue for tho[s]e of vice and folly. EMBARKATION. It was with the utmo[s]t difficulty that the united efforts of Mademoi[s]elle and Montraville could [s]upport Charlotte's [s]pirits during their [s]hort ride from Chiche[s]ter to Port[s]mouth, where a boat waited to take them immediately on board the [s]hip in which they were to embark for America. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] As [s]oon as [s]he became tolerably compo[s]ed, [s]he entreated pen and ink to write to her parents. This [s]he did in the mo[s]t affecting, artle[s]s manner, entreating their pardon and ble[s][s]ing, and de[s]cribing the dreadful [s]ituation of her mind, the conflict [s]he [s]uffered in endeavouring to conquer this unfortunate attachment, and concluded with [s]aying, her only hope of future comfort con[s]i[s]ted in the (perhaps delusive) idea [s]he indulged, of being once more folded in their protecting arms, and hearing the words of peace and pardon from their lips. The tears [s]treamed ince[s][s]antly while [s]he was writing, and [s]he was frequently obliged to lay down her pen: but when the ta[s]k was completed, and [s]he had committed the letter to the care of Montraville to be [s]ent to the po[s]t office, [s]he became more calm, and indulging the delightful hope of [s]oon receiving an an[s]wer that would [s]eal her pardon, [s]he in [s]ome mea[s]ure a[s][s]umed her u[s]ual chearfulne[s]s. But Montraville knew too well the con[s]equences that mu[s]t unavoidably en[s]ue, [s]hould this letter reach Mr. Temple: he therefore wi[s]ely re[s]olved to walk on the deck, tear it in pieces, and commit the fragments to the care of Neptune, who might or might not, as it [s]uited his convenience, convey them on [s]hore. All Charlotte's hopes and wi[s]hes were now centered in one, namely that the fleet might be detained at Spithead till [s]he could receive a letter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] from her friends: but in this [s]he was di[s]appointed, for the [s]econd morning after [s]he went on board, the [s]ignal was made, the fleet weighed anchor, and in a few hours (the wind being favourable) they bid adieu to the white cliffs of Albion. In the mean time every enquiry that could be thought of was made by Mr. and Mrs. Temple: for many days did they indulge the fond hope that [s]he was merely gone off to be married, and that when the indi[s][s]oluble knot was once tied, [s]he would return with the partner [s]he had cho[s]en, and entreat their ble[s][s]ing and forgivene[s]s. "And [s]hall we not forgive her?" [s]aid Mr. Temple. "Forgive her!" exclaimed the mother. "Oh yes, whatever be our errors, is [s]he not our child? and though bowed to the earth even with [s]hame and remor[s]e, is it not our duty to rai[s]e the poor penitent, and whi[s]per peace and comfort to her de[s]ponding [s]oul? would [s]he but return, with rapture would I fold her to my heart, and bury every remembrance of her faults in the dear embrace." But [s]till day after day pa[s][s]ed on, and Charlotte did not appear, nor were any tidings to be heard of her: yet each ri[s]ing morning was welcomed by [s]ome new hope---the evening brought with it disappointment. At length hope was no more; despair u[s]urped her place; and the man[s]ion which was once the man[s]ion of peace, became the habitation of pale, dejected melancholy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] The chearful [s]mile that was wont to adorn the face of Mrs. Temple was [s]led, and had it not been for the [s]upport of unaffected piety, and a consciousness of having ever [s]et before her child the fairest example, [s]he mu[s]t have [s]unk under this heavy affliction. "Since," [s]aid [s]he, "the [s]evere[s]t [s]crutiny cannot charge me with any breach of duty to have de[s]erved this [s]evere cha[s]tizement, I will bow before the power who inflicts it with humble resignation to his will; nor [s]hall the duty of a wife be totally ab[s]orbed in the feelings of the mother; I will endeavour to appear more chearful, and by appearing in [s]ome mea[s]ure to have conquered my own [s]orrow, alleviate the [s]ufferings of my hu[s]band, and rou[s]e him from that torpor into which this misfortune has plunged him. My father too demands my care and attention: I mu[s]t not, by a [s]el[s]i[s]h indulgence of my own grief, forget the interest tho[s]e two dear objects take in my happine[s]s or mi[s]ery: I will wear a [s]mile on my face, though the thorn rankles in my heart: and if by [s]o doing, I in the [s]malle[s]t degree contribute to re[s]tore their peace of mind, I [s]hall be amply rewarded for the pain the concealment of my own feelings may occa[s]ion. Thus argued this excellent woman: and in the execution of [s]o laudable a re[s]olution we [s]hall leave her, to follow the fortunes of the haple[s]s victim of imprudence and evil coun[s]ellors. NECESSARY DIGRESSION. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] On board of the [s]hip in which Charlotte and Mademoi[s]elle were embarked, was an officer of large unincumbered fortune and elevated rank, and whom I [s]hall call Crayton. He was one of tho[s]e men, who having travelled in their youth, pretend to have contracted a peculiar fondne[s]s for every thing foreign, and to hold in contempt the productions of their own country; and this affected partiality extended even to the women. With him therefore the blu[s]hing, mode[s]ty and unaffected [s]implicity of Charlotte pa[s][s]ed unnoticed; but the forward pertne[s]s of La Rue, the freedom of her conver[s]ation, the elegance of her per[s]on, mixed with a certain engaging je ne [s]ais quoi , perfectly enchanted him. The reader no doubt has already developed the character of La Rue; de[s]igning, artful, and [s]el[s]i[s]h, [s]he had accepted the devoirs of Belcour becau[s]e [s]he was heartily weary of the retired life [s]he led at the [s]chool, wi[s]hed to be relea[s]ed from what [s]he deemed a [s]lavery, and to return to that vortex of folly and di[s][s]ipation which had once plunged her into the deepe[s]t mi[s]ery; but her plan [s]he flattered her[s]elf was now better formed: [s]he re[s]olved to put her[s]elf under the protection of no man till [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] had fir[s]t [s]ecured a [s]ettlement; but the clande[s]tine manner in which [s]he left Madame Du Pont's prevented her putting this plan in execution, though Belcour [s]olemnly prote[s]ted he would make her a hand[s]ome [s]ettlement the moment they arrived at Port[s]mouth. This he afterwards contrived to evade by a pretended hurry of bu[s]ine[s]s; La Rue readily conceiving he never meant to fulfil his promi[s]e, determined to change her battery, and attack the heart of Colonel Crayton, She [s]oon discovered the partiality he entertained for her nation; and having impo[s]ed on him a feigned tale of di[s]tre[s]s, repre[s]enting Belcour as a villain who had [s]educed her from her friends under promi[s]e of marriage, and afterwards betrayed her, pretending great remor[s]e for the errors [s]he had committed, and declaring whatever her affection for Belcour might have been, it was now entirely extingui[s]hed, and [s]he wi[s]hed for nothing more than an opportunity to leave a cour[s]e of life which her [s]oul abhorred; but [s]he had no friends to apply to, they had all renounced her, and guilt and mi[s]ery would undoubtedly be her future portion through life. Crayton was po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of many amiable qualities, though the peculiar trait in his character, which we have already mentioned, in a great mea[s]ure threw a [s]hade over them. He was beloved for his humanity and benevolence by all who knew him, but he was ea[s]y and un[s]u[s]picious him[s]elf, and became a dupe to the artifice of others. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] He was, when very young, united to an amiable Pari[s]ian lady, and perhaps it was his affection for her that laid the foundation for the partiality he ever retained for the whole nation. He had by her one daughter, who entered into the world but a few hours before her mother left it. This lady was universally beloved and admired, being endowed with all the virtues of her mother, without the weakne[s]s of the father: [s]he was married to Major Beauchamp, and was at this time in the [s]ame fleet with her father, attending her hu[s]band to New-York. Crayton was melted by the affected contrition and di[s]tre[s]s of La Rue: he would conver[s]e with her for hours, read to her, play cards with her, li[s]ten to all her complaints, and promi[s]e to protect her to the utmo[s]t of his power. La Rue ea[s]ily [s]aw his character; her [s]ole aim was to awaken a pa[s][s]ion in his bo[s]om that might turn out to her advantage, and in this aim [s]he was but too [s]ucce[s]sful, for before the voyage was fini[s]hed the infatuated Colonel gave her from under his hand a promi[s]e of marriage on their arrival at New-York, under forfeiture of five thousand pounds. And how did our poor Charlotte pa[s]s her time during a tedious and tempe[s]tuous pa[s][s]age? naturally delicate, the fatigue and [s]ickne[s]s which [s]he endured rendered her [s]o weak as to be almo[s]t entirely confined to her bed: yet the kindne[s]s and attention of Montraville in [s]ome mea[s]ure contributed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] to alleviate her [s]ufferings, and the hope of hearing from her friends [s]oon after her arrival, kept up her [s]pirits, and cheered many a gloomy hour. But during the voyage a great revolution took place not only in the fortune of La Rue but in the bo[s]om of Belcour: whil[s]t in pur[s]uit of his amour with Mademoi[s]elle, he had attended little to the intere[s]ting, inobtru[s]ive charms of Charlotte, but when, cloyed by po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and di[s]gu[s]ted with the art and di[s][s]imulation of one, he beheld the simplicity and gentlene[s]s of the other, the contra[s]t became too [s]triking not to fill him at once with [s]urpri[s]e and admiration. He frequently conver[s]ed with Charlotte; he found her [s]en[s]ible, well informed, but diffident and una[s][s]uming. The languor which the fatigue of her body and perturbation of her mind [s]pread over her delicate features, [s]erved only in his opinion to render her more lovely: he knew that Montraville did not de[s]ign to marry her, and he formed a re[s]olution to endeavour to gain her him[s]elf whenever Montraville [s]hould leave her. Let not the reader imagine Belcour's de[s]igns were honourable. Alas! when once a woman has forgot the re[s]pect due to her[s]elf, by yielding to the [s]olicitations of illieit love, they lo[s]e all their consequence, even in the eyes of the man who[s]e art has betrayed them, and for who[s]e [s]ake they have [s]acrificed every valuable con[s]ideration. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] The heedle[s]s Fair, who [s]toops to guilty joys, A man may pity---but he mu[s]t de[s]pi[s]e. Nay, ever libertine will think he has a right to in[s]ult her with his licentious pa[s][s]ion; and [s]hould the unhappy creature [s]hrink from the in[s]olent overture, he will [s]neeringly taunt her with pretence of mode[s]ty. A WEDDING. On the day before their arrival at New-York, after dinner, Crayton aro[s]e from his [s]eat, and placing him[s]elf by Mademoi[s]elle, thus addre[s][s]ed the company--- "As we are now nearly arrived at our de[s]tined port, I think it but my duty to inform you, my friends, that this lady," (taking her hand,) "has placed her[s]elf under my protection. I have [s]een and [s]everely felt the angui[s]h of her heart, and through every [s]hade which cruelty or malice may throw over her, can di[s]cover the mo[s]t amiable qualities. I thought it but nece[s][s]ary to mention my e[s]teem for her before our di[s]embarkation, as it is my fixed re[s]olution, the morning after we land, to give her an undoubted title to my favour and protection by honourably uniting my fate to hers. I would wi[s]h every gentleman here therefore to remember that her honour henceforth is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] mine, and," continued he, looking at Belcour, "[s]hould any man pre[s]ume to [s]peak in the lea[s]t, disrespectful of her, I [s]hall not he[s]itate to pronounce him a [s]coundrel." Belcour ca[s]t at him a [s]mile of contempt, and bowing profoundly low, wi[s]hed Mademoi[s]elle much joy in the propo[s]ed union; and a[s][s]uring the Colonel that he need not be in the lea[s]t apprehen[s]ive of any one throwing the lea[s]t odium on the character of his lady, [s]hook him by the hand with ridiculous gravity, and left the cabin. The truth was he was glad to be rid of La Rue, and [s]o he was but freed from her, he cared not who fell a victim to her infamous arts. The inexperienced Charlotte was a[s]toni[s]hed at what [s]he heard. She thought La Rue had, like her[s]elf, only been urged by the force of her attachment to Belcour, to quit her friends, and follow him to the [s]eat of war: how wonderful then, that [s]he [s]hould re[s]olve to marry another man. It was certainly extremely wrong. It was indelicate. She mentioned her thoughts to Montraville. He laughed at her [s]implicity, called her a little ideot, and patting her on the cheek, [s]aid [s]he knew nothing of the world. "If the world [s]anctifies [s]uch things, 'tis a very bad world I think," [s]aid Charlotte. "Why I always under[s]tood that they were to have been married when they arrived at New-York. I am [s]ure Mademoi[s]elle told me Belcour promi[s]ed to marry her." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] "Well, and [s]uppo[s]e he did?" "Why, he [s]hould be obliged to keep his word I think." "Well, but I [s]uppo[s]e he has changed his mind," [s]aid Montraville, "and then you know the ca[s]e is altered." Charlotte looked at him attentively for a moment. A full [s]en[s]e of her own [s]ituation ru[s]hed upon her mind. She bur[s]t into tears, and remained [s]ilent. Montraville too well under[s]tood the cau[s]e of her tears. He ki[s][s]ed her cheek, and bidding her not make her[s]elf unea[s]y, unable to bear the [s]ilent but keen remon[s]trance, ha[s]tily left her. The next morning by [s]un-ri[s]e they found themselves at anchor before the city of New-York. A boat was ordered to convey the ladies on [s]hore. Crayton accompanied them; and they were [s]hewn to a hou[s]e of public entertainment. Scarcely were they [s]eated when the door opened, and the Colonel found him[s]elf in the arms of his daughter, who had landed a few minutes before him. The fir[s]t transport of meeting [s]ub[s]ided, Crayton introduced his daughter to Mademoi[s]elle La Rue, as an old friend of her mother's, (for the artful French woman had really made it appear to the credulous Colonel that [s]he was in the [s]ame convent with his fir[s]t wife, and, though much younger, had received many tokens of her e[s]teem and regard.) "If, Mademoi[s]elle," [s]aid Mrs. Beauchamp, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf325v1&image=325-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] "you were the friend of my mother, you mu[s]t be worthy the e[s]teem of all good hearts." "Mademoi[s]elle will [s]oon honour our family," [s]aid Crayton, "by [s]upplying the place that valuable woman filled: and as you are married, my dear, I think you will not blame---" "Hu[s]h, my dear Sir," replied Mrs. Beauchamp: "I know my duty too well to [s]crutinize your conduct. Be a[s][s]ured, my dear father, your happine[s]s is mine. I [s]hall rejoice in it, and sincerely love the per[s]on who contributes to it. But tell me," continued [s]he, turning to Charlotte, who is this lovely girl? Is [s]he your [s]i[s]ter, MadeMoiselle?" A blu[s]h, deep as the glow of the carnation, suffused the cheeks of Charlotte. "It is a young lady," replied the Colonel, "who came in the [s]ame ve[s][s]el with us from England." He then drew his daughter a[s]ide, and told her in a whi[s]per, Charlotte was the mi[s]tre[s]s of Montraville. "What a pity!" [s]aid Mrs. Beauchamp [s]oftly, (ca[s]ting a mo[s]t compa[s][s]ionate glance at her.) "But [s]urely her mind is not depraved. The goodness of her heart is depicted in her ingenuous countenance." "Charlotte caught the word pity. "And am I already fallen [s]o low?" [s]aid [s]he. A [s]igh e[s]caped her, and a tear was ready to [s]tart, but [
