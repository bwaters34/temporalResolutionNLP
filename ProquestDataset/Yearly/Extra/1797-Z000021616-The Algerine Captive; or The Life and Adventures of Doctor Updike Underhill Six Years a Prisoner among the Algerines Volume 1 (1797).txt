In Europe, dedications have their price; and the author oftener looks to the plenitude of the pockets, than the brains of his patron. The American author can hope but little pecuniary emolument from even the [s]ale, and not any from the dedication of his work. To adorn his book with the name of [s]ome gentleman, of acknowledged merit, involves his whole intere[s]t, in a public addre[s]s. With this view, will you, Sir, permit a lover of the Mu[s]es, and a biographer of private life, to addre[s]s to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page iv. ] you (a Poet and the Biographer of a Hero) a detail of tho[s]e mi[s]eries of [s]lavery, from which your public energies have principally conduced to liberate hundreds of our fellow citizens.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page v. ] One of the fir[s]t observations, the author of the following [s]heets made, upon his return to his native country, after an ab[s]ence of [s]even years, was the extreme avidity, with which books of mere amusement were purcha[s]ed and peru[s]ed by all ranks of his countrymen. When he left New England, books of Biography, Travels, Novels, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page vi. ] modern Romances, were confined to our [s]ea ports; or, if known in the country, were read only in the families of Clergymen, Phy[s]icians, and Lawyers: while certain funeral discourses, the la[s]t words and dying [s]peeches of Bryan Shaheen, and Levi Ames, and [s]ome dreary somebody's Day of Doom, formed the mo[s]t diverting part of the farmer's library. On his return from captivity, he found a [s]urpri[s]ing alteration in the public ta[s]te. In our inland towns of con[s]equence, [s]ocial libraries had been in[s]tituted, compo[s]ed of books, de[s]igned to amu[s]e rather than to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page vii. ] instruct; and country book[s]ellers, foltering the new born ta[s]te of the people, had filled the whole land with modern Travels, and Novels almo[s]t as incredible. The diffu[s]ion of a ta[s]te, for any [s]pecies of writing, through all ranks, in [s]o [s]hort a time, would appear impracticable to a European. The pea[s]ant of Europe mu[s]t fir[s]t be taught to read, before he can acquire a ta[s]te in letters. In New England, the work is half completed. In no other country are there [s]o many people, in proportion to its numbers, who can read and write; and therefore, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page viii. ] no [s]ooner was a ta[s]te for amu[s]ing literature diffu[s]ed than all orders of country life, with one accord, sorsook the [s]ober [s]ermons and Practical Pieties of their fathers, for the gay [s]tories and [s]plendid impieties of the Traveller and the Noveli[s]t. The worthy farmer no longer [s]atigued him[s]elf with Bunyan's Pilgrim up the "hill of difficulty" or through the "[s]lough of de[s]pond;" but quaffed wine with Brydone in the hermitage of Ve[s]uvius, or [s]ported with Bruce on the fairy land of Abysinia: while Dolly, the diary maid, and Jonathan, the hired man, threw [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page ix. ] aside the ballad of the cruel stepmother, over which they had [s]o often wept in concert, and now amused them[s]elves into [s]o agreeable a terrour, with the haunted hou[s]es and hobgobblins of Mrs. Ratcliffe, that they were both afraid to [s]leep alone. While this love of literature, however frivolous, is plea[s]ing to the man of letters, there are two things to be deplored. The fir[s]t is that, while [s]o many books are vended, they are not of our own manufacture. If our wives and daughters [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page x. ] will wear gauze and ribbands, it is a pity, they are not wrought in our own looms. The [s]econd misfortune is that Novels, being the picture of the times, the New England reader is in[s]en[s]ibly taught to admire the levity, and often the vices of the parent country. While the fancy is enchanted, the heart is corrupted. The farmer's daughter, while [s]he pities the misfortune of [s]ome modern heroine, is expo[s]ed to the attacks of vice, from which her ignorance would have formed her fare[s]t [s]hield. If the Engli[s]h Novel does not inculcate vice, it at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page xi. ] lea[s]t impre[s][s]es on the young mind an erroneous idea of the world, in which [s]he is to live. It paints the manners, cu[s]toms, and habits of a [s]trange country; excites a fondne[s]s for fal[s]e [s]plendour; and renders the home[s]pun habits of her own country di[s]gu[s]ting. There are two things wanted, [s]aid a friend to the author: that we write our own books of amu[s]ement, and that they exhibit our own manners. Why then do you not write the hi[s]tory of your own life? The fir[s]t part of it, if not highly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page xii. ] interesting, would at lea[s]t di[s]play a portrait of New England manners, hitherto unattempted. Your captivity among the Algerines, with [s]ome notices of the manners of that ferocious race, [s]o dreaded by commercial powers, and [s]o little known in our country, would be intere[s]ting; and I [s]ee no advantage the Novel writer can have over you, unle[s]s your readers [s]hould be of the [s]entiment of the young lady, mentioned by Addi[s]on in his [s]pectator, who, he informs us, borrowed Plutarch's lives; and, after reading the fir[s]t volume, with infinite delight, [s]uppo[s]ing it to be a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page xiii. ] Novel, threw a[s]ide the others with di[s]gu[s]t, becau[s]e a man of letters had inadvertently told her, the work was founded on FACT.

My honoured ance[s]tor had early imbibed an ardent love of liberty, civil and religious, by his [s]ervice as a [s]oldier among the Dutch, in their glorious and successful [s]truggle for freedom, with Philip the [s]econd of Spain; when, though quite a youth, he held a commi[s][s]ion in the Earl of Leice[s]ter's own troop of guards, who was then [s]ent to the a[s][s]i[s]tance of that brave people, by the renowned Queen Elizabeth of England. The extravagant pa[s][s]ion, which that prince[s]s was [s]uppo[s]ed to entertain for various male favourites, which occa[s]ioned the di[s]grace of one, and the premature death of another, while it has furnished a darling theme to the noveli[s]t, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] has been wept over in the tragic [s]cene, has never yet received the [s]ober [s]anction of the hi[s]torian. A traditional family anecdote, while it places the affection of the queen for Leice[s]ter beyond doubt, may not be unpleasing to the learned reader, and may benefit the Engli[s]h hi[s]toriographer. It is well known that this crafty queen, though repeatedly [s]olicited, never efficaciously a[s][s]i[s]ted the Netherlanders, until their affairs were apparently at the lowe[s]t ebb, and they in [s]uch de[s]perate circumstances, as to offer the [s]overeignty of their country to her general, the Earl of Leice[s]ter. Captain Underhill carried the di[s]patches to England, and delivered them at the office of Lord Burleigh. The [s]ame evening, the queen [s]ent for the captain, and, with apparent perturbation, inquired of him, if he was the me[s][s]enger from Leice[s]ter, and whether he had any private di[s]patches for her. He replied, that he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] had delivered all his letters to the secretary of [s]tate. She appeared much disappointed, and, after mu[s]ing [s]ome time, [s]aid, "So Leice[s]ter wants to be a king." Underhill, who was in the general's confidence, replied that the Dutch had indeed made the offer of the [s]overeignty of their country to her general---e[s]teeming it a great honour, as they [s]aid, to have a subject of her grace for their [s]overeign. No, replied the queen, it is not the Dutch; they hate kings and their divine right; it is the proud Leice[s]ter, who yearns to be independent of his own [s]overeign, who moves this in[s]olent propo[s]al. Tell him, from me, that he mu[s]t learn to obey, before he is [s]it to govern. Tell him, added the queen, [s]oftening her voice, that obedience may make him a king indeed . Immediately after Captain Underhill had taken the public di[s]patches, the queen [s]ent for him to her privy clo[s]et, recalled her verbal me[s][s]age, delivered him a letter for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] Leice[s]ter, directed with her own hand, and a pur[s]e of one hundred crowns for him[s]elf; charging him to enclo[s]e the letter in lead, [s]ink it in ca[s]e of danger in his pa[s][s]age by [s]ea, and to deliver it privately. On the receipt of this letter, Leice[s]ter was violently agitated, walked his chamber the whole of the en[s]uing night. Soon after, he re[s]igned his command, and returned to England, animated by the brighte[s]t hopes of realizing the lofty [s]ugge[s]tions of his ambition. With him Captain Underhill returned, and upon the decea[s]e of the Earl of Leice[s]ter, attached him[s]elf to the fortunes of the Earl of E[s][s]ex, the unfortunate [s]ucce[s][s]our to Leice[s]ter in the queen's favour. He accompanied that gallant nobleman in his [s]ucce[s]sful attack upon Cadiz, and [s]hared his ill fortune in his fruitle[s]s expedition again[s]t Tyronne, the rebel chief of the revolted clans of Ireland; and, returning with the Earl into England, by his attachment to that imprudent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] nobleman, [s]allying into the [s]treets of London in the petty in[s]urrection, which co[s]t E[s][s]ex his head, he was obliged to [s]eek [s]afety in Holland, until the acce[s][s]ion of King James, in one thou[s]and [s]ix hundred and three, when he applied for pardon and leave to return to his native country. But that monarch entertained [s]uch an exalted idea of the dignity of kings, and from policy, affected [s]o great a veneration for the memory of his predece[s][s]or, that no intere[s]t of his friends could procure his pardon for an offence, which, in this day and country, would be con[s]idered a [s]imple rout or riot, and puni[s]hed with a [s]mall fine, in that age of kingly glory was [s]uppo[s]ed to combine trea[s]on and blasphemy: trea[s]on again[s]t the queen in her political capacity, and bla[s]phemy against her as God's repre[s]entative and vicegerent on earth. The Reverend Mr. Robin[s]on, with a number of other pious puritans, having [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] fled, from the per[s]ecuting fury of the English prelates, to Holland, in one thou[s]and [s]ix hundred and three, he dwelt and communed with them a number of years. He was [s]trongly [s]olicited to go with Governour Carver, Elder Brew[s]ter, and the other worthies, part of Mr. Robin[s]on's church, to the [s]ettlement of Plymouth, and had partly engaged with them, as their chief military officer; but, Captain Miles Standi[s]h, his brave fellow [s]oldier in the low countries, undertaking the bu[s]ine[s]s, he declined. How he joined Governour Winthrop, does not appear, but he came over to New England with him, and [s]oon after we find him di[s]ciplining the Bo[s]ton militia, where he was held in [s]uch high e[s]timation that he was cho[s]en to repre[s]ent that town in the general court; but, his ideas of religious toleration being more liberal than tho[s]e around him, he lo[s]t his popularity, and was, on the twentieth of November, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] one thou[s]and [s]ix hundred and thirty seven, disfranchi[s]ed and eventually bani[s]hed the juri[s]diction of Ma[s][s]achu[s]etts. The writers of tho[s]e times differ, as to the particular offence for which he was puni[s]hed. Some [s]ay that it was for holding the antinomian tenets of the celebrated Ann Hutchin[s]on, others that the charge again[s]t him was for [s]aying, That the government at Bo[s]ton were as zealous as the [s]cribes and phari[s]ees, and as Paul before his conver[s]ion  . The be[s]t account, I have been able to collect, is, that at the time when the zeal of our worthy forefathers burned the ho tte[s]t again[s]t heretics and [s]ectaries, when good Roger Williams, who [s]ettled Providence, the pious Wheelwright, and others, were bani[s]hed, he, with about [s]ixty other imprudent per[s]ons, who did not believe in the then popular arguments of fines, impri[s]onment, disfranchisement, confi[s]cation, bani[s]hments, and halters for the conver[s]ion of infidels, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] [s]uppo[s]ed that the chri[s]tian faith, which had [s]pread [s]o wonderfully in its infancy, when the [s]word of civil power was drawn again[s]t it, in that age, [s]urrounded by numerous pro[s]elites, needed not the [s]ame [s]word un[s]heathed in its favour. The[s]e mi[s]taken people [s]igned a remon[s]trance against the violent proceedings, which were the order of that day. William A[s]pinwall and John Cogge[s]hell, two of the Bo[s]ton repre[s]entatives, who [s]igned the remonstrance, were [s]ent home, and the town ordered to choo[s]e others in their room. Some of the remon[s]trants recanted, [s]ome were fined, [s]ome were disfranchi[s]ed, and others, among whom was Captain Underhill, were bani[s]hed. It is [s]aid by [s]ome authors, that he was charged with the heinous crime of adultery, and that he even confe[s][s]ed it. The candid American author, above named, has fallen into this error. As I am [s]ure it mu[s]t have given him pain to [s]peak evil [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] even of the dead  , [s]o I am certain he will rectify this mi[s]take in the next edition of his invaluable hi[s]tory. That author informs us, page forty three of his fir[s]t volume, "That he, Captain Underhill, was privately dealt with, on suspicion of adultery, which he di[s]regarded, and therefore on the next [s]abbath was questioned for it before the church; but the evidence not being [s]ufficient to convict him, the church could only admoni[s]h him."---Page forty five, "He went to Bo[s]ton, and in the [s]ame public manner acknowledged his adultery. But his confession was mixed with [s]o many excu[s]es and extenuations, that it gave no satisfaction." The unwary reader would perhaps conclude, that actual adultery was intended, as well as expre[s][s]ed, in the[s]e extracts. The Reverend author him[s]elf did not advert to the idea, that the moral law of Bo[s]ton, in one thou[s]and [s]ix hundred and thirty [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] seven, was not [s]o lax as the moral law of the [s]ame place, in one thou[s]and [s]even hundred and eighty four, as explained by the practice of its inhabitants. The rigid discipline of our fathers of that era often construed actions, expre[s][s]ions, and [s]ometimes thoughts, into crimes; which actions in this day, even the mo[s]t preci[s]e would con[s]ider either innocent, indifferent, or beneath the dignity of official notice. The fact is, that Captain Underhill, [s]o far from CONFESSING, was never charged with committing actual [s]tatute book adultery. At a certain lecture in Bo[s]ton, in[s]tead of noting the referred texts in his bible, according to the profitable cu[s]tom of the times, this gallant [s]oldier had fixed his eyes [s]tedfa[s]tly, and perhaps inordinately, upon one Mi[s]tre[s]s Miriam Wilbore; who it [s]eems was, at that very time, her[s]elf in the breach of the [s]pirit of an exi[s]ting law, which forbad women to appear in public with uncovered arms and necks, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] by appearing at the [s]ame lecture with a pair of wanton open worked gloves, [s]lit at the thumbs and fingers, for the conveniency of taking [s]nuff; though [s]he was not charged with the latter crime of using tobacco. It was the ADULTERY OF THE HEART, of which my gallant ance[s]tor was accu[s]ed, and [s]ounded on that text of [s]cripture, "Who[s]oever looketh on a woman to lu[s]t after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."

The general court, April 1 [s]t, 1633, granted him fifty acres of land, near where his hou[s]e [s]tood; [s]uppo[s]ed to be where the pe[s]t hou[s]e in Bo[s]ton formerly [s]tood.---He afterwards removed to Rhode I[s]land, and lived near Whipple's bridge in Cumberland.---He planted the fir[s]t orchard in that di[s]trict, the fruit of which was caten of one hundred and forty years afterwards, and [s]ome of the trees are now [s]tanding.---He had been a mini[s]ter of the church of England, preached often at Providence, and died in a good old age much lamented. It is with great reluctance I am induced to publi[s]h this letter, which appears to reflect upon the ju[s]tice of the proceedings of our forefathers. I would rather, like the [s]ons of Noah, go backwards and ca[s]t a garment over our fathers' nakedness; but the impartiality of a hi[s]torian, and the natural [s]olicitude to wipe the [s]tains from the memory of my honoured [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] ance[s]tor, will excu[s]e me to the candid Whoever reflects upon the piety of our forefathers, the noble unre[s]trained ardour, with which they re[s]i[s]ted oppre[s][s]ion in England, relinqui[s]hed the delights of their native country, cro[s][s]ed a boisterous ocean, penetrated a [s]avage wilderness, encountered famine, pe[s]tilence, and Indian warfare, and tran[s]mitted to us their [s]entiments of independence, that love of liberty, which under God enabled us to obtain our own glorious freedom, will readily pa[s]s over tho[s]e few dark [s]pots of zeal, which clouded their rising [s]un.

Fir[s]t, by writing injurious letters to tho[s]e he governed; by threats of their power; and la[s]tly, by determining that Dover was within the juri[s]diction of Ma[s][s]achu[s]etts, they forced him to [s]lee to Albany, then po[s][s]e[s][s]ed by the Dutch, under the name of Amboyna. The Dutch were highly plea[s]ed with the Captain, and after Dutchifying his name into Captain Hans Van Vanderhill, they gave him a command of one hundred and twenty men, in their wars with the natives. It is [s]aid that he killed one hundred and fifty Indians on Long I[s]land, and upwards of three hundred on the Main. The laurels of the famous Colonel Church wither in compari[s]on. The Dutch granted him fifty thou[s]and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] acres of land, then in their po[s][s]e[s][s]ion. Although the Engli[s]h, when they took possession of that country for the Duke of York, afterwards James the [s]econd, had promised to quiet the claims of the [s]ettlers; yet Captain Underhill, or his po[s]terity, have never availed them[s]elves of the grant.--- Mentioning this circum[s]tance, [s]ometime [s]ince in Hartford, [s]ome gentlemen immediately offered to rai[s]e a company and purcha[s]e my right. I candidly confessed that I was not po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of the title, and knew not the particular [s]pot where the land lay, and con[s]equently was unwilling to [s]ell land without title or boundaries. To my [s]urpri[s]e they laughed at my [s]cruples, and ob[s]erved that they wanted the land to [s]peculate upon, to [s]ell , and not to [s]ettle . Titles and boundaries, in [s]uch ca[s]es, I under[s]tood, were indifferent matters, mere trifles.

This dream made a deep impre[s][s]ion on my mother. I well recollect, when a boy, her [s]troking my flaxen locks, repeating her dream, and ob[s]erving with a [s]igh to my father, that [s]he was [s]ure Updike was born to be the [s]port of fortune, and that he would one day [s]uffer among savages.

I only relate facts, and leave the reader to his own comments. My own opinion of dreams I [s]hall conceal, perhaps becau[s]e I am a[s]hamed to di[s]clo[s]e it. I will venture to ob[s]erve that, if we in[s]pect the [s]acred [s]criptures, we [s]hall find frequent in[s]tances, both of direction to duty, and forewarning of future events, communicated by Providence, through the intervention of dreams. Is not the modern chri[s]tian equally the care of indulgent Heaven, as the favoured Jew, or the beloved patriarch? Many modern examples, of the foreboding vi[s]ions of the night, may be adduced. William Phipps, a poor journeyman [s]hip carpenter, dreamed that he [s]hould one day ride in his coach, and live in a grand hou[s]e near Bo[s]ton common. Many years afterwards, when he was knighted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] by King William the third, and came from England, governour of Ma[s][s]achu[s]etts Bay, this dream, even as to the [s]ituation of the grand hou[s]e, was literally and minutely fulfilled.

About my twelfth year, our mini[s]ter, who made it his cu[s]tom to in[s]pect the [s]chools annually, came to our di[s]trict. My master, who looked upon me as his be[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] scholar, directed me to read a le[s][s]on in Dilworth's [s]pelling book, which I recited as loud as I could [s]peak, without regard to empha[s]is or [s]tops. This [s]o plea[s]ed our mini[s]ter, who prided him[s]elf on the [s]trength of his own lungs, that, a [s]hort time after, coming to my father's, to dicker , as they [s]tiled it, about a [s]wop of cattle, and not finding my father [s]harp at the bargain, he changed the di[s]cour[s]e upon me; observing how delighted he was with my performances at [s]chool. What a pity it was [s]uch a genius was not encouraged. Mr. Underhill, you mu[s]t put Updike to learning. My father pleaded poverty. When I went to Harvard College, replied the mini[s]ter, I was poor indeed. I had no father with a good farm to a[s][s]i[s]t me; but, with being butler's fre[s]hman, and ringing the bell the fir[s]t year, waiter the three la[s]t, and keeping [s]chool in the vacations, I rubbed through, and am now what I am; and who knows, continued [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] he, but when Updike has completed his education, he may make a mini[s]ter, and po[s][s]ibly, when my u[s]efulne[s]s is over, supply our very pulpit. My mother here interfered. She was a little [s]pare woman. My father was a large bony man; famous, in his youth, for carrying the ring at wre[s]tling; and, in his latter years, for his pre[s]everance at town meetings. But, notwith[s]tanding my father's [s]ucce[s]s in carrying points abroad, my mother, [s]ome how or other, contrived always to carry them at home. My father never would acknowledge this; but, when a coar[s]e neighbour would [s]ometimes [s]lily hint the old adage of the gray mare being the better hor[s]e, he would [s]ay to his particular friends that he always was conqueror in his dome[s]tic warfare: but would confe[s]s that he loved quiet, and was of late tired of perpetually getting the victory. My mother joined the minister; ob[s]erving that Updike [s]hould have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] learning, though [s]he worked her hands to the bone to procure it. She did not doubt, when he came to preach, he would be as much run after as the great Mr. Whitfield. I always thought, continued [s]he, the child was a genius; and always intended he [s]hould go to college. The boy loves books. He has read Valentine and Or[s]on, and Robin[s]on Cru[s]oe. I went, the other day, three miles to borrow Pilgrim's Progre[s]s for him. He has read it through every bit; ay, and under[s]tands it too. Why, he [s]tuck a [s]kewer through Apollyon's eye in the picture, to help Chri[s]tian beat him. My father could not an[s]wer my mother's argument. The dicker about the oxen was renewed; and it was concluded to [s]wop even, though my father's were much the likelier cattle, and that I [s]hould go that week and [s]tudy Latin with the mini[s]ter, and be fitted for college. With him I [s]tudied four years, labouring ince[s][s]antly at Greek and Latin: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] as to Engli[s]h grammar, my preceptor, knowing nothing of it him[s]elf, could communicate nothing to me. As he was enthusiastically attached to the Greek, and had delivered an oration in that language, at the commencement at Cambridge, when he took his fir[s]t degree, by his direction, I committed to memory above four hundred of the mo[s]t [s]onorous lines in Homer, which I was called to repeat before a number of clergymen, who vi[s]ited him at an annual convention, in our pari[s]h. The[s]e gentlemen were ever plea[s]ed to expre[s]s a[s]toni[s]hing admiration at my literary acquirements. One of them prognosticated that I [s]hould be a general, from the fire and force, with which I recited Homer's battles of the Greeks and Trojans. Another augered that I [s]hould be a member of congre[s]s, and equal the Adam[s]es in oratory, from my repeating the speeches, at the councils of the heathen gods, with [s]uch attention to the cae[s]ura. A [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] third was [s]ure that I [s]hould become a Wither[s]poon in divinity, from the pathos, with which I declaimed Jupiter's [s]peech to all the gods. In fine, the[s]e gentlemen con[s]idered the cla[s][s]ics the [s]ource of all valuable knowledge. With them dead languages were more e[s]timable than living; and nothing more nece[s][s]ary to accompli[s]h a young man for all, that is profitable and honourable in life, than a profound knowledge of Homer. One of them gravely ob[s]erved that he was [s]ure General Wa[s]hington read Greek; and that he never would have captured the He[s][s]ians at Trenton, if he had not taken his plan of operation from that of Uly[s][s]es and Diomede [s]eizing the hor[s]es of Rhe[s]us, as de[s]cribed in the tenth book of the Iliad. Thus flattered by the learned, that I was in the high road to fame, I gulped down daily portions of Greek, while my preceptor made quarterly vi[s]its to my father's barn yard, for pay for my in[s]truction. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] In June, one thou[s]and [s]even hundred and eighty, my father began [s]eriou[s]ly to think of [s]ending me to college. He called upon a neighbour, to whom he had [s]old part of his farm, for [s]ome ca[s]h. His creditor readily paid, the whole [s]um due, down in paper money, and my father found, to his [s]urprize, that the value of three acres paid him the principal and interest of the whole [s]um, for which he had [s]old [s]eventy five acres of land, five years before. This was [s]o [s]evere a [s]troke of ill fortune, that it entirely fru[s]trated the design of [s]ending me to college. Heteroclita [s]unto. Lilly's Grammar . ARGUMENT.

My father was a[s]toni[s]hed. He was a plain unlettered man, of [s]trong natural abilities. Pray, Reverend Sir, [s]aid my father, do they not learn this Greek language at college? If [s]o, why do [s]uch wi[s]e men, as the governours of colleges, teach boys what is entirely u[s]ele[s]s? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] I thought that the [s]um of all good education was, to teach youth tho[s]e things, which they were to practi[s]e in after life. Learning, replied our enlightened vi[s]itor, has its fa[s]hions; and, like other fa[s]hions of this world, they pa[s]s away. When our forefathers founded the college, at Cambridge, critical knowledge in the mazes and [s]ubtleties of [s]chool divinity was all the mode. He that could give a new turn to an old text, or detect a mistranslation in the ver[s]ion, was more admired than the man, who invented printing, di[s]covered the magnetic powers, or contrived an in[s]trument of agriculture, which [s]hould abridge the labour of the husbandman. The books of our faith, with the voluminous commentaries of the fathers, being originally written, in what are now called, the dead languages, the knowledge of tho[s]e languages was then nece[s][s]ary, for the accompli[s]hment of the fa[s]hionable [s]cholar. The moderns, of New England, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] have cea[s]ed to intere[s]t them[s]elves in the di[s]putes, whether a civil oath may be administered to an unregenerate man; or, whether [s]ouls, exi[s]ting merely in the contemplation of Deity, are capable of actual tran[s]gre[s][s]ion. Fa[s]hion has given a new direction to the pur[s]uits of the learned. They no longer [s]oar into the regions of infinite [s]pace; but endeavour, by the aid of natural and moral philo[s]ophy, to amend the manners, and better the condition of man: and the college, at Cambridge, may be a[s][s]imilated to an old beau, with his pocket holes under his arm pits, the [s]kirts of his coat to his ancles, and three gro[s]s of buttons on his breeches; looking with contempt on the more ea[s]y, u[s]eful garb of the pre[s]ent day, for deviating from what was fa[s]hionable in his youth. But, inquired my father, is there not [s]ome valuable knowledge contained in tho[s]e Greek books? All that is u[s]eful in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] them, replied our vi[s]itor, is already translated into Engli[s]h; and more of the [s]en[s]e and [s]pirit may be imbibed, from translations, than mo[s]t [s]cholars would be able to extract, from the originals, if they even availed them[s]elves of [s]uch an acquaintance with that language, as is u[s]ually acquired, at college. Well , replied my father, do you call them dead languages. It appears to me now, that confining a lad of lively genius to the [s]tudy of them, for five or [s]ix of the mo[s]t precious years of his youth, is like the ingenious cruelty of tho[s]e tyrants, I have heard of, who chained the living and the dead together. If Updike went to college, I [s]hould wi[s]h he would learn, not bard wards , but u[s]eful things . You [s]pake of governours of colleges, continued our vi[s]itor. Let me observe, as an apology, for the concern they may be [s]uppo[s]ed to have, in this errour, that they are moral, worthy men, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] who have pa[s][s]ed the [s]ame dull routine of education, and who[s]e knowledge is necessarily confined to the[s]e defunct languages. They mu[s]t teach their pupils what they know, not what they do not know. That mea[s]ure, which was mea[s]ured unto them, they mete out, mo[s]t liberally, unto others. Should not the legi[s]lature, as the fathers of the people, interfere, inquired my father? We will not talk politics, at this time, replied our vi[s]itor. My father was now determined that I [s]hould not go to college. He concealed this conver[s]ation from me, and I was left to be proud of my Greek. The little advantage, this decea[s]ed language has [s]ince been to me, has often cau[s]ed me [s]orely to regret the mi[s]pen[s]e of time, in acquiring it. The French make it no part of their academical [s]tudies. Voltaire, D'Alembert, and Diderot, when they completed their education, were probably ignorant of the cognata tempora of a Greek verb. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] It was re[s]olved that I [s]hould labour on my father's farm; but alas! a ta[s]te for Greek had quite eradicated a love for labour. Poring [s]o inten[s]ely on Homer and Virgil had [s]o completely filled my brain with the heathen mythology, that I imagined a Hamadryade in every [s]apling, a Naiad in every puddle; and expected to hear the [s]obbings of the infant Fauns, as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek names to all our farming tools; and cheered the cattle with hexameter ver[s]e. My father's hired men, after a tedious day's labour in the woods, in[s]pecting our [s]tores, for refre[s]hment, in[s]tead of the cu[s]tomary bread and chee[s]e and brandy, found Homer's Iliad, Virgil Delphini and Schrevelius's Lexicon, in the ba[s]ket. After I had worked on the farm [s]ome months, having killed a fat heifer of my father's, upon which the family depended for their winter's beef, covered it with green boughs, and laid it in the [s]hade to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] putrify, in order to rai[s]e a [s]warm of bees, after the manner of Virgil; which proce[s]s, notwith[s]tanding I followed clo[s]ely the directions in the georgics, [s]ome how or other, failed, my father con[s]ented to my mother's reque[s]t, that I [s]hould renew my career of learning. Delightful ta[s]k! to rear the tender thought, To teach the young idea how to [s]hoot, To pour the fre[s]h in[s]truction o'er the mind, To breathe th' enliv'ning [s]pirit, and to fix The gen'rous purpo[s]e in the glowing brea[s]t.

How my heart dilated with the prospect, in the tedious interval, previous to my entering upon my [s]chool. How often have I [s]tood [s]u[s]pended over my dung fork, and anticipated my [s]cholars, [s]eated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] in awful [s]ilence around me, my arm chair and birchen [s]ceptre of authority. There was an echo in my father's [s]heep pa[s]ture. More than once have I repaired there alone, and exclaimed with a loud voice, is MASTER Updike Underhill at home? I would [s]peak with MASTER Underhill, for the plea[s]ure of hearing how my title [s]ounded. Do[s]t thou [s]mile, indignant reader, pau[s]e and recollect if the[s]e [s]en[s]ations have not been familiar to thee, at [s]ometime in thy life. If thou answerest di[s]dainfully---no---then I aver thou ha[s]t never been a corporal in the militia, or a [s]ophimore at college. At times, I however entertained le[s]s plea[s]ing, but more rational contemplations on my pro[s]pects. As I had been once unmercifully whipt, for detecting my master in a fal[s]e concord, I re[s]olved to be mild in my government, to avoid all manual correction, and doubted not by the[s]e means to [s]ecure the love and re[s]pect of my pupils. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] In the interim of [s]chool hours, and in tho[s]e peaceful intervals, when my pupils were engaged in [s]tudy, I hoped to indulge my[s]elf with my favourite Greek. I expected to be overwhelmed with the gratitude of their parents, for pouring the fre[s]h in[s]truction over the minds of their children, and teaching their young ideas how to [s]hoot. I anticipated independence from my [s]alary, which was to be equal to four dollars, hard money, per month, and my boarding; and expected to find amu[s]ement and plea[s]ure among the circles of the young, and to derive information and delight from the cla[s][s]ic converse of the mini[s]ter. In due time my ambition was gratified, and I placed at the head of a [s]chool, consisting of about [s]ixty [s]cholars. Excepting three or four overgrown boys of eighteen, the generality of them were under the age of [s]even years. Perhaps a more ragged, ill bred, ignorant [s]et, never were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] collected, for the puni[s]hment of a poor pedagogue. To [s]tudy in [s]chool was impossible. In[s]tead of the [s]ilence I anticipated, there was an ince[s][s]ant clamour. Predominant among the jarring [s]ounds were, Sir, may I read? May I [s]pell? Ma[s]ter, may I go out? Will ma[s]ter mend my pen? What with the pouting of the [s]mall children, [s]ent to [s]chool, not to learn, but to keep them out of "harm's way," and the gruff [s]urly complaints of the larger ones, I was nearly di[s]tracted. Homer's poluphlo[s]osio thala[s][s]es , roaring [s]ea, was a whi[s]per to it. My re[s]olution, to avoid beating of them, made me invent [s]mall puni[s]hments, which often have a [s]alutary impre[s][s]ion, on delicate minds; but they were in[s]en[s]ible to [s]hame. The putting of a paper fool's cap on one, and ordering another under my great chair, only excited mirth in the [s]chool; which the very delinquents them[s]elves often increa[s]ed, by loud peals of laughter. Going, one [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] frosty morning, into my [s]chool, I found one of the larger boys [s]itting by the fire in my arm chair. I gently reque[s]ted him to remove. He replied that he would, when he had warmed him[s]elf; "father finds wood, and not you." To have my throne u[s]urped, in the face of the whole [s]chool, [s]hook my government to the centre. I immediately [s]natched my two foot rule, and laid it pretty [s]martly acro[s]s his back. He quitted the chair, muttering that he would tell father. I found his threats of more con[s]equence than I apprehended. The [s]ame afternoon, a tall, rawboned man called me to the door; immediately collering me with one hand, and holding a cart whip over my head with the other; with fury in his face, he vowed he would whip the [s]kin from my bones, if ever I [s]truck Jotham again: ay, he would do it that very moment, if he was not afraid I would take the law of him. This was the only in[s]tance of the overwhelming [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] gratitude of parents I received. The next day, it was reported all over town, what a cruel man the ma[s]ter was. "Poor Jotham came into [s]chool, half frozen and near fainting; ma[s]ter had been [s]itting a whole hour by the warm fire; he only begged him to let him warm him[s]elf a little, when the ma[s]ter ro[s]e in a rage, and cut open his head with the tongs, and his life was de[s]paired of." Fatigued with the vexations of my [s]chool, I one evening repaired to the tavern, and mixed with [s]ome of the young men of the town. Their conver[s]ation I could not reli[s]h; mine they could not comprehend. The [s]ubject of race hor[s]es being introduced, I ventured to de[s]cant upon Xanthus, the immortal cour[s]er of Achilles. They had never heard of '[s]quire Achilles, or his hor[s]e; but they offered to bet two to one, that Bajazet, the Old Roan, or the deacon's mare, Pumpkin and Milk, would beat him, and challenged me to appoint time and place. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] Nor was I more acceptable among the young women. Being invited to [s]pend an evening, after a quilting, I thought this a happy opportunity to introduce Andromache, the wife of the great Hector, at her loom; and Penelope, the faithful wife of Uly[s][s]es, weaving her [s]even years web. This was received with a [s]tupid [s]tare, until I mentioned the long time the queen of Uly[s][s]es was weaving; when a [s]mart young woman ob[s]erved, that [s]he [s]uppo[s]ed Mi[s]s Penelope's yarn was rotted in whitening, that made her [s]o long: and then told a tedious [s]tory of a piece of cotton and linen [s]he had her[s]elf woven, under the [s]ame circum[s]tances. She had no [s]ooner fini[s]hed, than, to enforce my ob[s]ervations, I recited above forty lines of Greek, from the Ode[s][s]ey, and then began a di[s][s]ertation on the caesura . In the mid[s]t of my harrangue, a florid faced young man, at the further end of the room, with two large [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] prominent foreteeth, remarkably white, began to [s]ing, "Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;" And immediately the whole company ru[s]hed forward, to [s]ee who [s]hould get a chance in the reel of [s]ix. I was about retiring, fatigued and disgusted, when it was hinted to me, that I might wait on Mi[s]s Mima home; but as I could recollect no word in the Greek, which would con[s]true into bundling , or any of Homer's heroes, who got the bag , I declined. In the Latin, it is true, that  aeneas and Dido, in the cave, [s]eem [s]omething like a precedent. It was reported all over the town, the next day, that ma[s]ter was a papi[s]h , as he had talked French two hours. Di[s]appointed of recreation, among the young, my next object was the mini[s]ter. Here I expected plea[s]ure and profit. He had [s]pent many years in preaching, for the edification of private families, and was [s]ettled in the town, in a fit of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] enthusiasm; when the people drove away a clergyman, re[s]pectable for his years and learning. This he was plea[s]ed to call an awakening. He lectured me, at the on[s]et, for not attending the conference and night meetings; talked much of gifts, and decried human learning, as carnal and devili[s]h, and well he might, he certainly was under no obligations to it; for a new [s]inging ma[s]ter coming into town, the young people, by their ma[s]ter's advice, were for introducing Dr. Watts's ver[s]ion of the P[s]alms. Although I argued with the mini[s]ter an hour, he remains firmly convinced, to this day, that the ver[s]ion of Sternhold and Hopkins is the [s]ame in language, letter, and metre, with tho[s]e P[s]alms King David chaunted, in the city of Jeru[s]alem. As for the independence I had founded, on my wages, it vani[s]hed, like the re[s]t of my [s]chola[s]tic pro[s]pects. I had contracted [s]ome debts. My reque[s]t for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] present payment, was received with astonishment. I found, I was not to expect it, until the next autumn, and then not in ca[s]h, but produce; to become my own collector, and pick up my dues, half a peck of corn or rye in a place. I was almo[s]t di[s]tracted, and yearned for the expiration of my contract, when an unexpected period was put to my distress. News was brought, that, by the carele[s][s]ne[s]s of the boys, the [s]chool hou[s]e was burnt down. The common cry now was, that I ought, in ju[s]tice, to pay for it; as to my want of proper government the carele[s][s]ne[s]s of the boys ought to be imputed. The beating of Jotham, was forgotten, and a thou[s]and [s]tories of my want of proper [s]pirit circulated. The[s]e reports, and even the lo[s]s of a valuable Gradus ad Parna[s][s]um  , did not damp my joy. I am [s]ometimes led to believe, that my emancipation from real [s]lavery in Algiers, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] did not afford me [s]incerer joy, than I experienced at that moment. I returned to my father, who received me with kindne[s]s. My mother heard the [s]tory of my di[s]comfitures with transport; as, [s]he [s]aid, [s]he had no doubt that her dream, about my falling into the hands of [s]avages, was now out.

It was determined that I [s]hould pur[s]ue one of the learned profe[s][s]ions. My father, with parental pride and partiality, conceiving my aversion to labour, my inattention to farming bu[s]ine[s]s, and the tricks I had played him, the preceding [s]ea[s]on, as the [s]ure indications of genius. He now told the [s]tory of the putrified heifer, with triumph; as he had read, in the news papers, that playing with paper kites was the foundation of Doctor Franklin's fame; that John Locke, who di[s][s]ected the human mind, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] and di[s]covered the circulation of the [s]oul, had, in the full exerci[s]e of his understanding, played at duck and drake, on the Thames, with his gold watch, while he gravely returned the pebble [s]tone, which he held in his other hand, into his fob; and, that the learned Sir I[s]aac Newton made [s]oap bladders with the funk of a tobacco pipe, and was, ever after, [s]o enamoured with his [s]ooty junk, as to make u[s]e of the delicate finger of a young lady, he courted, as a pipe [s]topper. I was allowed the choice of my profession, to di[s]cover the bent of my genius. By the advice of a friend, my father put into my hands, what he was told were [s]ome of the prime books, in the feveral [s]ciences. In divinity, I read ten funeral, five election, three ordination, and [s]eventeen farewell [s]ermons, Bunyan's Holy War, the Life of Colonel Gardner, and the Religious Court[s]hip.

The account of a cure he performed, after I had been with him about a year, may not be unacceptable to the lovers of natural re[s]earch.

He was born [s]tone blind. His blindne[s]s was in [s]ome mea[s]ure compensated, by the attention of his friends; and the encrea[s]ed power of his other organs of perception. His brothers and [s]i[s]ters enriched his mind, by reading to him, in [s]ucce[s][s]ion, two hours every day, from the be[s]t authors. His [s]en[s]e of feeling was a[s]toni[s]hingly delicate, and his hearing, if po[s][s]ible, more acute. His [s]en[s]es of ta[s]te and [s]melling, were not [s]o remarkable.

He could read a book or news paper, newly printed, tolerably well, by tracing, with the tip of his finger, the indents of the types.

He was ma[s]ter of mu[s]ic, and had contrived a board, perforated with many gimblet holes; and, with the a[s][s]i[s]tance of a little bag of wooden pegs, [s]haped at top, according to his directions, he could prick almo[s]t any tune, upon its being [s]ung to him. When in a large company, who [s]at [s]ilent, he could di[s]tingui[s]h how many per[s]ons were pre[s]ent, by noting, with his ear, their different manner of breathing. By the rarity or den[s]ity of the air, not perceivable by tho[s]e in company, he could di[s]tingui[s]h high ground from low; and by the motion of the [s]ummer's breeze, too [s]mall to move the loftie[s]t leaf, he would pronounce, whether he was in a wood or open country. He was an unfeigned believer, in the salutary truths of chri[s]tianity. He had imbibed its benevolent [s]pirit. When he [s]poke of religion, his language was love to God, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] and good will to man. He was no zealot, but, when he talked of the wonders of creation, he was animated with a glow of enthu[s]ia[s]m. You ob[s]erved, the other day, as we were walking on this plain, my friend, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf to me, as I was intimate in the family, that you knew a certain per[s]on, by his gait, when at [s]o great a di[s]tance, that you could not discern his features. From this you took occasion to ob[s]erve, that you [s]aw the ma[s]ter hand of the great Creator, in the obvious difference that was between man and man: not only the gro[s][s]er difference between the Indian, the African, the E[s]quimeaux, and the white man; but that which distinguishes and defines accurately, men of the [s]ame nation, and even children of the [s]ame parents. You ob[s]erved, that as all the children of the great family of the earth, were compounded of [s]imilar members, features, and lineaments, how wonderfully it di[s]played the [s]kill of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] Almighty Arti[s]t, to model [s]uch an infinite variety of beings, and di[s]tinctly diver[s]ify them, from the [s]ame materials. You added, that the incident, you had noticed, gave fre[s]h in[s]tance of admiration; for you was now convinced that, if even all men had been formed of [s]o near re[s]emblance, as not to be di[s]cerned from each other, when at re[s]t; yet, when in motion, from their gait, air, and manner, they might readily be di[s]tingui[s]hed. While you [s]poke, I could perceive, that you pitied me, as being blind to a wonderful operation of creative power. I too, in my turn, could triumph. Blind as I am, I have di[s]covered a [s]till minuter, but as certain a di[s]tinction, between the children of men, which has e[s]caped the touch of your eyes. Bring me five men, perfect [s]trangers to me; pair the nails of the [s]ame finger, [s]o as to be even with the fingers ends, let me touch, with the tip of my finger, the nails thus prepared. Tell me each per[s]on's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] name, as he pa[s][s]es in contact before me, bring the [s]ame per[s]ons to me one month afterwards, with their nails paired, in the [s]ame manner, and I will call every one by his right name. For, be a[s][s]ured, my friend, that arti[s]t, who has denied to me that thing called light, hath opened the eyes of my mind, to know that there is not a greater difference between the African and the European, than what I could discover, between the finger nails of all the men of this world. This experiment he afterwards tried, with uniform [s]ucce[s]s. It was amu[s]ing, in a gayer hour, to hear him argue the [s]uperiority of the touch to the [s]ight. Certainly, the feeling is a nobler [s]en[s]e, than that you call [s]ight. I infer it from the care nature has taken of the former, and her di[s]regard to the latter. The eyes are comparatively poor, puny, weak organs. A [s]mall blow, a mote, or a [s]traw may reduce tho[s]e, who [s]ee with them, to a [s]ituation as pitiable as mine; while [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] feeling is diffu[s]ed over the whole body. Cut off my arm, and a [s]en[s]e of feeling remains. Completely di[s]member me, and, while I live, I po[s][s]e[s]s it. It is coexi[s]tent with life it[s]elf. The [s]en[s]es of [s]melling and ta[s]te are but modifications of this noble [s]en[s]e, distinguished, through the inaccuracy of men, by other names. The flavour of the mo[s]t delicious mor[s]el is felt by the tongue; and, when we [s]mell the aromatic, it is the effluvia of the ro[s]e, which comes in contact with the olfactory nerves. You, that enjoy [s]ight, inadvertently confe[s]s its inferiority. My brother, honing his penknife, the other day, pa[s][s]ed it over his thumb nail, to di[s]cover if the edge was [s]mooth. I heard him, and inquired, why he did not touch it with his eyes, as he did other objects. He confe[s][s]ed that he could not di[s]cover the gaps, by the [s]ight. Here, the [s]uperiority of the mo[s]t inaccurate [s]eat of the feeling, was manife[s]t. To conclude, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] he would archly add: in marriage, the mo[s]t important concern in life, how many mi[s]erable, of both [s]exes, are left to deplore, in tears, their dependence on this treacherous thing, called [s]ight. From this danger, I am happily [s]ecured, continued he, [s]miling and pre[s][s]ing the hand of his cousin, who [s]at be[s]ide him; a beautiful blooming young woman, of eighteen, who had been bred with him, from childhood, and who[s]e affection for him, was [s]uch that [s]he was willing, notwith[s]tanding his blindne[s]s, to take him as a partner for life. They expected [s]hortly to be married. Notwith[s]tanding his accuracy and veracity upon [s]ubjects, he could comprehend; there were many, on which he was miserably confu[s]ed. He called [s]ight the touch of the eyes. He had no adequate idea of colours. White, he [s]uppo[s]ed, was like the feeling of down; and [s]carlet he re[s]embled to the [s]ound of martial mu[s]ic. By pa[s][s]ing his hands over the porcelain, earthern, or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] plai[s]ter of Paris images, he could readily conceive of their being repre[s]entations of men or animals. But he could have no idea of pictures. I pre[s]ented him a large picture of his grand father, painted with oil colours on canva[s]s; told him who[s]e re[s]emblance it was. He pa[s][s]ed his hand over the [s]mooth [s]urface and mu[s]ed. He repeated this; exclaimed it was wonderful; looked melancholy; but never a[s]ked for the picture again. Upon this young man, my preceptor operated [s]ucce[s]sfully. I was pre[s]ent during the whole proce[s]s, though few were admitted. Upon the introduction of the couching in[s]truments, and the removal of the film from the retina, he appeared confu[s]ed. When the operation was completed, and he was permitted to look around him, he was violently agitated. The irritability of the ophthalmic mu[s]cles faintly, expre[s][s]ed the perturbation of his mind. After two and twenty years of total [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] darkness, to be thus awakened to a new world of [s]en[s]ation and light; to have [s]uch a flood of day poured on his benighted eye ball, overwhelmed him. The infant [s]ight was too weak, for the [s]hock, and he fainted. The doctor immediately intercepted the light with the proper bandages, and, by the application of volatiles, he was revived. The next day, the dre[s][s]ings were removed. He had fortified his mind, and was more calm. At fir[s]t, he appeared to have lo[s]t more than he had gained, by being re[s]tored to vi[s]ion. When blind, he could walk tolerably well, in places familiar to him. From [s]ight, he collected no ideas of di[s]tance. Green was a colour peculiarly agreeable to the new born [s]ight. Being led to the window, he was charmed with a tree in full verdure, and extended his arms to touch it, though at ten rods distance. To di[s]tingui[s]h objects within reach, he would clo[s]e his eyes, feel of them with his hands, and then look earne[s]tly upon them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] According to a preconcerted plan, the third day, his bandages were removed, in the pre[s]ence of his parents, brothers, [s]i[s]ters, friends, and of the amiable, lovely girl, to whom he was [s]hortly to be married. By his reque[s]t, a profound [s]ilence was to be ob[s]erved, while he endeavoured to di[s]cover the per[s]on of her, who was the object of his deare[s]t affection. It was an intere[s]ting [s]cene. The company obeyed his injunction. Not a finger moved, or a breath a[s]pirated. The bandage was then removed; and, when he had recovered from the confu[s]ion of the in[s]tant effu[s]ion of light, he pa[s][s]ed his eye hastily over the whole group. His sensations were novel and intere[s]ting. It was a moment of importance. For aught he knew, he might find the bo[s]om partner of his future life, the twin [s]oul of his affection, in the fat [s]cullion wench, of his father's kitchen; or in the per[s]on of the toothle[s]s, pal[s]ied, decriped [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] nur[s]e, who held the ba[s]on of gruel at his elbow. In pa[s][s]ing his eye a [s]econd time over the circle, his attention was arre[s]ted, by his beloved cou[s]in. The agitations of her lovely features, and the evane[s]cent blu[s]h on her cheek, would have at once betrayed her, to a more experienced eye. He passed his eye to the next per[s]on, and immediately returned it to her. It was a moment big with expectation. Many a finger was rai[s]ed to the lips of the [s]pectators, and many a look, expre[s][s]ive of the [s]ilence [s]he [s]hould pre[s]erve, was ca[s]t towards her. But the conflict was too violent for her delicate frame. He looked more intensely; [s]he bur[s]t into tears, and [s]poke. At the well known voice he clo[s]ed his eyes, ru[s]hed towards her, and cla[s]ped her in his arms. I envied them their feelings; but I thought then, and do now, that the [s]en[s]ations of my preceptor, the [s]kilful humane operator, were more enviable. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] man who could re[s]tore life and u[s]efulne[s]s, to the darling of his friends, and [s]catter light in the paths of an amiable young pair, mu[s]t have known a joy never surpassed; except, with reverence be it [s]poken, by the [s]atisfaction of our benevolent Saviour, when, by his miraculous power, he opened the eyes of the actually blind, made the dumb to [s]ing, and the lame and impotent leap for joy.

A highly poli[s]hed plane of [s]teel was pre[s]ented to him, with a [s]troke of an etching tool, [s]o minutely engraved upon it, that it was invi[s]ible to the naked eye, and only di[s]coverable with a powerful magnifying gla[s]s; with his fingers he discovered the extent, and mea[s]ured the length of the line. This gentleman lo[s]t his [s]ight, at three years of age. He informed me, that being overturned, in a [s]tage coach, one dark rainy evening, in England, when the carriage, and four hor[s]es, were thrown into a ditch, the pa[s][s]engers and driver, with two eyes a piece, were obliged to apply to him, who had none, for a[s][s]i[s]tance, in extricating the hor[s]es.

Of my acquirements, in that language, I was [s]till proud. I attributed the indifference, with which it was received in the town, where I had kept [s]chool, to the ru[s]ticity [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] and ignorance of the people. As I now moved in the circles of poli[s]hed life, I ventured, [s]ometimes, when the young ladies had [s]uch mon[s]trous colds, as that they could not, by the earne[s]t persuasions of the company, be prevailed on to [s]ing; when it had been frequently observed, that it was quaker meeting, to [s]pout a few lines from the Iliad. It is true, they did not interrupt me with, "Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;" But the mo[s]t [s]onorous lines of the divine blind bard were received with cold approbation of politene[s]s. One young lady, alone, [s]eemed plea[s]ed. She would frequently a[s]k me, to repeat tho[s]e lines of Waba[s]h poetry. Though once, in the [s]ublime pa[s][s]age of the hero Uly[s][s]es, hanging fifty young maidens, with his own hands, in the Ody[s][s]ey, I heard the term, pedant, pronounced with peculiar empha[s]is, by a beau, at my back. If I had taken the hint, and pa[s][s]ed my Greek [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] upon my companions, for Indian, they would have heard me with rapture. I have [s]ince known that worthy, indefatigable mi[s][s]ionary to the Indians, the Reverend Mr. K---, the modern Elliot, entertain the [s]ame companies, for whole evenings, with [s]peeches in the aboriginal of America, as unintelligible to them, as my in[s]ulted Greek. I was [s]o plea[s]ed with the young lady, who approved the Greek heroics, that I determined to make my fir[s]t e[s][s]ay, in metre, in an ode, addre[s][s]ed to her, by name. I accordingly mu[s]tered all the high sounding epithets of the immortal Grecian bard, and [s]cattered them with profu[s]ion, through my ode. I prai[s]ed her golden locks, and a[s][s]imilated her to the ox eyed Juno; [s]ent her a correct copy, and di[s]per[s]ed a number of others, among her friends. I afterwards found, that what I intended as the [s]ublime[s]t panegyric, was received as cutting in[s]ult.

Upon being informed that I was the per[s]on, with two of the mo[s]t profound bows, I had ever [s]een, he advanced [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] towards me, and with [s]low and [s]olemn emphasis, [s]aid, then [s]ir, I have the honour to pre[s]ent you with a billet, from my friend, Mr. Ja[s]per T---. Two more bows, as [s]tately and low as the former. I took the letter, which was as big as a governmental packet; and, in the mid[s]t of a large folio [s]heet, read the following letter, from Mr. Ja[s]per T---, a profe[s][s]ed admirer of the young lady, to whom I had addressed my ode, after the manner of the Greeks. Dear Sir , Them there very extraordinary pare of var[s]es, you did your[s]elf the onner to addre[s]s to a young lada of my partecling acquaintance calls loudly for explination. I [s]hall be happy to do my[s]elf the onner of wa[s]ting a few charges of powder with you on the morro morning preci[s]ely at one half hour before [s]un ro[s]e at the lower end of --- wharff.

I am with grate par[s]onal esteem your [s]incere friend, ardent admirer well wi[s]her and umble [s]ervant to command, JASPER T---. Plea[s]e to be punctual to the hour seconds if you incline. July 24 th , 1782. Thur[s]day A. M. ante merry dying  . Though I was engaged to watch that night, with one of my preceptor's customers; yet, as Mr. Ja[s]per T---, [s]eemed [s]o friendly and civil, I could not find it in my heart, to refu[s]e him, and replied that I would, with plea[s]ure, wait upon the gentleman. Sir, re[s]umed the bearer, you are a man of honour, every inch of you, and I am your mo[s]t obedient, mo[s]t ob[s]equious, and mo[s]t humble [s]ervant: and then, making two profound bows, in the [s]hop, and one more at the door, he retired. He was no [s]ooner departed, than I [s]at down, to reperu[s]e this elegant and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] very extraordinary billet. I had no particular acquaintance with Mr. Ja[s]per T---, and why he [s]hould write to me, at all, puzzled me. The fir[s]t part of the letter, I doubted not, contained an approbation of my ode, and a reque[s]t to be indulged with an explanation of [s]ome of its peculiar beauties. I began to recollect illu[s]trations and parodies, from [s]ome favourite pa[s][s]ages in the Iliad. But, what we were to do, in wa[s]ting a few charges of powder, was utterly inexplicable. At one time, indeed, I thought it an invitation to [s]hoot partridges, and bethought my[s]elf of [s]couring a long barrelled gun, which had de[s]cended as an heir loom in our family; and had, perhaps, killed Indians, on Long I[s]land, in the hands of my brave ance[s]tor, Captain John Underhill. Then again, I reflected, that the lower end of a wharf, in a populous town, was not the mo[s]t probable place, to [s]pring a covey of partridges. But what puzzled me mo[s]t, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] was his punctual attention to hours, and even [s]econds. My doubts were all cleared, by the entrance of a fellow [s]tudent, to whom I communicated the letter. He was born in Carolina, and under[s]tood the whole bu[s]ine[s]s. It is a challenge, [s]aid he. A challenge! exclaimed I. For what? Why only, repeated he cooly, to fight a duel, with Mr. Ja[s]per T---, with [s]word and pi[s]tol. Pho! replied I, you banter. Do look at the conclu[s]ion of the letter. Will you make me believe that any man, in his [s]en[s]es, would conclude, with all the[s]e expre[s][s]ions of e[s]teem and friend[s]hip, an invitation to give him an opportunity of cutting my throat, or blowing my brains out? You have been bred in yankee land, replied my fellow [s]tudent. Men of honour are above the common rules of propriety and common [s]en[s]e. This letter, which is a challenge, bating [s]ome little inaccuracies of grammar and [s]pelling, in [s]ub[s]tance, I a[s][s]ure you, would not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] disgrace a man of the highe[s]t honour; and, if Mr. Ja[s]per T--- acts as much the man of honour, on the wharf, as he has on paper, he will pre[s]erve the [s]ame [s]tile of good breeding and politene[s]s there also. While, with one hand, he, with a deadly longe, pa[s][s]es his [s]word through your lungs, he will take his hat off, with the other, and bow gracefully to your corps. Lord deliver me from [s]uch politeness, exclaimed I. It [s]eems to me, by your account of things, that the principal difference between a man of honour, and a vulgar murderer, is that the latter will kill you in a rage, while the former will write you complai[s]ant letters, and [s]mile in your face, and bow gracefully, while he cuts your throat. Honour, or no honour, I am plaguy [s]orry I accepted his invitation. Come, continued my fellow [s]tudent, you con[s]ider this little affair too [s]eriou[s]ly. I mu[s]t indoctrinate you. There is no more danger, in the[s]e town [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] duels, than in pounding our great mortar. Why, I fought three duels my[s]elf in Carolina, before I was [s]eventeen years old; and one was for an affront offered to the negro wench, who [s]uckled me: and I declare I had rather fight ten more, than pa[s]s once, in a [s]tage waggon, over Hor[s]e Neck. I [s]ee your antagoni[s]t has offered you to bring a [s]econd. I will go with you.

You will then turn a copper for the fir[s]t-fire; but I [s]hould advi[s]e you to grant it to him. This will give him a va[s]t idea of your firmne[s]s, and contempt of danger. Your antagoni[s]t, with banishment from his country, and the gallows [s]taring him in the face, will be [s]ure not to hit you, on his own account. The ball will pa[s]s, at lea[s]t, ten rods over your head.

We [s]econds [s]hall immediately interfere, and pronounce you both men of honour. The matter in controver[s]y will be pa[s][s]ed over.

I cannot think, [s]aid I, why Mr. Ja[s]per T---, [s]hould have [s]uch bloody de[s]igns again[s]t me. I never intended to affront the young lady. Li[s]p not a word of that, replied my instructer, as you value your reputation on 'change. When he has fired over your head, you may confe[s]s what you plea[s]e, with honour; but however inoffen[s]ive you may have been, if you make [s]uch a confe[s][s]ion before, you are a man of no honour.

Notwith[s]tanding the comfortable addre[s]s of my friend, the thoughts of a premature death, or being crippled for life, di[s]tre[s][s]ed me. Nor was the fear of killing my antagoni[s]t, and of what my poor parents would [s]uffer, from my being expo[s]ed to infamous punishment, le[s]s alarming. I pa[s][s]ed [s]ome hours of dreadful anxiety; when I was relieved from my di[s]tre[s]s, in a way I little apprehended. My challenger, who had lived [s]ome years in town, as a merchant's clerk, viewing me as a raw lad, from the country, that would never dare accept his challenge, when this me[s][s]enger returned, was petrified with a[s]toni[s]hment. When a[s][s]ured that I had accepted his challenge, as a man of courage and honour, his heart died within him. His friend had no [s]ooner gone to prepare the pi[s]tols, than by communicating the bu[s]ine[s]s, as a great [s]ecret, to two or three female friends, the intended duel was noi[s]ed about town.

Warrants were i[s][s]ued, and con[s]tables di[s]patched into all quarters. I was apprehended, in the [s]ick man's chamber, where I was watching, by the high [s]heriff, two deputies, three con[s]tables, and eleven [s]tout a[s][s]i[s]tants; carried, in the dead of the night, before the magi[s]trates, where I met my antagoni[s]t, guarded by a platoon of the militia, with a colonel at their head. We were directed to [s]hake hands, make friends, and pronounce, on our honours, that we would drop an affair, which we had, neither of us, any heart to pur[s]ue. My acceptance of the challenge, however unintentional, e[s]tabli[s]hed my reputation, among the bucks and belles. The former pronounced me a man of [s]punk and [s]pirit; and the latter were proud of my arm in an evening rural walk on the paved [s]treet. None dared to call me pedant; and, I verily believe that, if I had [s]pouted a whole Iliad, in the ball [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] room, no one would have ventured to interrupt me: for I had proved my[s]elf a MAN OF HONOUR.

Though, by avoiding married parties, mingling with very young company, dressing airily; [s]hivering in lawn and sarcenet, at meeting, in December; affecting a girli[s]h li[s]p, blu[s]h, and giggle, [s]he was [s]till endeavouring to ward off that invidious appellation of old maid. Upon good grounds, I am led to believe, that the charity of the tea table had added to her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] years; becau[s]e, from a long acquaintance with her, I could never induce her to remember any event, however trivial, which happened before Lexington battle. The girls, of my age, re[s]pected me, as a man of [s]pirit; but I was more fond of being esteemed, as a man of learning. This young lady loved literature, and lamented to me her ignorance of the Greek. I gave her a decided preference to her rivals. She borrowed books of me, and read them with a[s]toni[s]hing rapidity. From my own little library, and from tho[s]e of my friends, I procured above [s]ixty volumes for her; among which were Locke on Human Under[s]tanding, Stackhou[s]e's Body of Divinity, and Gla[s]s's works, not on cookery, but the benignant works of John Gla[s]s, the father of Sandiman, and the Sandimanians; in which collection I did not however omit Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Virgil: and, to my astonishment, though I knew that her afternoons [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] were devoted to the [s]tructure of caps and bonnets, [s]he peru[s]ed tho[s]e [s]ixty volumes completely, and returned them to me, in le[s]s than a month. There was one thing peculiarly plea[s]ing to me, as a man of letters; that [s]he never made dog leaves, or [s]oiled the books; a [s]lovenly practice, of which even great [s]cholars are [s]ome times guilty. I would, at times, endeavour to draw her into a conver[s]ation, upon the author [s]he had recently peru[s]ed. She would blu[s]h, look down, and [s]ay that it did not become a young girl, like her, to talk upon [s]uch [s]ubjects, with a gentleman of my [s]en[s]e. The compliment it contained ever rendered the apology irre[s]i[s]table. One day, [s]he a[s]ked me to lend her a dictionary. I immediately procured for her the great Doctor John[s]on's, in two volumes folio. About three days afterwards, [s]he offered to return them. Knowing that a dictionary was a work, to which reference was often nece[s][s]ary; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] and, thinking it might be of [s]ome [s]ervice to evenalady of her learning, I pre[s][s]ed her to keep it longer. When [s]he replied, with the prettie[s]t li[s]p imaginable, that they were indeed very pretty [s]tory books; but, [s]ince I had lent them to her, [s]he had read them all through twice; and then inquired, with the [s]ame gentle li[s]p, if I could not lend her a book, called Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in absolute a[s]toni[s]hment. Virgil's traveller, treading on the [s]nake in the gra[s]s, was comparatively in perfect compo[s]ure. I took a folio under each arm, and [s]kipped out of the hou[s]e, as lightly as if I had had nothing heavier, than a late antifederal election [s]ermon to carry. This learned young lady was amazingly affronted, at my abrupt departure; but, when the cau[s]e of it was explained to her, [s]ome months after, [s]he endeavoured to persuade a journey man tailor, who courted her niece, to challenge me to fight a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] duel, who actually penned a challenge, upon one of his ma[s]ter's pa[s]teboard patterns; and, I verily believe, would have [s]ent it, by his [s]econd, if he had not been informed, that my character was established, as a man of honour.

Cullen, Munroe, Boerhaave, and Hunter, were my constant companions. As I progre[s][s]ed in valuable [s]cience, my admiration of the Greek declined. I now found, that Machaon and Podalirious, the [s]urgeons of Homer, were mere quacks; ignorant of even the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] application of plai[s]ters, or the eighteen tailed bandage: and, in botany, inferiour to the Indian Powwows; and that the green ointment, of my learned friend, Doctor Kitteridge, would have immortalized a bone [s]etter, in the Grecian era, and translated him, with E[s]culapius, to a [s]eat among the gods. In ju[s]tice to that venerable language, and to the learned professors of Cambridge, Yale, and Dartmouth, I will candidly confe[s]s, that my knowledge of it, was now, in the fir[s]t year of my apprentice[s]hip, of [s]ome [s]ervice to me, in now and then finding the root of the labels cyphered on our gallipots. I [s]hall mention a little incident, which happened about this time, as it contains a le[s][s]on, valuable to the reader, if he has penetration enough to di[s]cover it, and candour enough to apply it to him[s]elf. Though I applied my[s]elf clo[s]ely to my books; yet, as hours of relaxation were recommended, by my preceptor, I [s]ometimes indulged [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] in the dance, and in [s]leighing rides. The latter being propo[s]ed, at a time when I was without the means of paying my club, I had retired, with di[s]content, to my chamber; where I accidentally ca[s]t my eyes upon a little old fa[s]hioned duodecimo bible, with [s]ilver cla[s]ps, in the corner of my trunk, a pre[s]ent from my mother, at parting; who had recommended the frequent peru[s]al of it, as my guide in difficulty, and con[s]olation in di[s]tre[s]s. Young people, in perplexity, always think of home. The bible reproached me. To remove the unea[s]y [s]en[s]ation, and for the want of [s]omething more agreeable to do, I took up the neglected book. No [s]ooner had I uncla[s]ped it, than a guinea dropt from the leaves, which had been deposited there, by the generous care of my affectionate mother; and, by my inexcusable inattention, had lain there undiscovered, for more than two years. I ha[s]tily [s]natched the brilliant prize, joined my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] young companions, and re[s]olved that, in gratitude, I would read a chapter in the bible, every remaining day of my life. This re[s]olution I then per[s]evered in, a whole fortnight. As I am on this [s]ubject, I will ob[s]erve, though no zealot, I have [s]ince, in the hours of mi[s]ery and poverty, with which the reader [s]hall be acquainted, in the [s]equel, drawn trea[s]ures of [s]upport and con[s]olation, from that ble[s]t book, more precious than the gems of Golconda, or the gold of Ophir.

He po[s][s]e[s][s]ed all the e[s][s]ence, without the parade of learning. In the mo[s]t [s]imple language, he would trace the latent di[s]ea[s]e, to its diagnostic; and, from his lips, [s]ubjects the mo[s]t ab[s]tru[s]e, were rendered familiar to the unlettered man. Excepting when he was with his pupils, or men of science, I never heard him u[s]e a technical term. He ob[s]erved once, that the bold truths of Paracel[s]us delighted him; but, it partook [s]o much of the [s]peech of our country practitioners, that he was di[s]gu[s]ted with the pompo[s]ity of Theophra[s]tus Bomba[s]tus. He was both an in[s]tructor and parent to his pupils.

I carried letters of introduction, from my preceptor, to the late Dr. Jo[s]eph Gardner, and other gentlemen of the faculty. The wit and wine of this worthy man [s]till reli[s]h on recollection.

Here, to my [s]urpri[s]e, I found the curio[s]ities of all countries, but our own. When I inquired for the natural curio[s]ities of New England, with [s]pecimens of the rude arts, arms, and antiquities of the original po[s][s]e[s][s]ors of our [s]oil, I was [s]hewn, for the former, an overgrown gourd [s]hell, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] which held, I do not recollect how many gallons; [s]ome of the [s]havings of the cannon, ca[s]t under the in[s]pection of Colonel M---; a [s]tuffed wild duck, and the curious fungus of a turnip: and, for the latter, a miniature birch canoe, containing two or three rag aboriginals with paddles, cut from a [s]hingle. This la[s]t article, I confe[s]s, would not di[s]grace the baby hou[s]e of a child, if he was not above [s]even years of age.

My father had reared, for me, a likely pie bald mare. Our [s]addler equipped me with hor[s]e furniture, not forgetting the little [s]addle bags, which I richly repleni[s]hed with drugs, purcha[s]ed at Bo[s]ton. With a few books, and my surgeon's in[s]truments, in my portmanteau, and a few dollars in my pocket, I [s]at out, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] with a light heart, to [s]eek practice, fame, and fortune, as a country practitioner. My primary object was to obtain a place of [s]ettlement. This I imagined an ea[s]y ta[s]k, from my own acquirements, and the celebrity of my preceptor. My fir[s]t [s]top was at a new town[s]hip, though tolerably well [s]tocked with a hardy laborious [s]et of inhabitants. Five physicians of eminence had, within a few years, attempted a [s]ettlement in this place. The fir[s]t fell a [s]acrifice to [s]trong liquor; the [s]econd put his tru[s]t in hor[s]es, and was ruined, by the lo[s]s of a valuable fire; the third quarrelled with the midwife, and was obliged to remove; the fourth having pre[s]cribed, rather unluckily, for a young woman of his acquaintance, grievously afflicted with a tympany, went to the Ohio; and the la[s]t, being a prudent man, who [s]old his books and in[s]truments for wild land, and rai[s]ed his own crop of medicine, was actually in the way of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] making a great fortune; as, in only ten years practice, he left, at his decea[s]e, an e[s]tate, both real and per[s]onal, which was apprai[s]ed at one hundred pounds, lawful money. This account was not likely to engage the attention of a young man, upon who[s]e education twice the [s]um had been expended. In the next town, I was a[s][s]ured I might do well, as a phy[s]ician, if I would keep a grog [s]hop, or let my[s]elf, as a labourer, in the hay [s]ea[s]on, and keep a [s]chool in the winter. The fir[s]t part of the proposition, I heard with patience; but, at the bare mention of a [s]chool, I fled the town abruptly. In the neighbouring town, they did not want a phy[s]ician, as an experienced itinerant doctor vi[s]ited the place, every March, when the people had mo[s]t lei[s]ure to be [s]ick and take phy[s]ic. He practi[s]ed with great [s]ucce[s]s, e[s]pecially in [s]low con[s]umptions, charged very low, and took his pay in any thing and every [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] thing.

It was however four months before I had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] any practice, except the extracting of a tooth, from a corn fed girl, who [s]pun at my lodgings, who u[s]ed to look wi[s]tfully at me, and a[s]k, if the doctorer did not think the tooth ache a [s]ign of love? and [s]ay [s]he felt dreadfully all over; and the application of a young virgin, in the neighbourhood, who wi[s]hed to be favoured with a private lecture upon the virtues of the [s]avin bu[s]h. I verily believe I might have remained there to this day unemployed, if my landlord, a tavern keeper, finding my payment for board rather tardy, had not, by [s]ometimes sending his boy, in a violent ha[s]te, to call me out of meeting, and always vowing I was cute at the trade, at length drawn the attention of the people towards me. I had now [s]ome opportunity of increasing my information, by in[s]pecting the practice of my [s]eniors. The principal phy[s]ician had been regularly educated. As I had been likewi[s]e, he affected to pay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] me [s]ome attention, on purpo[s]e to mortify tho[s]e three quacks, who, he [s]aid, had picked up their knowledge, as they did their medicine, by the way [s]ide. He was a very formal man, in manners and practice. He viewed fre[s]h air highly noxious, in all di[s]ea[s]es. I once vi[s]ited a patient of his, in dog days, who[s]e parched tongue and acrid [s]kin denoted a violent fever. I was almo[s]t [s]uffocated, upon entering the room. The windows were clo[s]ed, and the cracks [s]tuffed with tow; the curtains were drawn clo[s]e round the patient's bed, which was covered with a rug, and three comfortable blankets; a large fire was made in the room; the door li[s]ted, and the key hole [s]topped; while the Doctor gravely admini[s]tered irritating stimulants to allay the fever. He carried a favourite practical author, in his bags, and after finding the patient's ca[s]e, in the index, pulled out a pair of money [s]cales, and, with the utmo[s]t nicety, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] weighed off the pre[s]cribed do[s]e, to the decimal of a drachm. He told me, as a great [s]ecret, that about thirteen years and one day pa[s]t, he had nearly de[s]troyed a patient, by admini[s]tering half a drachm of pill cochia more than was pre[s]cribed in the books. He was called the learned doctor. The practice of the [s]econd town physician was directly oppo[s]ite. He prescribed large do[s]es of the mo[s]t powerful drugs. If he had been inclined to weigh his medicine, I believe it would have been with gro[s]s weight, rather than troy. He was an untaught de[s]ciple of the English Ratcliffe, carele[s]s, daring, and often [s]ucce[s]sful. He was admirable in nervous ca[s]es, ro[s]e cancers, and white swellings. Upon the fir[s]t [s]ymptoms of the[s]e [s]tubborn di[s]orders, he would drive them, and the [s]ubjects of them, to a [s]tate of quiescence. He was called the cheap doctor; becau[s]e he always [s]peedily cured or--- killed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] The third phy[s]ician dealt altogether in [s]imples. The only compound he ever gave, or took, was buttered flip, for a cough. It was [s]aid, that, if he did no good, he never did any harm. He was called the [s]afe doctor. The fourth phy[s]ician was not celebrated for being learned, [s]afe, or cheap; but he had more practice than all the other three together, for he was a mu[s]ical [2] man, and well gifted in prayer.

He derived it from his birth; for he was the [s]eventh [s]on of a [s]eventh [s]on, and his mother was a doctre[s]s. He did not indeed bear the name or rank, but I remember him with the learned; as he was [s]ometimes called to vi[s]it a patient, at that critical, intere[s]ting period, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] when the other phy[s]icians had given him over; but his ordinary practice lay wholly among [s]heep, hor[s]es, and cattle. He al[s]o could boa[s]t of a[s]toni[s]hing [s]ucce[s]s, and was as proud and opinionated as the be[s]t of them; and, for aught I know, it was as in[s]tructive to hear him talk of his ringtones, wind galls, and [s]pavins, as to hear our fir[s]t phy[s]ician de[s]eant upon his paroxy[s]ms and peripneumony. Being [s]ent for, one day, to attend a man who[s]e leg was [s]aid to be broken, by a fall from a frame at a rai[s]ing, I found, upon my arrival at the patient's, that a brother of the faculty, from the vicinity, had arrived before me, and completed the operation. He was celebrated for his [s]kill in de[s]perateca[s]es; and univer[s]ally allowed to be a man of learning. He had pre[s]cribed a gill of burnt brandy, with a pepper pod in it, to keep up the patient's [s]pirits, under the operation, and took another himself, to keep his hand [s]teady. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] splintered the fractured limb, with the bone of two pair of old fa[s]hioned [s]tays, he had cau[s]ed to be ript to pieces and bound round the leg, with all the garters in the neighbourhood. He bowed gracefully, as I entered, and regretted extremely that he had not my a[s][s]i[s]tance in [s]etting the bones; and with a loud voice, and the mo[s]t unparalleled a[s][s]urance, began to lay the ca[s]e before me, and amplify the operation he had performed. Sir, [s]aid he, when I came to view the patient, I had little hopes of [s]aving his life. I found the two le[s][s]er bones of the leg, the mu[s]a and the tri[s]tis [s]hivered into a thou[s]and [s]plinters. While the larger bone, the ambobus, had happily e[s]caped unhurt. Perceiving I could [s]carce refrain from laughing, and was about to [s]peak; [s]ir, [s]aid he, winking upon me, I perceive you are one of us men of [s]cience, and I wi[s]h you to [s]u[s]pend your opinion, until a private con[s]ultation; le[s]t our conver[s]ation may alarm the patient [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] too much, for you know, as the learned Galen ob[s]erves, Omne quod exit in Hum ,  Gr aecum, five Latinum E[s][s]e genus neutrum, [s]ic invariabile nomen. By the way, nurse,the[s]e learned languages are apt to make the profe[s][s]ors of them very thir[s]ty. While the toddy was making, he proceeded. When I pondered this perilous, piteous, pertinacious, pe[s]tiferous, petrifying ca[s]e, I immediately thought of the directions of the learned doctors Hudibras and Mc'Fingal, not forgetting, as the wound was on the leg, the great Crook[s]hank's church hi[s]tory. When we had drunk our liquor, of which he took four fifths, by his direction a new mug was made a little [s]tronger, and we retired to our con[s]ultation. I am much obliged to you, [s]aid he, for not di[s]covering my ignorance, to the[s]e people; though, it is ten to one, if I had not rather convinced the blockheads of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] yours, if you had attempted it. A regular bred phy[s]ician, [s]ometime [s]ince, attempted this. He declared, over the [s]ick man's bed, that I was ignorant, and presuming. I replied that he was a quack; and offered to leave our preten[s]ions to knowledge, to the company, which con[s]i[s]ted of a midwife, two experienced nur[s]es, and [s]ome others, not [s]o eminent for learning. He quoted Cullen and Che[s][s]elden; and I Tully and Virgil. Until at length, when I had nearly exhau[s]ted my [s]tock of cant phra[s]es, and he was gaining the attention of our judges, I luckily bethought me of Lilly's Grammar. I began Propria quae maribus; and before I had got twenty lines, the opinion of the audience was apparently in my favour. They judged naturally enough, that I was the mo[s]t learned man, becau[s]e the mo[s]t unintelligible. This rai[s]ed the doctor's ire [s]o much that from di[s]puting me, he began to berate them for a parcel of fools, [s]ots, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] old women, to put their lives in the hands of [s]uch an ignoramus as me. This quickly decided the conte[s]t in my favour. The old nur[s]es rai[s]ed their voices, the midwife her broom [s]tick, and the whole train of mob caped judges, their [s]kinny fi[s]ts, and we drove him out of the hou[s]e in triumph. Our victory was [s]o complete, that, in the military [s]tile, we did not allow him to remain on the field to bury his dead. But it is time to tell you who I am. Sir, I drink your health. In brief, [s]ir, I am the [s]on of a re[s]pectable clergyman, received a college education, entered into merchandize, failed, and, by a train of misfortunes, was obliged to commence doctor, for [s]u[s]tenance. I [s]ettled my[s]elf in this back country. At fir[s]t I was applied to chiefly, in de[s]perate ca[s]es; where no reputation is lo[s]t, if the patient dies, and much gained, if he recovers. I have performed [s]ome [s]urpri[s]ing cures; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] how I cannot tell you, except it was by allowing my patients [s]mall beer, or any thing el[s]e they hankered after, which I have heard was [s]ometimes efficacious, in the cri[s]is of a fever. But talking of drink, [s]ir, I wi[s]h your health. I believe I have never injured any per[s]ons, by my prescriptions. As powdered, burnt cru[s]t, chalk, and juice of beets and carrots are my mo[s]t powerful medicines. We can be of mutual [s]ervice to each other; nur[s]e, another mug. We doctors find this a very difficult ca[s]e. As I have borne down the[s]e country quacks, by [s]uperiour effrontery, I can recommend you to full practice. I will call you to con[s]ult with me, in difficult ca[s]es; for, as I was [s]aying, [s]ir, I wi[s]h your good health, mine are all difficult ca[s]es; and you, in return, [s]hall lend me books, and give me [s]uch instructions as will enable me to do good, as well as get [s]ame and bread. The propo[s]al was rea[s]onable. I clo[s]ed with it. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] emptied the third mug, and we returned to our patient. When the dre[s][s]ings were removed, I di[s]covered that there was not the [s]lighte[s]t fracture of the fibula or tibia; but only a [s]light contu[s]ion on the patula, which would perhaps not have alarmed any other per[s]on, but our patient, who was a rich old bachelor. I recommended an emollient, which my learned brother acquie[s]ced in, [s]aying, with his usual air, that it was the very application he intended, having applied the garters and whalebone, merely to concoct the tri[s]tis, the mu[s]a and the ambobus firmly together. A young girl, at the door, [s]hewed him a wound on her elbow, which [s]he had received in [s]truggling about red ears at a hu[s]king; which he gravely pronounced to be a fi[s]tula in ano. This gentleman is really a man of abilities; has [s]ince made valuable acquirements in the knowledge of the human machine, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] materia medica. If he could be led to substitute the aquatic draughts of Doctor Sangrado, as a [s]uccedaneum for the diffusible [s]timuli of Brown, he would become u[s]eful in the faculty, and yet [s]ee happy days. The doctor kept his word. He read my books, received my in[s]tructions, and recommended me to his patients. But, as I copied my preceptor, in the simplicity of my language I never attempted to excite the fear of my patients, to magnify my [s]kill; and could not reduce three fractured bones in a limb, which contained but two. My advice was little attended to, except when backed with that of my pupil, accompanied with frequent quotations from Lilly. He obtained all the credit of our [s]ucce[s]s; and the people generally [s]uppo[s]ed me a young man of moderate talents, whom the learned doctor might make [s]omething of, in a cour[s]e of years.

A drunken jockey, having fallen from his hor[s]e, at a public review, was taken up [s]en[s]ele[s]s, and extended upon the long table of the tavern. He [s]oon recovered his breath, and groaned mo[s]t piteou[s]ly. As his head [s]truck the ground fir[s]t, it was apprehended by [s]ome, unacquainted with its [s]olidity, that he had fractured his [s]kull. The faculty ha[s]tened, from all quarters, to his a[s][s]i[s]tance. The learned, scrupulous phy[s]ician, after reque[s]ting that the doors and windows might be [s]hut, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] approached the patient; and, with a [s]tately air, declined giving his opinion, as he had unfortunately left at home his Pringle on contu[s]ions. The cheap doctor immediately pronounced the wound a compound fracture, pre[s]cribed half a do[s]e of crude opium, and called for the trepanning in[s]truments. The [s]afe doctor propo[s]ed brown paper, dipped in rum and cobwebs, to [s]taunch the blood. The popular physician, the mu[s]ical doctor, told us a jovial [s]tory; and then [s]uddenly relaxing his features, ob[s]erved, that he viewed the groaning wretch as a monument of ju[s]tice: that he, who [s]pent his days in tormenting hor[s]es, [s]hould now, by the agency of the [s]ame animal, be brought to death's door, an event, which he thought ought to be [s]et home upon our minds by prayer. While my new pupil, pre[s][s]ing through the crowd, begged that he might [s]tate the ca[s]e to the company; and, with an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] audible voice, winking upon me, began. The learned doctor Nominativo Hoc Caput, in his treati[s]e on brains, ob[s]erves that, the [s]eat of the [s]oul may be known, from the affections of the man. The re[s]idence of a wife man's [s]oul is in his ears; a glutton's, in his palate; a gallant's, in his lips; an old maid's, in her tongue; a dancer's, in his toes; a drunkard's, in his throat. By the way, landlord, give us a button of [s]ling. When we learned wi[s]h to know if a wound endangers life, we con[s]equently inquire into the affections of the patient, and [s]ee if the wound injures the [s]eat of his [s]oul. If that escapes, however deep and gha[s]tly the wound, we pronounce life in no danger. A hor[s]e jockey's [s]oul---gentlemen, I wi[s]h your healths, is in his heel, under the left [s]pur. When I was pur[s]uing my [s]tudies, in the ho[s]pitals in England, I once [s]aw [s]eventeen hor[s]e jockies, [s]ome of whom were noblemen, killed by the fall of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] [s]caffold in Newmarket, and all wounded in the heel. Twenty others, with their arms, backs, and necks broken, [s]urvived. I [s]aw one noble jockey, with his nominativo caret, which is Greek for a nobleman's head, [s]plit entirely open. His brains ran down his face, like the white of a broken egg; but, as his heel was unhurt, he [s]urvived; and his judgment in hor[s]es is [s]aid not to be the lea[s]t impaired. Come, pull off the patient's boot, while I drink his better health. Charmed with the harrangue, [s]ome of the [s]pectators were about following his directions, when the other doctors interfered. They had heard him, with di[s]dainful impatience, and now each rai[s]ed his voice, to [s]upport his particular opinion, backed by his adherents. Bring the brown paper---compound fracture--- cobwebs I [s]ay---hand the trepanning instruments--- give us [s]ome tod, and pull off the boot, echoed from all quarters. The landlord forbad quarrelling in his hou[s]e.

At the expiration of eighteen months, I found my phials, gallipots, and pur[s]e, empty; and my day book full of items. To pre[s]ent a doctor's bill, under [s]even years, or until my patients died, in which I was not nigh [s]o fortunate as my brother functioners, was complete ruin to my future practice.

I anticipated much plea[s]ure, from the interview with this truly great man: To [s]ee one, who, from [s]mall beginnings, by the [s]ole exertion of native genius, and indefatigable indu[s]try, had rai[s]ed him[s]elf to the pinnacle of politics and letters; a man, who, from an humble printer's boy, had elevated him[s]elf to be the de[s]irable companion of the great [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] ones of the earth: who, from trundling a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been advanced to pa[s]s in [s]plendour, through the courts of kings; and, from hawking vile ballads, to the contracting and signing treaties, which gave peace and independence to three millions of his fellow citizens, was a [s]ight intere[s]ting in the extreme. I found the doctor [s]urrounded by company, mo[s]t of whom were young people. He received me with the attention due to a young [s]tranger. He di[s]patched a per[s]on for the papers I wanted; a[s]ked me politely to be [s]eated; inquired after the family I [s]prang from; and told me a plea[s]ing anecdote of my brave ance[s]tor, Captain Underhill. I found, in the doctor, all that [s]implicity of language, which is remarkable in the fragment of his life, publi[s]hed [s]ince his decea[s]e; and which was con[s]picuous in my medical preceptor. I have [s]ince been in a room a few [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] hours with Governour Jay, of New York; have heard of the late Governour Living[s]ton, of New Jer[s]ey; and am now confirmed in the opinion, I have suggested, that men of genuine merit, as they po[s][s]e[s]s the e[s][s]ence, need not the parade of great knowledge. A rich man is often plain in his attire, and the man, who has abundant trea[s]ures of learning, [s]imple in his manners and [s]tile. The doctor, in early life, was economical from principle; in his latter days, perhaps from habit. Poor Richard held the pur[s]e [s]trings of the pre[s]ident of Pennsylvania. Permit me to illu[s]trate this ob[s]ervation, by an anecdote. Soon after I was introduced, an airy, thoughtle[s]s relation, from a New England [s]tate, entered the room. It [s]eems he was on a party of plea[s]ure, and had been [s]o much involved in it, for three weeks, as not to have paid his re[s]pects to his venerable relative. The purpo[s]e of his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] pre[s]ent vi[s]it was, to [s]olicit the loan of a [s]mall [s]um of money, to enable him to pay his bills, and tran[s]port him[s]elf home. He preluded his reque[s]t, with a detail of embarra[s][s]ments, which might have befallen the mo[s]t circum[s]pect. He [s]aid that he had loaded a ve[s][s]el for B---, and as he did not deal on credit, had purcha[s]ed beyond his current ca[s]h, and could not readily procure a draft upon home. The doctor, inquiring how much he wanted, he replied, with [s]ome he[s]itation, fifty dollars. The benevolent old gentleman went to his e[s]critoir, and counted him out an hundred. He received them with many promi[s]es of punctual payment, and ha[s]tily took up the writing implements, to draught a note of hand, for the ca[s]h. The doctor, who [s]aw into the nature of the borrower's embarra[s][s]ments, better than he was aware; and was possessed with the improbability of ever recovering his ca[s]h again, [s]tepped acro[s]s the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] room, laying his hand gently upon his cou[s]in's arm, [s]aid, [s]top cou[s]in, we will [s]ave the paper; a quarter of a [s]heet is not of great value, but it is worth saving: conveying, at once, a liberal gift and gentle reprimand for the borrower's prevarication and extravagance. Since I am talking of Franklin, the reader may be as unwilling to leave him as I was. Allow me to relate another anecdote. I do not recollect how the conver[s]ation was introduced; but a young per[s]on in company, mentioned his [s]urprize, that the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of great riches [s]hould ever be attended with [s]uch anxiety and solicitude; and in[s]tanced Mr. R---M---, who, he [s]aid, though in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of unbounded wealth, yet was as bu[s]y and more anxious, than the mo[s]t a[s][s]iduous clerk in his counting hou[s]e. The doctor took an apple from a fruit ba[s]ket, and pre[s]ented it to a little child, who could ju[s]t totter about the room. The child could [s]carce [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] gra[s]p it in his hand. He then gave it another, which occupied the other hand. Then choo[s]ing a third, remarkable for its [s]ize and beauty, he pre[s]ented that al[s]o. The child, after many ineffectual attempts to hold the three, dropped the la[s]t on the carpet, and bur[s]t into tears.

When we arrived at the church, we found a brilliant collection of well dre[s][s]ed people, anxiou[s]ly waiting the arrival of the par[s]on, who, it [s]eems, had a [s]mall branch of the river M--- to pa[s]s; and, we afterwards learned, was detained by the ab[s]ence of his negro boy, who was to ferry him over. Soon after, our impatience was relieved, by the arrival of the par[s]on, in his canonicals: a young man, not of the mo[s]t mortified countenance, who, with a [s]witch, called [s]upple jack, in his hand, belaboured the back and head of the faulty [s]lave, all the way from the water to the church door; accompanying every [s]troke, with [s]uitable language. He entered the church, and we followed.

I found the par[s]on as much re[s]pected on the turf, as upon the ha[s][s]oc. He was one of the judges of the race; de[s]canted, in the language of the turf, upon the points of the two rival hor[s]es, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] [s]leeve of his ca[s][s]oc was heavy laden, with the principal bets. The confidence of his pari[s]hioners was not ill founded; for they a[s][s]ured me, upon oath and honour, that he was a gentleman, of as much uprightness as his grace the archbi[s]hop of Canterbury. Ay, they would [s]port him for a [s]ermon or a [s]ong, again[s]t any par[s]on in the union. The whole of this extraordinary [s]cene was novel to me. Be[s]ides, a certain staple of New England I had with me, called con[s]cience, made my [s]ituation, in even the pa[s][s]ive part I bore in it, [s]o awkward and unea[s]y, that I could not refrain from ob[s]erving to my friend my [s]urpri[s]e at the par[s]on's conduct, in chastising his [s]ervant immediately before divine [s]ervice.

He [s]uppo[s]ed it levelled at the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] impropriety, not of the mini[s]ter, but the man; not at the act, but the [s]everity of the chastisement; and ob[s]erved, with warmth, that the par[s]on [s]erved the villain right, and, that if he had been his [s]lave, he would have killed the black ra[s]cal, if he was [s]ure he [s]hould have to pay an hundred guineas to the public trea[s]ury for him. I will note here, that the reader is requested, whenever he meets with quotations of [s]peeches, in the above [s]cenes, excepting tho[s]e during divine [s]ervice, that he will plea[s]e, that is, if his habits of life will permit, to interlard tho[s]e quotations with about as many oaths, as they countain monosylables.

Every attempt at familiarity, in a young stranger, habituated to the [s]ocial, but respectful intercour[s]e, cu[s]tomary in the northern [s]tates, excited alarm. With my New England ideas, I could not help viewing, in the anxious efforts of their parents and relatives, to repel every approach to innocent and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] even cha[s]tened intercour[s]e, a [s]trong suspicion of that virtue, they were [s]olicitous to protect. Depre[s][s]ed by the gloomy view of my pro[s]pects; and determined never to face my parents again, under circum[s]tances, which would be burthen[s]ome to them, I attempted to obtain practice in the town of F---, in Virginia, but in vain. The very decorum, prudence, and economy, which would have enhanced my character at home, were here con[s]trued into poverty of [s]pirit. To obtain medical practice, it was expedient, to [s]port, bet, drink, [s]wear, &c. with my patients. My pur[s]e forbad the former; my habits of life the latter. My ca[s]h wa[s]ted, and I was near [s]uffering. I was obliged to dispose of my books, for pre[s]ent [s]ub[s]i[s]tance; and, in that country, books were not the prime articles of commerce. To avoid [s]tarving, I again contemplated keeping a [s]chool. In that country, knowledge was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] viewed as a handicraft trade. The [s]chool ma[s]ters, before the war, had been u[s]ually collected from unfortunate European youth, of [s]ome [s]chool learning, [s]old for their pa[s][s]age into America. So that to purcha[s]e a [s]chool ma[s]ter and a negro was almo[s]t [s]ynonimous: Mr. J ---n, and [s]ome other citizens of the world, who had been ca[s]t among them, had by their writings, influence, and example, brought the knowledge of letters into [s]ome repute, [s]ince the revolution; but, I believe, tho[s]e excellent men have yet to lament the general inefficacy of their liberal efforts. This [s]tatement, and my own prior experience in [s]chool keeping, would have determined me rather to have prefered labouring, with the [s]laves on their plantations, than [s]u[s]taining the [s]lavery and contempt of a [s]chool. When reduced to my la[s]t dollar; and beginning to [s]uffer, from the embarrassments of debt, I was invited, by a [s]ea [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] captain, who knew my friends, to accept the birth of [s]urgeon, in his [s]hip. Every new pur[s]uit has its flattering pro[s]pects. I was encouraged by hand[s]ome wages, and a privilege in the [s]hip, to carry an adventure; for the purcha[s]e of which, the owners were to advance me, on account of my pay. I was to be companion to the captain, and have a fine chance of [s]eeing the world. To quit my home, for all parts of the union I con[s]idered as home; to tempt the perilous ocean, and encounter the [s]everities of a [s]ea faring life, the di[s]ea[s]es of torrid climes, and perhaps a total [s]eparation from my friends and parents, was melancholy; but the de[s]ire to [s]ee the world, to acquire practical knowledge, in my profe[s][s]ion, to obtain property, added to the nece[s][s]ity of immediate [s]ub[s]i[s]tance, and the horrours of a jail, determined me to accept his offer. I accordingly entered [s]urgeon, on board the [s]hip Freedom, Captain Sidney Ru[s][s]ell [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] commander, freighted with tobacco, bound to London, and thence to the coa[s]t of Africa.

It was the celebrated Thomas Paine, author of Common Sen[s]e, the Rights of Man, and other writings, who[s]e tendency is to overturn ancient opinions of government and religion. I met this inter[s]ting per[s]onage, at the lodgings of the [s]on of a late patriotic American governour; who[s]e genius, in the fine art of hi[s]torical painting, who[s]e fortie at Gibralter, who[s]e flowing drapery, faithful and bold expre[s][s]ion, in the portraits of our beloved pre[s]ident, and other leaders, both military and political, in our glorious revolution; when the love of the fine arts [s]hall be di[s][s]eminated in our land, will leave po[s]terity to regret and admire the imbecility of contemporary patronage. Thomas Paine re[s]embled the great apostle to the Gentiles, not more in his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] zeal and [s]ubtlety of argument, than in per[s]onal appearance; for, like that fervid apo[s]tle, his bodily pre[s]ence was both mean and contemptible. When I [s]aw him, he was dre[s][s]ed in a [s]nuff coloured coat, olive velvet ve[s]t, drab breeches, coar[s]e ho[s]e. His [s]hoe buckles of the [s]ize of half a dollar. A bob tailed wig covered that head, which worked [s]uch mickle woe to courts and kings. If I [s]hould attempt to de[s]cribe it, it would be in the [s]ame [s]tile and principle, with which the veteran [s]oldier beprai[s]eth an old [s]tandard: the more tattered, the more glorious. It is probable that this was the [s]ame identical wig, under the [s]hadow of who[s]e curls, he wrote Common Sen[s]e in America, many years before. He was a [s]pare man, rather under [s]ize; [s]ubject to the extreme of low, and highly exhilirated [s]pirits; often [s]at re[s]erved in company; [s]eldom mingled in common chit chat. But when a man of [s]en[s]e and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] elocution was pre[s]ent, and the company numerous, he delighted in advancing the mo[s]t unaccountable, and often the mo[s]t whim[s]ical, paradoxes; which he defended in his own plau[s]ible manner. If encouraged by [s]ucce[s]s, or the applau[s]e of the company, his countenance was animated, with an expre[s][s]ion of feature, which, on ordinary occa[s]ions, one would look for in vain, in a man [s]o much celebrated for acutene[s]s of thought; but if interrupted by extraneous ob[s]ervation, by the inattention of his auditory, or in an irritable moment, even by the accidental fall of the poker, he would retire into him[s]elf, and no per[s]ua[s]ions could induce him to proceed upon the mo[s]t favourite topic.

Peter [s]miled. You mu[s]t grant me, [s]aid Un common Sen[s]e, that the proportion of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] men of [s]en[s]e, to the ignorant among mankind, is at lea[s]t as twenty, thirty, or even forty nine, to an hundred. The majority of mankind are con[s]equently mo[s]t prone to errour; and, if we would atchieve right, the minority ought, in all ca[s]es, to govern. Peter continued to [s]mile archly. If we look to experience, continued Paine, for there are no conclu[s]ions I more prize than tho[s]e drawn, not from [s]peculation, but plain matter of fact, we [s]hall find an examination into the debates of all deliberative bodies, in our favour. To proceed no farther than your country, Mr. Wolcott, I love to look at home. Suppose the re[s]olutions of the hou[s]es of lords and commons had been determined by this [s]alutary rule; why, the [s]en[s]ible minority would have governed. George Wa[s]hington would have been a private citizen; and the United States of America mere colonies, dependent on the Brittish crown. As a patriotic Engli[s]hman, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] will you not con[s]e[s]s, that this would have been better than to have the[s]e United States independent, with the illu[s]trious Wa[s]hington at their head, by their wisdom confounding the juggling efforts of your mini[s]try to embroil them; and to have the comfortable pro[s]pect before you, that from the extent of their territory, their maritime re[s]ource, their natural encrease, the a[s]ylum they offer to emigrants, in the cour[s]e of two centuries, Scotland and Ireland, if the United States have not too much real pride to attempt it, may be reduced to the [s]ame dependence upon them, as your We[s]t India i[s]lands now have upon you: and even England, haughty England, thrown in as a make weight, in the future treaty between them and the French nation. Peter, who had li[s]tened with great [s]eeming attention, now mildly replied. I will not [s]ay but that your arguments are cogent, though not entirely convincing. As it is a [s]ubject [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] rather out of my line, I will, for form [s]ake, hold the negative of your proposition, and leave it to the good company, which is right. Agreed, [s]aid Paine, who [s]aw him[s]elf [s]urrounded by his admirers. Well, gentlemen, [s]aid Peter, with all the gravity of a [s]peaker of the hou[s]e of commons; you, that are of the opinion that the minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all ca[s]es, to govern the majority, plea[s]e to ri[s]e in the affirmative. Paine immediately [s]tood up him[s]elf, and, as he had fore[s]een, we all ro[s]e in his favour. Then I ri[s]e in the negative, cried Peter. I am the wi[s]e minority, who ought, in all ca[s]es, to govern your ignorant majority; and, con[s]equently, upon your own principles, I carry the vote. Let it be recorded. This unexpected manoeuvre rai[s]ed a hearty laugh. Paine retired from the pre[s]ence of triumphant wit, mortified with being [s]oiled at his own weapons.

How he came to write that unrea[s]onable little pamphlet, called the Age of Rea[s]on, I am at a lo[s]s to conjecture. The probable opinion attributes it to his pa[s][s]ion for paradox; that this [s]mall mor[s]el of infidelity was offered as a sacrifice to [s]ave his life from the devouring cruelty of Rober[s]pierre, that Moloch of the French nation. It probably had its de[s]ired effect; for annihilating revealed religion could not but afford a diabolical plea[s]ure, to that ferocious wretch and his inhuman a[s][s]ociates, who could not expect a [s]anction for their cruelties, while the lea[s]t ve[s]tige of any thing [s]acred remained among men. When the reign of the terrori[s]ts ceased, an apology was expected; and, even by the pious, yet catholic American, would have been received. To the offended religion of his country no propitiatory [s]acrifice was made. This missionary of vice has proceeded pro[s]elyting.

We were favoured with a clear [s]ky and plea[s]ant gales; and, after a [s]hort and agreeable voyage, we touched at Porto Santo, one of the Madeira i[s]les; where we watered and [s]upplied our[s]elves with fre[s]h provi[s]ions in abundance, to which the captain added, at my reque[s]t, a quantity of Madeira, malm[s]ey, and tent wines, for the [s]ick. We had a fine run, from the Madiera to the Canary i[s]les. The morning after we [s]ailed, I was highly gratified with a full view of the i[s]land and peak of Teneriff; which made its appearance the day before, ri[s]ing above the ocean, at one hundred miles di[s]tance. We anchored off Fuertaventura one of the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went on [s]hore, with the mate, to procure green vegetables; as I ever e[s]teemed them the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] [s]pecific for that dreadful [s]ea di[s]order, the [s]curvy. Before we had reached the Madeiras, though I had [s]tored our medicine che[s]t with the be[s]t anti[s]corbutics, and we had a plenty of dried vegetables on board, yet the [s]curvy had begun to infect us. A plentiful di[s]tribution of green vegetables, after our arrival at Porto Santo, [s]oon expelled it from the crew. At Fuertuventura, I was delighted with the wild notes of the Canary bird, far [s]urpa[s][s]ing the mo[s]t excellent of tho[s]e I had [s]een in cages, in the United States. I was anxious of vi[s]it the Cape de Verd i[s]lands; but, our cour[s]e being too far ea[s]t, we ran down to the little i[s]land of Goree, to which the contentions of the Engli[s]h and French crowns have annexed its only importance. The French officers received us with politene[s]s, and were extremely anxious for news, from their parent country. Soon after, we dropt anchor off Loango city, upon a [s]mall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] well peopled i[s]land, near the coa[s]t of Congo or lower Guinea, in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the Portugue[s]e. Our captain carried his papers on [s]hore, and, the next day, weighed anchor and [s]tood in for the continent. All hands were now employed to unlade the [s]hip, and the cargo was depo[s]ited in a Portugue[s]e factory, at a place called Cacongo, near the mouth of the river Zaire . The day after our arrival at Cacongo, [s]everal Portugue[s]e and Negro merchants, hardly di[s]tingui[s]hable however, by their manners, employments, or complexions, came to confer with the captain, about the purcha[s]e of our cargo of [s]laves. They contracted to deliver him two hundred and fifty head of [s]laves, in fifteen days' time. To hear the[s]e men conver[s]e upon the purcha[s]e of human beings, with the [s]ame indifference, and nearly in the [s]ame language, as if they were contracting for [s]o many head of cattle or [s]wine, [s]hocked me exceedingly. But, when I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] [s]uffered my imagination to rove to the habitation of the[s]e victims to this infamous, cruel commerce, and fancied that I [s]aw the peaceful hu[s]bandman dragged from his native farm; the fond hu[s]band torn from the embraces of his beloved wife; the mother, from her babes; the tender child, from the arms of its parent; and all the tender, endearing ties of natural and [s]ocial affection rended by the hand of avaricious violence, my heart [s]unk within me. I execrated my[s]elf, for even the involuntary part I bore in this execrable traffic: I thought of my native land and blu[s]hed. When the captain kindly inquired of me how many [s]laves I thought my privilege in the [s]hip entitled me to tran[s]port, for my adventure, I rejected my privilege, with horrour; and declared I would [s]ooner [s]uffer [s]ervitude than purcha[s]e a [s]lave. This ob[s]ervation was received in the great cabin with repeated bur[s]ts of laughter, and excited many a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] [s]troke of coar[s]e ridicule. Captain Russell ob[s]erved, that he would not in[s]i[s]t upon my u[s]ing my privilege, if I had [s]o much of the yankee about me. Here is my clerk, Ned Randolph, will jump at the chance; though the rogue has been rather unlucky in the trade. Out of five and twenty negroes he purcha[s]ed, he never carried but one alive to port; and that poor devil was broken winded, and he was obliged to [s]ell him for half price in Antigua. Punctual to the day of the delivery, the contractors appeared, and brought with them about one hundred and fifty negroes, men, women, and children. The men were fa[s]tened together, in pairs, by a bar of iron, with a collar to receive the neck at each extremity; a long pole passing over their [s]houlder, and between each two, bound by a [s]taple and ring, through which the pole was thru[s]t, and thus twenty, and [s]ometimes thirty, were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] connected together; while their conductors ince[s][s]antly applied the [s]courge to tho[s]e, who loitered, or [s]ought to [s]trangle themselves, by lifting their feet from the ground in de[s]pair, which [s]ometimes had been successfully attempted. The women and children were bound with cords, and driven forward by the whip. When they arrived at the factory, the men were unloo[s]ed from the poles; but [s]till chained in pairs, and turned into [s]trong cells, built for the purpo[s]e. The dumb sorrow of [s]ome, the frenzy of others, the [s]obbings and tears of the children, and [s]hrieks of the women, when they were pre[s]ented to our captain, [s]o affected me that I was ha[s]tening from this [s]cene of barbarity, on board the [s]hip; when I was called by the mate, and di[s]covered, to my [s]urprize and horrour, that, by my [s]tation in the [s]hip, I had a principal and active part of this inhuman tran[s]action impo[s]ed upon me. As [s]urgeon, it was my duty to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] in[s]pect the bodies of the [s]laves, to [s]ee, as the captain expre[s][s]ed him[s]elf, that our owners were not [s]hammed off with un[s]ound fle[s]h. In this in[s]pection, I was a[s][s]i[s]ted by Randolph the clerk, and two [s]tout [s]ailors. It was transacted with all that unfeeling in[s]olence, which wanton barbarity can inflict upon defencele[s]s wretchedne[s]s. The man, the affrighted child, the mode[s]t matron, and the timid virgin were alike expo[s]ed to this [s]evere [s]crutiny, to humanity and common decency equally in[s]ulting. I cannot reflect on this tran[s]action yet without [s]huddering. I have deplored my conduct with tears of anguish; and, I pray a merciful God, the common parent of the great family of the univer[s]e, who hath made of one fle[s]h and one blood all nations of the earth, that the mi[s]eries, the in[s]ults, and cruel woundings, I afterwards received, when a [s]lave [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] my[s]elf, may expiate for the inhumanity, I was nece[s][s]itated to exerci[s]e, towards the[s]e MY BRETHREN OF THE HUMAN RACE.

No [s]ooner was the purcha[s]e completed, than the[s]e wretched Africans were tran[s]ported in herds aboard the [s]hip, and immediately precipitated between decks, where a [s]trong chain, attached to a [s]taple in the lower deck, was rivetted to the bar, before de[s]cribed; and then the men were chained in pairs, and al[s]o hand cuffed, and two [s]ailors with cutla[s][s]es guarded every twenty: while the women and children were tied together in pairs with ropes, and obliged to [s]upply the men with provi[s]ions, and the [s]lu[s]h bucket; or, if the young women were relea[s]ed, it was only to gratify the brutal lu[s]t of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] sailors: for though I cannot [s]ay I ever was witne[s]s to an actual rape, yet the frequent [s]hrieks of the[s]e forlorn females in the births of the [s]eamen, left me little charity to doubt of the repeated commi[s][s]ion of that degrading crime. The eve after we had received the [s]laves on board, all hands were piped on deck, and ordered to a[s][s]i[s]t in manufacturing and knotting cat o'nine tails, the application of which, I was informed, was always nece[s][s]ary to bring the [s]laves to their appetite. The night after they came on board was [s]pent by the[s]e wretched people, in [s]obbings, groans, tears, and the mo[s]t heart rending bur[s]ts of sorrow and de[s]pair. The next morning all was [s]till. Surpri[s]ed by this unexpected [s]ilence, I almo[s]t hoped that providence, in pity to the[s]e her mi[s]erable children, had permitted [s]ome kindly [s]uffocation to put a period to their angui[s]h. It was neither novel nor unexpected to the [s]hip's crew. It is only the dumb [s]it come on, cried [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] every one. We will cure them. After breakfa[s]t, the whole [s]hip's crew went between decks, and carried with them the provi[s]ions for the [s]laves, which they one and all refu[s]ed to eat. A more affecting group of mi[s]ery was never [s]een. The[s]e injured Africans, prefering death to slavery, or perhaps buoyed above the fear of di[s][s]olution, by their religion, which taught them to look with an eye of faith to a country beyond the grave; where they [s]hould again meet tho[s]e friends and relatives, from who[s]e endearments they had been torn; and where no fiend [s]hould torment, or chri[s]tian thir[s]t for gold, had, wanting other means, re[s]olved to [s]tarve them[s]elves, and every eye lowered the fixed re[s]olve of this deadly intent. In vain were the men beaten. They refu[s]ed to ta[s]te one mouthful; and, I believe, would have died under the operation, if the ingenious cruelty of the clerk, Randolph, had not [s]ugge[s]ted the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] plan of whipping the women and children in [s]ight of the men; a[s][s]uring the men they [s]hould be tormented until all had eaten. What the torments, exercised on the bodies of the[s]e brave Africans, failed to produce, the feelings of nature effected. The Negro, who could undauntedly expire under the angui[s]h of the la[s]h, could not view the agonies of his wife, child, or his mother; and, though repeatedly encouraged by the[s]e female [s]ufferers, unmoved by their torments, to per[s]evere unto death; yet, though the man dared to die, the father relented, and in a few hours they all eat their provi[s]ions, mingled with their tears . Our [s]lave dealers being unable to fulfil their contract, unle[s]s we tarried three weeks longer, our captain concluded to remove to [s]ome other market. We accordingly weighed anchor, and [s]teered for Benin, and anchored in the river Formo[s]a, where we took in one hundred and fifteen [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] more [s]laves. The [s]ame proce[s]s in the purcha[s]e was pur[s]ued here; and, though I frequently a[s][s]ured the captain, as a physician, that it was impracticable to [s]tow fifty more per[s]ons between decks, without endangering health and life, the whole hundred and fifteen were thru[s]t, with the re[s]t, between decks. The [s]tagnant confined air of this infernal hole, rendered more deleterious by the [s]tench of the fae ces, and violent per[s]piration of [s]uch a crowd, occa[s]ioned putrid di[s]ea[s]es; and, even while in the mouth of the Formo[s]a, it was u[s]ual to throw one or two Negro corp[s]es over every day. It was in vain I remon[s]trated to the captain. In vain I enforced the nece[s][s]ity of more commodious births, and a more free influx of air for the [s]laves. In vain I repre[s]ented, that the[s]e mi[s]erable people had been u[s]ed to the vegetable diet, and pure air of a country life. That at home they were remarkable for cleanline[s]s of per[s]on, the very rites [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] of their religion con[s]i[s]ting, almo[s]t entirely, in frequent ablutions. The captain was, by this time, prejudiced again[s]t me. He ob[s]erved that he did not doubt my [s]kill, and would be bound by my advice, as to the health of tho[s]e on board his [s]hip, when he found I was actuated by the interest of the owners; but, he feared, that I was now moved by [s]ome yankee nonsense about humanity  . Randolph, the clerk, blamed me in plain terms. He [s]aid he had made [s]even African voyages, and with as good surgeons as I was; and that it was their common practice, when an infectious disorder prevailed, among the [s]laves, to make critical [s]earch for all tho[s]e, who had the [s]lighte[s]t [s]ymptoms of it, or who[s]e habits of body inclined them to it; to tie them up and ca[s]t them over the [s]hip [s]ide together, and thus, at one da[s]h, to purify the [s]hip. What [s]ignifies, added he, the lives of the black devils; they love to die. You [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] cannot plea[s]e them better, than by chucking them into the water  . When we [s]tood out to [s]ea, the rolling of the ve[s][s]el brought on the [s]ea [s]ickne[s]s, which encrea[s]ed the filth; the weather being rough, we were obliged to clo[s]e [s]ome of the ports, which ventilated the [s]pace between decks; and death raged dreadfully among the [s]laves. Above two thirds were di[s]ea[s]ed. It was affecting to ob[s]erve the gha[s]tly [s]mile on the countenance of the dying African, as if rejoicing to e[s]cape the cruelty of his oppre[s][s]ors. I noticed one man, who gathered all his [s]trength, and, in one la[s]t effort, [s]poke with great empha[s]is, and expired. I understood, by the lingui[s]t, that, with his dying breath, he invited his wife, and a boy and girl to follow him quickly, and [s]laken their thir[s]t with him at the cool [s]treams of the fountain of their Great Father, beyond the reach of the wild white bea[s]ts. The captain was now alarmed for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] [s]ucce[s]s of his voyage; and, upon my urging the nece[s][s]ity of landing the [s]laves, he ordered the [s]hip about, and we anchored near an uninhabited part of the gold coa[s]t. I conjecture not far from Cape St. Paul. Tents were erected on the [s]hore, and the [s]ick landed. Under my direction, they recovered [s]urpri[s]ingly. It was affecting to [s]ee the effect gentle u[s]age had upon the[s]e hitherto [s]ullen, ob[s]tinate people. As I had the [s]ole direction of the ho[s]pital, they looked on me as the [s]ource of this [s]udden tran[s]ition from the filth and rigour of the [s]hip, to the cleanline[s]s and kindne[s]s of the [s]hore. Their gratitude was exce[s][s]ive. When they recovered [s]o far as to walk out, happy was he, who could, by picking a few berries, gathering the wild fruits of the country, or doing any menial [s]ervices, manife[s]t his affection for me. Our lingui[s]t has told me, he has often heard them, behind the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] bu[s]hes, praying to their God for my prosperity, and a[s]king him with earne[s]tne[s]s, why he put my good black [s]oul into a white body. In twelve days all the convalescents were returned to the [s]hip, except five, who [s]taid with me on [s]hore, and were to be taken on board the next day.

The jolly boat, about ten minutes before, had made towards the [s]hore; but was recalled by a mu[s]ket [s]hot from the [s]hip. Alarmed by this unexpected manoeuvre, I ran to the top of a [s]mall hill, back of the ho[s]pital, and plainly di[s]covered a [s]quare rigged ve[s][s]el in the offing, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] endeavouring to lock our [s]hip within the land; but a land breeze [s]pringing up from the north ea[s]t, which did not extend to the [s]trange ve[s][s]el, and our [s]hip putting out all her light [s]ails, being well provided with ring [s]ail, [s]cudding [s]ails, water [s]ails, and driver, I could perceive [s]he out [s]ailed her. It was [s]oon [s]o dark that I lo[s]t [s]ight of both, and I pa[s][s]ed a night of extreme anxiety, which was increa[s]ed by, what I conjectured to be, the fla[s]hes of guns in the [s]outh we[s]t ; though at too great distance for me to hear the reports. The next morning no ve[s][s]els were to be [s]een on the coa[s]t, and the en[s]uing day was [s]pent in a [s]tate of dreadful [s]u[s]pen[s]e. Although I had provi[s]ions enough with me for [s]ome weeks, and was [s]heltered by our tents, yet to be [s]eparated from my friends and country, perhaps forever, and to fall into the hands of the barbarous people, which infe[s]ted this coa[s]t, was truly alarming. The five Africans, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] were with me, could not conceal their joy, at the departure of the [s]hip. By [s]igns they manife[s]ted their affection towards me; and, when I [s]ignified to them that the ve[s][s]el was gone not to return, they clapped their hands, and pointing inland, [s]ignified a de[s]ire to convey me to their native country, where they were [s]ure I [s]hould be happy. By their consultation, I could [s]ee that they were totally ignorant of the way. On the third day towards evening, to my great joy, I [s]aw a [s]ail approaching the [s]hore, at the pro[s]pect of which my African a[s][s]ociates manife[s]ted every [s]ign of horrour. I immediately concluded that no great blame would ari[s]e, from my not detaining five men, in the ab[s]ence of the [s]hip; and I intimated to them that they might conceal them[s]elves in the bru[s]h and e[s]cape. Four quitted me; but one, who made me comprehend, that he had a beloved [s]on among the [s]laves, refu[s]ed to go, prefering [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] the company of his child, and [s]lavery itself, to freedom and the land of his nativity. I retired to re[s]t, plea[s]ed with the imagination of [s]oon rejoining my friends, and proceeding to my native country. On the morning of the fourth day, as I was [s]leeping in my tent with the affectionate negro at my feet, I was [s]uddenly awakened, by the blowing of conch [s]hells, and the [s]ound of uncouth voices. I arose to dre[s]s my[s]elf, when the tent was over[s]et, and I received a blow from the back of a [s]abre, which levelled me to the earth; and was immediately [s]eized and bound by [s]everal men of [s]allow and fierce demeanour, in [s]trange habits, who [s]pake a language I could not comprehend. With the negro, tents, baggage, and provi[s]ions, I was carried to the boat, which, being loaded, was immediately pu[s]hed off from the [s]hore, and rowed towards a ve[s][s]el, which I now, for the fir[s]t time, noticed, and had no doubt but it was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] the [s]ame, which was in pur[s]uit of the Sympathy. She was rigged differently from any I had ever [s]een, having two ma[s]ts, a large [s]quare main [s]ail, another of equal [s]ize, [s]eized by the middle of a main yard to her fore ma[s]t, and, what the sailors call, a [s]houlder of mutton [s]ail abaft; which, with top [s]ails and two banks of oars, impelled her through the water with amazing velocity: though, from the clum[s]ine[s]s of her rigging, an American [s]eaman would never have pronounced her a good [s]ea boat. On her main ma[s]t head was a broad black pennant, with a half moon, or rather cre[s]cent, and a drawn [s]abre, in white and red, emblazoned in the middle. The [s]ides of the ve[s][s]el were manned as we approached, and a tackle being let down, the hook was attached to the cord, which bound me, and I was hoi[s]ted on board in the twinkling of an eye. Then, being unbound, I was carried upon the quarter deck, where a man, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] appeared to be the captain, glittering in [s]ilks, pearl, and gold, [s]et cro[s]s legged upon a velvet cu[s]hing to receive me. He was nearly encircled by a band of men, with mon[s]trous tufts of hair on their upper lips, dre[s][s]ed in habits of the [s]ame mode with their leader's, but of coar[s]er contexture, with drawn [s]cimitars in their hands, and by his [s]ide a man of lighter complexion, who, by the captain's command, inquired of me, in good Engli[s]h, if I was an Engli[s]hman. I replied I was an American, a citizen of the United States. This was no [s]ooner interpreted to the captain than, at a di[s]dainful nod of his head, I was again [s]eized, hand cuffed, and thru[s]t into a dirty hole in the fore ca[s]tle, where I lay twenty four hours, without [s]traw to [s]leep on, or any thing to eat or drink. The treatment we gave the unhappy Africans, on board the Sympathy, now came full into my mind; and, what was the more mortifying, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] discovered that the negro who was, captured with me, was at liberty, and fared as well as the [s]ailors on board the ve[s][s]el. I had not however been confined more than one half hour, when the interpreter came to examine me privately re[s]pecting the de[s]tination of the [s]hip, to which he suspected I belonged; was anxious to know if [s]he had her full cargo of [s]laves; what was her force; whether [s]he had Engli[s]h papers on board; and if [s]he did not intend to [s]top at [s]ome other African port. From him I learned that I was captured by an Algerine Rover, Hamed Hali Saad captain; and [s]hould be carried into [s]lavery at Algiers. After I had lain twenty four hours in this loath[s]ome place, covered with vermin, parched with thir[s]t, and fainting with hunger, I was [s]tartled at a light, let through the hatchway, which opened [s]oftly, and a hand pre[s]ented me a cloth, dripping with cold water, in which a [s]mall quantity of boiled rice was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] wrapped. The door clo[s]ed again [s]oftly, and I was left to enjoy my good fortune in the dark. If Abraham had indeed [s]ent Lazarus to the rich man, in torment, it appears to me, he could not have received a greater plea[s]ure, from the cool water on his tongue, than I experienced, in [s]ucking the moi[s]ture from this cloth. The next day, the [s]ame kindly hand appeared again, with the [s]ame refre[s]hment. I begged to [s]ee my benefactor. The door opened further, and I [s]aw a countenance in tears. It was the face of the grateful African, who was taken with me. I was oppre[s][s]ed with gratitude. Is this, exclaimed I, one of tho[s]e men, whom we are taught to vilify as beneath the human [s]pecies, who brings me [s]u[s]tenance, perhaps at the ri[s]k of his life, who [s]hares his mor[s]el with one of tho[s]e barbarous men, who had recently torn him from all he held dear, and who[s]e ba[s]e companions are now tran[s]porting his darling [s]on to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] a grievous [s]lavery? Grant me, I ejaculated, once more to ta[s]te the freedom of my native country, and every moment of my life [s]hall be dedicated to preaching again[s]t this dete[s]table commerce. I will fly to our fellow citizens in the [s]outhern [s]tates; I will, on my knees, conjure them, in the name of humanity, to aboli[s]h a trafic, which cau[s]es it to bleed in every pore. If they are deaf to the pleadings of nature, I will conjure them, for the [s]ake of con[s]i[s]tency, to cea[s]e to deprive their fellow creatures of freedom, which their writers, their orators, repre[s]entatives, [s]enators, and even their con[s]titutions of government, have declared to be the unalienable birth right of man. My [s]able friend had no occa[s]ion to vi[s]it me a third time; for I was taken from my confinement, and, after being [s]tripped of the few clothes, and the little property I chanced to have about me, a log was fa[s]tened to my leg by a chain, and I was permitted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v1&image=407-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] to walk the fore ca[s]tle of the ve[s][s]el, with the African and [s]everal Spani[s]h and Portuguese pri[s]oners. The treatment of the [s]laves, who plied the oars, the management of the ve[s][s]el, the order which was ob[s]erved among this ferocious race, and [s]ome notices of our voyage, might afford ob[s]ervations, which would be highly gratifying to my readers, if the limits of this work would permit. I will ju[s]t observe however that the regularity and frequency of their devotion was a[s]toni[s]hing to me, who had been taught to con[s]ider this people as the mo[s]t bla[s]phemous in[s]idels. In ten days after I was captured, the Rover pa[s][s]ed up the [s]traits of Gibralter, and I heard the garri[s]on evening gun fired from that formidable rock; and the next morning hove in [s]ight of the city of Algiers.
