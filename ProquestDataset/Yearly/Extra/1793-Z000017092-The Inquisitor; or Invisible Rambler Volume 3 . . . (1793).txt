Annie [s]trayed toward the water [s]ide. Some venerable trees grew on the banks, forming a covert from the [s]un at noon; and, by their interwoven branches, in[s]piring a [s]ort of plea[s]ing melancholy in the gray twilight of the evening. Annie was a [s]entimental girl---[s]he loved [s]olitude, poetry, and mu[s]ic.---With a mind [s]oftened by the remembrance of [s]ome former occurrences of her life, and [s]pirits calmed, but not depre[s][s]ed, by the [s]olemn [s]ilence and [s]erenity of every thing around her, [s]he wandered on, meditating on the happy [s]tate of tho[s]e who were in a [s]ituation to enjoy unmole[s]ted the darling plea[s]ures of reading, meditation, and friendship. Whether love had any [s]hare in her thoughts at that moment, I never could get her to con[s]e[s]s---but, whether a [s]entimental young woman, wandering in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] a [s]olitary walk, and contemplating the works of nature, might not naturally enough wi[s]h for a bo[s]om friend to participate in her plea[s]ures, and join in an innocent conver[s]ation, I leave to my fair readers to determine---to be [s]ure, [s]he might wi[s]h for a female companion; very likely [s]he did; but it is a point I never could determine. In this [s]hady walk Annie was acco[s]ted by Mr. Winlove. Mr. Winlove was a gentleman of fortune, to who[s]e family Annie had been recommended by a particular friend as an innocent, well-di[s]po[s]ed girl.--- She frequently vi[s]ited Mrs. Winlove---[s]he had received numberle[s]s civilities from her hu[s]band--- there could be no harm in walking two or three turns with a married man---[s]he accepted his proferred arm, and they proceeded together. I had been wi[s]hing for an agreeable companion in this walk, Annie, [s]aid he. Why did you not bring Mrs. Winlove with you? 'Tis a natural que[s]tion; Annie, but a wife is not always the mo[s]t agreeable companion. I am much better plea[s]ed with your company than I [s]hould be with hers Annie had been brought up in the [s]tricte[s]t principles of virtue; [s]he had likewi[s]e imbibed [s]ome [s]trange, ob[s]olete notions concerning honor, piety, integrity, and the like. She, therefore, thought it [s]trange that a man [s]hould prefer the company of an indifferent per[s]on, to that of the woman to whom he had vowed eternal love and con[s]tancy. How can you talk [s]o incon[s]i[s]tently, Mr. Winlove? [s]aid [s]he; [s]urely my company cannot be preferable to that of the woman of your choice. Do people never marry from any other motives than inclination? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] I have heard, indeed, [s]aid Annie, of marriages of intere[s]t, where avarice, not love, lighted the hymeneal torch; but I have too good an opinion of Mr. Winlove to think he could be bia[s][s]ed by [s]o [s]ordid a motive. How I am delighted to find that you entertain [s]o high an opinion of me, my dear creature; and yet it pains me. Oh, why am I denied the power of be[s]towing myself and fortune on a woman every way [s]o amiable. Annie was going to interrupt him, but he stopped her, and proceeded.--- Be not offended, my [s]weet angel, you have no idea of the mi[s]eries of my [s]ituation; drawn into a cur[s]ed connection with a woman who has neither beauty, merit, nor accompli[s]hments to render her a de[s]irable companion---a woman for whom I have not the lea[s]t tenderne[s]s, and whom I married from a mi[s]taken point of honor---unhappy wretch that I am, I mu[s]t now daily [s]ee you, charming Annie, lovely, amiable, accompli[s]hed, yet obliged to earn a [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, when nature formed you to move in a [s]phere more exalted, more [s]uited to your gentle di[s]po[s]ition.---The[s]e hands, dear girl, were not formed for labour---he took one hand and pre[s][s]ed it tenderly to his lips. Now, however Annie might be inclined to reprove Mr. Winlove in the beginning of this address, the latter part of it was [s]o prettily mixed with prai[s]es of her[s]elf, that [s]he could not well determine whether to be plea[s]ed or offended---[s]he therefore continued [s]ilent. Annie was the daughter of a merchant; had been well educated; and being [s]uppo[s]ed to have a large fortune, was early introduced into the [s]chool of gallantry, and her ears invaded by the voice of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] adulation---[s]he was pretty---how could [s]he avoid knowing it? [s]he had heard an hundred different men [s]wear it; her gla[s]s confirmed their oaths.--- She was naturally [s]en[s]ible; but [s]he was vain, and a little inclined to cequetry.---Her father died insolvent--- [s]he was taken from a [s]cene of grandeur, and apprenticed to a milliner.---She was good-natured; every body loved her---[s]he [s]ubmitted to her fate without repining, and endeavoured to render herself u[s]eful in her new occupation.---But, alas! poor Annie, [s]he loved the [s]oft numbers of a Dryden or a Pope, much better than the [s]tudy of the fa[s]hions; and would prefer [s]pending an hour at her pen, before the formation of the mo[s]t elegant ornament for the per[s]on. It is not to be wondered at that [s]he was delighted by the voice of flattery, [s]ince [s]he had [s]eldom, from her cradle, been accu[s]tomed to any other. Mr. Winlove was artful; he ea[s]ily di[s]covered the method by which he might gain the good will of this [s]imple girl; and imperceptibly changed the [s]ubject, from admiring the beauties of her per[s]on, to commend the graces of her mind.---He then inquired into the nature of her [s]tudies; commended her ta[s]te in the [s]election of authors; ventured gently to laugh at her ideas of religion; called them [s]uper[s]titious; [s]aid [s]he was a novice in the ways of the world, and openly avowed a pa[s][s]ion for her. At fir[s]t her looks plainly indicated her horror and amazement---She trembled---[s]hrunk from him, and telling him [s]he was [s]hocked to find the per[s]on [s]he had [s]uppo[s]ed her friend, was her bittere[s]t enemy, bur[s]t into tears. Had Annie acted with propriety [s]he would have in[s]tantly left him; but he attempted to palliate his offence---[s]he [s]taid to hear him. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] How can you call me your enemy, dear Annie, [s]aid he---though I doat on you almo[s]t to madne[s]s, I would not injure you to obtain an empire. I will curb my pa[s][s]ion; it [s]hall be pure, exalted friend[s]hip that warms our bo[s]oms; we may be friends, my [s]weet girl; you cannot re[s]u[s]e me that token of your e[s]teem. Let your actions teach me to e[s]teem you, Mr. Winlove---I will be the friend of no man who pretends to laugh at all obligations moral and religious. Mr. Winlove by degrees led her into a di[s]pute--- Annie was not a match in argument with this insidious friend; he was a [s]ophi[s]t; he preferred the laws of nature; called religion prie[s]tcraft; brought innumerable proofs to convince her that her opinion was fallacious, and that [s]he was entirely ignorant of the road to happine[s]s, if [s]he [s]uppo[s]ed it was to be found by [s]trictly adhering to the mu[s]ty rules pre[s]cribed by the aged and captious, who, unable any longer to enjoy the plea[s]ures of youth, would deprive others of their [s]hare. Take example, dear Annie, [s]aid he, from the excellent Eloi[s]e of Rouffeau. She had never read it. He recommended it very [s]trongly for her perusal. As [s]he returned home, pa[s][s]ing a library, Mr. Winlove purcha[s]ed the pernicious novel, and gave it to Annie. She took it home---[s]he read it---her judgment was perverted---[s]he believed in the reality of a platonic pa[s][s]ion---[s]he thought [s]he had the virtue of an Eloi[s]e, and Mr. Winlove the honor of a St. Preux. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] Churchill was the next author that was recommended. She read---[s]he li[s]tened to the [s]oft language of love, and imbibed pernicious poi[s]on from every page [s]he read, and every word [s]he heard. Tru[s]ting to her own [s]trength and virtue, [s]he made a private a[s][s]ingnation---met him---confe[s][s]ed [s]he loved him---and was lo[s]t. But little now remains to be told. A few months convinced her, that when honor is forfeited, love cannot exi[s]t. Mr. Winlove for[s]ook her. Her reputation [s]tained---without friends---without peace---de[s]pi[s]ed and in[s]ulted by her own [s]ex, pitied by the other, and renounced by her uncle, who had bound her apprentice, [s]he became the a[s][s]ociate of the abandoned and profligate; and reduced to chu[s]e the dreadful alternative of death or infamy, became a partner in vices which once [s]he would have [s]huddered but to think on. And this man pleaded love as an incitement to the ruin of the poor, [s]imple Annie. What is love? It is a que[s]tion which would be an[s]wered different ways, according to the age and [s]ituation of the per[s]on to whom it is addre[s][s]ed---Love! cries the lively girl, who[s]e imagination is warmed by the peru[s]al of a [s]entimental novel---love is the cordial drop Heaven has thrown in, to [s]weeten the bitter draught of life---without love we can only exi[s]t--- [s]weet [s]oother of our cares! that can [s]trew ro[s]es on. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] the coar[s]e[s]t bed, and make the mo[s]t homely fair delicious.---Give me love and Strephon, an humble cottage [s]haded with woodbine; for love will render the retreat delightful! Charmed with the enchanting [s]cene her bu[s]y fancy draws, [s]he imagines happine[s]s exi[s]ts only in a cottage; and that for the love of her dear Strephon, [s]he could ea[s]ily, and without regret, forego all the indulgencies of her father's hou[s]e; all the advantages of wealth, and [s]olace her[s]elf with a brown cru[s]t and a pitcher of milk. But then her Strephon will always be near her, ever whi[s]pering his love, and [s]tudying to promote her felicity: fired with the[s]e romantic ideas, [s]he takes the fir[s]t opportunity of quitting her home; and without a moment's deliberation, throws her[s]el[s] upon the honor of a man, who, perhaps, had no further regard for her than the hope of [s]haring her fortune might excite. A[s]k this [s]ame woman, [s]ome few months after, when poverty has vi[s]ited her dwelling, and umasked the real de[s]igns of her hu[s]band, a[s]k her then what love is---her an[s]wer will be, it is a fooli[s]h, head[s]trong pa[s][s]ion, who[s]e plea[s]ures exi[s]t merely in imagination; a blind hood-winked deity, who leads on his votaries by promi[s]es of everla[s]ting felicity; and when too late for retreat, di[s]covers his real a[s]pect, and plunges them into inevitable misery.--- Yet this woman's ideas of love were both erroneous---the rea[s]on of which was, [s]he had never really felt the effects of that exalted pa[s][s]ion. A[s]k the libertine what is love? Innocence trembles at his an[s]wer; religion and virtue replies, it is ruin, infamy and [s]hame. The old, avaricious, captious wretch will tell [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] you, there is no [s]uch thing as love; that it never exi[s]ted but in romances, plays, and novels. Then pray, Mr. Inqui[s]itor, what is your opinion of love? Real love was born of Beauty, nur[s]ed by Innocence, and its life prolonged by good [s]en[s]e, affability and prudence---it con[s]i[s]ts of a [s]trict union of [s]oul and parity of [s]entiment between two per[s]ons of different [s]exes---its con[s]tant attendants are honor, integrity, candour, humility, good nature, and chearfulne[s]s. A pa[s][s]ion of this kind elevates the [s]oul, and inspires it with fortitude to bear the various vicissitudes of life without complaining---from [s]uch a pa[s][s]ion proceeds all the endearing ties of nature--- Father, brother, hu[s]band, wife, mother, daughter; names, the very [s]ound of which will make every fibre of the heart vibrate with plea[s]ure. What noble, prai[s]e-worthy actions have men performed when animated by the e[s]teem and love of a de[s]erving object; even women have forgot the weakne[s]s of their [s]ex, and [s]uffered hard[s]hips, combated perils, and braved even the threats of war, for the [s]ake of a beloved hu[s]band.---It opens the heart to all the gentle virtues which ornament [s]ociety--- the heart [s]u[s]ceptible of love is never callous to the feelings of humanity; he never beholds a di[s]tre[s][s]ed object but he immediately wi[s]hes to relieve it, not that he feels [s]o much for the per[s]on's [s]uffering as for tho[s]e who may [s]uffer with or for their di[s]tre[s]s, [s]uch as a wife, hu[s]band, or parent.---It is a pa[s][s]ion which, when in[s]pired by virtue, and guided by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] religion and rea[s]on, dignifies mankind---a pa[s][s]ion which ornaments the highe[s]t [s]tation, and adds new lu[s]tre even to the Briti[s]h diadem. Illu[s]trious pair! who[s]e every action tends to point the way to real happine[s]s; long, long may you reign the pride and ble[s][s]ing of your people--- May your bright example [s]pread throughout the kingdom, till Hymen, led by Love and Honor, [s]hall reign triumphant o'er the Briti[s]h nation. It is very extraordinary, but I never can fini[s]h with the [s]ubject I begin upon---I began a definition of Love, and I ramble immediately to the King and Queen; and how was it po[s][s]ible I could do otherwise when love and harmony was the theme. My fair country-women, you who[s]e hearts are formed by nature open to every gentle, generous [s]entiment, beware of Love---there are many deceivers who a[s][s]ume his appearance, and [s]teal unsuspected into the heart; but of all the various [s]hapes it a[s][s]umes, none is [s]o much to be dreaded as the [s]pecious ma[s]k of friend[s]hip.---There has been more women lo[s]t through platonic love than any other; and the rea[s]on is, they are thrown entirely off their guard, and have not the lea[s]t doubt of the [s]trength of their own virtue, or their lover's honor, till both are forfeited pa[s]t redemption. But all this is digre[s][s]ing from Annie's [s]tory. When [s]he had fini[s]hed her relation I took her into a hackney coach, and conveyed her home--- candidly told my dear Emma the circum[s]tance of our meeting, and a[s]ked her advice in what manner to di[s]po[s]e of the poor girl. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] We tried her penitence; found it [s]incere; and willing to encourage her in virtue, recommended her to the [s]ervice of a lady who[s]e example confirmed tho[s]e [s]entiments which were newly returning to be inmates of Annie's bo[s]om. I have frequently [s]een her [s]ince, and experience a thou[s]and times more [s]atisfaction in the reflection that I have [s]natched her from infamy, than the man of plea[s]ure can feel who rai[s]es the object of his guilty pur[s]uit from the lowe[s]t [s]tation, to affluence and grandeur. That is but a bad compari[s]on neither; the two actions cannot come in competition with each other, [s]ince the fir[s]t elevates human nature, the latter deba[s]es it. I have often been [s]urpri[s]ed to find that per[s]ons who are po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of elegant villas, and are at liberty to di[s]po[s]e of their time as they think proper, [s]hould prefer [s]pending it in London. For my own part I [s]hould hardly pa[s]s one month of the twelve in that [s]eat of commerce and bu[s]tle, were it not for unavoidable obligations. I find the pure[s]t plea[s]ures ari[s]e from a walk in a plea[s]ant meadow, hedged round with hawthorn, in a [s]weet May morning, when the lark attunes her early [s]ong, and chants forth the prai[s]es of her Creator; to [s]ee bright Phoebus leave his watery bed and ki[s]s away Aurora's pearly tears which hang upon the opening flowers. Drive on, [s]aid I to the po[s]tillion, I long to be at my journey's end, and I mu[s]t po[s]itively dine at Friendly Hall to-day.

He was an arch-looking boy, with curly hair, very decently dre[s][s]ed, and ran along by the [s]ide of the carriage with [s]urpri[s]ing agility.---I threw him out [s]ome halfpence; and looking out of the window to ob[s]erve him pick them up, I [s]aw a young man who had greatly the appearance of a gentleman, eagerly take the money from the child, and go into the cottage. I had [s]carcely mentioned the circum[s]tance to my Emma, before the po[s]tillion driving carele[s]sly over a heap of [s]tones, one of the wheels gave way, and down came the coach. At another time I [s]hould undoubtedly have [s]worn at the po[s]tillion, and thrown my[s]elf into a violent pa[s][s]ion from which I might not have recovered the whole day.---At pre[s]ent, as there was no harm done, the accident only coincided with my wi[s]hes, which led me towards the cottage; [s]o helping my Emma out, and taking Harriet in one hand and Lucy in the other, we walked into the humble habitation. The young man was [s]eated by a woman who[s]e face had never been remarkable for beauty, but was irre[s]i[s]tibly charming, over [s]hadowed by melancholy, and adorned by [s]en[s]ibility.---Her fine auburn hair [s]he had endeavoured to confine under a [s]mall lawn cap, but it had broke from its bandage, and played in wanton ringlets round her face. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] A child about three months old was at her brea[s]t, and the boy to whom I had given the halfpence, was making boats with bits of wood, and swimming them in a pail of water that [s]tood in a corner of the room. As we entered, the young man glanced his eyes upon his cloaths; his cheeks a[s][s]umed a [s]anguine hue.---They certainly were thread-bare; but what of that? they had once been new, and from what remained we could [s]ee they had once been elegant; perhaps it was that very circum[s]tance which distressed him. Whatever circum[s]tances a per[s]on is in, you may always di[s]cover by their behaviour whether they have been innured to their [s]ituation from childhood.--- A per[s]on who has never known any thing but poverty, [s]hews no other mark of chagrin at the entrance of a [s]tranger than what proceeds from an aukwardne[s]s of manner which they ever betray when in the company of their [s]uperiors---and rai[s]e that per[s]on to the mo[s]t exalted [s]tation, and you will [s]till perceive the [s]ame di[s]gu[s]ting aukwardne[s]s and ru[s]ticity.---So, place a man of education in ever [s]o ob[s]cure a [s]ituation, you will always discover the manners of the gentleman, though ob[s]cured by the garb of the beggar. I, therefore, no [s]ooner beheld the young man than I di[s]covered that he had not always worn a thread-bare coat, or lived from his childhood in a cottage.

Could you procure us a little bread and milk, [s]aid I, to the young woman. We have none in the hou[s]e, Sir, [s]he replied, vi[s]ibly embarra[s][s]ed; and it is above two miles to another cottage. The young man turned pale as a[s]hes. Give me my money, mother, [s]aid the boy, and I will go and buy [s]ome. She he[s]itated, and the boy proceeded. I think it is time we had [s]ome breakfa[s]t---I am [s]ure I am hungry---and [s]o are you---I heard you [s]ay [s]o, or I [s]hould not have begged of the gentlefolks. He will di[s]cover our poverty, [s]aid the father, forcing a [s]mile.---The mother turned from us and wept. Pardon me, Madam, [s]aid Emma, if I a[s]k the cau[s]e of your tears---it is not curio[s]ity, but a wi[s]h to [s]erve you occa[s]ions the que[s]tion. Pride and poverty, replied the young man, struggling to [s]uppre[s]s his emotions. Will this relieve you, [s]aid I, offering him a few guineas.--- Though I am almo[s]t [s]tarving, [s]aid he, I feel more angui[s]h than [s]atisfaction at the offer; nor would I accept it but for my wife and children. It is extraordinary that there is [s]uch an innate pride implanted in the mind of [s]ome men that they are a[s]hamed of poverty, though it was entailed upon them by unavoidable misfortunes; and I am [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] certain that people of this ca[s]t, in receiving favours, though perhaps tho[s]e favours rai[s]e them from a [s]tate of penury to plenty, feel a larger [s]hare of pain than plea[s]ure---the noble mind is always pained when labouring under the weight of obligations. Now, [s]hame upon the world for occa[s]ioning this---were it not that there is greater re[s]pect paid to the gilded equipage, glaring liveries, and embroidered cloaths, than to the poor atom of clay that is attended by all this pomp, a man would never blu[s]h at poverty when it was attended by honor and virtue. I do not mean hereditary honor, I mean a nobleness of [s]oul, an elevation of [s]entiment, an integrity of heart, that would rather bear the laugh of the world for keeping within the [s]trict rules of oeconomy than [s]uffer a trade[s]man's bill to go unpaid, or a fellow creature to want [s]u[s]tenance. A man of real honor will not always draw his [s]word at every trivial offence; but he ever [s]tands forth the undaunted champion of innocence and virtue---he al[s]o holds his friend's wife or daughter as [s]acred, regards them with e[s]teem, and treats them with re[s]pect. The modern man of honor is quite a different creature; he mu[s]t have his plea[s]ures whether he can afford to pay for them or not; he will [s]teal his friend's fortune at the gaming table; debauch his wife, or en[s]nare his daughter, and then run him through the body by way of reparation.

Sir, my forefathers were Earls, or Dukes, or Princes.---Sir, I have noble blood in my veins, which has flowed uncontaminated through twenty generations. Yes, Sir, but your ance[s]tors were cruel, or unju[s]t, or ambitious, or avaricious, or proud, or revengeful.--- But they were Earls, or Dukes, or Princes.--- That is the convincing argument; and my Lord [s]its down perfectly contented with the reflection that he is right honorable by birth, and never gives him[s]elf the trouble to perform one honorable action during the whole cour[s]e of his life. And, pray what has this to do with the cottagers. Faith I don't know that it has the lea[s]t connection with them; but I never can pre[s]cribe rules for my pen, any more than I can confine my thoughts to one [s]ingle object.---To write [s]traight forward, is like an hackney hor[s]e that, [s]etting out from the fir[s]t [s]tage, continues in the beaten track till he arrives at the end of his journey---for my part I hate [s]uch in[s]ipid travelling; mine is a journey of plea[s]ure, and I will turn out of the road as often as I plea[s]e totake a view of any thing amu[s]ing or entertaining. The young man went out and procured [s]ome refre[s]hment, of which we partook, and, after the repa[s]t was fini[s]hed, the wife prepared to give us her own and hu[s]band's hi[s]tory.--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] She laid her infant to [s]leep, [s]et her apartment in proper order; and, having [s]et a mug of cyder (which her hu[s]band had brought in) upon the table, [s]at down to gratify the curio[s]ity [s]he had [s]o [s]trongly excited.--- At that in[s]tant a fat old man rode up to the door, di[s]mounted, fa[s]tened his hor[s]e to a tree, and entered. I never ca[s]t my eye upon a [s]tranger but I immediately form [s]ome idea of his or her di[s]po[s]itions by the turn of their eyes and ca[s]t of their features; and though my [s]kill in phy[s]iognomy is not infallible, I [s]eldom find my[s]elf deceived. The old man had a [s]ort of haughtine[s]s in his carriage, which [s]eemed the re[s]ult of mean pride and [s]elf-[s]ufficiency; his per[s]on was coar[s]e, his manner rude, his language almo[s]t in[s]ulting. I am [s]urpri[s]ed, [s]aid he, to the young man, that you have not brought me your la[s]t half year's rent--- I have repeatedly [s]ent, and will no longer be put off by your trifling excu[s]es---I am now come for the money, and will not depart without it. Sir, [s]aid the young man, we have it not; and to add to our misfortunes, two days [s]ince our cattle was [s]eized for a [s]mall [s]um which we owed in the neighbourhood.--- Money I want, and money I will have, [s]aid the man---a large [s]um is to be made up this week, and I will not wait any longer---if you do not [s]end me the rent within two days, I will turn you out of the cottage, fir[s]t [s]eizing what [s]tock you have. Confound this money, [s]aid I; it is the occa[s]ion of more ill will and diffention than any thing el[s]e in the world. Why, pray, young man, [s]aid he, what would you do without money? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] I was dre[s][s]ed very plainly---[s]o was Emma and the children---he had not [s]een the carriage that was repairing; or if he had, he could never have supposed it was mine. He addre[s][s]ed me, therefore, by this familiar epithet, on account of his [s]uppo[s]ed [s]uperiority; and as he pronounced the words young man , he a[s][s]umed [s]uch an air of [s]elf-[s]ufficiency, and [s]at him[s]elf back in the chair with [s]uch an in[s]ulting a[s][s]urance, that I had hardly patience to an[s]wer him calmly. If there was no money in the world, [s]aid I, there would be no extortion: and, I fancy then, you, my good friend, would find but little employment. One of my [s]ervants then informed me that the carriage was ready---I enquired of my young ho[s]t if this was his landlord, and was informed he was only [s]teward to Lord M---: I became answerable for the rent, and determined, on my return to town, to pay a vi[s]it to his Lord[s]hip, and inform him of the nece[s][s]itous [s]ituation of his tenants. One evening as I was rambling out, I observed a man [s]itting on the trunk of an old tree, with a paper and pencil in his hand; at fir[s]t I [s]uppo[s]ed him to be drawing, but, on a nearer approach, I found him to be writing. Pray, Sir, [s]aid I, advancing, and paying him the compliments of the evening, what may be the subject which [s]o agreeably engages your attention? I pre[s]ume you are [s]acrificing at the [s]hrine of the Mu[s]es---I am, Sir, [s]aid he, ri[s]ing and putting the paper in his pocket---I have been writing all this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] [s]ummer, and in the winter I hope to have my works in print---It is a novel, Sir, entirely calculated to amu[s]e--- In how many volumes? Two. And are you [s]ure of [s]elling them? I am engaged, Sir, to write for a per[s]on who [s]carcely ever publi[s]hes any thing but novels. What may be the plot or foundation of your novel? It is called Annabella; or Suffering Innocence \--- my heroine is beautiful, accompli[s]hed, and rich; an only child, and [s]urrounded by admirers---[s]he contracts an attachment for a man, her inferior in point of birth and fortune; but honorable, handsome, &c.---She has a female friend to whom [s]he relates all that pa[s][s]es in her brea[s]t---her hopes, fears, meetings, partings, &c.---She is treated hardly by her friends---combats innumerable difficulties in the [s]entimental way, but at la[s]t overcomes them all, and is made the bride of the man of her heart. P[s]haw, [s]aid I, that is [s]tale; there are at this pre[s]ent day above two thou[s]and novels in exi[s]tence which begin and end exactly in the [s]ame way--- the novel writers have now taken another road; and, if you will give me leave, I will ju[s]t give you a few hints which may, perhaps, be of [s]ome service to you in writing a novel in future. In the fir[s]t place, your heroine mu[s]t fall violently in love with an all-accompli[s]hed youth at a very early age---keep her pa[s][s]ion concealed from her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] parents or guardians; but bind her[s]elf in her own mind to wed no other than this dear, fir[s]t conqueror of her heart---ill-natured, proud, ambitious fathers are very nece[s][s]ary to be introduced---kind, affectionate, amiable mothers. The [s]uperlative beauty and accompli[s]hments of your heroine, or perhaps the [s]plendor of her fortune, mu[s]t attract the attention of a man diametrically oppo[s]ite in person and di[s]po[s]ition to her fir[s]t lover---the father mu[s]t threaten---the mother entreat---and the lover be very urgent for the completion of his felicity---remember to mix a [s]ufficient quantity of [s]ighs, tears, [s]wooning, hy[s]terics, and all the moving expre[s][s]ions of heart-rending woe---her filial duty mu[s]t triumph over inclination; and [s]he mu[s]t be led like a victim to the altar.--- So much for the fir[s]t part. The [s]econd volume di[s]plays her angelic, her exemplary conduct in the character of a wife---the hu[s]band mu[s]t be jealous, brutal, fond of gaming, keep a mi[s]tre[s]s, lavi[s]h all his fortune on [s]harpers and lewd women---the wife pious, gentle, obedient and re[s]igned--- Be [s]ure you contrive a duel; and, if convenient, a [s]uicide might not be ami[s]s---lead your heroine through wonderful trials---let her have the fortitude of an anchorite; the patience of an angel---but in the end, [s]end her fir[s]t hu[s]band to the other world, and unite her to the fir[s]t po[s][s]e[s][s]or of her heart--- join a few other incidents; [s]uch as the hi[s]tory of her bo[s]om friend, and a confidant---Manage your plot in [s]uch a manner as to have [s]ome [s]urpri[s]ing di[s]covery made---wind up with two or three marriages; and the [s]uperlative felicity of all the dramatics per[s]onoe  .

When I fir[s]t commenced Author, continued he, I wrote on religion and philo[s]ophy; but I found in the fir[s]t I could gain no reputation unle[s]s I wrote in the enthu[s]ia[s]tic [s]tile of a Methodi[s]t; and the latter was too ob[s]tru[s]e a [s]tudy for the young and gay, required too much time for the old, and was totally improper for the ignorant and illiterate --- My books would not fell --- I had frequently applied to a per[s]on eminent for his numerous publications. He told me if I wi[s]hed to get a living I mu[s]t write to amu[s]e rather than in[s]truct the world; and that if I would write him a good novel in two volumes, he would give me ten guineas for it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] He thought, no doubt, ten guineas was a very large [s]um to be put into the hands of a poor author: to deal candidly, I [s]hould have been very glad at that time of a fifth part of the [s]um---but to proceed--- I was not at all conver[s]ant in that [s]ort of reading; but finding it ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary, I borrowed [s]ome of the be[s]t e[s]teemed modern novels from a library, and began to peru[s]e them with great attention, but there was a [s]amene[s]s in the generality of them that di[s]gu[s]ted, and a loo[s]ene[s]s in the language of others that [s]hocked me. It is indeed [s]hocking, [s]aid I, to [s]ee [s]o many reams of paper expended in u[s]hering to the world pernicious pages, which tend to vitiate the ta[s]te and corrupt the heart. When the heroine of a novel is repre[s]ented as flying in the face of filial duty, eloping, running into the very lap of danger, braving the authority of her parents, and forgetting the decorum and delicacy which ought to be the characteristic of the female [s]ex, and yet, in the end meets with every ble[s][s]ing, every comfort, [s]he can wi[s]h; is it not enough to ruin the weak head and unwary heart, by leading them to think true felicity is to be found by following the bent of their own inclinations, though never [s]o wayward and oppo[s]ite to the advice of their friends or the dictates of rea[s]on? Nor can I think that the more modern productions contain a better moral, [s]ince the whole merit of the filial obedience is cancelled by the retaining an affection for one man after they have vowed eternal fidelity to another. I would wi[s]h the authors of tho[s]e works to reflect, that it is the inclinations of the heart that renders us guilty as much as the actual commi[s][s]ion of a crime; and a woman who [s]trays from her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] husband only in wi[s]hes and thoughts, is in reality as culpable as [s]he who actually wounds his honor. I have very nice notions of conjugal fidelity and filial duty, and earne[s]tly wi[s]h that no writings might ever be made public which tend to injure either: they are the foundation on which we may always rai[s]e the temple of happine[s]s; they are a crown of glory for the head, a cordial and comforter even to the [s]orrow-wounded heart. The[s]e virtues are the brighte[s]t ornaments the female [s]ex can wear, they make the plaine[s]t woman lovely; and, when di[s]played in an eminent degree, elevate the human [s]oul, and make it little inferior to angels. I was proceeding in this manner, when a lovely young creature darted out of a little cottage, as we were pa[s][s]ing, and [s]eized me by the arm, eagerly de[s]ired I would convey her back to her friends. They [s]ay I am mad, [s]aid [s]he: but I am not, I have my rea[s]on as well as they have; I know I am mi[s]erable, and have been [s]o ever [s]ince they took my brother from me.---Oh! cruel to tear him from my arms, to break my very heart [s]trings, and [s]end him away, never, never to return---he went on the treacherous ocean---Yes, yes, the [s]ea, the [s]ky, all, all combined with my inhuman guardian to take him from me---hark! hark! do you not hear the wind?---See the blue lightning---the raging waves--- the thunder---I hear it---I [s]ee the ve[s][s]el beat the foaming [s]ea---I [s]ee my brother---[s]ee him wave his hand---I cannot come---I cannot [s]ave thee---the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] ve[s][s]el parts---[s]he [s]inks---he's gone, he's gone--- Oh! mercile[s]s.--- Alas! my drooping lily, [s]aid I, you [s]ee nothing; there is no [s]ea near you; this is merely the effect of fancy; your brother, no doubt, is [s]afe, and will one day return to make you happy. Oh no! [s]aid [s]he, cro[s][s]ing her hands upon her bo[s]om, and [s]itting down upon the ground.---Oh no! he will never return to me; he will never more [s]ooth and chear his unhappy [s]i[s]ter---but here will I [s]it on this lone bank and mourn the heavy hour in which he left me---I'll build a tomb of [s]ea [s]hells, weeds, and corals---I'll plant around it pale primro[s]es and [s]ickly daffodils, and every day I'll wa[s]h it with my tears, and count the hours, and chide dull lagging Time, till his [s]harp [s]cythe [s]hall cut life's fine-drawn thread, and I may lay me down and [s]leep with my dear Horace--- Horace! [s]aid I, looking more intently at her--- It was poor Julietta---then Vellum was a villain. At the name of Vellum [s]he [s]tarted from the ground, appeared terrified, looked wildly round her, and uttering a feint exclamation, ran ha[s]tily into the cottage. I bade the author a good night and followed her--- but an old woman, who I found was her only attendant, could give me no information concerning her; only that [s]he had lo[s]t her [s]en[s]es ever [s]ince the death of her brother, who was shipwrecked as he was going abroad to fini[s]h his education, and that [s]he had been [s]ent into the country in hopes that the air would be of [s]ervice to her. I found my heart [s]o deeply engaged by the miserable [s]ituation of this lovely orphan, that it was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] with difficulty I re[s]trained my tears when I pressed her cold hand and bade her good night. Though it was near three years [s]ince I had been a witne[s]s to the [s]orrow of Julietta, on the death of her father, yet the [s]cene [s]till remained [s]re[s]h in my memory---I remembered the doubts I then entertained of Vellum's integrity, and was determined immediately to return to town and [s]earch into the my[s]tery of Horace's death, and the [s]hocking privation of Julietta's [s]en[s]es. When I have once formed a re[s]olution, I am not long in putting it in execution. The morning after my arrival tn town, I determined to pay Mr. Vellum an invi[s]ible vi[s]it. As I was proceeding through a very public [s]treet, I [s]aw a [s]ervant, in livery, feeding a fine dog with bits of roa[s]t meat, which appeared perfectly fre[s]h and good.---A poor woman, who[s]e tattered garb [s]poke extremity of poverty, who[s]e emaciated frame [s]eemed tottering on the verge of eternity, and who[s]e head was [s]prinkled over with hoary fro[s]t, approached the man, and in the humble[s]t manner intreated him to let her pick up a little of the victuals which he had thrown to the animal--- only one bit, Sir, [s]aid [s]he, to [s]ave me from starving--- The [s]ervant was [s]ilent---[s]he took it for consent, and bent forward to pick up what the dog [s]eemed to refu[s]e. The [s]ervant, who, unmoved, had heard her request, no [s]ooner [s]aw her attempt to gather up the broken [s]craps, than he [s]tepped eagerly to hen, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] Inatched them from her, and with [s]acrilegious hand [s]truck the wretched mortal, who[s]e [s]ex, age, and poverty, [s]hould have kept her [s]acred from insult. Good Heavens! [s]aid I, that a man [s]hould [s]o far forgot him[s]elf.---What! mu[s]t the brute creation enjoy ea[s]e and plenty, while an unhappy human being wanders through the [s]treets peri[s]hing with hunger!---and what mu[s]t this poor woman [s]uffer at [s]eeing her[s]elf denied the fragments that are rejected by a brute? for the dog had ab[s]olutely left a large part of the food that had been given him. Who does that dog belong to? [s]aid I to the [s]ervant? Lord M---, [s]aid he. Lord M---, [s]aid I, at that in[s]tant recollecting the unhappy cottagers---then why not pay Lord M---a vi[s]it now, as well as at any other time; it will only defer my intended inquiry at Mr. Vellum's a few hours longer. It was no [s]ooner thought on than determined; and having inquired of the [s]ervant in which hou[s]e his Lord[s]hip re[s]ided, I put on my ring, a[s]cended the [s]teps, and patiently waited the opening of the door. I chose to make this vi[s]it invi[s]ible, that I might be the better able to judge of the [s]entiments and di[s]po[s]ition of his Lord[s]hip. Having got admittance into the hou[s]e unperceived, I followed a [s]ervant who was going up [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] [s]lairs with the breakfa[s]t apparatus, though it was then 1 o'clock. On entering a room, I [s]aw a woman in an elegant di[s]habille , lolling on a [s]opha, and turning over an enormous heap of complimentary cards---She was between forty and fifty---was finely formed, and had once been hand[s]ome, if one might judge from a regular [s]et of features; but at pre[s]ent her [s]kin was [s]hrivelled and yellow, her eyes [s]unk and languid. Thomas, [s]aid [s]he to the [s]ervant, is my Lord [s]tirring? Yes, my Lady. Go with my compliments, and I [s]hould be glad of his company to breakfa[s]t. In a few moments my Lord entered, threw himself into an ea[s]y chair, yawned, and drawled out the compliments of the morning. Where were you, my Lord, la[s]t night? I was quite [s]urpri[s]ed at not [s]eeing you at Lady Blackace's--- all the world was there. It is quite a bore , my Lady, to [s]ee a man and his wife at the [s]ame place. Very true, my Lord; but had your Lord[s]hip appeared I [s]hould certainly have been [s]o polite as to have made my exit.--- A propos , my Lord---I wonder what has become of that fond fool, Charles Howard, and how he and I [s]abella like matrimony with the [s]our [s]auce of poverty---Good God! continued [s]he, I wonder how any body can think of [s]wallowing that bitter pill without having it sufficiently gilded over. A [s]ervant entered, and announced Mr. Howard. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] Mr. Howard! cried my Lady, [s]taring up with a[s]toni[s]hment, [s]urely you mi[s]take; my brother has been dead above the[s]e [s]even years; and Charles cannot think of coming. The gentleman certainly [s]ent up the name of Howard, [s]aid the [s]ervant. He was bid to [s]hew him up. An elegant, elderly gentleman [s]oon entered the room, dre[s][s]ed in the military habit---he paid his re[s]pects politely to my Lord---advanced to the Lady with a look of tenderne[s]s, and embraced her. You are, no doubt, [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee me, [s]i[s]ter, [s]aid he, after having [s]uppo[s]ed me dead [s]o many years; but your [s]urpri[s]e will be converted into joy when I inform you during the la[s]t [s]even years of my ab[s]ence I have accumulated a large [s]ortune, and am now come to reclaim my [s]on, and return the kindne[s]s and genero[s]ity with which you stepped forward, and offered him your favour and protection during the time when my duty forced me to be ab[s]ent from my native country---You, my dear Lord and Lady M---, took my poor boy when he had no inheritance but poverty. During the time the old gentleman was delivering the[s]e words Lady M---'s countenance underwent [s]everal changes, and at la[s]t [s]ettled in a deadly pale---the fond father in[s]tantly [s]aw the change, and a[s]ked in a voice [s]carcely audible, whether his child was dead? No, Captain Howard, [s]aid my Lord, he is not dead, but he has behaved [s]o ill of late, that he has [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] entirely forfeited my favour; he has voluntarily absented him[s]elf from my hou[s]e; and to confe[s]s the truth, I have not [s]een him the[s]e [s]ix years, nor do I know where he is. And what has he done? a[s]ked the di[s]tracted father. He has behaved like a poor, mean [s]pirited wretch, [s]aid my Lady---he has degraded the family my marrying a low, vulgar creature, in direct opposition to the advice, nay ab[s]olute commands, of my Lord and my[s]elf. Upon my honor, Mr. Howard, [s]aid my Lord, I had contracted [s]uch an e[s]teem for the lad, that I had po[s]itively determined to adopt him; but on his ab[s]olutely per[s]i[s]ting in his de[s]ign of marrying the low creature my Lady mentions, I forbid him my hou[s]e:---I had no intention to adopt a beggar's brat. The conver[s]ation was now interrupted by a servant, who informed my Lady there was company in the drawing room---[s]he begged leave of her brother to go and receive them; and my Lord, having rung for his valet, retired to adju[s]t his dre[s]s. Captain Howard had been abruptly informed that his [s]on had forfeited his uncle's favour; had been informed of it in a manner incon[s]iderate and unfeeling, and then left to him[s]elf to reflect at leisure on his misfortune. He [s]at with one hand re[s]ting on the breakfa[s]t table, and the other in his bo[s]om, his brow contracted, and his eyes fixed on the floor---there was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] [s]uch a dignity in his per[s]on, and yet [s]uch an apparent concern upon his countenance, that my affections were drawn towards him by an irre[s]i[s]tible impulse--- I longed to call him brother and friend--- my heart was wrung with [s]en[s]ibility. And what avails it, [s]aid I, that this man has accumulated a large fortune?---of what benefit is wealth to him?---he had looked upon his [s]on as his greate[s]t trea[s]ure---for the[s]e many years has his delighted imagination drawn a mo[s]t perfect picture of felicity in the idea of beholding this beloved [s]on, and [s]eeing him enjoying the favour of his uncle, and perhaps wedded to [s]ome amiable woman, who, to the gifts of birth and fortune, added the gifts of nature, who[s]e beauty created love, and her virtue e[s]teem. Behold him now in one moment bereaved of this darling hope, his heart aching with paternal love and fear---oh! would children but reflect how greatly the happine[s]s of a parent depends on their well doing; could they have the lea[s]t idea of the mighty pangs which tear the parental bo[s]om when they [s]tray from their duty, they would [s]urely avoid every action which might tend to di[s]turb the peace or wound the minds of their parents; for [s]ure I am, that not the [s]harpe[s]t torture enthu[s]ia[s]tic zeal could invent, can equal the torments that rend the heart of a fondly-doating di[s]appointed parent. My meditations were interrupted by a decent, elderly woman, who opened the door, and, advancing to Captain Howard, welcomed him cordially to England. My good Mrs. Wat[s]on, [s]aid he, taking her by her hand, can you tell me where Charles is, and to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] whom he has united him[s]elf [s]o contrary to the desire of his uncle and aunt? It was for that purpo[s]e, [s]aid Mrs. Wat[s]on, that I took the liberty of coming into the room to [s]peak to you---but this room, Sir, is not a proper place to conver[s]e in; I mu[s]t beg you to come into my apartment, and I will then inform you of [s]ome circumstances which will fill you with a[s]toni[s]hment. I felt a curio[s]ity which I could not with[s]tand, and, anxious for the fate of Charles, I followed Captain Howard and Mrs. Wat[s]on into another apartment. Mrs. Wat[s]on I found was Lady M---'s hou[s]ekeeper, and had formerly lived in that capacity with her Lady[s]hip's mother---When Captain Howard was [s]eated, [s]he related the following circum[s]tances: You know, Sir, [s]aid [s]he, ju[s]t before you left England, my Lady, at my Lord's reque[s]t, had taken Mi[s]s I[s]abella Beauchamp to be her companion--- you had not been gone many years before Mr. Beauchamp died in[s]olvent, and the poor young Lady had no dependance but on my Lord, who was a di[s]tant relation of her father's. From the time of Mr. Beauchamp's death, Lady M--- altered in her behaviour to Mi[s]s Bella; treated her often with di[s]re[s]pect; and in general, with cold contempt--- My Lord, on the contrary, behaved with the greatest politene[s]s, affiduity, and attention; made her elegant pre[s]ents, in[s]i[s]ted on her joining all parties, public or private, in which Lady M--- was included--- young Mr. Howard [s]hewed the attention of a brother; and, I mu[s]t own, this conduct rai[s]ed both the gentlemen highly in my opinion. It was with great concern that I noticed a [s]ettled melancholy on Mi[s]s Bella's countenance, and often would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] [s]he retire from a crowded a[s][s]embly to her own apartment and give a loo[s]e to her tears---[s]he had always conducted her[s]elf in [s]uch a manner as to gain the love of all the dome[s]tics, and [s]he had favoured me with many [s]ingular marks of friend[s]hip---I therefore took the liberty one day to enquire into the cau[s]e of her melancholy; when bur[s]ting into a flood of grief, [s]he cried, oh! Mrs. Wat[s]on, what will become of me? Lord M--- pur[s]ues me with a criminal pa[s][s]ion---I cannot [s]tay in this family to be [s]ubject to his in[s]ults; and if I leave it, how [s]hall I guard my[s]elf from the [s]nares and in[s]ults of the unfeeling part of mankind, who know not how to pity poverty? or how [s]hall I provide for the necessaries of life? I endeavoured all in my power to console her, and told her I would certainly look out for [s]ome reputable family where [s]he might be boarded on moderate terms, and that I would advi[s]e her to [s]ell a few of her jewels to provide for the pre[s]ent, and tru[s]t in Providence that her future life may be more fortunate---[s]he gave me a pair of diamond earings, which were her mother's, to di[s]po[s]e of; but as I was returning to my own apartment I met Mr. Howard, and knowing he was always plentifully [s]upplied with money by his aunt, I determined to make him acquainted with Mi[s]s Bella's situation, and engage him to a[s][s]i[s]t her---but judge my [s]urpri[s]e, when I had informed him of my Lord's de[s]igns, to hear him fly into a violent rage, and [s]wear [s]he [s]hould not [s]tay another hour in the hou[s]e, called her his wife, his adored Bella, and was ha[s]tening to her apartment, when he was [s]topped by his aunt, who had overheard our conver[s]ation, and peremptorily demanded whether he had been [s]o mean [s]pirited as to marry Mi[s]s Beauchamp?--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] he an[s]wered with warmth, he was not married to her; but [s]ince there was no other way to [s]hield her from the contempt of pride and the in[s]ults of libertinism, he would marry her the next morning. Lady M--- was greatly irritated, and [s]ent a message to Mi[s]s Beauchamp, commanding her to quit her hou[s]e in[s]tantly---Charles followed the poor distressed girl; and before my Lord returned, who was then in the country, prevailed on her to give him a lawful right to protect her. However ill Mi[s]s Beauchamp had been treated, Mr. Howard thought it was his duty to vi[s]it his uncle, and [s]ue for his pardon, for the precipitate [s]tep he had taken. They made their appearance the morning after my Lord came to town---it is unnece[s][s]ary, and would only be [s]hocking your feelings, to give you an account of the reception they met with; [s]uffice it to [s]ay, they were [s]purned by the haughty pair, and turned with indignity out of the hou[s]e. Lord M--- [s]wearing by all that was holy he would not give them a [s]ingle farthing to keep them from [s]tarving---they left the hou[s]e, and I never heard where they were till la[s]t [s]ummer, when I accidentally found them in a mean cottage, which they rented of Lord M---'s [s]teward---they went by an a[s][s]umed name, and Mrs. Howard having bred very fa[s]t, and being very weakly, they were reduced to the mo[s]t abject [s]tate of penury. Then the[s]e are my poor cottagers, [s]aid I. \---Mr. Howard, when he had heard the conclusion of her relation, aro[s]e from his [s]eat and looking at once joy and indignation, [s]wore he would never re[s]t till he had found his dear injured Charles. I will find him, [s]aid he; and his lovely I[s]abella [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] [s]hall be rewarded for all her love and patient sufferings--- he gave the hou[s]ekeeper [s]omething by way of gratuity, and immediately departed---when I, having no farther bu[s]ine[s]s there, followed his example. It has often [s]urpri[s]ed me to find that people who have, with unbounded genero[s]ity, educated, cloathed, and fo[s]tered an infant in childhood, indulging it to an extravagant degree, never [s]uffering it to be contradicted, but bringing it up in ea[s]e aud luxury, [s]hall, when that infant arrives at years of maturity, when it has attained [s]en[s]e and rea[s]on [s]ufficient to enable it to judge what will mo[s]t conduce to its own happine[s]s, for the mo[s]t trifling mi[s]demeanor, nay, for only daring to think contrary to its benefactors, or pre[s]uming to choo[s]e a companion for it[s]elf, [s]purn from them, with indignity, the object they once cheri[s]hed, and drive it out defencele[s]s to brave tho[s]e [s]torms of adver[s]ity which the education they have be[s]towed on it renders it totally unable to combat with---it has often puzzled me to determine whether [s]uch people have ever been actuated by true genero[s]ity. Pure philanthropy will lead us rather to [s]tudy the happine[s]s of a human being, when it is capable of receiving real [s]atisfaction from our kindne[s]s. So far from evincing our affection to children by unlimited indulgencies, we are acting with cruelty toward them, [s]ince we are laying up a fund of di[s]content and unea[s]ine[s]s for hereafter. How hard is it for tho[s]e darlings of families, who[s]e every de[s]ire has been complied with, who never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] wi[s]hed for a toy or bauble but it was procured, though at the mo[s]t exorbitant price, who was always fed with the greate[s]t dainties, to find, when arrived at maturity, that they are journeying thro' a world where they will unavoidably meet with di[s]appointments, vexation, and trouble---for my part, I would never indulge my children in a wi[s]h which I thought might tend hereafter to render them unhappy; I would teach them to confine their de[s]ires within the bounds of moderation, not by moro[s]ely oppo[s]ing all their little fancies, but by in[s]en[s]ibly drawing off their attention to any other objects. As they advanced in years, I would, by example, teach them that forbearance and [s]elf-denial, which precept alone will ever fail to effect. If they have affluence, let them enjoy every rea[s]onable wi[s]h of their hearts; and no one need inquire what is to be done with the overplus. Oh! ye [s]ons and daughters of pro[s]perity, look around you; [s]ee, in you little man[s]ion lies a mother; a few hours [s]ince made her the parent of her [s]eventh child; [s]he is in a [s]ituation, of all others the mo[s]t de[s]erving pity; [s]he has [s]carcely the means to [s]upport life; [s]he is on a bed of pain and weakness; pain, my lovely country women, from which none of you are exempt, and which, no doubt, you think almo[s]t in[s]ufferable, though you are surrounded with all the comforts and ble[s][s]ings of life---that poor woman has no comfort---her hu[s]band is at [s]ea, labouring, watching, toiling for a [s]mall pittance, which he hopes to bring home to his wife and children---[s]he has angui[s]h of mind added to the [s]ickne[s]s of her frame---have you no trifle to [s]pare, Madam, which might, in [s]ome mea[s]ure, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] alleviate that poor creature's [s]ufferings? Two or three of tho[s]e guineas will never be mi[s][s]ed by you, and they will be a trea[s]ure to her.---You cannot [s]pare them---you had rather lay them out in an hobby hor[s]e for ma[s]ter, or a wax baby for mi[s]s---if the dear creatures are di[s]appointed, they will fret and [s]poil their pretty faces with crying; and what mother can refu[s]e her little darlings any thing they a[s]k for? Oh! [s]hame on thee, woman; thou ha[s]t not one [s]park of genuine maternal tenderne[s]s in thy composition, or thou woulde[s]t prefer ea[s]ing the pangs of a wretched mother who[s]e heart is pierced by the cries of her children wanting bread, rather than by gratifying the caprice of thy own children---lead them to [s]et no farther value on the wealth which Providence has entru[s]ted to their care, than as it may [s]erve to purcha[s]e plea[s]ure, di[s][s]ipation, and folly. Your wealth was certainly given you to purcha[s]e plea[s]ure; but plea[s]ures far, very far different from tho[s]e you are [s]o eager in the pur[s]uit of---Go wipe the tear from the eye of affliction; cloathe the poor naked wretch who, nightly unhou[s]ed in [s]ome [s]ad lonely place, braves [s]torms and tempe[s]ts, heats and pinching cold---go relea[s]e the unfortunate trade[s]man, who through the inattention, folly, or villainy of others, has lo[s]t his property, and now [s]ighs out his long, long hours in a pri[s]on---Go [s]eek the wretched mortals, who, by dire misfortune reduced, oppre[s][s]ed by the iron hand of affliction, [s]it [s]tarving in ob[s]curity, and, rather than a[s]k the cruel world for a[s][s]i[s]tance, or blazon forth their heart-felt [s]orrows, would [s]ink to the [s]ilent grave, victims to famine in the land of plenty.

Oh! I could tell [s]uch tales of woe, drag forth [s]uch vile ingratitude to light, that human nature would di[s]claim the being who could practi[s]e it. Do you [s]ee that beautiful woman in that splendid equipage, [s]urrounded by a train of [s]ervants? 'tis the thoughtle[s]s, ungrateful Amelia. Behold that poor old woman who toils through the dirt unattended by any but her two lovely daughters, [s]weet as opening flowers, and innocent as new-born infants; [s]ee on her venerable countenance what grief and de[s]pondency is imprinted! [s]ee the big tears roll down her [s]urrowed cheeks! [s]ee [s]he enters an ob[s]cure apartment, and a [s]canty meal is divided between her children and her[s]elf. She looks at them by turns with [s]uch maternal tenderne[s]s, [s]uch angui[s]h of heart, that [s]he [s]eems to [s]ay, what will become of you, my [s]weet children; how will you pa[s]s through life when I am gone. That poor old woman was Amelia's benefactress--- but it is fit I [s]hould tell my tale methodically. Amelia was the daughter of a gentleman of [s]mall fortune, who, be[s]ides her, had nine other children: Mrs. Ellwin was a di[s]tant relation of the family; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] [s]he was the wife of an opulent merchant, and their habitation was the habitation of philanthropy. Amelia had received a tolerable education---[s]he was pretty in her per[s]on, chearful in her disposition, and had a good [s]hare of under[s]tanding; with the[s]e accompli[s]hments, Mrs. Ellwin thought it would be a pity for Amelia to be buried in obscurity; [s]he gave her an invitation to her hou[s]e, cloathed her genteelly, and introduced her into [s]uch company as [s]he thought would be mo[s]t conducive to her future advancement in life. It was not long before Amelia's charms made a conque[s]t of a gentleman of large fortune---he loved her; and her virtues were [s]o kindly brought forward by Mrs. Ellwin, and her little faults buried in oblivion, that he overlooked her want of fortune, made her his wife, and [s]ettled upon her 5001. per annum jointure. Amelia had not long enjoyed this advancement, before Mr. Ellwin, having placed too great a dependance on the honor of a friend, lo[s]t a large [s]um of money; of con[s]equence his payments were not punctual, and he became a bankrupt. He [s]truggled for [s]ome time again[s]t his adver[s]e fate, but at length died of a broken heart, and left his wife and lovely daughters no inheritance but poverty. About this time Amelia became a widow:---but Amelia was now a fine lady---[s]he had no time to [s]pend with poor relations, no money to [s]pare to relieve the di[s]tre[s][s]es of Mrs. Ellwin; though her wedding cloaths were purcha[s]ed by that generous friend, and co[s]t near five hundred pounds, and that [s]um had never been repaid. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] Amelia is now ju[s]t married again, and flying about in all the gaiety of heart which wealth and [s]plendor can in[s]pire in a giddy mortal; while poor Mrs. Ellwin is [s]inking under a load of angui[s]h, unpitied and unthought of. Her once blooming, amiable daughters drooping like fro[s]t-nipped blossoms, and neither Friend[s]hip, Humanity, nor Gratitude will reach forth a hand to cheer, revive, or [s]ave them. But I am wandering from my intended route. As I approached Mr. Vellum's hou[s]e an hear[s]e and [s]ix mourning coaches drove from the door. Perhaps, [s]aid I, the guardian is gone to give an account of his guardian[s]hip---and a very black account I fear it will be---however I will go in; perhaps I may learn [s]omething concerning the death of Horace, or gain [s]ome intelligence which may be [s]erviceable to the haple[s]s Julietta. I put on my ring, and a [s]ervant opening the door [s]oon afterwards, I entered unperceived. I went into [s]everal rooms before I found any body likely to give me any [s]atisfaction by their conversation. At length I entered a chamber, where, on an embroidered [s]opha, lay Mr. Vellum, surrounded by magnificence---but, good Heavens! how changed from the man he once was---his face was gha[s]tly pale, his eyes [s]unk, yet their motion was [s]o quick and fiery that they gave him the appearance of a fiend rather than an human being. Oppo[s]ite to him, in a pen[s]ive po[s]ture, [s]at a young woman in a deep mourning habit; her face was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] partly concealed with her handkerchief, but the part that appeared bore [s]uch evident marks of sorrow, that a [s]avage mu[s]t have felt his heart moved with pity at the [s]ight. He is gone, gone for ever, cried Vellum, [s]tarting from the [s]opha, and catching hold of the young lady's hand---he is gone, He[s]ter, and you know not half the angui[s]h of my [s]oul. My dear father, [s]aid [s]he, why will you give way to unavailing [s]orrow? the kind Power who lent him to you has but re-called his own---it is the lot of mortality---then, why my father, why will you offend your Creator by repining at his divine will? O, He[s]ter, you do not know the dreadful circumstances of your brother's death---alas! my child, he ru[s]hed unbidden into the prefence of his Maker with multitudes of unrepented crimes upon his head. Did he de[s]troy him[s]elf? cried He[s]tor, the look of woe changing into that of inexpre[s][s]ible horror.--- Oh! what could tempt him to the dreadful deed? He[s]ter, my beloved daughter, I was his murderer, I was the cau[s]e of the horrid act. Forbid it, gracious God, [s]he cried, cla[s]ping her hands and [s]inking upon her knees---Oh! my father, recall tho[s]e [s]hocking words; you was not, could not be, [s]o inhuman. He[s]ter, [s]aid he, with a look of horrid firmne[s]s, I will unfold to you a tale which it is proper you [s]hould know; I may not long continue with you.--- I have been guilty of deeds which will make your tender heart [s]hudder to acknowledge me as a parent---Oh! cur[s]ed avarice, it was that which led me to [s]tain my [s]oul with murder, and to ruin my child, my darling [s]on.---For him and for thee [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] I would have gained an empire, though I had waded to it through oceans of human blood: but to lead him by vile per[s]ua[s]ions to agree to, and execute the accur[s]ed plot, and plunge him[s]elf, for [s]ordid ore, to the lowe[s]t aby[s]s of hell.---Oh! it is more than I can bear to think of---my [s]oul is at this moment [s]uffering all the tortures of the damned---[s]corpions, flames, and furies hang about me---Horace, dear murdered youth, well may you [s]mile to [s]ee my tortures. Was Horace murdered! Oh! inhuman wretch, cried He[s]ter---then where is my [s]weet Julietta? have you murdered her too? I hope [s]he [s]till lives, [s]aid Vellum; and may your gentle friend[s]hip recall her wandering rea[s]on, for my cruelty has bereaved her of her [s]en[s]es; and if [s]he is alive, [s]he is a poor, di[s]tre[s][s]ed lunatic. Gracious Heaven! cried He[s]ter, bur[s]ting into a flood of tears, and leaning her head upon the elbow of the [s]opha. The lovely girl, continued her father, is in a miserable cottage, on one of her own e[s]tates, in Wiltshire, where I have employed an old woman to watch her, and, by har[s]h treatment, prevent her returning to rea[s]on. As to Horace he is no more.---When I [s]ent him abroad, as I [s]aid, for education, your brother went with him---we laid the [s]hocking plot before the ve[s][s]el [s]ailed; and one night as they were walking the deck together, your brother pu[s]hed Horace into the [s]ea---the ve[s][s]el was [s]ailing before the wind, and he was lo[s]t in a moment. You, my dear He[s]ter, I knew would be an obstacle to the[s]e helli[s]h [s]chemes, and for that rea[s]on I [s]ent you to France.---About three weeks [s]ince your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] brother had a thou[s]and pounds of me; and in a few days after, applied for more; it was then I discovered he had a propen[s]ity for gaming---I remonstrated with him on the folly of [s]uch a pur[s]uit, and refu[s]ed him a [s]upply---high words en[s]ued---he accused me of being a murderer; of drawing him in to participate the crime, and then refu[s]ing him a participation of the wealth I had by that means gained.---It is impo[s][s]ible for you to conceive the terrors that [s]eized my mind during this conversation; I actually formed the re[s]olution of giving this darling of my [s]oul into the hands of ju[s]tice, and thereby [s]aving my own wretched life---but before I could execute my intention, I was alarmed by the di[s]charge of a pi[s]tol---I ran to your brother's room, and [s]aw him weltering in his blood, a pi[s]tol clenched in his hand. Go, leave me, [s]aid he, as I approached him; add not, by thy hateful pre[s]ence, to the horror of this moment---I thought, by dying, to [s]hut out life and mi[s]ery together, to fly from the terrors of a reproaching con[s]cience; but, alas! my mi[s]eries are but ju[s]t beginning. Oh! thou dete[s]ted, wretched old man, continued he, drawing me forcibly towards him, thou art ignorant what a ta[s]k thou ha[s]t yet to perform: Go, lo[s]e not a moment, but u[s]e every method to re[s]tore that injured angel Julietta to her [s]en[s]es---give her back her fortune---and do thou retire to [s]ome desert--- fa[s]t, pray, and lay upon the cold ground--- years and years [s]pent in [s]upplication will hardly gain that pardon you [s]o much need.---There is! there is! an hereafter---I feel it now ru[s]h on my guilty [s]oul.---You do not know how hard it is to die, to plunge at once into eternity.---Oh! murder, murder cannot be forgiven. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] At that in[s]tant he expired with a groan, [s]o hollow, that it [s]till vibrates in my ears. I hear thee, Oh! thou guilty [s]hade---I will obey thee. He[s]ter, continued Vellum, I have [s]ent for you home, that you may admini[s]ter comfort to Julietta--- here, take this paper, and go prepare for your journey; when you are [s]eparated from me, open it; you will there find full in[s]tructions how to act--- leave me, my child; I am now more compo[s]ed, I may perhaps take [s]ome re[s]t. He[s]ter gladly retired. I [s]aw from the agitation of her features, though [s]he could not but pity the di[s]tre[s][s]es of her father's mind, it was impo[s][s]ible for her any longer to love him. That ta[s]k is over, [s]aid Vellum, as [s]he [s]hut the door---now, what remains?---to pray for pardon.--- Pardon for what?---Murder. Ah! that is not all; my [s]oul is loaded with crimes.---Fraud, perjury, oppre[s][s]ion, are in the horrid catalogue!---the widows, the fatherle[s]s children whom I have oppressed, will ri[s]e up in judgment again[s]t me.---Mercy--- Oh! mercy ju[s]t God!---but wretch that I am, did I ever [s]hew mercy---will that ju[s]t Creator then [s]hew mercy to me?---No---for I mu[s]t appear at a tribunal where every one will be rewarded according to his works. Oh that I was annihilated!---that I had never lived---for the di[s]traction of my mind is too mighty to be borne---I will not bear it---I will end my tortures---my life is in my own power; and it is but to plunge at once into evils which cannot be more dreadful than this con[s]tant terror.---This is the in[s]trument, [s]aid he, taking a pi[s]tol from his pocket. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] I [s]tepped forward, in order to prevent his fatal intention. It [s]hall be done quick, [s]aid he---I will not languish--- I caught hold of his arm; but it was too late; he had pointed the pi[s]tol to his temple---it went off, and he plunged in one moment into a dreadful eternity. Oh! [s]ave him! [s]ave him! cried He[s]ter, bursting into the room; he is not fit to die. When [s]he [s]aw the [s]hocking cata[s]trophe, [s]he uttered a [s]cream of terror, and [s]unk down upon the floor---the [s]ervants entered, and all was in an instant a [s]cene of confu[s]ion. I thought I could gain no farther intelligence--- and my [s]pirits being greatly depre[s][s]ed by the occurrences of the day, I departed, determining in a few days to pay the gentle, unfortunate He[s]ter another vi[s]it. I wish to go to Mrs. Melbourne's a[s][s]embly, next week, if agreeable to you, my dear, [s]aid a woman, who was walking through the park with a man who[s]e appearance [s]poke him the gentleman. She was a pretty-looking per[s]on; her countenance was open and engaging, and there was a mild air of tender melancholy diffu[s]ed over it. She led by the hand a beautiful girl, about four or five years old; and a [s]miling boy, [s]eemingly a year or two older, was [s]kipping, with [s]teps as light as his own innocent heart, before them ---that man, [s]aid I, mu[s]t [s]urely be happy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] I examined his countenance with a [s]crutinizing eye, and methought I read in it indifference and inattention; nay, he even [s]eemed unea[s]y in the company of his wife and lovely children. \---I [s]hould like to go to Mrs. Melbourne's assembly, [s]aid [s]he, putting her hand under his arm, and giving him a look of tenderne[s]s---it was a look I know not well how to de[s]cribe; it was a mixture of affection and gentle [s]olicitude; it was that kind of look my Emma ever a[s][s]umes when [s]he has any little favour to a[s]k, and it always carries with it [s]uch per[s]ua[s]ive eloquence, that for my [s]oul I could not refu[s]e, though [s]he were to reque[s]t the half of my fortune. You want new cloaths too, I [s]uppo[s]e, [s]aid he, rather [s]urlily. I thought you might make it convenient to let me have my half-years [s]tipend, [s]aid [s]he, mildly; and you know, my dear, I never exceed it. Very well, Madam, I hear enough of your oeconomy, [s]aid he, withdrawing his arm in anger; but I tell you I have no money for my[s]elf, and therefore cannot let you have any.---I do not [s]ee why you [s]hould go to Mrs. Melbourne's; you may find employment and amu[s]ement too in nur[s]ing your brats; home is the fitte[s]t place for women. I will not go, Mr. Selby, if you de[s]ire I [s]hould not. There, now, make a merit of [s]taying at home to oblige me, when you cannot go becau[s]e I will not give you money to lavi[s]h in finery. The education of your children co[s]ts me [s]o much that I intend for the future to reduce your allowance to half what it u[s]ed to be. Very well, my dear, you are the be[s]t judge of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] what you can afford; I [s]hall always have your interest too much at heart to repine at being deprived of a few [s]uperfluities which I can ea[s]ily do without. By this time they were arrived at Spring Gardens, where an hand[s]ome chariot was waiting. I am engaged out this evening, [s]aid he, handing her into the carriage. Shall I [s]ee you at [s]upper? [s]aid [s]he, again assuming the look of [s]olicitude; but it was far more anxious than the former. No---perhaps I [s]hall not return all night, [s]aid he; and immediately left her without even the common form of civility. Drive on, [s]aid [s]he, to the coachman; and as the carriage moved, I [s]aw her apply her handkerchief to her eyes. Poor woman! [s]aid I; at that in[s]tant feeling the drop of pity [s]tart into my own.---Poor woman! thou art [s]urrounded with wealth, have a number of [s]ervants, and, no doubt, for the[s]e advantages, are the object of envy in the eyes of many; but, alas! the poor cottager, who[s]e man[s]ion appears the habitation of poverty, who has ju[s]t [s]et by her wheel, and is feeding a number of cherry-cheeked, curlypated, ragged children, who[s]e hu[s]band, returning from the labours of the field, acco[s]ts her with words of kindne[s]s, ki[s][s]es all his little prattlers round, and takes the younge[s]t on his knee to [s]hare his homely [s]upper, that humble cottager is happier far than you. The[s]e reflections had pa[s][s]ed with [s]uch rapidity through my brain, that Mr. Selby was [s]till in [s]ight.--- I will follow thee, [s]aid I, and [s]ee what has had power to charm thee from [s]o [s]weet, [s]o gentle a companion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] Having got my ring on, I quickened my pace, and [s]oon overtook him. He proceeded to May Fair; when knocking at the door of a large hou[s]e, a [s]ervant in a [s]howey livery opened it; when, taking the advantage of my invi[s]ibility, I entered, and followed him through a magnificent [s]uite of rooms into a drawing room. She was an elegant-formed woman, rather above the middle [s]ize; her features were regular, and her complexion would have been dazzling, had it not been for an immoderate quantity of rouge which [s]he had laid on her face, which, in reality, required no art to make it lovely; her eyes were dark, lively, and piercing; and her hair, which was bright as golden thread, hung in wanton ringlets round her face and neck; her dre[s]s was [s]tudiedly negligent, being only a white mu[s]lin robe with [s]mall [s]ilver [s]prigs; it was fa[s]tened round her slender wai[s]t with a velvet zone, ornamented with pearl; [s]he was [s]eated by a table on which [s]at a little French dog, which [s]he was care[s][s]ing as we entered. My charming La[s][s]onia, [s]aid he, running to her with eagerne[s]s, how tedious have the hours pa[s][s]ed that kept me from you! No doubt they have, [s]aid [s]he, coldly evading his offered embrace; when you have made it two hours later than you promi[s]ed. My deare[s]t love, I could not avoid it, [s]aid he, bu[s]ine[s]s of importance--- Oh you are a very prudent man, [s]aid [s]he; scornfully; by all means bu[s]ine[s]s [s]hould be attended to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] before plea[s]ure; but it is very well, Mr. Selby. I have waited at home to hear your paltry excu[s]e for breaking your word; but I have made an engagement which I cannot po[s][s]ibly break; my chair is waiting:--- She aro[s]e to leave the room. My Angel, my dear La[s][s]onia, [s]aid he, catching her hands, you [s]urely do not mean to leave me; hear me but one word; I [s]hould have been here much [s]ooner had I not overtaken my wife and children in the park, and [s]he begun teazing me for money. And you gave it her? [s]aid [s]he, with precipitation. No, my charmer, I have not given it to her, I have re[s]erved it for you; there is not a wi[s]h my La[s][s]onia can form but [s]hall be immediately complied with---Emily had [s]et her heart upon going to Mrs. Melbourne's a[s][s]embly; but I knew my adored girl intended to be there, and did not wi[s]h to meet her; [s]o I have de[s]ired her not to go. And have you brought me your wife's diamonds? [s]aid [s]he. No ---but you [s]hall have [s]ome, more valuable than tho[s]e---we will go out now, and you [s]hall chu[s]e them at any price you plea[s]e. What, I [s]uppo[s]e, [s]aid [s]he, with a look of contempt, your wife refu[s]ed to part with them; and you, a poor, tame-[s]pirited hu[s]band, dared not contradict her; but I will have her jewels or none, [s]o take your choice, Sir, either bring me the meek, dutiful Emily's diamonds, or never [s]ee me more. What a pity it is, [s]aid I, as I [s]tood contemplating this [s]cene, what a pity [s]o lovely a form [s]hould conceal [s]o vile a heart; that woman appears a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] masterpiece of nature, and yet draw a[s]ide that beauteous veil, and there is [s]uch [s]oul deformity within, that we [s]hrink with horror and di[s]gu[s]t from the very object which at fir[s]t view filled us with admiration. I am unwilling to refu[s]e you any thing, my [s]weet girl, [s]aid he; but indeed I do not know how to get the jewels; I have no plau[s]ible pretext to a[s]k for them. And is this your boa[s]ted love? [s]aid [s]he, this the fidelity, the [s]ervent pa[s][s]ion you have [s]o repeatedly [s]worn? am I to be denied [s]o trifling a gratification becau[s]e you cannot bear a few tears from that proud minx your wife? have I not [s]acrificed every thing for you? relinqui[s]hed reputation, honor, friends; and is this the return? this the gratitude I am to meet with? you would [s]ooner break my heart than comply with the [s]malle[s]t of my wi[s]hes. During the[s]e reproaches [s]he had vented her passion by tears. Do not thus di[s]tre[s]s your[s]elf, my deare[s]t creature, [s]aid Selby; you cut me to the [s]oul by your reproaches; come, dry up your tears, and tell me in what can I oblige you? Go and bring me Emily's diamonds this evening, [s]aid [s]he. I came to [s]pend the night with you, my love, then do not [s]end me from you; let us go out and purcha[s]e [s]ome other trinkets. I will have nothing but the diamonds! exclaimed [s]he, in an agony of pa[s][s]ion; which reminded me of Othello in his jealous fury raving for the fatal handkerchief. At length the infatuated Selby, finding it was in vain to attempt to [s]ooth her, and being, as he [s]aid, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] unable to live without her, actually promi[s]ed to go home and fetch the jewels for which [s]he expre[s][s]ed [s]uch a de[s]ire. I was determined to go with him, and ha[s]tily [s]tepping down [s]tairs before him, [s]tepped unperceived into a hackney coach which he had [s]ent for, and was waiting for him at the door---a [s]hort time brought us to Gower [s]treet. This is kind indeed, my love, [s]aid Mrs. Selby, meeting him with a [s]mile as he entered the parlour; I was afraid you would not have returned [s]o [s]oon. P[s]haw, [s]aid he, throwing him[s]elf into a chair; I do not [s]uppo[s]e you will be [s]o plea[s]ed when I tell you the bu[s]ine[s]s which brought me home. If it is any thing which will make you unea[s]y, my dear, [s]aid [s]he, I [s]hall certainly regret it; but if it only concerns my[s]elf I [s]hall regret nothing which gives me the extatic plea[s]ure of your company. You are a good girl, Emily, [s]aid he, taking her hand---and methought at that in[s]tant he repented the ta[s]k he had undertaken---but it was a momentary reflection. I have occa[s]ion for a large [s]um of money, [s]aid he, to make up a payment, and I have no po[s][s]ible means of rai[s]ing it. Good God! cried [s]he, turning pale with apprehension, are your circum[s]tances really [s]o bad then? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] Make no inquiries, [s]aid he, but con[s]ider if you can form any plan to relieve me. How much do you want my love? About two thou[s]and pounds. I dare [s]ay my father will lend you [s]uch a trifle, rather than you [s]hould be di[s]tre[s][s]ed. So, Madam, [s]aid he, you would advi[s]e me to apply to your father, and make my misfortunes the talk of the town.---You [s]ay you love me, Emily. Heaven knows I do mo[s]t [s]ervently. Then to prove it, bring me your jewels, they will procure me the money I want. You cannot rai[s]e [s]o large a [s]um without my mother's al[s]o; and I [s]hould not wi[s]h to part with them. A very pretty declaration indeed, Madam; you value your mother's memory more than your husband's peace of mind. Oh! do not [s]ay [s]o har[s]h a word, [s]aid [s]he; I will bring the jewels---had I the univer[s]e at my command it would be of no value to me when put in competition with your happine[s]s. She left the room, and [s]oon returned with the jewels. Here they are, [s]aid [s]he; would to Heaven every de[s]ire which you form may be as ea[s]ily obtained. He looked them over. The[s]e are not all, [s]aid he--- A blu[s]h of confu[s]ion pa[s][s]ed over the pale face of the trembling Emily. I have indeed re[s]erved [s]ome, [s]aid [s]he; but do not be angry, I cannot part with the fir[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] tokens of your love; I cannot part with your picture. I mu[s]t have all, [s]aid he, impatiently. The afflicted wife drew from her throbbing bosom a miniature picture [s]et with diamonds, and a [s]mall, but valuable locket, emblamatical of love and peace; he took them from her--- Leave me the picture, [s]aid [s]he---take the diamonds; but, for pity's [s]ake, take not that dear, fir[s]t pledge of your love.---The picture will not enhance the value to any but me. I cannot [s]tay to take it out, [s]aid he, putting the jewels into his pocket, and giving the poor, weeping Emily a [s]light ki[s]s; he [s]natched up his hat and in[s]tantly returned to the vile La[s][s]onia. I had been too much di[s]gu[s]ted with that woman's behaviour to entertain a thought of returning with him, therefore, taking off my ring, when I left the hou[s]e, I walked toward home. Being at the play with a friend [s]ome months after, I ob[s]erved La[s][s]onia in a box oppo[s]ite to that in which I [s]at, adorned with the very jewels which Selby had obtained from his affectionate wife. Who that [s]ees that woman, [s]aid I to my friend, but would think her the lovelie[s]t work of creation. I have been admiring her for [s]ome time, [s]aid he; can you give me any information concerning her? I have [s]een her once before, and am quite captivated with her beauty; if her mind is equal to her per[s]on, I could freely devote my life to [s]uch a woman. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] There is no more compari[s]on between her mind and her form, [s]aid an old gentleman, in a black coat and a [s]nug round wig, who [s]at ju[s]t behind us--- there is no more compari[s]on between them, [s]aid he, than there is between an angel of Light and a dae mon of Hell. Do you know her, Sir, [s]aid my friend, turning ha[s]tily round. I do, young man, [s]aid he; and to guard you from the effects of her pernicious charms, if you will [s]up with me after the play, I will tell you a tale that [s]hall make you hate her. When the play was over we adjourned to a tavern, and after [s]upper our new friend gave us the hi[s]tory of La[s][s]onia. Mi[s]s Freeman and Mi[s]s Eldridge, [s]aid, he, were the daughters of two opulent trade[s]men; their fathers were united in the clo[s]e[s]t bonds of amity. Emily Freeman and La[s][s]onia Eldridge were playmates in infancy, educated at the [s]ame [s]chool, and contracted for each other the affection of [s]i[s]ter. --- Emily had ju[s]t entered her [s]ixteenth year, when [s]he was called from [s]chool to attend an excellent mother, who was ha[s]tily advancing to that "bourne from whence no traveller returns." La[s][s]onia would not be [s]eparated from her friend on this trying occasion, and Mrs. Freeman [s]oon after paying the debt of nature, [s]he was retained by Mr. Freeman as a companion, who[s]e vivacity would prevent Emily from too frequently mu[s]ing on her recent lo[s]s. Mr. Selby became acquainted with the lovely friends before Emily had attained her eighteenth year---her [s]en[s]e and penetration charmed him; and her per[s]on, having then all the attractions of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] blooming youth, he declared him[s]elf her lover---he frequently laughed and romped with La[s][s]onia, but never entertained a thought of love, as her conduct in general was [s]o [s]lighty, and her conver[s]ation [s]o trifling, that though it was impo[s][s]ible to avoid admiring her beauty, [s]he had not one requi[s]ite calculation to create e[s]teem. About this time Mr. Eldridge was taken ill--- the phy[s]icians feared a con[s]umption, and advi[s]ed a journey to Montpelier---La[s][s]onia accompanied her father, and during their ab[s]ence Emily gave her hand to Mr. Selby. Mr. Eldridge recovered his health, and they revi[s]ited England; when, no mention being made of La[s][s]onia's returning to Mrs. Selby, [s]he continued with her father to [s]uperintend his family. Two years pa[s][s]ed on in delightful harmony between Mr. and Mrs. Selby, in which time [s]he pre[s]ented him with a boy and a girl. During that period the father of La[s][s]onia died insolvent, and [s]he was reduced to the nece[s][s]ity of going to [s]ervice, as there was not the lea[s]t provi[s]ion for her future [s]ub[s]i[s]tence. It was then the generous, di[s]intere[s]ted Emily offered her an a[s]ylum in her hou[s]e, appointed her an apartment, a [s]ervant to attend her, and [s]upplied her with cloaths and money from her own private pur[s]e. La[s][s]onia had not long been an inmate in the hou[s]e of her friend, before, envious of her felicity, [s]he determined to imbitter it by alienating the affection of Selby from his truly amiable wife---Selby was young, and fond of variety; his pa[s][s]ion for Emily was greatly abated by po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and though he almo[s]t venerated her for her virtues, the charms of her faithle[s]s friend enflamed his heart, and he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] eagerly caught at the frequent opportunities which [s]he intentionally gave him to plead his pa[s][s]ion. La[s][s]onia is a proud woman; her [s]ituation was irk[s]ome, though every favour from Emily was conferred in [s]o delicate a manner that an indifferent [s]pectator would have imagined her the per[s]on obliged. She was likewi[s]e an artful woman; [s]he [s]oon gained [s]uch an a[s]cendancy over Selby, that while Emily [s]carcely dared to hint her wi[s]hes, La[s][s]onia demanded with authority, and gained every de[s]ire. Yet of [s]o gentle, un[s]u[s]picious, a temper was Mrs. Selby, and [s]o great a confidence did [s]he place in the honor of her friend and her hu[s]band, that though La[s][s]onia remained in the family near a twelve-month after her connection with Selby, [s]he never once thought [s]uch a thing could happen. She frequently lamented to her treacherous friend the alteration in her hu[s]band's behaviour, but [s]he never [s]u[s]pected her as the cau[s]e of her unea[s]ine[s]s. But La[s][s]onia now found it nece[s][s]ary to remove from Mrs. Selby's, to prevent her [s]hame from becoming public; [s]he told Emily that [s]he was distressed at being [s]o great an incumbrance to her, and that having an opportunity of going abroad with a lady, who wanted a companion, [s]he would embrace it, and endeavour to contribute to her own [s]upport. By this conduct [s]he laid a plan to prevent returning to the family, which [s]he predetermined not to do before [s]he left it. Mrs. Selby loaded her with obligations at parting. She retired to a [s]mall hou[s]e about twenty miles from town which Selby had provided for her reception, and where [s]he remained three years, Selby [s]pending great part of his time with her. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] About [s]ix months [s]ince [s]he came to town, assumed the name of Green, took an elegant hou[s]e, and [s]et up a carriage. Mrs. Selby hearing of her arrival, and [s]uppo[s]ing [s]he was married, reque[s]ted me, who at that time was ignorant of the circumstances I have now related, to go with her and pay La[s][s]onia a morning vi[s]it. We were [s]hewn into the drawing room by a [s]ervant, who informed us his mi[s]ter[s]s would be down in a few minutes, but that [s]he was then dressing. How agreeably [s]urpri[s]ed my dear La[s][s]onia will be, [s]aid Emily, to find I am the lady who wanted to [s]peak with her---for [s]he had [s]ent up no name. We were chatting on indifferent [s]ubjects, when a child ran into the room, crying, I will have papa's picture; I won't break it indeed; a maid following him in; he ran to Emily, who[s]e arms were extended to receive him, and throwing the picture into her lap, judge her feelings when [s]he [s]aw the portrait of Mr. Selby, which [s]he had given him but two days before with the greate[s]t regret, imagining him in want of money. Her feelings over-powered her, and [s]he fell lifele[s]s on the floor. The cries of the [s]ervant alarmed the family, and Lassonia, thinking [s]ome misfortune had happened to her child, ru[s]hed into the room followed by Selby him[s]elf. It is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe the [s]cene that en[s]ued on the recovery of Emily---La[s][s]onia raved, Mrs. Selby wept, and Selby appeared motionle[s]s as a [s]tatue. As [s]oon as Emily was able to walk, I took her hand and led her to the carriage. Upon her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] return home, her fainting fits returned; [s]he pa[s][s]ed a night of inconceivable di[s]tre[s]s, for Selby never came near her; and in the morning [s]he was in a violent fever. I then went in pur[s]uit of the perfidious hu[s]band; but as the [s]uffering faint de[s]ired, forbore to reproach him. I found him, and he returned with me to her. She beheld him approach with a faint [s]mile---It is kind, my Selby, [s]aid [s]he, to come and receive the parting [s]igh of her who has [s]o long been a barrier to your happine[s]s; indeed I did not know, or I never would have vi[s]ited my happy rival---I never thought your love was divided, and the certainty of it came [s]o [s]udden upon my heart, that weak and unprepared as it was, it could not bear the [s]hock---take care of my children, [s]aid [s]he, adieu my love; my heart may break, but my tongue will never reproach you. Her di[s]order hourly increa[s]ed; a delirium ensued; and before the next morning [s]he breathed her la[s]t, invoking ble[s][s]ings on the head of her faithle[s]s hu[s]band and treacherous friend. It is [s]uch women as La[s][s]onia who ca[s]t an odium on the whole [s]ex; and [s]uch women are not only objects of contempt but dete[s]tation. I am not of opinion that women would never degenerate into vice, were they not at fir[s]t [s]educed by man; certain I am, though my heart achs at the idea, that there are many women who are abandoned to all manner of wickedne[s]s entirely through [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] the depravity of their inclinations.---Oh! how my [s]oul ri[s]es with indignation to [s]ee the faire[s]t works of the Creator's hand [s]o far forget their native dignity as to glory in actions which deba[s]e them beneath the lowe[s]t reptile that crawls upon the earth! To [s]ee a woman loaded with ornaments which are the wages of guilt, and exulting in the badges of her di[s]honor; to [s]ee her admitted into all public places, and rudely pre[s][s]ing before the meek and virtuous---I could [s]trip her of her gaudy trappings, and, to bring her to a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of her infamous conduct, feed her upon bread and water, till convinced of the nece[s][s]ity of repentance, [s]he [s]hould gladly embrace the mo[s]t [s]ervile employment, and accept the meane[s]t apparel, rather than return to her former life of vice and di[s][s]ipation. How many families have been ruined by licentious women! How many virtuous wives have [s]unk, broken-hearted to the grave! how many innocent orphans have been [s]ent portionle[s]s into the world, through their diabolical machinations! and, alas! (I [s]hudder as the thought occurs) how many wretched women, forgetful of their marriage vows, have relinqui[s]hed a tender hu[s]band, a family of children, who[s]e innocent care[s][s]es [s]hould have linked her heart in[s]eparably to their father, and thrown her[s]elf into the arms of an abandoned libertine!--- let not [s]uch a woman plead [s]eduction---a married woman mu[s]t, by her conduct give [s]ome encouragement before the mo[s]t profligate man would dare offend her ear with a declaration of love; and weak, very weak, mu[s]t be her repul[s]es, if he ventures to per[s]evere in his impious pur[s]uit. From the inmo[s]t rece[s][s]es of my [s]oul do I pity the unhappy girl who, betrayed by the impul[s]e of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] affection, falls a prey to an in[s]idious villain, and, abandoned by her [s]educer, is expo[s]ed to the [s]corn and contempt of the world---Oh! how my heart has been wrung to [s]ee poor girls who are [s]carcely pa[s]t their childhood, who[s]e misfortune it has been to have wicked advi[s]ers, [s]o early initiated into the [s]chool of vice. Their tender frames, which once perhaps, by kind, paternal care, were [s]hielded from the winds of Heaven---now defencele[s]s, in the mo[s]t inclement [s]ea[s]on expo[s]ed to noxious damps and pinching cold, and when they mo[s]t [s]tand in need of con[s]olation, when bowed almo[s]t to the grave with want, di[s]ea[s]e, and [s]hame, to [s]ee them re[s]t their wearied bones upon the cold damp pavement, and lay their aching heads upon the [s]teps of an hou[s]e where a woman dwells, who[s]e heart is a thou[s]and times more guilty than theirs, who [s]ins without remor[s]e, and riots in wealth and luxury. I never [s]ee the poor nightly wanderers that infest our [s]treets, but, [s]pite of my endeavours to the contrary, the tear of angui[s]h will [s]teal unbidden to my eye. Poor [s]ouls! I often [s]ay, poor unhappy creatures, would to Heaven I had a fortune capacious as my heart, that I might [s]natch you from perdition, and teach you the road to everla[s]ting felicity. I would guard you from the in[s]ults of the world; I would cheri[s]h you, li[s]ten to all your tales of [s]orrow, and join my tears with yours, till we had wa[s]hed away the [s]tains of guilt, and taught you "that to be happy, is to be happy." Oh! my fair countrywomen, turn not away from the plaints of mi[s]ery; [s]corn not the daughters of affliction; for, if by clemency and humanity you could draw one mi[s]erable object from the thorny [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] paths of vice, and re[s]tore her to peace with her own [s]oul, you would do an act more acceptable in the [s]ight of your Creator, than the man who be[s]tows thou[s]ands for the endowment of an ho[s]pital---the fir[s]t action mu[s]t proceed from innate goodne[s]s of the heart; the la[s]t may from [s]elf-love---a man may do a public act of benevolence to perpetuate his name, and dignify him[s]elf with the title of generous; but that pure charity which leads us to forgive the [s]ailing of our fellow creatures, chear the de[s]ponding heart, and wipe the grief-[s]woln eye of an ob[s]cure individual, mu[s]t be the re[s]ult of religion; it is a [s]ort of benevolence which gratifies the heart in performing good deeds, but blu[s]hes whenever tho[s]e actions are repeated---It feels the mo[s]t exalted plea[s]ure in relieving a di[s]tre[s][s]ed fellow creature, but it is pained to receive acknowledgements. I WILL go and pay the di[s]con[s]olate He[s]ter a visit, [s]aid I, one morning as I was rambling near Chel[s]ea. I bent my [s]teps toward her habitation; but had not proceeded far before I ob[s]erved a young man, who[s]e dre[s]s had formerly been genteel, but was now [s]habby in the extreme; his hair had once been dre[s][s]ed, but it might have been [s]ome three weeks or a month [s]ince; his coat was de couleur de puce  , but much the wor[s]e for wear, as the elbows di[s]covered a very fine, but dirty, [s]hirt; his once [s]atin wai[s]tcoat was threadbare and grea[s]y, his breeches loo[s]e and ragged at the knees; a pair of dirty [s]ilk [s]tockings, ornamented with here and there [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] a hole, hung in a [s]lovenly manner about his legs; and the [s]able fril of his [s]hirt, that peeped from his brea[s]t, was trimmed with the fine[s]t edging---That man has once been a coxcomb, [s]aid; for I always judge when I [s]ee the remains of finery put on carele[s]sly or disfigured with dirt, that the wearer has formerly been extravagant in his dre[s]s. I approached the tattered beau in order to take a view of his per[s]on, when I di[s]covered the features of my old acquaintance Mr. Woudbe. And this is the end of ignorant pride, ostentation, and folly, [s]aid I---no doubt you would now be glad of a friend to admini[s]ter to tho[s]e wants which henceforth you will learn to pity in others---but I fear your conduct has been [s]uch that you have no friends to apply to. The thought was [s]carcely pa[s][s]ed before two disagreeable looking fellows came up, and [s]hewing the trembling Woudbe a bit of parchment, he was forced to [s]urrender him[s]elf their pri[s]oner. Ju[s]t at that time a young man of fa[s]hion pa[s][s]ing, and recollecting Woudbe, acco[s]ted him with heigh! Jack, what! come to this already! I thought you would have held it out a little longer---ha! ha! what a rueful figure!---all out at the elbows eh! A truce with your [s]neers, Sir, [s]aid Woudbe, assuming an air of importance, I [s]tand in need of twenty pounds immediately---you have frequently made me offers of [s]ervice; lend me that [s]um, and I [s]hall be obliged to you. Ah! Jack, [s]aid the other, that air and manner won't do now, it did very well while the l'argent la[s]ted, and you was a gentleman at large; but now you are again plain Jack Woudbe, the Cabinet-maker; you mu[s]t learn to bow, cringe, and mind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] your bu[s]ine[s]s---I am [s]orry it goes [s]o hard with you; but depend upon it, this will always be the ca[s]e with young men of trifling fortunes, who ape the manners, and launch into extravagancies, which are only becoming their [s]uperiors---I would lend you the money with all my heart, but I know you have no way to repay it, and are too proud to go to work; therefore you had better [s]ubmit to your fate with a good grace. The poor cre[s]t fallen Woudbe walked away with his di[s]agreeable companions, and the [s]tranger addressed him[s]elf to me---that young man, Sir, [s]aid he, was the [s]on of an indu[s]trious trade[s]man, who by [s]trict attention to bu[s]ine[s]s, [s]craped together about three or four thou[s]and pounds; at his death this money was left for his only [s]on, who was then getting a little education at a cheap [s]chool in the country. When fifteen years old, he was apprenticed to a capital Cabinet-maker; a very hand[s]ome premium was given with him; but he was too much of the gentleman to attend to bu[s]ine[s]s, and when he came of age he a[s][s]umed the dre[s]s and manners of a man of fa[s]hion; expen[s]ive amu[s]ements, treats, balls, and the retinue of di[s][s]ipation and folly were eagerly attended to---but this would not la[s]t long; it is now over; and even if he makes friends to get from his pre[s]ent cinfinement, I know of no method he can pur[s]ue for future [s]ub[s]i[s]tence. Such young men as the[s]e, [s]aid I, by their folly are often involved in difficulties, which, in hopes of extricating them[s]elves from, they hurry to the gaming table, and finding their expectations frustrated there al[s]o, as the la[s]t re[s]ource, betake themselves to a black crape, a good hor[s]e, and a pi[s]tol. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] \---How careful [s]hould parents and guardians be to in[s]til into the minds of youth of narrow fortunes, meekne[s]s, humility, and indu[s]try! the lea[s]t tendency to thoughtle[s]s extravagance, in either [s]ex ought to be [s]everely cha[s]ti[s]ed; [s]ince pride, and a pa[s][s]ion for expen[s]ive plea[s]ures, which they have no laudable method to obtain, has hurried thou[s]ands into actions which imbitter the la[s]t hours of life with poverty, [s]hame, and remor[s]e. As I fini[s]hed the[s]e remarks, I looked up, expecting an an[s]wer from my companion; but whether my di[s]cour[s]e was too grave, or whether it touched his feelings, or whether [s]ome other cau[s]e had occa[s]ioned him to leave me, I know not, but he was gone; and on my turning round to look for him, I [s]aw he was ha[s]tily proceeding towards town. How ea[s]y it is, [s]aid I, for a man to blame a conduct in others which he is eagerly pur[s]uing him[s]elf; perhaps a few years may reduce that young man to the [s]ame [s]ituation in which he now [s]miles to [s]ee Woudbe---experience is undoubtedly be[s]t when purcha[s]ed; but Woudbe has, I fear, paid an exorbitant price for his. I was now oppo[s]ite Vellum's hou[s]e. Having entered, by means of my ring, I proceeded un[s]een to He[s]ter's apartment---[s]he was greatly altered [s]ince the death of her father; a [s]ickly langour had taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of her features [s]he looked anxious and fatigued. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] I wonder Harper is not returned, [s]aid [s]he to a young woman who was with her: I hope the dear Julietta is not wor[s]e. She had hardly pronounced the words, before a po[s]t chai[s]e [s]topped at the door, and, in a few moments, the injured orphan entered, leaning on the arm of an elderly woman; an univer[s]al trembling [s]eized on He[s]ter when [s]he beheld the ravages which [s]ickne[s]s and ill u[s]age had made on the form of her lovely friend: [s]he led her to a [s]opha, dropped on her knees before her, and, gazing at her with a look that [s]poke the keen angui[s]h of her [s]oul, took her thin hands in hers, and bur[s]t into tears. Do you not know me, my [s]weet friend? [s]aid [s]he, after a long and affecting [s]ilence; will you not [s]peak to me, Julietta? He[s]ter, [s]aid [s]he, bowing her head forward, and leaning her cheek upon that of her weeping friend, He[s]ter, why are you [s]o [s]orrowful? and why are you dre[s][s]ed in black? are you an orphan, He[s]ter? Oh! had it plea[s]ed Heaven I had been, cried He[s]ter, earne[s]tly, rather than you, dear, injured angel, had been reduced to this haple[s]s [s]tate. Alas! [s]aid Julietta, why would you wi[s]h to be an orphan, to have a cruel guardian, to lo[s]e your brother, to eat dry bread and drink cold water, and lie upon a wretched bed of [s]traw? you could not bear it, dear He[s]ter; you would die of a broken heart---for my part, I am u[s]ed to it; I can bear it very well; then let me return to my little hut again--- if my guardian knew I had left it, he would be very angry. And have you [s]uffered all this? cried He[s]ter, weeping bitterly. Oh! Julietta, you never [s]hall return to that [s]ad place again; your cruel guardian is dead. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] Dead! cried Julietta, rai[s]ing her hands and eyes in a [s]upplicating manner; then Heaven have mercy on him. And what do you think of the poor girl's ca[s]e? [s]aid He[s]ter, as [s]he re-entered the room with Dr. M---, after they had per[s]uaded Julietta to go to bed. The doctor gave her great hopes that kind and affectionate treatment would [s]oon entirely re[s]tore her rea[s]on, which he imagined was already beginning to return. Could I but [s]ee that happy day, [s]aid [s]he, and deliver her fortune into her own hands, I [s]hould have no farther bu[s]ine[s]s in this world. How [s]o, my young friend? [s]aid the Doctor, with a look of [s]urpri[s]e; I think you have a great deal of bu[s]ine[s]s in the world yet; why [s]ure, with all your goodne[s]s and accompli[s]hments, you would not [s]hut your[s]elf up in a convent? Why no, [s]aid [s]he; I am not a [s]ufficient convert to the catholic religion to imagine it ab[s]olutely necessary to [s]hut our[s]elves up within the walls of a pri[s]on to avoid the temptations of the world; but, I think, a per[s]on may in [s]olitude better practi[s]e tho[s]e virtues [s]o nece[s][s]ary to our well doing hereafter, than in the noi[s]e and hurry of the more bu[s]y [s]cenes of life.---By [s]olitude, I do not mean to retire to a de[s]ert, and [s]hut my[s]elf from the conver[s]e and [s]ociety of my fellow creatures; I mean a calm retirement, far from folly and di[s][s]ipation, where I may con[s]ult my own heart on the propriety and equity of all my actions, without incurring the [s]neers and ridicule of the world. As to the wealth which my poor unhappy father hoarded, it does not belong to me; it is the property of the widow and the fatherle[s]s. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] Here her tears interrupted her. After this declaration, Doctor, [s]he continued, you will not be [s]urpri[s]ed at my re[s]olution of retiring from the gay [s]cenes of life; and, I flatter myself, I [s]hall in time regain that [s]erenity of mind a [s]eries of uncommon trials have robbed me of. The Doctor was too much affected to reply; he pre[s][s]ed her hand, [s]truggled hard to [s]uppre[s]s a rising tear, and making a ha[s]ty bow, left the room. A few weeks re[s]tored Julietta to rea[s]on, health and [s]pirits; when He[s]ter, having re[s]igned her fortune to her own care, and made ample retribution of tho[s]e [s]ums her father had appropriated to his own u[s]e, during the infanity of his ward, retired to a village, in a county far di[s]tant from London, and [s]pent the remainder of her life in admini[s]tering to the wants of the helple[s]s and di[s]tre[s][s]ed. Her friend[s]hip for Julietta cea[s]ed but with her life; and many [s]ummers has that amiable girl [s]pent with her, uniting in every action of benevolence, and [s]hedding peace and plenty around them; the villagers adored them while living, and mourned with unaffected [s]orrow when deprived by death of their benefactre[s][s]es. I WILL have the mo[s]t elegant that is to be had, Mamma, cried a young lady, as [s]he came out of a carriage, and ran into a milliner's [s]hop, which I had entered to buy [s]ome little pre[s]ents for Harriot and Lucy. Do not let me detain you from waiting on the ladies, [s]aid I to the mi[s]tre[s]s of the [s]hop, for I was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] willing to [s]ee to what lengths this girl's extravagance would take her. I want a bouquet, Mrs. Frippery, [s]aid [s]he; come, [s]hew me [s]ome of the hand[s]ome[s]t you have. The counter was in an in[s]tant over[s]pread with ro[s]es, carnations, lilies, je[s][s]amine, and other flowers innumerable; it looked like the temple of Flora; but I [s]hould by no means have taken the young lady for the divinity of the place, as [s]he was a little [s]warthy figure, with [s]mall black eyes, a good deal marked with the [s]mall pox, and [s]omething inclined to be crooked.---Nature might have made her really [s]o, but her [s]tay-maker had found out a method, in a great mea[s]ure, to hide the defect; her hair was dre[s][s]ed to the extremity of the fa[s]hion; her bonnet, which was large, and loaded with trimming, placed on the left [s]ide of her head; a train of rich [s]atin [s]wept the ground as [s]he walked; the prominence of her handkerchief almo[s]t hid her chin; and her cheeks wore the tints of [s]ome of the be[s]t rouge.---It is a[s]toni[s]hing, [s]aid I, as I [s]at looking at her, that a woman to whom nature has not been lavi[s]h in per[s]onal attractions, [s]hould take [s]uch pains by their outre manner of dre[s][s]ing, entirely to ob[s]cure the few charms with which they are endued, and make their defects con[s]picuous. I was rou[s]ed from the[s]e reflections by the Lady's bidding five guineas for as many flowers. But really, Mrs. Frippery, [s]aid [s]he, have you none more elegant? Why, my dear Mi[s]s, [s]aid the woman, I have one, but it is po[s]itively be[s]poke by the Dutche[s]s of Melvin, and it likewi[s]e comes rather high:---it cannot go out of my [s]hop under [s]even guineas--- though there are not more flowers in it than in the one you have cho[s]en. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] The flowers were produced, the Lady in[s]i[s]ted on having them, and the money was paid. It is a doubt with me, [s]aid I, whether the poor mortal who[s]e indu[s]try and ingenuity formed tho[s]e pretty ornaments, [s]carcely earns more than enough to [s]upport nature; and yet this thoughtle[s]s girl has paid [s]even guineas for them, merely becau[s]e they were be[s]poke by the Dutche[s]s of Melvin. Ju[s]t as the Ladies were about leaving the [s]hop, a [s]mart man, dre[s][s]ed like an officer, who[s]e language [s]poke him hibernian, de[s]ired to look at [s]ome point ruffles; he advanced to the counter at which the young Lady [s]at, and while he [s]eemed bu[s]y at looking at the ruffles, took an opportunity to [s]lip a letter into her hand unperceived by her mother.--- I [s]hall again have recour[s]e to my ring, [s]aid I, for if I am not mi[s]taken, that man is a fortune-hunter. That young Lady, [s]aid Mrs. Frippery, as they drove from the door, is the only child of Alderman Fig---[s]he is heire[s]s to a va[s]t fortune. Two fat old gentlemen pa[s][s]ing ju[s]t then, [s]he informed me that one of them was Mr. Fig him[s]elf. I had made my purcha[s]es, [s]o I [s]tepped out of the [s]hop and followed the Alderman. I HAVE been out on purpo[s]e to get an appetite, [s]aid Mr. Fig;---I think it was the large[s]t turtle I ever [s]aw; and my friend Dip always has his turtles [s]o well dre[s][s]ed, that I long for the hour of dinner. I will ju[s]t [s]tep home and change my wig, and be with you again immediately. Then this is the time, [s]aid I, for me to get admission.--- I put my hand in my pocket for my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v3&image=324-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] ring---but it was gone---I [s]earched every pocket diligently, but no ring could I find. I returned to the milliner's [s]hop, and from thence home--- [s]earched my bed---had every room in the hou[s]e [s]wept; but it was all to no purpo[s]e.---I never [s]aw it again. And pray, Mr. Inqui[s]itor, what became of the City Heire[s]s? Upon my word, Madam, I never heard. FINIS.
