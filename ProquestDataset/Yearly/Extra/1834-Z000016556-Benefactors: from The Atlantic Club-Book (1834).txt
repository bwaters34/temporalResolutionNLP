The home of Lopez was only a cottage; but it was situated beneath the beautiful sky of Andalusia, in the little bishopric of Jaen, at the flowery foot of Sierra Morena. His daughter, Inesilla, his only child---his gentle, his lovely, his darling Inesilla--- dwelt with him there. He regretted riches only on one account. His loss of them must interrupt the education of his daughter. "Inesilla," said he to her, "I have often rendered services; but no one comes to render services to me. There is no such thing in the world as generosity." "The numbers of the ungrateful would seem to prove the contrary," replied Inesilla. "Ingratitude would be less common, if we knew how to appropriate our benefactions; but the rich and powerful, hemmed in as they are by mercenaries, parasites, and adventurers, are intercepted by this mob of slaves, from conveying to virtuous indigence the noble kindness which may relieve without degrading. We should know the characters of those whom we oblige, before we do them services  . We [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf317&image=317-002.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] listen to our hearts, and are deceived. You have yourself done this, and more than once." "I own it. I own it. I was in the wrong." The conversation was interrupted by a clap of thunder. A rapid storm darkened the horizon. Lopez thought no more of the ungrateful. All resolutions of future caution vanished. He flew to fling open the large gate of his cottage yard, that the wayfarer might be sheltered beneath his cartshed from the tempest, whose roar was now redoubled by the mountain echoes. A brilliant carriage, drawn by six mules, at once drove in. Don Fernando descended from it; had his servants and his mules placed under the shed, and presented himself at the door of the cottage of Lopez. Inesilla opened it, and Don Fernando paused with wonder, to meet beneath the lowly thatch a form so sylph-like and a face so refined. The courtly bearing of Lopez seemed to create no less surprise; his astonishment, the earnestness of his questions, the interest he seemed to take in every thing relating to the old man, stimulated Lopez to tell the story of his misfortunes, ending with the moral which his daughter had deduced from them. Fernando heard him with intense attention. "By the sword of the cid!" cried he, "that daughter of thine is a philosopher! `We should know the character of those whom we oblige, before we do them services;' and I bless the storm," added he, tears starting to his eyes, "which has acquainted me with thee and thine; but we should [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf317&image=317-003.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] also bear in mind another truth of which thy daughter's philosophy seems not to be aware. We should also know the characters of those by whom we are obliged, before we let them do us services." The words of Don Fernando sank deep into the heart of Lopez. He felt he had at last found one with whom he wished he could exchange situations, merely that he could render so worthy a man a service. Don Fernando seemed to be animated with a similar yearning towards poor Lopez. "But, Lopez," added he, "it is not from words that characters are to be learned. We must look to actions. From these I would teach you mine. Lopez, I am rich, and I am not heartless. You have bestowed on me the only kindness in your power. Do not be offended. I must not be numbered among the ungrateful. Your fortune must be restored. Deign, till we can bring that about, to let me be your banker." "There is nothing I have to wish for, on my own account," said Lopez; "but my dear girl there, though still in the bloom of early youth, has for a long while been interrupted in her education. Poor darling, she has no associates of her own age and sex about her---no one to supply the place of a mother. The warmest affection of a father never can make up for wants like these." "I have an aunt," replied Fernando, "who inhabits Cazorla with her two daughters, both much about the age of your Inesilla. In this family are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf317&image=317-004.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] blended inexhaustible amiableness, enlightened religion, deep and varied acquirements. Deprived of the gifts of fortune, they have nothing to live on but a moderate pension, of which their virtues, the duties of humanity, and the claims of relationship, concur in rendering it imperative on me to force their acceptance. Cazorla is situated not far hence; just on the skirts of the Vega---a site of surpassing beauty. Go, yourself, in my name. Find my noble relation. Confide to her your Inesilla." Lopez, scarcely hearing him out, caught his hands, and bathed them with tears of gratitude. It was not long before Inesilla was conducted, by her father, to the aunt of Fernando, from whom, and from her daughters, she received a most affectionate welcome; while Lopez, disabused of his prejudices against the world, regained his cottage, satisfied with himself and others, and silently and seriously resolving never more to think slightingly of human nature, and go often and see his daughter. One day he was pondering on his recollections of Fernando, on his delicate liberality, and on his profound proverb, when, casting his eyes unconsciously around, they rested upon a lowly tree, where a poor little orphan-dove, left alone ere the down had enough thickened to shield it from the evening chill, forsaken, as it was, by all nature, filled its forlorn nest with feeble wailings. At that moment, from the mighty summit of the Sierra Morena, a bird of prey---(it was a vulture!)---outspreading his immense wings---pointed his flight downwards [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf317&image=317-005.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] toward the lamenting dove, and for some time hung hovering above the tree which held her cradle. Lopez was instantly on the alert for means to rescue the helpless little victim, when he thought he could perceive that at the sight of the vulture, the infant dove ceased her moan, fluttered joyously, and stretched towards him her open beak. In truth, he really beheld, ere long, the terrible bird, gently descending, charged with a precious booty, toward his baby prot egee , and lavishing on her the choicest nutriment, with a devotedness unknown to vulgar vultures. "Most wonderful!" cried the good Lopez. "How unjust I was! How blind! I refused to believe in beneficence. I find it even among vultures!" Lopez could not grow weary of this touching sight. Day after day he returned to watch it. It opened to him sources of exquisite and inexhaustible meditation. He was enraptured to see innocence strengthened under the wing of power---the weak succored by the strong; and the transition from the nest of the dove to his gentle Inesilla, in happiness at Cazorla, protected by one of the rich and powerful, was so natural, that he returned home, blessing Don Fernando and the vulture. Already had the light down on the little dove deepened into silvery feathers; already, from branch to branch, had she essayed her timid flight upon her native tree; already could her beak, hardened and sharpened, grasp its nourishment with ease. One day the vulture appeared with the accustomed provender. He eyed his adopted intently. [
