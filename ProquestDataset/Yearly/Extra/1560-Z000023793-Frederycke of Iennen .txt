 diuers londes, and howe they woulde all to Paris. In the yere of our lorde god. M.CCCC.xxiiii. It happened that foure ryche marchauntes departed out of diuers countreis for to do their marchaundise and as they were goyng their iourneys by fortune they mette all together and fel in company together, for thei were al foure goyng towarde Paris in Fraunce & for company sake they rode al .iiii. into one ynne, & it was about shraftyd in the mooste ioyfull tyme of al the yere and their names were called as here foloweth. The firste was called Courant of Spayne, the secod was called Borcharde of Fraunce, ye thirde was called Iohn of Forence, & the .iiii. was called Ambrose of Iennen. Than by the consent of the other marchauntes Borcharde of Frauce went vnto the hoste and sayd. Hoste nowe is the meriest tyme of the yere and we be foure marchauntes of foure diuers countreis & by fortune we met altogether in one place & oure iourney is to Paris. And therfore whyle we be so met let vs make good chere together, & ordeine ye best meet yt ye can get for money against to morowe and byd also some of your best frendes that you loue moste, that we maye make good chere together or that we departe fro hence, and we shall contente you all your money agayne. And than the hoste sayd that he woulde do it with a good wil, and than went he and bad many of his good frendes and neighbours to diner, and he bought of the best meet that he coulde get for mouey and brought it home. And on the morowe he dressed it and made it redy againste dyner after the best maner that he could. And wha yt it was diner tyme, than came in the gestes to dyner & the marchautes came to them and bad them welcome. Than bad ye marchauntes the hoste that he should bryng in the meete and lay the table that they myght go to dyner. And than the hoste sayde, with a good wyll. Than went the hoste and layd the table and fetched the meate and set it theron and prayed the marchauntes to take the gestes to them and syt downe together. And so they did & made good chere all the daye longe with good honeste tyll that it was very late with daunsyng and lepyng. And whan they had doone, the gestes toke their leue of the marchauntes and thanked them for their good chere. And than euery man departed home to his house. And than came the marchauntes to the hoste and prayed hym hertely for to come in, and thanked hym that he had ordered and doone all thynges so well and mannerly. Iennen hylde one another. v. thousande golde gyldens. Whan all the marchauntes & the gestes had made mery together al the day log, at nyght the gestes toke their leue of the marchauntes, and thanked them for theyr good chere that they had made them, and so departed euery one to their lodgyng. And as they were departed euery man to their house, then wexed it late. And than came the hoste of the house to the marchauntes and asked them if that they would go slepe, & they aunswered vnto their hoste yes. And tha toke he a candell & brought the marchauntes in to a fayre chambre, where was .iiii. beddes rychely hanged with costl curtartaynes, that euery marchaunt myght lye by them selfe. And whan that they were so altogether in the chabre, than began they to speke of many thinges, some good, some bad as it laye in their myndes. Than sayd Courant of Spayn. Sirs we haue be all this day mery and made good chere & euery one of vs hath a fayre wyfe at home, how fare they nowe at home we can not tell. Tha said Bourchard of Frauce to the other marchauntes. What aske you how they doe. They syt by the fyre and make good chere, and eate and drynke of the beste and labour not at all, & so get they vnto them hote bloud & than they may take another lustye yong man & doe their pleasure with him that we knowe not of, for we be ofte tymes long from the & for the cause may they leen a lofe for a nede secretly to another. Than sayd Iohan of Florence, we may all well be called fooles and ydeotes that trust our wiues in this maner as we do for a womans hert is not made of so harde a stone but yt it wyll melte, for a womans nature is to be vnstedfast & tourneth as the wynde dooeth and careth not for vs tyll the time that we come agayn. And we labour dayly both in wynde and in raine and put often our liues in ieopardy and in auenture on the sea for to fynde them withall & our wyues syt at home and make good chere with other good felowes, & geue the parte of the money that we get. And therfore and ye wyll do after my counseyll, let euery one of vs take a faire wenche to pas the time withall as wel as our wiues do, & they shall knowe no more of that than we knowe of them. Than saide Ambrosius of Iennen to them. By goddes grace that shall I neuer dooe whyle that I lyue. For I haue at home a good & a vertuous woman and a womaly. And I know wel that she is not of that disposition, but that she will eschewe her of all suche yll abusions till the tyme that I come home agayne, for I knowe wel that she wil haue none other ma but me alone. And if that I should breake my wedlocke than were I but litle worthe. Than sayde Iohn of Florence. Felowe ye set muche price by your wife at home & trust her with all that ye haue I wil laye with you a wager of fyue thousande gyldens if that ye will abyde me here I shall departe and ryde to Iennen and dooe with your wyfe my wyll. Than sayd Ambrosius to Iohn of Florence. I haue delyuered to myne hoste fiue thousand gyldens to kepe, put ye downe as muche againste it and I shall tary here tyll the tyme that ye retourne agayne from Iennen, and if that you by any maner of menes can get your pleasure of my wyfe ye shall haue all this money. Than sayde Iohan of Florence. I am contente, and than putte he in his hostes hande other fyue thousande gyldens agaynst Ambrosius money. And than tooke he his leue & departed towarde Iennen. And as he rode thider warde he thought in his mynde by what maner of wyse yt he myght come best to speke with Ambroses wyfe that he myghte haue his pleasure of her, & wynne the money that he had layde with Ambrose to a wager, whether it were by ryght or by wrong. And at the laste he had roden so long that he came to Iennen where that Ambrose wyfe dwelte. wyfe & whan that he came in her presence for to speke to her he durste not bicause that he founde her so womanly in her behauoure. And whan that Iohan of Florence was come to Iennen, he wente walkyng al aboute to se yf that he coude spy Ambrosius wyfe. And as he was walkynge came Ambrosius wyfe to chyrche, so that Iohan behelde her & spake to her, and bad her good morow. And she thanked hym and gaue vnto him agayne swete wordes & womanly behauoure, so that he was a shamed and sayd to hym selfe. Alas poore wretche that I am, what haue I done, the money is lost I se it wel. For she semeth a worshypfull woman and I dare not speke to her of that vylany wherof I am sory. And as he walked thus he thought in hys mynde that yf that he shold wyne ye money he must nedes come in to her chambre. And than made he a chest that he wolde haue conueyd in to the womans chambre and he wyst not how. Than remembred he him and sayd, I haue herde saye that the dyuell can not do that an olde woma can do, and he thought to proue it. And than went he to the olde clothe marked where he foude an olde woma that solde olde clothes which he thought best for him. But he sayd, how shal I speke beste to her to shewe my mynde. Than broughte Iohn of Florence with him a cote of sylke and came to the olde woman and sayd yf that ye coude sel this cote I shold gyue you a good drinkynge penny for it is al to heuy for me. The woma saide to hym. How wyll you sel your sylken cote, than answered he yf that ye may sel it for .ii. ducates let it goo. But the cote was well worth seuen ducates. Than was the olde woman glad in her mynde and bad yt he shold come agayne the morowe after and he sholde haue his monye and she sayd to her selfe, this is my marchaunt. And tha departed he home and on the nexte daye in the mornynge came Iohan of Florence to the olde woman againe and she gaue vnto hym the .ii. ducates and she tolde him that she coude haue no more, but she kepte the cote too her selfe And than Iohan of Florence receyued the two ducates of the olde woma and thanked her. And tha he cast downe one of the ducates to her and said vnto her. Take that & fetche the best meet & drynke yt ye can get. For we two must make good chere or that we departe, & that dyd he for to make the woman dronken yt he myghte haue some good counseile of her for to come in to Ambroses hous, & at dyner tyme came Iohan of Florence to dyne with the olde woman & there he made good chere and gaue vnto the olde woman soo moche wyne that she began to wexe mery. And that seynge Iohan of Florence sayd to ye olde wyfe yt was worser tha the deuyl. Knowe ye not a marchaunt that is called Ambrose, & the olde woma answered yes I know hym wel he is not at home, but he hath here a fayre woman to his wyfe dwellynge, that is bothe yonge & worshypfull of behauoure, curteyse in answere gentyl, not proude, good for to speke withall. Than sayd Iohan of Florence know ye not the way yt ye myght couay a chest in to her hous, & I my selfe wil shypt me ther in. And whan that the chest hath stande in her hous by ye space of .iii. daies tha come & fetche ye chest home againe, & yf that ye can do it I shal gyue vnto you .CC. ducates for your laboure with a better drinkyng peny. Tha was the olde woman glad wt that profer & sayde vnto him O my frende sorowe not for that thynge, brynge the chest in to my hous and shyt you fast therin and I shall fynde suche wayes that the cheste shall be conueyed in to her house. Than was Iohn of Florence glad and did as the olde woman bad him and fetched the cheste and brought it in to her house and put him selfe therein. house till the tyme that she come from saynt Iames. After that Iohn of Florence had promysed to the olde woman the .CC. ducates he woulde se fyrste that she shold erne the before yt she shold haue them. And the olde woman sought and ymagined many falsenes to haue the money. Than went she to Ambroses wyfe with a false herte and greted her, and louyngly thanked her & bad her welcome to her. For she semed to her for to bee a good honest woman, but she was but a dissimeler of cloked falshede, for it is a commyn saiyng of people that an olde woman can do that the deuell hym selfe can not do, as we haue in examples more playnely thereof in many diuerse bokes, and as this litle boke maketh mencion. Than whan the olde woman had talked a good while wt Ambroses wife of many diuers matters. Than sayde she to her. Maistres, my comyng to you at this tyme is for this cause. I did vowe a pilgrimage a longe tyme to the holy apostle saint Iames, and nowe take I iorney & if it please you to sende any offring thither. I shal bere it with a good will. And than thanked Ambroses wyfe her and gaue vnto her a ducate and said that she should offre that ducate to saynt Iames to saue her husbande from the perill of the sea & sodayne death. Than toke ye olde woman the ducate and sayd worshypful maistres I desire you of one thyng. I haue a cheste here that all my Iewels ben in and all my chefe plates, and I would desyre you to kepe it in youre house, tyll the tyme that I come home to you agayn. For ye be the woman that I truste and beleue aboue all other women now beyng alyue. Than said Ambroses wife, that wyll I do with a good will, & I shall set it sure inough. For I will set it in my chamber that it may be the surer kept. Than was the olde woman glad in her mynde, and thanked her and departed homewarde for the cheste. Ambroses house. And wha this false olde woma hadde ordeyned all thynges after her minde and knewe that Ambroses wife wolde take the cheste into her house, than wente she and put Iohn of Florence in the cheste secretly that no body wyste therof and gaue hym in the cheste meate and drinke for three or foure daies, soo that he neded nothynge. And the cheste was made with a spryng locke, so that Iohn of Florence myght open and shitte in what that he would at his pleasure. And than did the olde woman laye the chest vpon a whelebarowe and gate twoo stronge men to cary it to Ambroses house. And whan they were come there with the chest, the olde woma came to Ambroses wyfe and tolde her that she had the chest at the dore. And than Ambroses wyfe bad her brynge the cheste in, and set it in her owne chambre thynkyng of no deceyte nor falshede. Than went the olde woman to the dore and bade the two men bryng in the cheste and bere it vp in to the chambre, and so they dyd. And than whan it was in the chambre, than she payed the men and they departed from thence. And than tooke the olde woman leue of Ambroses wyfe, and so departed homewarde very glad and mery. Ambroses chabre and stale .iii. Iuwels. Whan nyght came that euerye body was a slepe in their first slepe & at reste, than did Iohn open the chest and went out in to the chamber. And by misfortune Ambroses wife had left her cofer open wherein ye Iewels were, & had forgot to shytte it. And that spied wel ye false Iohn of Florence, & theyr he stale three costly Iewelles. The one was a purse wrought al with perles and costly stones, beyng worth .lxxxiiii. ducates, and the other was a gyrdle of fyne golde set with costly perles and stoones that was worth .CCCC. ducates. And the thyrde was a a rynge with a point of diamond that was worth .l. ducates. And the moone shone so clere that he myght see in euery corner of the chamber, and there he behelde Ambroses wife that was soundely a slepe. And than it fortuned that her lefte arme lay on the bed, & on that arme she had a blacke warte that the false traitoure Iohn of Florence sawe well, wherwith he reioysed and sayd. O good lorde what great fortune haue I. For now haue I sene a pryuy token, wherby he shall byleue me that I haue had my pleasure of his wyfe, and so shall I haue the money of hym. Than wente the fals thefe with the Iewelles agayne in to the chest and shyt hym self fast therin. And on the thyrde day after came the olde woman to Ambroses wyfe & gaue to her agayne the ducate that she sholde haue borne to saynt Iames & sayde. Worshypfull maystrys I haue gote a grete sekenes, that I wene wyl tary longe by me. And therfore I wel not take this Iornaye on me this yere. And therfore I praye you yt I myghte haue my cheste agayne, & I thanke you hertely of youre good wyll. Than delyuered Ambroses wyfe the cheste to ye olde woman, mystrustynge nothynge & knewe not yt therof sholde come ony heuynes. And than departed the olde woma home wt the chest agayne. And whan it was in ye olde womans hous than opened Iohan of Florence the chest and came out, and than he gaue to the olde woman .CC. ducates for her laboure and toke his leue of her & rode to Parys, whece that Ambrose taryed hym. And whan that he was come to Parys than rode he in to the ynne where that Ambrose was. And than set he vp his horse and came to Ambrose & called hym a syde & sayde, bycause that ye be a good frende of myne, and we haue kepte company togyder, and that ye sholde not be a shamed I call you asyde, for to shewe vnto you that I haue wonne the money. Se, here I haue euydente tokens for to shewe that I haue wonne it. And than toke Iohan of Florence outte the purse, the gyrdell, and the rynge, and shewed those thre Ieweles vnto Ambrose. Than sayd Ambrose, I knowe well yt those thre Iewels be my wyues, but yet I wyll not byleue yt ye haue hadde your wyl on her. But ye must tel me sone better and pryuyer token than these be. And than sayd Iohan, ye wyll byleue me and I tell vnto you a more preuier token than these be. Than he tolde vnto Ambrose that his wyfe had vpon her lefte arme a blacke wart. And whaa yt Ambrose herde that than fel he in a sownde. For he knewe not the falsenes of Iohan. Than Iohan toke Ambrose vp and bad hym take a mans herte vnto hym and let it passe, for he coude not therwith amende it. And whan that Ambrose was vp agayne, than he sayde. Alas what is my fortune, I had went that my wyfe wolde neuer haue deceyued me as she hath done, for she was bothe worshypfull and vertuous and beloued bothe of yonge and olde. And than bad Ambrose Iohan of Florece that he sholde tel it no ferther to ony bodye, and badde him goo to the hoste and fetche the money, and so he dyde. And there was no man, but he and Ambrose that knewe who had wonne the money. Than forth with departed Ambrose frome Parys & toke his Iourney towarde Ienne wt a soroweful herte. And whan he cam to Iennen he wente in to a certayne place of his that he had gyuen to kepe to a certayne man of his yt he knewe sure and trusty. And than came Ambrose in and called the man to him. And tha he came, & whan yt he was come he sayd to him, my seruaut I knowe well that you be trusty and trewe & you muste do one thyng for me yt I shal commaunde you and swere on a boke yt ye wyl do it, & so ye seruaunte dyde swere yt he wolde. Tha sayd he to hym yt he sholde byd his maystris come to hym there, & whan yt she was come that he shold slee her and burye her in the soude. Than sayde the seruaunt to his mayster, that were grete pyty. Than sayd Ambrose, yf ye do it not I shall slee you. Than sayde the seruaunte. I wyll, for he thoughte it was better to slee his maystrys than his selfe to be slayne. And than departed he towarde his maystrys with a sorowfull herte. And as the man was come to the towne he came to his maystrys & tolde her yt her husbande was come & taryed her at his house without the towne. Than was Ambroses wyfe glad & wente with ye man and caryed wt her a lytell lambe yt she was wonte to play with all. And whan they came without the towne in the wod, than saide the seruaunt to his maistres. O good maystres, my maister hath charged me vpon payne of death that I should slee you here and bryng to hym for a token your tongue and a locke of youre heere. And whan she herde that she fell downe on her knees and sayde. I haue neuer offended him for to dye, and therfore good lady delyuer me from this daunger as I am gyltlesse. And as soone as she had done her prayer she sayde to the man. My true seruaunt, I shall geue you good counseyle. I haue a lambe here we shall kyll it and take his tongue, & I wyll cut a locke of my here, and with the bloud anoynt my clothes and bere these tokens to your maister. And than sayde the seruaunt to his maistres, that shall I doo with a good wil, but ye must departe from hence that my maister se you not. For if he doe, than shall we bothe lese our lyues. And than departed she, and than kylde he the lambe and did as she bad him and bare the tokens to his maister. And whan Ambrose sawe theim, than was he more sorier than he was before because that he spake not with her before that he caused her to be put to death, to examyne her wherfore Iohn of Florence had the Iewels. And the man seing howe his maister that he founde no faulte with the tokens. He thanked God and our lady of the good counsayle of the woman. Than clothed Ambroses wyfe her selfe in mas clothynge and came to Secant to an hauen, where she found a shyppe redy to goe. Than desired she that she might go with it. And than asked the shypman what is your name? and she aunswered hym. Frederike is my name, and I haue had a greate losse bothe of my frendes and my goodes, so that I am vndone. Than sayde the shypman, ye be a propre man, wil ye serue me? for I haue here hawkes that I must bryng to the kynge of Alkare, that shall ye kepe and I wil geue vnto you good wages. Than sayd Frederyke, with a good wyll. And than toke they their passage and came ouer and presented the kyng the hawkes, and he rewarded theim well. And as soone as Frederyke was departed, than began the hawkes to drope, than was the kynge angry and sente forthe shypman and asked him what haukes he had broughte. We bad you bryng of the beste, and see what haukes ye haue brought. Than sayde the shypman, whan that I hadde theim in the shyppe they were fayre and good, as anye man myght see. And I hyred a propre man that came to me by fortune that kepte theim diligentely and for that cause they morne. Than sayd the kynge. Bryng to me the man and let me se hym. Than sayde the shypman. My lege I will fetche him. But if it please your grace I am lothe to departe with hym. For he is bothe wyse and subtyll in many causes. And if youre grace haue hym, ye muste kepe hym that no persone do to hym wrong. Than sayde the kyng. Gooe fetche hym hether and we promyse you that no man soo hardy of his head shall dooe hym wronge. And than toke the shypman leue of the kynge and so departed. Than was the kyng very sory for his haukes for he went that they would haue dyed. And whan Frederike was come before the king and sawe hym, than had he a great fauoure vnto him and brought him to his haukes, and as sone as the haukes sawe him they reioysed and flapped with their wynges & were hole, whereof ye kyng was glad and meruayled gretly therat. And than gaue he Frederyke charge of his haukes & he kept them well, so that the king loued him wel & promoted him and made him a gret officer in his court & after that a knight and than he made him a lorde. Than in the meane tyme befel in the towne a great death so that the king wold departe from thense. Than as he departed he called to him lorde Frederyke and made hym lorde defender of all his londe, tyll the tyme that he retourned agayne whan that dethe were paste. And than dyd the kynge and all his lordes take theyr leue of lorde Frederyke, and departed fro thense. many townes after the departynge of the kynge. Than as the kynge and his lordes were departed than had his enemyes knowlege that he was departed, & came with a grete hoste and brente, & slewe, and toke many prysoners. And at ye last this tydynges came to Frederyke that was lord & defender of the kynges realme. Than assembled he a grete hoost and cam agaynst his enemyes, and slewe them downe afore him lyke a lyon & dyde many meruaylous faytes of armes that daye For he broke theyr ordynaunce & made theim for to scatter a brode as it had ben loste shepe and so that daye had lorde Frederyke grete vyctory and folowed his enemyes and toke many prysoners of the captaynes and gret lordes of whome he had grete raunsome. And whan that the warre was done and that lord Frederyke had sette ye londe in peace through the grete boldenes and hardynes of hym, than tydynges was brought to the kynge: wherof the kynge was glad of ye greate fayte yt his newe captayne had done. Than retourned the kynge to his towne agayne where that lorde Frederyke was and whan that lorde Frederyke hade knowlege of his commynge, than receyued he the kynge with great honoure in to the towne. And whan that the kynge was with in he sayde to Frederyke. I thanke you my trewe and faythfull seruaunt of the great dedes of armes that ye haue done forme puttynge your body and lyfe in ioperdye and for that cause I make you lorde protectoure and defender of all my londe. For I am am aged man, and you be yong and lusty and a valyaunt man. And tha thanked Frederyke ye kynge & toke ye charge on hym, and gouerned the realme worshipfuly so that al ye lordes & knightes loued him wel and al the comens. And he regned .xii. yere wt greate honoure and dayly gettynge more therto. Upon a tyme wente Iohan of Florence to the see wyth his marchaundyse yt was but lyght passage toward ye towne of Alkare. For he coulde speke many dyuerse languages. And whan he was come to Alkare he wente to ye kynges palayce & shewed his marchaudyse. Thanne on a daye as lorde Frederyke and his lordes walked aboute, lorde Frederyke sawe the marchaunte standynge with his marchaudyse. Than wente he wyth his lordes to Iohan of Florece. And whan he was come he loked asyde and sawe the gyrdle, ye purse, & the ryng, whiche he knewe well Inough, and sayd. Marchaunt let me se those thre costely Iewels yt ye haue there & shewe me I pray you in what londe ye bought them. Than sayd Iohan of Florence. I bought theym not, but yf ye wyste how daungerously I came by them, ye wolde loue me the better euer after. Than sayd lorde Frederyke, that grete daunger muste ye tell me. Than tolde Iohan of Florence to lorde Frederyke howe yt he came by them, & howe that he layd .v. thousande geldens with Ambrose that he sholde haue goten his pleasure of his wyfe and how that he gate the Iewels vnknowen to his wyfe, & than retourned I to her husbande and tolde hym that I had wonne the money and than retourned he home and caused his man for to slee her (as is before shewed more playnly). Than sayd lorde Frederyke, the sleynge of hys wyfe was yll done, but ye money was goten with a wonder grete practyse and well, but for all that lorde Frederyke spake so, yet he thought not soo. Than said he to the marchaunte, wyll ye tary with vs here and we shall gyue vnto you mete and drynke out of my court, & kepe those Iewelles that ye haue here for me, for they please me wonderly well, & nowe haue I no leasure to gyue to you the money at this time. For they be so costly that the money wyl be longe a tellynge, & they shal serue for my paramoure. Than thaked Iohan of Florence lorde Frederyke that he was so curteyse to him and sayd. These thre Ieweles be so costely & of to hyghe a price to gyue to his paramoure wtout yt he loued her very well. And than departed lorde Frederyke fro the marchaunt & charged his offycers that they sholde gyue vnto the marchaunte his lyuery for two or thre men euery daye. And they sayde, they wolde with a good wyll. So on the morowe came Iohan of Florence for his lyuerey and they gaue it vnto hym, so that he neded not for too spende but yf he wolde Tha pryuely called lorde Frederyke a poste and asked of hym yf that he knewe wel where that the towne of Iennen was. And he answered, yes lorde I knowe it well. Than sayd lorde Frederyke, thyder must ye as faste as ye may go, & there is money ynoughe. And whan ye bee there than aske for one Ambrose a wedower, & wha that ye speke wt hym delyuer vnto hym this letter, & brynge hym with you. And this letter was wryten as though the kynge hym selfe had sende it. Through the commaundement of lorde Frederike departed the messengere towarde Iennen, & passed ouer the see and at the laste came to Iennen, & whan that he was there, he asked where yt Ambrose dwelte, & he asked so longe yt at the last he came to him & presented the letter to hym wt the kynges brode seale, and he receyued it humbly and opened it. And this was the tenoure as here foloweth. We kynge of Alkaren desyre of oure frende Ambrose for a nedeful cause that we haue to doo, which shall be a grete profyt vnto you wherwith ye shal be made ryche, so yt ye wolde spede you & come with this messenger to vs and ye shal haue no maner of harme done to you, for we send to you oure brode seale and Saufcoundute bothe to goo and to come fre. And as Ambrose reed this letter he wondered gretly of ye hasty desyre of ye kynge. Neuerthelesse he dressed his gere & set one in his hous to kepe it tyll the tyme yt he retourned agayne. And than departed he with the messenger. And they passed ouer the see & came to lorde Frederyke that bad him wel come & made him good chere, & on ye morowe came lorde Frederyke to Ambrose and made hym come to dyner wt hym. And he his owne persone toke & set hym at ye kynges owne table & set hym selfe downe therby, & oftentymes in the dyner he bad that Ambrose sholde be mery, & whan dyner was done than sayd lorde Frederyke to the king. My lege here is come to this towne a marchaunte that hath broughte thre costely Iewelles whiche that I wolde yt ye had sene, and therfore wyll I sende for hym and byd hym brynge his thre Ieweiles with hym. And than wente a messenger and bad Iohan of Florence yt he sholde make hym redy and come before the kynge wyth his thre Iewels. Than was Iohan of Florence glad & thought yt he sholde haue receyued moche money & went wt the messenger to the kynge in to the halle. And whan he was come, lorde Frederyke sayde vnto hym. Syr shewe your marchaundyse & shewe howe that ye came by them to the kyng. Than sheweth he the thre Iewels, and than Ambrose seyng the Iewels, woundered and wente than that the kynge had sent for hym to put him to death and than fel he for sorowe almoste to the grounde. This markyng lorde Frederyke came and comforted hym and clapped him on the sholder and sayde he shoulde haue no harme, but Joye. Than tolde the marchaunt to the king altogether howe that he had gotten the Iewels. Than went the lorde Frederyke with the kyng asyde and asked the kyng what that marchaunt had deserued that hadde dishonoured suche a worshipfull woman and had begyled her in that maner of her Iewels, and after that loste her lyfe therfore.

Than sayde lorde Frederyke so thynketh me also that he hath deserued it well for to be his rewarde. But if that it please your grace and the lordes to returne againe into the hall, ye shall see and knowe many other marueylous thinges that that false marchaut hath done to that worshipfull woman. Than sayde the kyng, with a good wyll that shall we do. Than retourned the kynge and all his lordes with lorde Frederyke into the hall agayne, for to here more of the marchaunte. With those wordes tourned the king into the hall where he and his lordes spake of manye dyuerse straunge matters, and in the meane whyle went the lorde Frederyke secretly away, & came into the chamber where she did vnclothe her al naked sauing a clothe before her membres, & than came into the hall, before the kyng and al his lordes, & before all the other persones there beynge present all naked, saue that she had a kercher of sylke before her membres.

Than saide the kynge to his lordes, that persone haue I sene before oftentymes in other araymet than she is now and if I should tell trewe, me thynketh it is our protectour and defender lorde Frederyke. And therfore sayd the kynge to her shew to vs what ye be, and wherfore that ye come in here before vs al naked in this maner. Than answered the woman to the kyng and saide. I am the same persone lorde Frederike that you spake on, your poore subiecte.

Than said ye kyng to her, that must I nedes do for right and reason wil desire none other, and therefore for that yll dede that he hathe done we wil that he be headed, and than after that his body to be layde vpon the whele, ouer him a paire of galowes, because that he hath stolen, and also caused murder to be done and therfore take him by and by. Than was Iohn of Florence taken and broughte to pryson and all his goodes giuen to Ambrose and his wyfe. Than sayde Ambrose to Iohn of Florence. O poore wretche & katyf, what helpeth you now al your craft & falshed and al that yll gotten good? that ye haue gotten by falshed and theft, for now at the last is your traytership & false dede openly knowen. And nowe therfore must ye suffre a shamefull death, and that shall be your rewarde, better ye had bene to haue done right and than ye had not come to that ye be at. Than aunswered Iohn of Florence, that is truth. I haue well deserued my death. Than toke the officers Iohn of Florence and brought hym besyde of the galowes where the Iustice should be done. And whan that he had made his prayers and all doone, than made the hangman him knele downe, and smote Iohans of Florence head of, and after that laied his body vpon a whele and the head he stycked on a stake and set it by, ouer the head a galowes all after the maner as the kyng had iudged him, and than retourned home againe. And in this maner was Iohn of Florence serued for his great falshed and thefte that he hadde done to that trewe wyfe and mayde. For it is neuer seene yet that murdre and thefte was neuer so long kept, but at laste it is knowen.

And whan he had done he fell before her on his knees & asked her forgyuenes for that grete wronge that he had doone to her so hastely not spekynge to her before. Than dydde she take hym vp and sayd to hym. Be contente my good loue, I forgyue you frely as thoughe you had neuer done it.
