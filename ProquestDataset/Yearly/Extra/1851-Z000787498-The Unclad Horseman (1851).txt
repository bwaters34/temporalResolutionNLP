As the author of "Major Jones's Courtship," Mr. Thompson has gained a lasting reputation as a humorous writer. He first became known to the Southern people as editor of the Augusta Mirror,  a literary paper published at Augusta, Ga. This paper was afterwards merged into the Family Companion, a magazine issued monthly at Macon, Ga., and edited by Mr. T. and Mrs. Sarah Lawrence Griffin. The magazine was discontinued, however, for want of patronage, and Mr. Thompson became editor of the Western Continent, at Baltimore. After several years' connexion with this paper, he disposed of it, and is now editor of the Morning News, of Savannah, Ga., one of the best daily papers published. In addition to "Major Jones's Courtship," Mr. T. has published "Major Jones's Sketches of Travel," and the "Chronicles of Pineville." His pictures of Georgia life are true to nature, and prove him to be not inferior, in that line, to Longstreet, the celebrated author of "Georgia Scenes." Widowers should look out for breakers. Absalom Nippers was a widower, and one of the particularest men, perhaps, that ever lived; though some people said that when his wife was alive he used to dress as a common field hand, and didn't use to take any pains with himself at all. Every body knows how he spruced up about six weeks after Mrs. Nippers died, and how he went to church regular every Sunday; but they didn't have no confidence in his religion, and used to say he only went to church to show his new suit of mourning, and to ogle the gals. With such a character among the wimmin, it ain't to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf723T&image=723-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] be supposed that he stood any chance of getting another Mrs. Nippers near home; and whether he was as bad to his first wife as they said he was, or not, one thing was certain, he had to look abroad for some one to fill her place. Mr. Nippers was very lucky in finding a gal just to his mind, what lived about ten miles from his plantation. Nancy Parker was rich, and though she wasn't very young nor very handsome, she belonged to Mr. Nippers' church, and filled his eye exactly; so he sot in courtin' her with all his might. Ten miles was a good long ride, and as he was an economical man, he used to ride over to old Mrs. Parker's plantation every Sunday morning to go to church with the family, take dinner with them, and ride back in the cool of the evening. In that way he managed to kill two birds with one stone; that is, to advance the prospect of his happiness on this earth and the world to come at the same time, without losing any of his week-day time. A ride over a dusty road is apt to soil a gentleman's dry goods, and make him and his horse very tired. However, Mr. Nippers didn't mind the fatigue as much as his horse; but in a matter such as he had in hand, it was very important that he should make as good an impression as possible, so he adopted a plan by which he was able to present himself before the object of his affections, in order, with his Sunday coat as clean, and his blooming ruffles as fresh and neat as if they had just come out of a band-box. This was a happy expedient, and nobody but a widower lover would think of it. He used to start from home with his new coat and shirt tied up in a pocket handkerchief, and after riding within a quarter of a mile of Mrs. Parker's plantation, he would turn off into a thicket of chinkapin bushes and there make his rural [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf723T&image=723-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] toilet. One bright Sunday morning Mr. Nippers had arrived at this dressin' ground. It was an important occasion. Everything was promisin', and he had made up his mind to pop the question that very day. There was no doubt in his mind that he would return home an engaged man; and he was reckonin' over to himself the value of Miss Nancy's plantation and niggers, while he was settin' on his horse makin' his accustomed change of dress. He had dropped the reins on his horse's neck, what was browsin' about, makin' up his last night's scanty feed from the bushes in his reach, and kickin' and stampin' at such flies as was feedin' on him in return. "I'll fix the business this time," ses Mr. Nippers to himself. "I'll bring things to a pint this time," ses he, and he untied his handkerchief with his clean clothes, and he spread them on his saddle-bow. "Wo, Ball!" says he---"I've just got to say the word, and---wo!" ses he to his horse, what was kickin' and rearin' about. "Wo! you old fool!---and the business is settled jist like fallin' off a log." He was drawin' his shirt over his head, when Ball gave a sudden spring, what like to made him lose his balance. "Wo!" ses he---but before he could get his arms out of the sleeves, Ball was wheelin' and kickin' like wrath at something that seemed to trouble him behind. Down went the clean clothes, shirt and all, on the ground. "Wo! Blast yer pictur---wo, now!" ses Mr. Nippers, grabbin' at the reins. But before he could get hold of 'em, Ball was off like a streak of lightnin', with a whole swarm of yellow jackets round his tail. Mr. Nippers grabbed hold of the mane and tried to stop his horse, but it was no use. Away went the infuriated Ball, and takin' the road he was used to travellin', another moment brought him to the house. The gate was open, [
