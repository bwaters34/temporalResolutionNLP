But you do not con[s]ider, [s]aid my friend, that this book ab[s]olutely requires a preface---it is the adventures of a gentleman who po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a magic ring: and [s]eemingly tho[s]e adventures are written by him[s]elf, but you give no account how they came into your hands? Why they came into my hands through my brain, friend, [s]aid I --- The[s]e adventures are merely the children of Fancy. I mu[s]t own that the be[s]t part of them originated in facts. But why do you make your Inqui[s]itor a man? [s]aid he. For a very obvious rea[s]on, I replied. A man may be with propriety brought forward in many [s]cenes where it would be the height of improbability to introduce a woman.---I might, to be [s]ure, continued I, have introduced the following pages by [s]aying I had found them in a hackney coach; or met with part of them by accident at a pa[s]try cook's or cheesemonger's, and being intere[s]ted by the narrative, I [s]ent back for the remainder; or they might have been left in a lodging by [s]ome eccentric old gentleman who had lived there for many years; and thinking [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page vi. ] the world would be greatly obliged to me for suffering [s]uch a valuable manu[s]cript to be printed, I was prevailed on by the earne[s]t entreaties of my friends, to commit it to the hands of the book[s]eller. I know, Sir, this is the u[s]ual method of u[s]hering the[s]e kind of publications into the world---but, for my own part, I will hone[s]tly confe[s]s that this work was written [s]olely for my amu[s]ement. As to the motives that induced me to publi[s]h it, they can be of no con[s]equence for the reader to be informed of, therefore they [s]hall remain a [s]ecret. But [s]ure, [s]aid my friend, you will make [s]ome apology for attempting to write in the [s]tyle of the inimitable Sterne? Is the per[s]on required to make an apology who copies a portrait painted by an eminent ma[s]ter, [s]aid I; or [s]hould he fail of retaining in his copy, the fine [s]trokes, the beautiful and [s]triking expre[s][s]ion in the features of the faultle[s]s original; is he to tear his picture, or commit it to the flames, becau[s]e he has not the genius of the arti[s]t who[s]e work he copied? Or, [s]uppo[s]e a man admired his Sovereign's exalted virtues, and with a laudable ambition [s]trove to imitate them, is he, becau[s]e he is con[s]cious of not having the abilities to [s]hine in the mo[s]t eminent degree, not to endeavour to imitate them at all; or to hide from the world the progre[s]s he makes? No, certainly, [s]aid my friend; but have you the vanity to [s]uppo[s]e that your writings are the lea[s]t tinctured with that [s]pirit and fire, which are [s]o conspicuous in the works of your bright original? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page vii. ] By no means, [s]aid I; but I think as the [s]tars [s]hine brighte[s]t when neither the [s]un nor moon are in the firmament, [s]o, perhaps, when the works of Sterne are not at hand, the Inqui[s]itor may be read with [s]ome [s]mall degree of attention, and afford the reader a little amu[s]ement; but [s]hould Maria or Le Fevre, make their appearance, its weak rays will be extingui[s]hed by the tear of [s]en[s]ibility, which the lovelorn virgin and dying [s]oldier would excite. Then you do not intend to write a preface? [s]aid my friend. Upon my word, I replied, I have begun [s]everal, but I never could write one to plea[s]e me; [s]o I have at la[s]t determined to publi[s]h it without, and leave it to the readers to form what conjecture they plea[s]ed concerning how I came po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of the papers which contained the adventures. That will never do, [s]aid he, [s]haking his head. Then prithee, my good friend, [s]aid I, do write a preface for me; for here I have been hammering my pericranium and biting my nails the[s]e two hours, without being able to beat out a [s]ingle [s]entence, either introductory or prefatory. Suppo[s]e, [s]aid he, you pre[s]ent your readers with our conver[s]ation; it will be better than no preface at all. It was a lucky thought, and I in[s]tantly [s]et about it. Gentle reader, I here commit to your kind patronage this offspring of Fancy; my characters are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page viii. ] not pointed at particular per[s]ons, except one or two where gratitude involuntarily guided my pen; it was then I delineated the characters of a Lady Allworth, and the family of the amiable [s]i[s]ters at H-m---rf---th. As to tho[s]e characters which appear in an unamiable light, I neither wi[s]h or mean for any per[s]on to [s]ay that this is meant for Mr. or Mrs. [s]uch a one; but I would wi[s]h every per[s]on who may think the character was de[s]igned for them[s]elves, to remember that the likene[s]s was accidentally taken, and it is con[s]cience only that makes it appear [s]o [s]triking to their imagination. INQUISITOR; OR, INVISIBLE RAMBLER. IN THREE VOLUMES. By Mrs. ROWSON, author of Victoria . THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION. VOLUME I. The PETITION. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] I Should like to know the certainty of it, [s]aid I, putting the petition into my pocket.---It contained an account of an unfortunate trade[s]man reduced to want, with a wife and three [s]mall children.---He asked not charity for him[s]elf, but them.---I [s]hould like to know the certainty of it, [s]aid I---there are [s]o many feigned tales of di[s]tre[s]s, and the world is [s]o full of duplicity, that in following the dictates of humanity we often encourage idlene[s]s.---Could I but be [s]atisfied of the authenticity of this man's [s]tory, I would do [s]omething for him. Will your honour plea[s]e to [s]end an an[s]wer?---[s]aid the child, that brought the petition. I had forgot her---by the unaffected innocence of her countenance, [s]he could [s]carcely have [s]een nine years.---Meekne[s]s [s]miled in her [s]weet eyes---what a lovely flower, [s]aid I---'tis a pity the chilling breath of [s]orrow [s]hould vi[s]it thee too rudely---I gave her half a guinea, and bid her tell her father to come to me the next morning. How happy [s]hould I be if [s]ome good fairy, as in days of yore, would give me the power of vi[s]iting unseen, the receptacles of the mi[s]erable, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] habitations of vice and luxury.---What a [s]atisfaction I [s]hould feel in rewarding and [s]upporting merit; or withdrawing the veil, and di[s]covering the hideous aspe of hypocri[s]y. Be[s]ides, [s]ays [s]elf-love, I [s]hould then have an opportunity of di[s]covering the sentiments of the world concerning my[s]elf. I [s]hould find my real friends, and detect my enemies.---If half my fortune could procure [s]uch a power, I would freely give it. Search your heart, replies a [s]oft voice, and [s]ee if it is not an unwarrantable curio[s]ity, rather than a real wi[s]h to do good, that now in[s]pires you. It is [s]trange, [s]aid I; I hear a voice, but [s]ee no per[s]on near me; [s]urely I do not dream! Be not [s]urpri[s]ed, continued my invi[s]ible companion, I am your guardian genius, and have it in my power to comply with your wi[s]hes, provided they are corrected by rea[s]on.---Look on that table and you will [s]ee a ring, which, when on your finger, will render you invi[s]ible; and, as long as humanity, honor, or friend[s]hip, leads you to u[s]e it, it will contribute to your happine[s]s; but whenever you endeavour to make it [s]ub[s]ervient to any unworthy purpose, it will lead you into innumerable difficulties. I thanked the kind genius, in[s]tantly [s]eized the trea[s]ure, put it on my finger, and, eager to try the experiment, walked out. I'll bet you ten to one, [s]aid a noted gambler to another;---they were walking arm in arm---I'll bet you ten to one I am married before this day fortnight.--- You are a lucky dog, Cogdie, replied his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] companion, to obtain [s]o lovely a woman as Meli[s][s]a, and twenty thou[s]and pounds into the bargain. D---n the woman, [s]aid the wretch, it is money I want: by Heavens I have not five guineas left in the world, and am twice as many hundred in debt. If I do not [s]ucceed in this matrimonial [s]cheme, I [s]hall go to limbo.---There's an old prying cat of a maiden aunt [s]tands devili[s]hly in the way, or I could ea[s]ily dupe the old dad.---As to Meli[s][s]a her[s]elf, [s]he's [s]uch a mere [s]impleton in the ways of the world, that it requires but a [s]mall [s]hare of art to make her believe almo[s]t any thing. By this time they had reached the hou[s]e of the intended victim, when finding my ring had the desired effect, I entered the hou[s]e with her betrayer. His companion wi[s]hed him good morning, and I, without he[s]itation, followed him up [s]tairs. A venerable old man was [s]itting on a [s]opha; the hoary ornaments of his head in[s]pired the mind with awe, while the benignity of his countenance encouraged and invited friend[s]hip.---Be[s]ide him, reading Thom[s]on's Sea[s]ons, [s]at his daughter, lovely and blooming as Aurora, when with ro[s]y fingers on a [s]weet May morn [s]he unbars the gates of light.--- As Cogdie approached, her features were enlivened with a glow that plainly told me her heart was not her own; and the cordiality with which her father received him, evinced the integrity of his own heart, as he [s]u[s]pected not the integrity of another. After the u[s]ual compliments, the little party being [s]eated, Cogdie informed the old gentleman that he had been prevented the honor of dining with him that day by a trade[s]man to whom he owed about thirty pounds, which, as he had not lately received [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] remittances from his father, he found it inconvenient ju[s]t then to pay; that the man would take no denial, but had threatened to arre[s]t him. I mu[s]t be obliged to borrow this paltry [s]um, continued he, till I can write again to my father.---You [s]hall not be di[s]tre[s][s]ed for [s]uch a trifle, [s]aid the old gentleman, I will lend it you. He left the room to get the money, when the unfeeling Cogdie made u[s]e of that opportunity to persuade the heedle[s]s un[s]u[s]pecting Meli[s][s]a to elope. Thou art wor[s]e than a midnight ruffian, [s]aid I--- thou art [s]tealing the peace of a man who is at this moment contributing to thine. They had ju[s]t time to appoint the day, hour, and place of rendezvous, when Meli[s][s]a's father returned with the money.--- I had heard enough, and quitted the room as the old gentleman entered. That a man who has a wife and numerous family of children, and [s]ees them plunged in the deepe[s]t di[s]tre[s]s, [s]hould rob to keep them from starving, is not a matter of [s]urpri[s]e---and while [s]tern Ju[s]tice holds the balance, angel-like pity gently turns the [s]cale.---But that a man in full health and vigour, with [s]trength and abilities to [s]upport him[s]elf, who has no weeping wife or fami[s]hed children to urge him to the deed; [s]hould cozen and defraud his be[s]t friend, debauch the morals of an innocent girl, and plunge her into ruin, only to obtain a larger [s]hare of [s]ordid ore, is to me unaccountable. It is an act that makes humanity [s]hrink back agha[s]t: Ju[s]tice with [s]rowns un[s]heaths her [s]word, and pity weeps but for the offender's crimes. I will re[s]cue Meli[s][s]a, [s]aid I---[s]he may hereafter thank me. The thought filled my mind with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] unusual complacency.---I enjoyed in idea the satisfaction and gratitude of her father, when he beheld his darling re[s]cued from the jaws of de[s]truction. It was a fine evening in the month of June; [s]o removing the ring from my finger, I [s]tepped into a fruiterer's, purcha[s]ed a bottle of [s]trawberries, walked into the Park, and [s]eated my[s]elf in one of the chairs.--- My mind was at that moment a [s]ort of vacuum, my thoughts unemployed, when ca[s]ting my eyes upon the paper that covered the [s]trawberries, I perceived it was part of a fairy tale, but wrote in an uncommon poetic [s]tile. Fair Cynthia now, bright Empre[s]s of the night, Mounted her azure throne with diamonds [s]tudded; Her mode[s]t face, veil'd in a fleecy cloud. Which, as it partly hid, heighten'd her beauties. When fair Alzada, weary and forlorn, Pen[s]ive [s]at down be[s]ide a murm'ring [s]tream, With nought to [s]hield her from nocturnal dews, Saving an ancient oak, who[s]e [s]turdy boughs Had brav'd the [s]torms of many a winter pa[s]t. Her lovely head reclin'd upon her hand; Her eyes were rais'd with [s]ervour toward Heav'n. In tho[s]e bright orbs [s]tarted a pearly drop, Which, as it fell, another took its place, And that, too, fell and ki[s]s'd its plea[s]ing way In quick [s]ucce[s][s]ion down her ruby cheeks. "Ah! me," [s]he cried, "how wretched is my fate, "Forc'd from my royal parents, and my home; "What ho[s]pitable roof will now receive me, "Or where [s]hall poor Alzada lay her head. "In this lone wild I [s]ee no trace of mortals; "No lowing herds be[s]peaks a man[s]ion near; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] "No bleating flock breaks this mo[s]t [s]olemn [s]ilence; "And ere another heavy hour is pa[s]t, "Perhaps [s]ome [s]avage mon[s]ter, fierce for prey, "On me may [s]atisfy his craving hunger." The genius Abradan beheld her [s]orrows; In a plain ru[s]tic form conceal'd his own, And thus addre[s]s'd the [s]adly weeping fair. "Fair daughter of affliction, follow me; "I come to lead you to a fe[s]tive board, "Where [s]ocial mirth and innocence pre[s]ide, "And where the [s]miling ho[s]t [s]hall bid you wel- come." The trembling Prince[s]s left her mo[s][s]y [s]eat, And without [s]peaking followed her kind guide. When [s]udden clouds ob[s]cur'd the face of Heav'n; The thunders roll'd the forked lightnings fla[s]h'd, And all around was horror and amazement; Alzada [s]unk in terror to the ground. A death-like [s]woon [s]eal'd up each active [s]en[s]e. The tempe[s]t ceas'd. She rais'd her fearful eyes, And [s]aw before her a fair lofty palace: The gates were [s]olid bra[s]s; and the [s]upporters Marble, twin'd round with vine leaves wrought in gold. She enter'd, and was in[s]tantly [s]urrounded By [s]even young virgins, clad in azure blue, With alaba[s]ter va[s]es in their hands, Who paid the homage to a prince[s]s due. They [s]hed around her numberle[s]s perfumes, And o'er her threw a robe, of [s]potle[s]s white, Then led her to a room within the palace, Where, on a throne of amethy[s]t and gold, There [s]at a Monarch of maje[s]tic port; Who, ri[s]ing, welcom'd the admiring prince[s]s, And plac'd her on a [s]hining throne be[s]ide him. They brought her ba[s]kets of the choice[s]t fruits, And water from the pure[s]t limpid [s]tream. Alzada being refre[s]h'd, ro[s]e from her [s]eat, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] And thus addre[s]s'd the ma[s]ter of the fea[s]t. "Who e'er thou art, great King, who[s]e magic pow'r, "Has brought me to this place, where farthe[s]t Ind' "Seems to have empti'd her exhau[s]tle[s]s [s]tore "To add to its magnificence: "Say, can you guide a helple[s]s wand'ring maid, "To find the home where late [s]he was [s]o ble[s]t; "From whence the [s]orcere[s]s Zelubia forc'd her, "And left her parents to bewail her lo[s]s." To which the Monarch, with a [s]mile, reply'd, "Lovely Alzada, faire[s]t of thy [s]ex, "Who[s]e charms triumphant rule this royal heart, "Dry up thy tears. By this right hand I [s]wear, "Ere Phoebus harne[s][s]es his fiery [s]teeds, "And leaves his [s]ea-green couch to vi[s]it mortals, "I will conduct you to your father's court, "And guard you from the vile Zelubia's pow'r. "Slaves bring my chariot. Bid the virgins wait, "And [s]trew fre[s]h flow'rs where'er Alzada treads." The chariot was of curious workman[s]hip, Ivory, gold, coral, and precious [s]tones; Around it hover'd little laughing loves; And on each [s]ide were rang'd fair village maids, With lutes, and harps, tabors, and [s]hepherds' pipes, Singing and playing [s]oft harmonious airs. Eight milk-white [s]teeds, I turned the paper, but there was no more--- There are times when the mind is affected by mere trifles; [s]uch now was my ca[s]e---I was vexed at not finding the conclu[s]ion of the [s]tory, and determined to go back to the fruiterer's, and inquire if they had the remainder.---A few moments brought me to the place. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] A crowd was a[s][s]embled before the door. Forgetting what I came for, friend, [s]aid I---addre[s][s]ing my[s]elf to the ma[s]ter of the [s]hop, can you tell me the cau[s]e of this bu[s]tle?---It is a very extraordinary one, Sir, he replied.---A boy about ten years old, going to a [s]hop hard by to purcha[s]e [s]omething for his mother, was recollected by a trade[s]man to whom his father owed a con[s]iderable [s]um of money, and who had ju[s]t before employed a bailiff to arre[s]t him.--- The man inquired of the child where his father lived, and upon his refu[s]ing to tell, offered him money, and promi[s]ed him a great many fine things; but finding that plan equally ineffectual, he proceeded to threats. Upon which, the boy bur[s]t into tears, and [s]eating him[s]elf upon [s]ome [s]teps oppo[s]ite, declared he would [s]tay there all night rather than give them an opportunity of [s]ending his father to jail. The boy has the [s]pirit of a Roman, [s]aid I.---How many a man will feel the blu[s]h of con[s]cious guilt upon his cheek, when he [s]hall be told of this; for, Oh! [s]hame to humanity and manhood, how many would [s]ell their country through avarice, or betray it through fear.---While this magnanimous boy refuses a bribe, though poverty might induce him to take it, and dares brave the threats of an inhuman wretch, rather than betray his father, though his childhood might excu[s]e even cowardice.---I will go and [s]peak to the creditor, [s]aid I---perhaps I may per[s]uade him to drop his de[s]ign of arre[s]ting the poor man, and then I will follow the boy home. Pray , Sir, how much does this boy's father owe you? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] Eighteen pounds, replied the man. And are you really di[s]tre[s][s]ed for the money? No; thank my prudence for that; I have taken care of the main chance, and not like Heartfree, loved others more than my[s]elf. I fear you have not loved them [s]o well, my friend. Why no, to be [s]ure! I follow the fir[s]t law of nature, [s]elf-pre[s]ervation. And why not follow the fir[s]t rule of Chri[s]tianity, to do as you would be done by? Why look ye, Sir; I always pay my debts punctually, and I expect others [s]hould pay me as punctually. Certainly.---But [s]uppo[s]e a man who has an hone[s]t heart, [s]hould, by unavoidable misfortunes, be rendered unable to di[s]charge his debts; is it not better to tru[s]t to his honor, rather than by confining him, put it entirely out of his power to pay you at all? Tru[s]t to his honor---eh! you know but little of this world, to talk at that rate: why this very Heartfree was ruined by tru[s]ting to a per[s]on's honor. An old officer lodged in his hou[s]e for many years, borrowed money of him, run in his debt for linen for his whole family, and when I have talked to Heartfree about the impropriety of his conduct in not asking for payment, he would an[s]wer---I am [s]ure he will pay me whenever he has it in his power---but before it was in his power, he died, leaving four children without the lea[s]t [s]upport. The elde[s]t was about twenty; a fine young girl to be [s]ure, but [s]he had been brought up in idlene[s]s. She could embroider, draw, dance, [s]ing, and play upon the spinnet; but that would not keep her; [s]o I advi[s]ed Heartfree to try and get her a place to wait on a lady. To put the two younger girls out apprentice, and take the boy to go of errands, clean [s]hoes, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] knives, &c, in his own kitchen; but he for[s]ooth [s]aid no; the children of a man who had [s]pent his days in the [s]ervice of his country, [s]hould never want an a[s]ylum while he had a hou[s]e; nor the innocent orphans want a friend, while he lived: [s]o he married the elde[s]t, and put her [s]i[s]ters to [s]chool, were, luckily, they both died.---The boy he [s]ent to the Ea[s]t Indies about [s]even years ago, after [s]pending an enormous [s]um on his education.---His wife bred very fa[s]t, and was quite the fine lady; [s]o what with extravagance, and a few lo[s][s]es, from being one of the fir[s]t linen-drapers in the city, he is become a bankrupt, and, as I [s]uppo[s]e, has not bread to eat. And for his humanity, [s]aid I---you would reward him with a pri[s]on; rob his wife and children of their only comfort, the pre[s]ence of their father and their friend---and of what u[s]e will it be to you? I don't know that it will be of much u[s]e to me , he replied; but it will teach Heartfree to remember him[s]elf before others, another time. The remembrance of what he has done for others, [s]aid I, [s]o far from [s]itting painful on his mind, will [s]mooth the thorny pillow of di[s]tre[s]s, and make even a pri[s]on plea[s]ant; he [s]hall [s]leep [s]oundly on a bed of [s]traw, and dream of tho[s]e who[s]e [s]orrows he has lightened, while you [s]hall feel [s]corpions on a bed of down: nor [s]hall the [s]weet re[s]torer of tired nature vi[s]it you, unle[s]s it be to fright you with [s]ome dreadful vi[s]ion of pri[s]ons and [s]tarving wretches.

Go home, child, [s]aid I---your father's debt is paid. He [s]taid not to thank me; but the plea[s]ure that [s]parkled in his eye, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] the agility with which he [s]prang from his [s]eat, and flew towards his home, conveyed a greater plea[s]ure to my heart, than the mo[s]t eloquent effu[s]ions of gratitude.--- I was willing to be a witne[s]s of his relating the [s]tory to his parents; [s]o putting on my ring. I followed him un[s]een. As I a[s]cended a narrow winding [s]tair-ca[s]e, I perceived in a [s]mall room, the door of which was partly open, an elegantly-formed woman, [s]itting on the [s]ide of a wretched bed, on which lay a man, the picture of famine. On her knee [s]at a lovely infant, who with her little hand was wiping off the tears that trickled down her mother's cheeks.---The little boy, breathle[s]s with impatience, ru[s]hed into the room---Papa---Mamma---'tis paid---you [s]hall not go to pri[s]on---I would not tell where you lived; indeed he was very angry; but that good gentleman--- My dear boy, cried the fond mother, why do you talk [s]o incoherently? Who has frightened my child? What is the matter with you? He endeavoured to tell his [s]tory with propriety.--- It was in vain, joy had entirely unconnected his ideas; but he made him[s]elf under[s]tood. Oh! thou [s]en[s]uali[s]t, could[s]t thou but in imagination ta[s]te the luxury of my feelings at this moment, thou would[s]t henceforth forego the gratification of thy gro[s][s]er appetites, to fea[s]t thy mind with the highest of human plea[s]ures. I [s]aw the hone[s]t fruiterer enter with [s]ome supplies which I had judged might be nece[s][s]ary for people in their condition. He repeated every circumstance, only concealing my name.

It was more than I could conveniently afford, [s]aid I---when I found how much money I had expended Twenty pounds is a good [s]um, but it will co[s]t me much more before I have placed Heartfree in a situation more [s]uitable to his merit---but no matter, I will di[s]charge one of my [s]ervants: why [s]hould I keep two footmen, when a man of greater worth is in want of even the common nece[s][s]aries of life?--- my dear Emma will, I am [s]ure, agree to this proposal.--- My phaeton and hor[s]es, too, I will di[s]po[s]e of; one carriage is enough; what bu[s]ine[s]s have I with [s]uperfluities? the money this requires will be much better employed in relieving the unfortunate. I will be generous, but I will not be imprudent---my Emma, and her dear little Harriet, [s]hall not [s]uffer for my benevolence. I had reached my own man[s]ion; a [s]mile of chearfulness, that ever graced my Emma's face, bade me welcome. I communicated my propo[s]al, and related Heartfree's ca[s]e.---She [s]miled a[s][s]ent, and the [s]mile was rendered doubly enchanting, accompanied by the tear of [s]en[s]ibility. Retiring, I pa[s][s]ed through my Harriet's chamber--- [s]weet are the [s]lumbers of the innocent. I feasted my eyes upon her infant beauties, and retired to re[s]t with a mind [s]o [s]erene, that I envied not the greate[s]t monarch, and forgave even my bittere[s]t enemies.

The[s]e were my reflections, as I rambled towards Hamp[s]tead. Give me a draught of milk, my dear, [s]aid I, to a ro[s]y dam[s]el.---She blu[s]hed, curt[s]ied aukwardly, and complied---[s]he trembled as [s]he pre[s]ented it. Were you ever in love? [s]aid I, as I took the milk. Never but once, and plea[s]e your honor. And are you not in love now? No. No! and how happens that? I am going to be married to-morrow. And you don't think love nece[s][s]ary in matrimony? Father [s]ays I [s]hall love my hu[s]band as [s]oon as I am married, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] And pray who was you in love with? Colin; his cottage was clo[s]e by ours; we were born on the [s]ame day, and when we were children we u[s]ed to play together. If Colin had [s]ome fruit he would [s]ave a part for me; and when [s]trange gentlemen or ladies gave him half-pence, he [s]hared them with me: when we grew older, he would tend my [s]heep, watch my young lambs, and bring home my cows; and if I'd had a brother, your honor, he could not have been kinder, nor, I am [s]ure, I could not have loved him better; [s]o he axed father to let us be married; but Colin was but a [s]hepherd's boy, and I was father's only child, [s]o he [s]aid he could give me fifty pounds, and I might have a match better than Colin---[s]o we ki[s][s]ed and parted---and to-morrow I am to be married to farmer Will[s]on, who is old and lame, but he [s]ays I [s]hall have a mort of fine things---tho', to tell the truth, I had rather wear my own lin[s]ey jacket, and be married to Colin. And [s]o you [s]hall, my [s]weet [s]imple ru[s]tic, [s]aid I--- Her father was one of my tenants---I took out my pocket-book, wrote a line or two on my tablet, and bade her give it to her father. What a cur[s]e this pride is, [s]aid I, as I directed my [s]teps towards London---but that this haughty dame [s]hould [s]toop to inhabit a cottage, is wondrous [s]trange---Why a peer of the realm could but have made his daughter mi[s]erable, to pre[s]erve the dignity of his hou[s]e, but in the name of common [s]en[s]e, what has a pea[s]ant to do with pride of family? My dear friend, you are heartily welcome to town, [s]aid a [s]pruce-dre[s][s]ed citizen, as he helped his country friend to alight from the Norfolk [s]tage. Pray [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] come home with me; I expect you will make my hou[s]e your own while you [s]tay in town; there is nothing in my power I will not do to make it agreeable to you. I have depended upon your company; my whole hou[s]e is at your [s]ervice. This over-acted complai[s]ance made me [s]u[s]pect his [s]incerity, or that he had [s]ome [s]ini[s]ter point in view; [s]o putting my ring on my finger, I followed them home. I am greatly obliged to you [s]aid the country gentleman, as he [s]at down to the breakfa[s]t table; the invitation you have have given me is very acceptable; I have lo[s]t the e[s]tate I have been [s]o long at law about, for want of [s]ufficient evidence; and after I have paid the co[s]ts, I [s]hall not have more than two hundred pounds left, with which I mean to purcha[s]e an annuity; therefore I [s]hall make your hou[s]e my home, till I can [s]ettle my affairs. It may be [s]ome time before you can [s]ettle your bu[s]ine[s]s to your [s]atisfaction, replied the citizen, his features contracting into cold civility; and I expect a gentleman to take my fir[s]t floor in about a week; I am very [s]orry I cannot accommodate you longer. My dear Mr. Woollet cried the wife, ha[s]tily entering, I am va[s]tly glad to [s]ee you. Mr. Woollet has lo[s]t his law[s]uit, my dear, [s]aid the hu[s]band. The [s]mile of welcome was in[s]tantly changed into a look of amazement---She had advanced to give him her hand, but on his attempting to [s]alute her, [s]he withdrew her cheek, exclaiming I am [s]orry for his di[s]appointment---and began to make the tea. He drank two di[s]hes of tea, and then a[s]ked his friend to lend him two guineas.---He had it not in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] the hou[s]e.---Trade was very precarious---again mentioned his expected lodger, and recommended a mean room to his friend at half a crown per week, in an ob[s]cure lane in the city. Oh! [s]elf-intere[s]t, how do[s]t thou deaden every virtue; lead to hypocri[s]y and vice, and make us what we [s]hould be a[s]hamed to own, mean, avaricious, and unfeeling.---Would I change the feeling heart for all the intere[s]ted views this world affords? Oh, no! give me [s]en[s]ibility to feel another's woe, and I [s]hall then feel, as I ought, my own happine[s]s. It is vexatious, [s]aid Mr. Woollet, as he aro[s]e from breakfa[s]t, that I cannot [s]tay here, as I have no ready money to procure a lodging.---No an[s]wer was made. Can't I have a room on your [s]econd floor, Mrs. Saveall? Really, Sir, they are all occupied. I do not know what to do; I mu[s]t beg you to lend me half a guinea till next week. I cannot, upon my word, Sir. Mr. Woollet [s]ummoned up a look of expre[s][s]ive anger and contempt, and fixing his eyes on his fal[s]e friend, cried, He who can refu[s]e half a guinea to my nece[s][s]ities, [s]hall never [s]hare my pro[s]perity. Know, [s]elfish man, I have gained my cau[s]e, and am, at this moment, ma[s]ter of two thou[s]and pounds per annum. Then turning from them, ha[s]tily left the hou[s]e. I [s]tood for a moment to view their confu[s]ion; they [s]poke not a word, but giving each other the keene[s]t looks of reproach, [s]eparated in [s]ullen silence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] At that in[s]tant, Heartfree [s]hot acro[s]s my mind, I quitted the hou[s]e, and removing the ring from my finger, walked home. She was li[s]tening with attention to Heartfree, who was relating the [s]tory of la[s]t night. She knew it before, but [s]till it was plea[s]ing, for it was in prai[s]e of the man [s]he loved.---Harriet had made an acquaintance with my little petitioner; was displaying her toys, and teaching her to dre[s]s her doll. I have made you wait, my Emma, [s]aid I---Heartfree ro[s]e from his [s]eat, bowed, and ca[s]t down his eyes, while his cheeks were dyed with crim[s]on---it was a blu[s]h neither expre[s][s]ive of guilt nor [s]hame---it was a blu[s]h occa[s]ioned only by the pain a noble heart feels when in a [s]tate of de[s]pondence. I took no notice of it, but began a conver[s]ation on indifferent [s]ubjects---his confu[s]ion gradually decrea[s]ed, and in le[s]s than half an hour was quite di[s][s]ipated. I [s]ettled a plan for his future [s]ub[s]i[s]tence---he left me in ha[s]te to carry the joyful tidings to his wife--- he was beyond expre[s][s]ion happy, nor was I a jot behind him in that particular.---My Harriet could not part with her little play-fellow.---She [s]hall live with you, Harriet, [s]aid I;---[s]o [s]he [s]hall, papa, and ride in my coach, and wear my fine things---won't you, Lucy? She looked up at me with a countenance I [s]hall never forget. And [s]hall I never [s]ee mamma, then? and mu[s]t [s]he [s]till live in that dark room? I was willing to try her.---You [s]hall [s]tay here, Lucy, [s]aid I, but you mu[s]t not [s]ee your mamma, nor can I help her living in that little dark room. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] She [s]urveyed the apartment [s]he was in, as though making a compari[s]on. It is a fine place, [s]aid [s]he; but if my mamma cannot take a part of the[s]e fine things, I had rather go home again. Oh! exclaimed Emma, who can [s]ay that Heartfree is poor; fate has indeed robbed him of his wealth, but Heaven in return has given him an invaluable trea[s]ure in his children. It was about two years after, when my Emma, Harriet, Lucy, and my[s]elf, were on a vi[s]it to Heartfree.--- His brother had returned from India with a fortune equal to their mo[s]t [s]anguine wi[s]hes.---In rural retirement, about twenty miles from London, they lived in complete happine[s]s, having been taught the value of pre[s]ent ble[s][s]ings, by pa[s]t [s]cenes of sorrow. It was a night when the contending elements [s]eemed to threaten the earth with di[s][s]olution; the forked lightening rived the [s]turdy oaks; the bur[s]ting and almo[s]t ince[s][s]ant peals of thunder made all nature tremble. The whirlwind raged, the gleaming meteors [s]hewed the di[s]tant foaming [s]ea, its proud un[s]ettled waves that [s]eemed to wage war with the black impending [s]ky.---It was a night of horror. It was a night to make a man remember on what a [s]lender thread his life depends. The va[s]t univer[s]e is but an atom that with one bla[s]t from the Creative Power might vani[s]h into air, and leave no trace of planets, earth, or [s]ea, but all again be univer[s]al chaos. It cea[s]ed. The moon broke from behind a jetty cloud, tinged round with [s]ilver---the wind pa[s][s]ed gently over the trees and herbage, who[s]e leaves had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] caught the late de[s]cending [s]hower, and glittered in the moon beams. The tempe[s]t was dreadful, [s]aid I, but it has cleared the air of all noxious vapours; and how beautiful appears the face of nature, heightened by the remembrance of the late [s]cene of horror!---Ju[s]t [s]o it is with life; none can enjoy the plea[s]ures of prosperity [s]o well as tho[s]e who have felt the pangs of adver[s]ity. Our ears were invaded by a groan; it came from the road; we followed the [s]ound, and found a man lying on the ground, bleeding, and almo[s]t naked.--- We bore him to the hou[s]e, his wounds were dre[s][s]ed, and it was judged re[s]t would be his be[s]t re[s]torer. In the morning he was unable to ri[s]e. I propo[s]ed to Heartfree to vi[s]it him; we entered the room, put back the curtains, and di[s]covered the features of the inhuman Creditor.---We pau[s]ed.---He endeavoured to turn his face from us, and waving his hand for us to leave him, cried emphatically, Heartfree! thou art revenged. I [s]hould like to know, [s]aid Heartfree, when his wounded gue[s]t was able to leave his apartment, by what accident you came in that dangerous [s]ituation. I will inform you, he replied:---About three weeks [s]ince, my hou[s]e was con[s]umed by fire, and with it all my property---my wife and children were [s]aved, but they were [s]aved from the flames to peri[s]h by famine. His heart was full.---Heartfree pa[s][s]ed his hand across his eyes.---The man continued.---Some charitable people made a collection of near fifty pounds, and advi[s]ed me to go into the country, and purcha[s]e a little place where my wife and children might be [s]upported by indu[s]try.---To [s]ave expences I travelled on foot, and in a late tempe[s]t [s]topt at an ale hou[s]e till it [s]hould be over. On coming away, two men [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] offered to accompany me; but before I had proceeded far, they [s]topped and demanded my money; [s]eeing they had no fire arms, I endeavoured to defend myself, but they were too powerful; I received a wound in my [s]ide and [s]oon grew in[s]en[s]ible; the re[s]t you know.---I return you many thanks for the unmerited favours I have received; but I mu[s]t now go back to my poor family, and either [s]tarve in obscurity, or go to the pari[s]h. You [s]hall do neither, exclaimed Heartfree, looking at his own children as he [s]poke. Heartfree was a hu[s]band and a father in the ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of the words.---He was troubled with a [s]hort memory, and had entirely forgot that he had ever been har[s]hly treated by the per[s]on before him. You [s]hall do neither, [s]aid he, taking out his pocket book, and endeavouring to di[s]per[s]e the drops of humanity that [s]tarted in his eye: here, giving him a note, here is a trifle; I do not at pre[s]ent want; when you can [s]pare it, repay me; till then you are welcome. The man could not take it---a[s]toni[s]hment had rendered him motionle[s]s. Heartfree put it on the table, and calling to a servant to get a hor[s]e ready for his gue[s]t to return to town, wi[s]hed him a plea[s]ant ride, and left the room. I fear this [s]tep will greatly di[s]tre[s]s my poor father, [s]aid Meli[s][s]a to her woman, as they entered the Park. They had left the carriage at Spring Gardens, with orders if they did not return in two hours, to go home. Mrs. Tiffany was artful; [s]he knew her lady's partiality for Cogdie, and [s]he painted the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] matrimonial [s]tate, founded on love, in the mo[s]t glowing colours. Meli[s][s]a for a moment forgot her father, but the idea [s]oon returned. I hope he will not be very wretched, [s]aid [s]he. You will [s]oon return, an[s]wered Mrs. Tiffany. But I marry without con[s]ulting him. And is not your fortune your own, Madam; and in a ca[s]e of this nature, young ladies can certainly tell what will contribute to their own happine[s]s, better than their old fathers can judge for them. But he will be very angry, Tiffany---I will not go---I will return, fall at his feet, and confe[s]s my error---I am [s]ure he will refu[s]e me nothing that is really nece[s][s]ary to my happine[s]s. Dear madam, how can you talk [s]o---what will poor Mr. Cogdie think? he will certainly go distracted. Meli[s][s]a [s]topped. And then your aunt Sarah, [s]he will never let you have Mr. Cogdie if [s]he can prevent it. No matter; I will not go. Well, madam, ju[s]t as you plea[s]e; Mr. Cogdie will think you meant to make a fool of him, and will marry Mi[s]s Sparkle, who is [s]o fond of him. Meli[s][s]a [s]ighed---and went forward. A chai[s]e and four was waiting for her at Hydepark Corner; I had a hor[s]e there ready al[s]o.---By means of my ring I had followed them through the Park un[s]een---I now took it off, and mounting my hor[s]e, followed the chai[s]e full [s]peed, in which were Cogdie, Meli[s][s]a, and her woman. I have often heard of this place, [s]aid I, but I never thought I [s]hould be one that took a trip to it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] on an hymeneal expedition;---but I mu[s]t not lo[s]e [s]ight of Meli[s][s]a; [s]o putting on my ring, I followed them into the hou[s]e. How happy your conde[s]cen[s]ion makes me, [s]aid Cogdie, as he [s]eated him[s]elf by Meli[s][s]a---but I [s]hall not be entirely devoid of fear till I can call you mine: and as the Par[s]on is not in the way, [s]uppo[s]e, my dear girl, you [s]ign this paper, to certify that you came with me voluntarily, in ca[s]e I [s]hould be called to an account for running away with an Heire[s]s. May I not read the paper, [s]aid Meli[s][s]a. It is of no great con[s]equence, my love, whether you [s]ign it or not, only in [s]uch ca[s]es there are sometimes difficulties en[s]ue after the ceremony is over. I may be tried and ca[s]t. Give me the paper, I will [s]ign it. I trembled with anxiety.---She had taken up the pen to [s]ign the conveyance of her whole fortune into his hands. I will [s]ee him---exclaimed a voice, not the gentlest in the world---I have a warrant to apprehend him. Cogdie turned pale as a[s]hes.---The pen dropped from Meli[s][s]a's hand.--- An officer of ju[s]tice entered. Mr. Cogdie, [s]aid he, you mu[s]t go with me. I arre[s]t you for a fraud committed five years ago. And who has employod you? who forged this tale to injure me in the opinion of this lady? I had taken off my ring, and [s]tepping forward at that moment, cried, 'tis I, you villain. Is it not enough that you have ruined an innocent girl who was under my protection; left her and her helple[s]s infant to [s]hame and want, and by ba[s]e and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] fraudulent methods taken from me near a thou[s]and pounds, but you mu[s]t add to the catalogue of your crimes the ruin of this amiable lady, and break the heart of her worthy father. Meli[s][s]a [s]hrieked, and fainted; I caught her as [s]he fell, and bore her in my arms to another apartment.--- Cogdie departed with the officers of justice, muttering cur[s]es as he went. O! where am I, cried Meli[s][s]a, as [s]he opened her eyes, and where is my dear father? Safe, I hope, replied I; and when you choo[s]e, I will order a chai[s]e and we will return to him. When you plea[s]e, Sir; but I fear he will never [s]ee me, never forgive me; I dare not go to him. I will make your peace with him, [s]aid I.---Melissa bur[s]t into tears, and was [s]ilent. We cannot depart without [s]ome refre[s]hment, thought I; [s]o going into the kitchen to order something, I met Mrs. Tiffany on the [s]tairs. Woman, [s]aid I, what wages does your lady owe you? Six months, Sir; but I hope my lady will not part with me in this [s]trange place? You had no bu[s]ine[s]s to advi[s]e her to come to this [s]trange place---there is your money, and three guineas to pay your expences to town, your lady never de[s]ires to [s]ee you again.---Now by the a[s]toni[s]hment of her countenance, and a [s]ort of leer that [s]he gave as [s]he tripped down [s]tairs, I gue[s][s]ed I had paid her more than was her due. This Woman has certainly got more than [s]he had a right to, [s]aid I, [s]tanding with my right hand on the top of the lower balu[s]trade, and holding my pur[s]e, which I had not yet tied up, in my left---The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] world talks much about hone[s]ty, but I cannot comprehend where it is to be found.---The trader will [s]tand behind his counter, and a[s]k you three [s]hillings per yard for cloth more than it is worth, and if you are inexperienced, as it frequently happens in [s]uch ca[s]es, you pay him without he[s]itation---he knows he has impo[s]ed upon you, yet he will lay his hand upon his heart, and declare he is an hone[s]t man.--- The Courtier---Oh! quoth reflection, pray don't mention a courtier and hone[s]ty in the [s]ame breath.--- The women---how can you talk of their hone[s]ty, when you have [s]o flagrant a proof to the contrary before you.---The Clergy---wor[s]e and wor[s]e; does not the beneficed clergyman, quietly pocket his hundreds, or thou[s]ands, while the poor curate is [s]tarving on thirty pounds per annum, and will not the rector preach you an eloquent [s]ermon on charity, and the curate [s]pend his breath in recommending ab[s]tinence.--- Is this hone[s]ty? It may be called [s]o, [s]aid I. The lawyer and phy[s]ician---Oh, there is no honesty there, I a[s][s]ure you; the one [s]teals your fortune, and the other your life---but this is all in the way of bu[s]ine[s]s. Then pray where may we find this [s]aid hone[s]ty? It was a [s]ort of que[s]tion I knew not how to answer--- at that in[s]tant faithful Cae[s]ar came and licked my hand.---You are right, [s]aid I, patting his head. If any thing like hone[s]ty or fidelity is to be found in the world, it is in your [s]pecies. Shall we go, Sir, [s]aid Meli[s][s]a, as [s]he came down [s]tairs. With all my heart, [s]aid I, putting up my pur[s]e, and offering her my hand.---The chai[s]e was at the door, and I was actually [s]topping in to it, without once recollecting that I had not [s]pent a [s]ingle half-penny for the good of the hou[s]e.

I will tell you, Madam, [s]aid I---[s]he was all attention. Five years [s]ince, a friend of mine died and left a lovely orphan daughter to my care.---Olivia was young and inexperienced in the ways of the world.--- I was gay and fond of company---the hou[s]e of a young gentleman of fortune is not a fit [s]anctuary for innocence and beauty. I loved Olivia like a [s]i[s]ter--- I would have revenged an in[s]ult offered her at the expen[s]e of my life, but [s]he required the tender solicitude of a mother, the [s]edate mature advice of a father.--- Her heart was the [s]eat of [s]en[s]ibility, [s]he was formed for dome[s]tic love and felicity---having no paternal ties, no filial affection to warm her gentle brea[s]t---there was an aching void in her heart, which only love could fill.---Cogdie vi[s]ited at my hou[s]e---he was much older than Olivia, [s]he was only [s]ixteen.---He was attentive to her childi[s]h pleasures; her favourite dog was care[s][s]ed---he would feed her Goldfinch, talk to her parrot, and bring her no[s]egays.---I was not of a [s]u[s]picious temper, but placed an implicit confidence in Cogdie, who, by a thou[s]and arts, had ingratiated him[s]elf into my favour. It was not long before I ob[s]erved Olivia grew pale and thin; [s]he had lo[s]t her chearfulne[s]s, and I frequently found her in tears. Imagining [s]he might be [s]olitary for want of a female companion, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] proposed her going into the country to an old lady, a friend of mine, who had a daughter but three years older than her[s]elf---[s]he con[s]ented, and two days after was appointed for her departure. When the appointed morning came, [s]he was not to be found. I [s]ent to all her acquaintance in vain.---I cannot describe my di[s]tre[s]s---I told my affliction to Cogdie; he con[s]oled me, and flattered me with hopes I might yet find her---I was happy to think I had [s]uch a friend. Three weeks pa[s][s]ed on, and I never heard of my Olivia---Cogdie had frequently mentioned his being [s]ometimes employed by a capital merchant at Hamburgh, with whom I was acquainted when abroad--- He came to me one morning and [s]hewed a letter in which he was de[s]ired to [s]end the merchant a ring, the mo[s]t valuable that could be procured.--- I wonder, [s]aid Cogdie, why he has not [s]ent me the money to purcha[s]e this ring; he knows my circumstances are not the mo[s]t affluent. He [s]eemed distressed at not being able to get [s]o valuable a ring on credit.---I [s]ent him to my jeweller; the ring was ordered, and it came to near eight hundred and fifty pounds---he took it away in ha[s]te one morning, as he [s]aid, to [s]end it to Hamburgh; and I never [s]aw him again, till a few days [s]ince, when I was informed he was one of the mo[s]t noted gamblers about town. I had given up all thoughts of ever finding Olivia, when going out one evening--- The roads are very heavy indeed, [s]aid I, breaking the thread of my [s]tory, and fixing my eyes on an old man, who was travelling through the dirt--- There had ju[s]t fallen a heavy [s]hower of rain, and the [s]un was now [s]hining with [s]corching rays upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] his head; he was dre[s][s]ed in a gray coat, and a bundle hung to the end of a [s]tick that was acro[s]s his shoulder.--- My heart is always intere[s]ted by the pre[s]ent object.---This man, [s]aid I, is no more able to walk than I am; and four hor[s]es can certainly drag three people---I bade the po[s]tilion [s]top.---And what are you about to do? [s]aid Prudence---Offer that poor man a [s]eat in the chai[s]e, [s]aid Benevolence---ah! but you know nothing of him; he may be a thief, cried Su[s]picion---or a very poor mechanic, and by no means fit to ride in a chai[s]e with a gentleman, urged Pride---but he is a fellow-creature, and [s]eems very weary, [s]aid Humanity.---I [s]tayed not another moment for con[s]ideration. And have you never heard of Olivia [s]ince? [s]aid Meli[s][s]a, when we were [s]ettled in our [s]eats.---I know not how it was, but I could not proceed with my [s]tory---there was [s]omething in the appearance of the old man, that awakened my curio[s]ity---he was a figure not [s]triking; but examine it minutely, and you would find it intere[s]ting. A few gray hairs were [s]cattered over his forehead; his face [s]eemed to have [s]ome traces of [s]orrow and di[s]appointment; his features were grave, but withal tempered with [s]uch meek re[s]ignation and compo[s]ure, that I contemplated them till I had forgot Olivia, Meli[s][s]a, and almost my[s]elf. There is [s]uch a natural curio[s]ity implanted in the mind of man, that we cannot be half an hour in company with a [s]tranger, before in our own imagination we form many conjectures concerning his [s]ituation in life---what [s]ort of a di[s]po[s]ition he has--- whether he is married or [s]ingle---and fifty [s]uch particulars, which are of no real con[s]equence to us.---I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] had not been [s]eated with this old man above ten minutes, when I had [s]ettled in my own mind that he was a par[s]on, that he had lo[s]t his wife, and that he was going to town in order to look out for [s]ome employment to [s]ettle his children in.---Thou ha[s]t lo[s]t thy partner, thought I, looking at him with compassion who has heightened the plea[s]ure of thy youth, [s]hared with thee the [s]weets and bitters of life, and was thy companion in old age.---The bower that [s]he planted [s]o many years [s]ince; the woodbines that [s]he trimmed and guided with her hands, now [s]hoot wild and neglected, and that bower which to thee was once a paradi[s]e, is now de[s]olate and gloomy, deprived of her pre[s]ence.---What a fancy baggage is this Madam Fancy, [s]aid I, recollecting my[s]elf; [s]he has given me a pain at my heart by telling me a tale which, perhaps, has no foundation.--- Do not complain of Fancy, [s]aid my fellow traveller, for how many a heavy hour [s]he often helps to di[s][s]ipate, when [s]he [s]oars upon the pinions of hope, and builds fine airy fabrics, extricates us out of difficulties, and leads us to the [s]ummit of our wi[s]hes; and we are for the moment as happy as tho' in the real po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of them; and what tho [s]he [s]ometimes does for[s]ake us, and all the pro[s]pects vani[s]h into air, yet [s]oon [s]he returns again, and again is welcomed--- we li[s]ten to her [s]iren tale with plea[s]ure, and [s]o wear life away. How often in fancy have I ru[s]hed into battle, and with this arm [s]ent hundreds to eternity--- how often has fancy led me to my [s]overeign's feet to receive the reward of my pa[s]t [s]ervices. You are a [s]oldier, then, [s]aid, I,---every feature was animated with the remembrance of former campaigns, as he replied in the affirmative. Then by my [s]oul, [s]aid I madam Fancy is an arrant cheat, for [s]he had repre[s]ented you as a par[s]on. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] I have [s]pent the be[s]t part of my life, [s]aid the old man, in the [s]ervice of my country.---At fifty years of age I retired, with no other fortune than a lieutenant's half pay---it was but [s]canty, it was but [s]ufficient for the wants of Narci[s][s]a, my wife, and [s]elf.---I would tell you that my child was lovely, Sir, but I am old, and a father; both tho[s]e particulars would lead you to doubt my veracity. Our mansion was [s]mall, but it was the man[s]ion of content. La[s]t [s]ummer an old lady came to lodge in our neighbourhood; [s]he took great notice of Narci[s][s]a during her re[s]idence in the country, and at her departure requested me to let my child come the en[s]uing [s]pring to pa[s]s a few weeks in town; with reluctance I con[s]ented, for I thought the fair blo[s][s]om of innocence would be [s]ubject to contamination if I entru[s]ted her in the metropolis without a proper protector. You was right, [s]aid I---at that in[s]tant recollecting poor Olivia, and fearing I might again lo[s]e the thread of my [s]tory, I in[s]tantly gratified Meli[s][s]a's curiosity, by relating the remainder. Going out one evening, I heard a voice which I thought I knew, imploring charity. I [s]ent my servant to bring her to me; [s]he came weeping and sobbing aloud.---She ju[s]t entered the door, and [s]unk insensible at my [s]eet.---It was poor Olivia---I rai[s]ed her, I pre[s][s]ed her in my arms, and by the tendere[s]t care[s][s]es called her back to life. When [s]he found her[s]elf in my arms, [s]he could hardly tru[s]t her [s]en[s]es, but [s]liding from my embrace upon her knees, took both my hands in hers, and cried will you forgive me.---I a[s][s]ured her [s]he was pardoned; [s]oothed her and begged to know why [s]he had left my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] protection---[s]he unfolded a tale of horror---Cogdie had ruined her. She found her[s]elf pregnant, and pre[s][s]ed him to marry her; he [s]aid I would not confent to their union, and when out of tenderne[s]s I wi[s]hed to remove her into the country, [s]he thought it was only to take her from him.---Con[s]cious of her own unhappy [s]ituation, [s]he flew to her betrayer---he for a while behaved with a tolerable degree of tenderne[s]s; but he [s]oon threw off the di[s]gui[s]e, and turned her out of doors, at the [s]ame time informing her that I had taken an oath never to [s]ee or a[s][s]i[s]t her. Heavens! what barbarity, exclaimed Meli[s][s]a.--- Meli[s][s]a pitied Olivia, but [s]he felt for her[s]elf---it might have been her [s]ituation.---She de[s]ired me to proceed. I took the fair mourner, [s]aid I, into the country, where, in about [s]ix weeks, [s]he was delivered of a boy.---I told her unfortunate tale to Mrs Sidley and her daughter; they pitied her, they determined [s]he [s]hould not be lo[s]t. I vi[s]ited Olivia in her retreat; my vi[s]its were long and frequent; when I was absent from Sidley Cot, I was pen[s]ive and unhappy; my former plea[s]ures lo[s]t the power of amu[s]ing---in [s]hort, I at la[s]t di[s]covered that the lovely Emma Sidley had taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my heart; I [s]ought her hand---I gained it, and brought my charming prize triumphant up to town. Olivia has [s]pent the[s]e la[s]t five years in superintending the care of her boy; [s]he pa[s][s]es for a widow, and her charms have gained her many admirers, but [s]he declines them all; and declares [s]he looks upon her[s]elf as the wife of Cogdie. Chance di[s]covered to me his vile de[s]ign on you. Pardon me, dear lady, if I thought the method I have made u[s]e of, the only one that I could impre[s]s your mind with terror, at the precipice you have e[s]caped, and guard you in future again[s]t forming clande[s]tine connections with our [s]ex.

[s]aid my Emma, when I had given her an account of our journey. I [s]et him down [s]omewhere in the Strand, [s]aid I. I hope you found [s]ome opportunity to increa[s]e his little [s]tore, without hurting his feelings, [s]aid [s]he. I was a[s]hamed to own my omi[s][s]ion; and yet where is the [s]hame? [s]aid I, as I [s]at with my hand upon my Emma's knee, reading the [s]weet lines written by benevolence on her lovely countenance.--- Where is the [s]hame that I was guilty of an omi[s][s]ion through forgetfulne[s]s? it was not a wilful [s]in again[s]t charity---I will go [s]eek him, [s]aid I, and repair my fault. You will fir[s]t go to my father, I hope, [s]aid Melissa. I took my hat, and [s]tood full two minutes undetermined which to do fir[s]t---they were both actions of benevolence. Had it been thy ca[s]e, bright pattern of humanity, [s]aid I, opening a volume of Sterne, that lay on the table before me, ju[s]t at the corporal's relating the [s]tory of Le Fevre to Captain Shandy---had it been thy ca[s]e, thou would'[s]t have given the preference to the old [s]oldier; but I am a father, and will act as my feelings direct. It is of no purpo[s]e, [s]aid I, to the [s]ervant, to deny your ma[s]ter; I am [s]ure he is at home, and I will [s]ee him---pray tell him I have particular business with him.---I had left Meli[s][s]a at my hou[s]e--- after waiting half an hour, I was admitted up [s]tairs--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] Meli[s][s]a's father was [s]itting in a pen[s]ive po[s]ture, his looks dejected, and his dre[s]s di[s]ordered.---On the other [s]ide of the room [s]at a woman, the picture of envy and ill-nature. You will pardon me, Sir, for this intru[s]ion---I came from--- My daughter, eagerly exclaimed the old gentleman--- and where is [s]he, Sir?---will [s]he come home again? Oh, lead me to her, that I may lock her in my arms, and with tears of joy wa[s]h away the remembrance of her error. I [s]uppo[s]e Mi[s]s is married, cried Mrs. Sarah.--- She did not make [s]uch an excur[s]ion, and with [s]uch company, for nothing. Really, Madam, [s]aid I, [s]he is not married; [s]he has taken a little excur[s]ion it is true, but [s]he is now at my hou[s]e, impatiently waiting for a [s]ummons to throw her[s]elf at her father's feet, and implore his forgivene[s]s.---The old gentleman called for his hat. Why [s]urely you will not forgive her, brother? [s]aid the churli[s]h aunt. Not forgive her! exclaimed the father---I tell you, [s]i[s]ter, [s]he [s]hall be forgiven, taken again to my bo[s]om, again [s]hare my confidence; nor be driven by my unkindne[s]s, and the cold contempt of her own [s]ex to that vice which I know her [s]oul would [s]hrink from as from death. Mrs. Sarah muttered [s]omething about virtue and propriety, and left the room. There were three rea[s]ons why Mrs. Sarah was [s]o inveterate again[s]t her niece; the fir[s]t was was, [s]he was old, very [s]allow rather inclined to be crooked, and had a voice [s]omething re[s]embling the cawing of a rook; it was therefore a great mortification to have a niece [s]o young and lovely. In the [s]econd place, [s]he had formed [s]ome de[s]ign [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] on Cogdie's heart her[s]elf---no woman can bear a rival in love or dre[s]s. The third, and mo[s]t potent rea[s]on was, [s]he had never been a parent, therefore could not tell the pangs, the yearnings, the fond [s]olicitudes that by turns agitated the heart of Meli[s][s]a's father. Come, let us go, my friend, [s]aid he, let us go and bring the dear fugitive home. As we were going, I gave him an account of our expedition. I cannot bear to [s]ee him, exclaimed Meli[s][s]a, hiding her face as we entered---He would not [s]uffer her to kneel, but embracing her cordially, cried, Come home, my child, come home, and let us forget all that is pa[s]t, I never will reproach you. He was right in making this promi[s]e, for nothing is [s]o liable to drive a woman to a [s]econd error, as her being [s]ubject to continual reproach for the fir[s]t. I wonder, thought I, as they departed, if there is a geater ble[s][s]ing on this [s]ide eternity, than the power of conferring benefits.---The man who has it in his power to make others happy, has a large [s]hare of happine[s]s allotted to him[s]elf.---I would not part with my ring [s]aid I for half the univer[s]e; without it I had been unable to deliver this charming girl from the hands of her betrayer. And can that young creature be an author? [s]aid I--- [s]he was [s]tanding at the door of the printing office, waiting for admi[s][s]ion.---I had rambled out that morning in [s]earch of adventures---my ring was on, I entered the office with the young author. I have brought you my manu[s]cript, Mr. C---ke, [s]aid [s]he; the [s]tory is founded on fact, and, I hope, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] will be [s]o lucky as to plea[s]e tho[s]e who [s]hall hereafter peru[s]e it. Is it original, Mi[s]s? Entirely [s]o. Lord ble[s]s me! that was quite unnece[s][s]ary. Why, Sir, how could I think of offering to the public a [s]tory which has appeared in print before? Nothing more common, I a[s][s]ure you. He was a thin, pale looking man, dre[s][s]ed in a [s]habby green coat---he never looked in her face the whole time; he was [s]peaking, but [s]tanding half [s]ideways towards her, fixed his eyes a[s]kance upon the ground.---I never like a man that is a[s]hamed to look me in the face, it argues a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of not having always acted with integrity. Nothing can be more common, Mi[s]s, continued he, than for an author to get a quantity of old magazines, the older the better, and having picked and culled tho[s]e [s]tories the mo[s]t adapted for his purpo[s]e, he places them in a little regular order, writes a line here and there, and [s]o offers them to the public as an entire new work. See, here, now, I have publi[s]hed this work on my own account; the[s]e few fir[s]t pages are original, but I a[s][s]ure you the [s]ci[s][s]ars did the re[s]t. I have entitled it The Morali[s]t, and [s]ell the[s]e two volumes at [s]even [s]hillings and [s]ixpence. I [s]hould rather call that compiling, [s]aid the young author. Why [s]o it is, in fact---but I a[s][s]ure you there are few people who have genius [s]ufficient to write a book, or even if they had, would take the trouble to do it.--- A [s]entimental novel will hardly pay you for time and paper.---A [s]tory full of intrigue, wrote with levity, and tending to convey loo[s]e ideas, would [s]ell very well. It is a [s]ubject unfit for a female pen, [s]aid the young lady.

It is a [s]ubject unfit for any pen, retorted [s]he, a deep vermilion dying her cheeks, and fire fla[s]hing from her eyes---[s]he [s]topped, and checked her ri[s]ing pa[s][s]ion---I think, Sir, [s]he continued, with more compo[s]ure, the per[s]on who would write a book that might tend to corrupt the morals of youth, and fill their docile minds with ideas pernicious and destructive to their happine[s]s, de[s]erves a greater punishment than the robber who [s]teals your pur[s]e, or the murderer that takes your life. Mr. C---ke [s]tared---it was a vacant [s]tare---he wondered, no doubt, how an author could [s]tudy any thing but her own emolument---I was plea[s]ed with her [s]entiments---if your writings are equal to what you have ju[s]t uttered, [s]aid I, they will be worth perusing; but [s]ome can talk better than they write; perhaps it is her ca[s]e. Her works never fell in my way, [s]o I cannot judge.--- You mean to publi[s]h by [s]ub[s]cription, [s]aid Mr. C---ke---She replied in the affirmative--- And how do you mean to get [s]ub[s]cribers? \---By [s]hewing my propo[s]als, and [s]imply requesting them to encourage my undertakings. Oh! God ble[s]s me, he replied, [s]till looking askance, for he never changed his po[s]ition, or rai[s]ed his eyes from the ground, except it was to look at his elbow, and contemplate his thread-bare [s]leeve---It will never do to go that way to work---you mu[s]t have a tale of di[s]tre[s]s to tell, or you will never procure one [s]ub[s]criber--- I am not very much di[s]tre[s][s]ed, [s]aid [s]he; and if I was, why [s]hould I blazon it to the world? It is no matter whether you are really di[s]tre[s][s]ed or not, [s]aid C---ke; but you mu[s]t tell a tale to excite pity, or you will never gain a [s]ingle [s]hilling towards printing your books---I have [s]old eight hundred [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] copies of the Morali[s]t by the[s]e means---nobody gives them[s]elves the trouble to enquire whether my [s]tory be fal[s]e or true; it excites pity for the moment--- they [s]end me a [s]ub[s]cription---my purpo[s]e is answered, and 'tis a que[s]tion whether they ever think of me or my [s]tory again--- She [s]eemed tired of the conver[s]ation---[s]o laying down her manu[s]cript, and de[s]iring him to put it in hand immediately, [s]he bade him good morning--- What impo[s]itions there are in the world!

Two coaches with white plumes; in the fir[s]t was the co[s][s]in of an infant at the door of an elegant hou[s]e [s]tood [s]everal dome[s]tics weeping---A young woman who had [s]tood at a di[s]tance, watched the coaches till they were out of [s]ight and then bur[s]t into tears--- I removed my ring from my finger, and inquired the cau[s]e of her grief. He is gone, Sir, [s]aid [s]he, pointing to the road the coaches had taken; he is gone, and I [s]hall never fee him again; he was the [s]weete[s]t child---I once lived with him, I loved him with un[s]peakable tenderne[s]s, li[s]tened with plea[s]ure to his prattle, and when he was ill, attended him with anxious, unremitting care; he was the delight of his parents, he was the joy of my heart. You do wrong to lament, [s]aid I; he is gone to a more happy place; he is taken away before he had offended his Maker, to [s]hare in plea[s]ures unspeakable and uncea[s]ing; then why [s]hould you make yourself wretched? It is like regretting that he was not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] [s]uffered to remain in a world [s]ubject to all [s]orts of di[s]appointments and mis[s]ortunes; he is now an angel in the man[s]ions of the ble[s][s]ed: why [s]hould you then mourn his ab[s]ence from you? Have you children, Sir? [s]aid [s]he, with unaffected [s]implicity---The que[s]tion [s]truck me forcibly. I thus a[s]ked my own heart---had Harriet been taken from me, could I have rea[s]oned thus calmly; the very [s]uppo[s]ition gave me an un[s]peakable pang; it told me that rea[s]on had little power over the heart torn by the lo[s]s of what it prized more than life.--- I turned to the young woman---[s]he was gone a few paces from me---[s]he [s]ighed, profoundly pronounced the name of Henry, wiped off her tears, rai[s]ed her [s]wollen eyes to Heaven and cried---Thy will be done. I was a[s]hamed of my former rea[s]oning; that one [s]entence convinced me, that chri[s]tianity was a better comforter in affliction than the mo[s]t boa[s]ted rules of philo[s]ophy. It was a neat little hou[s]e, by the [s]ide of the fields--- a pretty looking woman, dre[s]t by [s]implicity, Nature's handmaid, was laying the table cloth and trimming up her little parlour; her looks were chearful and [s]erene, and with a voice plea[s]ing, though wild and untutored, [s]he [s]ung the following little [s]tanzas: Here, beneath my humble cot, Tranquil peace and plea[s]ure dwell; If contented with our lot, Smiling joy can grace a cell.

And [s]o you are writing---and do you intend to publi[s]h your works? Perhaps I may, [s]aid I--- What is your [s]ubject, pray? Rambles, excur[s]ions, characters, and tales. And do you think the world will attend to your rambles, excur[s]ions, characters, and tales?

And the only one I [s]hall ever write, [s]aid I---for if in this va[s]t globe full of intere[s]ting [s]cenes to excite our wonder and engage our attention, if, I [s]ay, in [s]uch a place a man cannot u[s]e his pen without stabbing the character of his neighbour, he mu[s]t have had a very narrow education, be po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of a bad heart, and ble[s][s]ed with little or no under[s]tanding.

A nut-brown maid, dre[s][s]ed in pure white, the emblem of her own innocence, pre[s]ided at the head of the board---I looked at her with [s]crutinizing eye, and perceived it was my pretty milk-maid---She had that day given her hand to Colin, and the chearful company were a[s][s]embled to keep the wedding. Their repa[s]t fini[s]hed, a lad with a pipe and labor, and another with a fiddle, [s]truck up a lively air, when Colin and his Ro[s]e led off the dance, with [s]tep [s]o light, a countenance [s]o [s]erene, and an air [s]o blythe, that I wi[s]hed my[s]elf an humble villager, and my Emma a nut-brown maid.

A petticoat is a pretty ornament, [s]aid I--- and [s]o is an apron---The dancers had tucked their aprons up on one [s]ide---it gave them a look of ea[s]e and negligence. It is [s]trange, [s]aid I, that among all the caprices of fa[s]hion the apron has never been totally aboli[s]hed, but has continued to be worn by all ranks and degrees of women, from our grandmother Eve, down to the[s]e dancing dam[s]els. It had never [s]truck me before that the apron was an ornament of [s]uch antiquity. They danced till [s]ilver Cynthia lighted up the horizon, and then all with one con[s]ent [s]at down to [s]upper.

The one was a young man of fortune, a pro[s]e[s][s]ed libertine. The other an old, fat woman, who[s]e looks and ge[s]tures be[s]poke her employment. I thought I could read in the open countenance of the young lady an uncon[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of guilt, and a full confidence in the company and protection of her companions---I was determined to be convinced whether my conjectures were well founded. When they left the playhou[s]e I put on my ring and followed them; they were [s]et down at the door of an elegant hou[s]e; the rooms within were [s]uperb, the furniture grand, and the [s]ervants numerous--- Supper was [s]erved up---they urged the young lady to drink [s]everal gla[s][s]es of wine--- She complied with reluctance. I will go and order the coach, [s]aid the old woman, and left the room.

If I was clever at de[s]igning I would give you a [s]ketch of this [s]cene. The libertine at the [s]ound of my voice relinquished his prey, and fixed his eyes on me in [s]ilent astonishment, while every feature expre[s][s]ed terror and di[s]may. Half [s]tarting from his [s]eat, he exclaimed, in a voice [s]carcely articulate, Who are you?

I don't under[s]tand this in[s]olence, replied [s]he; it is what I am not u[s]ed to.

[s]aid he--- Why the Briti[s]h Queen, to be [s]ure, [s]aid I.--- But then you make no di[s]tinction, [s]aid he, between the con[s]cious dignity of a queen, and the pert [s]upercilious airs of a favourite actre[s]s: if the world were guided by the bright example [s]et from the British throne, pride would be entirely aboli[s]hed. That would be a heavenly thing, [s]aid I; for the annihilation of pride is like the di[s][s]olution of the body, it un[s]etters the [s]oul, and leaves it free and unconsined to [s]oar above the [s]tars. I have frequently been engaged in di[s]putes concerning women of this profe[s][s]ion---it puts me beyond all patience to hear people advance an opinion [s]o very contracted and illiberal, as that of [s]uppo[s]ing no woman can be virtuous who is on the [s]tage---I know many at this time who are ornaments not only to their profe[s][s]ion, but to the [s]ex in general: even the lady I have ju[s]t mentioned is generous, humane, and prudent, pride is her only [s]ault.---Charming woman! I have often [s]aid, when I was enchanted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] with her performance of [s]ome amiable character--- conquer but that one foible, and our admiration will ri[s]e into veneration.---I am confident a woman may, if [s]he is [s]o inclined, be as virtuous as Lucrece behind the [s]cenes of a theatre. Virtue begets re[s]pect wherever [s]he appears; on the contrary, a woman of loo[s]e inclination, though [s]he is immured in a convent, will find opportunities of doing evil.---It is a great pity [s]o many women belonging to the [s]tage are thus inclined; but why [s]hould we, on account of tho[s]e that are bad, condemn a Siddons, Brunton, Kemble, or Pope?---Why [s]hould a woman, if [s]he is a good wife, daughter, or mother, be le[s]s respected becau[s]e [s]he has genius to contribute to our amusement, by bringing before our eyes heroines we have [s]o often read of, and exhibiting characters we [s]o greatl admire?---for my part, I never judge of a per[s]on from their pro[s]e[s][s]ion or [s]ituation in life; it is from their actions I form an idea of their disposition; and as I think genius and merit de[s]erve as much e[s]teem when we meet them in an humble man[s]ion as when they inherit palaces, [s]o are virtue and prudence as valuable an acqui[s]ition in an actre[s]s, as in the daughter of a peer, and alike to be esteemed and re[s]pected. It is a[s]toni[s]hing to me how people can complain for want of amu[s]ement. I am never a moment without [s]omething to amu[s]e, in[s]truct, or interest me---I never walk abroad but I am attentive to every little incident that happens: a [s]olitary, [s]low place, the folded arms, or down-ca[s]t eye, will excite my compa[s][s]ion, and a joyous [s]erene a[s]pect will exhilirate my [s]pirits---even in a wilderne[s]s where never human [s]tep marked the green turf, or [s]wept the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] dew drops from the waving gra[s]s, even there I would find company, conver[s]ation, and amu[s]ement. To a thinking mind, the book of nature is ever open for our peru[s]al; and a [s]oul warmed by sensibility and gratitude, reads the divine pages with pleasure, and contemplates the great [s]ource of all with wonder, reverence, and love. As I wandered along, encouraging the[s]e plea[s]ing reflections, I [s]aw an old man buying [s]ome [s]tale bread and meat at the window of a mean eating-hou[s]e; he [s]tood with his back towards me; his coat was dirty and torn; his whole appearance was expre[s][s]ive of the mo[s]t abject poverty.---Friend, [s]aid I, going up to him; perhaps this trifle may procure you a better meal, putting half a guinea into his hand. It always gives my heart a pang when I [s]ee age and di[s]tre[s]s combined---age of it[s]elf always brings angui[s]h enough.---How very in[s]upportable, then, mu[s]t it be, when there are no comforts, no little indulgencies, to compen[s]ate for tho[s]e days of unavoidable pain. As I pre[s]ented my little donation, I looked in the old man's face---I thought I had [s]een the features, but could not recollect where. Humanity is not entirely bani[s]hed from the world, [s]aid he, turning part from me to conceal his emotion. I immediately knew his voice---it was the old lieutenant.---Good God! [s]aid I, [s]topping him as he was going from me, what has reduced you to this di[s]tre[s][s]ed [s]ituation? Misfortune, [s]aid he. And did not you know where I lived? I was a[s]hamed to beg, [s]aid he---a [s]udden glow pa[s][s]ing over his languid features---and I thought, Sir, you would be a[s]hamed to own an acquaintance with poverty. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] You [s]hall go home with me, [s]aid I, calling an hackney coach---let tho[s]e take [s]hame to them[s]elves who deny a part of their wealth to merit in di[s]tre[s]s. I am proud to acknowledge my[s]elf the friend of a man of worth, though he [s]hould be in the lowe[s]t situation. And why, [s]aid I, as we drove towards home, why [s]hould a man be a[s]hamed of his misfortunes? why [s]hould poverty call a blu[s]h upon the cheek of merit? we did not mark out our own fortunes. But then the world, the world, Sir, will always [s]coff and [s]purn the man humbled by the griping hand of penury: nor is there an object than in general meets with more contempt from the rich and powerful, than tho[s]e who have [s]een better days, but are reduced by unavoidable misfortunes to a dependence on their [s]miles. Strange in[s]atuation! to [s]et them[s]elves in the pride of their hearts, above their fellow creatures; and for what, truly? becau[s]e a little more yellow dirt has fallen to their [s]hare. I believe there are but few who know the true value of riches, and fewer [s]till reflect that they are only [s]tewards of the wealth which the bounty of their Creator has committed to their care; and at la[s]t, when we all come to give an account of our [s]teward[s]hip, the man who from a truly compa[s][s]ionate nature has wiped the tear from he eyes of orphans, [s]oftened the [s]etters of the captive, or cheared the widow, will receive a greater reward than the o[s]tentatious wretch, who, having [s]pent his whole life in ama[s][s]ing trea[s]ure, on his death bed, when he can no longer enjoy it, leaves it for the endowment of an ho[s]pital. Such a man is not charitable from his feelings for others, but an inordinate de[s]ire he has to have his own memory held in veneration. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] And do you think there are [s]uch characters in the world, [s]aid the old Lieutenant? I fear there are too many, friend, [s]aid I. I know not how it was, [s]aid he, but I never suspected mankind of half the vices and follies I have found in this [s]hort month that I have been in London; and even now I do not think their errors proceed half [s]o much from the badne[s]s of their hearts as their heads. I own, continued he, it is our duty to render every [s]ervice in our power to our fellow creatures, but why [s]hould one, becau[s]e he has a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of his duty, and di[s]charges it faithfully, de[s]pi[s]e an other becau[s]e he has not the [s]ame feelings. I felt a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of having, in commending benevolence, founded my own prai[s]e---it was my turn to be a[s]hamed.---I felt aba[s]hed, and [s]hrunk, as it were, into nothing.---Oh, man! what a poor weak creature thou art, when even in the moment of discharging thy duty, thy own heart, ea[s]ily led a[s]tray, will vaunt and boa[s]t its own [s]uperiority.---The mo[s]t benevolent action in the world loo[s]es its intrin[s]ic merit, when the man who performs it [s]ays to him[s]elf, I am better than my neighbour; I am not hard hearted, nor proud, nor avaricious. No, cries humility, but you are vain glorious. I was quite di[s]concerted, and could not forgive my[s]elf. I had ordered my [s]ervant to [s]upply Mr. Nel[s]on (for that was the name of the old Lieutenant) with every thing nece[s][s]ary for him to appear in at dinner, and then went to [s]eek my Emma.---I found her in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] the garden---the young lady I had re[s]cued la[s]t night was bu[s]y in platting a little lock of hair, and placing it in a fanciful manner, to the bottom of a picture which hung round her neck. When [s]he had finished, [s]he glanced her eye towards us, and thinking [s]he was not ob[s]erved, pre[s][s]ed it [s]everal times to her lips. I thought I [s]aw a tear in her eye, but the cha[s]te look, the religious fervour with which [s]he gazed upon the portrait, convinced me it was a tear who[s]e [s]ource might be acknowledged without a blu[s]h. She had dropped the picture, and, re[s]ting one arm upon a pede[s]tal, [s]eemed attentively watching Harriet and Lucy, who had dre[s][s]ed a little favourite dog in their dolls cloaths, and was teaching it to dance a minuet.---The [s]cene was picture[s]que; and I know not how long I might have contemplated it with silent [s]atisfaction, had I not ob[s]erved Mr. Nel[s]on coming toward me with eager [s]tep and anxious eye. Tell me, who is that? [s]aid he, pointing to the young lady---but that I think 'tis impo[s][s]ible, I [s]hould [s]ay 'tis my Narci[s][s]a. At the [s]ound of his voice the young lady looked up, and, advancing a few [s]teps, [s]tood in an attitude of wonder and a[s]toni[s]hment, till he pronounced the name of Narci[s][s]a; when [s]pringing like lightning to him, [s]he threw her arms round his neck, and cried, Yes, yes, I am your child. It would be doing inju[s]tice to the re[s]t of the [s]cene, were I to attempt to de[s]cribe it---words could not [s]peak the feelings of their hearts---It was a meeting between a fond father and an affectionate child---and I leave it to [s]uch to judge of their happine[s]s. When we had dined, and the cloth was removed--- Tell me, my dear Sir, [s]aid Narci[s][s]a, by what [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] lucky accident you came acquainted with this gentleman, and what brought you at this time to London? How can you a[s]k me that, my child? replied the old man; did you think your mother and my[s]elf could [s]it quietly down when you had been ab[s]ent from us near a month, and we had never had a single line from you? I wrote twice a week, [s]aid Narci[s][s]a, wiping her eyes---[s]he could not bear to hear her mother had been di[s]tre[s][s]ed. The old man continued--- I was too much intere[s]ted in the [s]afety of my dear girl to be at ea[s]e under [s]uch di[s]agreeable appearances; [s]o leaving your mother what money I could [s]pare, I [s]at out to walk to London, but was prevented by this gentleman.---On my arrival in town I went to the place where the old lady re[s]ided, and was told by her [s]ervant that you were gone out of town to pa[s]s a few weeks---I walked to the place whither I was directed, but could find no [s]uch per[s]on---My little [s]tock was almo[s]t exhau[s]ted---I went again to the lady's hou[s]e, and was treated by her [s]ervant with insolence. Narci[s][s]a laid her hand on his [s]houlder and gave him a look that I am [s]ure would have healed every wound the [s]ervant's in[s]olence had given his heart, though they had been a thou[s]and. Oh! filial love, fair daughter of gratitude, [s]i[s]ter to piety, thou fir[s]t favourite of Heaven, to whom long life and pro[s]perous days are promi[s]ed, how doth thy angel's face and [s]oothing hand make the paternal evening of life clear and unclouded!---But I am wandering from my [s]tory. I was now, continued Mr. Nel[s]on, reduced to my la[s]t [s]hilling, and being a week in arrears for my lodging, was forced to [s]ell my coat, and be content [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] with an old ragged [s]urtout---I wrote to the lady two days [s]ince, but received no an[s]wer, and was almo[s]t driven to de[s]pair---when chance again threw me in the way of this gentleman---But how am I to account for your being here, my child?---what was the cau[s]e of your neglect and [s]ilence?---I think, Narci[s][s]a if you had known my anxiety, you would have relieved it by either coming or writing to me. The per[s]on to who[s]e care you entru[s]ted me, [s]aid Narci[s][s]a was a vile woman; and it is only by a miracle I can have e[s]caped her [s]nare---I never knew you was in town---I have been whirled about from one folly to another, and have been witne[s]s to [s]uch [s]cenes of [s]hame as made me [s]hudder; but I was told it was u[s]ual for people of quality to lead a life of riot, which my vile preceptre[s]s termed plea[s]ure.--- A young nobleman paid me particular attention, talked much of love, and [s]ettlements, and grandeur, but never mentioned marriage---I was ever on my guard; nor, indeed, was my heart prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed in his favour---His per[s]on was not unplea[s]ing, but his manner was di[s]gu[s]ting, his morals corrupt, and his conver[s]ation uncha[s]te---I had frequently intreated leave to return to the country; frequently wrote to you, my dear father, de[s]iring to be commanded home--- But la[s]t night, la[s]t night--- She then proceeded to give him an account of what has been already related to the reader---When [s]he mentioned the villain's attempt upon her honor, her father looked down to the [s]ide where his [s]word u[s]ed to hang---then at his hand---then at his child--- then at his hand again--- It is not [s]o withered, [s]aid he, but it might [s]end a [s]word to his heart---It is not [s]o much unnerved, [s]aid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] he, ri[s]ing, and placing him[s]elf in an attitude of defence, but it might make a villain tremble. He is beneath your anger [s]aid Narci[s][s]a, taking his hand and ki[s][s]ing it---this hand, [s]aid [s]he, that [s]o often has [s]ought for the honor of your country [s]hall never be [s]ullied with the blood of a coward; for who but a coward would ruin a poor, defencele[s]s woman. Who but a coward indeed, cried I, for who can look at a woman in all her native loveline[s]s, helpless, unarmed, devoid of the lea[s]t defence again[s]t the numerous dangers that await her; who that [s]ees her [s]weet looks, that [s]eem to [s]peak in nature's pure language--- behold I am at your mercy, you are my protector, I am weak and defencele[s]s, it is you mu[s]t guard me---who but a barbarian, after having [s]een woman in this light, would attempt to injure or insult her. Yet do I blu[s]h while I confe[s]s it, in[s]tead of remembering our duty towards the lovely [s]ex, man, who was de[s]igned by Heaven as their friend, is become their [s]educer; and the fairer the flower, the more eager are they to bla[s]t it---like the [s]caly [s]nake who tries to draw to its devouring jaws the harmle[s]s bird that thoughtle[s]s hops from [s]pray to [s]pray; he twines about, thews all his glided [s]cales, ba[s]ks in the [s]un, rears up his cre[s]ted head, and courts the little [s]ong[s]ter to his [s]nare---It ventures fir[s]t to gaze at a di[s]tance on him, then, by degrees draws nearer to admire, till, facinated by his [s]ubtile arts, it drops into his jaws and meets de[s]truction. Oh! how my heart has often bled to [s]ee [s]o many lovely women, who were intended by nature to be the plea[s]ing bond of [s]ociety, the [s]ource of virtuous plea[s]ures, reduced to the [s]ad alternative of peri[s]hing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf324v1&image=324-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] for want, or living on the wages of pro[s]titution.--- But oh! woman, when thou can[s]t [s]o far forget what is due to thy own [s]ex as to be acce[s][s]ary to the ruin of the innocent, my heart [s]wells with indignation--- thou art then like the fallen angel, who, when in heaven, was the fir[s]t among the bright ethereal bodies, but falling, becomes the lowe[s]t; and envious of tho[s]e joys which he can never ta[s]te, exerts his arts, his malice, and deceit, to draw down others to the [s]ame dark aby[s]s which he him[s]elf is plunged in. He had frequently begg'd of me---and when I relieved him, returned a look of gratitude---I always feel my[s]elf intere[s]ted for tho[s]e poor creatures who are brought from their native country, and expo[s]ed to all the horrors of famine in a place with who[s]e customs and language they are entirely unacquainted--- I [s]ay within my[s]elf, what a poor mi[s]erable wretch [s]hould I be if I were left in their country without money or friends---We can never feel properly the woes of another, unle[s]s we place our[s]elves for a few moments in their [s]ituation. This man was generally near my habitation, and I often felt [s]omething like curio[s]ity to know his history--- He appeared to me [s]uperior to the common rank of beggars---I will a[s]k him, [s]aid I, one day; perhaps it may lie in my power to make his life a little more tolerable---I [s]ent for him to my [s]tudy, and having proffered my [s]ervice, inquired into his former fortunes---Chri[s]tian, [s]aid he, I am a man who hold your race in utter abhorrence---I have been injured, vilely injured, by them, in return for kindne[s]s and [
