 and will mak zow within short space weary of the haill airt: quhair as, gif Nature be cheif, and bent to it, reulis will be ane help and staff to Nature. I will end heir, lest my preface be langer nor my purpose and haill mater following: wishing zow, docile Reidar, als gude succes and great proffeit by reiding this short treatise, as I tuke earnist and willing panis to blok it, as ze sie, for zour cause. Fare weill. quhilks are not cuttit or brokin, bot alyke many feit in euerie lyne of the verse, and how they are commounly namit, with my opinioun for quhat subiectis ilk kynde of thir verse is meitest to be vsit. haue put in the reule, quhilk teachis zow to knaw quhat is Flovving , I haue markit the lang fute with this mark,  ¯ and abone the heid of the shorte fute, I haue put this mark  u Sen for zour saik I vvryte vpon zour airt, Apollo, Pan, and ze o Musis nyne, And thou, o Mercure, for to help thy pairt I do implore, sen thou be thy ingyne, Nixt efter Pan had found the quhissill, syne Thou did perfyte, that quhilk he bot espyit: And efter that made Argus for to tyne (quha kepit Io) all his vvindois by it. Concurre ze Gods, it can not be denyit: Sen in your airt of Po esie I vvryte. Auld birds to learne by teiching it is tryit: Sic docens discam gif ze help to dyte. Then Reidar sie of nature thou haue pairt, Syne laikis thou nocht, bot heir to reid the airt. Ane rype ingyne, ane quick and vvalkned vvitt, VVith sommair reasons, suddenlie applyit, For euery purpose vsing reasons fitt, VVith skilfulnes, vvhere learning may be spyit, With pithie vvordis, for to expres zovv by it His full intention in his proper leid, The puritie quhairof, vveill hes he tryit: With memorie to keip quhat he dois reid, With skilfulnes and figuris, quhilks proceid From Rhetorique, vvith euerlasting fame, With vthers vvoundring preassing vvith all speid For to atteine to merite sic a name. All thir into the perfyte Po ete be. Goddis, grant I may obteine the Laurell trie. That ze ryme nocht twyse in ane syllabe. As for exemple, that ze make not proue and reproue ryme together, nor houe for houeing on hors bak, and behoue. That ze ryme ay to the hinmest lang syllabe, (with accent) in the lyne, suppose it be not the hinmest syllabe in the lyne, as bakbyte zovv ,  & out flyte zovv , It rymes in byte & flyte , because of the lenth of the syllabe,  & accent being there, and not in zovv , howbeit it be the hinmest syllabe of ather of the lynis. Or question and digestion , It rymes in ques & ges , albeit they be bot the antepenult syllabis, and vther twa behind ilkane of thame. Ze aucht alwayis to note, That as in thir foirsaidis, or the lyke wordis, it rymes in the hinmest lang syllabe in the lyne, althoucht there be vther short syllabis behind it, Sa is the hinmest lang syllabe the hinmest fute, suppose there be vther short syllabis behind it, quhilkis are eatin vp in the pronounceing, and na way is comptit as fete. Ze man be war likewayis (except necessitie compell yow) with R yming in Termis , quhilk is to say, that your first or hinmest word in the lyne, exceid not twa or thre syllabis at the maist, vsing thrie als seindill as ye can. The cause quhairfore ze sall not place a lang word first in the lyne, is, that all lang words hes ane syllabe in them sa verie lang, as the lenth thair of eatis vp in the pronouncing euin the vther syllabes, quhilks ar placit lang in the same word, and thairfore spillis the flowing of that lyne. As for exeple, in this word, Arabia , the second syllabe ( ra ) is sa lang, that it eatis vp in the prononcing [ a ] quhilk is the hinmest syllabe of the same word. Quhilk [a] althoct it be in a lang place, zit it kythis not sa, because of the great lenth of the preceding syllabe ( ra ). As to the cause quhy ze sall not put a lang word hinmest in the lyne, It is, because, that the lenth of the secound syllabe ( ra ) eating vp the lenth of the vther lang syllabe, [ a ] makis it to serue bot as a tayle vnto it, together with the short syllabe preceding. And because this tayle nather seruis for cullour nor fute, as I spak before, it man be thairfore repetit in the nixt lyne ryming vnto it, as it is set doune in the first: quhilk makis, that ze will scarcely get many wordis to ryme vnto it, zea, nane at all will ze finde to ryme to sindrie vther langer wordis. Thairfore cheifly be warre of inserting sic lang wordis hinmest in the lyne, for the cause quhilk I last allegit. Besydis that nather first nor last in the lyne, it keipis na Flovving . The reulis  & cautelis quhairof are thir, as followis. That is, some schort, some lang, and some indifferent. Be indifferent I meane, thay quhilk are ather lang or short, according as ze place thame. The forme of placeing syllabes in verse, is this. That zour first syllabe in the lyne be short, the second lang, the thrid short, the fourt lang, the fyft short, the sixt lang, and sa forth to the end of the lyne. Alwayis tak heid, that the nomber of zour fete in euery lyne be euin, & nocht odde: as four, six, aucht, or ten: & not thrie, fyue, seuin, or nyne, except it be in broken verse quhilkis are out of reul and daylie inuentit be dyuers Poetis Bot gif ze wald ask me the reulis, quhairby to knaw euerie ane of thir thre foirsaidis kyndis of syllabes, I answer, Zour eare man be the onely iudge and discerner thairof. And to proue this, I remit to the iudgement of the same, quhilk of thir twa lynis following flowis best, u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯ Into the Sea then Lucifer vpsprang. u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯ In the Sea then Lucifer to vpsprang. I doubt not bot zour eare makkis zou easilie to persaue, that the first lyne flowis weil,  &the vther nathing at all. The reasoun is, because the first lyne keips the reule abone written, To wit, the first fute short, the secound lang, and sa furth, as I shewe before: quhair as the vther is direct contrair to the same. Bot specially tak heid, quhen zour lyne is of fourtene, that zour Sectioun in aucht be a lang monosyllabe, or ellis the hinmest syllabe of a word alwais being lang, as I said before. The cause quhy it ma be ane of thir twa, is, for the Musique, because that quhen zour lyne is ather of xiiij or xii fete, it wilbe drawin sa lang in the singing, as ze man rest in the middes of it, quhilk is the Sectioun : sa as, gif zour Sectioun be nocht ather a monosyllabe, or ellis the hinmest syllabe of a word as I said before, bot the first syllabe of a polysyllabe, the Musique sall make zow sa to rest in the middes of that word, as it sall cut the ane half of the word fra the vther, and sa sall mak it seme twa different wordis, that is bot ane. This aucht onely to be obseruit in thir foirsaid lang lynis: for the shortnes of all shorter lynis, then thir before mentionat, is the cause, that the Musique makis na rest in the middes of thame, and thairfore thir obseruationis seruis nocht for thame. Onely tak heid, that the Sectioun in thame kythe something langer nor any vther feit in that lyne, except the secound and the last, as I haue said before. Ze man tak heid lykewayis, that zour langest lynis exceid nocht fourtene fete, and that zour shortest be nocht within foure. Remember also to mak a Sectioun in the middes of euery lyne, quhether the lyne be lang or short. Be Sectioun I mean, that gif zour lyne be of fourtene fete, zour aucht fute, man not only be langer then the seuint, or vther short fete, bot also langer nor any vther lang fete in the same lyne, except the secound and the hinmest. Or gif your lyne be oft welf fete, zour Sectioun to be in the sext Or gif of ten, zour Sectioun to be in the sext also. The cause quhy it is not in fyue, is, because fyue is odde, and euerie odde fute is short. Or gif your lyne be of aucht fete, zour Sectioun to be in the fourt. Gif of sex, in the fourt also. Gif of four, zour Sectioun to be in twa. Ze aucht likewise be war with oft composing zour haill lynis of monosyllabis onely, (albeit our language haue sa many, as we can nocht weill eschewe it) because the maist pairt of thame are indifferent, and may be in short or lang place, as ze like. Some wordis of dyuers syllabis are likewayis indifferent, as Thairfore, restore. I thairfore, then. In the first, thairfore , ( thair ) is short, and ( fore ) is lang: In the vther, ( thair ) is lang,  &( fore ) is short, and zit baith flowis alike weill. Bot thir indifferent wordis, composit ofdyuers syllabes, are rare, suppose in monosyllabes, comoun. The cause then, quhy ane haill lyne aucht nocht to be composit of monosyllabes only, is, that they being for the maist pairt indifferent, nather the secound, hinmest, nor Sectioun , will be langer nor the other lang fete in the same lyne. Thairfore ze man place a word coposit of dyuers syllabes, and not indifferent, ather in the secound, hinmest, or Sectioun , or in all thrie. Ze man also tak heid, that quhen thare fallis any short syllabis efter the last lang syllabe in the lyne, that ze repeit thame in the lyne quhilk rymis to the vther, evin as ze set them downe in the first lyne: as for exempill, ze man not say Then feir nocht Nor heir ocht. Bot Then feir nocht Nor heir nocht. Repeting the same, nocht , in baith the lynis: because this syllabe, nocht , nather seruing for cullour nor fute, is bot a tayle to the lang fute preceding, and thairfore is repetit lykewayis in the nixt lyne, quhilk rymes vnto it, euin as it set doun in the first. There is also a kynde of indifferent wordis, asweill as of syllabis, albeit few in nomber. The nature quhairof is, that gif ze place thame in the begynning of a lyne, they are shorter be a fute, nor they are, gif ze place thame hinmest in the lyne as Sen patience I man haue perforce I liue in hope vvith patience. Ze se there are bot aucht fete in ather of baith thir lynis aboue written. The cause quhairof is, that patience , in the first lyne, in respect it is in the beginning thairof, is bot of twa fete, and in the last lyne, of thrie, in respect it is the hinmest word of that lyne. To knaw  & discerne thir kynde of wordis fro vtheris, zour eare man be the onely iudge, as of all the vther parts of Flovving , the verie twiche stane quhairof is Musique. I haue teachit zow now shortly the reulis of Ryming, Fete , and Flovving . There restis yet to teache zow the wordis, sentences, and phrasis necessair for a Poete to vse in his verse, quhilk I haue set doun in reulis, as efter followis. First, that in quhatsumeuer ze put in verse, ze put in na wordis, ather metri causa , or zit, for filling furth the nomber of the fete, bot that they be all sa necessare as ze should be constrainit to vse thame, in cace ze were speiking the same purpose in prose. And thairfore that zour wordis appeare to haue cum out willingly, and by nature, and not to haue been thrawin out constrainedly, be compulsioun That ze eschew to insert in zour verse, a lang rable of mennis names, or names of tounis, or sik vther names. Because it is hard to mak many lang names all placit together, to flow weill. Thairfore quhen that fallis out in zour purpose, ze sall ather put bot twa or thre of thame in euerie lyne, mixing vther wordis amang thame, or ellis specifie bot twa or thre of thame at all, saying ( VVith the laif of that race ) or ( VVith the rest in thay pairtis ) or sic vther lyke wordis: as for exemple, Out through his cairt, quhair Eous vvas eik VVith other thre, quhilk Phaeton had dravvin. Ze sie thair is bot ane name there specifeit, to serue for vther thrie of that sorte. Ze man also take heid to frame zour wordis and sentencis according to the mater: As in Flyting and Inuectiues, zour wordis to be cuttit short, and hurland ouer heuch. For thais quhilkis are cuttit short, I meane be sic wordis as thir, Iis neir cair for I sall neuer cair , gif zour subiect were of loue, or tragedies. Because in thame zour words man be drawin lang, quhilkis in Flyting man be short. Ze man lykewayis tak heid, that ze waill zour wordis according to the purpose: As, in ane heich and learnit purpose, to vse heich, pithie, and learnit wordis. Gif zour purpose be of loue, To vse commoun language, with some passionate wordis. Gif zour purpose be of tragicall materis, To vse lamentable wordis, with some heich, as rauishit in admiratioun. Gif zour purpose be of landwart effairis, To vse corruptit and vplandis wordis. And finally, quhatsumeuer be zour subiect, to vse vocabula artis , quhairby ze may the mair viuelie represent that persoun, quhais pairt ze paint out. This is likewayis neidfull to be vsit in sentences, als weill as in wordis. As gif zour subiect be heich and learnit, to vse learnit and infallible reasonis, prouin be necessities. Gif zour subiect be of loue, To vse wilfull reasonis, proceding rather from passioun, nor reasoun Gif zour subiect be of landwart effaris, To vse sklender reasonis, mixt with grosse ignorance, nather keiping forme nor ordour. And sa furth, euer framing zour reasonis, according to the qualitie of zour subiect. Let all zour verse be Literall , sa far as may be, quhatsumeuer kynde they be of, bot speciallie Tumbling verse for flyting. Be Literall I meane, that the maist pairt of zour lyne, sall rynne vpon a letter, as this tumbling lyne rynnis vpon F. Fetching fude for to feid it fast furth of the Farie. Ze man obserue that thir Tumbling verse flowis not on that fassoun, as vtheris dois For all vtheris keipis the reule quhilk I gaue before, To wit, the first fute short the secound lang, and sa furth. Quhair as thir hes twa short, and ane lang throuch all the lyne, quhen they keip ordour: albeit the maist pairt of thame be out of ordour,  & keipis na kynde nor reule of Flovving ,  & for that cause are callit Tumbling verse: except the short lynis of aucht in the hinder end of the verse, the quhilk flow is as vther verses dois, as ze will find in the hinder end of this buke, quhair I giue exemple of sindrie kyndis of versis. Epithetis , and Prouerbis. As for Comparisons , take heid that they be sa proper for the subiect, that nather they be ouer bas, gif zour subiect be heich, for then sould zour subiect disgrace zour Comparisoun , nather zour Comparisoun be heich quhen zour subiect is basse, for then sall zour Comparisoun disgrace zour subiect. Bot let sic a mutuall correspondence and similitude be betwix the, as it may appeare to be a meit Comparisoun for sic a subiect, and sa sall they ilkane decore vther. As for Epithetis , It is to descryue brieflie, en passant , the naturall of euerie thing ze speik of, be adding the proper adiectiue vnto it, quhairof there are twa fassons. The ane is, to descryue it, be making a corruptit worde, composit of twa dyuers simple wordis, as Apollo gyde-Sunne The vther fasson, is, be Circumlocution , as Apollo reular of the Sunne, I esteme this last fassoun best, Because it expressis the authouris meaning als weill as the vther, and zit makis na corruptit wordis, as the vther dois. As for the Prouerbis , they man be proper for the subiect, to beautifie it, chosen in the same forme as the Comparisoun. the figure of Repetitioun, as Quhylis ioy rang, Quhylis noy rang. &c. Ze sie this word quhylis is repetit heir. This forme of repetitioun sometyme vsit, decoris the verse very mekle, zea quhen it cumis to purpose, it will be cumly to repete sic a word aucht or nyne tymes in a verse. bene ower oft vsit of before. As in speciall, gif ze speik of loue, be warre ze descryue zour Loues makdome, or her fairnes. And siclyke that ze descryue not the morning, and rysing of the Sunne, in the Preface of zour verse: for thir thingis are sa oft and dyuerslie writtin vpon be Poetis already, that gif ze do the lyke, it will appeare, ze bot imitate, and that it cummis not of zour awin Inuentioun , quhilk is ane of the cheif properteis of ane Poete. Thairfore gif zour subiect be to prayse zour Loue , ze sall rather prayse hir vther qualiteis, nor her fairnes, or hir shaip: or ellis ze sall speik some lytill thing of it, and syne say, that zour wittis are sa smal, and zour vtterace sa barren, that ze can not discryue any part of hir worthelie: remitting alwayis to the Reider, to iudge of hir, in respect sho matches, or rather excellis Venus , or any woman, quhome to it sall please zow to compaire her. Bot gif zour subiect be sic, as ze man speik some thing of the morning, or Sunne rysing, tak heid, that quhat name ze giue to the Sunne, the Mone, or vther starris, the ane tyme, gif ze happin to wryte thairof another tyme, to change thair names. As gif ze call the Sunne Titan , at a tyme, to call him Phoebus or Apollo the vther tyme, and siclyke the Mone, and vther Planettis. that ze inuent zour awin subiect, zour self, and not to compose of sene subiectis. Especially, translating any thing out of vther language, quhilk doing, ze not onely essay not zour awin ingyne of Inuentioun , bot be the same meanes, ze are bound, as to a staik, to follow that buikis phrasis, quhilk ze translate. Ze man also be war of wryting any thing of materis of comoun weill, or vther sic graue sene subiectis (except Metaphorically, of manifest treuth opinly knawin, zit nochtwithstanding vsing it very seindil) because nocht onely ze essay nocht zour awin Inuentioun , as I spak before, bot lykewayis they are to graue materis, for a Poet to mell in. Bot because ze can not haue the I nuentioun except it come of Nature, I remit it thairvnto, as the cheif cause, not onely of Inuentioun , bot also of all the vther pairtis of Poesie. For airt is onely bot ane help and a remembraunce to Nature, as I shewe zow in the Preface. tuiching the kyndis of versis, mentionat in the Preface. First, there is ryme quhilk seruis onely for lang historeis, and zit are nocht verse. As for exemple, In Maii vvhen that the blissefull Phoebus bricht, The lamp of ioy, the heauens gemme of licht, The goldin cairt, and the etheriall King, With purpour face in Orient dois spring, Maist angel-lyke ascending in his sphere, And birds vvith all thair heauenlie voces cleare Dois mak a svveit and heauinly harmony, And fragrant flours aois spring vp lustely: Into this season svveitest of delyte, To vvalk I had a lusty appetyte. And sa furth. For the descriptioun of Heroique actis, Martiall and knichtly faittis of armes, vse this kynde of verse following, call it Heroicall , As Meik mundane mirrour, myrrie and modest, Blyth, kynde, and courtes, comelie, clene, and chest, To all exemple for thy honestie, As richest rose, or rubie, by the rest, VVith gracis graue, and gesture maist digest, Ay to thy honnour alvvayis hauing eye. Were fassons fliemde, they micht be found in the: Of blissings all, be blyth, thovv hes the best, With euerie berne belouit for to be. For any heich &graue subiectis, specially drawin out or learnit authouris, vse this kynde of verse following, callit Ballat Royal , as That nicht he ceist, and vvent to bed, bot greind Zit fast for day, and thocht the nicht to lang: At last Diana doun her head recleind, Into the sea. Then Lucifer vpsprang, Auroras post, vvhome sho did send amang The Ieittie cludds, for to foretell ane hour, Before sho stay her tears, quhilk Ouide sang Fell for her loue, quhilk turnit in a flour. For tragicall mater is, complaintis, or testamentis, vse this kynde of verse following, callit Troilus verse, as To thee Echo, and thovv to me agane, In the desert, amangs the vvods and vvells, Quhair destinie hes bound the to remane, But company, vvithin the firths and fells, Let vs complein, vvith vvoful zoutts and zells, A shaft, a shotter, that our harts hes slane: To thee Echo, and thovv to me agane. For flyting, or Inuectiues, vse this kynde of verse following, callit Rouncefalis or Tumbling verse. In the hinder end of haruest vpon Alhallovv ene, Quhen our gude nichtbors rydis (nou gif I reid richt) Some bucklit on a benvvod, & some on a bene, Ay trottand into troupes fra the tvvylicht: Some sadland a sho ape, all grathed into grene: Some hotcheand on a hemp stalk, hovand on a heicht. The king of Fary vvith the Court of the Elf quene, VVith many elrage Incubus rydand that nicht: There ane elf on ane ape ane vnsell begat: Besyde a pot baith auld and vvorne, This bratshard in ane bus vvas borne: They fand a monster on the morne, VVar facit nor a Cat. For compendious praysing of any bukes, or the authouris thairof, or ony argumentis of vther historeis, quhair sindrie sentences, and change of purposis are requyrit, vse Sonet verse, of fourtene lynis, and ten fete in euery lyne. The exemple quhairof, I neid nocht to shaw zow, in respect I haue set doun twa in the beginning of this treatise. In materis of loue, vse this kynde of verse, quhilk we call Commoun verse, as Quhais ansvver made thame nocht sa glaid That they sould thus the victors be, As euen the ansvver quhilk I haid Did greatly ioy and confort me: Quhen lo, this spak Apollo myne, All that thou seikis, it sall be thyne. Lyke verse of ten fete, as this foirsaid is of aucht, ze may vse lykewayis in loue materis: as also all kyndis of cuttit and brokin verse, quhairof new formes are daylie inuentit according to the Poetis pleasour, as Quha vvald haue tyrde to heir that tone, Quhilk birds corroborat ay abone Throuch schouting of the Larkis? They sprang sa heich into the skyes Quhill Cupide vvalknis vvith the cryis Of Naturis chapell Clarkis. Then leauing all the Heauins aboue He lichted on the eard.
