 Chester equiti aurato, salutem, & in agnita veritate constantem zelum, a Domino Iesv , vnico omnium piorum seruatore, Thomas Blage Cantabrigiensis optat, atque ex animo precatur.

As I did musing lie, with sundrie thoughtes opprest, Seeking to salue my carefull minde, of paine to be redrest: And pondring how my youth full ydlely I had spent, In scilence only wrapped vp, my minde it did torment. From darknesse vnto light I thought it best to call, By setting forth some little booke, which profite might vs all. And that I did intende is brought now to effect. At ydle houres I did it penne as time would me direct. The worke you plainely see, frende Printer what it is, Declare if printing it deserue, and what there is amis. Your meaning I perceiue, your purpose I allowe, In that you are so diligent to prosecute your vowe. And as in ages all, those haue their prayses due, Which painfully do runne their race, and idlenesse eschue: So can I not mislyke your noble enterprise: Which seeke to helpe your countreymen, with this your fyne deuise. But shall I tell you playne, herein what is my mynde? Me thinke this worke was done before, and it in print I fynde: For Esope as you knowe, already englisht is: And what doth yours, but taste of him? naught do I see but his. This briefly vnderstande, that Esope is not last In this my booke, nor only he alone doth stande agast: But sundry writers else aboute him here do stande, Both wittie, learned, eloquent, as hath ben tane in hande. Besides, if well you marke, comparyng that with myne, It is as neare as East to Weast, and drosse to Syluer fine. Uncomely tales in that are founde, and most absurde to reade, Of reason voyde, of mirth bereft, to no good ende they leade, No head nor foote in them is had, but set confusedly, On Esope falsly forged tales, what man can it denye? As in the lyfe of Xanthus wyfe, and others he doth write So rudely, falsly, foolishly, how then should this delite? Of Esope that I write, the Greeke text doth allowe, Dissenting cleane from that you thinke, let this content you nowe. In common place it is reduced, applying as I myght, So truely, vnto euery thing his proper place and right. From ninteene authors else, I haue selected out, Their fine deuise, their sayings wise, their pleasant deedes and stout. The truth hereof you heare, first trie, then iudgement giue: If contrary you finde to this then do not me beleue. I haue compared since your doings vnto his, And contrarie to that I thought, I fynde that nowe it is: Besides vncomely tales, and falsly forged Fables, Wherwith his booke replenisht is, perceyue I many bables. For yours and his do farre in euery case dissent, I see from whom you doe deriue, your doings and intente. To answer your demaund full readie am I prest, And will hereafter when you list, accomplishe your request.  FINIS. profit of Man haue put in remembrance their imaginations, they that haue writ Fables are to be accounted with the reste: for they haue not onely wonderfully delighted the harts of men, but also haue more allured them to doe thinges both good and profitable with their Fables, than Philosophers with their preceptes. For they with such a sweetnesse do so pierce the hartes of the Readers, and by similitudes do declare (whiche are of much force to moue affection) what men ought to take, and what to refuse, that thereby they are compelled, against their wils to agree vnto them. For the minde is disdaynfull to heare, neyther will it easely abyde things profitable and honest, excepte they bee poudered with some merry ieste Hereunto beareth witnesse a certein Orator of Athens , who on a tyme speaking to the Athenians , when he perceyued them lesse attentiue, required them that they would vouchsafe to heare a Fable: they were contented: then he began thus: Ceres, the Swallowe and the Egle sometime iorneyed togither, when they were come to a riuer, the Swallowe flue ouer, and the Eele swam through the riuer: when he hadde so sayd he held his peace, then they asked him what Ceres didde? Your Gods (quod he) are offended at you whiche will not heare them that counsell you for your profit, but if they tell any tales ye heare them willingly. What force fables are of to moue affection, I could declare by many examples, yet will I propound but three. The inhabitants of Samos would haue put their ruler to death, whome Æ sope dissuaded saying: As a Foxe passed ouer a riuer, he was driuen into a ditch wher he stucke so fast in the mudde, that he could not escape, who the flies stinged: the Hedgehog seing him there, moued with compassion, asked him if he shoulde driue the flies from him. No (quod he) for these are full with my bloud and can litle trouble me, but if thou shouldest dryue them away, other hunger sterued flies wil occupie their romes, and suck out all the bloud that is left within me. The like shall happen to you O Samians , for if ye slaye your Ruler whiche is so wealthie, ye must needes chose others, which whiles they enriche them selues, shall poll you of all that this man hath left: wherwith all the Samians being moued, left off their purpose. By the like meanes was Tiberius C aesar persuaded, when he appointed for euery day Magistrates, wherevpon (as Iosephus telleth) the Countrey of Iurie was gouerned by Cratus and Pilatus onely by the space of twentie yeares. For (as Statius saith) he that ruleth but a litle while, sheweth smal fauour to the people. The Himerians somtime minded to chose Captaine of their armie Phalaris the tyrant of Agrigentum , whome Stesichorus the Poet with this Fable discouraged from their purpose, saying: A horse fed alone in a medow, at length came a Harte thither and spoyled it: wherevpon the Horse tooke the aduise of man, by what meane he might be reuenged, to whome the man sayde: If thou wilt take a bytte in thy mouth and suffer me armed to gette vpon thy backe, whose counsell he followed, and by his helpe put the Harte to flight and became the conquerer, but from that tyme forth he could not rid his mouth from the byt nor the man from his backe. Euen so (sayde Stesichorus ) the like shall happen to you, if ye chose Phalaris your captayne, for your enimies ye shall subdue, but ye shall be in bondage to this Tyraunt for euer: with which wordes the Himerians being discouraged, forsoke the counsell to chose suche a Captayne, what time the people of Rome separated themselues from the Senators, bicause they payd tribute and were combred with warfares, did not Agrippa Menenius turne them from their purpose with this fable? Sometime (quoth he) ye Romaines , the members of man perceyuing the belly to be slouthfull, fell at variance with her and determined to giue her no longer any succor. It happened, that, bicause they denied her nourishment, they became faynt, whervpon they were at one againe. In like maner the Senate and people of Rome are as the belly and members, whiche neede one of anothers helpe, and as by discord they perishe, so by concord they are of strength: By whiche Tale the people turned from their purpose and became friends again with the Senate. Therfore not without good cause both the Greeke and Latin Poets, as Hesiodus and Horace , haue mingled such Fables amongst their workes, and also the chiefest and famous Philosophers, as Plato, Aristotle , and Plutarche , with many moe, haue highly comended them, whose opinion was, that they much auayled to the instruction of a moral and ciuill lyfe: wherefore Leouicenus and Ualla , of late writers the best lerned, did traslate Fables out of Greke into Latin, which they knew would be to their prayse, and to the delight and profite of others: Neyther were they deceyued, for they are dayly redde of most learned men. I can not therefore perceyue, why by translating these Fables, I should be defrauded of the prayse due to me, whiche other haue had, excepte we be so spitefull, that to vs that is not lawful, which with great commendation to the Grecians and Latinistes is allowed. Fare well. The Wolfe, the Foxe, and the Asse sometyme iournied togyther towardes Rome , to obtayne remission of theyr sinnes: In the way (bycause they thought the Pope woulde be otherwyse occupied, that he might not intende them) they agreed to be shriuen one of an other, and to suffer Penance at their discretion. The Wolfe therfore made hys confession to the Foxe in this manner: That he sawe a sowe which had .xij. pigs, the which walked alone in the fields, wallowing in fatnesse, and suffered hir pigs at home to starue: wherfore he deuoured the sowe, bycause of hir heynous offence in forsaking hir yong ones: and after, being moued to pitie, he killed also the pigs, to ridde them out of their payne, and eate them vp: This he tolde with teares, desiring to know what penance he shoulde doo therfore. In fayth (quod the Foxe) thy fault is not great, say once a Pater noster and then thou shalt be pardoned. Straight after, the Foxe began his confession thus: A countryman had a Cocke of the game, which bet and vanquished all other cocks neere about, who with his shril crowing, troubled in euery quarter, not onely the hole, but also the sicke persons, especially those which had the headake, whose pride I could not well away with: as I founde him therfore on a tyme abroade with the hens, I caught him, and caried him awaye to my hole, where I deuoured him: for which deed the Hens kackled against me,  & troubled me with their crying: I therefore to reuenge the iniurie done vnto me, tore manye of them in pieces and eate them: herein I confesse that I offended, therfore I require pardon. Herevnto the Wolfe sayd: Thou didst well in qualifying the noyse and pride of the Cocke and Hens, and therfore it is but a small fault, yet will I ioyne thee thys penance, That the three frydayes following, thou eate no fleshe, if thou canst get none: for I wil shewe thee as much fauoure, as thou didst to mee. Well nowe Sir sayde they to the Asse, let vs heare thy confession, who began thus: My moyling & drudgery which I endure, is not vnknowen to you my Lords, as in carying of corne sacks, stone, woode and water, yet once I offended, whereof I repented me ful oft: For a seruaunt of my Lordes, apointed ruler ouer me, being once a cold, a strawe appeared oute of hys shoo, whiche I snatched away from hym, whereby he tooke greate harme and colde of his feete. Therfore be mercifull vnto me, and ioyne me some penance. But they sayd, what haste thou done thou thefe? Mary fye on thee, by thy meanes that seruant had such hurte of his feete, that we thinke he is dead thereof, whereby thy soule is damned, and therefore thy bodye ought not to escape scotte free, then they killed and deuoured him. The mighty and riche men in lyke maner do pardon one another, but to the poore they are harde harted and inexorable. A Spider nigh weeried with continuall laboure, ceassed of hys woorke  & walked abroade for disport: whom the Goute met, and accompanied as fast as he could, though it were with muche payne: when that dayes iourney was nigh at a pointe, they approched neere to a little town called Tiche , where they determined to seeke fit lodging for their purpose. The Spider tooke litle heede but turned into the house of an exceeding riche man, where on euery side he set vp his streamers. The were straight at hande, those lyke Diuels in a playe, which cast downe his webs, and as fast as he set them vp in any parte of the house, they were swept downe: he coulde not worke so closely, but it was founde out such was his miserie, that in a house of so much wealth and abundance, he only wanted and was thrust downe. But the Goute went like a begger, (whiche caused him to be the longer without lodging) at length he gotte him to the cottage of a poore man, where when he had layde him downe to reste, it is not to be tolde what miserie he endured: his supper was coorse bread, and a Cup of cold water to drinke, when he was drye: hys bed to reste hys weerie bones vppon, was a harde boorde strewed without either boughs or grasse, but thinly with a litle strawe. I need not shewe, how ill agreed so harde a bed and so rude an hoste, to so tender limbes, and to his skin as soft as silke. When the day starre was scarse risen, the Goute and the Spider mette againe. Then the Spider first declared his nights yll reste, and how ofte he shifted his place: somtime vpbraiding the Maister with too much nicenesse, sometyme with the double diligece of the sweepers. Ah (quod the Goute) the pouertie of myne hoste is incredible: for if I had leisure, I could shew thee spots both black and blew, that my bed as harde as the Adamant, hath imprinted in my softe skin. Then they tooke counsaile thus once agayn, That the Spider should goo to the poore mans cottage, and the Goute to the riche mans house, wherevnto they bothe agreed. When it waxed darke, they came neere to a Citie, and the Goute remembring well hys appointment, faire and softly went into an exceeding riche mans house, where he hid him self: whom when the Maister had scarse seene, Iesu GOD, wt what harty good will, what kindnesse, and with what names dyd he entertayne him: straightway, he was layde vppon beds of Doune, hys bolsters stuffed with soft partriche feathers. I will not speake of the wynes, as sweete  & darke wynes, wynes of Lesbus and Campania , birdes that feede on grapes, phesants, and partie coloured birds: to conclude, there was no kinde of pleasure that his fantasie lacked. The Spider went into a poore mans cottage and began hys webs on euery side, from wall to wall he hanged them vp, he followed his businesse with hande  & feete, he brake it downe and sette it vp agayne, and that he beganne he ended: and to tel you at a woorde, he was Lorde and King alone, crafte and pollicie he feared none, for his building was so high, that he was without the reche of a broome. Not long after the Gowte spake with the Spider, to whom he magnified his pleasures, hys happinesse and riches: The Spider lykewise wonderfully praysed hys kingdome and libertie in building: They concluded therfore, that whyther so euer they iourneyd, the Gowte should lodge at the riche mans house, and the Spider at the poore mans cottage. Some sorte of men speede better in some place than others, and rich mens houses are a mansion place for disseases: but where least riches are, there is most libertie. The Lyon King of foure feeted beastes, hauing warre with the Foules, sette his armie in aray, ready to ioyne battaill with them: whom the Beare asked what furderance the sluggish Asse, or the fearefull Hare would be, to winne the fielde, bycause he sawe them amongst the other Souldiours. He aunswered hym: The Asse with the sounde of hys Trumpette, shall encourage the Souldiours to fighte: and the Hare, bycause of hys swiftnesse, shall be a Messanger. None is so vile, but he is good for some thing. A certen deuoute man counsailled an olde man to leaue of the lustes of the fleshe, wherevnto he hadde bene outrageously gyuen. He aunswered him: Holly Father, I will obey your reuerende and holesome preceptes, for I perceyue that Uenerie doth much hurte me, neyther am I able to followe that trade any longer. Many abstayne from vyces, wherein they are nooseled, not for the loue of God or goodnesse, but bycause of infirmitie, and feare of punishment. As a sheepherd kept his flocke neere the Sea side, and saw it calme, he desired to be a Marchant venturer, wherevppon he solde his sheepe and bought Dates, and wayed his Anker. It happened, that a sodayne tempeste arose, and that the shippe was in daunger of drowning, so that they were fayne to lighten it of all the burden, scarse able to escape emptie: Shortly after, as one passed by on the Sea shore (for then by chaunce it was calme) he maruelled to see it so still, wherevppon he said, The Sea longeth againe for Dates, and therfore it is so calme. Miserie maketh a man warier. A certen Heremite, being a man of godly liuing, exhorted a Souldiour to leaue of the warfare in this world, which waye very few withoute offending God and hurte of their soule, do walke in, and to gyue him selfe to quietnesse, and prepare for his soules health. I will Father (quod the Souldier) do as ye will me, but truthe is, that in these dayes Souldiours maye neyther demaunde their wages, though it be very small, ne yet take any praie. Many forsake their wicked lyuing, bycause they can vse it no loger. As a Foxe climbed a hedge, hys feete slipped, who (as he was falling) caught holde on a bramble to staye hym: wherefore when he hadde torne hys feete with the prickes thereof, being in payne, he sayd to the Bramble: woo is me, for I came to thee for helpe, who haste hurte mee worse: not so (quod the Briar) thou wast deceyued, for I catche euery thing, and thinkest thou to lay holde on me? Some are so foolishe as to require ayde of those whiche naturally are bent to hurte. The Wagtayle wente to the Phesant and sayd: Ah wretche, why doest thou not wype thyne eyes but lettest them cotinually stande with water? the stenche of thyne eyes make thee lothesome. The Phesant herewith being wrothe, aunswered, How darest thou check me, which art so vyle an outcaste? Thy tayle hath the palsy, and art thou busie to note my fault? Go mende thy owne first, and then mayst thou better heale me. The Wagtayle hearing this, departed ashamed. Hee that will condemne an other, must first be cleare him selfe. The Mise on a tyme contended with the Frogs for the kingdome of the Marshes, wherevppon they proclamed open warre. The battaill being ioyned, at the first onset they behaued themselues so valiauntly, that the victorie was doutful. The wyly Mouse lurking in the grasse, priuilie as it were oute of an Ambushement, assauted the Frogge. But the frog being of strength more puissaunt, in courage and leaping more valiaunt, with open warre prouoked hys enimie: Their speares were bulrushes. It happened, as they were fighting, that a kight espied them a farre of, who incontinently made speede vnto them: but these noble warriours, being earnest in fighting,  & nothing regarding themselues, were snatched vp, and torne in pieces by the Kight. The lyke happeneth to seditious Citizens, whiche being inflamed with the greedie lustes of bearing rule, whiles they stryue eyther with other, who shal be hed officer, do hazard their goods, and commonly their liues. There was sometyme a battaille betwene the beastes and the birds, the victorie was vncertain, for both hoped wel, yet much feare and daunger was, on eyther party. The Batte thinking the birds to be the weaker side, left their companie, and tooke parte with their enimies. The birds by the conducting and gouernement of the Egle wonne the fielde. The Batte was condemned for a runawaye, and banished the companie of all birds, and that from thenceforth he shoulde neuer flye by day lighte, and this was the onely cause, that the Battes flie but by night. He that will not take parte of the sowre, shall not taste of that which is sweete. The Pecocke complayned to Iuno , Sister and wyfe to Iupiter , bycause the Nightingale song so sweete, and she hirselfe for hir horsenesse, was a bywoorde to all men. To whome Iuno sayde: Euery one hath his propre gifte of GOD: The Nightingale in singing, but thou in colours of feathers passest all other birdes, euery man muste be contente with hys estate. What God sendeth, receyue it thankfully, neyther seeke thou further, for God doth nothing vnaduisedly. A certen man wepte and lamented for his wyfe being caried to burying, but hys sonne did sing: whom his Father rebuked, as he had ben madde that he would sing when hys mother went to buriall, whereas he oughte with him to be heauy and lamente. Why Father (quod he) if thou haue hyred these Priestes to sing, why arte thou angry with mee that sing for nothing? That is no parte of thy office sayd his Father, but belongeth to the Priest. All things are not seemely for all men. On a tyme Heauen poured on Earthe many stormes, lightning, and thundring, wherewith he oppressed it. But she being angry, called the Aire to hir, and sayd Brother I praye thee meddle not betwixt Heauen and me, for I meane to ouerthrowe him, bycause he hath wrought me such iniurie, that I would fayne by all meanes be reuenged. Ah sister (quod the Aire) do not so, but pacifie thy wrath, for though that Heaue haue vexed thee now, you shal an other time be mery togyther. Yet Earth being impatient, woulde not yelde, but armed him selfe and began too warre with heauen. The aire beholding that, sent such a darke miste, yt the earthe coulde not discerne where heauen was. This darknesse continued so long betwene heauen and earth, till the earthes fury was past: after which time the aire sent oute his windes, whiche draue away the mist. All men ought to quenche fire, and not to kindle it. A Lyon enamoured with a Countreymans daughter, desired hir greatly, wherevpon he requested hir father to giue hir to him in mariage. What (quod the man) should I mary my daughter to a beaste? Then the Lyon frowned  & grinded his teeth at him, wherewith the countreyman being afraid, went from his former talke, & sayd: I would gladly match 1 2 gree, that as I occupie the daye, so thou maist runne thy race in the night. Let vs obey oure Creator, and be not lofty ouer me, but suffer mee to gyue light in the daye, and to preserue the good creatures of the Lorde. The Moone herewith beyng more vexed, departed in a chafe, and called to hir the starres, of whiche she gathered a great armie, and beganne battaile with the Sunne, against whom she shot hir arrowes, and endeuored with hir dartes to stryke him. But the Sunne being aboue hir and at the vauntage, came downe, and with a swoorde deuided the Moone in two, & threw down the starres, saying: In lyke maner I will vse thee, as often as thou arte rounde: whereof (as reporte goeth) it came to passe, that the Moone continueth not alwayes full, and that the starres do vse to fall. The Moone therfore hauing the ouerthrowe, was ashamed and sayde: Better it is, when I am full to be deuided, than altogyther to be abolished. Lykewyse many proude persons would be Rulers alone, and can not abyde to haue any their better or lyke to them. A Spider offended with the Swallow, bycause she deuoured the flies which were his meate, hanged vp hys webbes afore the hole, (from whence the Swallowe should flie) to take hir. The Swallow flew forth and caried away ye webbe with the weauer. Then the Spider hanging in the aire and perceyuing his death to be at hande, sayde: Iustly haue I thys deserued, which did thinke to catch great birds, when without great labor I could scarse get the smallest thing that flieth. Attempt nothing aboue thy capacitie. As a Dogge slept in a court before the house of hys maister, a Wolfe came sodenly and caught hym: whome, as he would haue killed, the Dogge besought, saying: Good maister spare me nowe bycause I am leane  & thinne as thou seest, but if thou wilt tary, there shall be within these fewe dayes a great mariage kept at my Lordes, where I will so fill me and make me so fat, that then I shall doe thee more good. The Wolfe crediting his wordes, let him goo. Shortly after, the Wolfe came and founde the dog sleeping vpon the house toppe, to whom he called as he stoode beneath, willing him to performe his promisse: Nay verily (quod the Dog) but if from henceforth thou finde me sleeping without doores, tary not at all vpon hope of any mariage. The burnt hand euer after feareth the fire. An Asse put on a Lyons skinne and walked abroade, putting all other beastes in feare, who on a tyme seeing a Fox, endeuoured to make him also afrayed. But hee (for by chaunce he heard him braye) sayd to him: Thou knowest well that I would haue trembled at thee, if I had not heard thy braying. Some vnlearned men whiche outwardly beare coutenance, through their babling are reproued. The Pye sometyme desired the Egle, to make him one of his friends of hys housholde, bycause the beauty of hys body deserued it, and also the redinesse of his speach to do messages: I woulde so doo, sayd the Egle, but I feare least that which I speak within doores, thou wouldest preache it abroad on the house tops. Keepe no bablers nor teltales in thy house. A Nightingale espying a Kyte flying abroad in the aire, & making a great crying was sore afrayde, to whome the Thrushe sayde: Feare not sister, for this preparation to fight & these threatnings will light at length, eyther on a little mouse, or a chicken, we must take heede of the Hauke, whose gripes we shal first feele, ere we heare his voyce. Quiet and close men are more to be dreaded, than threatners & great pratlers. A Coutryman ready to passe a streame, which by chaunce was sodenly rysen, with late rayne that fell, sought the shallow. When he had assayed that parte of the Riuer which was calmest, he founde it deeper than he supposed: agayn, where it was roughest, there he foud it shallowest, than he bethought hym whyther he might committe hys life to the calmest place of the water, or to the roughest. Dread those lesse whiche are full of wordes and threatnings, than those that say nothing. A Hart escaping the hunters, lay hidde vnder a vine. When they were a litle past hir, she supposing she lay safe, began to feede on the vine leaues. Which being stirred, the Hunters returned: and iudging (as it was in deede) some beaste to lurke vnder the leaues, they with their arrowes slew the harte: who as she lay a dying, sayd thus: Rightly am I serued, for I ought not to haue hurte that which saued me. They which do any wrong to their benefactors, are punished of god. A certen man being bitten by a Dog, wente aboute seeking for helpe. At length one met hym, who as soone as he vnderstood what he would, sayde to him: If thou wouldest be healed, thou shalt need no surgion: only let ye dog which bit thee licke the bloud from thy sore, for better remedie than this can not be founde. The other smyling at him sayd: If I do so, I shall be bitten of Dogs dayly more and more. Naughty men hauing receyued good turnes, are the sooner ready to render displeasure. An Asse serued a certen man many yeares, in which time he neuer offended him. It happened afterwarde, being heauy laden, that he stumbled in a rough way, and fell vnder hys burthen. Then his cruell Maister bette him sore, and in spite of his harte forced him to ryse, calling him a slouthfull and sluggish beast: but this poore wretch thought thus with him selfe: Miserable is my estate, which haue happened to so vnkinde a Maister, for though I haue serued him a long time without displeasing him, yet doth he not forgyue me this one faulte, in recompece of the good seruice that I haue done him. This Fable is against those, which forgette the benefites that they haue receyued, and greuously punishe the least offence of their benefactors toward them done. A Mouse espied the Kight taken in a Foulers grin, on whom he toke compassion, (though he were hys moste enimie) and gnewe the knots in pieces, and set him at libertie. The Kight remembring the good turn no loger than it was in doing: When he perceyued him selfe loose, layd holde on the poore Mouse, and with his talents tore him in pieces. Wicked men in like manner are wont to recompence theyr benefactors. A Husbandman being stoong by a Bee, maruelled that oute of the selfe same mouth so sweete iuyce proceeded, and so grieuous a sting. The Bee aunswered, the more beneficiall I am, ye more I hate them, which do me wrong. The more good men doo, the lesse iniurie they endure. The propertie of Abrotanum , is to drawe oute any thing that sticketh fast, with the helpe of Auxangia . Wherfore on a tyme came a Hare halting to him, for a thorne which stuck in his foote, and sayde: O Phisitian both of body and soule, take pitie on me and helpe me, and forthwith shewed his right foote. This tree being moued with compassion, put him selfe vpon the wounde, brought oute the thorne and healed it. Wherfore the Hare remembring thys benefite, caried dayly a flaggo of water on his shoulders, and watered the roote of the tree, wherby he caused it to continue fresh and greene. Let vs alwayes gladly serue our benefactors. As the Crowe was offering sacrifice to Minerua , she bad the Dog to hir good cheare, but he aunswered hir: Why doest thou bestowe sacrifice to no purpose? For the Goddesse so hateth thee, that she suffereth thee to haue no credit in any diuination. To whome the Crowe sayd, for that cause the more do I sacrifice vnto hir, that I might get hir fauour agayne. Many for aduauntage, feare not to benefite their enimies. A Hunter hadde caught a Partriche, whiche as hee would haue killed, she besought him pardon for hir lyfe,  & to set hir at libertie, promising to bring to hys net many Partriches: The Fouler answered hir redily agayn, saying: I think that nowe thou arte more woorthy of death: bicause thou hast giuen thy woord to betray thy friend. He whiche goeth about by deceyt to vndoo his friend, runneth headlong into miserie. A certeyne Dolphin finding an Eele in the sea, pursued after hir, whome when he had often caught, but could not holde, bycause of hir slippernesse, he was wonderfull sory. But the Eele being disposed to mock him, and therby to escape, spake craftely to the Dolphin: I am sorie for thee, that thou art too muche weeryed and greeued with swimming after mee, but thy labor is lost: for in the deepe waters thou shalte neuer take mee, but goe with me into the mudde, and thou shalte haue mee at thy plesure. The foolish Dolphin being in a chafe, and also greedie of his praie, began to swim after hir, intending vtterly to destroy hir: when the Ele had led the Dolphin into shallow places she wounde hir selfe into the mudde, and sayd: Come vp to me, for I shal be stayed by the rootes of herbes,  & thou shalt haue thy desire of mee. The Dolphin gaue a skip to catch the Eele, but she skipt into the mud, and she stack fast on dry groud: In the meane tyme came a Fisher, and strake him thorough, wherof he dyed. He that goeth with his foe, it is no maruell if he fall. Many Trees grewe togyther in one grounde, tall, streight, and withoute knottes, amongst whom there was one tree low, crooked and knotty, whome for his deformitie the other mocked. It hapned that the lord of the soyle wold buylde an house, for whiche he commaunded all those trees to bee cutte downe, saue that which for his shortnesse and mishapyng, woulde disfigure the house: when the other were hewed downe, the euill fauoured tree sayd thus with himselfe: Of thee Nature wil I no longer complayn, that I am mishape, seing that such fayre trees are always in daunger. Lette no man bee greeued in that beautie hurteth many. The Foxe oftentymes vpraided ye Lionesse, that she had but one whelpe at a tyme, truthe it is (quod she) but then that is a Lyon. Beautie cosisteth not in plentie, but in vertue. A certen Astronomer diligently vewing the starres, vnwittingly fell into a well, but a Trauailer by chaunce comming by, and seeing him sighing, sayde: Doest not thou see the earth, whiche gauest thy minde vpward? Many boast that they knowe of things to come, not knowing what presently happeneth. A certeine Wheelewright had ben often deluded by Schollers, that were vagabuds, which came to him for almes saying they had greate skill in Magike, and that they could doe many thyngs: of which number, ther came one a begging to his doore, in the name of a Maister of the seuen liberal Arts, to whom he sayd: My friende, were not you here the laste yeare? No (quod the Scholer:) departe therfore (quod he) & come no more here, for I will giue thee nothing. The Scholler was offended, & asked why he spake in the singular number to him, beeing a Master of the seuen liberall Artes, and a Magitian. He answered: I know much more than thou doest: for with one handiecraft labour I fynd me, my wyfe and children, but thou with thy seuen Artes canst not fynde thy selfe, but goest a begging. Wherefore thou oughtest to reuerence me, and not I thee. When hee had so sayde, the Scholer departed, well mocked. It is a folly too boast of any title, where as knowledge wanteth of that which is professed. A certein ragged and yll fauored man came into a Tauerne, and bicause he was lightly regarded, began to boast of his nobilitie, that he descended of an auncient house, to whome one aunswered: Auaunt knaue with thy nobilitie, oure Millers Asse is more noble than thou, for he goth with a man wayting on him, but thou goest without. A certein man who hauing trauailed far, returned into his coutrey, & made great vaunts of his manly acts yt he had done in many places, especially yt he had daunced a dauce at Rhodes , that none of yt place could: for proof wherof, he sayd, yt he had to witnesse the which wer there present, to whom one of them that stoode by, answered: Sir, if this be true, what needeth witnesse, there stands Rhodes , and there is thy daunce. All talke is superfluous, except we haue present proofe. The Mole a blynd beast, sayde sometyme to hir mother: I see a Mulbery tree, & streight after, I smell a gret sauor of Frankincense: but the third time shee said, I heere the noyse of the fall of an yron pellet: hir mother answered: As far as I perceiue, thou lackest not onely thy sight, but also thy smelling and hearing. Some brag they can doo things impossible, & in the least are reproued. The talke was somtime that the hills did trauayle, whereof men hearing, came thither, and stoode gaping aboute wayting for some monstrous thing, not without great feare. At length the hilles were deliuered, and broughte foorth a Mouse: wherat there fel such a laughter amongst the, yt they were redy to sowne. Crakers will promise greate matters, but scarse perform the least. A Frog came foorth of the marishes into the wood amongst wild beasts, and sayd shee was well seene in phisicke, and that hir cunning was as good as Hipocrates , or Galenes : all beasts gaue credit, only the Fox mocked hir saying: shal shee be counted skilful in phisicke, whose lips bee so pale? Let hir first heale hir selfe. And thus the Foxe mocked hir. For the mouth of a Frog is of a skye colour. It is mere folly to professe that wherof thou hast no skill. A Pecoke boasted too a Souldyer that had decked his hat with Estriche feathers, that she had much fairer feathers: and to verifie hir saying, she spreade abroade hir tayle: The Souldiour therewith being inamored, caught and spoyled hir, wherewith he decked his helmet: Then the Pecoke sayd to hirselfe: wo is me wretch & foole, too shew so precious a thing to a spoyler, which I ought to haue kept close. By boasting of precious things many are stirred to become theeues. As a Kid looked out of a windowe, he espyed a wolf passing by, vpon whom he rayled: Ah vngracius persone, sayde the wolf, it is not thou that tauntest me, but thy safe holde. Sometyme the Sunne and the Northeast winde contended, who was the stronger, whervpon they agreed to proue their strength on a wayfaring man, that he might haue the victorie whiche caused him to cast away his wallet. Firste the Northeast winde with sharpe stormes  & bitter blastes assayed him: He stayed not a whit therefore, but as he wente, he wrapped hys clothes double about hym: When the Sun was come to his course, by litle & litle in spreading his beames, hee calmed the wind, then was this man in such a heate and swet, that he puffed & blowed exceedingly, and at length by the outragiousnesse thereof, being fainte, he could go no further, but got him into the coole shadowe, casting away his wallet, and sat him downe vnder a thicke wood: by which euident token, the Sunne was conquerer. Looke afore thou leape, for though thou be strog, yet perhaps another is stroger than thou, if not stronger, yet craftier, with his pollicie to gyue thee the foyle. The Foxe passing by a farme house, espied a great route of women eating Hens sumptuously prepared, but (God wot) there was no talke amongst them, to whom she sayd: what crying and barking of dogs would be after me if I shold doo as ye doo? Thou wicked beast (quod an old woman) we eate that is our own, but thou stealest from others. We may not be so bolde with other mens goods, as ye right owners. A great barking Dog was a sore enimie to the Wolues, for when they would haue entred the citie, he kept them out: wherfore they also hated the dogge, whom they would fayne haue killed. At length they sent two Ambassadours to ye Dog, desiring him to come abroad into ye fields, and they would make him their king, bycause he was mighty and valiaunt: The foolish curre consented & went with them, whom they brought safely to ye other wolues that tare him in pieces. Hee that will be hardy, let him keepe him selfe in a sure defence. The Pecocke and the Crane somtyme supped togither,  & amogst other talke, the Pecocke bragged muche of his fayre tayle, despising the Crane: he graunted yt she was a faire birde in that pointe, yet was he able with his stoute flying, to enter amongst the clouds, when she coulde scarse flye to the house toppe. Let not one thinke scorne of another, euery one hath his proper gift & vertue: for he that wateth thy qualitie, perhaps hath ye which thou lackest. There dwelt a Knight at Florence , descended of a noble bloud, whiche had a wayward and brauling wife that dayly went to hir ghostly Father, to whom she complayned of hir husbads demeanure: for which he much blamed the Knight. It happened not long after, that she desired hir ghostly father to set hir  & hir husband at quiet, wherevppon he called him to shrift, saying, that if he came, he doubted not but to make them friendes againe. The Knight agreeing, the other required him to make declaration of his faultes. In fayth (quod ye knight) it shall not need, for I know that my wife hath often tolde thee al that euer I did, yea and more too. harpe: he was borne in the citie of Methimne in the Isle of Lesbos , whom Periander King of Corinthe loued for his cunnings sake, from whom he departed to see the famous countrey of Sicili and Italie . When he was come thyther,  & had well delighted the eares, and contented the minds of most mein those partes, he gayned greatly, and liued in pleasure & loue of all men. Afterwarde hauing gathered much substance, he minded to returne to Corinth , whervpon he hired a Corinthian ship and mariners of that coaste, bycause he hoped to find friendship at their hands. The Corinthians receyued him, and lauched into the deepe, who being greedy of this great praie of money, tooke counsell to kill Arion . He vnderstanding of hys destruction, gaue them al the money that he had, praying them only to saue his life. But being past hope and sore afrayde, he requested that before his death, he might put on his apparell and take his Harpe  & sing a mourning song to cofort hys harte withall: The Mariners (though they were hard harted and cruell) desiring to heare him, graunted his petitio. He being clad as he was accustomed, standing in ye hinder part of the ship, song with a loude voyce, the song called Orithium . In the end of his song, as he stood with his harpe and in his clothes, he cast him selfe intoo the Sea. The shipmen nothing doubting but that he was drowned, kept on their voyage. But a straunge and wonderfull thing happened, for a Dolphin sodeynly swam by  & receyued him, caried hym on his backe aboue the water, and brought him safe & soud to Tenarus , in the land of Laconia: fro whece Arion went straight to Corinthe , and shewed him selfe to King Periander , and howe he was caried of the Dolphin, declaring all that happened. The King little beleeued this, but commaunded him safely to be kept til ye truth were tried. The mariners were sought for (and Arion sent out of the way) who being brought before the king, he demauded of them (making no semblant that he had knowledge of Arion ) whyther they hearde any thing of him in the parties whence they came: they aunswered, that when they set foorth he was in Italie , and liued wel there, and was highly esteemed in the cities: and also was exceeding rich. Whiles they thus spake, in came Arion with his Harpe, hauing on the same apparell wherewith he lept into the Sea, wherby the shipme being amazed,  & pricked in conscience, could not denie it. In brute beasts we shall somtyme finde more friendshippe, than in couetous men, which care for nothing but riches, neyther haue any sparke of humanitie, but the only phisnomie. A Kid straying fro the flock, and being pursued by a Wolf, turned backe to him & sayde: O wolf, bycause I am persuaded yt thou shalt eate mee, play first on thy pipe that I may daunce, least I die in sorow: As the wolf was playing and the Kid daucing, ye dogs heard it & chased the wolf: who sayd to the kid: I haue well deserued this, for I ought not being a cooke, to counterfet a minstrell. They whiche regarde not that whervnto thei are naturally inclined, but assaye that which to others belongeth, fall into aduersitie. A Crab fish came forth of the sea & fed, the Foxe being hungry & seeing him, caught him: who being ready to be deuoured, sayd: I am wel serued, which being a fishe of the sea, would liue on land. Those me are iustly miserable, ye forsaking their proper sciece, doo medle wt that, which becommeth them not. The Pomgranat and the Apple tree cotended aboute their beautie: When they hadde continued long in stryfe togyther, a bush, which was their neighbour, often hearing them, at length sayd: It is tyme friends to be at one. The vilest persons sometyme will medle in their betters matters. A certen man had a Dog whome he alwayes fed with his owne handes, bycause he should loue him the more, and when he was bound he loosed him: But yet he comaunded hys seruant to tye him vp, and beate him, to the ende the dogge might perceyue he loued him,  & that hys seruant did not. The dog taking it greeuously to be dayly tied and beaten, ranne away. Whom when his maister rebuked as a churle and forgetfull of all his benefites, that he would run away from him which loued him so, and fed him, whome he neuer bound nor bet. Ah sir (sayd the dog) that your seruant doth at your commaundement, I count it done by you. Those are euill doers, whiche are causers of euill. A certen Turtle being a widowe, lyued in great heauinesse for the death of hir mate, but she remayned chast: who other birds pitying, desired hir to abyde with them, wherevnto at length she consented: They made hir the beste cheere they could, but she seeing their abhomination and whoordom, forsooke them, and led the rest of hir lyfe in chast widowhed. Who protesteth chastitie, must set his mynde on no worldly affaires. A certein man had a scold to his wife, whiche alwayes brauled with him, what soeuer he did, whiche the more hee bet hir, the more fierce shee was. When he saw that stripes would not preuayle, he attempted an other way, for as often as shee chid, he played on a payre of Bagpypes, wherof he had no skill. When hee had so done, she was more fierce: but at lengthe he continuing his playing, shee daunced for anger,  & in the end she stroke the Bagpype out of his had. But he tooke it agayne, and played, wherwith shee being chafed, ran oute of the doores, saying, that shee woulde not endure his wickednesse and dronkennesse. The next day she began hir scolding afreshe, but hir husband played as he was wont. Then the woma declared that she was ouercome, and left of hir cursing, promising hir husband to become most gentle vnto him, so that he woulde lay away his Bagpype. Malaperte women by dyuers wayes must be charmed. Twoo haukes being confederate togither, codesceded to deuide their praie equally. When they hunted on a tyme, they caught a Quayle from hir nest, too whom they sayd: Choose whether we shal eat thee alone, or else bring vs to thy nest that wee may eate thy yong ones wyth thee. The Quayle aunswered: I am in trouble on euery side, and what I shall doo I can not tell: it is better to fall into theyr handes alone, than to dye with my yong ones: but before they killed hir, she sayd: Better it is to suffer a little harme than a woorse. Of two euills the least is to chosen. The Wolfe sometyme hadde killed a sheepe, which as hee greedely deuoured, by chauce the bones stuck fast in his throate: hee trauayled far and neere seeking for help but founde none, for all me iudged hym well serued for his greedynesse. At length by fayre flattring words, and greater promyses, hee allured the Crane too thrust his long neck intoo his throate, and to plucke out the bone that stucke fast. When the Crane had so done he required a rewarde: But the Wolfe laughed him to scorn, saying: Be packing thou patch, canst thou not be cotent with thy lyfe, thou arte bounde to thanke mee therfore: for had I list, I might haue bitten off thy necke. All is lost that is put in a riuen dishe. A Fisher cast his hookes into the water bayted wyth fleshe, wherewith he caught a litle fish, the prisoner besoughte him to release him, now being so little, and too lette hym growe bygger, that heereafter hee might haue the more commoditie of him: Nay sayde the Fisher, I will not bye the pigge in the poke, for I vse too take what presently I can get. Leaue not the bird in the hand, for that in the bushe. The Fox being entred a countreymas house, found a Henne sitting on Egs in the nest, whiche besought him, saying: I pray thee kill me not now being leane, tary a while till my chickens be hatched, which thou mayst eat without any toothake being yong: Ah (quod he) I were not woorthy too be called a Fox, if now being hungry, I would forsake my praie that is redy, vpon hope of chickens which are not yet oute of the shell: I haue strong teeth, which are able to grynd the hardest fleshe that is. And when he had so sayd, he deuoured the Henne. He is not wise, which vpon vncertayn hope of greater things, wyll let go that which he hath presently. The Frogs being free besought Iupiter too giue them a kyng, hee laughed at theyr foolish petition, neuerthelesse they continued theyr instante sute so long, that at the length they forced hym therevnto. He cast them down a beame, which with the fall thereof made a great noyse in the water. The Frogs being afrayde hild their peace, and did homage to their king, and approched by litle and litle nerer vntoo him. At length they boldly hopped vp and downe on him: and thus their foolish kyng became a laughing stock vnto them. Then called they on Iupiter ageyne, desiring of him a valiant king-He sent them the Storke, who walked lyke a stoute champion through the Marshes killing and deuouring as many Froggs as he met. At euen when the Stork was gone too rest, they came foorth of their holes, hoarsly crying, but to a deade man, for Iupiter his wil was, seing they were not content with a mercifull kyng, that they should be oppressed with a tyrant. The like hapneth too the common people, which hauing a merciful and gentle Prince, iudge hym a dastard and slouthful, and pray that they may haue a stoute prince. Ageyne hauing a valiant Prince, they dispraise his crueltie, praysing the others clemency. Eyther it is, that wee are not cotented with things present: or that is true, seldome commeth the better. A Colyer sometime desired a Fuller to dwell with hym in house togyther: Nay (sayd the Fuller) this neyther pleaseth me, nor yet is for my profite. For I feare greately least that whiche I make cleane, thou shouldest raye as blacke as a coale. Wee are heereby warned too keepe company with those that be of a perfect honest lyfe, and to shunne the felowship of leude men, as a noysome plague. A Shepherd finding a Wolues whelp, brought him home, and kept him among his doggs that were a sauegarde for the shepe, which being well growne, began to kil sheepe, and to teach the dogs to eate with him, whiche thing the shepherd marking, killed the Wolf, but yet he could not make the dogs leaue killing of sheepe. Then sayd the shepherd, worthily am I thus serued, bycause I put a Wolfe amongst the Dogs, whiche hath taught them too kill sheepe. The fellowship of euill men corrupteth good manners. A Rauen sometyme folowed Wolues ouer manye high hills, wherfore hee required to be part taker of theyr praie, bycause he had so far followed them, neither had left their copanie. The Wolues made light of hym, bycause he followed not the, but their praie, & in yt he wold as soon deuoure the harts of wolues, if they should be slayn, as of any other beast. We must alwayes mark not yt we doo, but of what mynde we are in doing. A husband man had many yong men to his sons, which wer always at variace, whom hee diligently endeuored to vnite in loue toogether, and bycause hee wold plainly ope to the the incouenieces of theyr discord, hee brought a bundell of small sticks, whiche he comaunded them to bynde with a little corde, and then to breake it in peeces: they being but yong and weake, did their good wyll to breake it, but coulde not preuayle: Then theyr father loosed it, and gaue euery of them a little rod therof, which euery one according to his strength did easily breake: and foorth with he sayde to them: Sonnes, if ye would agree, and sticke thus one to an other, no man were able to vanquishe you: but if ye be eyger to hurt and pursue one an other with mortal hatred, ye shal soone be a praie for your enimie. By concord small thyngs encrease. By discord great thyngs wast and consume. Ther were foure Bulls which agreeed to sticke one too an other as well in wealth as in woe, whome the Lyon perceiued feeding together, and therfore was afraide too assaile them though hee were verie hungry: but in the ende he deuised by some crafty way to seuer them: whom after they were parted he soon tore them in peeces. Nothing is surer than concord and discord maketh the mighty weak. The Wolf and the Fox entred fellowship, and went a hunting, to whome, as they were diuiding the Harte whiche they had taken, the Lion came by chauce, and chalenged the third part of the praie, bycause he was king of foure footed beastes: but the Wolf denyed it: then the Lion being angry, layd hold on the Wolfe with his clawes, and plucked the skinne cleane from his head, and made it redde, whereby the Wolfe escaped scarse with his life. After the Lion turned to the Fox and sayde: What sayest thou? Forsooth my lorde the Kyng (quod he) I graunte not only ye third part, but also the whole Hart vnto you: What (quod the Lion) hath any body taught thee to answere so wysely: Yea sir, (sayde the Foxe:) The redde hatte which you put on my fellow the Wolfe hath taught me. Better it is somtime to graut a part than to leese the whole. The Snayle being offended that he cotinually abode in moyst and low places, desired the Egle, (of whome he had heard, that shee flewe so hygh, that shee myght beholde the greatest parte of the Earth on euery side) to cary hym vp on high, wherby he myghte at once beholde both Hilles and Ualleys, the Fields and the Sea. Whiche thing, when the Egle hadde quickly done, shee cast him downe, whereby he fell on the grounde, and was dashed in peeces. Let no ma exalt himself higher than his state & nature doth require. In time past the Doues kept war with the Kyte, whom bicause they woulde vanquishe, they chose the Hauke too bee theyr Kyng. When hee was come to the kingdome, hee was rather a mortall enimie to them than a King, he caughte and destroyed them as fast as the Kite. Then the Doues were wonderful sory for that they had doone, and iudged it muche safer for them to haue endured the perpetuall warres of the Kite, than the tyranie and oppression of the Hauke. Let no man bee too much grieued wyth hys estate, for nothyng is blessed on euery syde. A certeyne husbandman was discontented, that he dayly ploughed his earth, and could attayn no great wealth through his toyling, & had seen some souldiers whiche when warre was broken vp, had so encreased theyr substance, that they went wel apparailed, fared sumptuously, and liued in all pleasure. Wherevppon hee solde his Sheepe, Goates, and Oxen, and bought horse and Armoure, and went a warfare, where, bycause he played not the man as he ought, he was spoyled of al that he had & wounded sore: then he misliked warfare, and mynded to occupye marchandise, hoping for greater gayne & lesse payne: when he had sold his Farme, and laded his shyppe with marchandise, he launched out into the deepe, where sodeynly there arose a great tempest of weather, the shyp was drowned, and he with all his companie were caste away. Let euery man be content with his estate, seing that miserie is euery where at hand. The Hare and the Foxe made theyr peticions too Iupiter , the one desired swiftnesse to his subtiltie, the other subtiltie to his swiftnesse: Iupiter aunswered them: In the begynning of ye world, wee gaue euery beaste his propre gifte bountifully: now if one should haue had all, other had ben wronged. God hath bestowed his gifts so indifferently vpon euery ma, that we ought with our state to be satisfied. There sprong vp an Elme in the bank of a Riuer, whiche mocked an Osier that grew next him, for his weakenesse, bicause that with the least beating of the water he moued, but of his own stregth and stoutnesse he boasted excedingly, and howe that he had continued there many yeares not able to be shaken by the violence of the water. It hapned on a tyme, that by force of the waues he was broke downe, and caried away by the streame: Then the Osier mocked hym, saying: Whither away neyghbour, wilte thou nowe forsake me? Where is nowe thy strength become? Those men are wiser that giue place to their betters, than they that doo contende and haue a fowle ouerthrowe. The Serpente and the Crab being entred friendship, liued together. The Crab being a true meaner, exhorted him to leaue off his gyle: but he would not obey him: the Crab therfore watched him, when he was a sleepe, and as well as hee coulde pressed hym downe and slue hym, he seeing the serpent when he was deade, sayd: Thou oughtest afore too haue bene strayght and simple, and then thou hadst escaped this punishment. They which go craftily to their friends, doo rather hurt them selues. A Hart sometyme accused a Shepe before the Wolfe, that he ought hym a bushell of wheate: The Sheepe in very deede knew nothing of this, yet for feare of the Wolfe promysed payment. A day was set, which being come, the Hart put the Shepe in remembraunce therof, she denyed it, excusing that promise too bee made for feare of the Wolues presence. Forced promises are not to be kept. It is a clause of the lawe, force must haue the repulse by force. But thereof cometh a new sentence: It is lawfull to paye craft with the lyke. As a Woodfeller was cuttyng wood neere a riuer side, he lost his axe, who being vncertayne what to doe, sate hym downe on the riuers banke and wepte. But Mercurius vnderstanding the cause, & moued with pitie, diued vnder the water, broughte vp a golden axe, and asked him, if that were it whiche he loste: Hee denyed it too bee his: then hee dyued ageyne, and brought vp one of Siluer, the whiche hee refused too bee his, then hee dyued the thyrde tyme, and tooke vp his Axe, whiche he acknowledged to be his which he lost. Mercurius perceyuing him too bee a iust man and a true, gaue them all vnto hym, who foorthewith came too hys fellowes, and shewed them what hadde happened vnto hym. One of them bycause hee woulde also trye it, came to the Ryuer, and cast in his Axe willingly: then satte hym downe and wepte. Unto whome when Mercurius had appeared, and vnderstode the cause, he lykewyse dyued, and broughte vp a golden Axe, whiche he asked, if hee hadde loste: He reioycing, dyd affirme it too bee his. Whose impudent and manyfest falshod Mercurie perceyuing, neyther gaue hym the golden axe, nor his owne. How muche GOD loueth the ryghtuous, so muche hee hateth the vnryghtuous. The Foxe beeing sometyme very hungry, thoughte by suttletie too get his pray amongst the Hennes, which by the conduction of the Cocke were flowne into a hygher tree than hee coulde clymbe: whervpon he came to the Cocke, whome he gently saluted, and sayde: What makest thou so hygh? Hast thou not hearde the newes of late, whiche are so good for vs? Uerely (quod the Cocke) I heard nothing: but I praye thee what are they? The Foxe sayde: I am come hyther to make thee pryuie of oure ioy: For there was lately a generall Counsell helde of all Beastes, wherein was concluded a continuall peace betweene all Beastes: so that nowe withoute any manner of feare, molestation, or laying awayte of any, euery one may walke where as he list in safetie and quietnesse, therefore come downe and lette vs keepe holy this day. The Cocke perceyuing the subtiltie and crafte of the Foxe, sayde to him: Thy tydings are very good, whiche also I do lyke well: and foorthwith he stretched out his necke, and looked a farre off, as though he sawe some straunge thing, whom the Foxe asked, what he espied? The Cocke aunswered, I see two dogges comming amayne with open mouth: the Fox therewt quaking for feare bad them Adieu, for tyme it is for me to be gone, & foorthwt tooke him to his feete: What sir (quod the Cocke) whyther runnest thou? what fearest thou? thou needest doubt nothing, if this peace be concluded: verily (quod ye Fox) I can not tell whither these Dogs haue heard of this decree or not. Wherby one craft was paid with ye like. There was a certeyn man who sowed leade and other trifles in a peece of lether, as though it had ben som Iewel, & in the sight of a riche marchaunt & other men, he priuilie threw it to the ground, & after tooke it vp agayne, inquiring if any had lost it: This riche man being couetous, came and affirmed it to be his: to whom the deceyuer sayd: Is it a precious thing as it seemeth? The Marchaunt auouched it to bee. Mary (quod the other) thou shalt not haue it agayne except thou giue mee .x. Crownes for a reward, which he willingly gaue, & forthwith departed & opened the leather, but he perceyuing it to be a small trifle, went to the Deceyuer, alleaging yt he was beguiled, wherefore he threatned to hang him, excepte he restored the .x. Crownes. Why (quod the deceyuer) didst thou craftly and falsly saye it was thine? and he caught holde on his hand and would haue brought him before ye maior to trie their honestie, but ye marchaut plucked back his hand & ran away. A Foxe counterfeyting that she was dead, to the ende to entrap the birdes which should come to hir as to a dead carcase, being walowed in durt, did lie with hir face vpwarde in a field, wayting for Choughes and Rauens, & suche like greedy birdes, whiche she would deuoure. It happened a dog to come by, whiche snatched at hir and with his teeth tore hir. Wherat she sayd: I am worthily serued, for whiles I endeuoure subtilly to catche birds, my self am caught by an other. They which lie in wayte for other, ought not to be greeued if they bee entrapped them selues. A Boy sat weeping on the brinke of a Well, whom a Theefe demauded the cause thereof. Mary (quod he) as I drew water my rope brake, and a pot of gold is fallen in. This theefe beleeuing him, put of his clothes and lept into the Well to seeke it: which, bycause he founde not, he came vp again, where he coulde neyther see the Boy nor his cote, for the Boy was gone with it. Hee that vseth deceipt, somtime is deceyued. The Thrush made his vaunts yt he had won the friendship of the Swallow, to whom his mother sayde: Thou arte a foole sonne, if thou think to liue with hir, seeing eyther of you desireth contrarie places, for she abideth in hot places, but thou in colde. Make not those thy friendes, whose liuing disagreeth from thine. The Aire on a time cited the winde before the Iudge & maker of all things, and sayd: O Lorde of all things, beholde and take pitie of me, ye haue placed me Princelyke inough, for which I giue you thanks, bycause ye haue appointed me to be the life of all liuing things, but herein I was deceyued, for this wind doth make me so cold and intemperate, therefore I say to him, if he presume fro hencefoorth to blowe vpon me, I will choke him: to whom the Creator sayd: Aire thou sayst ill, though the winde make thee colde and tosse thee, yet he maketh thee holsome and temperate. If the wind blew not on thee, thou shouldest be corrupt, lothsome, infected and hated of all men: wherfore thou oughtest to loue him whiche preserueth thy health, wherewith the Aire was at one with the Winde. We ought to loue, and paciently suffer them which correct vs. A wayfaring man hauing trauayled farre, vowed, if he found any thing to offer the half thereof to Mercurius . He found a bag full of Almonds and Dates, whiche he tooke and eate: but the Date stones and shells of the Almonds he layd vppon an Altare, saying: Thou haste O Mercury , my vowe, for with thee I partake both the outside  & the inside of that I found. The Fable is against couetous men, whiche for couetousnesse deceyued the Gods. A certen Widowe had a Hen, whiche day by daye laid an egge: she supposing, if she gaue hir more barley, that she would lay twise a day, did so: but the hen being fat, could not lay once a day. Sometime they loose the present commoditie, which through couetousnesse seeke after more. A couetous man hauing solde all hys goods, made a wedge of golde, whiche in a certein place he buried togither wt his soule & mind, to which he dayly went to see it: One of the workmen watching him on a time, and perceyuing what was done, digged vp the wedge and caried it away: afterward he came, who seeing the place empty, began to lament and plucke him self by the haire. Whe one saw him thus weeping, and vnderstoode the cause thereof, he sayd: Friend be not sory, for hauing golde, thou hadst it not, take therfore a stone, and hide it for thy gold: and suppose that it is golde, and it shall be all one to thee for as I perceyue, whe it was golde, thou didst not occupie it. It auayleth nothing to be endued with possessions, except we haue the vse thereof A Chough seeing Doues in a certeyn douehouse wel kept, coloured him self white, and wet thyther, bicause he would be partaker of their foode. They as long as he helde his peace, supposing him to be a Doue, receyued him into their companie. But he forgetting him self on a time chatted, whose nature they then knowing, bette him and draue him away: Of which meate being depriued, he returned to ye Choughs: they bicause of his colour not knowing him, draue him fro feeding with them: so coueting both, enioyed neyther. We must be content with our owne, considering that couetousnesse, besides that it nothing auayleth, sometime is the cause to loose the preseut good that we haue. As a Dog by chaunce swam ouer the Riuer, he caried in his iawes a piece of flesh. The sunne then shyning, as comonly it happeneth, the shadowe thereof appeared in the water: which when hee had seene, supposing it to be another piece of flesh, snatched greedely thereat, & so lost that he had in his iawes. The Dog being stroken at the harte, bothe with the losse of his fleshe and also of his foolishe hope, barked thus in his language: Ah wretch, whiche lackedst a measure in thy greedie desire. Thou hadst inough and too much hadst thou not doted, nowe throughe thy follie thou hast nothing left thee. We are warned of modestie and wisedome, in desiring and eschuing of things, and to vse a meane in our desires. A certe couetous man being sent Embassadour for his countrey to another Citie, there were straigth at hand trumpeters to welcome him, and to delight his eares with musicke, hoping thereby to fill their purses with money. He sent them woord, it was now no time to play bycause his hart was heauy for the death of his mother: the Trumpeters deceyued of their purpose, departed sorowing. Then a friende of his hearing of his sorowe, came to see and comforte him, and asked him, how long it was since his mother died? Forty yeares (quod he) then his friende vnderstanding the wilie deceyt of the Ambassadoure, laughed exceedingly. This Fable belongeth to couetous men, which studie all the wayes to the wood to saue their money. As a couetous man lay a dying, and vnderstood that at length he shoulde cary nothing with him, he turned him to his friendes and neyghboures whome he sawe present, and sayd: Learne of mee, whiche al my life time haue endeuoured to gather goods, that ye trauaill not too much too heape vp riches: for of so many Acres of land, of so much precious apparell whiche with so great sweating I haue gotte, I shall haue but a hole of fiue foot, and one sheet, wherwith being dead, I shall be couered. It is a foolishe and miserable thing to bestowe so much labor in gathering of goods, whiche (whyther we will or not) we must quickly leaue. Two Rauens feeding on a carcase, had torne away two great gobbets of flesh, which thei purposed to cary through the Aire: but Dogs comming sodenly vpon them, the one of them leauing hys piece of the carcase, straight flewe farre away from the sight of them: The other greedie of his praye, and staying to let goe his piece, was taken by the dogs: Who seeing that he should presently die, sayde: Ah wretche and vnhappie packe that I am, whiche for so small a commoditie leese so many pleasures of life. Insaciable greedinesse hath commonly bene the vndooing of couetous men. A Gote being hungrie, desired to enter a Gardin where he sawe greene potherbes: but a Bandog, whom the Gardiner had set to be keeper, would not giue him leaue, but swore his death if he stepped in. The Gote aunswered, why doest thou forbid me to eate that, whiche auayleth thee nothing? I wil in no wise do this (quod the Dog) bycause it is my naturall disposition. This Fable sheweth the nature of couetous men which haue plenty of many things, whereof they haue no vse, neyther suffer others to enioy it. A couetous man had gathered many Apples and faire, suche as the Poets report to haue bin in the Gardins of Alcinous and the Hesperians: whiche he did so spare, that he durst eate none, excepte they began to perishe. His sonne being very liberall, brought his fellowes very often into the Apple loftes, saying: Take of these what ye will, but touch not them that are perished, for my father wil haue them serued alwayes after meate, which thing they willingly obeyed. Nothing is more miserable than a couetous man whiche keepeth for others that whiche God hath lent him to vse. A certe Iester came in the calends of Ianuarie to a Bishop, who was very rich, but couetous: Of whom he begged a piece of gold for a new yeares gift. This Prelate sayd that he was mad, in that he supposed to haue so muche money giuen him for a newe yeeres gifte. Then the fellow begged a piece of siluer, but he sayd that was too much. Agayn, he required of him ye least coyne of brasse: but whe he could not obtayn yt, he sayd: I pray thee yet (reuerend father) at the least, bestow thy blissing on me in steade of a present. Then sayde the Bishop: Kneele downe sonne that I may blisse thee. Nay, then (quod hee) I care not for your blissing, if it be so good cheape, for if it had be worth a farthing, you would not haue graunted it to mee. This is against Bishops and Priests, whiche sette more by riches than all holy misteries of the Church. A countrey Prieste dwelling in Tuscia , who was very riche, had a litle Dogge whom he dearely loued: whiche, when it died, he buried in the churchyard. Whereof the Bishop of that Diocesse being aduertised, and being couetous, supposing thereby to get some great sum of money, therevppon he somoned the Priest to appeare before him. He knowing well the pretence of the Bishoppe, tooke with him fifty pieces of golde, and came to the Bishop, who layde sore to his charge the burying of his Dogge, for which he commaunded hym to prison. The Prieste (as he was riche) so beyng witty withall, humbly aunswered him, saying: Reuerend Father, if your holynesse vnderstoode the singuler wisdome of my Dogge, ye woulde nothing maruell that he was buried amongst men: For his wit passed mans reason, as well in his life time as at the houre of hys death. What is this (quod the Bishop) that thou sayest? Forsothe (quod the Priest) he made a Wil at his latter end, and knowing your necessitie, he bequethed you fifty pieces of golde, whiche I haue brought with mee. The Bishoppe, when he had receyued the money (being well pleased) sent away the Prieste vnpunished. A Shepherd whiche had a great flocke of Gotes and sheepe, seeing his flocke dayly to be a praie to the wolf, and to decrease, he gathered them all togyther,  & wt long talke exhorted them not to feare the wolfe (seeing they were moe in number, and besides that fenced with hornes, which ye wolf lacked) but that they would at once withall their might defede theselues fro his assault, promising the his own ayde to the vttermost. They being herewith encouraged, did promis and sweare that they would not stir an ynche for the wolf. But shortly after when they heard that the wolf came, they were so afrayd, that the shepherds wordes coulde by no meanes stay them from running away. Then sayde the Shepherd to him selfe: it is not possible that nature sholde be altered. Dull heads and cowards are afraid, not only of the sight, but also of the report of their enimies, neyther ca they be encouraged to manhood by any talke of their Captayne. There were fiue Fishes, yong, fat, and lustie, whiche swam in a creeke of the sea, whom a Fisher espying that passed by, set his nets to take them. They seeing that, sayde: It is good that we strongly swimme togither and breake those nets, that hereafter they may deceyue no more fishe, for we are strong, and this we may stoutely do. Then an auncient and witty Sturgion lying at reste in the water, and hearing this, started vp saying: litle ones, your intent is foolishe, therefore I counsell you, if ye will be safe, to auoyde the nets, otherwise when ye are faste in them ye will be sory. These Fishes being yong, and trusting in their owne strength, despised the counsell of the elder, and they swamme togither ouer the nets, minding to breake them, but the nets yelded, and their rushing did not preuayle, so that, when they were taken, they mourned, lamented and syghed to late. It is good to beleeue our elders, which are wiser than ourselues. Sometime the most part of birds went to the Owle and desired hir no longer to abide in holes of houses, but rather in the boughs of trees where is sweeter singing. And incontinently they shewed hir a yong Oke newe sprong vp, small and tender, where she might sitte very softly, and builde hir nest: she woulde not agree therto, but gaue them counsell not to credite the yong plante, for it woulde beare in tyme to come, birdlyme, whiche would be their destruction. They being a light kinde of birdes and often flitting, despised the good cousel of the Owle: but when the Oke was growe, it was brode and full of boughes: then the birdes togither did flie amongst the boughs, there they tooke their pleasure, hopped vp and downe, played and song togither. In the meane time the Oke brought forth birdlime. Then the smal birds all too late repented, that they refused that holsome counsell: and this is the cause (men say) why all birdes, as soone as they see the Owle, come clustering about hir, follow hir, sit aboute hir and flie with hir, for they remembring that counsell, accounte hir wise, and come aboute hir by flockes, that they might learne wisdome and knowledge of hir. Despise not the counsel of him that giueth it a right. A Foxe being caught in a snare, when she had escaped with hir tayle cut of, was ashamed of hir life, where vppon she pretended to persuade other Foxes therto, so as by a comon mischiefe she myght couer hir owne shame: When shee had assembled them all togither, she couselled them to cutte off their tayles, alledging that they were not onely vncomely but also a superfluous burthen: One of the Foxes aunswered hir: Truely sister, yf this thing were not only for thy profite, thou wouldst not counsell vs thertoo. Wicked men gyue counsell too their neighbours for no good will, but for their owne aduantage. A Lyon by chaunce espyed a Gote vpo an high rock, whom he counselled rather to come downe and feed in the greene medow: so wold I sayde the gote, if thou were thence, for thou geuest me counsell, not for my pleasure, but to slake thy hunger. Credit not euery mans talke, for some counsel not to profit thee, but themselues. A Foxe being taken by a Countryman of whose Hens he had kylled many, with flattering woords besought hym to set him at libertie, swearyng deuoutely that thencefoorth he would neuer do him harme. The Countryman aunswered, I woulde willingly forgiue thee, and let thee go safe and sounde, but that I know thee to be craftie, and a promise breaker, and I certenly know, that thou canst not hinder mee beeing deade, but I mystrust thee being alyue. We must giue no credit to false and craftie men. A certeyne chaste Matrone that loued hir husbande well, was grieued at the heart for the sickenesse of hym, weeping and mournyng much:  & bycause hir hearty good will might appeere the more, shee besought death, if needes he woulde haue hir Husbande, rather too take hir and to excuse him: whiles she thus spake, she espied Death with his lothesome lookes approching, wherewith she beyng agast, and already repenting, sayd: I am not that body which thou seekest, he lyeth in the bed whom thou camest to slea. No man loueth hys friende so well, but he loueth hym selfe better: Neere is my coate, but neerer is my skinne. There was a Lion which in his youth through his fiercenesse had purchased the displeasure of many: whereof in hys olde age hee receyued iust punishement. Euery beast in recompence of their hurt requited hys quarell: The Bore wyth his tuske, the Bull strake him with hys horns, and especialy the Asse, (beeing inflamed to cast off the name of a cowarde) with chyding and kickyng, couragiously didde beate him. The Lion then wayling lamentably sayde: Those whome sometime I haue hurt, pay me agein with the same measure, and not without a cause: Agein, those to whome sometyme I haue done good, requite not now my goodnesse, but rather vniustly are my foes: greate was my follie when I made so many my enimies, but greter, in that I trusted false friendes. When thou art in prosperous estate be not lofty nor fierce, if fortune once frown or looke awry, they whom thou haste hurte, shall reuenge theyr quarell: if thou haue freends, put a differece betwene them, some are frends not too thee, but too thy table, and to thy fortune, which as the wynde turneth, will turne, and happye shalte thou be if they be not thy foes. Somtime an Egle buylt hir nest in an high tree, who by chaunce espyed yong Rabbettes a farre off feeding, whiche he snatched vp, and caried to his yong ones to feede on. The Conye with flatteryng woords besoughte him to restore his son. But the Egle supposing him being but a small beaste, and earthly, by no meanes able to hurt him, tore the in peeces with hir clawes in the sight of the Conie, and gaue the to hir yong ones to make merie withall. The Conies heart earning sore at the death of hir Rabbets, woulde not let it rest vnreuenged, but digged vp by the rootes that tree where hir nest was, which with the least blast of winde was ouerthrowne: By which meanes the Egles yong ones being without feathers, and not able to flie, fell to the grounde, and were destroyed. Which thing not a little comforted the Conie. No man bearing him selfe stiff of his owne strength, ought to despise the weaker, seing sometyme the feeble do reuenge the wrong don to them by the mightie. It hapned that Hares hering a strange roaring in the woode, all trembling began swiftly to runne away: In running they stayed at a marishe, being in doute what to doe, seeing danger on euery syde: and to encrease theyr feare they espied Frogs there drowned. Then one wyser than the rest sayd: Wherfore are we so fondly afraid? Let vs take a good hart, for swiftnesse in runing we lack not, but only a couragious stomack, as for this hurly burly we need not fear but set it light. In all things take a good hart: strength without courage is but dead: for the cheefe heade of strength is hardinesse. The Bee whych as men think, was the firste maker of Waxe, came sometyme to sacrifice to the Gods, whose oblatio to Iupiter was a house of hony, wherwith Iupiter reioycing, commaunded hir petition whatsoeuer it were, to be grauted. Then the Bee asked thus: most puisant god of al gods, I besech thee graut to thy handmayde, that who soeuer cometh to the hyue to steale away hir hony, may forthwith dye as I haue pricked him. Iupiter being abashed at hir requeste, bycause he loued mankinde farre aboue all other, at lengthe sayde to hir: Be thou contente if thou sting hym that stealeth thy honye, that thou mayst leese thy sting and foorthwyth dye, and that in thy sting thy lyfe may lye. We curse oure enemyes, but it commonly lyghteth on oure owne heads. A harte escaping Hunters, entred a caue, where he chaunced on a Lyon, by whome he was taken: As he was dying, he sayde: Woe is mee, that fleeing from men, haue happened on the cruellest of all beasts. Many men auoyding smal dangers, runne into great. A great route of Towne dogs coursed sore a Country dog which ran away and durst not resist: at the last he turned ageyne and shewed his teethe to them, then they all stoode still, and durste not come neere him, where as the Capteine generall of the hoste was presente, who turned to his souldiers, & sayd: Felowes, this sighte warneth vs not to flee, seeing we see more daunger to them that runne away, than to those that resist. Two Pots stoode togither on a bank, the one was of earth, the other of brasse, which both were sodeinly caught by the force of the streames, the earthen Pot fering to be broken went swiftliest, whom the Brasen potte comforted, willing him to feare nothyng: for he coulde take heede ynough, that they shoulde not knocke togither. Nay (said the other) I knowe well inough, whether the Riuer beate thee agaynst mee, or mee againste thee; I shall be in hazarde on euery side. Therfore haue I determined to keepe no companie with thee. Better it is too deale with thy fellowe, than with thy better, for the myghtyer man can sooner hurte thee, than thou him. A Swan being nere at the poynt of death, was asked of the Storke, why he soong sweter, being nigh his death, (which all other beasts do so much hate) than in all his lyfe tyme before, seing at that tyme he ought to be sory: the Swan aunswered: Bicause from hencefoorth I shall not bee troubled with seekyng for meate, neither shall I neede to feare the Foulers ginne. Wee are warned hereby not to feare death, being by that bereft from all miseries. A man of very old age, was mocked of a yong man, bicause he planted trees, wherof he shold neuer see fruite: The old man aunswered: Neyther thou perhaps shalte gather fruite of those whiche thou gost about to set. Shortly after the yong man fell out of a tree, whiche he clymbed to gather beries, and brake his necke. Death spareth no age. The birds somtime being at debate about a certen election, at length chose the Phesant and the Pecocke, who also straue for their prerogatiue, and about it consumed their substance. Then ye birdes assembled before the Egle, to whom they shewed their election, crauing that hee as an indifferent Iudge would confirme it. The Egle, bicause he would perfectly vnderstand the case, sent for them both to heare them. The Phesaunt beganne his tale thus: O ryghtuous iudge howe passing faire a birde I am thou mayest perceyue, howe sweete also my flesh is, it is not vnknowne, wherefore I thinke my selfe worthy of the Lordshippe. Then the Pecocke layde for hym selfe thus: Moste gracious Lady, the woordes whiche the Phesaunt hath alleaged are vntrue, for in beautie I farre exceede him, besydes that my varyable tayle of ryght chalengeth this honor,  & forthwith she spred out hir tayle: When the Egle had heard both their argumentes, hee began first with the Pecocke, and sayd: In setting vp thy tayle thou haste dispraysed thy selfe, for thy filthy feete declare thee vnworthy to bee ruler: Then turning to the Phesant he sayde: bycause thou art weake and alwayes weeping, and further canste not sing, I depriue thee also of this office. And so both were put out. They which wil be lords must not striue. The Ape came to a Brocke to borowe an Hundreth markes, bycause hee woulde occupie beyonde the Sea, promysing him halfe the gayne: the Brocke aunswered, I am content, if thou canste fynd sufficient sureties for payment, with an Oblygatyon of theyr handes. The Ape broughte the Bugle and the Bull to bee his suretyes, and left the obligation in the custodie of the Horse, and went on his iourney, but neuer returned. The Brocke seeing hym selfe thus deluded by the Ape, did demaunde the dette of the sureties, but they scorned hym, wherefore hee complayned vnto the Iudge, and shewed the obligation, who compelled the sureties to paye it, but they euer after persecuted the Brocke, and wounded him sore. He that boroweth not, keepeth hym selfe oute of stryfe and greate trouble. The Dog  & the Cock entred friendship & iorneyd togither: when night drew neere, the Cocke flew vp into a tree, and rested, but the dog slept at the roote of the hollow tree. It hapned that the Cocke, as he was wot, crowed in the night season, whome the Fox hearing, ranne towarde him, and as he stoode on the grounde, he prayed the Cock to come downe, bicause he greately desired to embrace so trim a singing birde: the Cocke bade him that he shoulde first wake the porter, whiche slept at the root of the tree, and that when he had opened he woulde come downe: as the Foxe sought meanes too call hym vp, the Dog starte vp and tore him in pieces. Wyse men wil by pollicy send their enimies to myghtier than themselues. A Foxe sometyme bad a Storke to supper, when the seruice was broughte in, the Foxe set broth on the table, which bycause it was thyn, the Storke assayed to picke vp with his bill, but coulde not, whiche the Foxe easily licked vp: the other thus deluded, departed with muche shame. Within few days after ye Stork returned and likewise bade the Fox too supper: A glasse full of meate was set on the boorde, which bycause it had a narow necke, the Foxe might well looke on and be hungry, but he coulde not once licke his lips withall, which the Storke with his bill easely pulled out. Laughing, iesting, craftie and deceytfull dealing muste be requited with the like. A certaine religious man of the order of S. Anthonie, begged of a Husbandman a portion of corne, for which he promised to warrant all that he had, especially that his Sheepe that yere should bee safe. The coutryman giuing credit to his promises, lette his Sheepe stray abroade where they list, wherof the gretest number a Wolf destroyed: the Farmer therwith chafing, when the nexte yeare the gatherer came for corne, did not only denie him his almes, but also blamed him for his foolishe promises. Why what is the matter (quod hee)? The other aunswered, his sheepe were destroyed by the Wolfe: What the Wolf? (said he) surely that is a naughtie beast, trust him not, but beware of him: for he would not only deceiue S. Anthony but also Chryst him selfe, if hee could. It is therfore follie to credit those whose marke that they shoote at is onely to deceyue. A Parat being brought out of the East partes into the West, where no such birds are wont to breede, maruelled that he was more esteemed there, than in his natiue countrey: for hee was kepte in a Cage of yuorie wrought wyth Syluer wire, fed with most sweete meate, which thyng happened not to other birdes of the west partes, whiche in beautie and speaking as farre excelled. Then the Turtle beeing shutte vp in the same cage, sayde: This is not maruel woorthy, for no man in his owne countrey is rewarded as hee deserueth. Sometyme an Asse serued a Gardiner of whose crueltie he complayned to Iupiter beseching him to haue a new maister. Iupiter graunted his request,  & put him to a tyler, who bicause he laded hym with much heuier burdens, he mislyked: He therefore prayed Iupiter yet once ageyne, to shift hys seruice from hym to a gentler Mayster. The God smyled at hys follie, yet the Asse continued so long an earnest suter, that he forced him therto. The he serued a Curryer, whose trade when the Asse had well perceiued, he repented, saying: Ah wretche that I am, which can be contented with no maister, for now I haue got suche a one, which as I suppose, will also currie my skin. Things presente we neuer allow, but seeke for new. The Wax lamented that he was made soft,  & in danger to be hurt with euery light stroke. On a time he espied ye tyles were made of earthe, muche softer than hee was, who by the heate of the fire were made so harde, that they continued many yeeres, he likewise cast himself into the fire, hoping therby to come to that perfection of hardnesse that they were: but the Waxe streight way beeing melted, consumed away. We are forbidde to couet that which is contrary to our nature. A Physitian tooke vppon him to cure a Pacient, who at length dyed: then sayd he to the Pacientes kinsfolke: this man caste hym selfe awaye for lacke of good dyet. Hee that vseth quaffing and lyueth inordinatly, shall neuer be olde, or else shall haue a very shorte lyfe. An Asse caryed an Image of siluer on his shoulders, whiche euery one that met it, did worship: wherwith beeing insolent, he woulde no longer be an Asse: then was it tolde hym that hee was no God, but caried an Idoll. They that are placed in dignity ought to know that they are men. A Fisher fished in a certe ryuer, where he spread abroade hys nets and compassed in the water, tying a stone to eyther of his ropes, and thus continued beating the water that the Fishes shooting by, might vnawares fall into his nets: which one of the inhabitauntes thereabout seeing, rebuked him for troubling ye riuer, that he suffered it not to haue the cleere water: he aunswered: Excepte the riuer be thus troubled, I shoulde dye for hunger. The Rulers of Cities doo most of all enriche them selues, when they stirre vp discord amongst the people. The members of man perceyuing the Belly would not worke, fell at variaunce with him and denied their helpe any longer. It happened, that they began to faynt, the cause whereof they perceyued to bee: that the Belly, hauing receyued ye meate, did equally parte it to euery member, whervpon they became friends agayne. Great things by discorde decaye, but small things by concorde are of force. A Frogge seeing a Crab swimming by the water side, sayd: What is he so ylfauoured and foule, that dare trouble my water? seeing I am mightie and strong, I will put him to flight. When he had so sayd, he lept vpon the Crab saying: why wast not thou ashamed O wretch, to enter into my resting place? Didst not thou blush being so foule and so black, to defile the cleare water? The Crab, as his maner is, began to go backe and sayde: I pray thee sister say not so, for I would be at one with thee, therfore come not thus vpon mee. The Frog seeing him go back, supposed that he did it for feare of him, whereby he waxed more fierse against him, saying: Drawe not back thou filth, for thou maist not escape, this day will I giue thy flesh to the fish, and incontinent he skipped vpo him to kill him. The Crab seeing the present daunger turned about, and with his clawes byt the Frog & tore him in pieces. Euery man, as much as in him lieth, let him studie to auoyde warre and discord. The Leopard sometime fought with ye Dragon, against whome (bycause he could not preuayle) he besought the Unicorne to ayde him, and sayd: Thou art a goodly beast, expert in fighting & valiaut, wherfore I pray thee helpe me. The Unicorne hearing this commendatio of himself, aunswered: Thou sayst truthe, for I haue skill in fighting, and therfore I wil valiauntly defende thee, for when yt Dragon shall open his mouthe, I will thrust him into the throte with my horne. Whe they were both come to the Dragon, the Leopard gaue the onset, trusting to the strength of the Unicorne, but the Drago fought with them & spit fire at them. The Unicorne seeing him open his mouth ran hastely to thrust him through, but he cast his head at one side, whereby ye Unicorne missing him, smot his horne fast into the ground and died. Hee that wil fight for another, seeketh his owne destruction. A Dogge lay sleeping in a racke full of hey, thyther came an Oxe to feede. The Dog seeing him comming, barked  & forbad him. To whom the Oxe sayd: the Diuell choke thee with this thy despite, which neyther canst eate hey thy self, nor yet will suffer me. Many are of that disposition, yt they will grudge others that, whiche they for lacke of wit can not attayne vnto. A certen yong Man espied an old man going crooked like a bent bow, whom he asked if he would sell a bowe? Haste thou (quod hee) any neede to loose thy money? If thou liue til my age, nature shal giue thee a bowe without money. The faultes of age are not to be laughed at, bicause no man, if he liue, can escape it. A certein gluttonous man tooke hys iourney to go to a Wedding wherevnto he was bidde. By the way he found an heape of peares, but none of them he touched, albeit he was exceeding hungry, which in cotempt he made water on, for he thought scorne of such meate, going to so good cheare. But as he passed on his way, he came to a streame lately risen with rayne, whiche without daunger of his life he could not passe ouer, therefore he returned home againe: and by the way he was so hungry (bicause of his log fasting) that if he had not eate the peares that he pissed on, seeing there was nothing else, he had famished. Despise nothing, for what is so vile or base, that will not at one time or another serue for some purpose? A certen rich German fell sick, to who came many Phisitians to cure him, (for to hony come flies by heapes) amogst whome one helde opinion that he must take a Clyster, if he woulde recouer hys health: The pacient hearing this (bicause hee had neuer taken any such medicine) was wood angrie, and commaunded all ye Phisitians to be put out of doores, saying that they were mad, whiche would minister to his tayle, when his head aked. All holsome things seeme tedious to them which neuer assayed the. A certein poore man being sick, vowed to the Gods, if he might recouer hys health, an hundred Oxen in sacrifice: the Gods (bicause they would trie him) made him whole. When he was well, bicause he had no Oxen, he made an hundred Oxe of paste, which on the Altar he sacrifised. The Gods meaning to punish him therfore, appeared to him in a dreame,  & sayd: Go to the sea shore in such a place & there thou shalt find an hudred talents of gold. This fellow when he awaked, reioysing greatly, went to the place yt was shewed him and sought for it, where he was take by Pirates, whome he prayed for his liberty, promising the a M. talents of gold, but to him they gaue no credit, but caried him away and solde him for a M. Grotes. God hateth dissemblers & lyers. A Cat hearing that there were many Mise in a certein house, came thither: of which, those that she caught she deuoured: The Mise seeing them selues dayly diminished, agreed togither to come down no more, least they should al be destroied: for if the Cat come not hither (sayd they) we shall be safe. The Cat perceyuing the Mise descended not, thought by deceyt to take them, and climbed vp on a beame, wheron she hanged hir self, fayning to be dead, whom one of the Mise, as he looked downward espied, and sayd to him: verily my friende, though I knewe thou were dead, yet would I not come downe. A wise man once deceyued through the falshood of a wicked man, will neuer after credite hys dissimulation. A Wolfe being bitten by Dogs and euill entreated, laye prostrate along: he lacking meate, espied a sheep, whome he desired to bring him some of the running water to drink, saying: If thou wilt giue me drink, I will prouide meate my self she aunswered: if I giue thee drink, thou wilt eate mee. This Fable is against an euil body, whiche by dissimulation lyeth in wayte. The report was, that the Asse lay sick, nigh at the point of death, there came both the Wolues and Dogges to visite him, and demaunded of his Sonne, howe his Father dyd, he aunswered (looking through the chinkes of the doore) better than ye would. This Fable speaketh of them, that fayne to take heauily the death of other, where as they wishe them dead long before. A Foxe came into a Uineyarde where he espyed faire clusters of Grapes which were ripe, of them fayne would he eate, and bicause they were past his reach, he thought to find some shift to gette them: but perceyuing his labor to be lost, and that by no meanes he could satisfie his desire, he turned his sorowe into ioye, saying: Those Clusters be yet to soure to eate, for they would set my teeth on edge. It is wisdome to dissemble that he careth not for that whiche he knoweth he can not get. It was a custome in a certeyn Citie of Picene in Italie , that he whiche killed a Hog in Winter should bid his neighbours to supper. Now there was one which minded to kill a Hog, but lothe he was to be at any charges, wherevppon he asked the aduise of his Godfather, how he might shifte of the expences. Tell abroade (quod hee) to morow, that this night there was a Hog stollen from thee. It happened the same night, (he nothing mistrusting it) that one verily conueyed a Hogge from him. In the morning whe he rose, he looked for his hogs, wherof missing one, he went incotinent to his Godfather, and cried a loude, that one of his Hogs were stolle. Wel done (quod hee) thou playest ye wise fellow, for so I taught thee to speake: the other swore by all the Gods he did not lie. I conne thee thak (sayd his Godfather) thou followest wel my cousell. The other for all that did sweare and stare the more that it was true. Thou arte to be comended (quod hee) for I forwarned thee so to saye, and my counsell was good. The other seing him selfe thus flouted, departed heauily. The Eagle called togither all manner of wildfoule: which being assembled, as he corrected certein faultes, there came Hunters which set abroade their nets to catche the birds. The Egle seing the present dauger, made proclamation by his criers, that all should follow the banner of the Egle,  & flie with hir, if they would escape: then as many as flew with hir escaped, but some gluttonous & disobediet, who beholding the pray & coueting it, flew into ye nets, wherin being entangled, they cried piteously. Hee that will not obey, falleth into mischief. A Satyr , which in old time was counted God of the Woods, walking abroade, found a wayfaring ma couered with snow  & nigh dead with cold: on whom taking pitie, he brought him into his denne & made a fire & cherished him. It happened that the Satir espied him breathing on his hands, wherof demauding the cause, he answered: to heate his hands. And being set downe to meate, the trauayler blowed on fried barley that was on his trencher. He asked againe, why he did so? to coole it (quod he.) The the Satir draue him out of his denne, & told him that he would harbor none that had so variable a mouth. Deale not with that man, which hath a double hart, or is vnstable in hys wordes. The Griffon sometime tooke vppon him the gouernement of a Realme, whiche with Tyrannie he ruled, commaunding that no Straunger should bye or sell any thing amongst them. Secondly, that none shoulde come from other Countreys to them. Thirdly, that none of hys subiectes. should trauell to other places: These three things being straightly executed, he liued in pleasure and waxed riche, whereof he neuer gaue any thing. It happened that his Countrey was destroyed by lightning and tempestes, wherefore hys Citizens cried out, that they might trauaile abroade, least they died for hunger. Then he sent Ambassadoures to other Nations, desiring to sell them of their marchadise and barter them at their pleasure. But they denied it, bycause he neuer would sell any thing to the: then he required that they woulde come with their ware to him, but they woulde not. Last of all he prayed them to receyue him and his people being then in miserie: but they sayd: Thou wouldest neuer come till neede made thee, therefore we will not receyue thee. Then hee and his people being thus reprobate, died miserably. We must doo, as we woulde be done vnto. A Pie espying a Cuckow lurking amogst the boughes of a tree, supposed it to be a Hauke, wherwith being moued, flewe away: which thing other birdes neere at had beholding, mocked the Pie, that in stead of a Hauke, she flew fro the Cuckow, she answered: I had rather be mocked of you, tha my friends should weepe for mee. It is better to minister occasion for our foes to laugh at, than our friends to weepe at. A Serpent being troden vpon by many, made his moane to Iupiter , but he sayd to him: If thou hadst stinged him whiche first kicked thee, the next would neuer haue attempted it. They which withstande their assaulters, become a terror to others. A certein man caried about through the whole worlde a paire of bootes, whiche he woulde giue that man who feared not his wife. He could find none a great while, which would take them. But at length a Countreyman receyued them, to whome he sayde: Soft lette me put them in thy bosome and wype them. But the Coutryman (bycause his shirt was new  & white) sayd: I dare not least my wife taut me for blacking my shirt: the he tooke away the bootes & bet him therwith, saying: Get thee hence in the Diuels name, bicause thou dreadest thy wife for a litle trifle, thou didst meane to deceyue me of my bootes, and he straight way departed. But I think he hath not yet bestowed them iustly of any man. A certen Woman had a dronkard to hir husband, from whiche vice (bicause she would rid him) she vsed this pollicie: She watched him when he was dronken heauy a sleepe,  & like a dead man without feeling, and tooke him on hir shoulders, caried him into the churchyard, layde him in a graue & departed. When she supposed that he was sober, she went and knocked at the head of the tombe, who asked, who knocketh at the doore: his wife aunswered, I am here, and haue brought meate for the dead. Ah (quod hee) bring mee rather some drink tha meat, thou doest trouble me in speaking of meate and no drinke. The good woman stroke hir breast and sayd; woe is mee wretch, for my craft will do no good: thou my husband art nothing mended, but become worse, so that this disease hath got an habit in thee. We must not continue in euill deeds, for custome sometime creepeth on a man. There was a Bore which routed vp the corne, whose eare a Countreyman cut off. It chaunced he came againe the second time, then he cut off his other eare. When he came yet againe, he caught him  & caried him into the citie and gaue it his Attorney to make mery withall. At the feaste when he was broken vp, his hart was not found. Then his Maister was wrothe with the Cooke therfore. Sir (quod the Countryma) it is no maruell yt his hart is not here, for I think the foolish Bore had no harte, for if he had had any, he would not haue come so oft into my corne to his cost. Then all the guestes laughed exceedingly at his foolishnesse. Many liue so without spirite or boldnesse, that it is doubtfull whether they haue a harte or not. A Gnat in the Winterseason, supposing that he should die for hunger and cold, came to a Hyue of bees, of whom he desired meate  & lodging, promising (if they would graunt it him) to teache their children the arte of Musicke. Then one of the Bees aunswered: I had rather my children learned some trade whiche can keepe them from hunger and colde. We are warned to bring vp our children in those sciences, whereby they may be able to get their liuing. A certein man, when the Owner was absent, came to the place where hony was made, and stole away an hony combe: the owner at his returne seeing the hiues emptie, stode vp and sought if ought were left. The Bees returning from feeding, and fynding him there, pricked him with their stings, and handeled him very yll. Then he sayde to them: O vile beastes, whiche haue lette eskape vnhurt him whiche hath stollen your honycombes, and strike me which take care ouer you. Some men through follie cannot beware of their enimies, and driue back their friends, as such that lay awayte to deceyue. Many creeping beastes sat a sunning, amogst whom the cockatrice was, who cryed aloude: Who so dare fight with mee, let him come foorth. The Snayle cam forth to fyght with hir: as they were togyther striuyng, ye Cockatrice would haue bit the Snaile, and poysoned him, but he drew his hed into his shell that she coulde not touch him, afterward the Snayle came forth and bit the serpent, wherby she was ouercome. Not long after, she being agein encoraged, excused hir self, that she was not valiantly ouerthrowne: wherfore she sayd: If there were any other warrior amongst the, shee would reuenge hir self, and make him run away. The Hedgehog hearing this came foorth, who was full of prickles, whom the Serpent assaulted, but the Hedgehog pricked hir sore, and wounded hir, wherof she was ashamed: but a Frog willing to be reuenged of the Serpente, wente on hir, and would haue slayn hir, but she though wearie hardned hir heart, and tooke the Frog and deuoured him. Hee is a foole which being vnarmed, will assault his enimie. The Kings fisher is a solitarie birde, always liuyng in the sea, whiche as it is sayd, taketh heede of mens huntings, & therfore buildeth hir nest vpon the rocks in the sea, who on a tyme being redie to breed, did make hir nest: As she was gone out to hir pastyme, it chaunced the sea to arise (being stirred wyth a boysterous wynde) aboue hir nest, whiche being drowned, hir yong ones perished. Shee at hir returne, seyng what hadde happened, sayde: Wo is mee wretche, whiche fearing to be betrayed on lands, haue runne to this which is more deceiptfull. Some men taking heede of their foes, doo vnwyttyngly happen vppon friendes who are muche crueller than theyr enimies. In the lande of the Moores there is great store of Apes, whose enimie by kynde is the Lybarde, whome bycause hee can not match with strong arme (seing they clymb into high trees) hee practiseth this pollicie against them: he layeth himself along vnder the boughs, and stretching out his legs faineth himselfe deade. At whiche sight the Apes that sit in the trees, doo much reioyce, then they supposing hym to be deade, sende out a scoute watch to descrie the truth: The Ape commeth tripping warely and softely, who perceiuing no toke of life, bicause the Libard in al pointes counterfeteth a deade carkas, boldely ventureth to go vpon him: the other Apes seeing his boldnesse, al feare sette aparte, come downe, and leape vpon him, which he quietly endureth: at length when they haue in contempte kicked him so long that they are nigh wearie: he starteth vp sodeynly, and one with his teeth, an other with his nayles, he teareth in peeces and deuoureth. Wee ought chiefly to eschue that enimie, whiche fayneth his strength to fayle. A Fox entred into a poultrie house, wher he saw a Henne on hir nest being sicke, whom he asked, how she did: Ah (quod the Hen) I should do much better (sister) were thou gone. The presence of our enimies doth much hurte vs. Two men hating one an other deadly, sayled together in one ship, wherof the one satte in the foreparte of the ship, the other in the hinder parte thereof, sodeinely there arose a tempest, which put the ship in hazarde: then he that set in the sterne, asked the master which part of the shyp shold first be drowned, the sterne (quod he:) then he sayd: My death shal nothing greeue me if I may see myne enimie die before mee. Many men care not what harme they haue, so that they may see theyr enimies before them hurte. The Crowe enuied the Rauen bycause by him men tooke diuination, for which he was supposed to forshew things to com: wherupon he espying trauailers by, flewe vp into a tree, where shee stoode and cryed lyke a Rauen: They at hir crying turning asyde and wondring, at the last vnderstanding the truth, one of them sayde: Let vs be going fellows, it was the Crow that cried, and she hath no soothsaying. Those men whiche striue with their betters, besides that they are neuer able too matche them, deserue to bee laughed at. The Wolfe hauyng muche prouisyon of meate, liued at ease, to whome the Foxe came and demaunded the cause of his ease: the Wolfe perceiuing that he enuied his good fare, fayned sickenesse too bee the cause thereof, and hee prayed the Foxe, too beseech the Gods for his health: The Foxe being grieued that his purpose woulde not prosper, went to a Shepeherd, and willed him to go to the Wolues denne, where sodeinly he might take his enimie that liued voyde of care: the shepeherde assaulted the Wolfe, and slue him, the Fox possessed his denne with al the good chere, but he enioyed it no long time, for the same Shepeherde caught him likewise. Enuie is a lothesome thing, and hee that is the cause thereof commonly maketh a rod for his owne tayle. Two men made their prayer to Iupiter , a Couetous man and an enuious, who sent Apollo to them to satisfy their desires, he gaue them free libertie to desire vppon this condition, that whatsoeuer the one required, the other shuld receiue double. The couetous man was long in doute, bycause he thought nothing was ynough: at length he asked no small thyng, hys companyon receyued double so muche. The Enuious man requested one of his owne eyes to be put out, greately reioycing that his fellow shoulde lose bothe. Couetousnesse neuer sayth ho: as for Enuie nothing is more mad, which wisheth him selfe mischief to hurte another withall. The Wolfe and the Asse were sawyers togither, but the Asse wrought aboue, and the Wolfe beneath, who sought occasion to slea his fellowe, wherfore he sayd: Ah wretched Asse, why doest thou cast dust into myne eyes? Forsooth (quod he) I doo not, but rule it after my knowledge: if it please thee to sawe aboue, I will beneath. Tushe (quod the Wolfe) I see what thou dost, if thou cast any more into my eyes I will plucke oute thine: when he had thus saide, the Wolfe blew harde, that the dust might flie vp in to his felows eyes, but the timber staying it, it fell into his owne: wherewith beeing sore troubled, he sware, that he would ouerthrow the porters, but sodeinly it fell, and killed the Wolfe. Mischief commonly lighteth vpon the pate of the Author. The Lyon beeing stricken in age fell sicke, and laye in his denne, all beastes saue onely the Foxe came to visite theyr Kyng: Wherevppon the Wolfe hauyng oportunitie, accused the Foxe vnto the Lyon, as one that sette naught by hym beeing theyr Lorde, for whiche cause hee came not to see him: By chaunce the Foxe came in, and hearde the latter ende of the Wolues tale. Then the Lyon roared ageynste the Foxe, who incontinent crauyng space too make aunswere, sayde: which of all those that are here present, hath done so muche good as I, which haue trauayled farre and neere to seeke a remedie for thee of the physition, which I haue lerned: Then the Lion commaunding him foorthwith to tel the medicine, he sayde: The Wolues skin being yet alyue, to be plucked from his backe and put warme about thee, is the medicine and onely remedy. As the wolfe lay along, the Fox laughed at him, saying: It becommeth not thee to prouoke thy lord to wrath, but to fauour and good will. Hee whiche continually diggeth pits, at length turneth him selfe therein. A Harte being pursued of a Hunter, ran into an Oxe stall, praying the Oxen to hide him in their rack: they tolde him that there was no safe harboring, for both their maister and his seruants woulde come thither: He answered that he was safe inough so that they woulde not bewray him: the seruat came in,  & mistrusting nothing to be hid in the hey, departed: the Hart was excedingly glad, and feared nothing. Then one of the Oxen older and wiser than the rest, sayd to him: It is an easy matter to deceiue him, that is as blinde as a Mole, but if thou escape our maister, which hath an hundred eyes, I will warrant thee: Streight after came in the maister to redresse his seruats negligence, looked rounde aboute, and groping in the rack, felt the horns of the Hart, & cryed out for his seruantes, who straight way came, tooke the beast and slue him. When one is in perill, it is harde to fynde a place to hyde him in, eyther it is that Fortune tosseth the oppressed, or that being afrayd, and vncertaine what to doe, thorough follie they betray them selues. A Cat sometyme being hungry came to deuoure a Cock, whome bycause shee had no iust cause to hurt, layd to his charge his great noise that he was wont to make, bycause that with his shrill crowing, he did let men of their rest in the night: the Cock replied that he was therof giltlesse, seeing by that meanes he raised vp men to theyr dayly trauell: It is but lost labor (sayd the Cat) to pleade thus: for thou treadest thy mother, neither art thou so content, but thou medlest with thy sister: the Cock being readie to purge him selfe of that fault, the Cat waxed more eger against him, saying: thou striuest against the streame, for this daye I will bee thy preest. If any man would beat a dogge, he shall soone fynde a staffe. The euill man by hooke or by crooke, if he list will throw thee downe. As a Countryman walked aboute his grounds, he found a Serpet in the snow nigh deade with colde, whiche hee pitying much, brought home, and layde him by the fires syde. The Serpent by reason of the fire, came again to his stregth and venim, coulde no longer endure the heate, but filled all the Cottage with his hyssing. The Countryman gotte vp a stake, and ranne at hym, wherwith he stroke him, and then tooke him vp for that displeasure, saying: Wylt thou thus recompence my curtesy? Goest thou aboute to destroy him that saued thy lyfe? It chanceth often, if a man saue a theefe from the gallowes, hee will soonest seeke his death, and on whom men bestowe moste labour, of him they shall reape least good. A certeine Husbadmans Seruat threw downe his maisters Asse hedlong from an high Rock, that hee might not dayly bee forced to driue him too and fro, but hee told his maister, that hee fell down him selfe: wherefore his maister dydde cause hym to beare all thyngs on his shoulders, which the Asse was woont before to carrie. The which thyng the euill seruaunt markyng, sayd: I was not well aduised when I slue my innocent fellow, which eased mee of so great trauaile, I am thus worthily serued. Whyles fooles would auoyde any euill, they fall into woorse. The Bat, the Bramble, and the Cormorant entred freendship togither, and determined to liue lyke merchants, whervppon the Bat borowed money, and shipped it, the Bramble toke garmentes, and the Cormorant Brasse, and sailed together. It chanced a greate storme too aryse, that the ship was drowned, and all their goods lost, and they escaped to lande: since which time the Cormorant sitteth on the sea shore, to see if the sea will caste vp the Brasse any where. The Bat fearing his creditours, sheweth not his head by day light, but goth to feede by nyght: And the Bramble doeth catche hold of the garments of such as are passers by, seekyng if hee can fynde hys owne. Wherevnto wee doo apply our selues, in tyme to come wee followe the same. The Worme that lurketh in the durte went abrode vpon lande, and said to all beasts, that shee was as learned a phisitian for medicines as euer was Poeen phisitian to the Gods: Why (quod the Foxe) canste thou cure others,  & canst not heale thy selfe of thy lamenesse? All talke is in vaine, except experience haue ben had before. Sometime a Dogge had stolne a peece of flesh from a Butcher in the market, and streight ran away: the Butcher being cold at the heart with the losse of the thing, first helde his peace: then remembryng hymselfe, cried out after him, saying: O vile theef, for this time runne safely, thou goest scotfree for thy swiftnesse, but hereafter I will watche thee narrowlier. The burnte hande feareth the fyre. A countreymans sonne rosted Cockles, whome as he heard hissing, he sayd: O O euill beasts whiche when youre housen be burnt do sing. All things done out of due order, are to be discommended. The Asse  & the Foxe being entred friendship, went forth a hunting, whom a Lion meeting the Fox seeing the present danger, went to the Lion and promised to deliuer ye Asse into his hands, so that she might scape scotfree: the Lyon agreed: then she led the asse, and caused him to be trapped in a net: but the Lion seing him so fast, that he might not escape, first layd hold on ye Foxe, and after he serued the Asse likewise. They which betray their felows vndoo them selues vnawares. A Bandog (whiche is able too vanquishe not only Wolues, but also Beares) had iornied a long way with an Asse which caryed a sacke full of bread. As they wente on their way, a tempeste arose, then the Asse hapned on a medow, where with good grasse he filled his belly full: but the Dog desired the Asse to giue him a little peece of bread least he sterued: he not onely denied him that, but also scoffingly counselled him to feede on grasse with him. In the meane tyme the Asse espying the Wolfe coming, besought the Dog to ayde him. Nay (quod he) thou didst counsel me to feede on grasse to slake my hunger, so I will thee to defend thy selfe with thy yron heeles agaynst the Wolfe. They which aide not them which neede help, are wont to be destitute of the succor of others in the time of neede. A Dog brought an action ageinst a Sheep for a lofe of bread which he ought him, the sheepe denied it, wherupon they ioyned issue, then the Dog broughte in the Kight, the Wolfe, and the Rauen to beare witnesse to the debt, who affirmed it for truth: the Sheepe was condemned, whome the Dog caughte, and pulled the skinne from his backe. It is well knowne, that by false witnesse many are oppressed and ouercome. There was an Asse amongest the Cumanes , whiche was weary of his bondage, who by chaunce brake his coller and ranne awaye into the Forrest, where hee founde a Lions skynne, whiche hee made fitte for his bodie, and thus behaued hymselfe lyke a Lyon, puttyng bothe men and beastes in feare with his tayle: For the Cumanes knewe not a Lion. In this wyse hee liued there a good while, bothe counted and dreaded for a fierse Lyon, vntyll that a certayne Straunger comming vnto that Citie, (whiche oftentymes hadde seene both a Lion and an Asse,) and therefore easy to be known, perceyued by his long hanging eares, and other euidente sygnes, that hee was an Asse, (whom hee did wel beat with a staffe, and deliuered hym to his maister. In the meane tyme the Cumanes laughed exceedingly at the Asse, whiche was supposed lately to be a Lion, especially those whom hee had welnigh driuen out of their wyttes. Wee can hardely hide those faultes, whiche wee haue vsed from oure chyldhood. A wicked ma hauing committed many heynous offences, for which he was often apprehended and committed to prison, where he was kepte very straightly, besought the helpe of a Diuell, whiche often had ayded and deliuered him out of trouble. At length he was taken again, who (as he wonted) required succoure of the Diuell: who came to him, carying a great bundell of shooes on his shoulders and sayd: friend, I can helpe thee no longer, for I haue trotted to so many places for thy deliueraunce, that I haue worne out all these shooes, and I haue no money left me to bye any more, wherfore thou must needes perishe. Lette vs not beleeue alwayes to scape scotfree with our faultes. What time the Camell was first seen, he was much dreaded, and bicause of his hugenesse, men fled from him. But in processe of time, his tamnesse being knowen, they tooke a good hart and came to him: afterward vnderstanding the beastes courage, they so farre forth despised him, that they put a byt in his mouth, and deliuered him to be driuen by boyes. Custome & dayly copanie, make terrible things to be litle set by. There was a Foxe which had not ben vsed to the sight of a Lion, whome when he sawe by chaunce once or twise, he quaked for feare and fled away: As he mette him ye third time, he stood nothing in doubt of him, but boldly approched and saluted him. Familiar conuersation maketh men bold, euen with those whome they were afrayd afore to looke on. Sometime a Hinde calfe sayd to a Hart, Father thou art borne greater and swifter than Dogges, thou hast hornes also to reuenge thee, why then doest thou so feare them? whereat he laughed, saying: Thou tellest truthe, but I know this one thing, that as soone as I heare the Dogge barke, I am fayne to flie away, but how it cometh I can not tell. They which of nature are fearefull, by no persuasion can be boldned. A Lyon hearing a voyce, came foorth leaping, wherewith sodenly afrayde, he stood still, wayting for some straunge sight: at length a litle Frogge came forth of the water: whome when the Lion had espied, (all feare set a parte) he came neerer and dashed him in pieces with his foote. This fable forbiddeth vayn feare. The Egle for his beautie preferred him selfe before all other birds, which thing al did affirme that it was true, but the Pecock sayd to him selfe: Thy feathers make not thee beautifull, but thy bill and thy talands, bicause none of vs dare cotend with thee about their beautie for feare of them. Mightier mens affaires are praysed of many, more for feare than truthe. A certein Dog as oft as it rayned durst not come foorth of the house, and being demaunded of an other Dog why he did so, aunswered: bycause sometime I was scalded with hot water. They which haue tasted of great euils, are afrayd of the smallest. A Cock being taken by a Foxe, escaped from him very hardly. Not long after, he sawe a Foxes skin, wherewith beyng sore afrayd, ran away, whome other birds mocked that he was afrayd of nothing. Ah (quod hee) if ye had bin in the Foxes gripes as I haue bin, ye would be afryad of his foote steps, how much more of his skin? They whiche haue escaped great daungers, dread the least. A sick man being demauded of the Phisitian how he did, aunswered: that he swette more than needed. Well (quod the Phisitian) that is good. The second time being asked, how he did, sayd: I shiuer and quake sore: that is good (quod the other.) The third time he demaunded his pacient as before, who aunswered, that he had the dropsy: that is also good sayd the Phisitian. Then one of the household asked him, how hee did: in fayth (quod hee) through so many good things I perish. We ought chiefly to abhorre the which only speake to delight the eare. A Rauen sometime hauing got his pray, made a great noyse in the boughes, whom the Foxe seeing thus reioyse, ranne vnto hir and sayd: I greete you with al my harte, I haue often heard reports to be vntrue, but now in deed I find it: for as I passed by this way, by chaunce I espied thee in a tree, I am therfore come vnto thee, being offended with reporte: for they saye that thou art blacker than pitch, but in my sight thou art whiter than snowe. In my iudgement thou passest the Swa, thou art fairer than white Iuie: If thy voyce were agreable to thy beautie, I would sooner acounte thee the Queene of al birds. The Rauen allured with this smoothe tale, prepared him self to sing. In the meane while the praye fell out of his bill, whiche the Foxe caught vp, laughing exceedingly, whereof the silly Rauen being ashamed, repented his follie. Eschewe vaynglorie, and that venemous secte of Flatterers may easely be auoyded: but if thou couet to be magnified, Maister Parasite wil wayte on you at an ynche. A certen man of middle age being daintily brought vp, whose hayre was halfe black halfe graye, maried two wiues at once in the spring time, whereof the one was yog, the other old, which both dwelled togither in one house: the elder bicause she wold allure him only to loue hir, dayly kemed his head,  & plucked out ye black haires. The yonger likewise (bicause she woulde entise him to hir, from the olde womans companie) plucked out his white haires. At length betwene them, they had plucked off so much haire, that he became balde and a common mocking stocke. Nothing is better for olde men, than to leaue the companie of women, especially those that be yong, excepte he wil be cloyed. A certein Souldiour being bidden of his fellowes, to helpe them at a certen Citie of Italie , which fell away from the king of Fraunce , aunswered them: If the right Lord of the soyle shal besiege the citie, who shall bring vs helpe? They sayd: The king of Fraunce . Then the Souldiour climed vp on a Tombe and cried thrice with a loude voyce, O king of Fraunce but when no answere was giuen him, he turned to them that had him, saying: I will not come thither, when hee that should helpe me ca not heare me requiring ayde. The other which went thither, were besieged of the Lord of the towne, which being wonne, they were taken and killed. They are fooles which like Harebraines put themselues in daunger. Two men iourneid togither, whereof the one founde an Axe, the other warned him that he shoulde not saye, I haue found, but we haue founde. Straight after, as they came togither to those whiche had lost it, he which had the axe, following his fellow which iorneyed with him, sayd: we are vndone, nay (quod the other) saye I am vndone not wee: for when thou foundest the axe, thou didst saye, I haue founde, not wee. They whiche were no parteners in prosperitie, are no sure friendes in miserie. A Lion and a Beare hauing got a Hindcalfe did fight togither for him. When they had long fought and were giddy and wearie, they laye downe to rest. But the Foxe went aboute them, and seeing them layd flat with the Hindecalf in the midst, ranne betwene them and tooke away the Calfe, they might see him, but coulde not arise, wherefore they sayd: what fooles are we to labor for the Foxe? Fooles lay the pooles, but wise me haue the fishe. A riche man hadde a dulhead to his seruaunt, whom he vsed to cal the king of foolish: He being often offended with hys wordes, thought he would be eue with his maister, and on a time he turned again to him and sayde: I woulde I were King of fooles, then in all the worlde there were no greater kingdome tha myne, yea and thou also shouldest be in subiection to mee. Al things are full of follie. A certen Woman of a manly courage, hadde shrewdly beaten hir Husbande, which was a coward and dolte, bicause the Kight had stolle one of the chickens, which she going foorth, left him to tende: wherefore when his Wife was absent agayne, he tyed all the chickens to one threed, and kept them more diligently, least the Kight should snatche any of them whiche he was put in trust to keepe: but the Kight comming sodenly, caught one in his clawes, whiche as he would haue caried away, he drew vp all the rest togither into the Aire. This wretched husband remembring that for one chicke lost he was so yll handeled of his wife, was afrayde of more mischief to come, and thought it therfore better to die, tha to trie his wiues fury again. Now this witty woman had put certen figs in a litle pot, wel dressed with hony and sweet spices, whereof she warned hir wise husbande, whose lickerousnesse she feared, yt he should not taste thereof, bicause presente poyson was in them. Hir husband willing to die, did eate vp all the figs, supposing that to be the best way to die  & to escape his wiues anger. When the woman came home and knew that the Kight had snatched away al hir chickens, she tooke vp a staffe and determined to beate hir husband, bicause he kept the chickens so yll: to whome hir foolish husband sayd: I praye thee wife beate me not now being ready to die, for I haue eaten vp all the poyson in the glasse, to punish my selfe for my faulte. Then the woman turning hir anger into laughter, forgaue hir husband, whiche for keeping hir chickens yll, otherwise contented hir. There is no fitte remedie against fooles. Sometime Fishers went a fishing: wherwith being weary and hadde caught nothing, they were very sorie and minded to departe: forthwith a Tunny being chased by an other great fishe, skipped into their boate, whom they tooke  & departed merily. Fortune commonly giueth that, which by cunning can not be got. A certen man being maruellous weary of the great abundance of his riches, offered a begger an .100. crowns, if he wold go to Fortune (whiche dwelled in the furthest partes of the world) and beseche hir in his name to bestowe no more goods vppon him. The poore man being agast bicause of the trauaill of so long a iourney, refused at the firste: but afterwarde chaunging his minde, and promising that he would goe, the riche man sayd he would giue but .90. The poore man supposing it to be a small rewarde for so great paynes, first woulde not agree therevnto, but after requiring 90. the rich man could hardly be persuaded to giue him .80. The begger refusing that summe, and after requiring it, the other rebated always ten fro the number which he offred, till it came but to ten pieces. At length the begger, whiche refused .100. Crownes, being forced by pouertie, tooke the .10. Crownes, and went vnto Fortune, whome with many prayers he besought to giue no more goods to the riche man, but rather that she would be bountiful to him, which from his tender age had liued in continuall pouertie, who fortune aunswered: I haue determined to double yea  & treble the riche mans goods whiche sent thee whether he will or not, but thee will I make to liue continually in extreme pouertie: besides that, thou shouldest neuer haue had ye 10. Crownes which thou receyuedst, had I not ben very fast a sleepe. Against a miserable person Fortune always frowneth, but to a Fortunate person she is cotinually beneficiall euen against his will. A Phisitian hauing the cure of a sick ma, whose chaunce was to die, sayd to them which caried the corps, this ma if he had refrayned wine  & taken clisters, had bin aliue at this day: the one of the that were by answered: Sir your aduise shoulde haue ben shewed whe it might haue done good, & not now when it is too late to call him backe. Friendes should helpe in time of neede. There was a Countreyman very poore, but yet so merie conceyted, yt in his most miserie he forgat not his natural pleasantnesse. It happened that his ferme house by chaunce was set on fire, whiche burned so sore, that he mistrusted ye quenching, which with heauie cheere he beheld. In the meane time he espied a Mouse running out of the ferme, which made hast to escape burning. The Countryman forgetting his losse, ran after the mouse, caught him, and flong him into the midst of the fire saying: Thou vnthankfull beast, in time of my prosperitie thou dwelledst with me, now bicause Fortune is chaunged, thou hast left my house. Those are no true friends which cleaue to thee like a burre in thy felicity, but in aduersitie swiftly runne away. The Lion intended to get him a companion, wherevpon many beastes desired to be matched with him, yea and instantly required it, but he sette light by them, and chose only ye hog into his fellowship, wherso being demauded ye cause answered: this beast is so faithfull that he neuer forsaketh his friends or fellowes in the greatest dauger that can be. We seeke the friendship of those men which in time of need cleaue to vs, and not those which giue vs the slippe. A certen shepherd gaue his Dog charge ouer his sheep to looke to the, for whiche he fed him with the best meate. Neuerthelesse the Dog often killed a sheepe and deuoured him, whiche when the shepherd had espied, caught the Dogge and woulde haue killed him. Why (quod the dogge) wouldest thou destroy me? I am one of the houshold, slay the wolf rather which continually lyeth in wayte to destroy thy sheep. Nay (quod the shepherd) I think thee rather worthy of death than the wolf, for he is my open enimie, but thou vnder the colour of friendship doest dayly decrease my flocke. They are more greuously to be punished which vnder ye pretence of friedship do hurt vs, than those whiche shewe them selues to be our open enimies. A Lark being caught in a net, wept and sayd: Woe is mee wretch and vnhappy birde, for I haue taken from no man either gold, siluer, or any other precious thing, but for a litle grain of corne I must die. This fable is against those which for a trifling gayne put them selues in daunger. A wild Asse seeing a tame Asse in a suny place, went to him and accounted him blissed, bicause he had good feeding and was in good lyking: afterward seing him beare burthens, and the horsekeeper follow, stryking him with a staff, he sayd: I think thee now no more happy, for I see ye with much sorow thou enioyest this felicitie. Gayn full of miserie and daunger, is not to be followed. A Theefe somtime offred a Dog a piece of bread to stop his mouth withall, to whom he answered: I know thy pretence, thou giuest me a piece of bread to leaue my barking, but thy gift I vtterly abhorre, for if I receyue this bread, thou wilt carie away all things out of this house. Take heede that for a litle lucres sake thou loose not a great thing: beware how thou trustest euery man: for some there are whiche vnder a colour, not only will pretende friendship in worde, but also in deed. What time as trees had their proper language, a Countryman came into the Woode and required a handle for his Axe, they graunted his requeste. When he had well mended his Axe, he began to cut downe the trees: then the Wood al too late repented his gentlenesse, and was full sory that he had made a rod for his owne tayle. Take heed who thou pleasurest, for many hauing receyued good turnes, haue abused it to ye destructio of ye giuer. A certaine countreyman being in lawe vp to the eares, came to a Counseller, to the end that by his help he might winde him selfe out of the lawe. But this Counseller being otherwise occupied, sente hym woorde that he had no leysure to talk with him now, praying him to returne an other time. The Countreyman accounting him for his sure friend, came often, but coulde not speake with him. At length he returned ageyne and brought with him a yong sucking Kid and fat, with which he stood at the Lawyers gate, and often plucked him to make him bleate: the Porter (whome his master commaunded to open the gates to them that broughte presentes) hearyng the voyce of the Kid, streight way opened the gate, and bade him come in: Then the Countryman turned to the Kid, and sayde: I thank thee my little Kid, for thou art the cause that I come in so lightly. Nothing is so hard, but with gifts it is mollifyed. What tyme as Iupiter made a feast at a mariage, al beasts brought in their presents, euery one after his habilitie, among whom the Serpent was with a rose in his mouthe, whiche he offered: Iupiter seeing him, sayde aloude, euery mans beneuolence I williugly accept, but thine in no wise I will receiue. The wise man may well gesse that the wicked offer nothing without a crafty pretence. Flies flew into a holeful of honie, wherof they did eate: their feete stucke fast therein, that they coulde not escape, who being nigh choaked, sayde: Ah wretches, which for a little meate doe perishe. Gluttonie is the cause of muche euill to many. on water and on lande, whervpon they sente for them, and after communication hadde, they gaue the warnyng to medle no more vpon lande, vpon payn of their liues. Dere sisters (quod they) this talke lyketh not vs very well, neuerthelesse if ye will vouchesafe to take parte with vs, our hearts shal be much lightened, and we the better contented to obey your request. The Birds of the lande by reason of theyr gluttonie, desiryng to eate of the meate in the water, flew altogither with them into the water, but bicause they coulde not swimme, they were in great hazard of drowning, wherfore they besoughte them to take pitie on them: the Waterfoules being mercyfull, tooke them vp on their backes, and brought them to lande: for whiche deede the Landbirdes gaue vnto the Waterfoules free libertie to feede bothe on the water and on the lande. Gluttonous persons thynke all too little that goeth besides their owne mouth. An Egle came down from an high rock and light on a lambs back, which thing the Rauen seeing, desired to counterfet him in his dooings, and disceded vppon a Ram, where bicause his claws stuck fast, he was caught and cast out to play withall. Let no man account of himselfe by an other mans manhod, but by his own power. Cut thy cote after thy cloth. Two yong me came into a Cookes shop as though they woulde haue boughte meate, the Cooke beeing occupied, the one stole a peece of meate out of the basket, and gaue it his felow to hide vnder his garmet: the Cooke perceiuing yt a peece of flesh was gone, accused them bothe of theft: then hee that tooke it, swore by Iupiter he had it not: the other that had it, swore that he tooke it not, wel (quod the Cooke) the theefe I know not, but he that you haue sworne by, bothe sawe and knoweth the theefe. If we haue ought offended, men know it not streight way, but God that rideth on the heauens and beholdeth the depthes of the sea, seeth al things: if men would remember this, they woulde offende lesse. Sometyme Money being demaunded of vertue, why she rather went to the euill than the good, aunswered: bycause good men brought vp in thy schoole neuer learned too lye and forswere, and to occupy vsurie, and to robbe others, for these things are wont to draw me vnto them: forsooth (quod vertue) I had rather that my scholers lyued in pouertie, than they shoulde defile them selues with these vices, for both of them haue a short ende: the good leauing euerlastyng glorie vpon earth, flie vp to the kingdome of heauen: but the euill with slaunder ynough, leauing their riches, shal go downe to the bottome of Hell. Gather riches after no yll way, for it will not only bring in this lyfe an euill reporte, but also after death perpetuall torment. A wilde Gote somtime came to a Thorn which was new sprong vp, whereof he fed him selfe ful: Not long after, the Gote remembring the good taste of the Thorne, returned vnto it, mynding to feede thereof as before, but the Thornes being hardned, stoocke fast as shee would haue swallowed them in hir throte & the roofe of hir mouth: The Gote with payne thus vexed, spake opprobriously ageynst the Thorne, saying: Ah wretche, thy beginning was good, but now thou hast little vauntaged me. Many men likewise begin wel, but their end is yll, whereby they bring the curse vpon them. The Uine sayd to the Gote, thou hurtest me by shearing my leaues: thou knowest I am no grasse, but though thou doo me this harme, I will prouide great plentie of Wyne to sacrifice thee to the Gods. Commonly a man helpeth hym, to whome he would do some mischiefe. An Ant being thirstie came to a wel to drinke, wherin by mischaunce he fell, whiche a Doue far off espying, cast downe a bough from an high tree, and holpe him: the Ant clymed vp theron,  & escaped. Immediatly after, a Fowler set vp his nettes to catche the Doue: then the Ant for to recompence his benefactoure, came softely stealyng on the Fowler, and bit his foote, wherby the Doue flew away. We must requite a good turne with the like. A Gardiner taking a Mole wold haue killed hir, to whome she saide, I pray thee good maister, kill not me thy poore seruant which haue so faire a skin, and doth digge vp thy gardins for nothing: Ah (quod the Gardiner) thou shalt not pacifie me with these flattering words, bycause that in digging vp my gardins ageinst my will, as thou sayest, thou rootest vp al the herbes to feed thyself,  & to bring me to beggers state. In all things the good will of men is to be marked. The Mise assembled together and tooke counsel by what policie or cunning they might escape the Cats wyles: then one which in age and experiece passed the rest, sayd: I haue found a way which shall saue vs harmlesse from so greate dangers, if yee will be ruled by mee: lette vs hang a Bell aboute hir necke, by the sounde whereof, wee shal know and perceyue the comming of the Catte: then all with one voyce commended his counsel as good, and sayde, they must so doe. Then an other elder than the rest starte vp, commaunding silence, and sayde: I also allowe this opinion, but who will be so hardie, that dare hang the Bell about the Catts neck? but when euery one refused to do it, their talke was in vaine. Many comend those things that ought to be done, but few are founde to execute the same. On a tyme Fishers drew their nets out of the sea, whiche they perceiuing to be heauie, reioyced greately, supposyng they had a great multitude of Fishes, but when they drew the nette to lande and founde a great stone but few Fishes, they waxed heuie, not for the small number, but bicause it fel out otherwise than they iudged: then one of the company being an auncient ma sayd: let vs not be grieued: for sorow waiteth vpon pleasure, and therfore we ought to be sory in some thing, bicause we reioyced so much before. We ought not to be greued, being defeated of our purpose. A hunter pursued wylde Beastes with dartes, wherevppon the Tygre commaunded all other beasts to depart, and he only would end that fight: the Hunter stil cast his dartes, the Tygre foorthwith was wounded: As hee fled out of the fielde and drewe oute the darte, the Foxe asked who had so sore wounded so valiant a beast: he aunswered, that the doer he knew not, but by the greatnesse of the wounde, he toke it to be some man. Strong men for the most part are more hardy than needeth, but cunning passeth force, and policie strength. As a Sowe was ready to farrowe, the Wolfe came vnto hir, promisyng to be a safegarde for hir yong Pigges: she answered: Of thy seruice I haue no neede, but if thou wilte be accouted religious, or shewe mee any pleasure, I pray thee depart further from mee, for with thyne absence thy seruice shall stande mee in better stede than with thy presence. All men deserue not credit in all things: for many promyse their endeuor not for thy sake, but for their owne commoditie. A certein man hadde a great Cheese in a coffer, which a Mouse had tasted, therfore by the cousel of a friend of his, he shut in the Cat there, which after she had killed the Mouse, deuoured the whole Cheese. Those oughte to bee no kepers, which can no lesse hurt vs than our enimies. had often sayd that so derely shee loued him that if shee might wish shee would redeeme his life with hir death, he willingly let fall vpon both their bare feete a burning stick. Then the woman being in paine, and forgetting the loue she bare to hir husbande, bidde shake off the burning sticke from hir feete onely. Credite not women when they say they loue their husbands better than themselues. A Cock and a Capon dwelled together in a poultry house, but the Cock was lord of the Hens, and the Capon fed amongst them: It happened that a Fox caught this Cock, and deuoured him, and his combe he touched not, but kept it safe and brought it to the Capon, saying: O brother capon, thy fellow is dead, wherfore I haue broughte thee his combe euen for pure loue which I beare to thee, nowe if it please thee to come downe, I wil crown thee, that thou mayst take the regiment of the Hens as the cock dyd: the Capon being ambitious  & greedie of promotio, flew down from his roost, and cam to ye Fox, who reioycing therof, caught the Capon incontinent, and killed hym. Take hede how thou credit al me. A Fowler set his nets for birds, whom ye Larke a far of espying, asked him what he did, he answered, yt he built a Citie, then he went a good way back, and hid himselfe: the Lark crediting his woordes came to the nette and was taken: too it the Fowler ranne, to whom the Larke sayd: Friend, if thou buylde suche a Citie, thou shalte fynde fewe dwellers therein. Houses and Cities then chiefly become desolate, when the Rulers are busy bodies. desirous in all the haste to be riche, killed the Goose, hopyng that there was some hidden Treasure within hir: and then finding hir emptie, the wretche was amazed, and after mourned and syghed, that he had loste both his hope and substance. Wee muste measure oure affections and that we be not to hastie, for hast maketh wast, and he that all wold haue, sometyme loseth all. A lewde woman wept bitterly for hir louer ready to depart from hir, whom she had nere polled of al that he had: whervppon hir neighbour demaunded the cause why shee wept so comfortles, forsooth (quod shee) his departing doth not greue me, but the cloke which I left him to put on. Harlots loue not their louers, but their Money. A Serpent lurking in the entry of a husbandmans house, slue his boye, for whome his parentes mourned muche, but his father for sorow tooke an axe, went out  & would haue killed the Serpent, the Husbandman seeing him looke vp, made hast to strike hym, but he missed him, for he stroke the mouth of his hole: when the Serpente was gone in and the Husbandeman thinking that he had forgot the wrong, he came and set bread and salte before his hole, but the Serpent softely hissing, sayde: Hereafter neither trust or friendship shall bee betweene vs as long as I see a stone and thou thy sons graue. None forgetteth hatred or vengeance as long as he seeth the cause of his greefe. A certain man hauing buried his wyfe, whiche hee loued wel, and maried a widow which dayly layd in his dish the malynesse of hir former husband: he bycause he wold be eue with hir, dasht in hir teeth his other wiues honest behauiour and chast liuing. It happned on a time, when she was angry, a begger came too the dore, & asked theyr almes, to whome she gaue a peece of Capon which she for hir owne supper and hir husbandes boyled, saying: I giue thee this for the soule of my first husband: Hir good man hearing that, called the poore ma and gaue him the rest of the Capon, saying: I giue thee this for the soule of my Wyfe that is dead: By whych meanes either spytyng other at length had nothing for theyr supper. We muste not fight with those that can reuenge their quarell. A Wolfe espyed twoo Dogs, which were keepers of the flock of sheepe, fighting together, and with theyr byting tearyng eche other, was in good hope that he might safely assaulte the sheepe. Therefore with greate violence he ran vpon the sheepe, and tooke a fat one quickly, with whiche he fled away speedily. The Dogs seing that, lefte off their stryfe, and ouertooke the Wolfe runnyng away, whome they wounded so sore that he could scarce escape: but streight after being demaunded by an other Wolf why he sette on the flocke alone, where so strong resisters were? In fayth (quod he) I was deceyued by their mutuall fighting. The hatred whiche we beare to straungers, are woont to set at one the debate betweene neighbours. A Countryman draue by the way a spare Horse, and an Asse sore laden wyth packs, the Asse being weary with trauayling, prayed the Horse if he would saue his lyfe, to ease him somewhat of his burthen; the Horse thoughte skorne and denyed his helpe: It hapned as they trauayled on in their iorney yt the Asse being ouerladen, fel vnder his burthen  & dyed: then his master layde al ye asses burthen & eke the skin vpon the horse, wherwithall his backe began to crack: Ah wretch yt I am, sayd the Horse, I am thus iustly serued, bycause lately I refused to help the poore laboring Asse. We must help oure frends that are in miserie, for part of our rising our country claimeth, and part our friends. A Foxe being falne in to a Well, and at the poynt to be drowned, besought the Wolfe which was on the welles brink to cast downe a rope and helpe him vp: The Wolfe sayd: How fellest thou in here? Ah (quod the Foxe) this is no time to tell thee, but when thou hast drawne me out, I wil shew thee all things in order. Men in danger had need of present help, & not spend the tyme in ydle talke. A Pig wept muche for the death of his parents, but when he had red his will and founde that a greate heape of Acornes and many bushels of meale were left him, he held his peace: and being asked why hee wept no more, answered: The meale and the Acornes haue stopped vp my mouth. A greate heritage causeth the heyres quickely to leaue theyr mourning. The Cockatrice on a time went to the sea side in the clothing of a Monke, and called to him the Wolf saying: O brother, since thou wast marked with the signe of the crosse, thou art become a perfecte Christian, I pray thee therefore come vnto mee, and instruct me in the faith of Christe, that I may be baptized, and therby escape euerlasting iudgement, and haue fruition of eternall ioye. The Wolf fishe marking him well and knowing what he was, sayde: O thou Hipocrite, a coule maketh not a Frier, thy wordes are full of wickednesse and craft, neyther entendest thou to be baptized of me, but rather thou wouldst begyle and poyson mee: therfore I wil not heare thee, and forthwith he swam away, and left him all ashamed. Beware of those which come in sheeps clothing outwardly, but inwardly are rauening wolues. A Wolf met a dog by chaunce very early going through a Wood, who he curteously saluted, being very glad of his coming: at length he asked him by what meanes he was in so good lyking: he aunswered, that his maister loued him dearly, for whe he fawned on him, he stroked him, and fed him with meate fro his table, and that he neuer slept by daylight: moreouer, time would not serue to tell how muche I am made off by all the seruauntes. Mary sayd the Wolfe, thou arte happie in deede, which hast so good and so louing a maister, if I might dwell with him, I would think myselfe the happiest of all liuing beastes. The Dog perceyuing the Wolf very desirous to chaunge his accustomed trade of liuing, promised his help to bring it to passe, that he might be retayned to his maister, so that he were content to become tamer,  & to liue in bondage: The Wolfe was content and it pleased him well to walke towarde the Towne. By the way they had very pleasaunt talke, but when it waxed light day, the Wolfe perceyued the Dogs necke worne bare, wherevppon he asked him, what ment this barenesse of his neck, he aunswered, the cause is, that when I was fierce, I barked at my friends as well as my foes, and sometime did byte them, wherewithall my Maister not well pleased, did beate me often, forbidding me to assaulte any, saue a theefe or a Wolfe, and by this meanes I am tamer and cary the mark in remembraunce of my fiercenesse: the Wolfe hearing him say so, told him he would not bye his Lords loue so deare, saying, farewel therfore, for I esteeme my libertie far better than this bondage. Better is a drie morfell in a lowe house where a man is ruler, than in the kings pallace to fare delicatly, and to be in seruitude: for libertie in the courte hath no place. A certe Linnet was kept up daintily by a rich man, who much delighted in his singing. It happened in time of dearth, that many poore birds came to ye Linnet  & asked his almes, but nothing would he giue the, saue of the fragments & broken meate that was lefte, whiche he cared not for, but the birds reioysing therof, eate it vp sweetely. It is an yll dish, which a man wil refuse when he is hungry. A Mule being fat and pricked with prouender, cryed aloude and sayde: My Father is a swift running horse, and I am altogether like him, but once when he shold needes runne, and in running stayed, he straight way remembred that he was an Asses foale. Though time bring a man to promotion, yet ought he not to forget his estate, for this life is vnstable. A certein King of Egipt appointed Apes to be taught to daunce, whiche as no beast is of liker fauoure to a man, so none counterfaiteth better or willinglier a man in his dooings. They hauing learned very quickly the arte of dauncing: on a daye appointed they beganne to daunce and were clad with the richest purple. Their dauncing delighted the companie a long time, vntill a merie conceyted fellow cast down amongst them nuts, whiche he priuily had caried in his bosome: the Apes had no sooner seene the nuts, but forgetting ye dauce, became as they were aforetime: of dauncers, Apes, byting and tearing their clothes in pieces,  & fighting togither for the nuts, not without great laughter of ye beholders. The giftes of Fortune chaunge not a mans disposition. A Heardman entred the stable and saw the Oxen skipping for ioy, he therefore axed them the cause of their ioy, they answered: Our hope is to spende this daye in the goodly leasues. Why (quod hee) What thing that brought you to this hope? We dreamed sayd they, it should be so: Ah (quod hee) giue no credit to such dreames, whiche ye are like to finde vntrue, for I dreamed that ye should ploughe to daye, and mens dreames are wont to be truer tha beastes. Nothing is so soone begyled, as the hope of men. A Hog was blamed of a sheep that he yelded no profit to his Maister, of whome he was so diligently fed: seeing they gaue him milke, wooll and lambes. He aunswered: when I am dead, my fruite commeth in, for he feedeth me for a purpose. None wil take paynes without hope of reward. A certein rich man hid a treasure in the wood, wherof none knew but his Godfather, whom he greatly trusted. But whe he came within few dayes after to see it, he found that it was digged vp & caried away: he therfore iudged (as it was in deed) that his Godfather had taken it away: he went and spake with him, saying: Godfather, I will also hide a .1000. crownes more where my treasure is. Hee being desirous to gayn more, brought again the treasure and layd it where it was: whe the true owner came shortly after thither and found it, he tooke it home with him and went to his Godfather and sayd: Thou promisse breaker, bestow no more labor in vayne to goe to the treasure, for thou shalt find it no more. It is an easy thing to deceyue a couetous man with hope of money. The Pigard sometyme being pursued by a Hauke, fiyed to the Eagle for sauegard, saying: Thou arte great and mercifull, therefore came I to thee for ayde and succoure, which am small and weake, crauing that I may be vnder the shadowe of thy wings, to defende me from the furie of my enimie. The Eagle moued with pitie and compassion, sayd: Bicause of thy lowlinesse and imbecillitie abyde with mee,  & feare nothing as long as thou arte in my companie. They that are mightie, ought to defende the meeke and lowly. A Dog brake loose and ranne into a kitchen, where he stole away a Harte whiles the Cooke was otherwise occupied, who turning about and seeing him running, sayd: Truste me, where soeuer thou become, I will watche thee, for thou haste not taken a harte from mee, but rather gyuen me a harte. Often harmes are warnings to a man. A certeyn man being stoned to death of the people, rose agayne: who beyng asked of one, what did most greeue him in that stoning, sayd: Nothing so much as the stone which one did throwe whome I supposed to be my friende, although it touched mee not. The hurte done by our friendes doth more greeue vs, than that whiche our enimies doe. A Sheep being caught by a Dogge which was keeper of the flocke, made a great crying, but being taken by the Wolfe, did not crie at all: who being demaunded of the shepherd, why she did so? aunswered: It greeueth me more to be hurt of the dog, which should be my keeper and friend, than of the Wolfe, who naturally is my foe. The hurt by them of the houshold done, more hurteth than that whiche is done by straungers. A Rauen lacking meate, see a Serpente sleeping on a sunnie banke, at whome he flewe downe and caught him vp: who turned again and byt him: the Raue therwith with nighe dead sayde: Ah wretch that I am, which haue found such againe wherof I perishe. This fable is against him, which by finding a treasure, hath put him selfe in daunger of his life. A certeyn poore Man had nothing but a house vnderset with shores, whiche was like to fall. It happened on a tyme as he returned from the fieldes, he found it fallen, and bicause he had not wherewith to set it vp agayne, he was so muche troubled in his minde, that he fell to mourning and weeping out of measure. But as this poore man thus made his moane, he espied a brasen pot, whiche many yeares had ben hidden in the Wall, lying amongest the stones and rubbishe, which when he hadde taken vp and opened, he founde it full of golde, wherwith his hart hopping for ioy, he left off his weeping. Sometime that we thinke hurtfull, turneth to oure great profite and commoditie. A certeyn learned man being bidden to the feaste of a Prince, and commaunded to sit down in the neathermost roomes, when the other guestes had great fishes set before the, but to him very small ones, he did eate none, but put them firste one after an other to his mouth, the to his eares, as though he would demaunde some thing of them,  & after layde them downe whole & untouched in the dishes again: whome the maister of the feast asked why he did so? he aunswered, two yeere agoe in these parties my father through shipwracke was cast away, and what became of his body I could not afterwards knowe, I did therefore demaunde of these litle fishes if they could tel any tydings of him, but they aunswered, yt at that time they were not bredde: wherefore I must aske the greater Fishes. The Prince hearing so merry a saying, commaunded of the greater fishes to be set before him, and euer after he placed him amongst his chiefest guestes. Amongst vnlearned me, learning is not so profitable to the learned as is pleasaunt and mery talke. An olde Woman being troubled with payn of hir eyes, bargained with a Phisitian for a certen summe of money to pay him if he healed hir: if not, he should haue nothing. The Phisitian went about his cure, who dayly came and anoynted hir eyes, but she (that houre he dressed hir) cold see nothing: then hee at his departure, caried some thing out of the house. The olde woman see hir stuff dayly decrease, so that whe she was healed, scarse any thing was left, to whom when the Phisitian came  & required his bargain, bicause she could see clearely, and thereof brought witnesses, she sayd: Truely I rather see lesse than before, for whe I was blind I could see much stuff in my house, but now that I can see, as thou sayst, I perceyue nothing of yt which I had. Wicked persons not knowing what they doe, speake often against themselues. A certen man had two Dogs, whereof ye one he taught to hunt, the other to keep his house, if it chaunced the hounde to catch any thing, he whiche kept him was partaker any thing, he whiche being offended, cast oft in his fellowes teeth that he dayly tooke payres, and the other did nothing, and yet he was fed with his trauaill: his fellowe aunswered and sayde: Blame not me but my Maister, whiche neuer taught me to labor, but to eate that an other hath swet for. Yong men which know nothing, are not to be blamed, seeing their Parents brought them vp so. A Husbandman complayned that ye sheep destroyed all his Corne, wherevppon Iupiter commaunded the sheep to feed temperately, and bicause they obeyed not his will, the Wolfe was appointed to afflicte them moderately. But when the shepherd complayned that all his flocke was killed by the Wolfe, Iupiter was offended, and bad the Hunter kil the Wolf, which thing he quickly did. No immoderate thing is continuall. The Larke came to the Owle and sayd: Deare sister, I pray thee beare me companie to morowe at noone, for my louer desireth to see me by Sunne light: Nowe if I be matched with thee, I shall seeme more beautifull. The Owle promised to be there, for he was ashamed to sticke with hir for so small a trifle. When day was vp and the Sunne did shyne very cleare, the Larke wayted for him, but the Owle durst not appeare by Sun light, bicause she could not see, and therfore came not, wherwith ye Lark being offended, alwayes after abhorred and pursued hir: wherefore the Owle flieth not by daye for feare of the Lark, but seeketh his meate by night. None ought to promise that, which he can not performe. The Reed was displeased that not onely all other trees, but also sometime grasse did beare a nest, but he only of that honour was depriued: he therefore prayed a litle birde to build hir nest vpon him, so would I (quod she) but I mistrust thy inconstacy, for I wil not build my childrens house vpon so ticklish a foundation. We ought not to commit our selues or our children to inconstant persons. we are so neere kin and so like? Mary (quod hee) If they hunte mee, they seldome scape scot free. They are least hurt, whiche vse to reuenge their iniuries A Crowe lighted on a sheeps back  & made a great noyse, then sayde the sheepe: If thou shouldest do so to a dog, thou mightest chaunce catch copper. Yea (sayd the Crow) I know with whome I deale, for I am to the pacient greeuous, and to the angry plesaunt. The wicked striue cotinually with the feeble and simple folke: the innocent is troden vnder foote, but no man gayn sayeth the vngodly, if he be stout. The Ape prayed the Foxe to giue him a piece of his tayle to couer his buttockes withall, bicause that whiche to him was a burthen, would stande him in good steede and do him much worship. The Foxe aunswered and sayd, that she hadde nothing too much, and she had rather sweep the ground therewith, than it shoulde couer the Apes buttockes. Some haue great scarcitie, and some haue great plentie, yet fewe riche men are so well bent as to helpe the poore with any thing of their excesse and superfluitie. The Frogges reioysed at the mariage of the Sunne, to whome one sayde: O wretched kinde, if we only feare the sunne beames, who will abyde hym if he gette children? This Fable is agaynst those, which ignorauntly reioyce at their owne harme. A Foxe espying a Wolfe fallen into a hole, did laugh, and reioycing skipped about the brinkes of the Pit, calling him foolish beaste, which would not beware of mens deceytes. As he thus wantonly scoffed, the earth fayled, and caried him headlong in also: whome the Wolfe seeing to fall, sayd: I shall nowe cary a great comfort of my death to hell, bicause I see the Foxe, (whiche mocked me) perishe with mee. We ought not reioyce at an others miserie, seing we may fal into the same likewise. A certeyn man had two Hogges which bare so mortall hatred one toward another, that dayly they tore eche other with their teeth: but when their Maister killed one of them, the other was wonderfull glad, seeing that his enimie should die incontinent: within fewe dayes after, when he him selfe was drawen to death, he tormeted him self, saying: Woe is me wretch, Why did I so reioyce ouer my enimies death, whome so soone I do followe too the same ende. None ought too reioyce, no not ouer the deathe of his enimie, seeyng it is euident that all must dye. A Wolfe put on a Sheepes skin, and was conuersant amongst the Sheepe, of whom he dayly deuoured one, which thing when the shepherd had espyed, he hanged him vp in an high tree, then other shepherds asked him why he hoong vp a Sheepe: Ah (quod he) the skin as ye see is a sheepe, but in his deedes he was a Wolfe. Men muste not be esteemed after their apparell, but after their woorkes, for many are vnder sheepes skinnes rauening Wolues. As the Lyon passed by the wilde beasts through the desert, they made theyr obeisance to him as King of beasts, only the Elephant bowed not his knee, bicause hee could not, but some beasts enuying him, reported yll of him to the Lion, hee sente for him foorthwith, and sayd: Why art thou so stubborne, that thou doest not thy dutie as the rest? My Lord, according to my power I honour thee, but I can not kneele bicause I lack knees. The Lion sayde, if thou doe it in thy harte, it suffiseth: wherefore he condemned hys accusers, and promoted the Elephant. We ought to gyue no iudgement, before the truthe be tried. The Asse in the winter season was much troubled for ye extreeme colde yt he suffered,  & yt he liued only by strawe, whervpon he wished for the spring tide, that he might feede of the sweete grasse. When the spring was come, his Maister being a potter, compelled him to carry clay into his workehouse ad wood to the furnace, and thence to cary bricke and tyle into diuers places: wherewith being anoyed, he longed for sommer, hoping the to take his ease when his maister was busie in his haruest: but then he caried wheate into the barne, and from thence home, and had no rest: wherefore he thought if Autune were once come to haue an ende of his trauaile: but he could not yet be eased of hys trauaile, but as then caried wine, fruit and wood: then he desired for frost & snow again, yt at the last he might haue some ease of his trauaile. In this life there is no time voyde of continuall labour. A certen Countryman kept an Hiue of Bees, by which he became rich: neuerthelesse he was ofte stong when he fetched away the hony cobes, where with being offended, he threatned the Bees saying: If hereafter ye touche me I will surely ouerthrowe you  & driue you away. What (quod the Bees) thou canst be content to gather ye sweete, but arte loth to tast of the soure: be quiet, or we will forsake thee. It happened, when he came again to gather hony, a Bee stong him, wherewith being mad, he ouerthrew the hiues, the the bees forsooke him, wherby ye couetous churle fel into pouerty. Who so will haue gayne, must endure some payne. A certen Husbandman came to a Poet, whose groundes he tilled, whome bycause he found alone sitting amongst his books, asked him by what meanes he could liue so solitarie? Mary (quod he) I was not alone afore thou camest here. Learned men which dayly are in company of such as they are, be neuer alone, but when they are amongest the vnlearned. A certein man being rich but vnlerned, mocked a learned ma which was poore, bicause that he hymself with his owne trauaile hadde gathered muche goodes, but he which was so learned was in great penurie: No maruaile (quod hee) bycause thou haste studied to gather Riches, but I haue endeuored to get lerning, which doth farre excell riches. Hereupon there fel a contention betweene the riche man and the learned, whither lerning or riches were more excellent, which coulde not be ended seyng both had many fauorers, but the rich man had most: At length by this meanes it was knowne that learning excelled riches, thorough ciuile discord being bothe compelled to liue in banishment, when they could cary nothing awaye with them of their substance they went away into an other citie, where the learned man was hyred to teach for a great stipende, and had in honour and estimation: but he which was rich, through pouertie being fayne to beg his bread from doore to doore, confessed that in his opinion he had erred. The gifts of Fortune, bycause they passe too and fro, are farre subiect to the gifts of the mynde, whiche are proper and euerlasting. A Parat dwelling in a kings court was asked of other birds, why shee was so highly estemed? Who aunswered, bycause I haue learned to speake as a man. Wee must learne good and liberall sciences if we wil be had in honour and estimation. As a certein Fisher angled, he so bayted his hooks that the Fishes could not perceiue them, whiche the Pyke  & the Tenche seeing, were very desyrous of it: but the Pyke being subtil sayd to the Tench: This This Bayte seemeth to be good and delicate, yet I think it is layd to deceyue fishes withall, therfore let vs forsake it least we perishe through the lustes of gluttonie. In fayth (quod the Tenche) it were a folly to leaue so good a morsel for feare of nothing: I will first trie it and make mery with it, and looke thou what will hap. As he swallowed the Bayte, he felt the deceyte of the hooke and wold fayne haue retired, but the Fisher first plucked him vp, then the Pyke swam away and sayd: Lette vs learne by our fellowes mischance, least we perishe. Happy is hee, whom other mens harmes do make to beware. A certen shamelesse and lecherous person sayling on ye sea, espied a most beautifull Mermayde, after whome he lusted so much, that he prouoked hir to lecherie, but she did sing much sweeter and prepared hir selfe to beguyle thys Marchaunt, saying: as I perceyue thou louest mee, but if thou wilt haue thy pleasure of me, come into the water, and it shall be at thy commaundement. This fellow was so enflamed wt lust, that he cleane forgot his owne estate, and therefore skipped into the Sea to hir: She seeing that, left him in great daunger and swam away. This Fable willeth vncleane men to beware that they likewise perish not through the beautie of a woma. A certeyn Ielous man maried a Wife, whom he knew vnhonest, wherevpon he deliuered hir to a trusty friend of his to keepe, promising him a great reward, if he kept hir so safely, that by no meanes the bonde of wedlocke were broken. When he had tried hir a fewe dayes and perceyued that she might hardly be kept safe, bycause through hir subtiltie he was nighe ouercome, went to hir husbande and told him that he would not take so great charge vpon him, seeing that Argus himselfe, with an hudred eyes, were not able to keepe hir by costraint: he sayd moreouer, if he might be put to choyse, he had rather by the space of one whole yeare, dayly carry into the fieldes a sacke full of fleas, and turne them all to grasse, and bring them home agayne at euening, tha one day too haue the charge of a leude woman. No keeper be he neuer so diligent can keepe safely a wanton mynion. A Frank and Liberall man toward all me, trauailing far, fel amogst theeues, who standing about him, and ready to slay him, one of them cried out: kill not this man which hath much holpen me, for somtime, he did not only receiue me getly into his house, but also norished me being sick, and caused a phisitian too looke vnto me, with which woords his felowes relenting, suffred him to depart vnhurt. As far as we may, we shoulde do good to all men. A uery harde head bought a riche farme and plentifull, whiche was set with al kinde of Trees that bare fruite, which yelded to the former lord greate abundance of frute, although it were vnfensed and common for all trauailers: the new lord supposing that if it were dressed better and looked too, it would beare fruite more aboundantly, tooke great paynes about it, and inclosed it with thicke hedges and walles, & appointed keepers to watch it, but it being so diligently tended, yelded litle encrease. Then God being asked wherof this came, aunswered thus: Thou art the cause of so great euill, bicause thou keepest on euery side the fields fenced with hedges & strong walles: sometime I gaue great encrease bicause many required much, but now seeing it serueth thee alone, why doest thou aske so much? God gyueth plenty to a liberall man, bycause he might supplie the necessitie of many. A Dog by chaunce met with a Lyon, to whom he sayd meryly, what wandrest thou (O miser) through woods and deserts nighe pined for hunger? Marke how fatte and trim I am: I neuer take payns for it, but get it ydelly Truthe it is (sayd ye Lyo) that thou farest well, yet thou (O foole) art in bondage, serue thou which canst serue, for I am free and will not serue. In euery thing liberty farre excelleth. A boy asked a Linnet in whome he had a singular delight, and had fedde hym fat with good meate, why he would not returne into the cage whence he went out? Bycause (quod hee) I might feede at my owne pleasure, not at thine. Libertie is to be prefered aboue all dainties. The Foxe and the Crocodile dyd stryue about their Nobilitie: The Crocodile layd for him selfe many proud things concerning the worthinesse of his auncesters, that they had prices in games. Whereat the Foxe laughed, saying: Trulye friend, though thou neuer namedst that, yet it appeareth by thy skin, that thou haste bin a great dooer in old time. The thing it selfe reproueth lyers of their falshood. A boy kept sheep in a great pasture, who three or foure tymes dyd crye in ieste that the Wolfe was come: whiche thing caused the Husbande men (oute of euery Quarter of the Countreys) to assemble there. It chaunced verely, that the Wolfe came at length, and the Boy called for help as before, but they being oft deluded, wold not once stirre out of their doores, whereby the sheepe were all destroyed. He that vseth lying, though he chaunce once to tell a truthe, shall not soone be credited. make them lye, which when he had well stamped and measured, he poured it equally vpon euery one. The shoomaker only remayned, on whom (bycause muche of the medicine was left) he poured all in the morter: whereof it came to passe, that all craftes men are lyers, but moste of all are shoomakers. This Fable is against lying workmen. A certeyn olde Man being thrust out of doores by his Sonne, liued in an Hospitall. On a time he espied his sonne trauayling that way, whom he prayed, that at the least he would sende him two towels of all his linnen, for which he had swet full sore: who being at length moued with his Fathers prayers, commaunded a litle Boye his sonne, to fetche his Grandfather ye linnen that he required. The Boy being witty and worthy of such a father, brought but one, whom his Father rebuked bycause he brought not two as he was bidden: forsoth (quod hee) I keepe the other for thee, yt when thou arte old and liuest in an Hospitall, I might sende it to thee. Looke what loue we beare toward our Parentes, the same will our children beare toward vs. A certen Knight had a Falcon, of whom he much reioyced, whome he alwayes caried on his fiste, and fed him well, but on a tyme he lette hys Falcon flie, bycause he would cal hir to his hand, and whistled for hir, but the Falcon would not come down. A Cock seeing this, exalted him selfe, saying: What doe I poore wretch alwayes liuing in durte and myre, am I not as fayre and as great as the Falcon? Sure I will light on hys gloue and be fedde with my Lords meate. When he had lighted on hys fiste, the Knight (though he were sory) yet somwhat reioyced  & tooke the Cock, whom he killed, but hys fleshe he shewed to the Falcon, to bring him againe to his hand, which the Falcon seeing, came hastily too it. Let euery man walke in his vocation, and let no man exalte him selfe aboue his degree. A Camell being weary of his estate, coplayned that the Buls had goodly hornes, but he him selfe had no defence to resiste other beastes: He therefore besought Iupiter to gyue hym hornes also: Who laughed at his foolish request, whereof not only he was denied, but also had his eares cropped. Lette euery man be content with his calling, for as some hunte after better fortune, they happen to worse. The Asse complayned that he lacked hornes, and the Ape that he wated a tayle. Peace fooles (quod the Mole) for I am blind also. Some are not content with their estate, but if they wayed well other mens misfortunes, they woulde quietlier endure their owne. A Snayle espied many Frogs feeding in one poole togither, so light and nimble, that they would easely leape euery where, then he accused nature for creating him so slowe a beast, and for carying so great a burthen, that scarce he could stirre withal: But when he perceyued the Frogges to be deuoured of Snakes, and to be in daunger of euery trifle, he coforted him selfe saying: Oh how much better is it to cary a burthe, which may be a safegarde agaynst al weathers, than to be so oft in dauger of death? We must not be greeued with the gifts of nature, which are sometime more for our profite, than we can vnderstand. A riche man had two daughters, wherof the one died, at whose buriall he hyred women to lament: the other sayde: What wretches are wee, for to vs this mourning belongeth, but we can not skill thereof, and they which haue nothing to doo therewith, how pitifully doe they wayle? To whom hir mother sayde: Maruell not daughter, if they lament so, for they doe it bicause of money. Some men for loue of money feare not to picke aduauntage from an others miserie. A Nightingale sitting vppon a tree, dyd sing as he was wonte, but the Hauke seeing him and lacking meate, flew at the Nightingale, whiche being ready to be killed, besought the Hauke not to deuoure him, bicause she coulde not suffise to fill his belly, but he ought, lacking meate, to fall to greater birds. Nay (quod he) then were I mad, if I shoulde let goe that I am sure of, and pursue that I see not. Some men are so foolish, that vpon hope of greater things which are vncertaine, put away that they haue presently. A certein mad Man wandring through Cities, cryed aloud that he had wisdom to sell, then one offered money and required it, to whome he lent a blowe and gaue him a long threed, saying: Thou shalt be wise if thou keepe thee as farre from mad men, as this is long. We must haue nothing to do with mad men. A Priest gyuen to belly good cheere, deliuered to his Boy ten fat thrushes put vpon a Spit to be rosted, saying that he shoulde eate them all at a byt, if he lette them fall into the ashes. Within a short while after, when he returned (for he was gone out to doo certein businesse) he founde the boy crying, who being demaunded why he wept, aunswered, bicause he could eate but nine when they fell into the ashes, requesting that he might not be forced to eat the tenth bycause he was full swolne more than inough. The priest being offended, as well with the madnesse of the boye, as bycause he saw that he had lost his supper, led the boy without the thresholde of the doore, and shewed him three ways, saying: Choose which of these thou wilt, for here thou shalt not lodge this night. Wee ought not too keepe madde seruants in oure house. As a Foxe passed ouer a Riuer, hee was driuen into a ditche, where he stucke so fast in the mudde that he coulde not escape, whom the flies sore stinged. The Hedgehog seeing him there, tooke compassion on him, and asked him whether he shold driue the flyes from him: No (quod he) these are full with my bloud, and can little trouble me, but if thou shouldest driue them away, other huger sterued flies will occupie their roomes, and sucke out all the bloud that is left within me. Olde Magistrates must remayne in their office, An Asse bare great malice to a Hogge which dwelt with his maister, bicause he did nothing, & yet was fed with diuers kindes of meates and became dayly fatter, but he him selfe continually drudging dyd fare hardly, whereby he was so leane, that he could scarse goe. But at length when he sawe his fellow caried to the Butchers to be killed for mans meate, he somewhat reuiued and sayd: Ah, this is the end that me take such paynes in feeding a Hog. O how far better is it to be an Asse, than a Hog? We ought not to enuie those, whom we thinke happy, whereas that cloked felicitie, to many is cause of miserie. A certein yong man whiche should marie a Wife, being demaunded whyther he would haue hir, turned him to his frieds and neyghboures present, saying: Why stand ye lyke dumbe men, why doe ye not praye God to helpe mee this day? for if we praye God helpe them that nyse where no daunger is, how much more ought ye now to praye for mee, to whome so great daunger is at hand? They whiche marie, enter into great daunger. ye Snayle made slow hast, the cause whereof he maruelling at, asked him why he came not to the feast? he answered: My house is deare to mee and excellent: whereat Iupiter beeing angry, gaue sentence that he shoulde cary his house about him. Some men had rather liue hardly at home, than daintily abroade. The Foxe had so long tyme fasted without getting any maner of praye, that he looked very leane and thin, and by chaunce crept through a narrow hole, into a vault of corne, where when hee had well fed, hee assayed to go foorth ageine, but his belly being ful let him: the Wesill seeing him a far off struggling to get out, couselled him if he would get out, to come as fresh and fasting as he went in. This fable reherseth Horace thus:  Sometyme did passe a narrow hole, a hungrie Foxe and thin, To come vnto a vaulte of wheate where easly he got in: And being full, coulde not repasse, to whome a Weasill spake, Come fastyng foorth as in thou wentst, this way needes must thou take. An Apple tree mocked ye Oliue tree that he bare small beries, seing she brought foorth so great Aples, that hir boughs could hardly bear the: sodainly ther arose a wind, and all the Apples almost, bycause of their weyghte and vyolence of the tempest fell downe, and hir boughes were broken, but the Oliue tree stoode whole: then sayd shee to hir self, how far better had it bin for mee to haue borne lesser frute? Wee oughte to be contente with small things, seyng abundance of riches can not bee enioyed without great danger. The Flie striued with the Ant about his nobility, the Fly alleaged that she was of a noble bloud, and that she flyed, dwelts in Kings pallaces, fared deyntily, therevnto idelly atchieuing, and the Ant to be base born, to creepe on the earth, to liue in holes to gnaw on corne, and to drink water. The Ant replied that she was no base born, yet contented with hir birthe, the Flie to be a vagabund, hir selfe none, she tasted of corne and running water, the Fly of bakemeats and sweete wine, and she got not hir liuing ydelly, but with trauaile: furthermore the Ant to be always merry in safetie, beloued of all men, beside that an example of labor, the Flie to be in danger, hatred, and spited of all men, yea & a figure of slouthfulnesse: the Ant to be mindefull of Winter, and to lay vp this prouision, the Fly to liue from day to day, and in the winter to be hungry, or else die for hunger. A meane life, quietly out of checking, is better tha a delicate life in much trouble. A Husbandman wintered in the Countrey a good many dayes: at length he began to want his necessary things. Firste he began to kill his sheepe, after his gotes, last of all his Oxen, so keepe life and soule togither, bicause he was nighe pyned with hunger. The Dogs seeing that, determined to saue their lyues by running away, for they supposed in that he spared not his oxe, whiche for husbandry he occupied, that he would serue them with the like sause. Take heede in what house thou serue for hyre, some maisters are moste vncurteous, whiche in their rage care not what mischief or displeasure they doo to their seruaunts. The Lampurne on a tyme finding the broude of a Crocodile, killed them all,  & departed. When the Crocodile returned & found hir yong ones dead, she was out of measure sory, and desired by all meanes possible to reuenge their death, wherevpon she went armed to deuoure the Lampurn, but on a tyme shee found a cruell serpent and venomous, and she supposed it to be the Lampurn, who she assayled, saying: Ah wretche, nowe canst thou not escape, thou hast without cause slayn my sonnes, therfore now I wil dispatch thee: the snake aunswered, take heede of me, for I am no Lapurne but a venomous Uiper. Ah (quod the Crocodile) thou canst not deceyue mee, for thou art no Snake but a Lampurn, and altogither like to one, and therefore I will kill thee, but as she went to slaye him, the serpent prepared him selfe, byt hir, and also poysoned hir. No man ought to fight with him whom he knoweth not. It happened that a Lyon (wearied with running and heate of the weather) layde him downe to rest in the shadowe vnder the greene trees, who being sodenly waked with a flocke of Mise that ran ouer his backe, caught one amongst the rest. Thys poore prisoner besoughte him earnestly to set hym at libertie, saying that he was altogither vnworthy to stirre him to anger. The Lyon considering it wold be no commendation for him to slay so small a beast, let him go free. Not long after it chaunced as the Lyon ran through the thick wood, he fell into a net, well might he roare, but escape he coulde not: This Mouse hearyng the Lyon so lamentably roaryng, streighte way knewe his voyce, and crepte in at the holes of the earth, and diligently sought for the knots of the snare: which hauing foud, he gnew in pieces, by whiche meanes the Lyon escaped out of the net. Mighty men must vse mercy, for Fortune changing as the wynde, euen the shoutest at a tyme may neede helpe of ye basest: therfore a wise ma though it lay in his power to hurt any ma, ought to feare that, he that feareth not that, doteth greatly: and why so? Though it be so, ye bering thee bold of thine office thou carest for no ma, the day may come that thou maist be aferd. It is not vnknown what hath hapned to noble and mightie Princes, who haue not only bin glad to seeke ayde of most vile persons, but also haue feared their displeasure. As a Wolfe was drinking at the head of a spring, he espied a Lambe farre beneath also drinking of the same Spring, wherat grudging, ran hastily to the Labe and roughly rebuked him for troubling the spring. The Lambe al trembling besought him to shewe copassion on him, being therof giltlesse, alleaging that bycause he drank farre beneath him by no meanes he coulde trouble hys drinking, neyther yet ment it. The Wolfe hauing determined euen at the firste sight, the death of ye Labe, threatned hym moste rigorously, saying: Thy labor is in vayne to aske pardon, for thou art alwayes my enimie, thy Father, thy mother, and all thy cursed kinred are willingly my foes: but this daye I will be reuenged of thee. The mighty if he be disposed to hurt, easely findeth occasion thereto. A small thing is a great faulte, if a man deale with his Superiours. The Hares sometime assembled and bewayled their life as full of daunger and feare, that they were deuoured by men, dogs, and Eagles, and many other: whervpon they decreed that it was better once to die, than all their life to be in feare: then they rushed to the marsheward, as thoughe they would fall therein and be choked: but Frogs whiche sat on the banks, hearing a noyse of running, skipped into it. Whiche thing one of the Hares wyser than the rest seeing, sayd: stay fellowes  & do your selues no harme, for there are other beastes more fearfull than wee. Wretched men are comforted by the miserie of others being greater. A richman brought vp a Swanne and a Goose togither, but not both to one purpose, for the one shold serue to sing, the other for the table. When the tyme was come that the goose shold doe that for which he was kept vp, it chaunced to be night, so that one coulde not be knowen from the other, and the Swan was caried away in stead of the goose, who soong a song at ye beginning of hir death, by whiche she shewed hir nature,  & by hir sweete singing escaped death. Comonly Musicke prolongeth life. A certen ma bought a Moore, who thinking that the blacknesse of his skinne hapned through the negligence of his first Maister, tooke him home and ceassed not cotinually to washe him with suche things as would make him white, by which meanes he so vexed the poore slaue, that he brought him into a sicknesse, his skin remayning still as black as before. Nature will abyde as it was first. A horseman required a Husbandma to catch a Hare, whiche he looke in hys handes and asked the price, and foorthwith set spurs to his horsse: but the Husbandma sayd: Make no haste, for I will giue it thee for a present. This Fable toucheth those which refuse their own vpon necessitie. A certen man hauing forgot to shut the doore where the Hens roosted: When he arose in the morning, founde that they were all killed and caried away by ye Fox: He was wroth therefore with the Dog, bicause he had not well tended hys goods,  & bet him sore. Why, (quod he) if thou hast bin negliget in shutting the doore, for who the Hens layd egs, and hatched Chickens, is it any maruell if I being in a dead sleepe and haue no profit by the, did not perceyue the Foxe comming? We must neuer hope to haue diligent seruaunts, where the maister is negligent. A Fox durst not assaulte by night a flock of Hens for feare of a Dogge which he knew to lodge amongst them: but when he vnderstood that they were gone to an other place to companie with other Hens where no dog was, supposing to obtayn his purpose went thither and killed them all. It is better to haue a good and couragious neighboure dwelling neere, than cowardly kinsmen. When war was proclaimed betwene foure footed beastes, and foules: The Beastes made a league with the Fishes, that by their ayde they might be defended from the rigorousnesse of the Foules. Whe they looked for helpe at their hands, the Fishes sent their Ambassadoures to declare that they could not come by lande vnto the. Make not those thy fellowes, which can not helpe in tyme of neede. There was a Souldiour whiche hadde a passing fine horse, and bought an other in goodnesse nothing like vnto him, whom more nicely he kept than the firste: Then sayd he to his fellow, why doth my Maister keepe me passingly aboue thee, seeing I am not to be compared to thee, neyther in colinesse, strength, nor swiftnesse? He answered him: This is the course of the worlde, that new guestes are best welcome. Suche is the madnesse of men, that they preferre newe things afore old, though they be worser. A Gote going abroade to feed, shut vp hir yong Kid at home, charging him not to open the doore till hir returne: The Wolf by chaunce hearing that, after hir departure knocked at ye doore, fayning the voyce of the Gote, and bad him open it. The Kid perceyuing his pretence, denied to open the doore, saying: Though thy voyce be like a Gotes, yet I see a Wolfe throughe the chinkes. It is good for childre to obey their Parents, yong men to be ruled by age. A hen hauing many chickens did greatly feare least the Kight should catch the, wherevpon when she sawe the Kight, she gathered them often vnder hir wings to saue them from their enimie. But one day espying the kight flying toward hir, she called hir chickens togither, which al came quickly at their dames clocking, onely one excepted, which despising hir calling, whyles she coueted to eate a corne of wheat, was snatched vp in the clawes of the cruel Kight into the Aire. They whiche obey not their Parents comaundement, fall into miserie. A Philosopher of the secte of Cynicus in chyding being stricken, was not onely therwith cotented, but also rewarded him that strake, with a piece of siluer: Whiche thing whe all that were present maruelled at,  & sayd that he was worthy to be beaten ageyn, ah (quod hee) ye knowe not what I haue done now, but herafter ye shal know: not long after as that stryker would haue beaten an other (for he hoped to gayn somwhat) he receyued his deaths wounde, and feeling death to come vppon him, he sayd: how much better had it bin for me to haue bin striken again of the Philosopher, than to be rewarded with a siluer peny? When offenders scape scot free, it doth the somtime more hurte tha punishment. On a tim a yong Fox wandring fro hir hole, was snatched vp by an Eagle, the he cried for his Dame to haue ayde of hir: She hearing hir yong one crie out, came hastily running and besought the Eagle to set him at libertie: The Eagle hauing got that praie, would not departe withall, but caried it vp to hir nest. The Foxe desirous to be reuenged, caught vp a firebrand, following after him to sette fire on his nest: when she had climbed vp into the tree, she sayd to him: Saue thee and thy chickens if thou cast. The Egle fearing to be burnt, prayed hir to take pitie of him and his litle ones, and what soeuer he hadde of his, he would restore. By the Eagle is vnderstoode the mighty and men of stout courage. By ye Foxe the poore, whom the riche are earnestly bet with forged crimes to charge and slaunder: yet the Antes, when their anger taketh effecte, though they be a weake people, sometyme their iniurie wreakes very well. An Oliue tree maruelled yt a wild Uine which grew neere vnto him, had shooted vp so high in so short time, that he was far higher than hee which had continued many yeeres in one place: but winter coming on, the wild vine withered away. Then the Oliue sayde: We ought not enuie those things that shoote vp apace, whose ende is so soone at hand. Things soon ripe, are soone rotten. A flocke of Myse had their abiding in a hollow wall, whereout by chaunce peeping, they espied a Catte, whiche satte in a chaumber lookyng grimly, and hangyng downe hir head. Then sayde one of them: This beaste seemeth very gentle and simple, for hir countenaunce pretendeth holynesse, I will therfore go speake with hir, & contract a perfect league of friendship with hir that shal neuer be broken. Whe he had so sayd, he came nerer vnto hir, whom the Catte caught and tore in pieces: the other seeing that, sayd: Uerily, verily, wee must not credit smooth lookes. Wee must not iudge any man by his countenaunce, but by his good woorkes: for in a sheepes skin oft are wrapped rauening wolues. The Kyght contended wyth the Hauke before the Egle aboute his excellencie, alledging that for the greatnesse of his bodie hee ought to be preferred. The Hauke ageyne sayde, that the stature ought not to be considered, but the strength. Then the Egle sayd, Goe ye on hunting,  & whyther of you shall bring me the worthier praie, I will iudge him chiefest: but when the kight had brought a litle mouse, the Hauk a pigeon, the Eagle sayd: How much bigger the doue is than the mouse, so muche I declare thee Hauke to excell the Kight. Men must be iudged by their valiaunt actes, not their huge stature. A certen man hauing Cocks at home, bought a Partriche, whom he put with them to feed, but she being beaten  & driuen from their company was very sory, supposing that for being a stranger she was thus handled: but seing them shortly after fight one with an other, she left off sorrowe and sayd: Hereafter, if I see them fighting, I will not be greeued. Wise men paciently suffer wrog of straungers, perceyuing that they abstayne not from their natiue Countrymen. A Sowe mocked a Spaniell, bycause he vsed to faune on his maister, whiche so oft had beaten him, and plucked him by the eares, to teache him to hunte. Thou madde body (quod the Dogge) thou knowest not what I haue gayned by these stripes, for hereby doe I eate the sweete Partriches  & Quayles. We must not be greeued if our Maister beate vs, for thereof issueth plentyfull goodnesse. A Lamb standing in an highe place, rayled on the Wolfe as he passed by beneath, calling him naughty beast and rauening: to whom the Wolf turning sayd: Thou doest not taunte me, but the toure whereon thou standest. Some suffer wrong of vile persons, for feare of greater men. A Flye by chaunce fell into a fleshe pot, wherein being nighe choked, sayd to himselfe, beholde I haue eate and dronk so much, and so wel washed me, that now being so full I am content to dye. A wise man will stoutely beare out that which by no meanes can bee auoyded. The Wolfe and the Lyon being entred frendship together, did seek their liuing: when the Wolfe heard the baying of sheep, hee sayde: Truste to it friende, wee shall haue meate anone: When he therfore by folowing the noyse of Sheepe, was come to the penne, he founde it well fensed, and the Dogs neere a sleepe: Then he returned to the Lyon, saying: It pleaseth me not that at this tyme wee eate of sheepe, for they are very leane, let them growe fatte, and wee will returne when they be fat. The Fable noteth those, which being lette of their purpose, doo alleage that they would not. The report is, that if the Ape chaunce to haue a twinne, shee loueth the one, and hateth the other: It came to passe, that she had two at a clap, who by chaunce beeing put in feare, bicause she would escape the present daunger, carried that she loued in hir armes, which as she ran headlong, she dashed ageynst a rock, and slue it, the other whiche she hated, sat on hir rough backe, and went scot froe. It chaunceth commonly that parents bring that chyld to naught whom they make wanton, & whome lesse they cocker, to proue a valiant & good man. It was talked sometyme amongest the Popes Secretaries, that those men whiche framed their lyfe after the opinion of the common people, were in a myserable bondage, bycause it was impossible to please euery one, seing they are of sundry iudgements. To whiche opinion one told, that there was an olde man whiche went to market, with his sonne to sell an Asse, whiche he draue vnladen before him. As he passed on his way, there were men labouring by in the fields, which blamed the old man, bycause that neither he nor his sonne did ryde on the Asse whiche went empty, seeing the one for his age, the other for hys infancie had neede to be caried. Then the old man set his sonne on the Asse and him self went by on foote, which thing other seeing, sayd that he doted for letting his sonne ryde whiche was stronger, and hee being old woulde followe on foote: forthwith he chaunged his minde and set off his sonne  & ryd him selfe. When he had ridden a litle further, other met him, who blamed him, yt he had no regard to the age of his litle son, but would let him follow him as a drudge, and him selfe being his Father did ride on the Asse: wherewith he being moued, setle his sonne also on the Asse. Not long after he was asked by other, whose ye Asse was: Mary (quod hee) it is myne: then they rebuked him that he had no pitie on his poore Asse, but to set two on him, seeing one was sufficient. Then the man being troubled with so sundry opinions, & seeing he coulde not be in quiet, but still was checked, he bound the foure Asses feete togither, and on a staff caried him on his owne shoulders & his sonnes to market: whereat all men wondring, laughed exceedingly, blaming both their follies, especially the Fathers. The old ma there with chafed, went to the riuers side and cast his Asse bounde into the water and so lost him and returned home: by which meanes the silly old man desirous to content euery body, coulde please none, but lost his Asse. The Lion made a sumptuous banket to all other brute beasts, wherein Hens & Thrushes and such like birds were dressed, some rosted, some sodde. This feast pleased very well the dog & the Cat and other beastes that deuoure flesh, but the rest whatsoeuer feede on grasse and barley, iudged this feast as vnsauerie. It is harde to content the diuers opinions & fantasie of ye comon people. Plantin is an hearbe profitable to heale a quartain, whereof an Ape hearing, which hadde a Sonne vexed with that disease and coulde not be cured thoughe she had spent much vpo Phisitians, came vnto one Macer and sayd: I haue wandred far & nere, and can fynd no helpe for my sonne, but now I haue found thee whom I know to be a greate phisitian: therefore giue mee thy counsell, that I may get help for my son of the quarterne. Then Macer bycause he woulde bee iustified therin, sayd: Take foure roots of Plantine, and giue them the pacient and he shal soone be cured: the Ape hearing that, prepared the medicine which he ministred, and therwith healed him. Let vs seeke out a lerned phisitia if we woulde be restored to health. The report was somtime, that the Firre tree despysed the Bushes, and boasted of his owne tall stature, that he was placed in houses, and too beare a sayle in the ships: but the Bushes to be low, vile and good for nothing: then they framed him this answer: thou boastest much (O Firre tree) of thy goodnesse, and skornest our euils, besides this thou concealest thy mischief, and passest ouer oure good fortune, but when thou shalt be cut downe with the axe, how gladly woldest thou be like vnto vs which are voyde of care? Felicitie hath euils to accopany hir, as misery hath good things. In sume, this is safe and voyd of care, the other is neuer out of feare nor voyd of daunger. The Sowe and the Bitch contended about their nobilitie: The Bitch alleaged that of all foure footed beastes she was the fruitfullest. The Sowe quickly replied saying: Seeing thou sayst so, knowe thou, that thy whelpes be borne blinde? Things are not iudged by quick speede, but by full perfection. When the Dog fauned on his Lord or the seruaunte, they stroked him with their hands and made much of him: which thing the Asse marking well sighed deeply, being weary of his estate, yea  & he thought it vniustly appointed that the Dog should so be beloued of all men, as to be fed at his maisters table, and therevnto to attayne with ease and playe: contrarywise, himself to cary packs, to be whipped, to labour without ceassing, and yet neuerthelesse to be hated of all men: Seeing these things come to passe by fauning, he purposed to followe that trade of liuing being so profitable: and watching a conuenient time, when his Lorde returned home, bicause he would put the thing in triall, he ran afore to meete him: incontinently he lept on him and knocked at him with his heeles. Then his maister cried out for help, which thing his seruaunts hearing, ranne speedily to him: & the foolish Asse whiche thought him selfe ciuill and curteous, was well beaten with a staffe. All men can not doe all things, neyther all things become all men. Let no man meddle aboue his capacitie, nor go about that, whiche he is most vntowardly in. A crooked Camel required horns of god, whom for his euill pretence, God mocked, and from thencefoorth cropped his eares, and made his head smaller, wherby he myght seeme altogether deformed. Wee oughte to require of GOD that which is seemely. An Oxe was offended, that Nature had giuen him strength withoute any defence, bicause he lacked weapons, whiche he thought better than strength: he therefore besought Iupiter that he would vouchsafe to giue him horns, which when he had obtained, he forthwith repented him of his petition: For afore beeing naked, hee was free, and could be caught by none, but now that he had horns, he was caught in a snare and ledde to Ploughe, and compelled to great paines. Wee must aske nothing of God, but that wee vnderstand will do vs good. The Weasil through age lacking strengthe, and not able to hunte the Mise as he was wonte, he therefore to practise some shift, hid himself in a heape of meale, thinking therby easily to catche them: the Myse greedie of the meale, ranne into it, and were all deuoured by the Weasill. Where thou canste doo no good with a Lyons skin on thy backe, put on a Foxes skinne. A Crowe being thirsty, found a Pitcher of water, whiche bycause it was deeper than he coulde well reache, he assayed to poure out the water, but he could not preuayle, then gathered hee stones on the sande, which he cast in, whereby the water was raysed higher, and he drank thereof. Sometime that whiche can not be done by strength, may be by pollicie and counsell. A Lion being taken in a snare, endeuoured with all hys force to breake the bandes: the harder he plucked, the straighter he was helde. The Foxe hauing an errande that way, and seeing this, sayde: O King, by no strength mayest thou escape hence, but by pollicie, for the snare must be lette out and loosed, and not drawen in. Which whe the Lion had done, he straightway loosed the snare wherewith he was bound, and escaped free. Pollicie is farre better than strength. A Wolfe in hys olde age not able any more to hunte, was sore a hungred, neither could he finde any kinsman or friende which would helpe him with meate. As he therefore wandred throughe a great Woode heauyly, he chaunced vpon a dead carcase of an Oxe, whiche he had scarse begonne to teare, but a companie of other wolues, rauens, and crowes came thither  & prayed him to receyue them as hys friends to partake of his praie: Then the Wolfe sayd to him selfe: behold me whome lately my brethre and sonnes regarded not, now straunge beastes reuerence, and desire my friendship, but they doe not this honour to mee, but to the Oxe. A poore man is hated of all men, but the rich are honoured. The Horsse kept warre with the Harte, and being often driuen from his meate and put to the worste, he lamentably desired the ayde of men, with whome he came into the fielde: then he that afore hadde the ouerthrow, became coqueror: but his enimie being ouer come, and subdued, he him selfe became bond too man, fayne too carye him on his back, and a bit in his mouth. Of this fable writeth Horace .  A Hart in fight excelling much the horsse, from meate him draue, The strife was long, but horse was fayn, the help of man to craue. The byt he tooke with merry cheere, straight vanquisht was his foe, His Ryder yet he durst not cast, nor yet his byt forgoe, So he that dreadeth pouertie, and can not vse a meane, Shall leade his life in seruitude, and loose his freedom cleane. The Geese and the Cranes destroyed a peece of grounde, whereof the country men hearing, came sodainly vppon them, the Cranes espied them and flewe away, but the geese, bycause of the myght of their body not able to escape were taken. When a towne is woonne, the poore escape easily, but the rich are taken captiue: for riches in warfare, are rather a burthen, than a commoditie. before him, that he mighte giue iudgement whose ofspring were the best fauored: ye beasts came running, the birds flying, and the Fishes swymming thither. Laste of all came the Ape, and with him his yong one, at whose ylfauoured buttockes euery one laughed. Tush (quod the Ape) whom pleaseth God Iupiter shall haue the victorie, yet in my iudgement this my chyld is faire, and therfore of right before al other to be preferred: whereat Iupiter also smyled. We & ours seeme good in our own eies, but of vs & our doings, let other iudge. It hapned as many Maryners were sayling on the sea, that there arose a greate tempest sodeinly: then euery one prayed to his God for helpe, but one amongst the rest sayde: Ye know not what ye pray, for before these gods can goe to the Lorde for oure succoure, wee shall perishe thorough this storme: therefore I do thinke it beste to pray vnto that God which withoute the helpe of any other can deliuer vs from this present daunger: Then they cried to almighty God for helpe, and straightway the storme ceased. We must not seeke for helpe at the foote, when we may go to the head. In the assemblie of birds, the Eagle sayde that he would choose the yong ones of other birds to serue in his court: and when euery one stroue to preferre his owne, the Owle sayd: I pray thee (O Queene) receiue myne, which in beautie passe all the reste: why (quod the Egle) what beauty are thy sonnes of? The Owle aunswered: Of the same that I my selfe am: Then all the birds laughed exceedingly. No child is so deformed, which to his parents seemeth not faire. A Fox being coursed by a Dog, and euen at ye point to be caught, hauing no way to shift him sayd: why woldest thou destroy mee thou dog, seeing my flesh thou canst not eate? Goe catch rather that hare (for there was one the hard by) whose flesh me iudge to be ye sweetest: the dog harkned to ye counsell of the Fox,  & let him goe free, pursuing the hare, whom bycause of hys wonderfull swiftnesse he could not ouertake. Not long after, the Hare mette with the Foxe, blaming him for setting the Dog at him. The Fox answered him: I maruell what thou meanest to accuse me, whiche praysed thee so greatly: what wouldest thou haue sayd, if I had dispraysed thee? Many vnder the colour of praysing, deuise vtter vndoing to some men. On a time the Wolf being hungry had a good fansy to deuoure a Porkupine, whom bicause of his sharpe pricks he durst not assayle, but inuented a craftie wyle to trap him in, couselling hym not to trouble his backe with so many weapons in tyme of peace, seeing that other Archers carried none with them but when they go to warfare: Nay (quod the Porkupine) we must suppose that there is no tyme voide of war ageinst a Wolfe. A wise man ought always to be armed ageinst ye assaults of his enimies. A certeine olde man desired death which came to take his lyfe from him, to spare him till he might make his will, and prouide all other necessaries fit for suche a iorney: whom Death aunswered: Why hast not thou prepared thy self being so oft warned by me? Mary (quod he) I neuer sawe thee afore? Why (quod Death) when I dayly tooke, not onely those whiche were of lyke yeares to thyne (of which number very fewe remayne) but also yong men, children and babes, was it not sufficient warning that thou art mortal? when thy eyes waxed dimme, thy hearing thick, other senses dayly decaying,  & thy body being woorse and woorse, did I not tell thee that I was neere at hand? and yet thou sayest thou hast no warnyng: wherefore I will no longer prolong the tyme. We must direct our life, as though death were alwayes before our eyes. A certeine man brought vp his Dog in hunting, whome bycause hee was olde he pricked forward, but in vayne it was, for his pace was slacked, he could make no great hast. It chauced that he caught a wild beast, which bycause he was toothlesse, slipped from him, whom his maister rebuked muche for that fault, and bet him also: the Dog aunswered, that of ryght he ought to pardon him, bycause he was now olde, but when he was yong he did his endeuor couragiously: but I perceiue sayd he, that with out profite nothing pleaseth you, when I was yong and lustie, thou madest much of me, but now that I am old, thou castest me off for Hauks meate: when I got any pray I was welcome, but now that I am slow and toothlesse, I am put back: but if thou were a good master, for my good deeds that I haue done, thou wouldest cherishe me in my age. A good turn once past is soone forgotten, if it be to come it is not much regarded, if there bee any profit presently, it is well remembred. A certeine man rayled ageinst a hedge, wherewith his vyne was enclosed, bycause it was barren, which he cut vp  & cast away as a thing vnprofitable. Then the Uyne lying ope, & made common both for men & cattaile, was wasted by euery body. The Lord of the Uine seing this, blamed hym selfe of follie, seyng so foolishly he had remoued the hedge ye preserued his grapes. They whiche preserue thinges, though they seeme ydle, do no lesse than they whiche haue gathered them togyther with their trauaile. The Cock sometyme fed with an Asse, to who as the Lion was coming, ye Cocke crowed out aloude, and the Lion straightway fled (for men saye) he is afeard at the crowyng of a Cocke. The Asse supposing that he ranne away bicause of hym, went streyght after the Lyon, whome when hee had so farre pursued that they were without the hearing of the Cocks crowing, the Lion returned and deuoured him, who as he was dying, cryed out: Ah wretche and madde body that I am, for I am borne of none that were warriors, and wherefore haue I rushed into the hoste? Many men assaile their enimies which vpon set purpose do humble them selues, by the whyche meanes they are slayne. As two Cocks fought together for the Hens, the one put the other to flyghte, which hid him selfe in a darke corner: But the coqueror flew vp to an high wall, wher he stoode and crowed aloude: forthwith an Egle flewe at hym and caught hym: since which time, he that hid himself did treade the Hens without feare. God withstandeth the proude, but on ye lowly he poureth his goodnesse. Sometyme a Horsse decked wyth fayre trappers and a sadle, greatly neyghing, ran thorough a hygh way, whose running an Asse laden by chaunce dyd let, he all raging and chewyng his bit for anger, sayd: Ah lither lurdeyn, why withstandest thou the Horse? Giue place or I will tread thee downe: the Asse durste not once bray, but quietly auoyded. It happened as the Horse ran his race, his hoofe brake, who then being paste running or making any shewe, was spoyled of his ornamentes, and after solde to a Tanner. The Asse seeing him coming with a Tanner, sayde vnto him: What good sir, how hapneth this kynde of weede? where is thy gilt saddle, thy studded trappers and glittering brydle? Thus it is fit my friende to happen to euery one that is proude. Many men in their prosperity are so puft vp with pride, that they clean forget them selues and al modestie, but for their presumption they soone suffer aduersitie. perfectly, he sayd to himself: I am as faire and great as the Egle, I will therefore flie vp to the Sun, and looke vppon it as stedfastly as the Egle, and after I shal be esteemed as highly as she: but as he mounted vp toward the starres, his strengthe was gone thorough wearinesse, neyther could he flie vp to the Sun: yet such was his pride, that he would not come downe, but began to mount vpward still. But being thus combred, that be neither coulde stay himselfe, neither flie to the sunne, he fell downe. Who so clymbeth higher than he should, falleth lower than he would. On a tyme Iupiter myndyng too create a king of the foules, appoynted a day of assemblie, to the ende that hee whiche was comliest shold be appoynted king. The Rauen hearing therof, and knowing his owne deformitie, gathered together diuers feathers and decked himself, that he was goodlyest of all. When the day appoynted was come, the foules assembled together: then Iupiter would haue made the Rauen king bycause of his gaynesse, whereat the other disdayning, plucked euery one his feathers from him, whereof he being spoiled was a Rauen as before time. He that hangeth on another mans sleeue, if he chaunce to fall from him, all the world shall know what he is. The Flea came to the Lyon and sayde: Neyther feare I thee, neither arte thou stronger than I, but I pray thee what is thy strength? thou scratchest with thy nayles, and with thy teethe thou bytest, so doeth a woman fyghting wyth hir husband: but in strength I farre exceede thee, and if thou wilt, let vs go fight. The Trumpet being blowen, the Flea stucke faste aboute his nosethrills byting: but the Lyon with hys owne nayles tore him selfe til he was chafed: The Flea hauing ouercome the Lion sounded the Trumpet, and reioyced: but as he flew away, he was entangled in a Copweb: and being redy to be deuoured, he lamented that hee stroue with the greatest beasts,  & now to bee kild by a vile Spyder. This fable is ageinst those which vanquishe greate men, and are vanquished by meane persons. When the birds woulde make them a king, ye Pecock prayd them to choose him for his beautie: when they so mynded, the Chough began to say: if in thy raigne ye Egle pursue vs, how wilt thou help vs? Princes must be chosen not onely for their beautie, but also for their strength and wisedome. A certein man prepared a supper, to whiche hee hadde certein of his friends, whose Dog likewise desired another Dog, saying: Friend, come and suppe with mee. Which Dog being come in at the doores, & seeing such great cheere toward, reioyced greatly and sayd to him self: Oh what ioye hath hapned mee of late, for I shall fill my belly so full, that I shall not be hungry to morrow: and as he wagged his tayle for ioye, bicause he trusted in hys friende, the Cooke seing him thus do, caught him by the legs and cast him out of the window: whe the Dog was fallen, he rose vp quickly and ran howling away: As he went a dog met him, and asked him what good cheere he had to supper, the dogge aunswered: I was so out of measure dronk, that I knew not the way whereout I came. We must not trust to those which promise vs a good turne of an other mans gifte. As a Heardman kept a Heard of Buls, he lost a Calf, whom in euery desert he sought a long tyme, but when he could not finde him, he prayed to Iupiter , promising if he would shewe hym the Theefe whiche stole his Calfe, to offer a Gote in sacrifice to him. It hapned as he walked in a groue of Okes, he found that his calf was deuoured by the Lion, whereat trembling for feare, he cast vp his handes to heauen and sayd: God Iupiter I promised to giue thee a kid if I found ye Theefe, now if I escape his hands, I wil vndertake to giue thee a Bul. This Fable is against vnluckie men, that lacking ought, praye to finde it, whiche hauing founde, they seeke to auoyde. What time the Lion fell sick, al beasts came to visite him, only the Fox slacked his comming, to whome the Lion sent his Ambassadours to summon him to appere before him, bicause his only presence would much delight the king, besides that, suspicion of daunger there is none, firste, bicause the Lion is his chiefest friend, therfore desireth greatly to speake with him: againe, he lay sore sick, so as if he ment to hurte him, he hadde no force thereto. The Fox wrote again, wishing recouerie of his health, for which he woulde praye vnto the Gods, but in no wise he would come to see him: for he was afrayde of the foote steps, whiche all looked toward his Denne, but none backward, by which it was euidet, ye many beasts came in, but none returned.  3 The aunswer of the crafty Fox vnto the Lion sent, Which in his Den lay very sick, to shew is my intent: Bycause the tract of many beasts I finde to enter there, But none of them returns agayne, which giues me cause of feare. Take heed how thou trustest promises, whiche except thou doo, thou shalt oft be beguyled: for of words, & deedes a man may first coniecture & after iudge. A certein merry conceyted fellowe, hearing his friend to be created Cardinal, came to greete him for his promotion: he lofty  & swelling with pride, couterfayting that he knewe not his olde friende, asked who he was: the other being ready in his merry aunswer, sayde: I pitie thee and others that come to suche promotion, for as soone as ye haue got suche honours, ye leese so your sight, feeling and other senses, that ye cleane forget your old friendes. Some being promoted to dignitie, despise their old acquaintaunce. The Foxe and the Gote beyng bothe thirsty, descended into a Well to drink: after they hadde bothe dronk their fill, the Gote looked round about to get out, to who the Foxe sayd: Be of good chere, for I haue found a shift to help vs both out, for if thou wilt stand vpright  & leane on thy forfeete, and pitch thy hornes fast to the Wall that I may climbe vp on thy backe, when I haue got foorth, I will also drawe thee foorth: The Gote with all his harte followed his aduise. When the Fox therby had skipped out of the well, he iested about the brinks thereof, reioysing much, for whiche he blamed the Fox that hee broken promis with him. Nay (quod the Foxe) if thou hadst as much witte as thou hast haires in thy heard, thou wouldest not haue gone downe into the Well before thou haddest well pondered how to come out. Wise men will firste forsee the ende of a thing, and after enterprise it. A flocke of Fielde Mise appointed to gnawe downe an oke full of mast that they might haue their meate the redier, so as they neede not so oft runne vp and down for it. Then one wiser than the rest forbad the, saying: If we destroye our nourisher, who shall giue foode to vs and our seede in time to come? A wyse man ought not onely to beholde things present, but also things to come. As a Flea was byting a ma, he was taken, who asked what he was, seeing he fed of him: aunswered, he was of that kind of beastes, which as nature ordeyned, liued by that meanes, praying him not to kill him, bycause he could not do muche harme, whereat the man laughed, saying: I will therfore the sooner kil thee, bicause it is not lawfull to hurt any, eyther muche or litle. We must not fauour the wicked, whither their trespas be small or great. A Sheepe sometime rayled on the Shepherd, bicause he could not be cotet with the milke that she gaue him for his foode  & his sones, but he did fliece him of his wooll. The shepherd offeded with this talke, lead hir Lambe to the slaughter: What (quod the sheepe) canst thou doo me any worse villanie? Yea (quod the sheperd) that I can, for I may slaye thee and cast thee out to be torne in pieces by Wolues & Dogs: then the sheepe durst not mutter, being afrayd of some further inconuenience. We ought not to be angry with God, if he suffer our goods and our children to be taken fro vs, seeing he is able more greeuously to punishe bothe the quicke and the dead. Two Frogs fed in the marishes, it hapned that Sommer that the water dried vp, wherevpon they forsoke it and sought another, at length they found a deepe well: which when they hadde seene, the one sayd to the other: Lette vs goe downe into this Well. Nay, soft (quod his fellowe) howe shall we get vp again, if the water be dried vp here? We ought to enterprise nothing vnaduisedly. A certein Fisher being but a noouice in that arte, tooke his pypes and his nets and went to the Sea, and standing on a rocke, played first with his pype, supposing that by his sweete melodie the fishes would daunce: but when he had long tryed ye way and could not prosper, he layde downe his pype and tooke vp his net, which he cast into the Sea, wherin he drewe many fishes. When he had emptied his nette and sawe them skipping, he sayd: Oh wicked Creatures, when I piped, ye would not daunce, & now that I haue left off, ye begin to skip. This fable is against those which do any thing without aduisement, and out of tyme. In the assemblie of brute beastes, the Ape daunced, for which he was created King. The Foxe enuying him, brought him to a place where he had espied fleshe in a snare, to whom he shewed that he hadde founde a treasure which he coulde not haue bycause by the lawe it is the kings right, willing him to take it bycause he was king. The Ape went rashly in, and forthwith was caught in the snare: Then he accused the Foxe of treason toward his person. Why (quod the Foxe) shalt thou be King ouer beastes, which art so mad? Hee which goeth rashly to worke, falleth hastely into misfortune. A doue being very thirsty, espied in a certeine place a pot of water painted, which he supposing to be verely, flew with great force, and vnawares dashed against the table, wherewith she brake hir wings, fell to the grounde, and was caught vp by one that passed by. Some men for great ioye, vnaduisedly taking matters in hand, do therby cast them selues away. On a time a Currier came to a Hunter to bye a beares skin, for which he drew money to haue paid. In faith (quod the hunter) presently I haue none, but to morrow I wil go a hunting, and if I chaunce to kil a Beare, thou shalt haue his skinne. The Currier (to refresh his spirites) went into the forest with him, and bycause he would the better behold the pastime betwene the Hunter and the Beare, he climbed into an exceeding highe tree. The Huter went boldly to the Beares Denne, who, put in hys dogs and rouzed him. It happened that the Beare shunned hys blowe and foorthwith strake the Hunter to the grounde: who knowing the nature of the beast to bee, to take pitie of a carcase, helde his breath and fayned him self to be dead. The beare smelled at him euerywhere, & perceyuing by no meanes any life in him, departed away. When the Currier saw that the beast was gone, and that there was no daunger, he came downe out of ye tree and went to the Hunter, whom he bad arise, and afterward demaunded what the Beare sayde in hys eare? He warned mee (quod he) that hereafter I sell not a Beares skinne, before I haue caught him. We ought not accounte that we haue not, as sure as that we haue. The Beauer is a foure footed beast, commonly liuing in pooles, whose members Phisitians occupie: who beyng pursued  & ready to be taken, and knowing the cause of his persecution, cuts of hys priuie members, and casts it to them whiche followe him, whereby he escapeth. Wise men hauing regard of their health, ought to spare for no cost. The most parte of birdes were bidden to the Mariage of the Eagle, there the Houpe was set vp aboue the reste, bicause of his faire Crowne and goodly feathers, whereat the other birds disdayned, for that he vsed to tumble in dunghils and in the fylth. A great piece of Timber being caried in a Carte, rebuked the Oxen that they went so slowly, saying: Come for shame ye slouthfull luskes, your burden is but light. Thou mockest vs (quod the oxen) yet doest thou not knowe what hangeth ouer thy head: we will soone caste off this lode, but thou shalt beare a wayte till thou be ready to breake. Then the Beame repented, and from thence foorth durst not once shoote out a rayling word against them. Lette no man reioyce ouer an others miserie, seeing he may be subiecte to greater. The Lion sometime prepared to fight against the Bore: wherfore the Rauens beheld them from aboue, that they might forthwith deuoure him whiche was ouercome. But they became frieds again, & the other were disapointed of their purpose. We should not reioyce at an other mans harme. A Wolfe being old and not able any longer to hunte, gaue him selfe to religion: put vpon him a Monks attyre, and begged meate from doore to doore: and being rebuked by another Wolfe, sayde: What wouldest thou I should doe? My teeth are oute, and runne I can not, wherefore I mistrust otherwise how to liue. Many addict them selues to Religion bicause they ca not otherwyse liue. As a Beare scolded by chaunce with his Wife, he thrust out hir eyes, but after repeting, he was so greeued therwith, that he byt of his nayles. And when in talking he sayd, that for ye loue he bare to hir he had cast away his best defece: What good (quod his wife) doth this to mee? Thou shouldest haue done this before thou scratchedst out my eyes. After harme done it is too late to repent, seeing that which is done, can not be vndone. There was a Countryman which as he came fro market, heard two Cuckoes aunswering one an other out of two sundrie woods. And when the Cuckoe of the other wood had neere put to silence his countrycuckoe, he lighted off hys horsse  & climbed a tree, and as well as he could, he holpe his country cuckoe with his crying. In the meane time a Wolf deuoured his horsse: the was he fayn to go home on foote, where he complayned to his neighbours, how for the honour of his country he had holpe his Cuckoe, whereby he had susteyned great losse. Then they all with one accorde payd his damages, supposing that it was not fit that any should receyue hinderance, which had trauelled for their common wealth. A hare being pursued by an Eagle, ran into the hole of a Dorre, requiring succour of him. The Dorre besought the Eagle not to kill his suppliaunt, desiring him for mightie God Iupiters sake not to despise his weaknesse: but she being displeased, wafted at ye Dorre with hir wings, and snatched away the Hare, which she deuoured. The Dorre flew after the Eagle, to learn where hir nest was: When he was come at it, he rolled downe the egs  & brake them. She was sore displeased that any durst enterprise to do it: yet she made hir nest the second time in an higher tree, there the Dorre serued hir agayne as before. Then the Eagle being altogither in doubt what to do, flew vp to Iupiter to whom she is consecrated, and layde hir thirde brood in his lap, committing them to his custodie. But ye Dorre rolled togither a ball of dung whiche he caried vp and lette fall into Iupiters bosome, who rose vp to shake off the Dung, & forgetting the egs cast the downe, by meane wherof they were broke. When Iupiter vnderstood by the Dorre that he had done this to be reuenged of the Eagle, for she had not only iniuried the Dorre, but also committed wickednesse against Iupiter him selfe, he tolde the Eagle when she returned, that the Dorre was the cause of hir woe, and that he did it iustly. Therefore Iupiter , bicause he would not haue the kind of Eagles to be scant, counselled the Dorre to be at one with the Egle: but bycause he would not be persuaded, Iupiter appointed the Eagles to breade in that time, when the Dorres appeare not. Despise no ma, seing there is none but being prouoked can reuenge himself. The Strorke somtime built in the top of a Toure, & a Swallow with in, which for ioy that she had yong ones, made great chattering, where with the Storke was offended, bicause he could take no rest with his yong ones, for hir great noyse. Whe ye Swallow was abroade, he plucked down hir nest and killed hir yong, who being returned to hir nest, made great sorrowe for that mischaunce, but bicause she knew not the doer, she reueged it not. Shortly after, the Swallow made a new nest and hadde yong, for ioy of whom she agayn chattered. But the Storke being newly disquieted, called to hir, saying: I will serue thee and thy birdes agayne as lately I did, excepte thou leaue of thy chattering that I may take my rest. The Swallow hearing this, was greatly inflamed to be reueged: wherfore on a time when the Stork was a sleep in hir nest, the Swallow set fire thereon & burnt hir and hir chickens to ashes. We ought to doo no wrong to our inferiours least priuily they hurt vs. It pleased a town Mouse for his recreation to walke abroad into the coutry, who when the cuntry Mouse had espied, he desired him home to his house, where al things were made ready, and to supper they went: he brought out all his prouision of victuals that he had layd vp against the winter, to make this iolly gueste some dai[ntl]y cheere. The towne Mouse frouning thereat, disalowed much the scarcitie of the Countrey, and forthwith commended the plentie of the Citie. As he returned to the Citie, he brought with him the country Mouse, to the ende to accomplishe his craking wyth effecte: They fell to their meate, whiche sumptuously the towne Mouse had ready prepared. And as they were merry togyther: in the midst of their feast they heard the noyse of a key in the locke, there was quaking and trembling with a great hurly burly, and happy was hee that could escape soonest. The country Mouse vnaccustomed to such flights, besides that ignorant of the place, scaped very narrowly. When the seruaunt was gone, the towne Mouse returned to the feast and called for the country Mouse: He being yet afrayd, came creeping out, and after desired by the Towne Mouse to fall to his meate, he asked, whyther this were a comon custome with him? Yea (quod hee) it is dayly, and therefore not to be wayed: What dayly? sayd the country Mouse. I promise you, these dainties tast more of the sowre than of the sweete: for my part I had rather liue like a begger quietly, than with these delicates in suche ieoperdie. Riches truly make a semblant of pleasure, but if thou consider them earnestly, they are not without much dauger and pensiuenesse. A Mule espied a Horsse gorgeously decked with a gilt byt, a faire sadle, & purple trappers, at whose Fortune he enuied much, supposing him to be happy, bicause he alwayes fared well, and went gayly: contrarywise, his owne estate in comparison of his to be miserable. For (quod hee) I am ouerlade with the packsadle, and I am dayly drudge to cary burthens. But shortly after, he espied the horsse returning from battaile sore wounded, then he accounted his owne estate better than the horses, saying: I hadde rather get my liuing hardly with my dayly labour, and to be cladde in vile aray, than after such faire and trim apparell to be in daunger of my life. We must not enuie Kings and Princes bicause of their wealth & substance, seeing they are subiecte to many moe perils than poore men are. A Deuil wadring through the world (as his maner is) marked a certeine yong man reioysing at the death of his parents, whereat he was very gladde: but going a litle further he wept, seeing an other very heauy at his Fathers buriall, who beyng demauded the cause of so diuers affections, aunswered: The laughing of the sonne for the death of his parets, declareth that these being riche are deade, of whiche number very fewe escape our handes: but the weeping is a token of the fathers pouertie: and the kingdome of Heauen, for the moste parte, is wont to belong to those whiche are poore. Too much riches do cary a man downe to hell. The Birds were greatly afrayd least the Dorres should kill them with shooting off Bals, bicause they heard that they had rolled togither a great heape of bals. Feare not sayd the Sparrow, for how shall they shoote bals at vs that flie in the aire, when they can not carry them on earth but with much toyle? We neede not feare the riches of our foes, when we see they lacke wit. An Oxe being well stryke in age, dayly went to plow. It hapned yt a yong heyfer whiche neuer had laboured, fetched his friskes in the pastures not farre off, and scorned the toyling of the elder, boasting much of his own libertie, that he had tasted neither yoke nor chayn, but ye others necke was worne bare with labor. The Oxe presently answered nothing: not long after he espied this royster led to be sacrificed, then hee sayd thus to him: What end hath now thy easy life? Thy carelesse liuing at harts ease hath brought thee to ye axe, I think now thou wilt rather counsel me to labor tha to idlenesse which is the cause of thy death. To leade an honest life there needeth trauell: the Sluggard and hee that is bent to riottous liuing, shall come to that which he would be lothe. The Birds tooke counsell to choose them sundrie Kings, bicause the Eagle alone was not able to gouerne so many flockes: which thing they had put in execution, had not the Crowe warned them to leaue off their purpose: who being demaunded the cause, why she thought it not meet to choose many Kings, aunswered: Sooner is one sack filled than many. It is better to bee vnder the dominion of one than many. A wicked Man went to Apollo whiche is in Delphus , to trie his cunning, for whiche purpose he tooke a Sparowe with him in his hande, which vnder his cloke he hidde: who as he stood neere to the golden table in Apollos temple, asked the GOD, saying: O Apollo , that which I holde in my hande, is it a liue or dead? If he hadde sayd dead, he would haue shewed the Sparow aliue: if aliue, he woulde haue strangled it and shewed it dead. But God Apollo knowing his wicked pretece, sayd: whither thou wilt, doo: for it is in thy power eyther to shewe him aliue or dead. God can not be deceyued, neyther is any thing hid from him. A Boye whiche hated learning, being brought by his Father into a Schoole, could not be enticed by any faire meanes of his Maister, to speake the first letter of the Alphabete: Then sayde his Maister, open thy mouth, for that this Letter requireth, but he gaped and spake not. The Maister seeing his labor lost, bad him sitte amongst his fellowes, warning them to persuade him to speake onely this Letter: then his schoolefellows exhorted him in the best maner that they coulde, saying: Is it such a payne to sayd A? Nay (quod the Boy) but if I spake that, he would make me learne B. and so the rest. But neyther my maister nor my Father shall haue the power to make me learne. They which are vnwilling to learne, can neuer be forced to it. A Doue being fed in a douehouse, was exceeding proude of hir fertilitie: The Crowe hearing thereof, sayd to hir: Friend, brag no more hereof, for the more thou breedest the more care thou heapest. Amongest seruaunts, those are most miserable, which in time of their bondage get many children. An Asse and a Calfe fed togither in one pasture, by chauce they heard the sound of a bell, which they supposed to be a signe that their enimies were at hand, to whom the Calfe sayde: Let vs be packing hence fellowe, least our enimies take vs prisoners. Nay, flie thou hence rather (quod the Asse) whom they vse to kill and eate, for I care not, I know this, where soeuer I become my life shall be to cary burdens. Let not seruaunts feare muche to chaunge their maisters, least the last be woorser than the first. A Bat by chaunce fell to the ground, and was caught by a Weasell, who ready to be killed, besought him to saue his life: but he sayd, that he could not let hir escape, bicause he naturally hated all birdes: she aunswered, yt she was no bird but a mouse, whereby she was loused. Again falling an other time  & being taken by an other Wesell, she prayed that he would not deuoure hir. Nay (quod hee) I am an enimie to all Mise: she aunswered that she was a Bat & no Mouse, whereby she escaped again: and so it chaunced that by changing hir name twice she got hir pardon. We must not always sing one song, seing they that turne as the world doeth, commonly escape daunger. It hapned amongst other talke that the Foxe had with the Cat, he bragged that hee had so sundrie kinds of shifts, yt hee could fil a bag withal. For my part (quod ye Cat) I haue but one to trust vnto at a pinche: As they were thus in their talke, a great route of Dogs came hastily running vpon them: Then the Cat skipped vp into an highe tree, but the Fox being inclosed with the dogs, was caught. One counsell so it be true and of force is better than many wyles. A certein prodigall fellowe hauing wasted all his Fathers goods, applied his minde to practise deceyte. It happened on a time, that he wrapped a piece of ordure in a cloute and brought it into the market, saying that he had a precious thing whiche was of suche force, that if any man tasted the least crumme therof, he shold haue fulfilled what soeuer he thought of. But a Iewe, whose maner is priuily to marke al things, thought, if he did buy it, that he would haue in his minde many Townes and Lordships, when he tasted of it (bycause he would be exceeding riche) He came therfore secretly vnto him and asked the price, whervnto this prodigall fellow sayd: Auaut, thou shalt not buy it, for thy clothes declare, that thou art not able. The Iewe sayd to him, how knowest thou? Tell mee the price, he aunswered .700. Crownes: the Iewe payd him the money, vpon codition, that if he had sayd true, he should enioye it: but when he had tasted it, he spit it out, and sayd it was ordure. Then the seller hauing performed his promise, pleaded the cause before the maior, and enioyed the money. A certein Carter asked his wagon, why that wheele which was worst made so much creaking, seeing none of the reste dyd so? The waggon aunswered: Sick folkes are wayward, and alwayes complayning. Diseases cause men to coplayne. Men commonly will (if through their follie any mischauce happen to them) laye the blame to Fortune or the Deuill, to excuse them selues, they doo so much follow their appetites: wherewith the Deuill not contented, when by chaunce he espied an olde woman climbing a tree, whece he perceyued she was like to fall, and then the faulte would be layde on his necke, he called for witnesses, to whom he sayd: Behold, that same old woma hath climbed that tree without my consent, where I see she will fall: beare witnesse therfore with me that I counselled hir not to goe vp. Immediatly she fell: then being demaunded why she climbed that tree, answered, the Deuil forced me: then he brought foorth his witnesses, and proued that she did that without his aduise. Those men deserue no pardon, which voluntarily sinning, blame Fortune or the Deuill therfore. On a solemne feastday the Eagle had ye birds to dinner: after it was done, the Egle called forth the Nightingale, whome he bad to sing some melodie to lighten their hartes withall. She forth with soong sweetly, that it delited the hearers. In the meane time a Rauen passing by and hearing this, sayd: I will also sing with ye Nightingale, for I haue a base voyce which shal be heard farre off, and hee began to crooke very lothsomely, which caused the Nightingale to hold hir peace. The other birds were offended with the Rauen for troubling ye feast: then the Egle commaunded him, eyther to departe or to hold his peace, but he answered that he would sing,  & for hir he would not stir an ynch. The Egle comaunded him again to auoyd, which bicause he stubbornly disobeyed, was comaunded to be slayn. It is vayne to sing, where the hearers are vnwilling. The Pie asked the Doue what was the cause that she alwayes built in one place where hir chickens were always taken away: she aunswered, simplicitie. Good men are easely beguyled. As an Asse laden with wood passed thorough a marshe, by chaunce he slipped and fell, who not being able to aryse, lameted  & sighed, but the Frogs which were in the marshe, hearing him sighing, sayde: What wouldst thou doo sirra, if thou hadst continued here so long as we haue, whiche for so small a time doest so mourne? This talke may any man vse to a slouthful person, which for a litle paynes is troubled, being able easely to ouercome great affaires. The Goose and the Duck made somtime a great feast, to the whiche they had all tame Foules, but to sette out their Supper, they went into the wildernesse and found the Pellican, whome they brought with them to their banket. Whe the feast was done, they all besought the Pellican to abide with them and not to liue so solitarily in suche penurie, who at length being somewhat persuaded, continued a few dayes with them and made great bankets: but when he would haue prayd, he was interrupted with their chattering: wherfore he left their company, and liued the rest of his life in solitarinesse. Who so will serue God truly, must doe it alone quietly. A certein Smith had a whelpe, whiche all the while he stroke on his yron, did slepe: but when he went to meate, the dog would straightway arise  & eate the crums that fell from the table, or bones, or any thing else. Whiche thing the Smith marking well, sayd to his Dog: Thou wretch, I ca not tell how to handle thee, for whiles I am busie in my worke, thou liest snorting and sleeping, but when my teeth goe, thou startest vp and waggest to mee thy tayle. Idle sluggardes which liue of an other mans sweate, must be punished according to the rigour of the law. A Mouse did byte a Bull by the foote, and straightway ran into his hole: the Bul shaked his hornes and sought for his enimie, but see him he could not: then ye mouse laughed him to scorne, saying: Bicause of thy stregth despise not euery body, for now a silly Mouse hath hurte thee,  & scaped free. Let no man regarde his enimie. A Weasell came into a Smiths shop,  & licked on a fyle which lay there, wherwith hir tong being torne, bled very much: She reioyced greatly, supposing to cary away something from the yron, vntill hir tong altogither was worne away. This fable is against those which in strife hurt themselues. The Hares sometime holding war with the Eagles, required ayde of the Foxes: but they aunswered, we would helpe you, but that we knowe what ye are, and with whom ye fight. They whiche striue with their betters, set litle by their owne health. There was a Ramme amongs many others which with stregth of his hornes and his head, at the first conflict easely subdued al the rest, whom bicause none durst meete (he had so often the victorie) he swelled with pride and chalenged the Bull to fight: but at the first onset when he rushed against the Buls forehead, he was stricken again so vehemetly, that he was nie dead, & then sayde: Ah foole, what haue I done? Why haue I prouoked so mighty an aduersarie, to whome nature hath made mee vnequall? We must not striue with our betters. The Quayle bicause of preseruation of his kinred, desired to haue a league of amitie with ye Gossehauke, wherfore he desired the Larke to make his commedations, and to require peace with him on his behalf. The Larke did the message honestly, wherwith the Gossehauke being troubled, aunswered: This request is hard to graut, neuerthelesse I will that the Quayle come with thee vnto mee and speake for hir self: The Larke shewed hir this aunswer, who much reioysing therof, went to the Hauke to confirme the league, who being rauished with the sight of them, forthwith deuoured them both. None ought to match him selfe with his better. A certeine Woman questioned with a Nut tree growing by the high way side, which was alwayes pelted with stones by passengers, why he was so mad, yt the more he were beaten, the more encrease he yelded, the Walnut aunswered: Remember you not the old Prouerbe? The Nut tree ye Asse,  & the Woma, are al vnder one law: which three will doo nothing well without great store of stripes. Some men make a rod oftentimes for their own tayle. A Beare sometime stinged of a Bee, was so wood angry thereat, that with hys nayles he tore in pieces the hyues where the Bees made hony: The Bees seing their hiues plucked down, their food caried away,  & their yong ones slayn: rushing al at once, assayled the Beare, and nighe stong him to death. He hardly scaping from them, sayde to himself: how much better had it bin for mee, paciently to haue suffered the stinging of one Bee, than to prouoke so many enimies against mee? Sometime it is farre better to suffer wrong done by one, than in requiting it to procure many foes. The Sowe and the Dog taunted eyther other: The Sowe swore by Venus , that without doubte she woulde teare the Dog in pieces: Hee aunswered hir againe flowtingly, saying: Ye sweare very well by Venus , for ye shewe that shee loueth you well, bicause that tasting thy filthy fleshe, she suffereth thee not at al to enter hir temple. The Sowe sayd: For this cause it appeareth that the Goddesse loueth mee the more, for him that either killeth or hurteth mee, she vtterly abhorreth: as for thee, eyther aliue or dead, thou sauourest yll. Wise Oratours cunningly conuert to their own prayse the tauntes of their enimies. A Boy stole his Fellowes Booke out of the Schoole, whiche he brought to his mother: but she corrected him not therefore, but rather made much of him: Who waxing elder, stole greater things: and at a time being taken with the manner, he was straightway led to execution, whome his mother followe and lamented: but he prayed the Hangman that he might talke a woorde or two in his mothers eare, who straightway layde hir eare to his mouth, which he with his teeth byt off: his mother and diuers others rebuked him that he had not only played the theefe, but also vsed villanie to his mother. She (sayde hee) is the cause of my vndoing: for if she had chastised me when I stoale the Booke, I had not now bin led to hanging. Faults which are not at the firste corrected, do increase greater. he stole his oxen in the countrey, and came to him in the likenesse of a man into the citie, and lodged with him. Tyresias vnderstanding his oxen to be lost, went abroade and tooke with him Mercurius , to consider by diuination of the theefe, whom he bad to tell him what birde he did see: he aunswered that he sawe an Eagle on the left hand, flying toward the right hande, he sayd that he had nothing to doo with hir. The seconde tyme Mercurius tolde him, that he sawe a Crowe sitting vpo a tree, sometime looking vp, sometime leaning downe, who as soone as he vnderstoode it, sayde: This Crowe sweareth by heauen and earth, that if thou wilt, I shall receyue my oxen. This kind of talke any ma may vse against a theefe. A Partriche sometime in the absence of an other bird, stale hir egs: who returning to hir nest and seeing it robbed, was full heauy, she went about seeking so long till at length she found them and the theef, whereof she shewed the Iudge, who cited the theefe, and craftily examined him therof: He vtterly denied it, wherof the Iudge could giue no sentence for lack of witnesse, but the accuser sayd to him: thou oughtest to torment him till he confesse the truthe. Nay (quod the Iudge) thou shalt proue that thou sayest, that I may iudge therof right, or else I will martyr thee with him. Then she bicause no profe was made, was tormented, and the fellony enquired off. In the ende the theefe declared al, and many other theftes whiche he had committed, whereof the Iudge commaunded to hang him vp out of hand. Who so accuseth any one, lette him first examin him self, whether he be of like faulte gyltie. The Hauke sometime mocked the Cuckoe, bicause that being as big bodied as hee, and in colour like him, for his faynte courage he did liue by wormes, and not by the sweete flesh of other birdes. Not long after, the Cuckoe espied the Hauke hang out of a high Toure, being caught in pursuing Pigeons, to whom he sayde: Howe farre better hadde it bin to haue hunted wormes, than other mens birds? Their life is safer, that being voyd of perill are content with their owne, tha these which by coueting other mens goods come in daunger. A certein Grammarian boasted that he was so passing fine in his arte, that if he might haue a sufficiet reward, he would take vpo him to teach not only childre, but also Asses. The Prince hearing of ye mans rashnesse asked him whither he thought he could teach an Asse within ten yeares, if he gaue him .50. Crownes. The shamelesse man aunswered, that he would not refuse to be slayne of him, if in that space the Asse could not write and reade. His friendes hearing of this, maruelled  & rebuked him, bicause he had promised to doe a thing, not only hard, but also impossible: & they did feare, least when the time had bin expired, he should be slayne of the King: whome he answered: Before this tyme be come out, either the Prince, the Asse or I will die. Delay of time is comonly wont to be a helpe, for those whiche stande in daunger. There was a certein man very riche and liberal, which had many friends whom often times he hadde bid to supper, to the which willingly they came, and bicause he might ye better know, whither they would be trustie in time of neede, he assembled the togither  & told them that he had foes lately vpstart, which he meaned to destroy, praying them therfore to arme themselues and come with him to reuege his quarell: then euery one began to excuse him selfe sauing two, which he accounted for his friendes, & afterward loued them dearely, but the other he reiected. The best trier of friendes is aduersitie. A certen old man espied a yong man gathering of his frute, whome he gently entreated to come downe from the tree, and not to purloyne his goods: but he spake to the winde, for he lightly regarded his age and his woords. Ah (quod the olde man) I haue hearde, that not onely in woordes, but also in herbes force consisteth, wherevpon he began to pluck the leaues and cast them at him. The yong man seeing him doe so, laughed out of measure, supposing that hee doted, to driue him downe with leaues. The olde man willing to assaye him by gentle meanes, when he perceyued that he coulde nothing preuayle, sayde: I will proue what stones will doo, for in them men saye, there is vertue: and forthwith filled his lap with stones which he caste at the yong ma, and perforce made him come downe and departe. A wise man ought to assaye all manner ways, before he take any weapon in hande. A Bull being afrayde of a Lyon, fledde away, and by chauce met with a Gote, who with frouning coutenaunce threatned to strike him with his hornes, to whome the Bull full of wrath, sayd: It is not the knitting of thy browes feareth mee, but yt the fierce Lion is so neere at my heeles, thou shouldest feele what it were to medle with a Bull, and to renew his wounde. To the sorowfull ought no more miserie be added, who that hath bin once in trouble, hath tasted sorrowe inough. A certeine Larke by chaunce builded hir nest in a piece of wheat, that was somwhat riper than other: whence hir yong ones were not able to flie when the corne was yellowe: As she was going foorth to seeke meat, she warned the if any noueltie hapned to be done or sayd, to marke it wel, and at hir returne to certifie hir thereof, after hir departure, the owner of the corne came thither, and sayd to a yong man hys sonne: Seest not thou, that this corne is rype and needeth labourers? to morrowe therfore by breake of the daye, goe to my friends, desire the to helpe me in wt my haruest: when he had so sayde, he departed. When the Larke returned to hir yong ones, they came fluttering about hir, and prayed hir out of hande to haste and carry them away: for the owner had sent to his friendes, willing them to come the nexte morning to reape his corne: She bad them be of good cheare and feare nothing, for if the Lorde of the ground haue remitted the matter to his friends, to morrowe it shall not be cut downe: The nexte day she flew abroade again for meate, the Lord wayted for his bidden friendes, the Sunne waxed hot, but nothing was done, neyther any friende of his came. Then sayde hee to his sonne, I see well that these my friendes for the most part are loyterers, let vs therfore entreate our kinsfolks and neyghbours to morrowe betimes to come: hir Chickens were then afrayd and tolde it to their mother: she bad them to leaue of feare  & care, for none of alliaunce would be so obedient as to come at a becke, especially to labour, take you heed only, if ought be sayd agayn. The nexte morning she went abroade as before, his kinsfolks left the work vndone: The owner seeing that, sayd to his sonne: Adieu both friendes and Cousins, bring thou to morrowe at the breake of the daye two sickles, one for mee, another for thee, & we with our owne handes will reape it. When hir yong ones told hir this, she said: It is time to be packing, for that he sayde without doubte shall come to passe: for on him that ought it, the labour is turned, not where it was required: and thus the Lark shifted hir nest, and the corne was reaped. Here of Ennius writeth these two Uerses:  This sentence in thy minde, beare thou in any wise: Looke for no helpe of friends, where thy helpe may suffise. A Foxe being taken in the snares of a Countryman, of whose Hens he hadde killed many, desired a Cock (of whom only he was seene) that he would eyther bring him a knife to cut the ginne, or else say nothing to his maister till he had gnawne it a sunder with his teeth. The Cocke promised both, went quickly to his maister & told him that the Foxe was fast in the snare, whome the Foxe espying to come with a club to kill him, sayd: Ah vnhappy wretch & foole that I am, which beleeued the Cocke would keepe my counsell, of whose wiues I haue killed so many. Neuer trust those, whome we haue greatly hurt. A certen poore man whiche had nothing but a barell of wine and an Asse, hadde maried his only daughter to a certein yong man, promising him somewhat in franke mariage, which he thought to gather of his wine and the Asse (for he had determined to sell them) but the next night after that the bridall was kept, the Asse died, who as he was dying, brake ye vessell with his heeles, and spilt the wine. We must put no trust in transitorie things. A certen Countryman playing the part of Christ in a playe, was beaten and euill entreated of the Iewes, wherfore he flong away the crosse and sayd: The Deuil be your God, for I wil not. Then a Baker tooke his part, whome the Iewes likewise did handle opprobriously: whiche thing the pacient suffered: but another sayde to him, Meale stealer: then the Baker aunswered, hold thy tong, or else I wil ouerthrow thee with my crosse. Truthe can abyde no gesting, neyther men that are giltie will willingly heare of any iesting of their dooings. A Harte beholding him selfe in a cleare water, allowed muche his faire forehead and broade hornes, but the smalnesse of his legs he condemned. As he was thus viewing and iudging, there came a Huter vpo him: the Hart fled away very swiftly, the Dogs pursued him: but being entred into a thick wood, his horns were wrapped faste in the boughes: then he praysed his legs and dispraysed his hornes, which caused him to be taken. Things whiche do hurte we doe hunte after, but good things we despise, we wishe for blyssednesse before wee know where it is: Riches and promotion we seeke for, wherin we think that felicitie doth consiste, but in the is much trauell and pensiuenesse. A Countrymans Carte stucke faste in a deepe mire: straight way he besought helpe of Hercules . To him an answer was giuen: Thou dolt whip on thy horsse, & lift thou forward thy wheeles, and then call on Hercules , and he will be ready at hand. Uayne requestes doo not auayle, which God wil not heare, helpe thy self, and then God will helpe forward. A certein man had a Dog whiche often times had byt many, whervpon he tyed a clog on his necke, that men might take heede of him. The Dog supposing that to be giuen him for a commendation of his courage, despised his companions: then one of them tolde him of his blindnesse, that he wore that clog with shame, and not with honour. A vaynglorious foole sometyme counteth that to be his prayse, which is vtterly to his shame. A Hog espied a barded Horse, which was set out to warfare well appointed, to whom he sayd: Whether makest thou such hast, thou foole, perhaps thou shalt be slayn in battaile: The horsse aunswered him, though thou doe nothing worthy of prayse, but being fat liest wallowing in the myre, yet a little knyfe thy lyfe shall dispatche, where as great renoume after my deathe I haue. It is better to die valiauntly, than to prolong thy life led wickedly. The Rauen enuied the Swanne for his whitenesse, whome with all pollicie he endeuoured to defile and make black: and bicause he could not work his will whiles the Swan waked, he practised it when she slept. Wherefore he came in a night the Swanne sleeping on hir nest, and with his blacknesse polluted hir  & made hir blacke. When day was vp and the Swanne awaked, she sawe hir selfe thus painted, she washed hir selfe continually, till she became faire. Who so will be blissed, lette him keepe him selfe vndefiled. A Thrush being caught with birdlyme of a Fouler, did torment hir selfe, saying: The pangs of death greeue me not so much, as that my owne things are my destruction: for men saye, that birdlime is made of Thrushes doung. Then are men most greeued, whe their own doings do slay them. A Lion sometime caught in a snare, was so entangled, that he could not winde out him selfe, wherevpon he desired the Mouse to gnawe a sunder the ginne, promising a recompence for his good turne. Which thing when the Mouse had quickly done, he required the Lion to giue him his daughter in mariage: the Lion (to requite his benefactor) graunted hir vnto him. When the new maried wife was come to hir Husbande, by chaunce not seeing him, trode on him, and burst him all to pieces. All mariages and matches vnequally made, are not to be allowed. A certeyne Ryuer checked hys headspring, as being a standing water, neyther hauing any fishes, but him self he highly commended, bycause he bred goodly Fishes, and pleasauntly ranne throughe the valleys. The head spring fretting at the vnthankfulnesse of the Ryuer, ceased his wonted course, whereby the Riuer wanting bothe hys Fishes and hys pleasaunt noyse, dried vp. Some claime as their owne, whatsoeuer they doe, robbing GOD of his honour, from whom al goodnesse doth proceede. A Serpent beyng ouerwhelmed with a great stone, desired a man that trauailled that way, to roll off the burden from hym, promising to gyue hym a great treasure if he would doo it. Whiche when the gentle fellow hadde done, the Serpent did not only breake his promisse, but also sayd the man was worthy to die. As they thus stroue, it happened that the Ape passed that way, who being chosen iudge betweene them, sayde: I can not ende so great stryfe betwene you, excepte I see firste howe the Serpent stood vnder the stone. When the man had layd the stone vpon the Serpent, he sayd: I thinke that vnthankfull beaste ought to remayne vnder the stone. Unthankfull men are worthy of no good turne. A certeyne man had a woodden Image, whom he prayed to bestow some benefite on him, but the more he prayed, the more he liued in pouertie: Where with he being angry, caught his Image by ye legs, and floong him agaynst a wall, wherewith his heade being broken, greate abundance of golde came out, whiche as he gathered, he sayd: thou art froward as I think, for whiles I did reuerence thee, thou didst mee no good, but when thou wast well beaten, thou hast yelded much riches. A naughty man will doe muche more good by beating than by honoring him. An Asse hauing a galled back, fedde in a medow, on whom a Rauen did sit and picked at his sore, whereat the Asse brayed and skipped: The horskeeper standing a far off, laughed thereat, whome as a Wolfe passing by espied, he sayd: Alas, if we poore wretches should doe so much, we should be pursued: but at him they laugh. Wicked men only peeping abroad are forthwith knowne. A certen rich man, much giuen to hunting, did keepe many dogs, wherof one bit his sonne, that he dyed: Their maister beeing wroth, comaunded to slay not only the man killer, but also all the reste: then sayd one of them, one hath offended, but all are punished. The wickednesse of one, often hurteth many. A woman somtime had a chyld to nurse, whom she thretned to cast to the Wolf except he left his crying. It happened that the Wolfe passing that way, hearde what shee sayde: wherevpon being in good hope, he wayted still at the doore. The chylde at length beeing stilled, fell a sleepe, the Wolf returned fastyng into the couerte with a Flea in his eare. The shee Wolfe asked for his pray. Mary (quod he sighing) I was deceyued, a Nurse promised to cast me a boy that cryed, but she dyd not. No credit is to be had in a woma. There was a yong Woman whose husband lay at the poynt of death, whome with these words hir father comforted saying: Daughter, vexe not so much thy selfe, for I haue prouided thee a husband, much fayrer than he is, which shall soone driue away thy longing for this: but this woman would not harken to hir fathers talke, but blamed him for making mencion so hastily but when hir husband was dead, she asked hir father, weeping, if the yong man were neere, which he sayd should be hir husband. The loue which women haue to their husbands soone weareth away, after they be dead. A certeyne Woman sore beaten of hir husband, fained hir selfe deade, to make him afrayd, for shee hild hir breath, and lay with hir face vpward, not once stirring: This wise man knowing well the fetches of women, sayd: The deade beast must bee flayde, and he caught vp a knife, and began to flaye the skin from hir feete: shee perceyuing the ende of hir dissimulation, plucked back hir feete, and straightway arose. Womens wyles are practised in vayne against wise men. A certeyne Wydow being weary of leading a single lyfe, desired too mary, but shee durst not, bycause shee feared the mocking of the people, which reported euill of those that were twise maried: but hir godmother shewed hir by this pollicie, howe lightly rumors are to be regaded: shee commanded hir to take the white Asse she had, and cause him to be paynted greene, and the to leade him through euery streate, which thing at the first sight was so wondred at, that not only children, but also old me, moued with this strange Wonder, followed the Asse, to behold him, which being dayly led through the citie, they ceased to wonder at. Then sayd hir godmother, the like shall happen to thee, for if thou mary, thou shalt for a few days be a byworde to the people, but within a while after, there shal not be a word spoken of it. No thing is so wonderfull, that in continuance of time will not cease to be wondred at. The Hare iudged him selfe worthy to be preferred before the Foxe, bycause in swift running hee far passed him: the Fox aunswered, I haue a more excellent wit, wherby I do oftner begyle the Dogs, than thou with thy swiftnesse. Wisdom farre passeth strength or swiftnesse.
