If what I have written is to circulate at all, I am naturally anxious that it should circulate as I wrote it. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me to say, that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the public, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under happier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me poetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be held in reverence; they must not---they cannot at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of mankind.

"'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--- Only this, and nothing more." Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;---vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow---sorrow for the lost Lenore--- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--- Nameless here for evermore. And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me---filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--- Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--- This it is, and nothing more." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you"---here I opened wide the door;--- Darkness there, and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" Merely this, and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before. "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--- Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--- 'Tis the wind and nothing more!" Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--- Perched, and sat, and nothing more. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore--- Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!" Quoth the raven, "Nevermore." Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning---little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as "Nevermore." But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered---not a feather then he fluttered--- Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before--- On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before." Then the bird said "Nevermore." Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--- Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of 'Never---nevermore,' " [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--- What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking "Nevermore." This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee---by these angels he hath sent thee Respite---respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" Quoth the raven, "Nevermore." "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!---prophet still, if bird or devil!--- Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--- On this home by Horror haunted---tell me truly, I implore--- Is there--- is there balm in Gilead?---tell me---tell me, I implore!" Quoth the raven, "Nevermore." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil---prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us---by that God we both adore--- Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--- Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore." Quoth the raven, "Nevermore." "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--- "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!---quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!" Quoth the raven, "Nevermore." And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted---nevermore!

Now each visiter shall confess The sad valley's restlessness. Nothing there is motionless--- Nothing save the airs that brood Over the magic solitude. Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees That palpitate like the chill seas Around the misty Hebrides! Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven That rustle through the unquiet Heaven Uneasily, from morn till even, Over the violets there that lie In myriad types of the human eye--- Over the lilies there that wave And weep above a nameless grave! They wave:---from out their fragrant tops Eternal dews come down in drops. They weep:---from off their delicate stems Perennial tears descend in gems.

And my lord he loves me well; But, when first he breathed his vow, I felt my bosom swell--- For the words rang as a knell, And the voice seemed his who fell In the battle down the dell, And who is happy now. But he spoke to re-assure me, And he kissed my pallid brow, While a reverie came o'er me, And to the church-yard bore me, And I sighed to him before me, Thinking him dead D'Elormie, "Oh, I am happy now!" And thus the words were spoken, And this the plighted vow, And, though my faith be broken, And, though my heart be broken, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] Behold the golden token That proves me happy now! Would God I could awaken! For I dream I know not how, And my soul is sorely shaken Lest an evil step be taken,--- Lest the dead who is forsaken May not be happy now.

An opiate vapour, dewy, dim, Exhales from out her golden rim, And, softly dripping, drop by drop, Upon the quiet mountain top, Steals drowsily and musically Into the universal valley. The rosemary nods upon the grave; The lily lolls upon the wave; Wrapping the fog about its breast, The ruin moulders into rest; Looking like Lethe, see! the lake A conscious slumber seems to take, And would not, for the world, awake. All Beauty sleeps!---and lo! where lies (Her casement open to the skies) Irene, with her Destinies! Oh, lady bright! can it be right--- This window open to the night? The wanton airs, from the tree-top, Laughingly through the lattice drop--- The bodiless airs, a wizard rout, Flit through thy chamber in and out, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] And wave the curtain canopy So fitfully---so fearfully--- Above the closed and fringed lid 'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid, That, o'er the floor and down the wall, Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? Why and what art thou dreaming here? Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas, A wonder to these garden trees! Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress! Strange, above all, thy length of tress, And this all solemn silentness! The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, Which is enduring, so be deep! Heaven have her in its sacred keep! This chamber changed for one more holy, This bed for one more melancholy, I pray to God that she may lie Forever with unopened eye, While the dim sheeted ghosts go by! My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, As it is lasting, so be deep! Soft may the worms about her creep! Far in the forest, dim and old, For her may some tall vault unfold--- Some vault that oft hath flung its black And winged pannels fluttering back, Triumphant, o'er the crested palls, Of her grand family funerals--- Some sepulchre, remote, alone, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf321v2&image=321-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] Against whose portal she hath thrown, In childhood, many an idle stone--- Some tomb from out whose sounding door She ne'er shall force an echo more, Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!

Rich reliquary Of lofty contemplation left to Time By buried centuries of pomp and power! At length---at length---after so many days Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst, (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,) I kneel, an altered and an humble man, Amid thy shadows, and so drink within My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory! Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld! Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night! I feel ye now---I feel ye in your strength--- O spells more sure than e'er Judaean king Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane! O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee Ever drew down from out the quiet stars! Here, where a hero fell, a column falls! Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold, A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat! Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!

Tottering above In her highest noon, The enamoured moon Blushes with love, While, to listen, the red levin (With the rapid Pleiads, even, Which were seven,) Pauses in Heaven. And they say (the starry choir And the other listening things) That Israfeli's fire Is owing to that lyre By which he sits and sings--- The trembling living wire Of those unusual strings.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods, And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, With forms that no man can discover For the dews that drip all over; Mountains toppling evermore Into seas without a shore; Seas that restlessly aspire, Surging, unto skies of fire; Lakes that endlessly outspread Their lone waters---lone and dead,--- Their still waters---still and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily.

Death has reared himself a throne In a strange city lying alone Far down within the dim West, Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best Have gone to their eternal rest. There shrines and palaces and towers (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!) Resemble nothing that is ours. Around, by lifting winds forgot, Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie. No rays from the holy heaven come down On the long night-time of that town; But light from out the lurid sea Streams up the turrets silently--- Gleams up the pinnacles far and free--- Up domes---up spires---up kingly halls--- Up fanes---up Babylon-like walls--- Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers--- Up many and many a marvellous shrine Whose wreathed friezes intertwine The viol, the violet, and the vine.

So blend the turrets and shadows there That all seem pendulous in air, While from a proud tower in the town Death looks gigantically down. There open fanes and gaping graves Yawn level with the luminous waves; But not the riches there that lie In each idol's diamond eye--- Not the gaily-jewelled dead Tempt the waters from their bed; For no ripples curl, alas! Along that wilderness of glass--- No swellings tell that winds may be Upon some far-off happier sea--- No heavings hint that winds have been On seas less hideously serene. But lo, a stir is in the air! The wave---there is a movement there! As if the towers had thrust aside, In slightly sinking, the dull tide--- As if their tops had feebly given A void within the filmy Heaven. The waves have now a redder glow--- The hours are breathing faint and low--- And when, amid no earthly moans, Down, down that town shall settle hence. Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, Shall do it reverence.

A voice from out the Future cries, "On! on!"---but o'er the Past (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies Mute, motionless, aghast! For, alas! alas! with me The light of Life is o'er!

Now s'Death and Hell! Am I not---am I not sorely---grievously tempted To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir! Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare For public insult in the streets---before The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee--- Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest--- Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,---I'll taunt thee, Dost hear? with cowardice \---thou wilt not fight me? Thou liest! thou shalt! ( exit .)

There is cultivated in the king's garden at Paris, a species of serpentine aloes without prickles, whose large and beautiful flower exhales a strong odour of the vanilla, during the time of its expansion, which is very short. It does not blow till towards the month of July---you then perceive it gradually open its petals---expand them---fade and die. \--- St. Pierre . 9\. There is found, in the Rhone, a beautiful lily of the Valisnerian kind. Its stem will stretch to the length of three or four feet---thus preserving its head above water in the swellings of the river. 10\. The Hyacinth. 11\. It is a fiction of the Indians, that Cupid was first seen floating in one of these down the river Ganges---and that he still loves the cradle of his childhood. 12\.

The drift of Milton's argument, leads him to employ language which would appear, at first sight, to verge upon their doctrine; but it will be seen imme- diately, that he guards himself against the charge of having adopted one of the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the church. \--- Dr. Sumner's Notes on Milton's Christian Doctrine   . This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary, could never have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of Mesopotamia, was condemned for the opinion, as heretical. He lived in the beginning of the fourth century. His disciples were called Anthropmorphites. \--- Vide Du Pin .

It is said, [Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau, Maundrell, Troilo, D'Arvieux] that after an excessive drought, the vestiges of columns, walls, &c. are seen above the surface. At any season, such remains may be discovered by looking down into the transparent lake, and at such distances as would argue the existence of many settlements in the space now usurped by the 'Asphaltites.' 21\.

It is perhaps not generally known that the moon, in Egypt, has the effect of producing blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed to its rays, to which circumstance the passage evidently alludes. 25\. The Albatross is said to sleep on the wing. 26\. I met with this idea in an old English tale, which I am now unable to obtain and quote from memory:---"The verie essence and, as it were, springeheade and origine of all musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the tress of the forest do make when they growe." 27\. The wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be moonlight. The rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty lines before, has an appearance of affectation. It is, however, imitated from Sir W. Scott, or rather from Claud Halcro---in whose mouth. I admired its effect: O! were there an island, Tho' ever so wild Where woman might smile, and No man be beguil'd, &c. 28\.

So late from Heaven---that dew---it fell ('Mid dreams of an unholy night) Upon me with the touch of Hell, While the red flashing of the light From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er, Appeared to my half-closing eye The pageantry of monarchy, And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar Came hurriedly upon me, telling Of human battle, where my voice, My own voice, silly child!---was swelling (O! how my spirit would rejoice, And leap within me at the cry) The battle-cry of Victory!

"The author occupies an important station in the University of New York, and is advantageously known as a learned commentator on some books of the Old Testament. It would be wrong to depreciate either his attainments or his general orthodoxy; and all that the most earnest and careful exertion of his powers could enable him to do, he has evidently done, to recommend the sentiments unfolded in this volume. Much patient labor and uncommon ingenuity have been brought to bear upon it. There is also a spirit that cannot fail to be attractive---a spirit of candor and modesty, combined with independence. Educated young men, fond of novel and critical disquisitions, and students of divinity who are anxious to prove all things, will wish to make themselves acquainted with its contents." \--- London Baptist Magazine . "The deep and universal interest excited by the appearance of this most able work, has already demanded the issue of a second edition. The promulgation of the theory maintained so learnedly and cogently by the author, has given birth to a sharp and somewhat bitter controversy among theologians; and we are sorry to see that the ill-will engendered has, in some instances, led to the impeachment of the motives of the writer. This can never be justifiable, and is, in this case, most unfounded and unjust. No one who knows Professor Bush, will doubt for an instant the perfect conscientiousness of all that he has written or said: and the very strong and well-considered argument by which he supports his positions, will require something more, by way of answer, than the aspersions to which we have alluded." \--- N. Y. Courier . "Prof. Bush deserves the highest commendation, for giving publicity to his views of this important Scriptural truth. These views differ widely from those commonly received by the religious world; and it is rare, indeed, to meet with the boldness which has been exhibited on this occasion. We believe the author must possess, in no common degree, that rare and precious quality--- fidelsty to one's own convictions of truth,  and we heartily commend the work to the philosophical and the pious." \--- N. Y. Mirror . "What we have read convinces us that Prof. Bush is a deeply-serious believer in the Scriptures, in the soul's immortality, and in future eternal rewards and punishments, and his theories, if adopted, are not calculated to endanger any one's spiritual interests." \--- Boston Recorder .
