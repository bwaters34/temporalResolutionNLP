 This, you see, is a short and commodious philosophy. Yet barbarians have their own , such as it is, if they are not enlightened by our reason. Shall we then condemn them unheard, or will it not be fair to let them have the telling of their own story? Would we know, from what causes the institution of Chivalry was derived? The time of its birth, the situation of the barbarians, amongst whom it arose, must be considered: their wants, designs, and policies must be explored: We must inquire when, and where, and how it came to pass that the western world became familiarized to this Prodigy , which we now start at. Another thing is full as remarkable, and concerns us more nearly. The spirit of Chivalry, was a fire which soon spent itself: But that of Romance , which was kindled at it, burnt long, and continued its light and heat even to the politer ages. The greatest geniuses of our own and foreign countries, such as Ariosto and Tasso in Italy, and Spenser and Milton in England, were seduced by these barbarities of their forefathers; were even charmed by the Gothic Romances. Was this caprice and absurdity in them? Or, may there not be something in the Gothic Romance peculiarly suited to the views of a genius, and to the ends of poetry? And may not the philosophic moderns have gone too far, in their perpetual ridicule and contempt of it? To form a judgment in the case, the rise, progress, and genius of Gothic Chivalry must be explained. The circumstances in the Gothic fictions and manners, which are proper to the ends of poetry (if any such there be) must be pointed out. Reasons, for the decline and rejection of the Gothic taste in later times must be given. You have in these particulars both the Subject , and the Plan of the following Letters. I Look upon Chivalry, as on some mighty River, which the fablings of the poets have made immortal. It may have sprung up amidst rude rocks, and blind deserts. But the noise and rapidity of its course, the extent of country it adorns, and the towns and palaces it ennobles, may lead a traveller out of his way and invite him to take a view of those dark caverns, unde superne Plurimus Eridani per sylvam volvitur amnis. I enter, without more words, on the subject I began to open to you in my last Letter. The old inhabitants of these North-West parts of Europe were extremely given to the love and exercise of arms. The feats of Charlemagne and our Arthur, in particular, were so famous as in later times, when books of Chivalry were composed, to afford a principal subject to the writers of them. But Chivalry , properly so called, and under the idea "of a distinct military order, conferred in the way of investiture, and accompanied with the solemnity of an oath and other ceremonies, as described in the old historians and romancers," was of later date, and seems to have sprung immediately out of the Feudal Constitution . The  FIRST and most sensible effect of this constitution, which brought about so mighty a change in the policies of Europe, was the erection of a prodigious number of petty tyrannies. For, though the great barons were closely tied to the service of their Prince by the conditions of their tenure, yet the power which was given them by it over their own numerous vassals was so great, that, in effect, they all set up for themselves; affected an independency; and were, in truth, a sort of absolute sovereigns, at least with regard to one another. Hence, their mutual aims and interests often interfering, the feudal state was, in a good degree, a state of war: the feudal chiefs were in frequent enmity with each other: the several combinations of feudal tenants were so many separate armies under their head or chief: and their castles were so many fortresses, as well as palaces, of these puny princes. In this state of things one sees, that all imaginable encouragement was to be given to the use of arms, under every different form of attack and defence, according as the safety of these different communities, or the ambition of their leaders, might require. And this condition of the times, I suppose, gave rise to that military institution, which we know by the name of Chivalry . restless spirits and the clashing views of a neighbouring, numerous, and independent nobility, the military discipline of their followers, even in the intervals of peace, was not to be relaxed, and their ardour suffered to grow cool by a total disuse of martial exercises. And hence the proper origin of Justs and Turnaments ; those images of war, which were kept up in the castles of the barons, and, by an useful policy, converted into the amusement of the knights, when their arms were employed on no serious occasion. I call this the proper origin of Justs and Turnaments; for the date of them is carried no higher, as far as I can find even in France (where unquestionably they made their first appearance) than the year 1066; which was not till after the introduction of the feudal government into that country. Soon after, indeed, we find them in England and in Germany; but not till the feudal policy had spread itself in those parts and had prepared the way for them. You see, then, my notion is, that Chivalry was no absurd and freakish institution, but the natural and even sober effect of the feudal policy; whose turbulent genius breathed nothing but war, and was fierce and military even in its amusements. I leave you to revolve this idea in your own mind. You will find, I believe, a reasonable foundation for it in the history of the feudal times, and in the spirit of the feudal government. IF the conjecture, I advanced, of the rise of Chivalry from the circumstances of the feudal government, be thought reasonable, it will now be easy to account for the several CHARACTERISTICS of this singular profession. I. "The passion for arms; the spirit of enterprize; the honour of knighthood; the rewards of valour; the splendour of equipages;" in short, every thing that raises our ideas of the prowess, gallantry, and magnificence of these sons of Mars is naturally and easily explained on this supposition. Ambition, interest, glory all concurred, under such circumstances, to produce these effects. The feudal principles could terminate in nothing else. And when, by the necessary operation of that policy, this turn was given to the thoughts and passions of men, use and fashion would do the rest; and carry them to all the excesses of military fanaticism, which are painted so strongly, but scarcely exaggerated in the old Romances. For instance, one of the strangest circumstances in those books, and which looks most like a mere extravagance of the imagination, is that of the women- warriors , with which they all abound. Butler in his Hudibras, who saw it in this light, ridicules it, as a most unnatural idea, with great spirit. Yet in this representation they did but copy from the manners of the times. Anna Comnena tells us, in the life of her father, that the wife of Robert the Norman fought side by side with her husband, in his battles; that she would rally the flying soldiers, and lead them back to the charge: And Nicetas observes that, in the time of Manual Comnena, there were in one Crusade many women, armed like men, and on horseback. What think you now of Tasso's Clorinda, whose prodigies of valour I dare say you have often laughed at? Or, rather what think you of that constant pair, "Gildippe, & Odoardo amanti e sposi, In valor d'arme, e in lealta famosi?" C. iii. S.40. II. "Their romantic ideas of justice; their passion for adventures; their eagerness to run to the succour of the distressed; and the pride they took in redressing wrongs, and removing grievances;" All these distinguishing characters of genuine Chivalry are explained on the same principle. For, the feudal state being a state of war, or rather of almost perpetual violence, rapine, and plunder, it was unavoidable that, in their constant skirmishes, stratagems, and surprizes, numbers of the tenants or followers of one Baron should be seized upon and carried away by the followers of another: And the interest each had to protect his own, would of course introduce the point of honour in attempting by all means not only to retaliate on the enemy, but to rescue the captive sufferers out of the hands of their oppressors. It would be meritorious, in the highest degree, to fly to their assistance, when they knew where they were to be come at; or to seek them out with diligence, when they did not. This last service they called, Going in quest of adventures ; which at first, no doubt, was confined to those of their own party, but afterwards, by the habit of acting on this principle, would be extended much farther. So that, in process of time, we find the Knights errant, as they were now properly styled, wandering the world over in search of occasions on which to exercise their generous and disinterested valour, Ecco quei, che le charte empion di sogni, Lancilotto, Tristano, egli altri erranti. III. "The courtesy, affability and gallantry, for which these adventurers were so famous, are but the natural effects and consequences of their situation." For the castles of the Barons were, as I said, the courts of these little sovereigns, as well as their fortresses; and the resort of their vassals thither, in honour of their chiefs, and for their own proper security, would make that civility and politeness, which is seen in courts and insensibly prevails there, a predominant part in the character of these assemblies. This is the poet's own account of \- - - - court and royal citadel, The great school-maistresse of all Courtesy. B. III. C. v. St. I. And again, more largely in B. VI. C. i. S. I . Of Court it seems men Courtesie doe call, For that it there most useth to abound; And well beseemeth that in Princes hall That Virtue should be plentifully found, Which of all goodly manners is the ground And roote of civil conversation: Right so in faery court it did resound, Where courteous knights and ladies most did won Of all on earth, and made a matchless paragon. For Faery Court means the reign of Chivalry ; which, it seems, had undergone a fatal revolution before the age of Milton, who tells us that Courtesy \- - - is sooner found in lonely sheds With smoaky rafters, than in tap'stry halls And courts of princes, where it first was nam'd, And yet is most pretended. Further, The free commerce of the ladies, in those knots and circles of the great, would operate so far on the sturdiest knights as to give birth to the attentions of gallantry. But this gallantry would take a refined turn, not only from the necessity there was of maintaining the strict forms of decorum, amidst a promiscuous conversation under the eye of the Prince and in his own family; but also from the inflamed sense they must needs have of the frequent outrages committed, by their neighbouring clans of adversaries, on the honour of the Sex, when by chance of war they had fallen into their hands. Violations of chastity being the most atrocious crimes they had to charge on their enemies, they would pride themselves in the glory of being its protectors: And as this virtue was, of all others, the fairest and strongest claim of the sex itself to such protection, it is no wonder that the notions of it were, in time, carried to so platonic an elevation. Thus, again, the great master of Chivalry himself, on this subject, It hath been thro' all ages ever seen, That, with the praise of arms and chivalry, The prize of beauty still hath joined been; And that for reason's special privity: For either doth on other much rely; For He mee seems most fit the fair to serve, That can her best defend from villany; And She most fit his service doth deserve, That fairest is, and from her faith will never swerve. Not but the foundation of this refined gallantry was laid in the antient manners of the German nations. Caesar tells us how far they carried their practice of chastity, which he seems willing to account for on political principles. However that be, their consideration of the sex was prodigious, as we see in the history of their irruptions into the Empire; where, among all their ravages and devastations of other sorts, we find they religiously abstained from offering any violence to the honour of the women. IV . It only remains to account for that "character of Religion," which was so deeply imprinted on the minds of all knights and was essential to their institution. We are even told, that the love of God and of the Ladies went hand in hand, in the duties and ritual of Chivalry. Two reasons may be assigned for this singularity, First, the superstition of the Times, in which Chivalry arose; which was so great that no institution of a public nature could have found credit in the world, that was not consecrated by the Church-men, and closely interwoven with religion. Secondly, the condition of the Christian world; which had been harassed by long wars, and had but just recovered a breathing-time from the brutal ravages of the Saracen armies. The remembrance of what they had lately suffered from these grand enemies of the faith, made it natural and even necessary to engage a new military order on the side of religion. And how warmly this principle, a zeal for the faith , was acted upon by the professors of Chivalry, and how deeply it entered into their ideas of the military Character, we see from the term so constantly used by the old Romancers, of Recreant Knight; by which they meant to express, with the utmost force, their disdain of a dastard or vanquished knight. For many of this order falling into the hands of the Saracens, such of them as had not imbibed the full Spirit of their profession, were induced to renounce their faith, in order to regain their liberty. These men, as sinning against the great fundamental laws of Chivalry, they branded with this name; a name of complicated reproach, which implied a want of the two most essential qualities of a Knight, Courage and Faith . And here, by the way, the reason appears why the Spaniards, of all the Europeans, were furthest gone in every characteristic madness of true chivalry. To all the other considerations, here mentioned, their fanaticism in every way was especially instigated and kept alive by the memory and neighbourhood of their old infidel invaders. And thus we seem to have a fair account of that Prowess , Generosity , characteristics of the purer ages of Chivalry. Such was the state of things in the western World, when the crusades to the holy land were set on foot. Whence we see how well prepared the minds of men were for engaging in that enterprize. Every object, that had entered into the views of the institutors of chivalry, and had been followed by it's professors, was now at hand to inflame the military and religious ardor of the knights, to the utmost. And here, in fact, we find the strongest and boldest features of their genuine character: Daring to madness, in enterprizes of hazard: Burning with zeal for the delivery of the oppressed ; and, which was deemed the height of religious merit, for the rescue of the holy city out of the hands of infidels: And, lastly, exalting their honour of chastity so high as to profess celibacy; as they constantly did, in the several orders of knighthood created on that extravagant occasion. WHAT think you, my good friend, of my last learned Letter? Don't you begin to favour this conjecture, as whimsical as it may seem, of the rise and genius of knight-errantry? But you ask me where I learned the several particulars, on which I form this profound system. You are willing, I perceive, to advance on sure grounds; and call upon me to point out to you the authorities, from which I pretend to have collected the several marks and characteristics of true chivalry. Your request is reasonable, and I acknowledge the ommission in not acquainting you that my information was taken from it's proper Source, the old Romances . Not that I shall make a merit with you in having perused these barbarous volumes my self; much less would I impose the ungrateful task upon you. Thanks to the curiosity of certain painful collectors, this knowledge may be obtained at a cheaper rate. And I think it sufficient to refer you to a learned and very elaborate Memoir of a French writer, who has put together all that is requisite to be known on this subject. Materials are first laid in, before the Architect goes to work; and if the structure, I am here raising out of them, be to your mind, you will not think the worse of it, because I pretend not, myself, to have worked in the quarry. In a word, and to drop this magnificent allusion, if I account to you for the rise and genius of chivalry, it is all you are to expect: For an idea of what chivalry was in itself, you may have recourse to the xx tom. of the Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions and belles Lettres . And with this explanation I return to my proper business. Supposing my idea of chivalry to be fairly given, the conjecture I advance on the origin and nature of it, you incline to think, may deserve to be admitted. But you may, perhaps, admit it the more readily if you reflect, "That there is a remarkable correspondency between the manners of the old heroic times, as painted by their great romancer, Homer, and those which are represented to us in the books of modern knight-errantry." A fact, of which no good account, I believe, can be given but by the assistance of another, not less certain, "That the political state of Greece, in the earlier periods of it's story, was similar in many respects to that of Europe, as broken by the feudal system into an infinite number of petty independent governments." It is not my design to encroach on the province of the learned person  1 , to whom I owe this hint, and who hath undertaken, at his leisure, to enlarge upon it. But some few circumstances of agreement between the heroic and gothic manners, such as are most obvious and occur to my memory, while I am writing, may be worth putting down, by way of specimen only of what may be expected from a professed inquiry into this curious subject. And, First , "the military enthusiasm of the Barons is but of a piece with the fanaticism of the Heroes." Hence the same particularity of description in the account of battles, wounds, deaths in the Greek poet, as in the gothic romancers. Hence that perpetual succession of combats and deeds of arms, even to satiety, in the Iliad: And hence that minute curiosity in the display of their dresses, arms, accountrements, which appears so strange, in that poem. The minds of all men, being occupied and in a manner possessed with warlike images and ideas, were much gratified by the poet's dwelling on the very slightest circumstances of these things; which now, for want of their prejudices, appear cold and unaffecting to modern readers. But the correspondency holds in more particular considerations. For 2\. "We hear much of Knights-errant encountering Giants , and quelling Savages , in books of chivalry." These Giants were oppressive feudal Lords, and every Lord was to be met with, like the Giant, in his strong hold, or castle. Their dependants of a lower form, who imitated the violence of their superiors, and had not their castles, but their lurking-places, were the Savages of Romance. The greater Lord was called a Giant, for his power; the less, a Savage, for his brutality. All this is shadowed out of the gothic tales, and sometimes expressed in plain words. The objects of the knight's vengeance go indeed by the various names of Giants, Paynims, Saracens, and Savages. But of what family they all are, is clearly seen from the Poet's description. What Mister wight, quoth he, and how far hence Is he, that doth to travellers such harms? He is, said he, a man of great defence, Expert in battle, and in deeds of arms; And more embolden'd by the wicked charms With which his daughter doth him still support; Having great Lordships got and goodly farms Thro' strong oppression of his pow'r extort' By which he still them holds and keeps with strong effort. And daily he his wrong encreaseth more: For never wight he lets to pass that way Over his bridge, albee he rich or poor, But he him makes his passage-penny pay: Else he doth hold him back or beat away. Thereto he hath a Groom of evil Guise Whose scalp is bare that bondage doth bewray, Which polls and pills the poor in piteous wise, But he himself upon the rich doth tyrannize. Here we have the great oppressive Baron very graphically set forth: And the Groom of evil guise is as plainly the Baron's vassal. The romancers, we see, took no great liberty with these respectable personages, when they called the one a Giant, and the other a Savage. "Another terror of the gothic ages was, Monsters, Dragons , and Serpents. " These stories were received in those days for several reasons: 1. From the vulgar belief of enchantments: 2. From their being reported on the faith of Eastern tradition, by the adventures into the holy land: 3. In still later times, from the strange things told and believed, on the discovery of the new world. This last consideration we find employed by Spenser to give an air of probability to his Faery tales, in the preface to his second book. Now in all these respects Greek antiquity very much resembles the Gothic. For what are Homer's Laestrigons, and Cyclops, but bands of lawless savages, with, each of them, a Giant of enormous size at their head? And what are the Grecian Bacchus, Hercules, and Theseus but Knights-errant, the exact counter-parts of Sir Launcelot and Amadis de Gaule? For this interpretation we have the authority of our great Poet. Such first was Bacchus , that with furious might All th'East, before untam'd, did overcome, And wrong repressed and establish'd right, Which lawless men had formerly fordonne. Next Hercules his like ensample shew'd, Who all the West with equal conquest wonne, And monstrous tyrants with his club subdu'd, The club of justice drad, with kingly pow'r endu'd. B. v. C. i. Nay, could the very castle of a Gothic giant be better described than in the words of Homer, High walls and battlements the courts inclose, And the strong gates defy a host of foes. Od. B. XVII. ver. 318. And do not you remember that the Grecian worthiers were, in their day, as famous for encountering Dragons and quelling Monsters of all sorts, as for suppressing Giants? \---per hos cecidere justa Morte Centauri, cecidit tremendae Flamma Chimaerae. 3\. "The oppressions, which it was the glory of the knight to avenge, were frequently carried on, as we are told, by the charms and enchantments of women." These charms , we may suppose, are often metaphorical; as expressing only the blandishments of the sex, by which they either seconded the designs of their Lords, or were enabled to carry on designs for themselves. Sometimes they are taken to be real; the ignorance of those ages acquiescing in such conceits. And are not these stories matched by those of Calypso and Circe, the enchantresses of the Greek poet? Still they are conformities more directly to our purpose. 4\. "Robbery and Pyracy were honourable in both; so far were they from reflecting any discredit on the antient or modern redresses of wrongs. " What account can be given of this, but that, in the feudal times and in the early days of Greece, when government was weak and unable to redress the frequent injuries of petty sovereigns, it would be glorious for private adventurers to undertake this work; and, if they could accomplish it in no other way, to pay them in kind by downright plunder and rapine? This in effect is the account given us, of the same disposition of the old Germans, by Caesar. "Latrocinia, says he, nullam habent infamiam, quae extra fines cujusque civitatis fiunt." And the reason appears from what he had just told us---in pace, nullus est communis magistratus; sed principes regionum atque pagorum inter suos jus dicunt, controversiasque minuunt." De bello Gall. l. vi.  § 21\. 5\. Their manners, in another respect, were the same. "Bastardy was in credit with both." They were extremely watchful over the chastity of their own women; but such as they could seize upon in the enemy's quarter, were lawful prize. Or, if at any time they transgressed in this sort at home, the heroic ages were complaisant enough to cover the fault by an ingenious fiction. The offspring was reputed divine. Nay, so far did they carry their indulgence to this commerce, that their greatest heroes were the fruit of Goddesses approached by mortals; just as we hear of the doughtiest knights being born of Fairies. 6\. Is it not strange, that, together with the greatest fierceness and savageness of character, "The utmost generosity, hospitality, and courtesy should be imputed to the heroic ages?" Achilles was at once the most relentless, vindictive, implacable, and the friendliest of men. We have the very same representation in the Gothic Romances, where it is almost true what Butler says humorously of these benign heroes, that They did in fight but cut work out T' employ their courtesies about. How are these contradictions to be reconciled but by observing, that, as in those lawless times dangers and distresses of all sorts abounded, there would be the same demand for compassion, gentleness, and generous attachments to the unfortunate, those especially of their own clan, as of resentment, rage, and animosity against their enemies? 7\. Again: Consider the martial Games , which antient Greece delighted to celebrate on great and solemn occasions: And see if they had not the same origin, and the same purpose, as the Tournaments of the Gothic warriors. 8\. Lastly, "the passion for adventures, so natural in their situation, would be as naturally attended with the love of praise and glory." Hence the same encouragement, in the old Greek and Gothic times, to panegyrists and poets; the Bards being as welcome to the tables of the feudal lords, as the ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ![](/images/inline/Igk.gif) ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ![](/images/inline/Igk.gif)  of old, to those of the Grecian heroes. And, as the same causes ever produce the same effects, we find that, even so late as Elizabeth's reign, the savage Irish (who were much in the state of the antient Greeks, living under the anarchy, rather than government, of their numberless puny chiefs) had their rhymers in principal estimation. It was for the reason just given, for the honour of their panegyrics on their fierce adventures and sucesses. And thus it was in Greece. For chief to Poets such respect belongs By rival nations courted for their Songs; These, states invite, and mighty kings admire Wide as the Sun displays his vital fire. Od. B. XVII. THE purpose of the causal hints, suggested in my last letter, was only to shew that the resemblance between the heroic and Gothic ages is very great. And tho' you say true, that ignorance and barbarity itself might account for some circumstances of this resemblance, yet the parallel would hardly have held so long, and run so closely, if the civil condition of both had not been much the same. So that when we see a sort of chivalry springing up among the Greeks, who were confessedly in a state resembling that of the feudal barons, and attended by the like symptoms and effects, is it not fair to conclude that the chivalry of the Gothic times was owing to that common corresponding state , and received it's character from it? And this circumstance, by the way, accounts for the constant mixture, which the modern critic esteems so monstrous, of pagan fables with the fairy tales of Romance. The passion for antient learning, just then revived, might reduce the classic poets, such as Spenser and Tasso, for instance, into this practice; but the similar turn and genius of antient manners and of the fictions founded upon them, would make it appear easy and natural in all. I am aware, as you object to me, that, in the affair of Religion and Gallantry , the resemblance between the hero and knight is not so striking. But the religious character of the knight was an accident of the times, and no proper effect of his civil condition. And that his devotion for the sex should so far surpass that of the hero, is a fresh confirmation of my system. For, tho' much, no doubt, might be owing to the different humour and genius of the East and West, antecedent to any custom and forms of government, and independent of them, yet the consideration had of the females in the feudal constitution will, of itself, account for this difference. It made them capable of succeeding to fiefs as well as the men. And does not one see, on the instant, what respect and dependence this privilege would draw upon them? It was of mighty consequence who should obtain the grace of a rich heiress. And tho', in the strict feudal times, she was supposed to be in the power and disposal of her superior Lord, yet this rigid state of things did not last long; and, while it did last, could not abate much of the homage that would be paid to the fair feudatary. Thus, when interest had begun the habit, the language of love and flattery would soon do the rest. And to what that language tended you may see by the constant strain of the Romances themselves. Some distressed damsel was the spring and mover of every knight's adventure. She was to be rescued by his arms, or won by the fame and admiration of his prowess. The plain meaning of all which was this: That, as in those turbulent feudal times a protector was necessary to the weakness of the sex, so the courteous and valorous knight was to approve himself fully qualified for that office. And we find, he had other motives to set him on work than the mere charms and graces, though ever so bewitching, of the person addressed. Hence then, as I suppose, the custom was introduced: and, when introduced, you will hardly wonder it should operate much longer and farther than the reason may seem to require, on which it was founded. In conclusion of this topic I must just observe to you, that the two poems of Homer express in the liveliest manner, and were intended to expose, the capital mischiefs and inconveniences arising from the political state of old Greece: The Iliad, the dissensions that naturally spring up amongst a number of independent chiefs; And the Odyssey, the insolence of their greater subjects, more especially when unrestrained by the presence of their sovereign. These were the subjects of his pen. And can any thing more exactly resemble the condition of the feudal times , when, on occasion of any great enterprize, as that of the Crusades, the designs of the confederate Christian states were perpetually frustrated, or interrupted at least, by the dissensions of their leaders; and their affairs at home as perpetually distressed and disordered by the rebellious usurpations of their greater vassals? So that Jerusalem was to the European, what Troy had been to the Grecian Princes. And you will now, I believe, not be surprized to find that Tasso's immortal poem was planned after the model of the Iliad. LET it be no surprize to you that, in the close of my last Letter, I presumed to bring the Gierusalemme liberata into competition with the Iliad. So far as the heroic and Gothic manners are the same, the pictures of each, if well taken, must be equally entertaining. But I go further, and maintain that the circumstances, in which they differ, are clearly to the advantage of the Gothic designers. You see, my purpose is to lead you from this forgotten chivalry to a more amusing subject, I mean the Poetry we still read, and which was founded upon it. Much has been said, and with great truth, of the felicity of Homer's age, for poetical manners. But as Homer was a citizen of the world, when he had seen in Greece, on the one hand, the manners he has described, could he, on the other hand, have seen in the west the manners of the feudal ages, I make no doubt but he would certainly have preferred the latter. And the grounds of this preference would, I suppose, have been " The improved gallantry of the feudal times; and the superior solemnity of their superstitions. " If any great poet, like Homer, had lived amongst, and sung of, the Gothic knights (for after all Spenser and Tasso came too late, and it was impossible for them to paint truly and perfectly what was no longer seen or believed) this preference, I persuade myself, had been very sensible. But their fortune was not so happy. \---omnes illacrymabiles Urgentur, ignotique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro. As it is, we may take a guess of what the subject was capable of affording to real genius from the rude sketches we have of it, in the old Romancers. And it is but looking into any of them to be convinced that the gallantry, which inspirited the feudal times, was of a nature to furnish the poet with finer scenes and subjects of description in every view, than the simple and uncontrolled barbarity of the Grecian. The principal entertainment arising from the delineation of these consists in the exercise of the boisterous passions, which are provoked and kept alive from one end of the Iliad to the other, by every imaginable scene of rage, revenge, and slaughter. In the other, together with these, the gentler and more humane affections are awakened in us by the most interesting displays of love and friendship; of love, elevated to it's noblest heights; and of friendship, operating on the purest motives. The mere variety of these paintings is a relief to the reader, as well as writer. But their beauty, novelty, and pathos give them a vast advantage, on the comparison. Consider, withal, the surprizes, accidents, adventures which probably and naturally attend on the life of wandering knights; the occasion there must be for describing the wonders of different countries, and of presenting to view the manners and policies of distant states: all which make so conspicuous a part of the materials of the greater poetry. So that, on the whole, tho' the spirit, passions, rapin, and violence of the two sets of manners were equal, yet there was a dignity, a magnificence, a variety in the feudal, which the other wanted. As to religious machinery , perhaps the popular system of each was equally remote from reason, yet the latter had something in it more amusing, as well as more awakening to the imagination. The current popular tales of Elves and Fairies were even fitter to take the credulous mind, and charm it into a willing admiration of the specious miracles , which wayward fancy delights in, than those of the old traditionary rabble of pagan divinities. And then, for the more solemn fancies of witchcraft and incantation, the horrors of the Gothic were above measure striking and terrible. The mummeries of the pagan priests were childish, but the Gothic Enchanters shook and alarmed all nature. We feel this difference very sensibly in reading the antient and modern poets. You would not compare the Canidia of Horace with the Witches in Macbeth. And what are Virgil's myrtles dropping blood, to Tasso's enchanced forest? Ovid indeed, who had a fancy turn'd to romance, makes Medea, in a rant; talk wildly. But was this the common language of their other writers? The enchantress in Virgil says cooly of the very chiefest prodigies of her charms and poisons, His ego saepe lupum fieri, & se condere sylvis Moerin; saepe animas imis excire sepulchris, Atque satas alio vidi traducere messes. The admirable poet has given an air of the marvellous to his subject, by the magic of his expression. Else, what do we find here, but the ordinary effects of melancholy , the vulgar superstition of evoking Spirits , and the supposed influence of fascination on the hopes of rural industry. Non isthic obliquo oculo mihi commoda quisquam Limat--- --- says the poet of his country-seat, as if this security from a fascinating Eye were a singular privilege, and the mark of a more than common good fortune. Shakespear, on the other hand, with a terrible sublime (which not so much the energy of his genius, as the nature of his subject drew from him) gives us another idea of the rough magic , as he calls it, of fairy enchantment. \---I have bedimm'd The noon-tide Sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds. And' twixt the green sea and the azure vault Set roaring war; to the dread ratling thunder Have I giv'n fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt: The strong-bas'd promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurrs pluck'd up The Pine and Cedar: Graves, at my command, Have open'd, and let forth their sleepers--- The last circumstance, you will say, is but the animas imis excire sepulchris of the latin poet. But a very significant word marks the difference. The pagan necromancers had a hundred little tricks by which they pretended to call up the ghosts, or shadows of the dead: but these, in the ideas of paganism, were quite another thing from Shakespear's Sleepers . This may serve for a cast of Shakespear's magic. And I can't but think that, when Milton wanted to paint the horrors of that night (one of the noblest parts in his Paradise Regained( which the Devil himself is feigned to conjure up in the wilderness, the Gothic language and ideas helped him to work up his tempest with such terror. You will judge from these lines: \---nor staid the terror there; Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round Environ'd; some howl'd, some yell'd, some skriek'd, Some bent at thee their fiery darts--- But above all from the following, Thus pass'd the night so foul, till morning fair Came forth with pilgrim steps in amice gray, Who with her radiant finger still'd the roar Of thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds And griesly specters \------ Where the radiant finger poins at the potent wand of the Gothic magicians, which could reduce the calm of nature, upon occasion, as well as disturb it; and the griesly specters laid by the approach of morn, were apparently of their raising, as a sagacious critic perceived when he took notice "how very injudicious it was to retail the popular superstition in this place  2 ." After all, the conclusion is not to be drawn so much from particular passages, as from the general impression left on our minds in reading the ancient and modern poets. And this is so much in favour of the Latter , that Mr. Addison scruples not to say, "The Ancients have not much of this poetry among them; for, indeed (continues he) almost the whole substance of it owes it's original to the darkness and superstition of later ages--Our forefathers looked upon nature with more reverence and horror, before the world was enlightened by learning and philosophy, and loved to astonish themselves with the apprehensions of Witchcraft, Prodigies, Charms, and enchantments. There was not a village in England, that had not a Ghost in it; the churchyards were all haunted, every large common had a circle of fairies belonging to it, and there was scarce a Shepherd to be met with who had not seen a spirit." We are upon enchanted ground, my friend; and you are to think yourself well used that I detain you no longer in this fearful circle. The glympse, you have had of it, will help your imagination to conceive the rest. And without more words you will readily apprehend that the fancies of our modern bards are not only more gallant, but, on a change of the scene, more sublime, more terrible, more alarming, than those of the classic fablers. In a word, you will find that the manners they paint, and the superstitions they adopt, are the more poetical for being Gothic. BUT nothing shews the difference of the two systems under consideration more plainly, than the effect they really had on the two greatest of our Poets; at least the Two which an English reader is most fond to compare with Homer, I mean Spenser and Milton . It is not to be doubted but that each of these bards had kindled his poetic fire from classic fables. So that, of course, their prejudices would lie that way. Yet they both appear, when most inflamed, to have been more particularly rapt with the Gothic fables of chivalry, Spenser, tho' he had been long nourished with the spirit and substance of Homer and Virgil, chose the times of chivalry for his theme, and fairy Land for the scene of his fictions. He could have planned, no doubt, an heroic design on the exact classic model: Or, he might have trimmed between the Gothic and Classic, as his contemporary Tasso did. But the charms of fairy prevailed. And if any think he was seduced by Ariosto into this choice, they should consider that it could be only for the sake of his subject; for the genius and character of these poets was widely different. Under this idea then of a Gothic, not clasical poem, the Faery Queen is to be read and criticized. And on these principles, it would not be difficult to unfold it's merit in another way than has been hitherto attempted. Milton, it is true preferred the classic model to the Gothic. But it was after long hesitation; and his favourite subject was Arthur and his Knights of the round table . On this he had fixed for the greater part of his life. What led him to change his mind was, partly, as I suppose, his growing fanaticism; partly, his ambition to take a different rout from Spenser; but chiefly perhaps, the discredit into which the stories of chivalry had now fallen by the immortal satire of Cervantes. Yet we see thro' all his poetry, where his enthusiasm flames out most, a certain predilection for the legends of chivalry before the fables of Greece. This circumstance, you know, has given offence to the austerer and more mechanical critics. They are ready to censure his judgment, as juvenile and unformed, when they see him so delighted, on all occasions, with the Gothic romances. But do these censors imagine that Milton did not perceive the defects of these works, as well as they? No: it was not the composition of books of chivalry, but the manners described in them, that took his fancy; as appears from his Allegro \--- Towred cities please us then And the busy hum of men, Where throngs of knights and barons bold In weeds of peace high triumphs hold, With store of ladies, whose bright eyes Rain influence and judge the prize Of wit, or arms, while both contend To win her grace, whom all commend. And when in the Penseroso he draws, by a fine contrivance, the same kind of image to sooth melancholy which he had before given to excite mirth, he indeed extolls an author of one of these romances, as he had before, in general, extolled the subject of them; but it is an author worthy of his praise; not the writer of Amadis , or Sir Launcelot of the Lake , but Chaucer himself, who has left an unfinished story on the Gothic or feudal model. Or, call up him that left half-told The story of Cambuscan bold, Of Camball and of Algarsife, And who had Canace to wife That own'd the virtuous ring and glass, And of the wondrous horse of brass, On which the Tartar king did ride; And if ought else great bards beside In sage and solemn tunes have sung Of turneys and of trophies hung, Of forests and inchantments drear, Where more is meant than meets the ear. The conduct then of these two poets may incline us to think with more respect, than is commonly done of the Gothic manners , I mean as adapted to the uses of the greater poetry. I say nothing of Shakespear, because the sublimity (the divinity, let it be, if nothing else will serve) of his genius kept no certain rout, but rambled at hazard into all the regions of human life and manners. So that we can hardly say what he preferred, or what he rejected, on full deliberation. Yet one thing is clear, that even he is greater when he uses Gothic manners and machinery, than when he employs classical: which brings us again to the same point, that the former have, by their nature and genius, the advantage of the latter in producing the sublime . I spoke "of criticizing Spenser's poem," under the idea, not of a classical but Gothic composition." It is certain much light might be thrown on that singular work, were an able critic to consider it in this view. For instance, he might go some way towards explaining, perhaps justifying, the general plan and conduct of the Faery Queen, which, to classical readers, has appeared indefensible. I have taken the fancy, with your leave, to try my hand on this curious subject. When an architect examines a Gothic structure by Grecian rules, he finds nothing but deformity. But the Gothic architecture has it's own rules, by which, when it comes to be examined, it is seen to have it's merit, as well as the Grecian. The question is not, which of the two is conducted in the simplest or truest taste: but, whether there be not sense and design in both, when scrutinized by the laws on which each is projected. The same observation holds of the two sorts of poetry. Judge of the Faery Queen by the classic models, and you are shocked with it's disorder: consider it with an eye to it's Gothic original, and you find it regular. The unity and simplicity of the former are more complete: but the latter has that sort of unity and simplicity, which results from it's nature. The Faery Queen then, as a Gothic poem, derives it's Method , as well as the other characters of it's composition, from the established modes and ideas of chivalry. It was usual, in the days of knight-errantry, at the holding of any great feast, for Knights to appear before the prince, who presided at it, and claim the privilege of being sent on any adventure, to which the solemnity might give occasion. For it was supposed that, when such a throng of knights and barons bold , as Milton speaks of, were got together, the distressed would flock in from all quarters, as to a place where they knew they might find and claim redress for all their grievances. This was the real practice, in the days of pure and antient chivalry. And an image of this practice was afterwards kept up in the castles of the great, on any extraordinary festival or solemnity: of which, if you want an instance, I refer you to the description of a feast made at Lisle in 1453, in the court of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, for a crusade against the Turks: As you may find it given at large in the memoirs of Matthieu de Conci, Olivier de la Marche , and Monstrelet . That feast was held for twelve days: and each day was distinguished by the claim and allowance of some adventure. Now laying down this practice, as a foundation for the poet's design, you will see how properly the Faery Queen is conducted. \---"I devise, says the poet himself in his Letter to Sir W. Raleigh, that the Faery Queen kept her annual feaste xii days: upon which xii several days, the occasions of the xii several adventures hapened; which being undertaken by xii several knights, are in there xii books severally handled." Here you have the poet delivering his own method, and the reason of it. It arose out of the order of his subject. And would you desire a better reason for his choice? Yes; you will say, a poet's method is not that of his subject. I grant you, as to the order of time , in which the recital is made; for here, as Spenser observes (and his own practice agrees to the Rule) lies the main difference between the poet historical, and the historiographer: The reason of which is drawn from the nature of Epic composition itself, and holds equally, let the suject be what it will, and whatever the system of manners be, on which it is conducted. Gothic or Classic makes no difference in this respect. But the case is not the same with regard to the general plan of a work, or what may be called the order of distribution , which is and must be governed by the subject-matter itself. It was as requisite for the Faery Queen to consist of the adventures of twelve knights, as for the Odyssey to be confined to the adventures of one Hero: Justice had otherwise not been done to his subject. So that if you will say any thing against the poet's method, you must say that he should not have chosen this subject. But this objection arises from your classic ideas of Unity, which have no place here; and are in every view foreign to the purpose, if the poet has found means to give his work, tho' consisting of many parts, the advantage of Unity. For in some reasonable sense or other, it is agreed, every work of art must be one , the very idea of a work requiring it. If you ask then, what is this Unity of Spenser's Poem? I say, It consists in the relation of it's several adventures to one common original , the appointment of the Faery Queen; and to one common end , the completion of the Faery Queen's injunctions. The knights issued forth on their adventures on the breaking up of this annual feast; and the next annual feast, we are to suppose, is to bring them together again from the atchievement of their several charges. This, it is true, is not the classic Unity, which consists in the representation of one entire action: but it is an Unity of another sort, an unity resulting from the respect which a number of related actions have to one common purpose. In other words, It is an unity of design , and not of action. This Gothic method of design in poetry may be, in some sort, illustrated by what is called the Gothic method of design in Gardening. A wood or grove cut out into many separate avenues or glades was amongst the most favourite of the works of art, which our fathers attempted in the species of cultivation. These walks were distinct from each other, had, each, their several destination, and terminated on their own proper objects. Yet the whole was brought together and considered under one view by the relation which these various openings had, not to each other, but to their common and concurrent center. You and I are, perhaps, agreed that this sort of gardening is not of so true a taste as that which Kent and Nature have brought us acquainted with; where the supreme art of the Designer consists in disposing his ground and objects into an entire landskip ; and grouping them, if I may use the term, in so easy a manner, that the careless observer, tho' he be taken with the symmetry of the whole, discovers no art in the combination: In lieto aspetto il bel giardin s'aperse, Acque stagnanti, mobili cristalli; Fior vari, e varie piante, herbe diverse, Apriche Collinette, ombrose valli, Selve, espelunche in UNA VISTA offerse: E quel, che'l bello, e'l caro accresce a l'opre, L'Arte, che tutto fa, nulla si scopre. This, I say, may be the truest taste in gardening, because the simplest: Yet there is a manifest regard to unity in the other method; which has had it's admirers, as it may have again, and is certainly not without it's design and beauty. But to return to our poet. Thus far he drew from Gothic ideas, and these ideas, I think, would lead him no farther. But, as Spenser knew what belonged to classic composition, he was tempted to tie his subject still closer together by one expedient of his own, and by another taken from his classic models. His own was to interrupt the proper story of each book, by dispersing it into several; involving by this means, and as it were intertwisting the several actions together, in order to give something like the appearance of one action to his twelve adventures. And for this conduct, as absurd as it seems, he had some great examples in the Italian poets, tho', I believe, they were led into it by different motives. The other expedient which he borrowed from the classics, was by adopting one superior character, which should be seen throughout. Prince Arthur, who had a separate adventure of his own, was to have his part in each of the other; and thus several actions were to be embodied by the interest which one principal Hero had in them all. It is even observable, that Spenser gives this adventure of Prince Arthur, in quest of Gloriana, as the proper subject of his poem. And upon this idea the late learned editor of the Faery Queen has attempted, but I think without success, to defend the Unity and simplicity of it's fable. The truth was, the violence of classic prejudices forced the poet to affect this appearance of unity, tho' in contradiction to his Gothic system. And, as far as we can judge of the tenour of the whole work from the finished half of it, the adventure of Prince Arthur, whatever the author pretended, and his critic too easily believed, was but an after-thought; and at least with regard to the historical fable , which we are now considering, was only one of the expedients by which he would conceal the disorder of his Gothic plan. And, if this was his design, I will venture to say that both his expedients were injudicious. Their purpose was to ally two things, in nature incompatible, the Gothic, and the classic unity; the effect of which misalliance was to discover and expose the nakedness of the Gothic. I am of opinion then, considering the Faery Queen as an epic or narrative poem constructed on Gothic ideas, that the Poet had done well to affect no other unity than that of design , by which his subject was connected. But his poem is not simply narrative; it is throughout Allegorical: he calls it a perpetual allegory or dark conceit: and this character, for reasons I may have occasion to observe hereafter, was even predominant in the Faery Queen. His narration is subservient to his moral, and but serves to colour it. This he tells us himself at setting out; Fierce wars and faithful loves shall moralize my song; that is, shall serve for a vehicle, or instrument, to convey the moral. Now under this idea, the Unity of the Faery Queen is more apparent. His twelve knights art to exemplify as many virtues, out of which one illustrious character is to be composed. And in this view the part of Prince Arthur in each book becomes essential , and yet not principal ; exactly, as the poet has contrived it. They who rest in the literal story, that is, who criticize it on the footing of a narrative poem, have constantly objected to this management. They say, it necessarily breaks the unity of design. Prince Arthur, they affirm, should either have had no part in the other adventures, or he should have had the chief part. He should either have done nothing, or more. And the objection is unanswerable; at least I know of nothing that can be said to remove it but what I have supposed above might be the purpose of the poet, and which I myself have rejected as insufficient. But how faulty soever this conduct be in the literal story, it is perfectly right in the moral: and that for an obvious reason, tho' his critics seem not to have been aware of it. His chief hero was not to have the twelve virtues in the degree in which the knights had, each of them, their own; (such a character would be a monster) but he was to have so much of each as was requisite to form his superior character. Each virtue, in it's perfection, is exemplified in it's own knight: they are all, in a due degree, concentered in Prince Arthur. This was the poet's moral: And what way of expressing this moral in the history , but by making Prince Arthur appear in each adventure, and in a manner subordinate to it's proper hero? Thus, tho' inferior to each in his own specific virtue, he is superior to all by uniting the whole circle of their virtues in himself: And thus he arrives, at length, at the possession of that bright form of Glory , whose ravishing beauty, as seen in a dream or vision, had led him out into these miraculous adventures in the land of Faery. The conclusion is, that, as an allegorical poem, the method of the Faery Queen is governed by the justness of the moral: As a narrative poem, it is conducted on the ideas and usages of chivalry . In either view, if taken by itself, the plan is defensible. But from the union of the two designs there arises a perplexity and confusion, which is the proper, and only considerable, defect of this extraordinary poem. No doubt Spenser might have taken one single adventure, of the Twelve , for the subject of his Poem; or he might have given the principal part in every adventure to P. Arthur. By this means his fable had been of the classic kind, and it's unity as strict as that of Homer and Virgil. All this the poet knew very well, but his purpose was not to write a classic poem. He chose to adorn a gothic story; and, to be consistent throughout, he chose that the form of his work should be of a piece with his subject. Did the Poet do right in this? I cannot tell; but comparing his work with that of another great Poet, who followed the system you seem to recommend, I see no reason to be peremptory in condemning his judgment. The example of this poet deserves to be considered. It will afford, at least, a fresh confirmation of the point, I principally insist upon; I mean, The preeminence of the Gothic manners and fictions, as adapted to the ends of poetry, above the classic. I observed of the famous Torquato Tasso, that, coming into the world a little of the latest for the success of the pure Gothic manner, he thought fit to trim between that and the classic model. It was lucky for his fame, perhaps, that he did so. For the Gothic fables falling every day more and more into contempt, and the learning of the times, throughout all Europe, taking a classic turn, the reputation of his work has been chiefly founded on the strong resemblance it has to the antient epic poems. His fable is conducted in the spirit of the Iliad, and with a strict regard to that unity of action which we admire in Homer and Virgil. But this is not all; we find a studied and close imitation of those poets, in many of the smaller parts, in the minuter incidents, and even in the descriptions and similies of his poem. The classic reader was pleased with this deference to the public taste: he saw with delight the favourite beauties of Homer and Virgil reflected in the Italian poet: and was almost ready to excuse, for the sake of these, his magic tales and faery enchantments. I said, was almost ready ; for the offence given by these to the more fashionable sort of critics was so great, that nothing, I believe, could make full amends, in their judgment, for such extravagancies. However, by this means the Gierusalemme Liberata made it's fortune amongst the French wits, who have constantly cried it up above the Orlando Furioso , and principally for this reason, that Tasso was more classical in his fable, and more sparing in the wonders of Gothic fiction, than his Predecessor. The Italians have indeed a predilection for their elder bard, whether from their prejudice for antiquity; their admiration of his language; the richness of his invention; the comic air of his style and manner; or from whatever other reason. Be this as it will, the French criticism has carried it before the Italian, with the rest of Europe. This dextrous people have found means to lead the taste, as well as set the fashions, of their neighbours: And Ariosto ranks but little higher than the rudest romancer in the opinion of those who take their notions of these things from their writers. But the same principle, which made them give Tasso the preference to Ariosto, has led them by degrees to think very unfavorably of Tasso himself. The mixture of the Gothic manner in his work has not been forgiven. It has sunk the credit of all the rest; and some instances of false taste in the expression of his sentiments, detected, by their nicer critics, have brought matters to that pass, that, with their good will, Tasso himself should now follow the fate of Ariosto. I will not say, that a little national envy did not perhaps mix itself with their other reasons for undervaluing this great poet. They aspired to a sort of supremacy in Letters; and finding the Italian language and it's best writers standing in their way, they have spared no pains to lower the estimation of both. Whatever their inducements were, they succeeded but too well in their attempt. Our obsequious and over modest critics were run down by their authority. Their taste of Letters, with some worse things, was brought amongst us at the Restoration. Their language, their manners, nay their very prejudices were adopted by our Frenchified king and his Royalists. And the more fashionable wits, of course, set their fancies, as my Lord Molesworth tells us the people of Copenhagen in his time did their clocks, by the court-standard. Sir W. Davenant open'd the way to this new sort of criticism in a very elaborate preface to Gondibert; and his philosophic friend, Mr. Hobbes, lent his best assistance towards establishing the credit of it. These two fine Letters contain, indeed, the substance of whatever has been since written on the subject. Succeeding wits and critics did no more than echo their language. It grew into a sort of cant, with which Rymer, and the rest of that School, filled their flimsy essays and rambling prefaces. Our noble critic himself  3 condescended to take up this trite theme: And it is not to be told with what alacrity and self-complacency he flourishes upon it. The Gothic manner , as he calls it, is the favourite object of his raillery; which is never more lively or pointed, than when it exposes that "bad taste which makes us prefer an Ariosto to a Virgil, and a Romance (without doubt he meant, of Tasso) to an Iliad." Truly, this critical sin requires an expiation, which is easily made by subscribing to his sentence, "That the French indeed may boast of legitimate authors of a just relish; but that the Italian are good for nothing but to corrupt the taste of those who have had no familiarity with the noble antients." This ingenious nobleman is, himself, one of the gallant votaries he sometimes makes himself so merry with. He is perfectly enamoured of his noble antients , and will fight with any man who contends, not that his Lordship's mistress is not fair, but that his own is fair also. It is certain the French wits benefited by this foible. For pretending, in great modesty, to have formed themselves on the pure taste of his noble ancients, they easily drew his Lordship over to their party: While the Italians more stubbornly pretending to a taste of their own, and chusing to lye for themselves, instead of adopting the authorized lyes of Greece, were justly exposed to his resentment. Such was the address of the French writers, and such their triumphs over the poor Italians. It must be owned, indeed, they had every advantage on their side, in this contest with their masters. The taste and learning of Italy had been long on the decline, and the fine writers under Louis XIV were every day advancing the French language, such as it is, (simple, clear, exact, that is, fit for business and conversation; but for that reason, besides it's total want of numbers, absolutely unsuited to the genius of the greater poetry) towards it's last perfection. The purity of the antient manner became well understood, and it was the pride of their best critics to expose every instance of false taste in the modern writers. The Italian, it is certain, could not stand so severe a scrutiny. But they had escaped better, if the most fashionable of the French poets had not, at the same time, been their best critic. A lucky word in a verse, which sounds well and every body gets by heart, goes farther than a volume of just criticism. In short, the exact, but cold Boileau happened to say something of the clinquant of Tasso; and the magic of this word, like the report of Astolfo's horn in Ariosto, overturned at once the solid and well built reputation of the Italian poetry. It is not perhaps so amazing that this potent word should do it's business in France. It put us into a fright on this side the water. Mr. Addison, who gave the law in taste here, took it up and sent it about the kingdom in his polite and popular essays. It became a sort of watch-word among the critics; and, on the sudden, nothing was heard, on all sides, but the clinquant of Tasso. After all, these two respectable writers might not intend the mischief they were doing. The observation was just, but was extended much farther than they meant, by their witless followers and admirers. The effect was, as I said, that the Italian poetry was rejected in the gross, by virtue of this censure; tho' the authors of it had said no more than this, "That their best poet had some false thoughts, and dealt, as they supposed, too much in incredible fiction." I leave you to make your own reflexions on this short history of the Italian poetry. It is not my design to make it's apology in all respects. However, with regard to the first of these charges, I presume to say that, as just as it is in the sense in which I persuade myself it was intended, there are more instances of natural sentiment and of that divine simplicity we admire in the antients, even in Guarini's Pastor Fido , than in the best of the French poets. And as to the last , I pretend to shew you, in my next Letter, that it is no fault at all in the Italian poets. CHI non sa che cosa sia Italia? \--- If this question could ever be reasonably asked on any occasion, it must surely be when the wit and poetry of that people were under consideration. The enchanting sweetness of their tongue, the richness of their invention, the fire and elevation of their genius, the splendor of their expression on great subjects, and the native simplicity of their sentiments, on affecting ones; All these are such manifest advantages on the side of the Italian poets, as should seem to command our highest admiration of their great and capital works. Yet a different language has been held by our finer critics. And in particular you hear it commonly said of the tales of Faery, which they first and principally adorned, "That they are unnatural and absurd; that they surpass all bounds not of truth only, but of probability; and look more like the dreams of children, than the manly inventions of poets." All this, and more, has been said; and if truly said, who would not lament L' arte del poetar troppo infelice? For they are not the cold fancies of plebeian poets, but the golden dreams of Ariosto, the celestial visions of Tasso, that are thus derided. The only criticism, indeed, that is worth regarding is, the philosophical. But there is a sort which looks like philosophy, and is not. May not that be the case here? This criticism, whatever name it deserves, supposes that the poets, who are lyars by profession, expect to have their lyes believed. Surely they are not so unreasonable. They think it enough, if they can but bring you to imagine the possibility of them. And how small a matter will serve for this? A legend, a tale, a tradition, a rumour, a superstition; in short, any thing is enough to be the basis of their air-form'd visions . Does any capable reader trouble himself about the truth, or even the credibility of their fancies? Alas, no; he is best pleased when he is made to conceive (he minds not by what magic) the existence of such things as his reason tells him did not, and were never likely to, exist. But here, to prevent mistakes, an explanation will be necessary. We must distinguish between the popular belief , and that of the Reader . The fictions of poetry do, in some degree at least, require the first ; (They would, otherwise, deservedly pass for dreams indeed;) But when the poet has this advantage on his side, and his fancies have, or may be supposed to have, a countenance from the current supersitions of the age, in which he writes, he dispenses with the last , and gives his Reader leave to be as sceptical and as incredulous, as he pleases. An eminent French critic diverts himself with imagining "what a person, who comes fresh from reading Mr. Addison and Mr. Lock, would be apt to think of Tasso's Enchantment  4 ." The English reader will, perhaps, smile at seeing these two writers so coupled together: And, with the critic's leave, we will put Mr. Lock out of the question. But if he be desirous to know what a reader of Mr. Addision would pronounce in the case, I can undertake to give him satisfaction. Speaking of what Mr. Dryden calls, the Faery way of writing , "Men of cold fancies and philosophical dispositions, says he, object to this kind of poetry, that it has not probability enough to affect the imagination. But--- many are prepossessed with such false opinions, as dispose them to believe these particular delusions: At least, we have all hear'd so many pleasing relations in favour of them, that we do not care for seeing thro' the falshood , and willingly give ourselves up to so agreeable an imposture." [ Spect . V. vi.] Apply, now, this sage judgment of Mr. Addison to Tasso's Enchantments , and you see that a falshood convict is not to be pleaded against a supposed belief , or even the slightest hear-say. So little account does this wicked poetry make of philosophical or historical truth: All she allows us to look for, is poetical truth ; a very slender thing indeed, and which the poet's eye, when rolling in it's finest frenzy, can but just lay hold of. To speak in the philosophic language of Mr. Hobbes, It is something much beyond the actual bounds, and only within the conceived possibility, of nature. But the source of bad criticism, as universally of bad philosophy, is the abuse of terms. A poet, they say, must follow Nature ; and by Nature we are to suppose can only be meant the known and experienced course of affairs in this world. Whereas the poet has a world of his own, where experience has less to do, than consistent imagination. He has, besides, a supernatural world to range in. He has Gods, and Faeries, and Witches at his command: And, \---O! who can tell The hidden pow'r of herbes, and might of magic spell? Spenser. B. i. C. 2. Thus in the poet's world, all is marvellous and extraordinary; yet not unnatural in one sense, as it agrees to the conceptions that are readily entertained of these magical and wonder-working Natures. This trite maxim of following Nature is further mistaken in applying it indiscriminately to all sorts of poetry. In those species which have men and manners professedly for their theme, a strict conformity with human nature is reasonably demanded. Non hic Centauros, non Gorgonas, Harpyiasque Invenies: Hominem pagina nostra sapit: is a proper motto to a book of Epigrams, but would make a poor figure at the head of an epic poem. Still further, in those species that address themselves to the heart and would obtain their end, not thro' the Imagination, but thro' the Passions , there the liberty of transgressing nature, I mean the real powers and properties of human nature, is infinitely restrained; and poetical truth is, under these circumstances, almost as severe a thing as historical. The reason is, we must first believe , before we can be affected . But the case is different with the more sublime and creative poetry. This species, addressing itself solely or principally to the Imagination; a young and credulous faculty, which loves to admire and to be deceived; has no need to observe those cautious rules of credibility so necessary to be followed by him, who would touch the affections and interest the heart. This difference, you will say, is obvious enough. How came it then to be overlooked? From another mistake, in extending a particular precept of the drama into a general maxim. The incredulus odi of Horace ran in the heads of these critics, tho' his own words confine the observation singly to the stage. Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quae Ipse sibi tradit Spectator--- That, which passes in representation and challenges, as it were, the scrutiny of the eye, must be truth itself, or something very nearly approaching to it. But what passes in narration , even on the stage, is admitted without much difficulty--- multaque tolles Ex oculis, quae mox narrat facundia praesens. In the epic narration, which may be called absens facundia , the reason of the thing shews this indulgence to be still greater. It appeals neither to the eye nor the ear , but simply to the imagination , and so allows the poet a liberty of multiplying and enlarging his impostures at pleasure, in proportion to the easiness and comprehension of that faculty. These general reflexions hardly require an application to the present subject. The tales of faery are exploded, as fantastic and incredible. They would merit this contempt, if presented on the stage; I mean, if they were given as the proper subject of dramatic imitation, and the interest of the poet's plot were to be wrought out of the adventures of these marvellous persons. But the epic muse runs no risque in giving way to such fanciful exhibitions. You may call them, as one does, "extraordinary dreams, such as excellent poets and painters, by being over studious, may have in the beginning of fevers  5 ." The epic poet would acknowledge the charge, and even value himself upon it. He would say, "I leave to the sage dramatist the merit of being always broad awake, and always in his senses: The divine dream  6 , and delirious fancy, are among the noblest of my prerogatives." But the injustice done the Italian poets does not stop here. The cry is, "Magic and enchantments are senseless things. Therefore the Italian poets are not worth the reading." As if, because the superstitions of Homer and Virgil are no longer believed, their poems, which abound in them, are good for nothing. Yes, you will say, their fine pictures of life and manners--- And may not I say the time, in behalf of Ariosto and Tasso? For it is not true that all is unnatural and monstrous in their poems, because of this mixture of the wonderful. Admit, for example, Armida's marvellous conveyance to the happy Island, and all the rest of the love-story is as natural, that is, as suitable to our common notions of that passion, as any thing in Virgil or (if you will) Voltaire. Thus you see the apology of the Italian poets is easily made on every supposition. But I stick to my point and maintain that the faery tales of Tasso do him more honour than what are called the more natural, that is, the classical parts of his poem. His imitations of the antients have indeed their merit; for he was a genius in every thing. But they are faint and cold and almost insipid, when compared with his original fictions. We make a shift to run over the passages he has copied from Virgil. We are all on fire amidst the magical feats of Ismen, and the enchantments of Armida. Magnanima mensogna, hor quando e il vero Si bello, che si possa a te preporre? I speak at least for myself; and must freely own, if it were not for these Lyes of Gothic invention, I should scarcely be disposed to give the Gierusalemme Liberata a second reading. I readily agree to the lively observation, "That impenetrable armour, inchanted castles, invulnerable bodies, iron men, flying horses, and other such things, are easily feigned by them that dare  7 ." But, with the observer's leave, not so feigned as we find them in the Italian poets, unless the writer have another quality, besides that of courage. One thing is true, that the success of these fictions will not be great, when they have no longer any footing in the popular belief: And the reason is, that readers do not usually do, as they ought, put themselves in the circumstances of the poet, or rather of those, of whom the poet writes. But this only shews, that some ages are not so fit to write epic poems in, as others; not, that they should be otherwise written. It is also true, that writers do not succeed so well in painting what they have heard, as what they believe themselves, or at least observe in others a facility of believing. And on this account I would advise no modern poet to revive these faery tales in an epic poem. But still this is nothing to the case in hand, where we are considering the merit of epic poems, written under other circumstances. The pagan Gods, and Gothic Faeries were equally out of credit, when Milton wrote. He did well therefore to supply their room with angels and devils. If these too should wear out of the popular creed (and they seem in a hopeful way, from the liberty some late critics have taken with them) I know not what other expedients the epic poet might have recourse to; but this I know, the pomp of verse, the energy of description, and even the finest moral paintings would stand him in no stead. Without admiration (which cannot be effected but by the marvellous of celestial intervention, I mean, the agency of superior natures really existing, or by the illusion of the fancy taken to be so) no epic poem can be long-lived. I am not afraid to instance in the Henriade itself; which, notwithstanding the elegance of the composition, will in a short time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W. Davenant, and for the same reason. Critics may talk what they will of Truth and Nature , and abuse the Italian poets, as they will, for transgressing both in their incredible fictions. But believe it, my friend, these fictions with which they have studied to delude the world, are of that kind of creditable deceits, of which a wise antient pronounces with assurance, " That they, who deceive, are honester than they who do not deceive; and they, who are deceived, wiser than they who are not deceived. " BUT you are weary of hearing so much of these exploded fancies; and are ready to ask, if there be any truth in this representation, "Whence it has come to pass, that the classical manners are still admired and imitated by the poets, when the Gothic have long since fallen into disuse? The answer to this question will furnish all that is now wanting to a proper discussion of the present subject. of Greece ennobled the system of heroic manners, while it was fresh and flourishing; and their works, being master-pieces of composition, so fixed the credit of it in the opinion of the world, that no revolutions of time and taste could afterwards shake it. Whereas the Gothic having been disgraced in their infancy by bad writers, and a new set of manners springing up before there were any better to do them justice, they could never be brought into vogue by the attempts of later poets; who, in spite of prejudice, and for the genuine charm of these highly poetical manners, did their utmost to recommend them. But, FURTHER , the Gothic system was not only forced to wait long for real genius to do it honour; real genius was even very early employed against it. There were two causes of this mishap. The old romancers had even outraged the truth in their extravagant pictures of chivalry: And Chivalry itself, such as it once had been, was greatly abated. So that men of sense were doubly disgusted to find a representation of things unlike to what they observed in real life, and beyond what it was ever possible should have existed. However, with these disadvantages there was still so much of the old spirit left, and the fascination of these wondrous tales was so prevalent, that a more than common degree of sagacity and good sense was required to penetrate the illusion. It was one of this character, I suppose, that put the famous question to Ariosto, which has been so often repeated that I shall spare you the disgust of hearing it. Yet long before his time an immortal genius of our own (so superior is the sense of some men to the age they live in) saw as far into this matter, as Ariosto's examiner. This sagacious person was Dan Chaucer; who, in a reign that almost realized the wonders of romantic chivalry, not only discerned the absurdity of the old romances, but has even ridiculed them with incomparable spirit. His Rime on Sir Topaz , in the Canterbury tales, is a manifest banter on these books, and may be considered as a sort of prelude to the adventures of Don Quixot. I call it a manifest banter: For we are to observe that this was Chaucer's own tale, and that, when in the progress of it the good sense of the Host is made to break in upon him, and interrupt him, Chaucer approves his disgust and, changing his note, tells the simple instructive tale of Meliboeus, a moral tale virtuous , as he chuses to characterize it; to shew, what sort of fictions were most expressive of real life, and most proper to be put into the hands of the people. One might further observe that the Rime of Sir Topaz itself is so managed as with infinite humour to expose the leading impertinences of books of chivalry, and their impertinencies only; as may be seen by the different conduct of this tale, from that of Cambuscan, which Spenser and Milton were so pleased with, and which with great propriety is put into the mouth of the Squire . But I must not anticipate the observations which you will take a pleasure to make for yourself on these two fine parts of the Canterbury tales. Enough is said to illustrate the point, I am now upon, "That these phantoms of chivalry had the misfortune to be laughed out of countenance by men of sense, before the substance of it had been fairly and truly represented by any capable writer." manners of Chivalry, as springing out of the feudal system, were as singular, as that system itself: So that, when that political constitution vanished out of Europe, the manners, that belonged to it, were no longer seen or understood. There was no example of any such manners remaining on the face of the Earth: And as they never did subsist but once, and are never likely to subsist again, people would be led of course to think and speak of them, as romantic, and unnatural. The consequence of which was a total contempt and rejection of them; while the classic manners, as arising out of the customary and usual situations of humanity, would have many archetypes, and appear natural even to those who saw nothing similar to them actually subsisting before their eyes. Thus, tho' the manners of Homer are perhaps as different from ours, as those of Chivalry itself, yet as we know that such manners always belong to rude and simple ages, such as Homer paints; and actually subsist at this day in countries that are under the like circumstances of barbarity, we readily agree to call them natural , and even take a fond pleasure in the survey of them. Your question then is easily answered, without any obligation upon me to give up the Gothic manners as visionary and fantastic. And the reason appears, why the Faery Queen , one of the noblest productions of modern poetry, is fallen into so general a neglect, that all the zeal of it's commentators is esteemed officious and impertinent, and will never restore it to those honours which it has, once for all, irrecoverably lost. In effect, what way of persuading the generality of readers that the romantic manners are to be accounted natural , when not one in ten thousand knows enough of the barbarous ages, in which they arose, to believe they ever really existed? Poor Spenser then, \--- --- --- ---"in whose gentle spright The pure well-head of Poesie did dwell," must, for ought I can see, be left to the admiration of a few lettered and curious men: While the many are sworn together to give no quarter to the marvellous , or, which may seem still harder, to the moral of his song. However, this great revolution in modern taste was brought about by degrees; and the steps, that led to it, may be worth the tracing in a distinct Letter. THE wonders of Chivalry were still in the memory of men, were still existing, in some measure, in real life, when Chaucer undertook to expose the barbarous relaters of them. This ridicule, we may suppose, hastened the fall both of Chivalry and Romance. At least from that time the spirit of both declined very fast, and at length fell into such discredit, that when now Spenser arose, and with a genius singularly fitted to immortalize the land of faery, he met with every difficulty and disadvantage to obstruct his design. The age would no longer bear the naked letter of these amusing stories; and the poet was so sensible of the misfortune, that we find him apologizing for it on a hundred occasions. But apologies, in such circumstances, rarely do any good. Perhaps, they only served to betray the weakness of the poet's cause, and to confirm the prejudices of his reader. However, he did more than this. He gave an air of mystery to his subject, and pretended that his stories of knights and giants were but the cover to abundance of profound wisdom. In short, to keep off the eyes of the prophane from prying too nearly into his subject, he threw about it the mist of allegory: he moralized his song: and the virtues and vices lay hid under his warriours and enchanters. A contrivance which he had learned indeed from his Italian masters: For Tasso had condescended to allegorize his own work; and the commentators of Ariosto had even converted the extravagances of the Orlando Furioso, into moral lessons. And this, it must be owned, was a sober attempt in comparison of some projects that were made about the same time to serve the cause of the old, and now expiring Romances. For it is to be observed, that the idolizers of these romances did by them, what the votaries of Homer had done by him. As the times improved and would less bear his strange tales, they moralized what they could, and turn'd the rest into mysteries of natural science . And as this last contrivance was principally designed to cover the monstrous stories of the pagan Gods , so it served the lovers of Romance to palliate the no less monstrous stories of magic and enchantments . The editor, or translator of the 24th book of Amadis de Gaule , printed at Lyons in 1577, has a preface explaining the whole secret, which concludes with these words, "Voyla, Lecteur, le  FRUIT , qui se peut recueiller du sens mystique des Romans antiques par les ESPRITS ESLEUS , le commun peuple soy contentant de la SIMPLE FLEUR DE LA LECTURE LITERALE . But to return to Spenser; who, as we have seen, had no better way to take in his distress, than to hide his faery fancies under the mystic cover of moral allegory. The only favourable circumstance that attended him (and this no doubt encouraged, if it did not produce his untimely project) was, that he was somewhat befriended in these fictions, even when interpreted according to the Letter, by the romantic Spirit of his age; much countenanced, and for a time brought into fresh credit, by the romantic Elizabeth. Her inclination for the fancies of Chivalry is well known; and obsequious wits and courtiers would not be wanting to feed and flatter it. In short, tilts and tournaments were in vogue: The Arcadia, and the Faery Queen were written. With these helps the new Spirit of Chivalry made a shift to support itself for a time, when reason was but dawning, as we may say, and just about to gain the ascendant over the portentous spectres of the imagination. It's growing splendour, in the end, put them all to flight, and allowed them no quarter even amongst the poets. So that Milton, as fond as we have seen he was of the Gothic fictions, durst only admit them on the bye, and in the way of simile and illustration only. And this, no doubt, was the main reason of his relinquishing his long- projected design of Prince Arthur, at last, for that of the Paradise Lost; where, instead of Giants and Magicians, he had Angels and Devils to supply him with the marvellous , with greater probability. Yet, tho' he dropped the tales, he still kept to the allegories of Spenser. And even this liberty was thought too much, as appears from the censure passed on his Sin and Death by the severer critics. Thus at length the magic of the old romances was perfectly dissolved. They began with reflecting an image indeed of the feudal manners, but an image magnified and distorted by unskilful designers. Common sense being offended with these perversions of truth and nature (still accounted the more monstrous, as the antient manners, they pretended to copy after, were now disused, and of most men forgotten) the next step was to have recourse to allegories . Under this disguise they walked the world a while; the excellence of the moral and the ingenuity of the contrivance making some amends, and being accepted as a sort of apology, for the absurdity of the literal story. Under this form the tales of faery kept their ground, and even made their fortune at court; where they became, for two or three reigns, the ordinary entertainment of our princes. But reason, in the end, (assisted however by party, and religious prejudices) drove them off the scene, and would endure these lying wonders , neither in their own proper shape, nor as masked in figures. Henceforth, the taste of wit and poetry took a new turn: And fancy, that had wantoned it so long in the world of fiction, was now constrained, against her will, to ally herself with strict truth, if she would gain admittance into reasonable company. What we have gotten by this revolution, you will say, is a great deal of good sense. What we have lost, is a world of fine fabling; the illusion of which is so grateful to the charmed Spirit ; that, in spite of philosophy and fashion, Faery Spenser still ranks highest among the Poets; I mean with all those who are either come of that house, or have any kindness for it. Earth-born critics, my friend, may blaspheme, "But all the Gods are ravish'd with delight Of his celestial Song, and music's wondrous might." The END.
