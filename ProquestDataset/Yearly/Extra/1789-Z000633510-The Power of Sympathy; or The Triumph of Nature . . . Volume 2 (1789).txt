I SEND you a little work, entitled " A Lady of Quality's Advice to her Children  " which, though not altogether free from this exception, is highly worthy of your attention. A parent who is repre[s]ented [s]truggling with the di[s]tre[s]s of a lingering illne[s]s, bequeaths a [s]y[s]tem of education to her offspring. I do not recommend it to you as a Novel, but as a work that [s]peaks the language of the heart and that inculcates the duty we owe to ourselves, to [s]ociety and the Deity.

THIS affectation of fine breeding is destru ctive to morals. Di[s][s]imulation and insincerity are connected with its tenets; and are mutually inculcated with the art of pleasing. A PERSON of this character grounds his motives for plea[s]ing on the mo[s]t [s]elfi[s]h principle---He is polite, not for the honour of obliging you, as he endeavours to make you believe, but that he him[s]elf might be obliged.

I never anticipate your future happine[s]s, but I contemplate this part of his character with plea[s]ure.

I think you are enabled to perform this, becau[s]e you are [s]olicitous to supply your mind with tho[s]e amiable qualities which are more durable than beauty.

Reflection is a kind of relaxation from frolicking--- it encourages the progre[s]s of virtue, and upholds the heart from [s]inking to depravity. WE may lay it down as a principle, that that conduct which will bear the te[s]t of reflection, and which creates a plea[s]ure in the mind from a con[s]iou[s]ne[s]s of acting right, is virtuous: And [s]he who[s]e conduct will not bear this te[s]t, is nece[s][s]arily degenerating, and [s]he is assenting to her de[s]truction [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] LET a lady be liberal or even magnificent, according to her circum[s]tances or [s]ituation in life; but let the heart remain uncorrupt, let her not be contaminated by wealth, ambition or [s]plendour.

HAPPY they who can thus reflect---who can recal to view the [s]cenes that are pa[s][s]ed, and behold their actions with reiterated satisfaction--- they become ambitious of excelling in everything virtuous, becau[s]e they are certain of [s]ecuring a continual reward: For as a mighty river fertilizes the country through which it pa[s][s]es and encrea[s]es in magnitude and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] force until it empty it[s]elf into the ocean: So virtue fertilizes or improves the heart, and gathers [s]trength and vigour by continual progre[s][s]ion, until it centre in the consummation of its de[s]ires. DAZZLED by the glitter of [s]plendour, and unmindful of the real charms of economy and [s]implicity, the female heart [s]ighs for the enjoyment of fa[s]hion, and flutters to join the motley train of plea[s]ure. But how is it deluded by empty deceptions! Like the fruit which [s]prang up in the infernal regions, beautiful to the eye, but which left upon the ta[s]te bitter a[s]hes, and was followed by repentance--- A great quantity of this kind of fruit pre[s]ents it[s]elf to my ra[s]hly judging [s]ex; and it frequently happens that their hearts [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] have as little inclination to re[s]i[s]t the temptation, as our general parent to refu[s]e the fatal apple. WE do not rou[s]e to our aid fortitude to enable us to [s]urmount the temptation, but yield our[s]elves to a kind of voluntary [s]lavery. Hence it is ob[s]ervable, that a woman is often unhappy in the mid[s]t of plea[s]ures---and petulent without cau[s]e---that [s]he is trifling in matters of the highe[s]t importance; and the mo[s]t momentous concern is con[s]idered futile, as whim and caprice may chance to dictate.

She finds her[s]elf di[s]appointed, and is mortified.

Thus terminates the career of a woman, who[s]e mind is debilitated, and who[s]e life is expended in the pur[s]uit of vanity. IT is [s]aid of [s]ome [s]pecies of American serpents, that they have the power of charming birds and [s]mall animals, which they de[s]tine for their prey. The [s]erpent is [s]tretched underneath a tree---it looks [s]tedfa[s]tly on the bird---their eyes meet to [s]eparate no more--- the charm begins to operate---the fascinated bird flutters and hops from limb to limb, till unable any longer to extend its wings, it falls into the voracious jaws of its enemy: This is no ill emblem of the fa[s]cinating power of plea[s]ure.

We may, however, ob[s]erve on the contrary, that a woman who advances a few [s]teps, often hurries on [s]till further to prevent thought. This bars the way to a return to that conduct which can give plea[s]ure on recollection. She behaves to her[s]elf as the populace did formerly to women [s]u[s]pected of witchcraft---they were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] tied neck and heels and thrown into the river; if they [s]wam they were hung for witches---if they [s]ank they were acquitted of the crime, but drowned in the experiment: So when we only [s]u[s]pect our hearts of an errour, we plunge [s]till deeper into the [s]ea of di[s][s]ipation, to prevent the trial of that condu ct which impartial rea[s]on and judgment would approve. notwithstanding I give this in[s]tance as an encouragement for virtue; yet in all tho[s]e I have mentioned is a woman acce[s][s]ary to her ruin. DO not imagine, my dear Myra , that I mean to argue again[s]t all plea[s]ure---Many of us [s]et out on a principle of fal[s]e delicacy and destru ctive rival[s]hip; we cannot behold a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] fine woman without wi[s]hing to appear finer. A laudable emulation in the conduct of all women is extremely prai[s]eworthy---it stimulates them in the line of their duty---increa[s]es vivacity and good humour; and ambition, thus directed and pur[s]ued, I beg leave to designate a female virtue, becau[s]e it is productive of the mo[s]t happy con[s]equences. BUT it [s]ometimes happens that particular virtues loo[s]e them[s]elves in their neighbouring vices, and this laudable emulation degererates into de[s]tructive rival[s]hip. A GENTEEL, hand[s]ome woman, deservedly [s]hares the e[s]teem and admiration of all men; but why [s]hould this e[s]teem and admiration, ju[s]tly paid to merit, give us difquiet? the an[s]wer is ready.

THIS may po[s][s]ibly give ri[s]e to defamation. It is a[s]toni[s]hing how this practice prevails among a few per[s]ons---becau[s]e it is known by experience, to prove [s]ubver[s]ive of its very intention.---The arrows of envy recoil upon her[s]elf.

She rai[s]es up the dykes of ill nature, and inundates the land with a flood of [s]candal, but unhappily drowns her[s]elf in the event.

SHE had gained a [s]i[s]ter---[s]he had lo[s]t a lover---a bur[s]t of joy would [s]uddenly break from her, but it was of [s]hort duration---and was [s]ucceeded by pangs of exqui[s]ite di[s]tre[s]s--- nature was unable to [s]upport it, and [s]he [s]ainted under the weight of the [s]evere confli ct.

As I reflect on the[s]e [s]cenes of infantine ignorance, I feel my heart intere[s]ted, and become [s]en[s]ibly affected---and however [s]utile the[s]e feelings may appear as I communicate them [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] to you---they are feelings I venture to affert which every one mu[s]t have experienced who is po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of a heart of [s]en[s]ibility.

"The[s]e," [s]aid my guide, "who are scourged with a whip of [s]corpions, and who [s]tart with horrour at the reflection of their deeds upon earth, are the fouls of the Gambler--- the Prodigal---the Dueli[s]t, and the Ingrate.

EARLY this morning I was [s]urpri[s]ed with a vi[s]it from a gentleman, whom I had formerly [s]een at Myra 's---it was the [s]ame neighbour who informed Harrington of his affinity to Harriot \---he found a difficulty in his utterance---he told me, with trembling lips, my young friend Harrington was dead--- "He has killed him[s]elf," [s]aid I---he a[s]ked me if I had heard the news---I told him my heart pre[s]aged it.

A few friends were reque[s]ted to attend---and this gentleman had called upon me, by defire of Myra . IT is not po[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe the di[s]trefs of the family and connexions---I [s]hall leave it to your imagination. A LETTER that he had written for me, laid unfealed upon the table, and The Sorrows of Werter  was found lying by its [s]ide, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-319.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] I [s]end you the letter---it appears to have been written at intervals, and expre[s][s]es the di[s]order and agitation of his mind. Adieu! HARRINGTON to WORTHY. Harriot is dead---and the world to me is a dreary defert---I prepare to leave it---the [s]atal pi[s]tol is charged---it lies on the table by me, ready to perform its duty---but that duty is delayed till I take my la[s]t farewel of the be[s]t of friends. YOUR letter is written with the impetuosity of an hone[s]t heart; it expre[s][s]es great [s]incerity and tenderne[s]s.

[s]he is dead--- [s]he is gone---never to return, never again to cheer my heart with her [s]miles and her amiable manners---her image is always before me---and can I forget her?---No!--- She is continually haunting my mind, impressing the imagination with ideas of excellence---but [s]he is dead---all that delighted me is become torpid---is de[s]cended into the cold grave. With thee Certain my refolution is to die; How can I live without thee---how forego Thy converfe [s]weet, and love [s]o dearly join'd, To live again in the[s]e wild woods forlorn? lo[s]s of thee Will never from my heart---no! no!---I feel The link of nature draw me. From thy [s]tate Mine never [s]hall be parted, bli[s]s or woe.

SHE mentioned the name of Worthy , but my thoughts were differently engaged. She repeated your name, but I took no heed of it.---Take her, my Worthy---Myra is a good girl---take her---comfort her. Let not my departure interrupt your happine[s]s--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-322.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] perhaps it may for a [s]hort time. When the gra[s]s is grown over my grave, lead her to it, in your pen[s]ive walks---point to the [s]pot where my a[s]hes are depo[s]ited---drop one tear on the remembrance of a friend, of a brother--- but I cannot allow you to be grieved--- grieve for me! Wretch that I am---why do I delay--- \---I WISH I could be buried by the [s]ide of her, then [s]hould the pa[s][s]enger who knows the hi[s]tory of our unfortunate loves, [s]ay---" Here lies Harrington and his Harriot \--- in their lives they loved, but were unhappy--- in death they [s]leep undivided."--- Gaurdian [s]pirits will protect the tomb which conceals her body---the body where every virtue delighted to inhabit.--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-323.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] DO not judge too ra[s]hly of my conduct--- let me pray you to be candid---I have taken advantage of a quiet moment, and written an Epitaph---If my body were laid by her's, the in[s]cription would be pertinent.

Great numbers crouded to [s]ee the body of poor Harrington ; they were impressed with various emotions, for their sympathizing [s]orrow could not be concealed---Indeed a man without [s]en[s]ibility exhibits no [s]ign of a [s]oul. I was [s]truck with admiration at the ob[s]ervations of the populace, and the justness of the character they drew of the deceased. "Alas!" [s]aid one---"poor youth, thou art gone. Thou wa[s]t of a promi[s]ing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v2T&image=034-325.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] genius, of violent pa[s][s]ions, thou wa[s]t possesied of a too nice [s]en[s]ibility, and a dread of [s]hame.

We con[s]ider thee as the dupe of Nature, and the [s]acrifice of Seduction."---The old father hears this, and becomes overwhelmed with [s]hame and [s]orrow. THE jury which [s]at upon the body of our friend, after mature con[s]ideration, brought in their verdict SUICIDE. The rigour of the law was not executed---the body was privately taken away, and I [s]aw it depo[s]ited by the [s]ide of his faithful Harriot .

I found it with many loo[s]e papers. It contains the [s]tory of our unfortunate friends, and a profitable moral is deduced from it. THOUGH a few weeks begin to [s]pread a oalm over our pa[s][s]ions, yet the recollection of our misfortunes will [s]ometimes cau[s]e a momentary agitation, as the ocean retains its [s]well, after the [s]torm [s]ub[s]ides.

And Sympathy unites, whom Fate divides. They [s]ee---they love---but heav'n their pa[s][s]ion tries Their love [s]u[s]tains it, but their mortal dies. Stranger! contemplate well before you part, And take this [s]erious coun[s]el to thy heart Does [s]ome fair female of un[s]potted fame, Salute thee, [s]miling, with a father's name, Bid her dete[s]t the fell Seducer's wiles, Who [s]miles to win---and murders as he [s]miles. If ever wandering near this dark rece[s]s, Where gaurdian [s]pirits round the ether pre[s]s; Where, on their urn, cele[s]tial care de[s]cends, Two lovers come, whom fair [s]ucce[s]s attends, "O'er the pale marble [s]hall they join their heads, "And drink the falling tears each other [s]heds "Then [s]adly [s]ay, with mutual pity mov'd, "0! may we never love as the[s]e have lov'd."
