J. H. DUGANNE. `Mick, avourneen , ye're goin', shure?' `Och, tak' another dhrop, an'be aisy! It's a bad night, it is.' `Faix! it's a long road, and a bad one, avick .' These expostulatory sentences were volubly poured out by a circle of brawny sons of the sod, seated in the ingle of the snug little tap-room of Ballinshally, to a stout, jovial-looking young farmer, who, with a brimming mug of potheen in one hand, and a thick, iron-bound whip-handle grasped tightly in the other, stood near the door, leering with a pair of comical little eyes at the buxom landlady within the bar. `Hould yer tongues, the whole uv yez.--- Throth, an'isn't it Fair-day the mornin', an' the dumb bastes, an' the childer, an' the ould woman to be lookin' afther, ye onconsiderate spalpeens? Shure, it 'ud look like Mick Teenan to be late, and the Murphys an' O'Keegans to the fore. Get out wid yez!' `Arrah, Mick, tak' my advice,' said the rosy-cheeked landlady, bustling forward and taking hold of the whip which the young farmer grasped. `For the sake of your blissed sowl, don't go home the night. Shure, don't ye mind the ugly sperit that sits at the Ford o' Darrochdyle? Och, it's the night uv all others in the year that the sperit has power to hurt thravellers. Throth, it's flyin' in the face o' rayson, to pass that same place, an' not a leprighawn to say good luck till ye.' `Ye might as well be afther savin' yer breath to blow the fire, Misthress Carney,' replied the young man, snatching away the whip, and giving it a sudden twirl around his head that made the lash crack like a pistol. `I'll go home to-night if all the sperits in Connemara stood fornenst me. So jist ordher Pat Mulligan to bring "Norah Creen" to the door, and here's a stirrup-cup to the whole uv ye. Hooroo!' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf088&image=088-004.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] And with a sudden jerk of the head backwards, as he applied the whiskey to his lips, the young man swallowed its steaming contents at a draught, and deposited the empty vessel upside down upon the bar. The gossips in the chimney-corner shook their heads in silent reprobation of the young farmer's foolhardiness, and the landlady disappeared from the bar, to give orders to Pat Mulligan, the red-headed hostler. In a few moments Norah Creen, the little black mare which Mick Teenan averred was worth her weight `in goold,' was led round to the door of the cabin, and Mick himself, buttoning his coat closer to his throat, and giving his top-boots an encouraging hitch, bade `goodby' to the occupants of the snug ingle, in spite of their renewed entreaties that he would not attempt his lonesome journey home. `Ye're detarmined, thin, Mick Teenan,' said an old man who occupied the warmest spot, removing his short dudheen from between his lips, with a deprecating puff of smoke, `ye're detarmined to leave us?' `Divil smoder me if I'm not, Phil Darley, an' that's no small oath.' `Thin hearken to me, avourneen , an' go round by Pat Doyle's mill, an' don't pass the Ford o'Darrochdyle. It's no far out uv yer way, an' by that means ye'll chate the sperit .' Before Mick Teenan could reply to this adjuration of the old man, a sudden peal of thunder shook the walls of the frail roadside-tavern, and a flash of lightning glimmered through the windows. `Whillaloo! what's that?' exclaimed another of the party, starting to his feet, as the dismal reverberations died away in the distance. `Howly vargin, what a crash!' The door of the tap-room opened, and the carroty head of Pat Mulligan, the hostler, appeared in the aperture. His face was white as chalk, and from his coarse canvass jacket the rain streamed in a score of little rivulets. He beckoned nervously to the young farmer. `Misther Teenan, Norah's conductin' hersilf very onkindly,' said he. `Divil a bit will she be aisy at all, plase ye, sir.' The next moment a shrill neigh from without attested the truth of Pat Mulligan's deposition. The bar-room occupants crowded to the door, cautiously protruding their heads, with due deference to the big drops of rain pattering from the eaves; and Mick Teenan seized the head of his restive mare. `Who towld ye to tie the crathur, ye omadhown? ' cried the young man, angrily, as he hastily unfastened the bridle which the hostler had hitched to a post. `Norah Creen's like her masther---she'll niver be continted widout her fraydom. But, good luck to all uv ye, till we meet again, and don't throuble yersilves about Mick Teenan.' So saying, and with another crack of his whip, the young farmer sprang upon Norab Creen's back; and then with a loud `hooroo,' put spurs to the animal, and trotted off into the stormy darkness. The buxom landlady and her customers remained at the door as long as the departing hoofs could be heard in the distance, and then returned, with anxious faces and many misgivings, to the ingle-side, there to speculate upon the rashness of youth, and to refresh each other's memories by the recapitulation of a hundred legends of `Petticoat-Loose, ' `The Spirit of the Ford,' and all the calendar of Irish ghosts and hobgoblins. All who have travelled in the south of Ireland, if they have mingled at all with the peasantry, must be familiar with the numberless marvellous tales that are recited concerning the celebrated ` Petticoat-Loose ,' an evil spirit, whose destiny, according to popular tradition, is to inflict harm upon rash or wicked mortals during a term of centuries in which she expiates an ill-spent life. It may be well to remark, in this place, that it is a popular belief among the peasantry of the south of Ireland, that the purgatory which is apportioned to many who die in sin, is often located near the scene of their carthly crimes. In other words, it is supposed that the spirit of a bad person, after his bodily death, remains upon the earth, wandering up and down, continually suffering, and constrained to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf088&image=088-005.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] perform certain acts which are at the same time its punishment and the means of expiating the sins of a former life. For instance, one spirit is believed to haunt the spot where a cruel murder was perpetrated, and there its terrible destiny is to waylay and murder certain individuals who are sent and delivered into its relentless hands. Others, again, are compelled to remain, viewless and disembodied, between the heaven and earth, witnessing with the keenest pangs the miseries and crimes of their friends and descendants on the earth, and remorsefully conscious that they have been the cause of all by their own sins committed while in mortal life. `Petticoat-Loose' was, as the belief runs, once a beautiful maiden, who, in her life-time, was cursed with a violent and ungovernable temper. In her height of passion, she would attack and maltreat an aged mother, beating her shamefully, until the poor old woman sank beneath her blows, and prayed that God would punish her wicked child. Then the right arm of the young woman became endued with immense strength, and as the story goes, increased in weight to several tons. Whoever she struck, or even laid her hand on, was crushed immediately, and thus she destroyed not only her mother, but also her lover and many of her friends, until at last every one fled from her, and she perished miserably, bearing her heavy arm down with her to the grave. But her punishment was not even then complete. While her body mouldered in the common resting-place of good and bad mortals, the spirit of the wicked daughter remained near the scenes of her living crimes, and the dreadful weight which had been the instrument of her earthly penance, still remained in her uncorporeal arm. The curse still clung to her, and she was condemned for thousands of years to linger upon the earth, and be the medium of destruction to sinful mortals. She was to sit upon a ruined wall, or in some lonely spot, and there, at certain seasons, power was given her to crush with her fearful hand the unfortunate traveller who should cross her path. This is one version of the story of `Petticoat-Loose; ' and infinite are the marvellous stories connected with the exercise of her evil power. The traditions concerning `The Spirit of the Ford' are somewhat different, but the same unholy destiny is prescribed to her--- to destroy human life. Her usual place of resort was the `Ford of Darrochdyle,' where, on a particular night in the year, her evil power was fatal to all who approached the haunted stream. And it was upon this unlucky night, that our headstrong young farmer, Mick Teenan, had resolved, malgre the advice of his friends, to leave the comfortable tap-room of Mistress Carney, and betake himself to his lonesome homeward journey. For sometime after leaving the tavern door, the little black mare, Norah Creen, dashed on through the storm at the very top of her speed, and Mick, into whose brain the fume of potheen had ascended, was in a most blessed state of indifference as to whether it was midnight or noonday. Norah was familiar with the road; and her master, sitting firmly in his saddle, and grasping the reins, indulged himself in all the amusing fancies and corresponding actions, which a `drop too much' is calculated to inspire. He cracked his whip about his head, shouted `hooroo' in answer to the thunderpeals, and trolled snatches of every old balled he could call to mind, to the accompaniment of his mare's hoof-strokes. Mick was as happy and uproarous as Tam O'Shanter, before he reached Kirk Alloway. But as the potent exhilarator, potheen , began to lose its virtue under the cold rain which now was soaking through the young man's garments, so Mick's ebullitions of mirth began sensibly to decrease. His whip-snaps subsided into a sober waving of the lash, his `hooroo' no longer emulated the thunder, and even his musical talents were now only developed by a few sepulchral attempts to whistle `St. Patrick's Day in the Morning.' And as the effects of Mistress Carney's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf088&image=088-006.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] whiskey declined, Mick Teenan began to reflect, and very soon arrived at the conclusion, that he was not so comfortable as he had previously supposed himself to be. His great coat, he became aware, clung to his body with a weight and coldness that satisfied him of its being pretty well saturated with Irish fog. Norah's flanks were smoking with the exertion of her long gallop, and the little mare was now indulging herself in a leisurely amable. The rain had ceased, to be sure, but the clouds still hung heavy overhead, and the road was dark and gloomy, and moreover broken and miry, so that poor Norah was compelled either to pick her way most delicately, or to run the risk of sinking fetlock, if not girth deep, in some unlucky bog-spots. Mick Teenan's thoughts began to lose the couleur de rose  with which potheen had painted them. And as the power of the `spirit of whiskey' departed, the power of `The Spirit of the Ford' began to fill his mind with uncomfortable images. He began to recall, one by one, the thousand stories he had heard in his childhood of the baleful doings of this Darrochdyle fiend, and of the numberless unhappy wights who had been known to set forth upon the same road which he was himself journeying, but who never returned to tell their anxious friends of their adventures. He remembered how the parish-priest, Father Mulrooney (`God rest his sowl,' murmured Mick; `he's dead now), had walked along by the Ford one Sunday night, with cross and book in hand, to exorcise the evil spirit, and how the good father had heard wild, unearthly shrieks whenever he sprinkled the holy water about him. He recollected, too, how Will Carey, the miller's son, who never feared man nor beast, had gone out with a stout crab-stick to the Ford, swearing by this and by that, to have a game of single-stick with the ` sperit; ' and how the poor boy had been found next morning drowned in the stream, and his crab-stick, the only token, broken to small bits, and lying by the Ford. All these reminiscences, it may be imagin ed, were scarcely calculated to enhance the agreeableness of Mick's situation, wet to the skin as he was, and trotting over a muddy road, at the `witching hour' of one of the darkest and dreariest nights laid down in the almanac. He could hardly refrain from picturing to himself the comforts of Mistress Carney's tap-room, and it is not to be wondered at if he wished himself back there, or if he mentally accused himself of having done a very foolish thing in leaving such snug quarters. In fact, poor Mick, as he peered forward into the darkness, and thought of Darrochdyle, almost pulled the rein of his little mare to turn her back towards the roadside-tavern. But the apprehension of the well-merited ridicule to which he would be exposed, should he return to Mistress Carney's, after his vaporing departure, checked his hand. Beside, he was already more than half way home; and, after passing the Ford, the road was direct and good. But the Ford itself---there was `the rub.' Poor Mick, as he neared the haunted vicinity, began to feel strange misgivings. Once he thought of the advice of old Phil Darley, at the tavern, to go round by the mill, and thus escape the dreaded pass. But, then, to do that, he must retrace his steps nearly to the point where he started, and afterwards pursue a roundabout and lengthy course which would keep him on the road the entire night, and completely `beat up' poor Norah Creen for the next day. At last Mick Teenan, like a true Irishman, came to the conclusion that the safest way to get round danger was to go straight through it, and so, mustering his courage for the emergency, he gave a `chirrup' to encourage Norah, cracked his whip to embolden himself, and away went mare and master in a smart canter over the road, towards the Ford of Darrochdyle. The clouds were now beginning to break away, and a few small patches of clear sky were straggling out from the driving masses of darkness. It was evident that the storm was completely over, and that the latter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf088&image=088-007.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] portion of the night would be starlight. This tended somewhat to lighten Mick's apprehension, as it assured him that if the `sperit' was visible at all, he could see her better with the aid of a little light, and so he might have time to ` rayson with her ,' as he pleasantly, though rather feebly, remarked to himself. But at this moment Norah Creen, the black mare, suddenly stopped short in her canter, and Mick Teenan was well-nigh thrown bodily over head. `What the divil do ye mane by that? ' cried Mick, apostrophizing his mare, as he recovered his seat in the saddle. Norah Creen answered with a shrill neigh, and planting her fore-hoofs wide apart, stretched out her nostrils and began to snuff the air. `Tunder and turf, what are ye at?' cried Mick. `Don't swear, Michael Teenan!' said a voice, which seemed to proceed from some one by his side. But he saw nothing. The mare's eyes, however, were dilated, and a cold sweat broke from her neck. `Howly vargin presarve us!' ejaculated the young farmer. `Bless yourself three times, Michael Teenan, and you'll see a friend,' said the voice. Mick did as he was directed. He crossed himself reverently thrice, shutting his eyes all the time. When he opened them at last, he beheld a white horse standing beside his own black mare. Astride of it sat the figure of a man, and Mick Teenan trembled in every joint, for in the face of that man he recognized that of an old friend long since dead. It was that of Andrew Boyne, at whose death-bed he had himself watched years before in the north of Ireland. `Do you know me, Michael?' asked the stranger. `I do, Andrew Boyne! In the name of God, what are you?' `I am a spirit, Michael, and I have learned this night that the life of an old friend was in peril. I have come from the far off north to save you, Michael Teenan. And now I say to you, go back from this place.' Mick had been gazing in the face of him who had been his friend, and a strange feeling had come over him. The fear which had at first oppressed him was gone, and it seemed as if he were face to face with the living instead of the dead. `You have come to save me, Andrew,' said he, `what must I go back for?' `The Spirit of the Ford of Darrochdyle is powerful for evil this night,' answered the strange voice of him of the white horse. `I fear not, Andrew, if you ride with me beyont the Ford.' `That I cannot do,' said the shape, sorrowfully. `Then I will ride alone,' cried Mick Teenan, spurring his mare. But Norah Creen stirred not; she only neighed shrilly. `Michael! you are, as of old, obstinate and headstrong---but, nevertheless, I will save you this night. Listen to me, and obey my words.' And while Mick Teenan, with a strange awe creeping over his heart, watched the countenance of his ghostly friend, the shape drew from its bosom a long, bright-bladed knife, with a black horn handle. `Take this knife,' said the spirit of the north, in a solemn, voice, `place it in your bosom, and ride forward. You will reach the Ford, and there you will behold a woman seated by the water. She will ask you to permit her to ride with you. Speak no word in reply, but draw this knife, and plunge it into her bosom. She will cry to you, `Draw, and strike again!' but as you value your life, heed her not; for if you draw the weapon she will regain her strength and destroy you. But spur your horse, Michael Teenan, and spare not whip nor rein. You ride for your life; and either you or your horse, or both, must die to-night.' Mick Teenan heard the last words of his spirit-friend sounding in his ears. He felt the black handle of the knife within his grasp. But the white horse and phantom rider were visible no more. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf088&image=088-008.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] Nick crossed himself once more, while the cold drops stood upon his forehead. Then, placing the knife within his breast, he spurred Norah Creen, and gallopped forward. The heavy clouds were now scudding away before a strong breeze, and the rising moon began to appear dimly working her way upward from the horizon. Wide streaks of light and shadow began to be developed over the face of the country, and it appeared probable that by the time Mick Teenan should have reached the Ford, the clear light of a cloudless sky would enable him to discern whatever good or evil might be in his path. The young man, though his head was bent upon his horse's neck, his brow rigid, and his teeth set, as if in intense thought, was yet almost unconscious of what he was about. His mind was a confused chaos of strange phantasma, in which no object was clearly distinct, yet a thousand were vividly present. The events of the evening, his tavern companions, his mysterious interview with the dead, his lonely ride, all were mingled together, and wrapped in a maze of unreality. Only one idea gleamed palpably forth, and that was of the act---the blow---by which his life was to be saved. He nervously clutched the black handle of the spirit's knife, and bending on the mane of Norah Creen rode on towards the Ford. He reached it. The stream was swollen and turbid, and as Norah Creen dashed in and breasted the water, her feet touched not the sand. The storm had fed the mountain streams, and the Ford was no longer passable save by swimming. The black mare snorted and blew the muddy water from her nostrils; but she stemmed the current gallantly, and reached the opposite bank. There sat a pale-faced, weeping woman, with a thin shawl wrapped about her fragile form, dripping with thick drops of rain. Norah Creen stood still upon the banks and neighed. Her eyes were inflamed and dilated with fright. Mick Teenan clutched the black handle of his knife. The moon now burst brilliantly from behind a frowning cloud. Her rays feel brightly upon the rushing water and over the wet sward of the banks. They fell, too, upon the white, melancholy countenance of the lonely woman, sitting upon a stone by the bank of the stream. The woman's eyes were blue, and tears were gushing from them thickly and fast. Mick Teenan's heart sank within him. `I am weary---I am sick,' spoke the woman, in a low, sweet voice, like music. `May I ride with you, friend, to the nearest village? ' Mick Teenan, as he listened to that voice of singular melody, half rose in his stirrups, and stretched forth his hand to lift the woman to the saddle. But Norah Creen, at this moment neighed, and struck the earth with her hoof, and at the same moment the black handle of the spirit's knife glowed beneath the young man's grasp like fire. Mick Teenan called on the name of God, and raised the glittering steel. It descended into the bosom of the weeping woman. `Draw---and strike again!' But Michael Teenan released his clutch of the knife, and plunged his rowels in the side of Norah Creen. The gallant mare stretched forth her neck. She snuffed the breeze and sprang away like a cross-bolt. Then sounded a shriek amid that lonely place, as if a thousand souls were expiring in agony. Its horrible, unearthly sound was echoed and re-echoed from the hills. The terrible chorus, mingled and prolonged, froze the blood and maddened the brain of the young man. Then, from afar---from afar off among the snows of the north, came an answering shriek. It was the cry of an evil spirit coming to the rescue of his fallen sister. Norah Creen, with breast distended, with blood-shot eyes and streaming mane, fleeked with streaks of foram, dashed forward. And her master, bending down, hugged the neck of his brave mare. On they swept, clattering through the solitudes; and behind, on the [
