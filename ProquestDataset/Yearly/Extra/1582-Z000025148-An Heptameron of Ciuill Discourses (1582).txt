 Queenes Maiesties Garde: Viz-chamberlaine to her Highnesse,  & of her Maiesties moste Honourable Priuie Connsell: GEORGE WHETSTONE, wissheth long continuance of Honor, Health and Happynesse. painting of INGRATITVDE and ENVIE, like Feends: rather performed a worke of Iudgement, then Arte: for so soyled with infamie are these passions as hell ought to be their harbour,  & not the heart of man. All other defeactes of the minde haue their cause of nature, or colour fro reason. PRIDE proceedeth from mans ouerweening, of his owne excellencie: the Sourse of AMBITION, is the glory and reuerence giuen vnto Aucthoritie. ANGER, and reuenge, groweth from the iniurie of others. But these two yokefellowes INGRATITVDE and ENVIE, doe degenerate from kinde, and maske without visard of excuse. The other pursue their enemies and seeke to breake but the barres of their aduauncemet: but the one of these woundeth his friend, whom he ought to honour, and the other reprocheth vertue, who the wicked reuerence: And least, Time, the true exposer of Secrets, reproche me, as a Fosterer of both these dampnable vices. Of Ingratitude, in not acknowledging, many receiued fauours, of a Right noble Italian Gentleman. Of Enuie, in smouldring his most cleare vertues: who with a zealous affection, oftentimes in my hearing, made his tongue, an honorable Trumpet to sounde the bright renowne of her Maiesties excellencie (as he sayd, and I beleeue vppon earth) the fountaine of grace and goodnes: who vsed her sacred name, with such a reuerent regard, as in his behauiour, I noted the full consideration of a dutifull subiect, denized by the eternall fame, of her Highnes deuine Grace. So that desirous to erect some Memorial Monumet of his worthines, I haue take vpo me to be the Secretarie of a few, of many his precious vertues: Which I humbly present vnto your honor, with a hand redy to doe you effectuall seruice: and a tongue confessing, that you shall herein beholde, the least part of those glorious giftes, which eternize your name, and binde the generall multitude, to honour your Counterfet, for whose benefite, I haue likewise committed to memorie, the ciuill disputations, and speaches of sundry well Courted Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen, his Guestes, during the time of my intertainment, with Segnior Phyloxenus (for so couertly I name him, least in giuing him his true honorable Tytles in England, I should make a passage for Enuie, to iniurie him in Italy) whose exercises, if my penne hath not maimed them in the reporting, may be a president of behauiours to the indifferent well qualited Gentleman and Gentlewoman: Besides, a true Anatomie of the inconueniences, which eclypse, & of the vertues which expresse the glory of Marriage: an estate both honorable and diuine: honorable, in that, she is imbraced of all men: diuine, because in the last yeare of their life she (in dispite of death) maketh men to liue a new terme, in their children and posteritie: not vnlike to a leafe fallen Rose, which in his stalke hath many tender buddes: Which bare report of mine: I reuerently protect vnder the Garde, of your honors regarded vertues: A bare report, I Christen it: for, whatsoeuer is praise worthy in this Booke, belongeth to Segnior Phyloxenus and his Courtly fauourers: and what is worthlesse, is the blame of my imperfect iudgement: So that, besides the protection, I am humbly to craue, that your Honor will receiue whatsome-euer is due to them, with a fauorable countenance, and to pardon the vnsufficiencie of their Trowchman: with an imagination, that his Present, is the testimonie of a duetiful affection: Who zealously prayeth, that your vertues maye haue as full power ouer Enuie, as they haue Aucthoritie to command the willing mindes of the best inclined dispositions: Of which number, it may please you of fauour, though not of merit, to account me. Â¶ Your Honors most bounden, GEORGE WHETSTONS. vnpolyshed labour: For, he that is the Troucheman of a Straungers Tongue, may well declare his meaning, but yet shall marre the Grace of his Tale: And, therefore, Themistocles , the noble Captayne and Philosopher of Athens , compareth suche forced Speaches, to Tapistrie Hangings rowled vp: which, beyng open, appeare beautifull: and fowlded, reserue their Uertue, but lose their showe: But I expect (somwhat) a better euent, then may an Interpreter, that is bownd to a present Reporte: for my Respit, hath ben sufficient to cosider of Segnior Phyloxenus , and his honorable companies vertues: and (least by rash acquitall of their fauours, I should do iniurie, to their reputation) I haue, with well aduised Iudgement, bethought mee, of suche memorable Questions and Deuices, as I heard and sawe presented, in this most noble Italian Gentlemans Pallace, the Christmas twelue moneths past: and aunswerable to my weake capassitie, haue exposed ye same, in such sort, as if thou art not too curious, may delight, and content thee: and if not too carelesse, may directe, and benefit thee: And to satisfie thee, wherin: I giue thee friendly knowledge, that Segnior Philoxenus reueret regard of the Queenes Maiesties high Uertues, is a President for thee: with a dutiful, and vnfained heart, to loue, feare, and obay her Highnesse, from whome, next vnder God, thou receiuest such sweete blessinges: as through the whole world, her excellencie is renowned, and thy prosperitie enuied. By this noble Gentlemans ciuill intertainment of strangers, thou mayste perceyue with what Garland, Courtisie, is principally crowned: By the ciuill behauiours, of Soranso, Dondolo, Bergetto , and other Gentlemen herein named, thou haste a President of gouernment, which will commend thee: and by well regarding their speeches, thou shalt finde a discreete methode of talke, meete for a Gentleman. The lyke benefit, shall Gentlewomen receiue, in Imitating, of Madona Aurelia (Queene of ye Christmas pleasures) Maria Belochi, Lucia Bella, Franceschina Santa , and the rest of the wel qualited Gentlewomen. Besides, a number of other Morall documentes, needefull reprehensions, and witty sayinges, to perfect the commendation, both of a Gentleman, and Gentlewoma. (Courteous Reader) thou haste heare, the honorable institution of Marriage, so perfectly Anatomed, as a verye weake Iudgement, may see the causes, which make Houshould quarrelles, to resemble Hell. Againe, the ma, which is willing to liue happily, may here learne such directions, and lawes, as will chaunge his priuate house, into a Paradice on earth. If ciuill and Morall pleasures, withall these benefites, may make thee intertaine thys booke and report well of the Aucthor. I assure thee thou shalt be pleased, and I satisfied. But if thou makest thy tongue, enemie to thy owne reputation, thou mayest detract, but not reproche the worke: Iniure, but not hurt the writer, for both will liue, and laugh such Callumniators to scorne, when either are readie to doe the discrete Reader seruice. Some will (perchaunce more of enuie to heare a stranger commended, then of pittie to bemone my hard fortune, or fowle vsage) say, I haue as iust cause to complaine, of iniuries receiued at Roane, Rome , and Naples , as to commend the vertues and good intertainment, of Signior Philoxenus : But to giue such Suggestioners a double good example, both of patience and thankefulnesse: I heare protest, that as these iniuries begunne, with my hard fortune, so they ended, no wayes in my discredite: And as I forgeue the causes of my mishaps, so scorne I, to recount them, to receiue amendes, in a little pittie. But, for that they, and all such as vew my Report, may learne of me to bee gratefull for receiued benefites: I make it knowen: That this trauell, is Segnior Philoxenus due: And I still his debter, and so shall remayne during my life: reseruing a good affection, to bestow on such as receiue his Uertues: and my paynes to profite and comend them selues. And in my opinion, it is iust they doe so: Wherfore, to giue a disgrace to ceremonies, gentle Reader I ende: as I hope to finde thee mine. Thine assured friend, George Whetston. BOOKE.

The mighty IOVE beholding from aboue, The mistes of sinne, which from the earth arose, In angry moode, sent IRIS downe to mooue, Throughout the worlde, the exercise of foes, With vengeance armde: who poured downe her Ire, And with debates, set Monarchies a fyre. Whole Countries burnde, did dim the Sun with smoke The Cannon noyse, the Ayre with Thunder rent: The wounded men, with shrikes the Heauens shoke; The Temples spoyld: the Townes to ruine went: Vnwillyng yet, to worke the worlds decay, IOVE, CYLLEN sent, in part his wrath to staye. Who hastes his charge, with winges as swift as winde, But comming to, the Region next the grounde, He could no way, for clowdie darknes finde: And fearing, in the Ocean to be drownde: He houered till, in fine, he did espie, A PHAROS light, which was a PHENIX eye.

Chiefly contayning: A ciuill Contention, whyther, the maryed or single lyfe, is the more worthy: And after many good Reasons, alleadged on either parte, Sentence is giuen in the behalfe of Mariage. dismantled of her braue Attyre, lamented the absence of Dame aestas company, and that faire Phaebus in his Retrogradatio, entring the Tropique of Capricorne , and mounting in the Zodiacke, licensed naked Hyemps , to powre down her wrath, vpon the face of the whole worlde: through dread of whose boysterous stormes, euery lyuing creature, by the direction of Nature retired himselfe vnto his safest succour, as the Birde to his Nest, the Beast to his Couert, the Bee to his hyue, the Serpent to his hole: onely Man excepted, [  Man by reson inlargeth the boundes of Nature, within whose lymites euery other creture lyueth. ] who (being beautified with a deuine spirite, and armed with reason, farre aboue the reache of Nature) scorneth to be chayned vnto any place, through the violence or iniurie of Tyme: In this dead season, suche were my Affayres, that Necessytie sent me into a Countrey farre from home, where as I was no lesse vnacquainted wt the people, then ignorant of the wayes: And hauing trauayled the great part of a Christmas Eue in a desart Forrest,   [  This was the Forrest of Rauenna in Italye, (for the most part) of pine Apple trees. ] strayed out of knowledge, I tooke me to a deepe beaten way, which promised a likelyhood to finde out some spedie Harbour: And after I had iornyed the space of an hower, in a sweete Groaue of Pyne Apple trees, mine eye fastened vpon a stately Pallace, ye brightnes wherof, glimmered through the Braunches of the younger woodde,   [  This Pallace was .10. miles from Rauenna towardes the Riuer of Poo. ] not vnlyke the Beames of the Sonne throughe the Crannelles of a walle, assuryng then my selfe, too receyue best Instructions, of the better sort of people: such was my haste, as I soone arriued at this sumptuous place: but according to ye condition of time,   [  The custome of Christmas. ] in Christmas, sooner to fynde a friende feasting in the Hall, then walkinge in the Feelde: other then a few of ignoraunt peysauntes, I could perceiue no person. The delight I tooke to beholde the scituation, and curious workmanship of this Pallace, made mee so long forget the cause of my arriuall there, as in the ende one of the well qualyted Seruaunts (hauinge knowledge of my being without) in a seruisable order, came and presented mee with his Lordes curteous welcome, and reuerently requested mee to alight, and enter the Pallace: I which imagined this entertainment to be but an Italion curtesie, after thankes geuen, by a modest excuse, refused so great a fauour, & onely craued, to be directed the rediest way to Rauenna : the Seruaunt cunninglye replyed, that I could not bee receiued into the Cittie without his Lordes Bollytyne ,   [  BOLLYTINE, a warrant of health without which, no man may trauell in Italy. ] and at this time hee sealed no mans safecundit, without knowledge, that his affayres requyred great haste: in so muche, as one with his importunities, and ouercome with wearynesse of Trauell, I commytted my Horse, to the orderinge of my man, and accompanied this officious Seruant, towardes the Pallace, and by the way, ouer a lardge entraunce into a faire court, I might read these two breefes in Italion . Pisano e Forresterio. Entrate,   [  A liberall welcome. ] e ben venuto. Which generall inuyting, imboldned mee so far, as I hardely marched towardes the great Hall, the Skreene wherof, was curiously fronted with clowdy Marble, supported on euery side the passadges, with stately Pillers of Geate:   [ Welcom and Bountie, the Porters. ] and ouer the three Portalles, stood the Images of two men: the one of Allablaster Marble, bare headed, representing the vertue of welcome: the other of blewe Marble, attyred lyke a Cooke, and by him were artifycially painted, Pheasants, Partriges, Capons, & other costly Cates, as the Figure of Bountie : At the entry of this stately Hall, I was receiued by the Lord of the Pallace, accompanied with diuers Gentlemen of good quallytie, with so ciulll and friendly intertaynment, as his behauiour blazoned the true knowledge of Curtesie: before we past any further, I began to recount the Aduenture which brought me thither, and craued his honourable fauour for my dispatch: Why? then (quoth Segnior Phyloxenus ) for so (for some cause) I name ye Lord of ye Pallace, I thanke your hard Fortune for arriuyng you here, to do me this honour: No hard, but happy Fortune (quoth I) if I may liue to honour you with my effectual seruice: Well (quoth he) after your weerie trauaile, it is more needeful to prouide for your repose, then for a further Iorney, and so lead me the way into a faire great Chamber, richly hung with Tapistrie: ye Roof wherof, was Allablaster plaister, embost wt many curious deuises in gold, & in sundrie places in proper colours was ingraued his deuise, which was A Holly Tree, full of red Beries: & in the same, a fluttering MAVIS fast limed to the bowes , with this posie in french, Qui me nourit, me destruit : And, in verie deed, the beries of the tree feedeth this Bird, and the barke maketh Lime to fetter her. But I afterwardes learned,   [  A couert description of desyre. ] Segnior Philoxenus vsed this Ensigne as a couert description of desire: whose sweete torments nourisheth the minde, but consumeth the bodie to the graue. In this bewtifull place, I imbraced the salutations of such a braue troupe of Gentlemen, & Gentlewomen, as the honour of the householde might well giue enuie vnto some Princes Court. And least, at my first coming, I might be abashed through small acquantance,   [  A ciuill foresight meete for a Gentleman. ] Segnior Philoxenus , emboldened mee with a familiar communication, and in the ende vppon a conuenient occasion, demaunded of me the name of my Countrie: I aunswered him, I was a Gentleman of England , voluntarily exiled with a burnyng desyre, to see the Monuments of other Countries,   [  A necessary regard for Trauelers. ] the order of their gouernment, and manners of the people. And are you of that blessed Ile (quoth he?) where the people liue in peace and prosperytie, vnder the rule of a Mayden Queene,   [  The vertues of the Queenes Maiestie, maketh the Iland of Englande famous through out the whole Worlde. ] crowned with such deuine vertues, as the whole world may hardly containe her fame. Sir (quoth I) your good testimony of her worthynesse, being a Straunger, taketh all occasion from mee (her dutiful subiect) to inlardge her renowne. O (quoth he) if Enuie durst detract her openly, as she secretlye conspireth her ouerthrowe, in these partes you should be driuen to stop your eares, or endure a torment (to a faithfull subiect) more violent then Death. But the vertue of her Shielde,   [  Vertue stoppeth the mouth of Enuye, But fyreth her hart with mallyce, ] I meane her graue Senate, hath returned the Dartes of Enuy so thick vpon her Souldiers, as she hath no power to eclips her bright renowne, whose vertue shineth in Enuies dispight as a Diamod in an obscure place, or as the Sunne through smal passadges, into the bowels of the earth: so that happy and thrice happye are you, the Subiectes of the good Queene of England , whose gratious gouernement, filleth your Coffers with wealth, sealeth your dores with peace, and planteth quietnesse in your Conscience: so that (blessed aboue other Nations) you liue abroad, without suspition of daunger at home: and at home fearelesse of enemies abrode. Wherefore, in honour of your Soueraigne, whose fame armeth al true knights, with an earnest desire to doo her seruice. I am glad of the meane, to bestow on you, or any of hir nation, ye affection of a friend. Sir ([quoth] I) the vertue of these honorable thoughts blaseth ye true magnanimity of a noble mind, which measureth not your fauour by the desart of others, but wt the ryaltie of your heart,   [  The true Blazon of a noble mynd. ] & so binde thousands in recognisance of seruice: among which debters I desire to bee inrolled, although I can discharge but litle. After we had bestowed a smal time in these like speches, he comanded some of his seruantes to direct me vnto a lodging (if I pleased) to bee dispoiled of my riding attyre: who straight waies brought mee into a Bed Chamber, so well accommodated with euery necessarie pleasure, as might haue serued for the repose of Cupid and his louer Ciches : hauing a fayre prospect into a goodly Garden, beautified, with such rare deuises, as deserued to be compared with the earthly Paradice of Tiuoly .   [  Tiuoly .12. miles from Rome, where the Cardinall of Esta hath a most rare Garden. ] And to be breefe, this Pallace, with all her conueiances, as well necessarie, as of pleasure, fully mached the statelynesse of Cardinall Furnesaes Pallace, buylded & beautified, with the ruinous Monumentes of Rome , in her pride: so that the curiousnesse thereof, was of power to haue inchaunted my eyes with an immodest gase, had I not remembred,   [  Cardenal Furnesaes pallace in Rome. ] that it belongeth vnto a Gentlema to see, and not to stare vpon the straungest Nouell that is: for bace is his mynde, whose spirit hourely beholdeth not greater matters then eyther beautie,   [  A necessarie obseruation for a Gentleman. ] buylding or brauerie. And certertenly, at this instant, I delighted more to contemplate of Segnior Phyloxenus vertues: then to regarde his sumptuous buyldings, who (as I learned of one of the Seruantes) all the yeere opened his dores to euerie ciuill Gentleman, and at Christmas,   [  A worthye Custome. ] inuited all commers, as a customarie dutie: so large was the prescription of his curtesie. But, which shined aboue the rest, he was in his youth, brought vp in the French Courte, where, by the grace of God, and labour of some good freend (as his behauyours could not but winne many) he learned to serue God, with purenesse of heart,   [  He was a Protestant. ] and not with painted ceremonies, as his superstitious Countrie me do: which was one chief cause, why he spake so reuerently of the Queenes maiestie, whose vertues make her enemies dumbe, for malice will not let them say well, and shame forbids them to speake amis, of her sacred lyfe: by ye time I had talked awhile, with one of the seruantes, & put my selfe in a more ciuill order, then was necessarie for trauel, Supper was in a redinesse: whiche although it exceeded the common order of fasts, yet it passed not far the bounds of auncient custome: for my place at the Table, I had the pryueledge of a Stranger, set aboue my degree, and with the same intertainment, were Frenchmen, Almain, Duchmen and other Gentlemen,   [ Other straungers arriued by the lyke aduenture. ] Straungers, intreated. The Grand Maister of the feast, in wordes gaue vs one welcome for all, but not so few as a thousand in affable countenaunces. Supper being ended, according to the custome of the place, a Cake was cut in peeces, to the number of the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen present,   [  A custome generaly vesd in Fraunce, and in some places of Italy. ] & if the marked peece were allotted vnto a man, he should be King, if to a woman, she should be Queene of the Christmas pleasures: for it was agreede, there should be but one to commaund, and all to obay. Madona Aurelia , Sister to the Lorde of the Pallace, was crowned with the Lot, whose worthynesse was such, as herein it seemed Fortune obayed desert: for there was no Gentlewoman in the trowpe, that Aurelia excelled not in beautie, & singularity of wit, nor no Gentlema, that her vertues inchaunted not, with more admiraion, then the Sirens sweete songes, the wether weried Sayler, so that of the one shee was crowned with Enuy , and of the other with Honor . But in as much, as this was but the fyrst night of her raigne, she referred the Proclamation of her lawes vntill the next daye, and so dismist the attendaunce of her subiectes for that night, which (in sooth) lasted me but a sleepe, so soundly after trauell, I imbraced mine ease. The next Day no sooner appeared, but the Trumpets sounded the honour of Christmas vppon which Sommons, the Companie rose, and (attired in their most sumptuous weedes) in the greate Chamber attended their Queene Aurelia , who about Seruice time, (with the Maiestie of a Goddesse) presented her selfe: on whome, all the Trowpe waighted vnto the Chappell, wheare the Seruice was not so ceremonious, as in other Churches of Italy , and yet more then agreed with Segnior Phyloxenus conscience, onely to geue no offence, to the superstitious zeale of others. The Seruice ended, against the returne of the company, the Tables were couered in a most stately Order, and with the sownd of Trumpettes, were furnished with so many seuerall daintie Disshes, as the Rialtie of the Feaste, might haue pleased Heliogabalus :   [  Heliogabalus a most voluptuous Emperor of Rome. ] After Queene Aurelia was set, the rest tooke their accustomed places: but (God knowes) the eyes of the greater parte, were more hungrye, then their stomackes: for their appetites were dulled, with the ouerplentie of meates, and their desires quickened, with the regarde of the faire Gentlewomen. The Dinner & euery solempne seruice ended, Seg. Phyloxenus comitted the company, to the good intertainment of his Sister Aurelia , and (with a speciall sute) recomended me vnto her fauour: After vewe was taken of the Attendantes, certaine Gentlemen and Gentlewomen (by the appoinctment of queene Aurelia ) were addopted with the names of their Fortunes, as occasion will manifest hereafter: and for that I was a Traueler, she calde mee Caualiero Ismarito , in Englishe, The wandring Knight : whereuppon, Madam (quoth I) you haue christened mee with the true name of my fortune: for I was but late out of my way, and now am straied out of myself: where are you then quoth Aurelia ? at your only direction (quoth I:) well (quoth she) since so cunningly you prefer your selfe, I admitte you my seruant, and as you deserue so will I reward: & Madam quoth I, if I bee not loyall, let mee not lyue: well (quoth she) I except the best. The rest of the affaires set in good order, the Harold proclaimed the lawes, whereunto the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen were bounde, with the penallties for the breach of them. execute all the charges, and offices assigned by their Queene Aurelia , and that they should be attendant of her pleasure. Item euery Gentleman was bound, to serue some one Misterisse, befor the next day at noone, vppon paine, to bee turned into the great Hall, among the Countrie Trulles ye whole Christmas. And euery Gentlewoman yt had not a Seruant, was iudged vnworthye, to bee courted for one weeke: for his merrit was holden very small, that coulde bee intertained of none, and her conditions very crooked that was beloued of none. Item euery Gentleman, was bound to geue his owne Mistresse the honour of his seruise, and the chiefe place in his commendations, vppon paine, to lose her seruice, and to bee entertained of no other. For he that was disloyall to one, coulde not be holden faithfull vnto an other. Item euery Gentlewoman, was bounde to imploye her owne Seruaunt vppon paine to be reputed symple. For she that affyed not in her owne Seruant, had no reason to trust an others. Item euery Gentleman was bound, to defende the honor of his Misterisse, both with worde and sworde, vppon paine to be reputed a Coward, and not to were her gloue. For he was holden very vnsufficient, that prysed not his Misterisse honor aboue his owne lyfe. Item eurey Gentlewoman was bound, to incouradge her Seruant with Good countenances, and vppon the execution of any worthy seruice to rewarde him, with the kissing of her hand, vpon paine to be deemed, vnworthy to be serued. For she of all the world is acounted to rigorous a Dame, that with scorne, receyueth dutifull seruice. Item euery Gentleman was bounde to Court his misterisse with Ciuill speaches, vpon paine to be forbidde, to talke of loue for three daies. For he was accompted bace mannered, or verie grose witted, that coulde not pleasantlye intertaine time with a ciuill discourse. Item euery Gentleman was bound, either by some exercise of value, or by some shew of excellency of wit, to approue him selfe worthy of his Mistrisse: vpon paine, to be spoyled of his Armes, and the whole Christmas to attende with the Pages for he was holden vnworthy the societie of men, or the affection of women, that was neither valiant nor wise. These Lawes proclaimed, Queene Aurelia appoynted an elderly Courtier named Fabritio , and a well spoken Gentlewoman, called Donna Isabella , to be Iudges of the controuersyes, in disputation: and to attend her in her affaires of pleasure, she chused Segnior Soranso , a Gentleman Italion , of Wit quick and sharp, and for his deuices, sweete and pleasant: Don Dondolo , a Napolitan, haughtie and proude in his conceits. Monsier Bargetto a Frenchman , amourous and light headed. Doctor Mossenigo, a Germaine , so called, for the plaine discouerie of his mind. Segnior Faliero a Scot , subtill and cunnyng in his deuyces: and my selfe Caualiero Ismarito , an English man , in whiche name heereafter, I will present those actions that touch my selfe.   [  Courtisie vnto straungers, is a marke of Gentilytie. ] This wise, choice she made to priueldge the Strangers with the hyest fauour. Of Gentlewomen, she chused Maria Belochy , a Damsell whose eye was able to fire a mountaine of Ice. Lucia Bella , for fairenesse & sweete behauiour an Angel. Hellena Dulce , a louing and affable Gentlewoman. Franceschina sancta , so called for hir modest and lowlye countenance: Katherina Trista , a sowre and testy Dame: Aluisa Vechio , who although shee were in the wayne of her yeeres, yet was she in the pride of yong desires. This done, Queene Aurelia , by consent, deuided the exercises of euery day, into these times:   [  A diuision of their pleasurs ] the forenoone to bee bestowed in the seruice of God: after dinner, two houres to be intertained in ciuell discourse, and disputation: the rest till Supper at pleasure: and after supper to spende a time in daunsing, maskinge, or in other like pastimes as occasion presented. The greater part of Christmas day, was spent in establishing these orders, the rest was ouercome wt solempne Musick, for, among the better sorte, that day is honoured, with no light mirth. The next daye by nine a Clocke, according to one of the charges in the Proclamation, you might see the yong Gentlemen & Gentlewomen, coupled together lyke fowles on Saint Valentines day morninge. But Cauiliero Ismarito , hauing the eyes of his hart setteled vpon his Mistresse beautie, with carelesse regarde, behelde the rest of the company: and leanyng by a dore, thorow which she should passe, he awayghted Queene Aurelias comming. Who at her accustomed howre, presented her self with an aduauntage of brauerie, whom the whole trowpe reuerently saluted, and honorably accompanyed vnto the Chappell. After Seruice, Dinner, and all were solempnlye ended: Queene Aurelia with a chosen company, retyred her selfe, into a pleasant drawing Chamber,   [ Musick refresheth the wits ] to execute the reported ordenaunce. But to quicken the Spirites of the company, before they entred into discourse, she commaunded a faire Eunucke Boy, to singe some one songe, as hee thought good, who obaying her commaundement, with a heauenly note, vnto the Lute sunge this louyng Laye. When we imbrace, the wish of our desyre. All pleasures els, that kinde or Arte may moue, To loue, are lyke, the heate of paynted fyre Loue is the roote, whereon swete thoughts do grow, Loue is the sowrce, from whence content doth flow. Â¶When I behould my Mistresse in the face, Loue from her eyes, a thousand Graces throwes. But when in armes, I doe her selfe imbrace. One smyling looke exileth all my woes. Then straight our lippes prepare them selues to fight And on eche kys, Loue seales a new delight. Â¶What would you more? I wish me in my graue, Were but my soule with halfe these pleasures crownde: And heare on earth to be my Misterisse slaue, I hold me free, and others to be bounde. Wherfore, I sing which I in sollace proue, There is no heauen, to lyfe bestowed in loue. The sweet deliuerie of this sonet, so inchanted ye harts of ye hearers, as for a space, their sences gaue place to the contemplatio of their soules. In the end, Madona Isabella by this motio, made ye whole copany a passadge for speech. If Loue be so sweete a passion (quoth she) I muse from what cause proceedeth the complaintes of Louers, who wt showering teares, bedeweth the earth: with misty sights, dimmeth the aire, & wt shril outcries pearceth the heauens The cause quoth Soranso , proceeds of our fleshly imperfections, which corruptes ye nature of good things, & not of any defect in loue: for loue is a simple deuine vertue, and hath his being in ye soule, whose motions are heauenly.   [  Loue simplye is good. ] I haue read ([quoth] Isabella ) that there be sundry kindes of loue. The vse of loue, are diuers [quoth] Soranso , as in zeale towardes God, in duty towardes our Countrie,   [  The distinctions of loue. ] in obedience towards our parets, & in affectio towards our frends All which motions proceedeth forth of one loue, although som are more vehement then ye other, euen as many Rivers doo run out of one Spring, whereof som haue a more swift course then the other. But of that passion which we ordinarily call loue, the wish either tends to Marriage or wantonesse. There is matter of disputation in Marriage ([quoth] Franceschina ,) because ye estate is honorable,   [ Knowne euils are not to bee defended. ] & yet subiect to crosse fortunes: But touching your conclusio of watones, it deserueth to die in silence, for known euils are to bee chastened, without allowing their defences. Madame ([quoth] Faliero ) vnlesse you reuoke this sentence, we wil haue you indited at Rome as an heretick, for by the Popes Canons, Priests may not marry : & they haue a custom among them selues, not to liue chast. Well ([quoth] Franceschina , if the Pope for this opinion, burne mee as an heretick, good men will cannonise mee for a vertuous Uirgin. Thease Digressions (quoth Queene Aurelia ,)   [  A necessarye note. ] are the meanes (rather) to worke a confusion of our memories, then to conclude any beneficial matter for our instruction And therfore, I hold it to greater purpose (substantially) to handle one Argument, then (sleightly) to ouerrunne many causes, where ye doubts we leaue vnresolued, wyl be more daungerous vnto the hearer, then the Counselles we vse, profitable vnto the follower. Madame, (quoth Fabritio ) I hold it good, we obay your direction. And for that Mariage , is the most honourable euent of Loue :   [  A contention whether Mariage or the single lyfe, is the worthyer. ] and that a Single lyfe , is the greatest testimonie of Chastytie : A ciuill Contention , to prooue which is the most worthy of the two, would conclude much contentment: For, as Yron and Flynt, beat together, haue the vertue to smite fire: so, mens wittes, encountryng in doutful questios,   [  Argument decideth doubtes. ] openeth a passage for imprisoned Trueth . Queene Aurelia, and the rest of the company, lyked verie well of the Subieat : and studing, who weare the fittest to deale in this Controuersie, Aurelia (with a glaunsinge eye) beheld, that her seruant Ismarito, witsafed no greater Token,   [  Wise scilence worketh mor regarde then foolish talke. ] that he tooke delight in thease actions, then (sometime) the secrete bestowyng of a modest smile: whervpon she forethought, that as Floods, when they are most hyest, maketh least noise: euen so (perchaunce) his styll tongue, was gouerned by a flowyng witt, and desirous to sounde his sufficiencie, she quickned him with this crosse surmise. Seruant (quoth she) your sober lookes, promiseth a hope that you will vndertake Dianaes quarrell: but (which wil serue in this question) I feare me, you comaund Loue , so much, as you contempne Mariage : And the greater is my suspicion,   [  A fault in many trauellers. ] in that you are a Trauayler: ye nature of which sort of people, is to swell, with a monsterous disdayne of Mariage? The reason is (say they) their Affections are poysoned, with the knowledge of womens so haynous euyls, as thei dare not venter of that vocation: But my opinion is, they haue learned so many subtilties to deceiue shiftlesse woma, as dandled with the imbracements of sundry Loues , they forsweare Mariage , who bindes them to one only wyfe. And if you be infected wt the humour of thease sorte of Trauailers, you may wel vndertake this charge:   [  All unmarried pass vnder the name of chast. ] for Venus, though she loue not Diana , yet is she the sworn enemie of Iuno . And if you be sound from this infirmitie, the little haste you make to marry, witnesseth, you honor Hymen , with no great deuotion, and therfore, I comaund you too vse all your possyble proofes, in the Defence of a Single lyfe : and for your Assistaunce, I do appoint you, Lucia Bella , whom, this Charge can not mislyke, because (as I vnderstand) she meanes to be a professed Nun: You are to encounter the opinions of many, and therfore arme your selues, with as good reasons, as you may. Madame (quoth Ismarito ) I am so deepely bound vnto your commaundement, as I am driuen to leaue youre suggestions not answeared, and my owne innocency, vnexcused, & only attend ye incounter of him, yt wil maintaine Marriage , to be more worthy then a syngle life : which vocation of Marriage , though I reuerently honour, yet I so zealously affect the other, as I hope (where the Iudges are indifferent) to make the glory thereof to shine as the faire white, aboue euery other colour. Syr, quoth Soranso , though white be a fayre colour,   [  Defences of Marriage ] yet are the choyse of all other colours, more rich and glorious: so, though Virginitie (which is the fayrest flower of a single lyfe ) be precious, in the sight of God, and in the opinion of men, yet is Marriage more precious, in that, it is a sacred institution of God, and more honoured of men: the Marryed are reuerently intertained, when the vnmaryed are but familiarly saluted. The Maried in assemblies, are honoured with the hyghest places, the vnmarryed humble them selues vnto the lowest. To be short, Virginitie is the handmayde of Marriage . Then, by how much the Master is greater then the seruaunt, by so much Marriage is more worthy then is single lyfe . I confesse, quoth Ismarito ,   [  Defences of a single lyfe. ] Marriage is an honourable estate, instituted of God, and embraced of men but wheron had she her beginning? vpon this cause, to keepe men from a greater inconuenience: as the Lawe was founded vppon this reason, to punishe the trespasses of men. But if no offence had ben giuen, the Law had not needed So if man had lyued within boundes of reason (whiche before any commaundement geuen; was vnto him a Law) Marriage might haue ben spared: and therefore in the hyest degree, is but a vertue vppon necessitie: where Chastitie , is a deuine vertue, gouerned by the motions of the soule, which is immortall, and perticypating of the same vertue, is alwaies fresh and greene. The euerspringing Baye , is the Metamorphos of chast Daphne whom Appollo , although he weare a soueraign GOD, could not allure to Mariadge : which prooueth Chastitie , a true spark of Diuinitie , whose twinkling reflexions, so daseleth the eyes of imagined Gods (whose powers must needes be more great then the greatest of men) as they cannot see an ende of their incontinent desires: where as the beautie of Marriadge , is many times blasted by fortune, or the frailtie of the Married. Therfore (think I) by how much deuyne thinges are of greater emprise then earthlye, by so much the Single lyfe , is more worthy then then the maryed. And in aduauntage, [[quoth] Lucia Bella ] where Soranso sayth, that there is great honour done vnto the married, and to the Single is giuen light regard, I pray you whether are Baccus minions or the Muses , most reuerensed? Among men, whose places are hyer then the Cleargies? and amonge women, whose greater then the religious Dames? They haue not this preheminence [[quoth] Faliero ] because   [  Defences of Mariadge. ] they professe a Single life , but because their function is more sacred then other mens, who if their prayers to GOD bee no more zealous,   [ The cause why the Cleagie are reuerensed. ] then their vowes to chastytie are stedfast, you flye to the authoritie of a company as spotted as Labans Sheepe. But where Sir Ismarito saith, yt Mariage is but a vertue vpon necessytie, to restrayne man from a greater euyll: I approoue it an estate, set downe by Nature, and that man hath but amplified it, with certain Ceremonies, to make perfect the determination of nature: For we dayly see, in vnreasonable Creatures, Mariage is (in a sorte) worshypped: Fowles of the Ayre (I meane) she he and the she, cupple together, flie together, feede together, and neast together. The Turtle is neuer merie after the death of her Mate: and in many brute Beastes, the lyke Constancie is fownd: But (generally) there is neuer iarre nor mislykyng betwene the Male and Female, of vnpollitique creatures: and among the most barbarous people that euer lyued, by the Impression of Nature,   [  Vnpollitick creatures reuerence mariadge, ] Mariage hath (euermore) ben reuerenced and honoured: Muche more, ciuill people, ought to affecte this holy estate: And where Ismarito , attributes suche Glorie vnto a Single lyfe , because that Daphne was metamorphosed into a Bay Tree, whose Branches are alwayes greene: In my opnion, his reason is fayre lyke the Bay Tree: for the Bay Tree is barren of pleasant fruict, & his plesing words of weighty matter. Furthermore, what remembrance is theare of faire Sirinx coynesse, refusing to be God Pans wife? other then that she was metamorphosed into a fewe vnprofitable Reedes: Or of Anaxaretes chaste crueltie towardes Iphis , ouer then that she remaineth an Image of Stone in Samarin . Many other suche lyke naked Monumentes remayne, of nice contempners of Marriage . But in the behalf of Mariage , thousads haue ben changed into Olyue, Pomegranate, Mulberie , and other fruitfull trees, sweete flowers, Starres, and precious Stones, by whom, the worlde is beautified, directed and noorished. In many well gouerned common wealths, Sterylitie hath ben reputed so vile, as the Aged was of no man honoured, yt had not childre of his own, to do him reuerence. Then, by how much those thinges, which noorish with increase, are more necessarie then those things, which but simply please the eye: by so muche, the marryed, is more worthy then the single lyfe. Sir,   [  Defences of a single lyfe, ] quoth Ismarito , it seemeth that you haue read a Leafe more then Sainct Katherynes Nun: for she (simply) tried all thinges, and you (subtilly) vse, but what serueth your owne tourne: you reproach a Single lyfe , with Barrennesse , & commend the fertilytie of Mariage : But had you showen the weedes with ye Corne, bare pasture wold haue retourned as great a benefit, as your haruest. The Monsters, Serpents, and loathsome Creatures, mentioned by Ouide , in his Metamorphosis, were they not I praye you the fruicts of Marriage? as wel as the blessings, whiche you so affectedlye reported? Oedippus was glad to scratch out his eyes, because he could not indure to behold the vices of his Children. The good Emperour Marcus Aurelius in his aged daies, neuer rose that he sighthed not: neuer dyned that he fretted not: nor neuer went to bedd, that he weeped not: to heare, see, and consider, the mounstrous euylls of his Children. Admit the Married , haue vertuous Children, they may dye when they are yonge, then the goodnesse of their lyues, increaseth sorrowes, by their deathes: and where the comfort is so doubtfull, it is not amisse to refuse the hazard of the greefe:   [ Vertuous fame, is an other lyfe. ] neither dyeth there any of Dianas band, but that their vertues reuiueth them as the ashes of the Phenix , tourneth into an other Phenix . It is for some Phenix sake, quoth Queene Aurelia , that you thus stoutly defend a Single lyfe . I doo but your commaundement, quoth Ismarito . Yea (quoth shee) it is at my commaundement, but yet for some others merit. Alvisa vechio , fearing that Marriage wold receiue som disgrace,   [  The impatiencie of women, will not be hidde. ] if that Queene Aurelia fauoured the Defence of a Single lyfe , could not longer suppresse her affections, but with a womans Impatiencie, blamed the rigour of Diana , who condepned Acteon to be deuoured of his own Howndes: who caused sweete Addonis to be slayne by a wylde Boare: with many other cruell partes, vnseemyng the naturall pittie of a woman: but (which might haue saued a great deale of Argument, or at the least, which wyll now soone ende the Controuersie:) compare [[quoth] she] Iuno and Diana together, and by their callings, you may easely iudge who is the worthyer. Diana (poore soule) is but a Goddesse here on earth, and Iuno is Queene of Heauen: Dianaes force, is in her Bow and Arrowes, Iuno bestoweth Thunderbolts, vpon her enemies: Diana , is attyred with greene leaues, and Iuno with glorious Starres: Diana , feedeth on rawe Fruictes, and drinketh cold water: Iunoes Feastes, are of Manna , and her Bowles are fild with Nectar: Dianes Musick, is no better then the voyces of a fewe Nymphes: Iuno is recreated with the Harmonie of Angelles: Dianaes pastime, is (a foote) to chace the fearefull Roe , where Iuno (in Phaetons wynged Chariot) pursueth a thousand seueral pleasures: then, by how much the pompe of Iuno , exceedeth the naked Triumphes of Diana : by so much, Mariage must needes be more worthye then the Single lyfe . Lucia Bella , that shuld haue answered Alvisa Vechio , (not vnlyke the Marygoulde , that cloaseth her Beautie, when Phebus is attyred with his brightest Rayes) so admyred the glory of Iuno , yt, as an inchaunted creature, office: the reason was, her hart was sodenly surprised with an ambitious desire of honor. Which change, Ismarito perceyued, with the first: and least, her scilence shuld conclude a yealding:   [  Contentmet neither followeth the greatest, nor scorneth the meanest. ] Al is not gold [[quoth] he] that glistereth , nor euery thyng counterfet that is not curiously garnished: a smyling countenance is no full testimonie of a merie hart, nor costly Garments, of a rich Purse: And (perchance) the griefe of Iunoes secret discontentmentes, is greatter then the delight of her gloryous pompe: where Diana , who (as a Diamond in the darcke, shineth of her selfe) needeth not the Ornaments of Iuno . And as shee is (symplye) of a pure substaunce, so her thoughtes, must needes be sweete, and quiet. Sir [[quoth] Maria Belochy ] our soundest iudgements, are of those things that we our selues see: therfore, if the apparaunce of Mariage , be worthier then the apparaunce of the single lyfe : if sentence be truely pronounced, it must be in the behalfe of Iuno . Queene Aurelia perceyuing the increase of Ismaritos aduersaries, (for who can stop a streame? measure the fire? weygh the winde? or hynder Fancyes passage?) and withall considering how that the controuercy was sufficiently debated, commaunded the contenders, to keepe scilence: and referred ye questio, to be Iudged by Fabritio , & Isabella . Who hauing aduisedly considered, the reasons on both sydes, agreed that a single chast lyfe pleased God, because, Chastitie is pure: and also delighteth man, because shee quieteth the mynde: but a chast marryed lyfe , bothe pleaseth, and honoureth God: because Marriage , howrely, presenteth the world, with the Image of himselfe: pleaseth, and profiteth man, because, she giueth him a companyon, by affection, chaunged into his owne disposition: of whom he hath children, who in dispight of death, preserueth him alyue. And therefore, the sentence of them both, was pronounsed by Fabritio ,   [  Sentence gyuen, in the behalfe of Mariage. ] in the behalfe of Marriage : who with all, enlarged her prayses, with the reporte of many sweet Blessinges, whiche shee liberallye bestoweth, vppon her Subiectes. But least the company, should haue ben fyred with too hasty a desyre of Marriage , he cooled theyr affections, with such caueats, as they that had their voyces ready tuned, to synge the prayses of God Himen , were of the suddayne, as mute as a fishe: by reason whereof, Fabritio , had free passage: for his counsellinge reporte: who, after many wordes, to either purpose deliuered, concluded with the opinion of Plato, That Marriage, was a Parradice on earth,   [  Platoes opinion of Mariage. ] if her Lawes be obserued: and a Hell in the House, where her Satutes are broken . The Gentlewomen wist not what to say, to Fabritios bittersweete commendation of Marriage ,   [  Pleasant talk is good physicke for sorrowe. ] vntyll Bargetto quickned their tongues, by this pleasaunt suggestion. If (quoth he) Platoes opinion be lawe, by the same reason, women are either Angells, or Deuills. And why not men, as well as women (quoth Isabella ) whose disposition beareth the greatest swaye in this vocation. I will showe you a reason, quoth Doctor Mossenigo , men with a meane, canne temper their passions:   [  The extreme passions of a woman. ] when a woman hath no measure in her loue, nor mercye in her hate: no rule in her pittie, nor pietie in her reuenge: no Iudgement to speake nor patience to dissemble: and therfore she is lykened vnto the Sea,   [  A GVNDELO, is a litle Boat like a wherie. ] whych (one whyle) is so mylde, as a small Gundelo indureth her might, and anon, with outrage, she ouerwhelmeth the taullest shippe. Ah Master Doctor, quoth Katharina Trista , I feare me you are so learned, as like the Hyen ,   [  HYEN, somtimes a man, and somtimes a woman. ] you change your self sometimes into the shape of a woman: but yet, of this malitious purpose, to learn their dispositions: only to reproch their kinde: but had any of vs the cunning, to become a man but a while, I imagine, we should euer after, loue the better to be a woman. You haue rather cause (quoth Dondolo ) to let Mayster Doctor kisse your hand, (for commeding your kynde) then to blame him, by a surmise, of iniurye, offered vnto women, for if there be a few good, they couer ye faults of a nuber that are euill: as a litle golde, guildeth a great quantitie of iron: and for any thing he sayde, you haue as generall an interest in vertue, as in vice. Yea, but [[quoth] Queene Aurelia ] he is to be blamed for his intent, which was euyll,   [  The intent of euyll, is to be punished. ] & deserueth not to be praysed for the good which came of it, which was our meryt. Madame ([quoth] the Doctor) so much greater is the good, you receiue by my Trespasse, as therby you are honoured with the vertue, to forgiue. Yea, but (quoth she) remission is to be vsed in ignorant offences,   [ Pardon is to be vsed in ignoraunce and not in wilfull faultes. ] and not in wilfull. My Habit (quoth he) is a testionie that I spake not of mallice. So much [[quoth] she] ye greater is your fault, in that it proceeded vpon pleasure: and where you thinke to priuiledge your selfe by:   [  The punishment of great offenders dooth most good in example. ] your Habyt: for Example sake, you shall at (open) Supper, bothe renounce your Heresie and make satisfaction, or abide the Iudgemet of these Gentlewome. If there be no remedie [[quoth] he] I must obay. The Doctor thus taken tardie, gaue occasion of laughter vnto the whole company. Which, blowne ouer, [[quoth] Soranso ] we haue trauailed this day to an vnfortunate ende: for that now, towardes night, we are entred into an open Champion, wheare we finde many broade wayes to Hell, & but one crosse Path to Heauen. Well ([quoth] Queene Aurelia ) we wyll take other tymes, to beate out the true passage: And (least we be lated) wee wyll no further too daye. Whervpon, after a Courtly reuerence don: Queene Aurelia , with her Attendantes, shewed her selfe in ye great Chamber, where she might repose her minde wt the choice of sundrie pleasures: For his, or her disposition was very strange, that in that company, could not finde both a Companion and sport, that pleased his humour. FINIS. the Church, to be deuoute: in place of Iustice, to be graue: at home to be affable,  & at meales to be mery:   [  Deuotion. ] for in the Churche we talke with God, who seeth our hartes and hateth Hypocrysie: in Iustice, we sitt to chasten light demeanours,   [  Grauitie. ] then, great were the shame, that our countenaunces shuld condempne our selues: At home we rule and commaunde, then were it Tyranny,   [  Affabilitie. ] to vse seuerytie, there, where, is no resistaunce. At meales to bee merrie, disgesteth meate, and refresheth the witte: then is he an enemy vnto himselfe, that contemneth the rule of health, & the helper of knowledge.   [  Myrthe. ] Howsoeuer the three first preceptes were obserued, Segnior Philoxenus and his honourable guestes duly executed the last, who in the midst of supper hearinge of Doctor mossenigos pennaunce, hasted the execution. The Doctor seeing there was no remedie, openly confessed that hee had praysed women against his wyll, for which he was condemned to singe Ab re nuntio , and to make satisfaction by some other meanes: And as hee thought the contrarie was the amends of euerie trespas, and therfore, where as he had praysed them against his will, hee was ready to dispraise them with his will. Queene Aurelia ,   [  Subtiltie beateth true meaning with his owne sword. ] woulde haue taken exceptions to these wordes, but that the company cryed, The Doctor speaks Law , which shee coulde not with Iustice violate, whervpon Mossenigo , reported as followeth. will. Sadler, named Borrihauder , who was married to an olde crabbed shrew, called Ophella : the agreement of this couple was so notable, as the Emperour Charles the fift, commaunded his Paynter Parmenio , to draw their counterfeats, as a Monument of fury: Parmenio , commyng to doe the Emperours commaundement, found Borrihauder weeping with the agony of his wiues stripes, and Ophellas cheeks as red as fire with the heate of her tonge: whiche straunge sight, chaunged his determination, into a pleasaunt conceit, and in place of their Counterfets, in a fayre table, he drew an Element troubled with lightnyng, and vnderwrit Ophella , and in another Table fastened to the same, he likewise drew an Element darkned with rayne, and vnder wright; Borihauder. Parmenio presented this trauel vnto the Emperour. The Emperour seeing the two names, and not the shape of those, hee commaunded to be drawne, demaunded the Paynters meanyng heerein, who pleasantly aunswered, that he could not take the view of Ophellas face, for feare of being fyered with the lightning of her tonge, and that Borihauder was drowned with teares, which as showers of Raine folowed the thunder claps, of his wiues Fistes: But in good time (had she died) this Demideuill Orphella fel so extremely sick, as in euery mans iudgement, it was needefull to giue Phisick to her soule, but bootelesse to bestow any of her body: Borihauder seeing her, as he thought at a good passe, was so accustomed to sorrow, as hee determined to toule her passing bel, with this counterfet mone. Ah deare God ([quoth] he) how vnhappy am I to lose my louing wife, my good wyfe, my sweet wife? O how happy were I, that as we haue lyued together, that we might nowe dye together. This pittyous sound of her husband, so melted the dying harte of Ophella , that lyke a Candle consumed, that leaueth a little smoke in the weeke, she lay both speechles,  & senceles, saue that the panges of death, sometymes threwe a weake breath out of her mouthe: but lyke vnto wilde fire, that burneth in water, the Corsiue, that would haue killed the deuill, in her case, recouered her to health, which was her husband, out of feare of her life, in dispight of the iniurie of time past, fell to kisse and coll his Maide, which watched his gasping wife, before hee tooke order wt the Clarke, to ring her knell: which Ophella , as dim as her sight was, perceiued, & Furie, which was the last motion, that accopanied her in life, like a whirl wind, yt with a suddaine violence, draweth things into the ayre, so fired her hart with malice, to see her husband in this iolity with her maide, as madnes, gaue her the strength to crye. Ah, ah, Traytour, I am not yet dead, ah villain, villaine, I am not yet dead: and through this passion, choller so dryed her Catar , as shortly after, she perfectly receyued her health: and so canuassed her husband Borrihauder , as by the motions of sorrow, & payne, he hung himselfe in a Crabtree: O quoth Katherina Trista, it was great dammage that Thymon of Athens was not in the town, to show al mallitious men that tree. The deuill might haue put in their myndes, to haue hanged themselues. This suddayne answeare of Katherina Trista ,   [  A cunnynge aunswere, taketh away the grace of a shrewd tale. ] tickled all the companye with a laughter, a good parte whereof, were reddy to scandall women, with a frowarde nature, beyng by this example, more fostered with dyspight, then good vsage: who, nowe for feare of theyr owne reproche, amplyfied not Master Doctors tale, with any other spightfull authorityes. For the Hystorie of Thymon of Athens dogged nature, was so well knowne to euerie Gentleman,   [  THYMON of Athens was the sworn enemie of humanitie. ] as the remembraunce of his name, assured them, that there neuer lyued woman of so frowarde a condityon: neyther is it possible, that euer any man agayne, shoulde be so great an enemye to Humanitie. And there vpon [[quoth] Falerio] Thymon of Athens was without heyre or successor, and therefore is no able example, to blame vs. Neither had Ophela (for any thinge we heare) either heyre or successor, (quoth Aluisa Vechio :) then, by your owne reason, is of no authoritie to slaunder our sexe. This one quip for an other (although more myldelye handled of the Gentlewomen side, accordinge to their naturall modestie) quieted either parte. In so moch as Doctor Mossenigo humbly desired to to be receiued, into the grace of women againe. Nay, [[quoth] Queene Aurelia ] you deserue to bee euereuermore banyshed the presences of women. Alas good Madam, (quoth he) I did but your commandement, and therupon I appeale to the report of the company. Yea, but (quoth she) my meanyng was otherwise. O Madame (quoth he) Subiects,   [  A dutiful subiect is bound to obay his Princes wordes, and not linger vpon the effect. ] are bounde to execute their Soueraignes woordes, and are not priueledged, to interpret their charge, to their owne fancy. I see well, [[quoth] Queene Aurelia ] that there is no dealyng with a Lawyer, for they can defend their owne trespasses, with the same sworde, they punish other mens offences, and therefore better to haue you a fayned friende, (being so daungerous) then an open enemie:   [  A fayned friend is better then a dangerous open enimy. ] wherefore, we pardon you. By this time, Supper, and euerie seruice of the Table ended. Whereuppon, Queene Aurelia, and the whole company rose, and saluting one an other, with a ciuill reuerence. The Musick sommoned the yonge Gentelmen, and Gentlewomen, to daunsinge: for (this night) they expected no other pastime, vnlesse it were dicing, carding, or such like vnthrifty sports. And therfore as the night grew on, or they waxed wearie, vntill the next mornyng they commytted one an other, a dio . FINIS. Contayning (with many other necessarie Questions,) a large Discouerie, of the inconueniences of forced Marriadges. Discription of the Sunne risinge. ] but that Phebus ashamed of his ouer drowsy sleeping, in the darke Caues of Tartessus : hastely harnesed vp his Horses, and in his fierie Chariot, clymed the Mountaine Oeta , the painefull trauell whereof made brighte, Pyrois and sparklinge Phlegon ,   [  Pyrois and Phlegon fained to be two of the Summer Coche horses ] breathe flambes lyke the burninge Furnace, wherein Vulcan forgeth the Thunderboltes of Iubiter : In so much as Phaebus golde rayes (which beautifieth the Heauens, and comforteth the earth) pearced through euerie small passadge, into Segnior Philoxenus Pallace: and glimmering in the yong Gentlemens faces, wakened them, with an imagination,   [  The Bed resembleth the Graue. ] of their Mistresses beauties (who scorning their Beds, as Graues which buried the one half of their pleasures, and the Cannapies, as Clowdes, that shadowed the brightnesse of their Loade Starres) now started vp, to honour and salute the Images, of their hartes delighte: and to waken the Ladies and Gentlewomen (who of the suddaine, could not be attyred) the tingling of a small Bell, gaue them warning of a Sermon. In so much, as by nine of the Clocke, Queene Aurelia , and her stately Attendants entered the Chappel, in such Equipage , as I think, the Preacher, Fryer Bugiardo , immagined our Lady was come from Loretto , [  Laureta, commonly called Loreto, the great pilgrimage of Italy where is a small Chappell, sometymes made, by the cunning of certaine Fryers, and the consent of some of the Cittizens of RACANATI: only, to bring Trafficke to their Cittie, destroyed by the Goathes, and Vandals: and in the night, stole it out of the Towne: and spread a rumoure, that our Ladye by Aungells, had brought it out of IVRY: the mansion House, wherin she ther liued: whych Fable, an nuber hold for a trueth. ] to honor Segnior Phyloxenus Aultar: and therefore to welcome her the more, he so extolled our Ladies vertues, and the good and pitifull woorkes of our Cannonyzed Matrons, and Uirgins: as if the Crown of Heauen, had stode vpon our Ladyes head, and that the earth (cheefely Italy) was blessed for pittyfull womens sakes: of whych, they could haue no greater testimonie, then that our Ladye by myracle, had possessed them, with her earthlye Mansion: which she dayly visiteth, with a thousand blessinges. And therfore, [quoth] he, repayre her Churches, cherish her Preestes, praye before her Aulters, and your sinnes, whatsoeuer, shallbe forgeuen: O she is pittifull, as a woman: and can rule her son, as a Mother: and with such lyke owld tales, and Tapers, he lighted the people, as they thought, to Heuen: but in verye trueth,   [  Ignoraunce Caue, the hye waye to Hell. ] into blinde Ignoraunce Caue; from whence, the deuill carryed them to Hell. Ismarito smiled, to heare the subtiltie of the Fryer, and sorrowed to see the simplicitie of the people, in causes that appertayne vnto the soule, who in the affaires of the flesh, are as wylye as Serpents:   [  Italians, a most subtyle kinde of people. ] whose countenaunce, when Philoxenus beheld, he pleasauntly demaunded, how Ismarito lyked Fryer Bugiardo his sermon. Ismarito merely aunsweared, it was pittie that Iudas had not harde the lyke, after he had betrayed his Maister Christ: it might haue ben, vppon these large promyses of forgiuenes, he wold not so desperatly haue hanged himself. Then quoth Philoxenus, these pleasing sermons be not vnnecessary in this countrie, where sinne is so grose: for were not the people in hope,   [ Sinne cannot indure to here of Gods Iustice. ] that our Lady, of pitty, wold pardon them, a number would followe Iudas in dispaire: with feare, that Gods Iustice would condemne them. It seemeth reason (quoth Ismarito ) that the people beleeue what is sayd in the Pulpit: for they vnderstand not what is read in the Church. In this especiall case (quoth Philoxenus ) all our crosses,   [  A tiranny ten tymes more cruell then Dennis Bull. ] are curses. So that our first restraint from reading the Scriptures, could not but come from as accursed a spirit as his, that first inuented the Turkes Alcaron , by the paine of the one, Mahomets Idolatry, is vnreprehended, and through our ignoraunce in the other, the Popes blaspheamye, is in vs vnespyed, and thereby, both God is dyshonoured, and manye a Soull distroyed:   [  A diuine blessing. ] so that happye, and thryse happye, are you of Englande , that haue the sacred Byble, and the hard passages of Scrypture, expounded in vulgar Language: that your common sorte, howesoeuer youre Prealates lyue, vnderstande wheather they erre or no in theyr Doctryne.

Do (gratious Queene Elizabeth) what shall seeme to you good: for your most blessed nature cannot erre, or do any thing amis that you purpose, who by diuine inspiration, hath vnlocked the fountaine of grace: so that the thirstye soules both of her rich and poore subiectes, may freelye drinke the water of lyfe. Segnior PHILOXENVS , so affected this speech, as ISMARITO coulde not, but imagyne, hys heart adiudged him, a straunger to Grace, and vnworthy lyfe, that was her vassaile and sayd not therevnto,   [  Reconciliatio may take away reuege, but not grudge from enimies harts ] Amen. The end of Fryar Buiardos clawing Sermon, broke off thys priuate talke, and the Gentlewomen, proude of the commendation, of their pytifull sexe, now wisshed, that Doctor Mossenigo had ben vnpardoned his yesternightes trespasse towards women: that the holy Frier, might haue cited him before our Ladie of Loretto : who, the greatter parte of Dinner time, left his victuelles to inlarge his Feminine prayses. In the ende, tasting ye goodnesse of the meate, he fownd prating verie vnsauerie: and therefore, to recouer his losses, his lippes layde on loade: which Falerio, and some other of the pleasaunt company perceiuiug, assayed to reward the Fryar for his good Sermon, with Tantalus dinner, and to that end, busied him with many questions, which he euer aunsweared in a monisillable , his feeding: As, ([quoth] Falerio ) a question or two, Master Fryer I pray? saye, quoth he: who strikes wyth the sharpest rod? God: of all other, who is most euill? Deuill: in distresse, who deserueth most rueth? Trueth: who is charged with most cryme? Tyme: what houlds the worlde in most imprice? Uice: who is the greatest lyer? Fryer: Desier: without flame, what maketh the greatest fire? Ire: what sin is most accurst? Lust: what bread is best to eat? Wheat: what drink is worst for the eyne? Wine: When they could deuise no talke, to put lyfe in ye Fryars tongue, doctour Mossenigo demaunded, why he was so breefe, in his aunsweares? O (quoth he) Pauca sapienti : Then ([quoth] the Doctor) it is good taking awaye, this plenty of meat, for cloying Fryar Buiardoes wit. The hole company, hearing the Fryar beaten with hys owne sentence, tourned into a contrary sence, burst out into suche an immoderate laughter, as choller that rose to the very throat of ye Friar would not suffer him to swallowe, one bitt more of meat: in somuch, as the boord was taken awaye, and the Friar driuen to saye Benedicite , with an emptye stomacke: an intertaynment, as fit for a flatterer, as a reward for a faythful seruaunt. [  A good reward for Flaterie. ] The office of courteous reuerence, fully discharged: the company retyred towards the fyre, to pause a little after their dinner, obseruing therein an olde health rule. Afrer dynner, talke a while, After supper, walke a mile. Where the pittifull Gentlewomen, moaned the dysgrace of their prayse Master, the Fryar, but murmured more that he was crossed (without a blessing) by theyr enemye, the Doctor. And to put them out of this matter, Bargetto sayde merrily, that the Fryar had taught hym such a cunning way to woo, as to melt a woma into pitty, he woulde wish, but the oportunitie of three howres: two to loue, and one to prayse the thing they lyke. Yea (quoth Franceschina Santa , his Mistres, since women are so mercyfull, it is necessary to brydle the subtilty of men: and to giue example, I enioyne you, these three dayes to speake no more of loue: And questionlesse, thys payne set vppon Bargettos head, was no greater then his ouersight deserued: for in doing of these three thinges, is great daunger, and smal discression: to play with fire: to striue with water: and to giue a woman knowledge of our power:   [  A profitable Note. ] therfore, he that will discouer his owne secreat aduauntage, is worthy to haue his heyre cutt with Sampson . Queene Aurelia , by this time was reddy to walke into the drawing chamber, to continue her established exercise: and for the execution thereof, shee called certayne of her chosen Attendats, (whose appearance being made,) to obserue her former course: for auncient customs profitable, are better then new lawes incertaine, shee commaunded the Eunuk , to set their witts in an order, by the vertue of some sweete harmony, who, taking his Lute, after a dutifull obaysaunce, played, and sunge, this followinge Sonnet, in Italon . I finde Repose, in Fancies fetters bounde: Amyd the Skies, my wysh I often meete: And yet I lye, fast staked to the grownde: My eye sees Ioy, my hart is grypde with payne, I know my hurt, and yet my good refrayne. But how thease hang, the faithfull Louer knowes, And yet can geeue, no reason for the cause: The power of Loue, mans reache so farre out goes, As bownd [perfore] he yealdes to Cupids Lawes, And yet we finde, this Libertie in Loue, As bard from Ioye, Hope doth our griefes remooue. Then Loue sitte crownd, as Soueraigne of my thought, And Fancie see, thou other motions chace, To do whose wyll, Desire in me hath wrought, A strength to ronne, in Gyues, sweete Pelops race, And those to charme, that studie me to staye, It may suffise: the wisest paaste my way. The double effectes of this Sonet, made them freshly to remember the doubtes, they left yesterday vnresolued. And to avoyde degression, whiche rayseth many difficulties, and resolueth few: Queene Aurelia , caused a Repeticion of Platoes opinion of Mariage : which was: She was a Paradice on earth, where her Statutes were kept: and a Hell in the House, where her lawes were broken . Wherevpon ([quoth] Dondolo with the libertie of Queene Aurelias fauour) I demaunde the cause? why that the Male, and Female, of bruite and wilde creatures loue, cherish & take comfort, in one anothers companie, onelie by the Impression of nature: and man and woman, that are bewtified both with the vertues of nature and reason, manie times matched together, make a hell, of this holie institution. By Queene Aurelias commaudement, to aunswere.   [  Reason giueth man souerainty ouer al creatures. ] Sir ([quoth] Faliero ) The aduantage of reason, with which you haue preuiledged man and woman, is the onelie cause thereof no man will denie, but that there is a difference of conditions, in creatures of euerie kynde: some horse,   [  There is diuersitie of codition in euery kinde. ] an vnskilfull horseman, can hardly disorder; & some in dispite of his rider will haue a iadish tricke. Some Hauke though shee bee euill serued, will not stragle foorth: and some, do the Faulkener what he can, wil continuallie flie at checkes: some hound by no meanes wil be rated from riote, and some will neuer forsake, his vndertaken game: euen so some man will filch if his handes be fast bounde, and some hauing the aduantage of a bootie, will rather stearue, then steale: some woman, with an houres libertie will offende,   [ Reason findeth out the imperfection of nature. ] and tenne yeares louing sute can not ouercome some other. But the vice, & vertue in euery creature, by the opinions of manie sage Phylosophers, proceedeth from the purenesse, or the imperfection of natures which is not to be founde, but by reason: and the vse of reason onelie belongeth to man: Now,   [  Cause of mistaking in mariage. ] if by ouersight in choice, the maried, are deuided in desire, differ in life, and delight in neithers loue: Reason that findeth out this contrarietie, soweth contention betweene that vnfortunate couple in Matrimonie thus matched. is equalitie, of byrth, yeares, and manners, no difference in loue, nor suspition of others behauiour: Reason that delighteth in vnitie, maketh the Ioyes of Mariage innumerable. Therefore (thinke I) the opinion of Plato maye bee imbraced as a sounde iudgemente. The whole assemblye, allowed Falieroes reason: And Dondolo hymselfe was reasonably well satisfied. But quoth he, since Mariage bringeth wt her vnspeakable Ioy, or vncurable sorrow: How may a man assure himselfe of the one or avoide the other? when a womans vnsearcheable hart, is the only harbour both of her good and euil coditions: and (once) in appearance, the honourable, and the dishonest, the vertuous, and the vicious: and in breefe, euery sorte of Women, are naturally beautifyed with modestie. If the good repulse dishonest request with chaste disdaine, the badde with counterfet sobryetie, will blush at incontinent sutes: If the good vseth silence as a vertue, the bad with well ordered speach, will be as highly esteemed: If the good with the beautie and benefites of Nature, delighte: the bad with the florish of Arte, will no lesse be fantasied. So that, at the first face, the cunningest Clarke may bee deceiued, in iudginge who best deserueth. The greatest Clarke ([quoth] Faliero ) proues not alwaies the wisest man, and none more apt to be beguiled then he He valueth all, that glistereth, Golde: he esteemeth fayre wordes, as friendly deeds: and thinketh that louely countenaunces, doo spring from a louyng condition.   [  Experience is the best Iudge. ] When experience knowing the contrarie, will trie them all by the test. The corruptest Canker, bloometh lyke the sweetest Eglantine: the bitter Bullice, resembleth the pleasaunt Damson, and the sowre Crab, the sauorie Pippin. Euen so good and bad,   [  The forme deceiueth, but the qualytie sheweth the creature. ] faire and fowle, chaste and vnconstaunt, Women are made of one moulde, framde of one forme, and naturaly graced, with a shamfast blushing, but as in smell the Cankar, in tast the Bullice, and the Crab in relysh, bewray their imperfections, euen so with cunning vsage, the subtillest woman, will shew her vnnaturall conditions: counterfeits will to hinde: Copper holds print, but not touch with Gold: Fire hid in Ashes, will breake foorth in heat: water courses stopt, find out new passages: euen so the impatient woman, throwly moued, discloseth her passions: the prowde with sufferaunce, exceedeth in pompe, and the wanton sore charged, will fall to folly. Well ([quoth] Dondolo ,) notwithstanding your directions be good, yet the pathe to heauen, is so difficult to fynde, as the ignoraunt passenger without direction, is like to follow the beaten waye to Hell, and the surest guide is Experience: So that the direction of the Parents,   [  The foresight of Parentes. ] is to be imbraced of the Chyldren in this behalfe. Parents with regarde, foresee the euils that negligent Children, feele ere they withstand: Parents prouide liuing, to mainetaine their Childrens looue. Children often times by matching with beggers, diminish theyr parents inheritaunce. Parents labour for necessaries to support an househoulde. Children onely seeke for silken ragges, to vpholde their pride. Parents haue care to matche their Children with those of vertuous condition: and Children lightly regarde no more then their loouers amiable countenaunce. I confesse with you ([quoth] Faliero ) the ouersights of yonge   [  A reprehension of forced Mariage. ] men in their choyce, but I crye out vppon forcement in Marriage, as the extreamest bondage that is: for that the raunsome of libertie is ye death of the one or ye other of the married. The father thinkes he hath a happy purchase, if he get a riche young Warde to match with his daughter: But God he knowes, and the vnfortunate couple often feele, that he byeth sorrow to his Childe, slaunder to himselfe, and perchaunce, the ruine of an auncient Gentlemans house, by the riot of the sonne in Lawe, not loouing his wife. But admit there be no disagreement betweene the parties, which is rather fortune then foresight, in parentes, who regarde that the landes and goods be great, but finally waye, whether the beauty and behauiours please or no: yet looue enforste, taketh knowledge neither of freendes,   [  Loue will not be constrained. ] fauour, forme, goods nor good bringing vp. Delicate meate, hardely forceth an appetite vnto the sycke. Pleasure yieldes no sollace to the sorrowfull, no more can forcement enforce the free to fancie. The Lyon with gentlenes may be tamed, but with curstnes neuer conquered: much more lordly is Loue , for as Petrarke deuyneth. The Prince, the Peere, the Subiect and the slaue, Loue giues with care, to him they make their mone And if by chaunce, he graunt the grace they craue, It comes of ruthe, by force he yeeldes to none. I could report many examples of large authoritie,   [  The euil of tediousnes. ] to prooue this inconuenience, but to a needelesse ende: for tediousnes duls the remembraunce of the hearer, and tyres the tongue of the Reporter. In dayly action, you may vew the libertie of Loue , his contempt to be constrained, and the great compassion he vseth when he is with curtesie acquired, which account, inforced Mariage is sildome considered. There is procurement of freendes before plightmet of faith: safety for liuinges before assuraunce of loue, and clapping of handes before knitting of hartes: an occasion that the sorrowfull partyes morne when they are Married, and reioyse when by death they are seuered. Dondolo replyed, that when there is no remedy Reason will driue them to Loue . But Faliero maintayned,   [  Reason and Loue, are enemies. ] that Reason and Loue , are at deadely foode: Reason byds thee looue, but where thou art lyked, and Loue byds thee fancie where thou art hated: Reason directes for thy benefit, and Loue allures to thy detryment: and to conclude, the office of Reason is to appease olde greefes, and the nature of Loue is to raise new debates. Tush, tush, ([quoth] Bargetto ,) among the married, quarrels in the day, are qualified with kisses in the night: wherevpon groweth this Adage. The jangling wordes, that Louers vse in rage: Giues Loue a grace, when anger dooth asswage. A wytnesse that Vnkindnesse inlargeth Loue , as the wracke of Winter dooth the beautie of Summer: then, although the Parents matche at first, be without the fancie of the Children, a reconciliation (in fine) will double their comforte. Sir ([quoth] Soranso , fauouring Falieros opinion) you wrest:   [  An other reprehension of forcement in mariage ] the Adage is to a cotrary meaning: for it is to be vsed but where there hath beene sometyme perfect loue, and where a grounded loue is, although the Married menace with their tunges, they malice not with their hartes: on the contrarie parte: looke what rule the Louer vseth in loue, the Enemie obserueth in reuenge. Therefore if the Maried abhorre before Marriage, they may well desemble with their tounges, but wyll neuer bee delighted in their harts: and where there is such a deuision in the desires of the Married, fayre, fained semblaunce, wil soone turne to flat fowle falling out: their thrift goeth forwarde as the carriage drawen by two Oxen, taile to taile: the Husband wyll haue no delight to get, nor the Wife desyre to saue: Seruauntes with negligence will waste, and hyrelinges, with proloyning, will winne: and (which is worst) the continuaunce of mallice, will custom them with mortall hatred: hatred betweene the Married, breedeth cotencion betwixt the parents, cotencion betwixt the parets, raiseth quarrels among the kindred, & quarrels amog the kindred, occupieth all the neighbours with slauder: so yt for the most part, these forced Mariages, engendereth sorrowes for the Married, disquietnesse to both their freends & kindred: but which still renueth greefe, the scandall of enemyes, endeth in neyther of theyr wretchednesse. This beeing said, lyttle auayled the further prooffes, of the contrary part, so full was the crie: Fye of forcement in Mariage , so that to paint out, the inconueniences therof in his proper coulours, Queene Aurelia comaunded Faliero , to confirme his sufficient reasons, with the discourse of some rare Historie. Whose commaundement he willingly satisfied, and reported as followeth. Marchaunt named Tryfo . This Tryfo had a wealthy neighbour called Clearches , who of long time entertained one an other with a neighborly affection Tryfo to inherite all his liuings, had but one onely sonne, named Sicheus : and Clearches one onely Daughter called Elisa . The Parents to establish (as they imagined) an euerlasting amitie, betweene theyr houses, concluded a Mariage for theyr vnfortunate Children: making no doubt, but that they would as well inherite theyr affections, as theyr liuings: of which there was hope enough, if the order had beene as good to establish theyr Loue , as the haste great, to sollemnize the Mariage : for that in theyr persons, appeered no signe of disagreement, nor in theyr abilyties cause of exception: but looue (that behouldeth no more quicknesse in a Dyamond , then in a dim Saphyre ) though he take impression by sight,    [  Looue rooteth by Contemplation. ] rooteth in contemplation: which deuine exercise of the soule, smally delighteth green Youthe , who intertaine their thoughts with a thousand vaine fancies: but to my purpose. The Mariage day drew neare: and as at the very push of Battell, the wise Captaine animateth his Souldiers, with some plausible Oration, euen so the night before the Mariage, Trifo schooled his sonne Sicheus , with this following aduertisement. My good sonne quod he,   [  Aduise to a booteles purpose. ] so great are the follyes of men, and so cunning the deceits of women, as the most (especially the yonger sorte) wyll credite theyr lookes, without looking into their liues: beleeue their woordes, and lightly regard their workes: delyght to recount theyr entertainements, and disdaine to reckon theyr shrewde payments. For as the sycke pacient, comforted with the Phisitions words, leaues to examine the quallities of his receites: Eue so, the wretched Louer ,   [ Looue yeelds neither to wyt, strength nor learning. ] cured with the yeelding of his beautifull Mistrisse, with negligence, bothe ouer lookes his owne benefit, & her behauiour. Salomon was deceyued, Sampson subdued, Aristotle derided, and Hercules murthered, by the illusions of errant honest women. Kinge Demetrius ,   [  An extreame affection. ] notwithstanding he was bothe wise and valiant, was so bewitched with the wyles of the notorious strumpet Lamia , as in open Schooles, he raysed disputations, whether the loue he bare Lamia , or the Iewels he bestowed vpon her, were the greater: or whether her merrit exceeded them bothe or noe. Yea when she died he caused her to be Intombed vnder his Bed Chamber windowe, to the ende, that with dayly teares he might worship her engraued bones, who (liuing) was of him intirely belooued. If the wisest, and the worthyest, be thus ouertaken in their affections, what easie baites may beguile thee, who in yeares art young, of substaunce delicate and lustie, and therefore apt to looue: reddy in conceyt, and of consideration vnperfect: whot in desire, and in discretion colde: My sonne, by experience I know, and to preuent thy ouerlikely mischaunce in choyce: I haue chosen thee a wife, fayre to please thee, ritche to continue looue, her Parents my assured freendes, and she thy affected loouer: loue her well, beare with her in small faultes, as a woman and the weaker, & bridle thy owne euill affections as a man, her head and gouernour: and in thus dooing, God will multiply his blessings vpon you, and make your aged Parents to dye in peace, to see you liue in prosperitie. Young Sicheus regarded his Fathers tale, as Schollers doo their Tutors , who giuing them leaue to playe, admonisheth them with all, to keepe good rule, which they promise, and performe the contrary. With the like affection, Sicheus embraced Mariage . He was not so soone wearie of dallying with his Wife, as he was ready to entertayne a Harlot: so that in shorte space, he became a common Louer , and a carelesse Husband: and withall, grew as arrogant in defending his libertie, as dissolute in his actions and behauiour: If his freends did gently aduise him,   [  The title of Mariage, maketh youthe arrogant. ] he was of age to counsell himselfe: if his Parents did sharply reprehend him, he would impudently aunswer, he was past correction: if his Wife found her selfe agreeued with his hard vsage, she might well complaine, but he would take no time to amend: so that his dayly actions of euill, tooke away all after hope of weldooing: in so much as he became odious vnto his freends, that beheld his lewde inclination: and a plague vnto his Wife, who was dayly oppressed, with his monstrous vices. So that, the ouercharge of sorrow made her many times passage, for these and such like passions. O vnhappie and ouer hastie Mariage , which in the pride of my youthe, with discontentments, makest me resemble a fayre Fig Tree , blasted with the after colde, of an vntimely Spring :   [  Abuse of good things, worke euill effectes. ] but why blame I Mariage, which is honourable? alas, because the abuse of good things, worke euill effectes: Roses vnaduisedly gathered, pryck our hands: Bees vngently vsed stinge our faces, yet the one pleasaunt, and the other profitable: so that if their come any euil of that which is good, our folly or fortune is cause thereof: Aye me, when I was married, I was to young to be a wife, and therefore haue no reason to exclayme on folly. But Fortune , fowle falle thee, which crossest me with cursses,   [  That which is blessing to one, may be a curse to an other. ] in possessing me with those things, which others holde for blessings: Wealth , that bestoweth pleasures on many, is the orriginall of my woe. Mariage , which giueth lybertye to many, inlargeth my Fetters, and demaundeth death for my raunsome: Beautie that aduaunseth many, is to me a disgrace: for that, inioying her forme,   [ Carlesnesse of the husband breedeth hate in the vvife. ] I am of Sicheus not fantasied, of whom euery foule and common Trull is belooued: But therein, Fortune , thou doost me no wronge, for my hate towards him, ouerpayseth his light regarde of me. O but my hart is continually afflicted with his euill, and his finger neuer akes with my mallice. Yea: Forberaunce edgeth the sword of Reuenge , when Choller , though it often strikes, it woundes not muche. Raine falleth euery where, yet beateth but the leaues, the thunder Bowlt lighteth in one place, but yet teareth vp the rootes: so though I dissemble tyll oportunitie, Sicheus shall feele my hate to death: and though I endure a space, I will redeeme my dying life: and perseuering in this resolution, Elisaes thoughts, that were lately drowned in sorrow, now flamed with desyre of Reuenge : and the Deuill who is the Executioner of Vengeance ,   [  The Diuell is the Executioner of vengeaunce. ] presented her foorthwith this vngratious meane. A Yonge Gentleman, named Chion, among a troupe of other Ladyes and Gentlewomen, beheld fayre Elisae , with such a burning affection, as he foorthwith dispossessed his owne hart, to make his bosome the seate of her imagined Image: so that his soule, that continually eyed her beautie, and his heart, at the direction of his Mistresse, gaue such a heate to his desire, that had he beene sure to haue receiued Ixions torments, for his ambitious attempting of Iunoes loue, he could neither haue left to loue,   [  An extreame passion of Loue. ] nor haue forborne to seeke for grace: so that follow what would, he foorthwith presented his affections, in this ensuing Letter. to make me loue: the discouerie of my blasing affections, would melt you, (were you a Mountaine of Ice) to pitty. But for that Loue is more vehement in the heart, then in the tongue, I appeale to your owne motions for grace, if you haue euer loued: if not, I hope for such iustice at Venus handes, as you shall loue: and yet thus much I saye, although I affye nothing in my perswations, because they be but wordes. I presume of my indeuours, for that I haue vowed my life, to death, to do you seruice: of which you can haue no better assuraunce, then imployement, nor I a hyer fauor, then to be imployed. Good Madame, martir me not, with ordinary doubts, in that my affections are not ordinary. For as your beautye excelleth all other Dames, as the fayre Rose eache Garden Flower, euen so the full power of loue, hath made me in the estate of flaming flaxe, that is, presently to receiue grace, or in a moment to perish. Thus longing for your sweete aunswer, I somewhat succour my torments, with the imagination, that I kisse your gratious hand. No more his owne Chion . This Letter sealed, and subscribed, was delyuered to so cunning a Messenger as needed no instructions in Chions behalfe. The Letter presented, and aduisedly reade by Elysa, surprised her with an vnmeasurable ioye: not so much for that she had purchased her self a faithfull Loouer, as procured her Husband a mortall enemy: of which Chions Letter gaue her not so great assuraunce, as the disposition of his countenaunces,   [  A naturall feare in a vvoman, suppresseth many of their euill affections. ] in a former regarde: and thervppon pursuing Sicheus with more hate, then minding Chion with affection, she mused vppon an number of mischeefes, inuented by desyre to be reuenged, and suppressed by feare to be defamed. In fine, remembring, that she had read: Loue quickeneth a mans wit, although it burieth Reason : To trie, if he could define, what Seruice she desired: she retourned Chion a Briefe, wherin he had a light to mischiefe, and yet might be read, without bleamysh of her honour: the Effect wherof, was this. Whyle CICHEVS doth lyue: ELISA can not loue. CHION, receyued this Scrowle: But yet before he presumed to reade the Contents, he kissed and rekissed the same: houldyng an opinion, that commyng from his Mistresses handes, it deserued suche honour (althoughe it contayned Sentence of his death:   [  An example for Christian Subiectes. ] not vnlyke the foolishe Mahometians : who vpon their Emperours Commaundementes, are ready Executioners of their owne lyues: But to my purpose: when Chion had throughly pervsed this strange Aunswere: Cicheus his heauy Destinie, or a iust Scourge, for his sore trespasses: (accursed that he was) he became too iust an Executioner of Elisaes wicked wil: but yet with this interpretation, that the loue she bare her Husband, directed her in this answer. In so much, as, ouercom with a furious hate towards Cicheus , as the Barre of his welfare, lyke a Lyon that bites the Iron grate, which houlds him from his pray: sodenly with this salutation, he sheathed his Sword in Cicheus intrayles. CICHEVS shall not lyue, To hinder CHIONS loue. The fact, was so fowle, and withall so publique,   [  Wilful faults deserue no pardon. ] as the Officers of Iustice, immediatly seased vpo Chion : & for yt his bloodie sword, was a witnes of the trespas, there was no Plea to saue him: for wilfull faultes may be pitied, but deserueth no pardon: and to say trueth, neither did he desire to lyue, because ELISA , the vertue of his lyfe, by the charge of Lawe, was bownd to sue him to death: who followed the processe, with an apparance of sorrow, suche as if her Conscience had bene without scruple of guiltinesse, or her harte a thowsande degrees from ioye: when God knowes, she was puffed with the one, and the other, so that the wonder, at her dissimulation, equalled the reproche of her notorious hatred. To be shorte,   [  A fauour euil bestowed. ] this was the Iudges sentence: Chyon should be beheaded, as amends for Cicheus death, and the Widdow should be endowed with his goods, for the dammage done vnto her: but God which knoweth our seacret faultes (when Iudges though they rule as Gods, know,   [ This Iudge is not parciall, for fauor, gain or feare. ] but what they heare and see as men) not willynge to hide such an haynous offence. First, amased all the hearers, with an vnknow voice, Elisaes harte, is as Gyltie, as Chions hand : and therewithal, thundred this following vengeance, vppon the cleared malefactor. The Infant in Eysaes wombe, as it were engendred of the Parents malyce, at the verie instaunt, not obeying the course of Nature, so tyrannised her Intrailes, as with very agony she dyed, and with all remayneth an opinyon, that the Husband, Wife, and Sonne, by the appointment of the Gods, were Metamorphosed into Vipers , whiche venimous Beastes are thrall to these curses. The female after shee hath engedred ,   [  The curses geuen vnto a Viper. ] murdreth the Male, because she wil not be ruled as an inferiour: and the yong eate themselues, forth of their Dams Intrailes: because they wil not be bound to the obedience of Nature . Well quoth Soranso ) though your Metamorphos bee vnlykly, yet is it not vnnecessarilye applyed. For, for the most part, those which are forced to Mariage , agree little better then Uipers. But it seemeth to mee ( Segnior Faliero ) you haue too fauourably reported this Historie in Elysaes behalfe, considering the mortal venyme she tempered in her harte.   [  Breuitie is best in passionate matters, and effectatio, in pleasaunt ] O (quoth Faliero ) longe fowle wayes, both tyreth the Horse, and wearieth his Ryder, where both the one, and the other, ouercommeth the length of fayre passages, with pleasure: Euen so, in a ruthfull Historie, ouer plentie of wordes, both greeueth the reporter, and giueth meane for a thousande sighes to breake from the hearer, where affected circumstances giue a grace to a pleasant tale.   [  Sorrowes causeth scilence. ] Sorow to heare their kinde thus stayned with crueltye, locked vp the tonges of the poore Gentlewome a pretie while. In the end ([quoth] Aluisa Vechio , a dame more olde, & bold then the rest,   [  We are boud to showe aswell the cause as to punnish the euill. ] ) meseemeth that Faliero hath but little fauoured Elysa , for he hath showen her euill, and the scourge of her euill: and in charitie, he was bounde to shewe the cause of her euill: I would quoth (Doctour Mossenigo ) that Frier Bugiardo , had hearde this disputation, it might haue ben the breaking downe of the Altar,   [  Good morralitie, is better then euill doctrine. ] wherevpon he but lately committed blasphemie, woulde haue more reformed him, then his pleasing Sermon, could haue confirmed vs. These aduantages the Doctor tooke to crosse the Gentlewomen, his late open enemies, and but nowe his fained friendes:   [  There is no shiftinge of a reconcyled enemye. ] not vnlike a sneaking dog, that neuer barkes but bites withall. And to spite them the more, quoth hee, Monsier Bergetto, since your are bound from speaking of loue. you haue both cause and oportunitie to talke of womens hate. Pardon me (quoth Bergetto ) for this penance was but   [  The example of a naughtye nature. ] a due payne for my presumption, which I hope to ouercome with patient suffering: and sure in this milde aunswere: Bergetto shewed a moral vertue, and Doctor Mossenigo ,   [  A necessarie note. ] by his malicious question, a canckred nature: for simplie to offend proceedeth of frailtie, but to perceauer in euill is a noate of wilfull frowardnesse. Well, notwithstanding Bergettos temperaunce, a Caueler caught hold vppon this question, as a Mastiue vppon an old drye Mariebone,   [  A Caueller hath colours for euerie question. ] & to proue a womans hatred more greater then her loue: hee auouched manye cruell authorities. But Faliero , who had donne them some iniurie in reporting the late history made them part of amends, & put their aduersarie to silence in prouing the contrary: his reason was, that their hate, in the extremest degree, stretched, but to the death of another, and their loue many times; hath done wilful murder vpon them selues. Then it followeth,   [  Wemes loue, is more great the theyr hate ] by how much we pryse our selues aboue an other, by so muche, theyr loue is greater then theyr hatred. Yea (quoth the Doctor) but their loue and hatred,   [  Weme do amis, but men are the cause. ] are both violents: and euery violent is an euill. Yea Master Doctor (quoth Maria Belochy ) their euills are the greater for men, for by their flattering enchauntments, wemen loue immoderately,   [  Beauty ouercommeth the wisest. ] and stung with mens vnsufferable iniuries, they hate mortally. The Doctor replied, there was more power in her lookes, then authoritie in her wordes: but least he should be subdued by the one, he would not contend with the other. Why (quoth Queene Aurelia ) beauty workes no more impression, in a Doctors eye, then doth poyson, in Mineruas sheelde, for he by Philosophy can subdue affection. Madame (quoth he) you may well compare beauty and poyson together,   [ EVRIPIDES comparison, betweene Beauty and Loue. ] for their operations, are a lyke: saue that beauty is the more extreame, in that she infectes with her lookes, and poyson not, vnlesse wee taste it: or when it is most strong, not vnlesse we touch it: yea, Euripides , compareth her inchauntement, with the inticementes of a kingdome, whereas he saith. Or else to worke the fayre to their will, (So sweetely tastes the grace of either gayne, As) men ne dread, their friendes with foes to kyll: The reason is, controulment shrinkes the place, Whereas a Kyng, as soueraigne Iudge doth sit, In loue, because that reason lackes his grace, For to restrayne, the selfe conceyghtes of wit, So that God knowes, in daunger standes his lyfe: That is a King, or hath a fayre wife. To deale in Princes affayres, the companye was too greene: but in Beauties behalfe, there was neither Gentleman, nor Gentlewoman, that was not desirous to bee reuenged of the Doctours detractyon: for hee that hath a slaunderous tonge iniurieth manie, and is himselfe hated of all men:   [ sclaunder is generally hated. ] but for that it was nowe to late, too decide any other great question, Queene Aurelia adiorned the ending of anie controuersie, vntill the next day. By a secreate foreknowledge of a Maske, with which Soranso, Bargetto, Ismarito , and others, purposed to honour Segnior Phyloxenus , and his company Supper, was hastned, & soone ended: and after the one had saluted the other, with an accustomed reuerence: while the rest of the Gentlemen interteined Time, with dauncing, or deuising with their Mistresses, the Maskers withdrew themselues, and about nine of the clocke, in this disguise, presented themselues agayne. A consort of sweete Musycke, sounded the knowledge of their comming: ye Musitians, in Gyppons and Venetians, of Russet and Blacke Taffata ,   [  A Gentleman is not to shoe his passions, by his attyre. ] bended with Murrey , and thereon imbroadered this Posie. Spero, Timeo, Taceo : expressing thereby, the sundrye passions of Loue: and before them two Torchbearers, apparelled, in Yallowe Taffata Sarcenet : the Generall apparell of the Maskers, was short Millaine Cloaks, Dublet and hose, of Grene Satten : bordered with Siluer: Greene Silcke stockes: White Scarpines: Rapiers and Daggers syluered: Blacke Veluet Cappes , and white Feathers . They agreed to be thus attyred,   [ Men in many cases are to be priuiledged, for an others merrite. ] to showe themselues free. in the eye of the world, and couertly bound vnto their Mistresses. Ismarito for courtisy sake, because he was a stranger, and withal, in that his Mistres was the most honourable, had the leading of this Maske, who lighted with a torch, by his Page, apparelled in Blue Carnation ,   [  Ventoie Fan. ] and whyte Taffata : the colours of his Mistres: entred with a Ventoy in his hand, made like an Ashe tree : wrethed about with Iuye : expressing this posye: Testante virebo : with which, vpon fit oportunitie, he presented Queene Aurelia , his Mistresse: within which, weare couertly hid these verses in English Italion . Long mortal foes, accorded are of late. And now the one, dwels in my Mistresse eye, And in her hart the other keepes her state. Where both to show the vertue of this peace, To garnysh her, make riot of their Grace: In her fayre eye, Dame Beautie doth increace, A thousande Gleames, that doo become her face. And with her harte, thus doth the other deale, She lowly seemes, and mountes throw chast disdaine, So that her thrales doo serue with honest zeale, Or fearing blame, doe yeelde vnto their paine. The heauenly soules, enuies the earthes renowne: Such gyftes deuine, in humayne shape to see, And loue still moues, a Goddesse her to crowne: Which is decred, when Nature shall agree. Thus happy I [in Fortunes frownes long whyrld] A Goddesse serue, and soueraigne of the world. Carnation and Whyte , followed Ismarito , hauing the mouth of his Mask closed with a small Golden Lock , as a witnesse of the true execution of his Mistresse Commaundement: and vpon hys fist hee caried a Parrate to pratle to his Mistresse, vppon pausing betweene euery solemne Almayne , and couertlye vnder the Parrats winge, was hidden this passion. Hence burnyng sighes, which sparckle from desyre, To pitty melt my Mistresse frosen Hart: Her frosen hart, that Fancy cannot fyre, Nor true intent, perswade to rue my smart. Haste, haste, I pray, the Icye passage breake, And pleade for him, that is forbid to speake. What though at first, you faile to calme her rage, Yet as the Sunne, from earth doth draw the Rayne, Your vertues so, the stormes of scorne may swage, Or feede Desyre, with showers of disdayne. For euen as drink, dooth make the Dropsey drye, So colde disdaine, compels Desyre to frye. Her wyll be done, but I haue sworne to loue, And with this vow, will nourish my delight: Her scorne, my woe, nay, time may not remoue, A faithful zeale out of my troubled spright. Yea more then all, Ile Sacrifice my blood, And fyre my bones, to doe my Mistresse Good. next that presented him selfe: who vppon his left side, had a Harte , of Crymson Granado Silke , so artificyally made  & fastened to his dublet, as if his body had opened, and his hart appeered, which fell downe at his Mistresse feete, vpon such a Fortune, as she was bounde to take it vp, which opened, she might beholde the Picture of her selfe, reading this submission. Retires him selfe, with sighes to solace greefe: And with warme teares, his gored sides doth bath, But finding mone, to render small releefe: Impatient Beast, he giues a heauy Bray, And hasts the Death, that many woulde delay. So I whose Loue, beyond my hap doth mount, Whose thoughts as Thornes, yet prick me with Desire: Whose sute and zeale, return's with no accompt: Whose hope is drye, set in a harte of Fyre: Holde this for ease, foorthwith to spoyle the eye, That lookte and lou'de, then in dispaire to dye. A happy Doome, if it for Law might stande, But men condemd, them selues may not dispatch. Their lyues and deathes, are in their Soueraignes hand So myne in hers, whose Lookes did me attache: And therfore I, to pardon or to kyll, Must yeald my selfe, the Prysoner of her wyll. A fettred thralle, attyred with disgrace, And at thy feete, his wounded hart here see, And in the same, the Image of thy face? Whiche bleding fresh, with throbs throwes foorth his mone, Rueth, rueth, deare Dame. for that I am your owne. Taffata , was the fourth: who vppon his Breast, bare a Myrrour, set the outeside inwarde, and yet fastened so slope as it might receiue light, with an Imagination, that he showed his Hart, the Beautie of his Mistresse,  & in ye thought, he wrot vpon the out side: Basta che spero : within whiche glasse, this sonet was coningly couated: which vpo a fit oportunitie he presented vnto his Mistresse, Lucia Bella . From meddowes faire, amid the craggie rocke, Loue doth me leade, I know not whether I, But euermore a passage doeth vnlocke. Nowe doe I fight, now weepe, now death I feare, In all these stormes, yet loue the healme doth steare. In desert woods I wander to and fro, Where I wilde beastes, and firie Serpentes meete. Yet safe I passe, Loue doth direct me so. In tempestes rough, my barke doth alwayes fleete, Yea, when Sunne, Moone, and starres forsake the skie, Loue giues me light, from my faire Mistresse eye. I mount to heauen, I know not with what winges I sinke to hell, yet drowne not in distresse: Twixt Ice and flame, Loue mee in safetie bringes, But to what end? in sooth I cannot gesse: Yet hap what shall, Loue giueth me this scope, In daungers mouth, to liue alwaies in hope. greene Taffeta , was the fifte  & last that entred: who (as yf she were climynge vp his Arme) caryed a whyght Turtle , so artifyciallye made, as it deceyued, no lesse, then Parrhasius paynted Table Clothe: In whose Beake, were fynely rowled these Uerses. One langour sweete, one wish desire dooth moue: If honest Zeale, a gentle breast doth lawde. If wanderyng long, in the Lab'rinth of Loue, If wan pale cheekes, are witnesses of woe. If reaking sightes, throwne from a burnyng harte: If all these, and thousand sorrowes moe: May charme Mistrust, and make you rue my smart. Faire Mistresse, looke but in my Meagre face, And you shall reade, that I haue neede of Grace. In this order, and with these deuises, the Maskers entred, and after they had saluted Queene Aurelia , and the honourable of the company, they placed themselues, some of the one side, of the greate Chamber, and some of the other, obseruynge therein a more discreate order then the ordynary Maskers: who at their first entraunce, either daunce with them selues, or rudelye sease vppon the Gentlewomen: but these Maskers, intertained a smal Tyme, with their Musick, while they had leasure to looke about, and espie who were the worthyest amonge the Ladies. In the ende, Ismarito kyssing his hand, with a Countenaunce abased, humbly desired Queene Aurelia , to do him the grace, to daunce wt him. Next, Bergetto made choice of Franceschina Santa : after him, Soranso , chewsed, Maria Belochi: Dondolo , raysed Lucia Bella : and last of all, Faliero , tooke his Mistresse Catharina Trista : and thus, they obserued in their choyce, the same course they kepte in their entrance. After this Companie had performed all the ciuill Seruices of Maskers, leauyng behinde them, their Mistresses honoured, and the whole companie much contented: they departed in the good order they entred: sauyng that their Mistresses were possessed with their seuerall Deuices. Which done, the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen began to shrinck out of the great Chamber, as the Starres seeme to shoote the Skie, towardes the Breake of Daye. FINIS. Contayning: sundrie Morall Preceptes: With a large Discouerie, of the inconveniences of Rash Mariages. bitterest worldly Sorow, soone endes, eyther by Benefit of Fortune , or violence of death:    [  The vncertaintie of worldly thinges. ] neither is the firmest worldly pleasure, yt of more continuance, then an Imagynation, whiche is straight crost with a contrary Suggestion. What difference was there betwene the Fortunes of Cesar and Pompey ,   [ Both POMPEY and CESAR, died violently ] when their endes were both violent? saue that I hould Cesars to be the harder: for that, he was murthered in the Armes of Prosperytie, and Pompey , at the feete of Disgrace: but being both dead, vnto their Monumentes, Writers adde this Opinion. Cesar, in his lyfe, was more fortunate then Pompey: and Pompey, more honest then Cesar. A proofe, that some Disgrace, is the ground of Good Reporte : and some good Fortune, the Trumpe of Infamie : therfore, let no man yeld to Aduersitie, nor affie too much in Pompe and painted Prosperytie: for the one, is but vexation, the other vanitie, and both in short time vanish. A sodayne alteration (as me thought) made me to contemplate of these causes: for that (commynge out of my lodgyng, somwhat tymely) I entred the great Chamber, with as strange a regarde, as he yt cometh out of a House full of Torch and Taperlights, into a darke and obscure Corner: knowing that at midnight (aboute whiche tyme, I forsooke my company) I lefte the place, attyred lyke a seconde Paradice: the earthly Goddesses, in brightnesse, resembled Heauenly Creatures, whose Beauties dassled mennes eyes more then the Beames of the Sunne: The sweet Musick recorded the Harmonie of Angels, the straunge and curious deuices in Maskers, seemed as fygures of deuine Misteries. And to be short, the place was a verie Sympathie , of an imagined Paradice. And in the space of one slumbering sleepe, to bee left lyke a desert wildernesse, without any creature, saue sundrie sauadge Beastes, portrayed in the Tapestrie hanginges, imprest suche a heauy passion in my minde, as for the time, I fared as one, whose sences had forgot how to doo their bounden offices: In the ende, to recomfort my throbbing hart, I tooke my Citterne, and to a solempne Note, sung this following Sonet, which I a litle before, composed vpon a quiet thought, I possessed after my reading of Boetrus of the consolation of Philosophy, translated into Italion, by Cosimo Bartoli . Faire is thy show, but foule thou mak'st the soule: Farewell, prowde Mynde, in thousand Fancies twirld: Thy pompe,   [  SISIPHVS. ] is lyke the Stone, that still doth rowle. Â¶ Farewell, sweete Loue, thou wish of worldly ioy, Thy wanton Cuppes, are spiste with mortal sin: Farewell, dyre Hate, thou doost thy selfe annoy, Therefore my hart, no place to harbour in. Â¶ Enuy, farewel, to all the world a foe, Lyke DENNIS BVLL, a torture to thy selfe: Disdayne, farewell, though hye thy thoughts doe flow, Death comes, and throwes, thy Sterne vpon a shelfe. Flatterie, farewell, thy Fortune dooth not last. Thy smoothest tales, concludeth with thy shame: Suspect, farewell, thy thoughts, thy intrayles wast, And fear'st to wounde, the wight thou faine would'st blame Sclaunder, farewell, which pryest with LYNX his eyes, And canst not see, thy spots, when all are done: Care, Care, farewell, which lyke the Cockatrice: Doest make the Graue, that al men faine would shun. Â¶ And farewell world, since naught in thee I finde But vanytie, my soule in Hell to drowne: And welcombe Phylosophy, who the mynde Doest with content, and heauenly knowledge crowne. During the time, that my thoughtes swounded with the charme of my passionate Musick. The Sun decked in his most gorgious Raies, gaue a bon Giorno, to the whole troupe: and so many as were, within the sownde of my Instrument, were drawne, with no lesse vertue, then the Steele vnto the Addamant. In so much, of the suddaine, to beholde the statelynesse of the presence, I was dryuen foorth of my muse, with a starklyng admyration, not vnlyke vnto him, that sleeping ouer a dying brand, is hastelye wakened with the lyghtenynge of a thousande sparcles. The offices of Curtesie discharged on euery part, Segnior Soranso sayed: the Poets fayned not without reason, that Amphions Harp gaue sence vnto stone Walles .   [  A commendation of Musick. ] For so deuine (quoth hee) are the operations, and vertues of Musick. As he that shall be bounde, to declare her particuler Graces, shall be no lesse troubled then the Paynter Zeuxes was in the counterfettinge of Cupid : Who after much trauell, was driuen to draw him blynde, for otherwise, he had vnder taken Sisiphus taske, because the twinckling reflections of Cupids eies, threw a thousande Beauties vpon his face,   [  A fayning how CVPID came to be called blinde. ] and shadowed the worke of the Paynter. Thus through Ignoraunce, Cupid hath euer since bin reputed blinde, and for his owne perfection, is honoured with ye title of the God of Loue . The name of Loue gaue a large occasion of discourse: but for that an other tyme was appoynted for those disputations, and the morninge was wholly dedicated, vnto the seruice of God: the question drowned in Soransos snggestion, and the whole company scylent, in such affayres, attended Queene Aurelias comming: who, in chaunge of gorgious, and rich apparrell, kept her accustomed howre, to go vnto the Chappel. By that time seruice was ended, and euery mans deuotion donne, dinner was ready to be set vppon the Tables, with such choyce of delicate Uiandes, as vnto the bountie of the Feast, there might nothing be added. After that Queene Aurelia and the rest, had taken their ordinarye places, euery one helped the disgestion of their meate, either in inuenting some ciuill merriment, or in hearinge it reported by an other. Bergetto all this while, was neither heard to speake, nor seene to smyle. Which, perceiued by Franceschina Sancta his Mistres, she (moued with the spirit of compassion) studied, howe with Iustice, shee might reuoke her sentence, and vnstring her seruauntes tongue: and to that ende, shee demaunded, how three good turnes,   [  A question to trye a quicke witt. ] might be vnrewarded, three offences pardoned, three iniuryes leaft vnreuenged, and in euerye of these, Iustice preserued? This question passed through the table: and retourned without his true resolution. In the end (quoth Segnior Philoxenus) Monsier Bergetto , what is your opinion? Sir [[quoth] Bergetto ) my Mistresse hath locked the tongue, that should pronounce it. Why (quoth Franceschina ) these be no questions of loue, and therefore you haue libertie to speake. No Lady (quoth Bergetto ) but his vertue may appeare in the aunsweare. Well (quoth his Mystresse) if you canne cleare your trespasse, by one of these questions, I must do no iniurie to Iustice, and therefore, saye your pleasure. Uppon this warrant (quoth Bergetto ) to your first three, I aunsweare. A Captayne maye betray his charge, which is a benefit to the enemy: but the betrayer,   [  Three good turns, may be receiued, vnrewarded. ] is not to be receiued as a friende: for he that will sell his countryman, may not be held assured, to a straunger. Secondly, a Theefe that peacheth his fellowes, doeth good to the Common wealth: & yet, deserueth no reward: for he that may preuileadg his own theft, in bewraying other mens, will euermore steale vpon presumptio. Thirdly, to win a mans money, is a good turne, & yet the loser is not to be recompenced: for his intent, was to winne the winners.   [  Three offences, may with Iustice be pardoned. ] To your second three questions, a man maye offende through ignoraunce, which is excused without a pardon: for ignoraunce, is without intent of euill: therfore to be suffered, though not to be cherished: A man may offend, through necessitie, which commendeth Iustice, with the vertue to forgiue: for necessity, is bound vnto no law, and therefore, deserueth not to be punnished with the rigour of law: To the third, a man may offend through rashnes, & make amends wt repentace: which Iustice may pardo, wtout preiudice to equity: & herein (faire Mistres) I haue showen my trespas, & the reparation of my trespasse. To your third three questios,   [  Three iniuries, may pass vnreuenged. ] a man may hurt his friend against his will, which is an iniurie: yet, ought not to be reuenged: for reuenge, can but afflict ye trespasser, and the misfortune, greeueth him: Before the husband, a man may kisse the wife, by mistaking: which is an iniury, not to be reuenged: for the wife may wipe away the wrong wt her hand, & the husband by reuege, may make worke for the Chirurgion: And to ye last, a man must be content to take good wordes of a beggerly debtor: which is an iniury not to be reuenged: for a man can haue of a Cat but her skin, & of a begger, but his scrip: vnles he wil sel ye Appothecary the greace of ye one, & the dice maker, ye bones of the other. The whole company gaue a verdict, yt Bergetto , had expouded his Mistres doubts wtout blemish to Iustice: and therfore were ernest sufers for his remission. Whom she pardoned, with this promise, that he should behaue himselfe honourably towardes women hereafter. For his lybertie, Bargetto reuerently kissed his Mistresses hande, and thus all vnkindnesse pacified. Queene Aurelia mouyng alitle, raisde the companye, from the Table, who a pretty tyme after dinner, had respyt, to prepare their wits, for the accustomed exercise. The Clocke had no sooner sounded the disputation howre: But Queene Aurelia , and her Ladies were redy in the drawinge Chamber, and vpon warnyng, the chosen Gentilmen gaue their attendaunce: who hauyng taken their places. The Eunuck (knowing his charge) vnto the Lute sung this Sonet, The Vowes and Rites, of an vnfayned hart: Who with my plaintes, doe pearce the subtil Ayre. That Beautie thou, maist heare and see my smart. Who sues, but that thy Deputie on earthe, May take in gree, my off'ringes of good wyll, And in accompt returne my Loue in worth. With charge thy priestes, my bones to Ashes burne: And with the same, thy Aulters all to meale, That I may make [to serue, eche Louers turne] The peace off'ring, with Sacrifice of zeale. This Sonet in Beauties behalfe, put the whole companie in remembraunce of Doctor Mossenigoes last nights lavish speach of Beauty , and the scandalous comparyng of her to Poyson , or, which is worse, a more subtil infection: And therefore, to bee resolued of his wronge, or her gyltines, Queene Aurelia , appointed Monsier Bargetto to be her Champion, and to assist him, (for it was agreed that free choice of Mariage , shoulde (this daye) bee disputed: whose affection for the most proceedeth from the vertue of Beautie ,) she lycensed euery one that fauoured her cause: which done, she willed ye Doctor and his fauourers to spit their venym. Maddame ([quoth] the Doctor,)   [  Olde men are bound by their grauitie, to say no more then they vvill stand to. ] it neither beseemeth the stayednes of my yeares, nor agreeth with the grauetie of my profession, in such an assembly, to speake the thing I dare not auouch, & therefore since it cometh to this issue, that I must, hazard vpon a charge, or shrinke away with shame: though my ennemyes be many, my cause is iuste: vppon which warrant I am feareles of my foes, and resolute in myne opinion. Bergetto likewise glad of this fauour, protested before Queene Aurelia and the whole company, that in the faithfull execution of his charge, the prodygall spoyle of hys lyfe, should giue contempt to death. The Doctor,   [  The dashe of a Pen, is more greeuous then the counterbuse of a Launce. ] that had giuen as many deepe woundes with his Pen, as euer he had doone with his Launce, shronke no more at these threates, then an Oke at the Helue of an Axe, but coldely wylled him, to vse his pleasure, he was ready to defend (or to die, in) his oppinion. Wherevpon Bergetto , to strengthen himself the better, made this remembraunce, of the yesterdayes reporte. It is ([quoth] he) already approoued, if the married in forced Mariages, could as well finish with the Church,   [  Free choise in Mariage defended. ] as they can account with their consciences: their ioy to be Married was not so colde, as their desire to be deuorsed would be whot: therfore by this awkeward successe in forcement: a free choise in Mariage, can not choose, but continue (as I thinke) as much loue betweene the Married, as the other sowed debate. Rashnes and constraint ([quoth] the Doctor) are bothe violents   [ Reproofe, &c. ] and euery violent is a vice, then how can a vicious attempt haue a vertuous successe:   [  Defence, &c. ] Men doo euill ([quoth] Bergetto ) that good may come of it, and it is allowed. And men doo good ([quoth] the Doctor) that euill may come   [  Reproofe, &c. ] of it, and it is forbidden: for it is the intent bothe in good and euill, that commendeth or condemneth: and what good intent hath the foolishe young man, that by his rashnes in Marriage, robbeth his parentes of their comfort, and him selfe of his credit. He satisfieth his fancie ([quoth] Bergetto ) a speciall regarde in Marriage: and where there is a sweete accorde betweene the married, the parents cannot but reioice, and the neighbours are bound to speake well: and beautie in his wiues face, will feede his heart with a thousand delights: so that he shall sustaine want with little greefe and labour to get wealth with a great desire: for where vnitie is, small things groweth to great. Such may be the vnitie (quoth the Doctor) as small   [  Reproofe, &c. ] greefes may growe to great sorrowes: when the winde is in the neck of a stooping Tree, it falleth downe right: and when the vnthriftines of the Husband, agreeeth with the euill huswiferie of the Wife, Sorrow striueth to be in the married mans bosome, before the maried be in his wiues bead: and what other expectation may there be, either of the one or the other, when he satisfyeth his fancie, before he considereth of the dutyes of Mariage: and she in taking an husband, that is ignoraunt in the affaires of husbandry, and in offices of Mariage:   [  Duties before Mariage. ] It is the office of the married, to be aduised ere he loue, and louing to be reposed in his choise: It is the office of the married to prouide for an Household, before he take possession of his hearts delight: and it is the office of the marryed, to examine the conditions of his Mistresse, before he enter into any couenaunt of Mariage. And how can he be aduised, that marrieth without the priuitie of his Parents? and how can he supporte an household, that marryeth with his Parents displeasure, vpon whose deuotion he liueth? and how can he iudge of his Mistresse conditions, that wanteth discretion to consider of his owne estate? And where you alledge, the beautie of his wiues face, wyll feede the husband with delight: his delight will starue his body, without other supplyes: so that when charge shall increase, and his wealth diminish, let the foolish younge marryed man, impose him self vpon this fortune, that he cannot so oft kisse the sweete lippes of his beautifull wife, as he shalbe driuen to fetche bitter sighes, from his sorrowfull hart. Sir (quoth Soranso , taking Bergettos parte:   [  Defence, &c. ] ) of two euils the least is to be chosen: and it is lesse euill for a man, to lyue a while hardly, and satisfye his owne fancie, then to liue euer discontented and please his freendes. The good behauiour of the maryed, may winne the Parents to consent, and amend their exhibition: or death may come, and put them in possession of theyr Parentes lyuing. If either of these chaunce, as one is shortely like to happen, the penaunce that they indured, wyll season theyr prosperitie, and counsell the Married to keepe within their teacher, to leape within their latchet, and lyue within theyr compasse: The louing aduise of the husband, wyll reforme the disposition of euill in the wife. For (as Plato sayeth,) there is no woman so perfect good,   [  No man nor woma, but in some point deserue to be blamed, and in some other to be praised. ] but in some one point may be reprehended: nor no man so faultlesse, but that somewhat in him may be amended: so that if the Husband gently reprehend the fault of his Wife, and the Wife patiently suffer the offence of her Husband, the abylytie of theire estate wyll sustaine a househould, and their looue and agreement wilbe an especiall comfort vnto them selues, and a commendable example vnto all the neighbours. The best of bothe your euils (quoth Doctor Mossenigo ) is starke naught: but our question was not,   [  Reproofe, &c. ] to chuse the least of euyls, but that which is simply good: notwithstanding, to aunswer to the sequell of this rashenesse in Mariage, you saye, theyr good behauiours may recouer theyr Parents good wyll, but I Prophesie, that theyr euill demeanures, are more likely to extinguish the affection of a Father: for necessitie wyll accustome the Husband with dishonest shyftes, and keepes his fayre Wife from beeing ydle: for want muste be supplyed, what shame so euer ensue. Then is it lykely, that the Parentes which did shutte their Pursses in the beginning, to punishe the contempt of their Chyldren, wyll now fast locke them, to be reuenged of theyr infamie. And where you gaue them a hope, by their parentes death, I say no man dyneth worse, then hoping Tantalus , nor none are more wetshod,   [  Their pennaunce is great that liue in incertaine hope. ] then they which expect deade mens shooes, and when they fall, the soules (perhaps) wilbe worne: I meane the Father in his life tyme, may take order to dye euen with the worlde, or at leaste, leaue his liuing maimed, and the most of his substaunce wasted: for in a tempest at Sea, what Pylote hath any care of goodes, that seeeth the ship, at the poynte to syncke: euen so what parents can haue any ioye of worldly wealth (more   [ An vngodly childe maketh an vnthriftie Father. ] then to defende necessytye) when he seeth, the heyre bothe of his labour, and lyuing, out of hope of weldooing: so that through this rashnesse many sonnes, during their fathers lyues, with hard shiftes, shift of necessity, and after their deathes liue disinherited: and not altogether so much for their owne contempt, as for their wiues incontinencye: & truely in the fyrst,   [  The seueral paines of offences. ] although the parentes may be thought cruell, yet are they not to be reputed vnnaturall, for that euery offence hath his proper scourge: restitution is the true payne for robbery: an eye is reuenge for an eye, a hand for a hande, death challengeth death, and disobedience in the sonne, deserueth disinheritaunce, by the father. Touching the dishonesty of the daughter in lawe (as it is great hazarde but that necessitie, thus bestowed, will bend her a little:   [  Incontinency slaundereth an honest mans house. ] ) the seueritie is sufferable, if her husbandes father shut her forth of his doores, for that the honour of a mans house is so delicate, as it can awaie with no staine: and (reseruyng your fauours vertuous dames) where a strumpet entereth, she stuffeth the house with slaunder, as carraine infecteth the ayre with stincke, yea the occasion is iust: if the father spare to gette, and the mother cease to saue, nay if they spend that which they haue, for it weare great pitty, that there should be any thing leafte either of their liuyng or labour, to support a harlots pride. O how innumerable are the inconueniences, of this timeritye in Marriage? The wise by coniecture and daylye experience seeeth, and the foolish (with sorrowe in theyr own entrailes) feeleth: and therfore as a hainous offence: the auncient Philosophers (which without partiallitie, checked Vice and cherrished Vertue ) punished this contempt of Children. Plutarke saythe,   [  Paynes for timerity in Marriage. ] the sonne that marryeth without his Parents consent, among the Greekes was publikely whipped: among the Lacedemonians dishearited, and among the Theabanes bothe disinhearited, and of his Parents openly accursed. The yonger company, began to feare a restraint of Freeloues libertie, and their Goddesse Beauties disgrace: The Doctor gaue Capitaine Bergetto such crosse blowes, who though he fainted in his opinion, yet (like a Cocke, that hath one of his eyes stricken out, and his head bared to the braines, yet striketh vntill he dyeth) he assayled the Doctor with this one more reason. Maister Doctor ([quoth] he) they go farre that neuer returne,   [  Defence, &c. ] and the battaile is very cruell where none escapes: what although a number speede yll in making of their owne choyce, many haue prospered well. In matches of the best foresight, good Fortune hath not alwayes beene sound, and yet foresight is not to be blamed, nor the other aduenture to be dispitefully condemned. Ouid sayeth, that Forma numen habet , then by vertue of her Diuinitie, it is like she will sustaine them in aduersity, that in prosperity became her vowed Seruaunts: neither dooth this stayne of the wiues behauiour often follow, for where Beautie, Loue ,  & Free choise , maketh the Mariage, they may be crossed by Fortune , and yet continue faithfull. Piramus and Thisbie, Romeus and Iuliet, Arnalt and Amicla , and diuers others at the point to possesse their loues, were dispossest of their liues, but yet vnstained with dishonesty. This want with which you threaten them, what is it in respect of the pleasures these Louers possesse?   [  A discriptio of wealth abused. ] Wealth which is the contrarie, what is it, beeing ill vsed? a beautie in the Chest, a bondage to the minde, and a blot in the soule: but a couple vnited by this affection, for a little Fleabiting of worldly pennury,   [  The ioye of true loue. ] suck Nectar betweene their lippes, Cram Manna into theyr Bowels, and possesse Heauen in their hearts. How farre Maister Doctor argueth from the opinion of auncient Philosophers, and famous Schoolemen, these authorities witnesseth: Ouid, Nigidius, Samocratius, Petrarke , and others in their life time, addored Beautie , with their bookes honoured her, and by their deathes eternized her glorye. But for that her vertues be Diuine, and Maister Doctor is soyled with slaunder, blasphemy and mallice, he is vnworthy to be perfected, with one thought of her excellencie, which ignorance maketh him so obstinate. The yonger company began to take heart, in hearing of this Tale, so that the Gentlewomen strengthened Bergetto with good countenaunces, for (for modesties sake) they were silent, and the Gentlemen succoured him with theyr best reasons. But all this hope prooued but a lyghtning ioye: for Doctor Mossenigo , dubble inraged, partly for the check he receyued, partly for the countenaunce the company gaue his aduersarie: but cheefely for to behold a new Dye, set vpon a stayned matter, so sharpely refuted Bergetto , as he had no delyght to reply, nor his supporter desire to succor him. (Quod he) Ouid dreamed of a diuinity in Beautie , but neuer tasted other then a sweete venim, to proceede from her: He loued Iulia, Augustus Daughter, and enioyed her: but with what fortune? marry, he was stript of his liuing, and spoyled of his libertie,   [  Sundry famous Philosophers and Poets punished for their loues. ] for her sake. Nigidius , an auncient Romaine , and in great fauour with the people, for this folly, tasted of Ouids fortune, which was, to dye in exile. Samocratius was in youthe, so prodigall of his Loue, as in age hated of his freendes, he dyed in Prison, with famine. And as for frantick Petrarke , I feare me Madonna Laura smyled more often in reading of his follyes, then he himselfe did, with the sweete recompences of his fancies. All these were men learned, wise, and in their other actions (for their grauitie) were admyred, and onely for their lightnesse in loue, liue to this day defamed: For your other authorities, your owne remembraunce of theyr deathes, shew a vengeaunce sufficient, for the contempt of the Childre. But where you say Beautie, Loue , and Free choyse , lade the Maried with such pleasures, that they endure pouertie, as a Fleabiting. In deede, want wyll so quicken them, as the Husband wyll leape at a Cruste, and the Wife trot for her Dinner. But suppose the best, thus married (whose loues are indifferent) with patience doo indure the afflictions of Fortune : theyr agreement is no generall warrant.   [  Cause of rashe Mariages. ] The greater number of these Mariages, are not solempnyzed, through equaltye of loue, but through inequaltye of lyuyng. The coueitous Marchaunt, with no more delight heereth the passing bell of his ritch neyghbour, which promyseth hym the first loppe of his sonnes liuyng, then the poore gentleman eyeth the able heyre, with desyre to match him (perhappes) with his fayre proude Daughter. Then as pleasaunt baytes baineth Fyshe, as counterfet Calles beguileth Foules, and as Crocadyles teares, intrappeth Fooles: to lyke destruction, lures are throwne to lime this gallant: freendly vsage shall intyce hym, good wordes shall welcome hym, curtesy shall cheere hym, Beauty shall bewitch hym, and fayre promises, shall altogeather beguile hym. Newe Uessels are apt for any licquor, and young heades (empty of experyence) are seduced, with easey subtiltyes, to be shorte, he shalbe betrothed by cunning:   [  An vnfortunate Mariage. ] hys promyse once past (for that in delaye, is daunger) the Mariage must be in poste haste, and the mislikyng at leasure: but in most of these matches, the sorrowe begynneth, before the solemnitye of the Marriage endeth. The father hearyng of the indiscression of his sonne, galleth his harte with greefe: the mother, spoyleth her eyes wyth teares, and the freend occupyeth his tounge, in bemoning of hys kynsemans follye. There is yet a further sorrowe, bytter to the father and vnbenefyciall to the sonne. The father that thought to bestowe hys daughter wyth the Marryage money of hys sonne, is forced to diminishe his inheritaunce, for her aduauncement. And by this meanes, the ioye which begunne in the beautie of his Wife, is like to end in the beggery of himselfe: and since these vnsauerie effectes, growe from the vertue of Beauties Diuinitie, let Mounsier Bergetto burne in his Heresie. But Doctor Mossenigo will holde himselfe happie, neuer to be warmed by her fyre. Bergetto had not a worde more to saye,   [  A Gentleman in his reuenge ought not to offend a ciuill company. ] but angerly looked vpon his Sworde, with a countenaunce that promised vengeance vpon the Doctors blasphemous tongue, had he not beene stayed with a reuerent consideration of the company. In the end, because Maister Doctor should not be too proude of his conquest, nor Bergetto ouermuch appalled with his defeate, [quoth] Signior Fabritio , Iudge of the controuersies: in a single controuersie the argument of the one, is to be allowed as truthe, and the cauiling of the other, to be reiected as error: but for that this hath beene a double contention, as in defence and reproofe, bothe of Beautie and Free choise of Mariage, Madona Isabella , and I, pronounce sentence with Bergetto , in the behalfe of Beautie , for Beautie is a blessing, and if she worke euill effectes in some, their naughtie disposition, and not Beautie is to be blamed: and with Doctor Mossenigo we likewise giue iudgement in reproofe of rashenesse in Mariage. This iudgement pleased Queene Aurelia and the whole company, who were glad that they were thus forewarned of the inconueniences of Free choise in Loue , which they a little fauoured, but yet were more glad of the Triumphe of Beautie , whom they all affectedly honoured: and therefore quoth Queene Aurelia , good Wine neede no Iuie Bushe,   [  Vertue commendeth her selfe. ] fyne Marchaundise are solde without a Signe, and Beautie is sufficiently commended by her owne excellencie, and therefore we wyll spare Bergettos ready seruice, vntill oportunitie, present further imployment. But for yt your Tryumphe shall haue his full right, we licence you to tel some one Historie to confirme your reason The Doctor glad of this lybertie, who (althoughe he had receyued no Disgrace, yet he repined that he had not the whole honour of the Disputation, determyned in his Historie, a litle more to nettle the fauourers of Beautie: with which intent, vpon Queene Aurelias commaundemente, he reported as followeth. Besides Capo Verdo , in times past, the capitall Citie, within the kingdome of Naples , sometime dwelled a forward young Gentleman called Marco Malipiero : the sonne and heire of Caualiero Antonio Malipiero , in his youthe renowned, for manie valiant seruices. This young Gentleman in the pride of his youth, Gentlewoman named Felice , the Daughter of Philippo Prouolo , an auncient Gentleman, by harde aduenture decayed. But yet in dispight of fortunes iniurie, who disabled him with many losses, and thereby, of small wealth to aduance his Daughter: Felice her selfe was inriched with suche perfections of of nature, that the friends lamented, but could not blame the affection of young Malipiero : which in verie deede, grewe so great, as it contemned the duetie of a childe, and scorned the aduise of a Father: Felice alone gouerned him, and none but Felice he obeyed. Prouolo intertayned Malipiero , with the curtisie of a friende, as the good partes he possessed:   [  The poore eketh to matche with wealthy. ] as for the possibilitie of liuing he stoode in, who (striking the yron while it was whote) secreatelie fianced Malipiero to his fayre Daughter. The old Knight stormed at these newes, and notwithstanding this knowne contract, if by any perswasions he could haue reuoked his sonnes consent, he would haue caused the Pope to haue dispensed with his conscience: and to that effect, hee caused sundry of his friendes to deale with him in these affayres. And among many an auncient Gentleman, his Gouernour, and somtimes his Schoolemaister (whose grauetie, Malipiero reuerensed) in a mylde order commoned with him, and amonge other questions demaunded, with what reason he could iustifye his light affections; and condemne the sounde aduyce of friendes. Malipiero,   [  A rash aunswer. ] resolute in his loue, boldly aunswered, that Felices deuine beauty, was a sufficient warrant for ether. This wise Gouernour would not harden his hart with obstinacy,   [  The wordes sheweth the wit of the eeporter, but his gesture causeth attention in the hearer. ] in a sharp reprehension of his publike arrogant aunswere, but with an affable countenaunce, coniured hym to lysten vnto his graue sayinges. O (quoth he) is she beautifull? then you haue worke inough to watch her, & mischance sufficient to suspect her. Is she beautifull? then her rashnesse in consent, showeth that she is indiscreet: so that the diuersitie of quallities will soone finde out a diuision in your desires. Is she beautifull? than it is lyke (by her quick agreement) that she is poore, then is her Loue fastened on your riches: so that when you lacke money to maintaine her pompe, she leaues, to make much of your person. Is she beautifull? then she is withall (lightly) proude, and the pride of a woman (saith Periander ) is lyke vnto a   [  The nature of Pride. ] Dropsey: for a drinke encreaseth the drouth of the one, so (sayeth he) Cost enlargeth the expence of the other: then if your Purse be not open to feede her folly, she will pawne her honour to please her fancy. Is she beautifull? then her indiscreation, in this hastinesse, showes her but a slender huswife, so that the charge of your house, shall eate and consume your gaines abroade. Is she beautiful? then your dispence, must be in her disposition, or els her lookes will litle repose you: if she order your goodes, her expences will be great, and her gettynges small, your house shall be stored with costlye stuff, & your seruants starued with lack of meate: she will goe like a Pecock, & you like a meacock: what followeth? in her brauery, she must be seene: if she take the lyberty to walk, shee giueth other occasion to speake, & your selfe to sigh. A faire picture set in the Market place, moueth many to gase: if the counterfet giueth contentment, the creature must needes delight: and if any view your wife with vnlawfull affection, his practises wil be many to win his desyre. Take heede, you vndertake an intisinge course, which without good order, will make you breathlesse before the midst of your race: you enter into great charge, see meanes to support it. Your Father liues, and must maintaine his accustomed reputatio: if he spare to sustaine you, it is much: to defraye the charge, of your Wife and housholde, he cannot: therefore so loue, that this dispence may be shared betweene you, and your wiues Parents: and as far foorth as I can see, Felices Father hath much adoe, to keepe rayne out of his house top: then if with difficultie he lieth drye in his Bed, it is impossible he should haue anye great cheare at his Boorde: what reckonyng can you make, to be supported by him that hath it not? and howe can you dare presume, to bee supplyed by your owne Father? when the timeritie of your marriadge displeaseth him to death. Looke into these mischeeues, before you feele the miseries they presage: looke before you leape, leaste you be wet, before you be a ware: your friendes hath a comfort, but you the benefite of weldooing. The Schoolemaister gaue Malipiero this aduice, with such a temperate gesture: that (although good counsell preuailed not, yet) he reuerently told him,   [ Loue enioyneth vs to do what we kno is amis. ] that his experience knew more, then his greene imagination could containe: and therefore, he woulde meditate of his louing admonition, and proceede no further without his priuitie. But ah, these weare but sweete wordes to betraye himselfe, and to blinde his friende. For vppon the first oportunytie Malipiero speeds vnto PHILIPPO PROVOLO , and recountes the importunyties of hys Freendes, with a desire to haue the Mariage preuilie solemnised, since that he could not obtaine the open consent of his parentes. Prouolo , fearing the daunger of delay, was as ready to satisfy, as Malipiero was earnest to request: insomuch as early in a morning, Marco Malipiero , was set in possession of his hearts delight:   [  An early mariage, worketh a late repentaunce. ] and before night, was dispossessed of his whole bodies welfare: For his sorrowful Father, and heauy friends, hearing of this suddaine Mariage , after they had a while bemoned, the rashnes of Maliperio , with the Affection of Parentes, menaced to punish his ouersight (in not regarding him) as Stragers. Prouolo , on the other side, to geue knowledge to his Sonne in Lawes frendes, him, she had not wholly consumed him: set out his abylytie to the most Aduauntage: much like vnto a Market Marchant, that on a Newyears Day mornyng, exposeth his painted tokens, to the ritchest show: His Sonne (in lawe) was accomodated with the Attyre and furnyture of a Gentleman, and his Wife was set foorth, with the showe, of rich Malipieroes Heires Espouse, and not as poore Prouoloes Daughter:   [  The commo sorte Iudge as they affect. ] Insomuch, as the common sorte, blinded with showes, iudged after their eyes affection, and reputed old Malipiero a cruel couetous Churle, for dealing with Prouolo so frowardly, that had intreated his Son so honorably. But these murmurings, litle moued the good auncient Knight: for well he wist, this brauerie was but a blase, as soone ended as the flame of a drie Faggot. And which should auenge him, this pride promised a change, attyred with as much pennurie as the other with pompe. The following effect, confirmed olde Malipieros opinion: for Prouolo spent so largely at the beginning, in hope with this florishe, to make accorde betweene the Sonne and the Father: As nowe his Table was furnished with emptie Platters, and his Audit Bagges with a set of Counters.   [  The miserye of want. ] So that want , that will make a toothlesse woman to bite at Brasen Walles, entred into Prouolos House, and swore both him and his whole householde vnto the statutes of necessitie: whose lawes were so straite, that although they all had great occasion of sorowe, they had no leasure for shifting to supplie their wantes: In so much as in shorte time, there was no neighbour, that Prouolo was not in his debt or daunger, and no good natured youth there aboutes, that Marco Malipiero had not boorded or coosoned. And what shoulde faire Felice doe in this extremitie? liue vpon her husbandes trauel, and be idle her selfe? that were no good Huswiferie: and yet poore Malipiero loued her so dearely, that hee woulde haue ventured vppon a thousande infamies, to maintayne her in the state of an honest Gentlewoman: but although his shiftes helped, they defrayed not her desire to be braue. A Diamond hath not his grace but in golde, nor a fayre Woman, her full commendation but in the ornamentes of brauerie.   [  Brauerye belongeth to Beautie. ] So that attyred to her best aduantage, faire Felice would manie times walke, vnto the Piatso Richio ,   [  PIATSO, a market place, or a place of assembly. ] a place where the brauest Gentlemen assembled, & where the fynest deuices were sould: she taking this liberty to walke, bound the gallant yong Gentlemen, in curtesie to Court her: curtuous seruice, is to be accepted with thankes: acceptance of seruice, inlargeth acquaintance: acquaintance ingendreth familiarytie: and famyliaritie, setteth al Folies abroath: So that, let other Married men take warnyng,   [  A necessarye note. ] by Malipieroes hard fortune: for, if their wyues loue gadding, lyke faire Felice , & be inconstant, do want, or finde in their Husbands, miscontentment: Twentie to one, they wil pawn their honours, to please their fancies. Well, Felice lost nothyng by these Iorneyes: for some one Gallant, would present her with a Ventoie , to coole her selfe: some other, with a Mirrour, to behould her selfe:   [  Courtesy don with an euill intent. ] and some, with Lawnes, Ruffes, Coyfes , and suche necessaries, to set out her selfe: & yet vpon no dishonorable condition, but (by your leaue) wyth hope of an after fauour. This trafique, faire Felice vsed, vntill (amonge a number, that temperately affected her,) Marino Giorgio , the rich Orphant of Capo Verdo immoderately loued her, and withall; the honors of courtisie serued her: But notwithstanding, his lusty personage, might please: his louely countenaunce, might intyce: and his rare wit, passing through a swete tongue, might bewitch a woman in loue: for that Malipiero , was inritched with these perfections: Felice ,   [  Disdaine haunteth desire. ] regarded Marino Georgio , but with an ordinary grace: and had it not ben for that Archinchaunter, Golde (perhappes) would neuer haue bene inconstant. This light account of Felice ,   [  The fyre of Loue. ] inlarged the affection of Marino : for as drincke increaseth the dropsies drowth, so disdaine, heapeth coales vppon desire: whereof Marino , (Teste se ipso) hath least an infallible aucthoritie: whose torments were so greeuous, as the fire: which of al flames, burneth most, and appeareth least, burst out of his mouth, the smoake of such furious sighes, that where he was but late, of a pure Sanguine Complection, hee seemed nowe, nothyng, but Choller adust: So that, his friendes mourned, and many moned his strange alteration: who counsayled him to take the Physitions aduice: But neither Galen, Hipocrates , nor their Enemie, Paracelsus , could skyl of his cure: so that he was in daunger to haue consumed to Cinders, had not Macrello , the Physition of Loue, vndertaken his helth, who comforted him with many sweete wordes of hope:   [  Phisicke cureth not loue. ] but, Marino, continually afflicted himselfe in recounting an impossibilytie of fauour. Why (quoth Macrello ) is not your parsonage seemely? Yes: but it doth not please. Is not your face louely? Yes: but it doth not allure. Is not your wyt quicke and good? Yes: but it can not perswade. Is not Felice , a woman? Yes: and more, an Angell. Well, then (quoth Macrello ,) be of good comfort, Angelles be not cruell, nor steelie harted. O (quoth Marino ,) but Felice , is constant, and true to her husband, who to continue her affection, is graced with these and many more perfections. Yea (quoth Macrello ) but hee wanteth one of your cheefest beauties. What one is that (quoth Marino ?) Euen that, that opened the double locked dores of Acrisius brasen Tower,   [  The fence of Goulde, ] and put Iubiter in possession of his daughter Danais loue. And thinke you this Goulden Beautie, will not make a passage into poore Malipieros Bed Camber? I warrant you yeas: you haue Goulde more at commaundement then I, but I know the vertue better then you. This short tale quickned dying Marrino , as the slashe of Rose water dooth a sullen swounding Childe. Wherupon (quoth he) Macrello , if your Medicine be of no lesse vertue to restore my lyfe, then your wordes to geue me hope: the fortune, shall be your profit, as wel as my pleasure. Well (quoth Macrello ) sustaine your selfe with hope,   [  Hope comforteth but Loue cureth the Louer. ] and for that your inuention is delicate, deuise you some curious rich Iuell, and let mee alone (quoth hee) bothe to charme and to present it: and so with a remembraunce in the hande, he left Marino , to contemplate of his loue, and to consider how to recouer his lyfe: who in the ende, concluded to sende faire Felice , the Image of himselfe in Goulde, inameled blacke, his face meager and pale, and by a deuice, the blacke mantell throwne aside, for to appeare, the bared Carkasse of Death,   [  Marinos Present to his Mistrisse. ] with the intrayles consumed, and in the seate of his lyfe, to place Felice , attyred with Diamonds, Rubyes, Emrodes, and other precious Stones, looking vppon his smoking harte, whervppon, was written these two breefes. Loue onely giues mee health, Not Medicine nor wealth. This Image made vnto his fancye, he wrote this following Letter. what I do possesse, I acknowledge to be yours, and my selfe to be, but your steward. And for this seruice, because it is duty, I craue nothing, but leaue my merrit wholly to your consideration. Yet, least my scylence, shuld rob the glory of your pitty, and my death, reaue you of a faythfull Seruaunt: more of zeale, to do you long seruice: then of any desyre I haue to liue. I heare present you my consumed selfe, only kept aliue, by the lyfe of fayre Felice, who sitteth crowned, in the Pallace of my heart: whych bleeding at her feete, showeth the meanes of my cure: which if you witsafe, I liue: if not, you see my death. And thus, doubtfull betweene both, vntill I kisse your sweete aunsweare, I remayne. Vnto my latter Gaspe, Your faythfull MARINO GEORGIO. This letter Sealed, and Subscribed, To the hands of the most faire Felice: Macrello was sent for: to whom Marino deliuered, both the Iuell, and the letter, with out instructions to do his message: for Protheus could not chainge himselfe into moe shapes then Macrello : as well, to auoide suspition, as to compasse his purpose: who behaued himselfe so cunningly, in Marinoes errande, as (to be shorte, vertuous Dames) after many perswasions, Felice returned him with this Answere. that your passions are so extreame, I kepe your Picture in my Bosome: But, with what thought, I blush to write, though Pitie be my warrant: so that I leaue the euent of our Loue, to your Consideration: and my yealding, to Macrelloes Reporte: who, in bewraying your passions, lette fall more teares, then I could drie vp with a thousand sighes: So that ouercom with rueth, to see your Affection so great, and your passion so daungerous, I can not but commyt my loue, my honour, my selfe and all, to the Affection and wise gouernment of Marino Georgio. FELICE. This Letter, was subscribed: Lyfe, to MARINO GEORGIO : and deliuered to the faithfull Macrello : with charge, that he should make knowen, his great Importunities, before Felice woulde graunt so hye a fauour: which Prouiso, might haue ben spared: for Macrello, (partly for his glorie, but chiefely, for his owne benefite) vpon delyuerie of this Letter, willed Marino, to receiue it, as a Conquest as hardly gotten, as Hercules labours: and if (quoth he) I had not indured your torments (by Imaginatio) it had not ben impossible to haue mooued Felice to rueth: Marino, heard these circumstances, with no better remembrance, then if he had ben in an Extasie: The Subscription: Lyfe to Marino :   [  Suddaine ioy or sorrow dulleth our senses. ] ouercame him with suche a sodayne passion of Ioye, who read, and a hundred times ouer read this Life letter: and for that it came from Felices sweete hand, he a thousand times kissed the Paper. Which done, by the direction of Macrello, this Conquerour Gowlde , made suche a passage, into a reputed honest Cytizens House, as, without suspition, Marino Georgio , and fayre Felice , theare (many tymes) mette, but to what purpose, I leaue to your constructions: and yet, thus much I say: this Fortune followed: Marino , in shorte space,   [  Gold maketh passage into difficulte places. ] recouered his former Complection: and it was not long, before Felice was richer, then either Father or Husband. But, O that Furie Ielousie , enuying this Accord, sent slie Suspition , to infect Malipieroes heart: who pryinge with Lynx his eyes,   [  The venemous nature of Ielosye. ] presented him a thousande causes of mistrust, which loue straite supprest with as manie contrarie imaginations of his Wiues good behauiour: inso much, that with the sharp incounter of Loue, and mystrust, poore man, he was continually afflicted. In conclusion, seeing his Wife to exceede in brauerie, and knowing himselfe, certentie: this cost coulde not come from the emptie Coffers of her vndone Parentes: and then proceedinge from others, it was impossible to bee the fauours of honest curtesie: so that armed with furie, he deferred reuenge, friende of his wiues follyes, and the enymie both of her honour, and his delyght. In fine, as heedefull, as these Louers were in their dealinges, Ielosye directed suspecte, to Marino Georgio : and moreouer, made him an eye witnesse of the iniuries done vnto Malipiero :   [  Neapolitans, are most seueare in reuenge. ] which when he assuredly knew, hee studied a while of a torture, equall to this treacherie: for who hath not hard the Neapolitan to bee the seuerest revenger of dishonor in the world, To be breefe, his bait was this: he fayned a iournay far from home, and furnished him selfe, with such an apparance of trueth, as tooke a way all colour of suspition: whiche done, with a dissembling kysse,   [  A Iudas kisse ] hee committed his wife to God, and the charge of his house, to her good gouernment: and so set forwarde towards Rome . Malipiero was no sooner a mile on his way, then Macrello certified Marino of this wished oportunitie: and Loue made both him and Felice so boulde, as in his owne house they determyned the followinge night, to exercise vppon Malipiero their wonted iniurie: but about mydnyght when mistrust was at repose,   [  A fit time, to deceaue mistrust. ] Malipiero entred the house with such a sodaine violence, as these two vnfortunate freendes, were surprysed amids their imbracemets, before they had warnyng to shift: I sowrrow to tel the rest, but trueth will haue passage. Malipiero , in his reuenge like a Lyon hungring after his pray: with his Rapier and these bitter wordes nayled Marino vnto the Bed. [  Death is too easie a scurge, for a disloyal wyfe. ] Thou Couche [[quoth] he] soyled with dishonour, washe out thy staynes, with the Adulterers blood. But holding death too easy a scurge for his wiues trespas, hee condened her to this torture, more extreme then death: Hee made an Anotomy of her welbeloued Marino , & set him in a fayre Chamber, within whiche, hee inclosed his wyfe, wtout dooing her any bodely iniurie, saue the cutting of her haire: and to say trueth, this beautifull ornament of haire, beseemeth not an Adultresse head. And to punish her the more, Malipiero caused her euerie dinner & supper to take her accustomed place,   [  Haire, the ornamentes of Chastytie. ] yt at meales shee might be tormented with the sighte of her lyuinge enemie, and all the daye with the bones, of her martired friende: neither could she quenche her thirst, but out of a Mazar, made of Marrinoes skull. But (to tell her vertue,   [  The bounde office of a Writer. ] with her vice) hir patience was suche, as shee was neuer harde to complaine of this crueltie: and yet her penitent sorrowe so great, as ye plentie of her teares, somtimes moued her iniured Husbande to pittie. But least he should be ouercome with compassion,   [  Iustice, must not yeald to the teares of Trespassers. ] manie times from dinner, hee commaunded her to her pryson: who after an humble reuerence, went behinde the Tapestrie Hanginges, and so vnto her solitarie Chamber, barred from other companye, then the gastly bones of vnfortunate Marino : whiche pennaunce shee patientlye indured, vntyll GOD , who saw yt her repentaunce was vnfayned, betweene her Husbandes iniurie, and her offence: who (when Supper was sette vppon the Boorde) seeing from behinde the Tapistrie Hanginges, a fayre Gentlewoman to appeere, somewhat pale with sorrowe, her head bare, both of attyre and Hayre, apparrelled all in black, and in her hand, her drynking Bowle of Marinoes scul, & saying neuer a word, wt a sober reuerece sitting down in ye cheefest place: was stroken with such a maze, as on the suddayne he wist not what to say. Dinner being ended, which was longer, then pleasant, either to husbande, wife, or friende: Felice , as she entered so departed. Whe, notwithstanding, leaft part of her sorowe behinde in Cornaros heart, whose cheareles countenance, when Malipiero perceyued (quoth he) let not the martyrdome of this Woman afflicte you: for her fault deserueth this vengeaunce, and so recounted the reported aduenture: And in aduantage, shewed him her prison and the Annotomie of her dishonour? and withall licensed him   [  A honorable fauour. ] to talke with Felice , to heare what plee shee had for her discharge. Uppon which warrant, quoth Cornaro , Madame, if your patience be equall with your torment, I holde you the most happie Woman of the worlde. Felice with a countenance abased, and Cheakes dewed with teares tolde him in humble wordes, that her trespasse was tenne times greater, then the torment which the Lorde of the House,   [  The true ensigne of sorrowe. ] whome shee was not worthie to call husbande, had appoynted her. And there withall, the sorrow of her hart, tooke away the vse of her tongue. Wherevppon Malipiero , ledde the Gentleman awaye, who rendred him affected thankes, in that, besides his good intertaynment, he witsafed him the honour to knowe so great a secreasie: withall, moued with compassion, hee effectually intreated Malipiero , to accept Felices sorrow the true witnes of grace & amendement,   [  True repentaunce is to be receued in satisfaction of offences. ] as satisfaction of her offence, which proceeded of frayltie, and withall importuned him, with such earnest reasons as Malipiero was content to sende both for her and his owne friendes. To bee partly ruled, and partly aduised by them in her behalfe. The parentes and friendes of euerie side seeing the   [  Perfect loue, cannot be so iniuried, but it will alwais retaine some affection. ] humilitie, sorowe, and patience, of poore Felice , were all earnest sutors for her remission. The roote of auncient loue not altogether dead in Malipiero , was comforted with their intercessions, & quickened with the hope of amendement: in so much, as vppon sollemne promise to be hencefoorth of good behauiour, he receyued her to grace: and to repayre her crased honour,   [  A reparation of dishonour. ] with the fauour of both their parentes, hee newe married fayre Felice , in which holy estate, they liued, loued, and agreed manie happie yeares afterwarde together: And with the Bones of Marino Georgio buried the remembrance of former iniuries. Maister Doctor, quoth Fabritio , you haue reported a verie necessarie Historie: for it contayneth many heedeful notes, both of Amonition, and aduise. Besides the due punishment of rashnesse in Marriage. For therein wee may see howe hungersterued want, compelleth the best natured man to deceiue his friende, and yelde vnto his owne slaunder. Againe, how that monster, Golde, conquereth the honour of the fayrest. Yea, quoth Isabella , and corrupteth the conscience of the wisest: so that this is no example of any honour to you men, because Golde intised Felice , to be disloyall to her Husbande, for it draweth manie of you, both from the feare and loue of God. Well, quoth Soranso , let it passe, Felice in her repentaunce, hath made a large amendes of her trespasse, and I feare me, if euery lyke offence were so sharpely punnished, we should haue Mazers of mens Sculles, more ordinarye then Siluer Boules, and powled Women more common then baulde men. Not so, quoth Queene Aurelia :   [  Feare of correction, brideleth the affexcions of the euill. ] for a fewe of these examples woulde bridle the incontinent affections both of man and woman, if not for the loue of vertue, for the feare of correction. After these and a fewe other Morrall notes were culled out of Doctor Mossenigos Historie. Maddam, quoth Don Dolo , if we continue this course,   [  What hurteth one instuceth the other. ] it will be a good while, before, we doe finde out the Parradice, Plato speaketh of. Be it so, quoth Queene Aurelia , but if we still continue the way to his House Hel, our errour will instructe others: and since we haue yet long respyte, it shall not be amisse euerie day to take a sundrie hie way, vntill wee finde out the true passage: And for that our Question is concluded, and our Howre Glasse ronne: we will (for this Daye, make here an ende. thirde Nightes Pastime. whiche were saused, with sundrie shorte ciuill, and pleasaunt euentes of the Gentlemen, and Gentlewomens wittes: For he, or shee, was helde of weake capacitie, that either of forestuddie, or vpon offered occasion, coulde say nothing of good regarde. In the ende, when Supper was done, and Queene AVRELIA, and the most Honourable of the companie had taken their places vppon a Scaffolde made for   [ Breuitie, is best, for Table talke. ] the nonce, there mounted, a Mountebanke , his necke bechayned with liue Adders, Snakes, Eau'ts, and twentie sundrie kinde of venemous vermines,   [  Mountibaks of Italie, are in a maner, as Englysh Pedlers. ] whose mortall stinges were taken away by Arte, & with him a Zanni , and other Actors of pleasure: who presented themselues onelie with a single desire, to recreate Segnior Philoxenus, and his worthie companie: and not with the intent of common Mountebanckers , to deceyue the people with some vnprofitable Marchandize. In the middest of this pastime, an auncient Gentleman (of the generall Societie) seeinge these Uiperous Beastes, by cunninge vsage, to be made so Domesticke and affable, whether it were vppon an impression of his owne greife or of the experience he had of an other mans Plague, I know not: but sure I am, he burst into these passions. O GOD, (quoth hee) of what mettell is a Womans tongue, which correction cannot chastise, nor lenitie quiet,   [  The strange nature of a Womans tongue. ] when these dumbe Serpentes, by the one or the other are tamed? Marie (quoth a pleasant Companion) it is made of the same mettle, that Virgils Brasen Flayle was off, which strooke both his friendes and foes. But (quoth the Gentleman) Virgyll knew, & taught others howe to pacifie this engine. It is (true quoth the other:) but in teaching the secrete vnto his Seruant, coste him his owne life. So a woman knowes howe to holde her Tongue, by hauinge of her will, but if a man thinke to stay it, he must beate her to death. A young Youth named Phrisio , thinking to winne the Spurres, by building a Fortresse for women,   [  Defences for a chidynge wyfe. ] who haue no weapons but their tongues, to defend, and offend, tooke vppon him, to prooue a chiding wife, though shee bee a little vnpleasaunt, both profitable and necessarie: his reasons were these. Unsauerie receytes tourne to holsome effectes: The strongest Poyson is pleasaunt in taste, and the remedie for the poysoned, offendeth the mouthe with tartnesse: Nettles that stinges the Hande, maketh Pottage to comforte the heart: the bloude of the Scorpion cureth the biting of the Uiper. If poysoned, vnpleasant, and bitter thinges retaynd a vertue for the benefite of man: in my imagination (quoth hee) an vnquiete wife is not vnprofitable though shee bee a little vnpleasaunt: Her anger keepeth Seruauntes in awe, and her quicknesse ouerseeth their negligence: If her tongue runne at ryot, where shee huntes, there is store of abuse, which must be chased either with blowes or wordes: If the furye of her speache offende her Husbande, it is lyke, that) her outrage, groweth from his faulte: And where an iniurie is offered, it is sufferable, yf the wronge bee blamed: but which maketh a full amendes, for her furious moode: as the clowdy and raynie daie, lightly cleareth towardes night: euen so, though she bitterly scowld at boorde, shee will be sure, to kisse sweetely a bedde. The auncient Gentlemen,   [  In blaming, mildnes is to be vsed. ] commending the quick wit of this yong Gentleman, vsed thys circumstaunce before he refelled his error. Ah (quoth he) if witt were as aduised in Iudgement, as he is ready in conseight: his imaginations, would turne to wonderfull effectes: but as fairest colours soonest staine, as sweetest flowers are blasted with a breath: as beautyful creatures, are blemished with a little care, as ye brightest Sunne threateneth suddaine raine: yea, as euerye mortall thing hath his imperfection:   [  Wit simply is imperfect. ] euen so, witt beinge mortall, and assigned by Nature, to make man glorious, aboue other creatures, by rashnes, corrupts the ripenes of his conseightes: and to good purpose, his pryde is thus abated: for otherwise, man which enioyeth witt, to worshippe his Creator, and to lyue content, with the liberties of the sea, and to keepe him with in the limits of the earth, woulde search the secreats of heauen: and I thinke, dispossesse Pluto of hell. Yong Gentleman (quoth he) I vse not this ceremony to represse your libertie of speache: for the error of youre rashnes, I will refell with reason and experience: but least heareafter you should be as arrogant in opinion, as you are ripe in conseight: I haue thought good, friendlye, and breefelye to signifie your imperfection: and nowe to aunswere your late suggestion. I affirme that Nature hath created nothing to a needlesse purpose: but notwithstanding, our abuse, or mischance, changeth hurtefull thinges, into occasions of our healpe: Surfit, and Sicknes only, comendeth Medicine: and as you affirme, the bloud of a Scorpion , cureth the biting of the Viper . But take away the cause, which proceedeth from our greefe, and you shall finde medicine, an enemye to health: and the stinge of a Scorpion , no better then death: and trust me, he is to be reckened a foole, and his misfortune to passe vnreleeued, that wilfully indammageth his health in hope of remedy. In like sorte let him liue vnpittyed, to ouersee the slacknesse of his seruaunts, who wyll marry a wife, whose tongue shall ouer-rule himselfe. But more perticularly to discribe the properties of an vnquiet wife, and more largely to discourse the displeasures of her vnfortunate husband: I will approoue her lowrings, as vnprofitable, as his life is vnpleasaunt: you say her quicknesse ouerseeth the negligence of seruaunts: but I affirme, that her curstnesse maketh them as swift to runne away, as they were slowe to serue her: and common vse avowes, that often shyfte is neyther beneficyall for Mayster nor   [  Shift, is vnprofitable, for Maister and Seruaunt. ] Seruaunt: for proofe, as the rowling Stone gathereth no Mosse, and want of vse canckereth Iron, in likewise thrifte flyeth the fleeting Seruaunt, and idlenesse consumeth his abylytie of seruice. Now touching the euill reckening of those which are serued: their wanderyng seruantes not onely charge their common accountes, with double wages, but with secret pylferyng, they sette theyr Maisters in more deepe arrerages. The Gretians that in tymes paste neither vsed medicyne for sycknesse, nor patience in aduersitye, but vppon euery great vexation, poisoned them selues with venemous Cienta .   [  Cienta, a venomous Herbe, one sort wherof is supposed to be Hemlocke. ] In their Histories remember more, that haue voluntarily died, through the violence of theyr Wyfes tounges, then of any other calamitye. Diogenes beeyng demaunded the diuersitye in euill, betweene a Scoulde and a Harlot? aunswered: They differ as the Uiper dooth from the Crockadil: for the Scoulde, sayeth he, with outrage destroyeth her Husband, and the other with dissemblyng loue, consumeth hym to death. And so concluded them bothe ennemyes to lyfe,   [  A needefull regarde for yonge Gentleme. ] and quiet lyuing of man. Phrisio , beeing bothe modestly warned, and throughly aunsweared, with a bashefull grace replyed: that the grauetye of hys person, and the sounde reason in his wordes, had taken from hym, all occasion of further Question, vnlesse that Women were his Iudges. This wittie shift mooued such as were within the hearing   [  An ill cause asketh a partiall Iudge. ] to smyle, for where the cause is ill, it is necessarie to seeke a Iudge that is partiall, and which commended Phrisios gouernment, vppon a small check he left to contend, with this auncient Gentleman: for yonge men, although theyr wittes be good, are not Priuiledged to Dispute with the grauer sort, without lycence, intreatie, or great reuerence. By this time the Mountibanck , with discribing the quallities of his Uermin, and the Zanni in showing the knauish conditions of his Maister, had wasted a good part of the night, and wearyed the moste part of the company, so that desyre of repose, sommoned them vnto their lodgeings. FINIS. Containing: varietie of necessarie Discourse, and yet withall, the greater part appertaining to the generall argument of Marriage. as the fayning of Poets, may be held for Morrall truthes, where as they affirme, that the bytter mone of Orpheus tongue, together, with the passionate sound of his Instrument, mooued suche ruthe in infernall creatures, as while he was a suter to Pluto , for the restitution of his Wife Euridice , his plaints so Charmed the torments of Hell, as for the time, the Gripe forbare to teare vpon Titius growing hart. Tantalus indeuoured not to drinke: Danaes Daughters, lefte filling of theyr bryncklesse Tub: toyling Sisiphus , sate and eased himselfe vpon his rowling Stone: yea and Pluto ouercharged with pittie, made restitution of Euridice . This sorrow to heare, that Queene Aurelia by some distemperature, was sick, and kept her Chamber, wrought such greefes in the heartes of the whole company, that they hounge theyr heads in disgrace, like Garden Flowers: which (seeming as teares) are cloyed with the dewe of a fowle misling daye. Among the rest Ismarito ,   [  True sorrovve is knovvne rather by sighes then vvords. ] although he vsed not so many words of lament, as some other did, yet, with the teares of his heart, he solemnized the true Rites of a Mourner: and to saye truthe, where the tongue hath free passage to talke, the heart is occupyed with no great greefe. Segnior Phyloxenus , seeing Ismarito in this passion, and that occasion entertayned him with no other businesse: while the rest of the company were hearing of a lyttle superstitious seruice, lead him into a very beautifull Gallerie, where the Mappes of the worlde were so artificially set foorth in Painting,   [  The Pope hath begun, and not yet finished a moste rare Gallerie. ] as I doubt the Popes Microcosmos at Latteran , which hath beene this sixteene yeares a making, wylbe ended with no more perfection.   [ Beautifull attires for a Gallerie. ] In this Gallerie were the Pictures of all Christian Princes: and in an other place by themselues, the Pictures of certaine Heathen Rulers: and in an other rancke, the Pictures of so many learned men and graue Magistrates, as he could through freendship or rewarde obtaine. After much discourse of the especiall Monuments, wherewith this pleasaunt Gallerie was attyred, Segnior Phyloxenus brought Ismarito a fayre booke, wherin were diuers rare deuises,   [  An espetiall Booke of deuises. ] and (directing him to Pensils, Colers and other necessaries of Harrowldry) requested that he would helpe to beautify the sayd Booke, with some ingenious remembraunce. Sir ([quoth] Ismarito ) I haue already recorded your good fauours in the Table of my heart: and I beseeche you that this fayre Booke may not be blemished by me, or remaine a wytnesse to you of my indiscression. This nicenesse ([quoth] Philoxenus ) professeth more then ordinarie knowledge, and therefore I coniure you, by the affection you beare me, to satisfye my request. Ismarito vpon this importunitie, because he would not leaue a suspition, that his curiositie grew rather of simplicitie then discression:   [  Ismaritos deuise, Pharos, a Lanterne or light, deuised by King Ptolome, surnamed Philadelphus, for the benefit of Nauigation in those parts, which cost 800. Tallents. ] and missing among the Moderne Monuments, their Pictures, the vertues of whose Fame, are blazed in the Capitols of the whole world: he tooke a Pensill, and with the same drew an Ileland, and ouer the middest thereof, made a Pharos , which shyned lyke the Sunne, and therein a Phenix , bathing of her selfe, whose gleaming reflexions, shined ouer all Loegria, Cambria , and the greatest part of Albania , and extended vnto a great parte of the Continent , especially vnto that parte that lay betweene the Occean , the Mediterrane , and the great Sea called Euxinus Pontus , and vnderneath writ. Pharos Europe, non Africe. Phyloxenus aduisedly regarded this deuise, before he would either require Ismaritos intent, or giue his owne iudgement. In the end, deuining what should be the secret meaning of this Simbole or Ensigne: quoth he, Segnior Ismarito , this Cognizance of your quicke wit, pleaseth me much, and withall remembreth me of a neglected curtesie, which (I thinke) will showe you the Image of your Phenix , and blason the secresie of your whole deuise: and thereuppon he lead Ismarito into a moste curious priuie Gallerie, where (drawing a faire Curtaine, and reuerently kissing his hand) he shewed Ismarito the Picture of a foorth, with which a Marchaunt of Venice , who traffiqued toward the Westerne Islands, presented him: which Ismarito beheld, with a regarde so duetifull, as their needed no glose, to expound the zealous affection of his heart. And by her was stalled a goodly Gentleman, Crowned with a Scepter, whom Ismarito knew not, other wise the by imagination, in beholding his Armes, who bare Gu , an Eagle displaied Crowned Ar . And ([quoth] Phyloxenus ,) when I followed the Frenche Court, I admyred a young Prince of rare towardlinesse, whose counterfeit at my departure I brought with me, and there withall shewed Ismarito a Picture, which he verye well knew, and in it were written in Charracters, these three woordes: Hercules Franciscus valesius . And by this Prince stoode an other counterfeit, whose Armes Ismarito forgot, but well he remembred his Posie was, Je le meintiendray . The counterfeits of other Potentates there were, which Philoxenus placed in the ranck of these Princes for some regarded vertues, knowne vnto himselfe. And by his owne testimonie, he prised these counterfeits, abooue all the Monuments (auncient or Moderne) which beautified his Pallace. Upon which warrant,   [  A regard in straungers, to teache Subiectes their dutie. ] Sir, [quoth] Ismarito , the Honourable regarde that you haue of these Princes shaddowes, beeing a strainger, prescribeth rules of dutie, vnto theyr Subiectes, humbly to reuerence their sacred Persons. Indeede quoth he, it is but iust, their tongues crie, God saue their Highnesse , and theyr hearts aunswer, So be it . After Segnior Philoxenus and Ismarito had had some conference, as well touching the meaning of this Pharos , as of some other deuises figured in Philoxenus Booke: the Trumpets sound, gaue knowledge of Dinner: so that this priuate conference was adiorned, till Segnior Philoxenus pleasure should renue it. When Ismarito entered into the great Chamber, and among so many fayre Flowers, missing the glorious Rose ,   [  The Rose is the most glorious of Flovvers. ] his countenaunce well showed, that his mornings sorrowe had beene but a sleepe, which new awakened, streaked with the increase of passion, yea such was the pensiuenesse of the whole company, as the fyrst seruice, represented rather a Funerall Dinner, then a Christmas feaste.   [  An vnexpected good nevves, is double vvelcome. ] But in the mydest of a storme, as Phebus sometymes behouldeth the Earth, with a cheerefull countenaunce, so in the deapth of this heauines, there was newes brought of Queene Aurelias amendment, who commaunded the chosen company, after Dinner, to attend her comming, in the chamber of pleasure. This knowledg so quickned the dulled spyrytes of the Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen, as they agreed, for one day (if Queene Aurelia pleased) to alter the sollemne course in theyr ordenarie exercyse:   [  Myrthe cureth as much as Medicine, vvhere the malladie is not mortall. ] for where the malladie is not mortall, mirth cureth as much as medicine, and houlding this determynacion, they, the rest of Dinner, in actions of pleasure, fullie auenged themselues of the iniurie of former sorrowe. After Dinner was ended, and the company had a while pawsed, to set themselues in good order: vpon a new sommons, the appointed number, martched into this Chamber of Pleasures, which was hanged with a ritche Tapistrie of voluntarie deuise, euery Tree, Flower, Byrde,   [  A sumptuous Tapistrie. ] Beaste, or what someuer was therein resemblod, in his proper coloures of Silke, was portrayed. The Sheepe with theyr Fleeces fryzeled, the Beastes curiously raysed with rawe Silke, like vnto theyr naturall heayre, the Trees beautified with proper leaues and fruite, the Rose with his Buds, Sprigs, and other attyre: and to be breefe, euery other Flower was counterfaited with such Arte, as they seemed to be naturall.   [  Men may be deceiued vvith out the slaunder of simplycitie. ] Yea a man might haue beene indifferently wise enough, in other ordinarie matter, and yet haue aduentured to haue gathered a Flower, or haue plucked an Apple, in these hangings, and who so was best acquainted, could not wearie his eyes in the beholding of them: so that the very attyre of this Chamber walles, had an intertaining vertue,   [  Curious sights, please more then vnciuill people. ] were there no other creature in the place. Queene Aurelia attended with the Ladyes and Gentlewomen, presented her selfe, before the younge Gentlemen had halfe gazed theyr will. The company saluted theyr Soueraigne with a reuerent curtesie, whose cheekes, somewhat more bleake then ordinary,   [  A lyttle sicknesse maketh an alteration in beautie. ] with this distemperature, resembled in colloure the perfect white Gilliflowre, a little streaked with Carnation. After some priuate talke betweene her, and one or two of her fauoured Seruaunts, she tooke her place where she pleased, and the rest as they were accustomed, which doone, the Eunick with a well tuned voyce, vnto the Lute, Songe this following, Care away . thy thornie thoughts, the heart to death doth woud Thou makest the fayre, seeme like a blasted Tree, by thee greene yeares with hoarie heares are grownd. Which makes me singe, to solace mine annoy: Care, Care, adewe, my hart doth hope for ioye. Care, Care, adewe, thou riuall of delight, returne into, the Caue of deepe Dispayre: Thou art no Gueste, to harbour neere my spright, whose poisoned syghtes, infect the very Ayre. Wherefore I singe, to sollace myne annoye: Care, Care, adewe, my hart doth hop for ioye. Care, Care, adewe, and welcome pleasure now, thou wishe of ioye, and ease of sorowe bothe: To weare thy weede, I make a sollemne vowe, let Tyme, or Chaunce, be pleased, or be wrothe. And therefore singe, to sollace myne annoy: Care, Care, adewe, my heart doth hop for ioye. The note of this Songe, was farre better then the Ditty, but for that it aunswered the determination of the company, it passed for currant: whereupon, Maddame (quoth Fabritio ) if it be your pleasure, we wyll this day varrie from our wonted course, and according to our Theame, begin with some myrthe, to sharpen our wittes: for grauer discourses,   [  One square breaketh no custome. ] we haue time inough besides, to beate out the passage to Platoes Paradise. Use your discressions quoth Queene Aurelia , and by her commaundement Bergetto was appointed to begin the exercise, who obaying, reported this following aduenture, of Fryer Inganno . where S. Fraunces lyeth intombed. There sometymes dwelled a fayre younge countery woman named Farina : and for that her house was in the hye waie, to S. Fraunces holy relykes, she was many tymes visyted with Friers of his order, who were intertayned. rather for their habyt, then their honestie: for the poore ignorant people, reuerenced Sainct Fraunces , as a seconde Christe , for whose sake, they hould his Disciples, not inferiour to Saincts: amonge manye that visited Farinas house, Fryer Inganno , a smugge Chapleine, euer sealed his blessings, vppon his dames lippes, and yet, without suspicion of the husband, or dishonest intent of the wife:    [  It is saide, S. Frances subdued incontinent desires, by tumbling naked in frost and Snowe. ] for such greeting was euer taken for a holly fauour. Uppon a time, after Fryer Inganno , had wel beaked himselfe, with a warme fire, and a good breakefast, the spirit that saint Fraunces , was driuen to coniure downe, by tumbling naked in the frost and snowe, tempted his Disciple with suche sweete motions, as he was mynded willfully to abiure heauen,   [ A premiditated sinne. ] rather then to deale so roughly with the deuill. And taking aduantage, of the good opinion, the ignoraunt, heald of his holynes: and was so bould,   [  The tricke of a knauish Seruaunt. ] with saincte Fraunces (his Maister) as to make a wanton match in his name: so that after he had a while considered, of his perswasion, vppon a quiet oportunitie: Blessed art thou ([quoth] he) among the Appenine countreywemen, for Sainct Fraunces , from Heauen,   [  A gentle perswasion. ] hath behelde thy charitable vsage of his Disciples, and the last Night after, I had prayed with great deuotion, before his Image, I behelde him in the Maiestie of an Angell, fayre yonge, lustie, and in euery proportion like my selfe, and nothyng at all, like his meagre Cripple Image: So that I was in doubt, of beynge transfourmed out of my selfe, tyll with a meeke voice, he sayd: Be not dismayde, I am thy Maister, Inganno , and am come, to bestow my blessinges vpon the good Appenine dames, that for my sake cherish you, my Disciples: But with an especiall Affection, I wil visite the good Dame Farina : And for that, her Feminine weakenes, can not indure my Heauenly presence, I wyll many times borrowe thy earthly shape: and in my name, go salute Farina, and showe her, that this night, in that her Husbande is from home, I meane to visite her: wyll her to leaue open the Doores, because I purpose to come as Fryer Inganno , and not as Saint Fraunces . This is his message,   [  Ignoraunce heareth euery tale as trueth. ] therfore, as I began, I end: blessed art thou among the Appenine countrie Dames: The poore woman, as apparant as this trecherie was, had not the power to mistrust,   [  Flatterie eateth the bread of the Iust. ] but gaue the Fryer a good almes for his newes, and saide she would attende Saint Fraunces blessed will. Away goeth the Fryer, with a light hart and a heauy Cowle: but God, to punish his lewde intent, & to preserue her from sinnyng through, ignoraunce, so tyckled her hart with ioy,   [  A note of litle secreacy in a woman. ] of this blessinge at hande, as to welcome Saint Fraunces shee must needes haue the Belles roonge: The Prieste of the Parrishe hearing the cause, smelt out the Fryers counning, and was glad to take one of those Beggers in a Pitfall that with glorious lyes,   [  Enuy setteth hatred betweene fellowes of euery vocation. ] had robbed him of his Parishioners deuotions, and withall, perswaded her with suche reasons, as shee was fully resolued of the Fryers deceite: And to bee aduenged, by the Parsons direction, shee caused Leayda to lye in her Bed, a Mayde so ougly, sluttish and deformed, as thorough the Parish, shee was called, the Furie of Lothsomnesse. Aboute ten of the Clocke, findynge the Doores open, Frier Inganno mountes into Farinas Chamber, and without light or leaue, leaps into her bed: but hee had not blessed Leaydaes lyppes,   [  An vnwelcome salutation. ] before the Priest, Farina , and others, entred with Taper and Torchlighte, singing Salue Saincte Francisce : And kneeling about his Bed sides, sung, Sancte Francisce, ora pro nobis . The poore Fryer, lyke a Fox in a grin, being both intrapt, and imbraste by a Hag of Hel,   [  Pleasure in others increaseth sorrow in the afflicted. ] cryed from his hart: A dolore inferni, libera me Domine. After the Prieste and the rest of the companye, were wearye of laughinge: and the Fryer almost dead with weeping: It is an office of Charitie (quoth the Priest) to put Saint Frances againe in his Tumbe: for it is so long since hee was in the Worlde,   [  Enuy, and rude people, are not passifyed with praiers of the afflicted. ] that he hath forgot the way backe, into Heauen. The Fryer learing lyke the Theefe, that honge on the left side of Christe, tooke all with patience: for well hee wyst, Prayer booted not. Well, for that night, they bounde and stript him, lyke a dead Coarse: and in stead of sweete Flowers,   [  Rude people extreame revengers. ] laid him in a bundell of Nettles. The next mornyng, the rude Countrie people (who in reuenge are without ciuyllytie or order) cruelly scourged the poore Fryer. And (setting hym the forenoone naked in the Sunne) annoynted his bodie with Honey: so that the Hornets, Waspes and Flyes, tormented him with the paynes of Hell. In the afternoone, with a hundred Torches, Tapers, and other waxen lyghtes: this rustick multitude, caryed seconde Saint Fraunces vnto his Tumbe: and had not other Fryers vsed mylde & plawsible requests, in his behalf,   [  The best way to win the communaltie. ] they would surely haue buried him aliue: for threatning, increaseth a tumult: when faire wordes, may peraduenture staye it. The poore Fryer discharged from the handes of these vngentle people, learned afterwardes to be more warie: but for all this punishment, was nothinge the honester. For amonge men of his Habit, remayneth an opynion, that the faultes, whiche the Worlde seeth not, GOD punnisheth not. After the Company had wel laughed at Fryer Ingannoes pennaunce, Queene Aurelia axed maister Doctor, the Archedetracter of Women, how many suche stories he had read of the religious Dames? None (quoth hee) that hath beene so sorely punished, but of an number that haue as hyghly trespassed. What (quoth Helena Dulce ) by suche subtyll practises?   [  Men offende subtilly, and women simply, ] No ([quoth] the Doctor) but through simple affection. Well (quoth Aluisa Vechio ,   [  Womes euyls are wryt in their forheds. ] their euyls are written in their foreheades, that slaunderous mens tongues may reade and inlarge them. And your great euils are buried in the bottome of your hartes that vnlesse the Deuill meane to shame you,   [  Mens faultes, lye hydde in their hartes. ] the worlde knoweth not how to blame you. This was the Gentlewomens day, wherefore the ciuill Gentlemen, would not offer to crosse them much: so that following their aduantage, Madam (quoth Isabella ,) with your fauour and patience, I will reporte an Historie, that shall open suche a haynous trecherie done by a   [  A ciuill curtesie in a Gentelman. ] man, as shall take away all possibilytie from a woman to commit so impious an Act. Queene Aurelia , willed her to proceede, and the whole company seemed to be attentiue: whereupon Isabella reported as followeth. therof, is liuely set out in a Comedie, by the Reporter of the whole worke, but yet neuer presented vpo stage. ] the Turkes, rayned as Kinge of Bohemia : for to well gouerne the free Cities of his Realme, hee sent diuers worthy Maiestrates. Among the rest, he gaue the Lorde Promos the Lieutennauntship of Iulio : who in the beginning of his gouernment, purged the Cittie of many ancient vices, and seuerely punished new offenders. In this Cittie, there was an olde custome (by the suffering of some Maiestrates, growne out of vse) that what man so euer comitted Adulterie, should lose his head: And ye woman offender should euer after be infamously noted, by the wearing of some disguised apparrell: For the man was helde to bee the greatest offender,   [  A hard Lawe for incontinent persons. ] and therefore had the seuerest punishment. Lorde Promos, with a rough execution, reuiued this Statute, and in the hyest degree of iniurie, brake it hymselfe, as shall appeare by the sequell of Andrugioes aduentures. This Andrugio by the yeelding fauour of fayre Polina , trespassed against this ordinaunce, who through enuie, was accused, and by Lorde Promos condemned, to suffer execution. The wofull Cassandra, Andrugioes Sister, prostrates her selfe at Lorde Promos Feete, and with more teares then wordes, thus pleaded for her Brothers lyfe. Most noble Lorde, and worthy Iudge, voutchsafe, mee the fauour to speake, whose case is so desperate, as vnlesse you beholde mee with the eyes of mercie, the frayle trespasse, of condemned Andrugio my Brother, will bee the death of sorrowfull Cassandra , his innocent Sister. I wil not presume, to excuse his offence, or reproche the Lawe of rigor: for in the generall construction, hee hath done most euill, & the Law hath iudged but what is right: But (reuerent Iudge, pardon yt necessitie maketh mee here tel,   [ Lawe adiudgeth, by the generall offence. ] that your wisdome already knoweth.) The most Soueraigne Iustice, is crowned with Laurell, although shee bee gyrt with a Sword: And this priueledge shee giueth vnto her Administrators: that they shall mitigate the seueretie of the Law, according to ye quallyty of the offence.   [  Iustice, is more renowned by lenytie, then seueritie. ] Then, that Iustice bee not robbed of her gratious pitty, listen Good Lorde Promos , to the nature of my Brothers offence, and his able meanes to repayre the iniurie. Hee hath defyled, no Nuptiall Bed, the stayne wherof dishonoureth the guyltlesse Husband: Hee hath committed no violent Rape. In which Act the iniuried Mayde can haue no amends. But with yeelding consent of his Mistresse, Andrugio hath onlye sinned through Loue, and neuer ment but with Marriage to make amendes. I humbly beseeche you to accept his satisfaction,   [  A good cause to mooue pytie. ] and by this Example, you shall be as much beloued for your clemencye, as feared for your seueritie. Andrugio shalbe well warned, and hee with his Sister wofull Cassandra , shall euer remayne, your Lordships true Seruantes. Promos eares were not so attentiue, to heare Cassandras ruethful tale, as his eyes were settled to regarde her excellent Beautie.   [  Loue, fauoureth no degre ] And Loue, that was the appoincted Headsman of Andrugio , became now the Soueraigne of his Iudges thought. But because he would seeme to bridle his passions, he aunswered: fayre Damsell, haue patience, you importune me with an impossybylytie: he is condempned by Lawe, then without iniurie to Lawe, he can not be saued.   [  Princes Prerogatiue, are aboue Lawe. ] Princes and their Deputies Prerogatiues (quoth she) are aboue ye Lawe. Besides, Lawe, truelie construed, is but the amends of Iniurie:   [  The true intent of the Lawe. ] and where, the faulte may bee valued, and amendes had, the Breache of Lawe is sufficiently repayred. Quoth Lorde Promos , your passions mooueth more then your proofes:   [  A good turne vpon an euyl cause. ] and for your sake, I wyll repriue Andrugio, and studie how to do you ease, without apparant breache of Lawe. Cassandra , recomforted, with humble thankes receyued his fauoure,   [ Aucthorytie, in euyll Maiestrates, is a Scourge vnto the good. ] and in great haste goeth too participate this hope, with her dying Brother: But oh, that Aucthorytie, should haue power, to make the vertuous to doo amisse, as well, as throughe Correction, to enforce the vicious to fall vnto goodnesse. Promos , is a witnes of this Priuiledge: who not able to subdue his incontinent loue, and (withal) resolued, that Cassandra would neuer be ouercome, with fayre wordes, large promises,   [  A monstrous request. ] or riche rewardes: demaunded the spoyle of her Uirginitie, for raunsome of her Brothers lybertie. Cassandra , ymagyned at the first, that Lorde Promos , vsed this speache, but to trie her behauiour: Aunswered hym so wisely,   [  Vnlesse they be reprobate, good Examples, may refourme the wicked. ] as if he had not ben the Ryuall of Uertue, he could not but haue suppressed his lewve Affection, and haue subscribed to her iust petition: But to leaue circumstaunces, Promos was fiered with a vicious desyre, which must be quenched with Cassandraes yeldyng loue, or Andrugio must dye. Cassandra , mooued with a chaste disdayne, departed, with the resolution, rather to dye her selfe, then to stayne her honour: And with this heauie newes, greeted her condemned Brother: poore man, alas, what should he do? Life was sweete: but to be redeemed with his Sisters Infamie, could not, but be alwayes vnsauerie. To perswade her to consente, was vnnaturall: too yealde to Death, was more greeuous. To choose the leaste of these euylles, was difficult:   [  A hard choice of two euyls. ] to studie long was daungerous. Fayne would he lyue, but Shame cloased his mouth, when he attempted to perswade his Sister. But Necessytie, that maistereth both Shame & feare, brake a passadge for his imprysoned intent. Sweete Cassandra , (quoth he) that men loue, is vsuall, but to subdue Affection, is impossyble: and so thornie are the motions of incontinent Desire, as to finde ease,   [  The force of Necessytie. ] the tongue is only occupied to perswade. The Purse, is euer open to entice,   [  The force of Loue. ] and wheare neither words nor Giftes can corrupt (with the mightie) force shall constrayne, or dispight, auenge. That Promos do loue, is but iust, thy Beautie commaundes hym. That Promos be refused, is more iust, because Consent is thy Shame. Thou maiste refuse and lyue: but he beynge reiected, I die: For wantyng his wyll in thee, he wyll wreake his teene on mee. This is my hard estate: My lyfe, lieth in thy Infamie, and thy honour in my death . Which of these euylles be leaste, I leaue for thee to iudge. The wofull Cassandra , answered: that Death,   [  A hard Fortune, ] was the leaste: whose Darte, we can not shunne: when Honour, in Deathes dispight, outlyueth tyme. It is true (quoth Andrugio ,) but thy Trespasse, wyll be in the leaste degree of blame: For, in forced Faultes,   [  Death is to be preferred, before dishonorable lyfe. ] Iustice sayth, there is no intent of euyll. Oh Andrugio , (quoth she) Intent, is now adayes, lytle considred: thou art not codemned by the intent, but by the strickt worde of the Law: so shall my crime bee reproched, and the forced cause passe vnexcused:   [  The venemous nature of Enuy. ] and such is ye venome of Enuye, one euill deede shall disgrace ten good turnes: and in this yeelding, so shall I be valued: Enuye, Disdaine,   [  The vertuous are assured of many enemies, and incertaine of any friendes. ] Spight, Mallice, Sclaunder, and many moe furies will endeuour to shame mee, and the meanest vertue, wyll blush to help to support my honour: so that I see no lybertie for thee but Death, nor no ease for mee but to hasten my ende. O yes (quoth Andrugio, for if this offence be known, thy fame will bee enlarged, because it will lykewise bee knowne,   [  A cause that may excuse the breach of honour. ] that thou receauedst dishonor to giue thy Brother lyfe: If it be secreat, thy Conscience wyl be without scruple of guiltinesse. Thus, knowne, or vnknowne, thou shalt be deflowred, but not dishonested, and for amends wee both shall lyue. This further hope remaineth, that as the Gilliflower, both pleaseth the eye and feedeth the sence: euen so the vertue of thy chast behauiour may so grace thy bewty, as Promos filthie lust,   [  A faint hope. ] may bee turned into faithfull loue: and so moue him, to salue thy honour in making thee hys wife. Or for conscience, forbeare to doe so heynous an iniurie. Soueraigne Maddame, and you faire Gentlewomen, (quoth Isabella ) I intreate you in Cassandras behalfe, these reasons well wayed, to iudge her yeelding a constrainte, and no consent: who werie of her owne life, and tender ouer her brothers, with the teares of her louely eyes, bathed his Cheekes, with this comfortable sentence. Lyue Andrugio, and make much of this kisse, which breatheth my honour into thy bowels: and draweth the infamie of thy first trespasse into my bosome.   [ A louyng kys. ] The sharpe incounters betweene life and death, so occupied Andrugio sences, that his tongue had not the vertue, to bid her fare well. To greeue you with the hearing of Cassandras secreate plaints, were an iniurie: vertuous Ladies, for they concluded with their good fortune, and euerlasting fame: But for that her offence grew neyther of frayltie, free wyl, or any motion of a Woman,   [  A good consideration in Cassandra. ] but by ye meere inforcement of a man, because she would not staine the modest weedes of her kynde, shee attired her selfe in the habit of a Page, and with the bashfull grace of a pure Uirgin, shee presented wicked Promos, Andrugioes precious ransome. This Deuill, in humaine shape, more vicious then Hyliogabalus of Rome : and withall,   [  A damnable offence. ] as cruell as Denis of Sicyll : receaued this Iuell with a thousande protestations of fauour. But what should I say? In the beginnyng of his loue, Promos was metamorphosed into Priapus : and of a Feende what may we expect? but vengeaunce heaped vpon villany. And therefore, let it not seeme straunge, that after this Helhound, had dishonoured Cassandra , hee sent his warrant, to the Gayler pryuely, to execute Andrugio , and with his head crowned with these two Breefes, in Promos name, to present Cassandra :   [  A villanous Ingratitude. ] Fayre Cassandra, as Promos promist thee: From Pryson loe, he sendes thy Brother free. This was his Charge, whose cursed wyll had ben executed, had not God by an especiall prouidence, at the howre of his Death,   [  An especiall prouidence of God. ] possessed Andrugio with the vertues of the two braue Romanes, Marcus Crassus , and Marius , the one of whiche, by the force of his tongue, and the other by the motions of his eyes, caused the Axe to fall out of the Headsmans hand, and mollyfyed his cruell mynde. With lyke compassion, the Gayler (in hearinge Andrugios hard aduenture) left his resolution: And vppon a solempne othe, to liue vnknowne, yea to his deare Sister, he gaue him life, and in the dead of the night, betooke him to God, and to good fortune:   [  A signe of an honest nature ] which done this good Gayler tooke the head of a yonge man newe executed, who somewhat resembled Andrugio : and according to lewde Promos commaundement made a present thereof to Cassandra . How vnwelcome this Present was, the testimonie of her former sorowes somewhat discouer: but to giue her present passion a true grace,   [  An vnwelcome present ] were the talke of Prometheus , or such a one as hath had experience of the anguishes of hell. O quoth shee, sweete Andrugio , whether shall I firste lament thy death? exclaime of Promos iniurie? or bemone my owne estate, depriued of honour? and which is worse, cannot die, but by the violence of my owne hands. Alas, the least of these greefes, are to heauie a burden for a man, then all ioyned in one poore womans hearte, can not be eased but by death: and to be auenged of iniurious Fortune, I wil forthwith cut my Fillet of life. But so shall Promos lewdnesse escape vnpunished: what remedie? I am not of power to reuenge: to complayne, I expresse my owne infamie, but withal, proclaime his vilanie: and to heare his lewdnes reproued, woulde take away the bitternesse of my death. I will goe vnto the King, who is iust and mercifull, hee shall heare the ruthfull euents of Promos Tyrrannie: and to giue him example of vengeaunce, I will seale my complaintes with my dearest bloode. Continuing this determination, Cassandra buried her imagined brothers heade, and with speed iornyed vnto King Coruinus Court: Before whose presence when shee arriued, her mourninge Attyre, but especially her modest countenaunce moued him to beholde her with an especiall regarde. Cassandra (vppon the graunt of audience) with her eyes ouercharged with teares,   [  A mischiefe well preuented. ] reported, the alreadie discoursed Accidentes, with suche an apparaunce of greefe, as the King and his Attendants were astonied to heare her: and sure had shee not been happily preuented, shee had concluded her determination, with chast Lucretias destiny. The King comforted her with many gratious words   [  A noble fauour. ] & promised to take such order, yt (although he could not be reuiued) her brothers death should fully be reuenged, and her crased honour, repayred, withoute blemysh of her former reputation. Cassandra , vpon these comfortable wordes, a lytell succoured her afflicted hart, and with patience, attended the Iustice of ye King: who with a chosen companie, made a Progresse to Iulio , and entred the Town,   [  A necessarie pollye ] with a semblaunce of great fauour towardes Promos : by that colour, to learne what other corrupte Maiestrates, ruled in the Cittie: for well he knewe, that Byrdes of a feather, would flie together, and wicked men would ioyne in Affection to boulster each others euil. After this gratious King, had by heedfull intelligence vnderstoode the factions of the people, vnlooked for of the Magistrates, he caused a proclamation to be published: in which was a clause, that if anie person coulde charge anie Magistrate or Officer, with anie notable or haynous offence, Treason, Murder, Rape, Sedition,   [  A Ryal grace ] or with any such notorious Crime: where they were the Iudges of the multitude, hee woulde himselfe bee the Iudge of them, and doe iustice vnto the meanest. Uppon this Proclamation it was a hell to heare, the exclamations of the poore, [  The clamors of the poore, and the consciences of the rich, like Hell. ] and the festered consciences of the rich, appeared as lothsome, as the Riuer of Stix . Among manie that complayned, and receiued iudgemet of comfort, Cassandras Processe was presented, who lead betweene sorrow and shame, accused Promos to his face. The euidence was so playne, as the horrour of a guiltie conscience reaued Promos of all motions of excuse:   [  Sorrowe and Shame, the Attendantes of Cassandra, ] so that holding vp his hande, among the worst degree of theeues, the litle hope that was leaft, moued him to confesse the crime, and with repentance to sue for mercy. O (quoth the King) such espetial mercy were tyrannie   [  An vnusual place for a Iudge. ] to a common wealth. No Promos no, Hoc facias alteri, quod tibi vis fieri : You shall be measured with the grace you bestowed on Andrugio . O God (quoth hee) if men durst bark as Dogges, manie a Iudge in the world would be bewrayed for a theefe:   [  A necessarie regarde in a Prince, ] It behoueth a Prince to know to whom hee committeth Authoritie, least the Sword of Iustice, appointed to chasten the lewde,   [  Princes beres the blame of euyll Officsrr extortion. ] wound the good: & where good subiects are wronged, euill Officers receaue the benefit, and their Soueraignes beareth the blame. Well, wicked Promos , to scourge thy impious offences, I heere giue sentence, that thou foorthwith marry Cassandra , to repayre her honour by thee violated, & that the next day thou lose thy head,   [  A iust Iudgement. ] to make satisfaction for her Brothers death. This iust Iudgement of the good kinge, in the first point, was foorthwith executed: But sacred is the Authoritie, that the vertues of the good,   [ The good protect the lewde ] are a Sheelde vnto the lewde: So sweete Cassandra , who (simply) by vertue ouercame the spight of Fortune: In this marriadge was charged with a new assault of sorrow: and preferring the dutie of a wife,   [  The duetie of a wyfe, truely showen. ] before the naturall zeale of a Sister, where she before prosecuted, the reuenge of her Brothers death, shee now was an humble suter to the Kinge for her Husbands lyfe. The gracious Kinge, sought to appease her with good words,   [  The comon weale, is to be regarded before priuate [illeg.]our. ] but hee could not do her this priuate fauour, without iniurie vnto the publyke weale: for though (quoth he) your sute be iust, and the bounden dutie of a wife, yet I in fulfillyng the same should do iniustly, & (generally) iniure my Subiects: and therfore, good Gentlewoman, haue patience, and no doubt vertue in the ende will giue you power ouer all your afflictions. There was no remedie, Cassandra must departe, out of hope, to obtayne her sute. But as the experience, is in dayly vse, the dooinges of Princes post through the world on PEGASVS backe:   [  Sine bonum, sine malum, Fama est. ] And as theyr actions are good or badde, so is their fame. With the lyke speede, the Kynges Iustice, and PROMOS execution was spred abroad: and by the songe of a Clowne, was blowen into Andrugioes eares, who tyll then lyued lyke an Outlawe in the Desart wooddes. But vpon these Newes, couertly,   [  Good motions proceede fro the soule and euyll fro the flesh. ] in the Habyt of an Hermyt, by the Diuine motion of the sowle, who directes vs in thinges that be good, and the Flesshe in Actions of euyll, Andrugio, goes to see the Death of his Capitall enemie: But on the other parte, regardyng the sorrow of his Sister, he wisshed him lyfe, as a friende. To conclude, as well to geue terrour to the lewde, as comfort to his good Subiectes, the Kyng (personallie) came to see the execution of Promos, : who, garded with Officers, and strengthened with the comfortable perswasions of his Ghostly Fathers: Among whom, Andrugio was, meekely offered his lyfe, as a satisfaction for his offences, which were many more,   [  A gratefull parte. ] then the Lawe tooke knowledge of: And yet, to say the trueth, suche was his Repentance, as the multitude did both forgeue and pittie him: yea, the King wondred that his lyfe was gouerned with no more vertue, consideryng the grace he showed at his death. Andrugio, behouldyng this ruethfull Spectackle, was so ouercome with loue towardes his Sister, as to giue her comfort, he franckly consented anew to emperill his own life: And followinge this Resolution, in his Hermyts weede, vpon his knees, he humblye desired the Kinge to giue hym leaue to speake. The Kyng (gratiously) graunted hym Audience. Whervpon (quoth he) regarded Soueraigne, if Lawe may (possibly be satisfied: Promos true Repentance, meritteth pardon. Good Father (quoth the King) he can not liue, and the Lawe satisfied, vnlesse (by Miracle) Andrugio be reuiued.   [  Murther asketh death, and no other Satisfaction. ] Then (quoth the Hermyt, if Andrugio lyue, the Law is satisfied, and Promos discharged. I (quoth the King,) if your Praier can reuiue the one, my mercie shall acquite the other. I humbly thanke your Maiestie (quoth Andrugio ) and discoueryng himselfe, shewed the Prouidence of God and the meane of his escape: and tendrynge his Sisters comfort, aboue his owne safetie, hee prostrated him selfe at his Maiesties Feete: humblye to obay the sentence of his pleasure. The Kinge vppon the reporte of this straunge Aduenture: after good deliberation, pardoned Promos , houldyng an opinyon, that it was more benefitiall for the Citezens, to be ruled by their olde euell gouernour, new refourmed, then to aduenture vppon an newe, whose behauiours were vnknowne:   [  Of two, the least euill is least daungerous. ] And to perfect Cassandras ioye, he pardoned her Brother Andrugio , with condition, that he should marrie Polina . Thus, from betweene ye teethe of daunger, euery partie was preserued, and in the ende establyshed in their hartes dessre. Madam (quoth Soranso ) your good conclusion,   [  Ruthfull tales, raiseth remorce in the hearers. ] hath likewise preserued vs from a great daunger: for had you ended with the sorrow you began, wee had beene all like to haue bene drowned in teares. Indeede (quoth Katharina Trista ) you men had, had cause sufficient of sorrowe, by hearing your kynde reproched with such monstrous euils:   [  By example of euill, the euill are feared. ] and we women free passage to lament, in behoulding none but crosse fortunes to succeede the good indeuours of a vertuous Ladie. It is true (quoth Fabritio ) but to participate of their ioye,   [  By example of the good, the good are strengthned. ] wee men haue learned out of Promos example of euil, for feare of his likelie punishment of euil, to doo well: and you Women, by example of Polinas vice, and Cassandras vertue, are both warned and incouraged to weldooing. Indeede (quoth Queene Aurelia , there are many Morall precepts in either Historie,   [  Good order is to bee kept among such as haue bene late sick. ] to be considered: whiche I hope the company haue so regarded, as there needeth no repetition. And further, because I will not be to bould of the victorie, ouer my late distemperature: we will heare ende: And therwith she rose, & retired into her Chamber: with charge that the company should attende her, in the same place, vntil Supper, who obaying, intertained time, euery one with their speciall fancy. Supper, as well on the Gentlewomens parte, as of the Gentlemens. Insomuch as presumyng vpon this Daies honour (when the Table was readie to be taken away.) Aluisa vechio, tooke vpon her, to mayntaine a woman, to be a creature euery way, as execellent and perfecte as Man    [  Comparison breedeth contention. ] . For naturall shape (quoth she) they are more beautifull, of a better temperature, and complection then men. In valiaunt exploytes, what difference was there betweene Semiramis and her Husbande Ninus? betweene the Amazon women and Alexender . For constantnesse of mind, did not Loadice imbrace deathe, with lesse feare,   [  Excellent vertues in women. ] then Mithridates her Husband, Asdruballes Wife, then Asdrubal himselfe. And what man hath kept a constant resolution of death, so long as Lucretia . In Morall vertues, you men that reade Histories and Cronicles of all ages, shall finde Women, renowmed for learnyng, Gouernment, and pollycie. In Mecanycall Artes, there are Women, lykewise experienced. In the vertue of Deuining, what man hath come neare the Sibels ? To bee shorte, what Man hath bene so perfect in any vertue: but Histories make mention of a woman as perfect? Yea (quoth Dondolo ) but there be so few of these women, as an easy wit may remember them.   [  Cauelers neuer answere directly. ] But it will cumber your Tong to report them (quoth Katharina Trista . The other Gentlemen although they were willinge to giue place vnto the Gentlewome in small matters,   [  A disgrace in honour, a Gentleman may not beare with. ] yet this comparison of equal soueraignty, netteled them a lytil. In as much, as Soranso aunswered. Madam Aluisa , you haue made a bould comparison, and but a bare proofe: Where you vaunte, to be more excellent in shape, and more delicate in substaunce then men. It is an ouer ruled question, that Women receiue perfection by men, & men imperfection by Women: then by how much the vertue is of more emprise,   [ Aristotles probleames. ] that is simplye of it selfe, then that which is compounde of an other: by so farre wee exceede you in this perfection. Your honour of valyantnes, died with your examples, and although there hath bene Women learned, and experienced in Mecanicall craftes,   [ Extraordinarie thinges, are not to be copared with ordinarie. ] yet to heare a Woman plead at the Barre, preache in a Pulpit, or to see her build a House, is a wonder and no example in vse. How shorte your deuinyng Sybels , come of the credit, of the Prophets in the olde Testament, is no question disputable: For your constancie at deathe,   [  Life is pretious. ] you knowe not how precious lyfe is, which maketh you rash and not constant: and in trueth, what you haue frowardely determined, you will not bee forbidden. As shee that had her Tongue cut, for callyng of her Husband Theefe, woulde yet notwithstandinge, make the signe of the Gallowse. Well sir (quoth Queene Aurelia ) Epicarias obstynacy,   [  Epicaria, in the trembling passage of death, was constant. ] who endured to bee rent in peeces, before shee woulde confesse the conspyracie agaynst NERO , would haue ben holde for a Uertue of staiednesse in a man. And what say you of Leena , that byt off her tonge, and spit it in the Tirant Hippias face,  1 because she would not bewraye a conspiracy against him. Madame (with your fauour, quoth the Doctor) had she not had this foresight, it had ben lyke the Athenians shuld haue bene driuen to haue made a brasen Bell, as a Monument of her talke:   [  An enuious Suggestion. ] rather then a tongueles Lionnesse, as they did in honour of her silence, for had she not mistrusted her imperfection, she would neuer haue committed that tirannie vpon her selfe. Had her tongue beene venomed with your mallice, it is like (quoth Queene Aurelia ) that the Athenians had veryfied your slaunderous opinion: herewith she looked askanse, vpon her fauoured seruaunts, as who would saye. I check the omission of your dutie, in not defending of my right . Upon which warning, and espetially,   [  A man may praise a Woman without reproching a man. ] for the excellencie of this sexe, quoth Ismarito , a man may doo iustice vnto an other, without iniurie to himselfe: and sure without the reproche of men, a man may commend the excellencie of Women: in whose behalfe (although I wyll not condemne Sir Soransos reasons, yet in my opinion, he erred in the first Article, where he toucheth the perfection of Men, and the imperfection of Women: for neither of themselues are perfect, nor may haue essentiall substauce without the other: [  Chaste talk, ought espetially to be vsed in the presence of VVomen. Aris. Prob. ] But to dispute of this secret in nature at large, were vnpleasing to their chaste eares, and too breefely to misticall for theyr vnderstandings. But who so is so curious in searche, let him reade the Philosophers Probleames, with an vnpartiall iudgement, and he shall finde them in substaunce euery way as perfect as man. And in the opinion of the eye, of all the sences, who is the moste perfect Iudge, they farre excell man in purenes of complection: Where exception is taken to the few in number, of singulerly well qualyted Women,   [  The quallity and not the quantity commends. ] I affirme that it is not the quantity, but the quallity that commends: a little Salte, relisheth more then a great deale of Sugar. Iudeth with her owne hands, atchieued a more honourable conquest, then all the Cilisions besides. Alexandra , the wife of Alexander , King of the Iewes , (when the vnciuill multitude, were ready for his tiranie) to make the intrailes of Dogges, a Sepulture for his dead body: yea and to be further auenged, to murther his two Sonnes: by her sweete behauiour, so mollified theyr cruell hearts, as losing theyr resolutions, they gaue her husband an honourable buriall, and prostrated themselues, at her Childrens feete: which pacification, the strength nor wisdom of her counsel could not obtaine. By what instrument did God first showe the vigor of his vengeaunce? by   [  Eaue. ] a Woman. And by what instrument did he showe the vertue of his mercie? by a Woman.   [  Our Lady. ] Soueraigne Vertue is Feminine , and (I blush to tell it,) Yrkesome Vice is Masculine . The Ladies laughed out right, to heer Ismaritos difference. But Soranso halfe angrie, aunswered, that if Ismaritos countrimen, were of his minde, they might be ashamed that they were so effeminate. Pardon me, quoth Ismarito , it is theyr commendation to yeelde vnto Women, [  Where an iniurie in words, may be reuenged in words, a Gentleman is not boud to his sword ] and to conquer Men. Tush, tush (quoth Pergetto ) to nip himself by the nose, Ismarito is to be pardoned: for his Captaine S. George , is shackled in a Womans Garter. It is true (quoth Ismarito ) but thus fettered, he hath many times chased S. Michael to his Mounte. Fabritio , fearing that these crosses would turne to the Deuils blessing studyed how to accorde this contention, and with that intent,   [  Discreete standers by pacifieth contentions ] quoth he, Ismarito , you haue well deserued to kisse these Ladyes handes, for your honourable commendation of theyr sexe: But where you say Vertue is the Feminine , and Vice the Masculine , bothe Men and Women, are vnderstood in either. The old Diuines, tooke Vertue to be God, and Vice the Diuill,   [  Vertue and vice, bothe Feminine, and Masculine. ] and either to be bothe Feminine and Masculine. Orpheus sayde, that Iupiter and Pluto , were bothe Male and Female . It is also read in Scripture: That God fashioned bothe Man and Woman to his owne likenesse . Moreouer this worde Homo , signifieth bothe kindes: so that since Man and Woman, are not simply of themselues, but compounded one of an other, I blame this vnnaturall contention, for excellencie, for neither can obtaine Soueraigne victorie, without dooing iniurie vnto themselues:   [  Note. ] The head among some is taken for the Man, and the heart for the woman, (for bothe are of an indifferent gender) and all the other members indifferently at their commaundement. Queene Aurelia , with a smiling countenaunce, aunswered, that she was content, that a Man should gouerne as the head, & women direct as the heart, and because we will not doo iniurie, vnto our naturall vertue of Modesty, we will giue place to you, in contention for Souerainetyes,   [  Modesty, an naturall vertue in a Woman. ] and binde you to serue vs for our vertues and therewithall in rising, she broke of this controuersie. After Supper, there was a little time bestowed in the hearing of sweete Musique, but for that Queene Aurelias late distemprature, grew of ouer watching: the company this night, went vnto their lodging in a good howre. FINIS. Containing a breefe discourse, touching the excellencie of Man: and a large discouerie of the inconueniences of ouer lofty, and too base Loue: with other Morall notes, needefull to be regarded. daies early rising: who by nine of the Clock, entered the great Chamber, armed for any lawdable exercise. And after an accustomed duty of salutation discharged, euery man be thought himselfe of some pleasing matter, to entertaine the present time. Soranso and Ismarito were seuered from the rest of the company, vpon priuate discourse: which beeing ended, Soranso , casting his eye aside, beheld in the hangings, the picture of Ixion , heardled to his tormenting Wheele.    [  The Fable of Ixion. ] See yonder, quoth he, the worthy scourge of Ambition , and withall reported the Fable, of his presumptuous making of loue to Iuno . Naye quoth Ismarito, Ixion is rather the example of Vaine Glorie punished: for Iupiter , so well allowed of Ixions hie minde (in that he represented his Image) as he   [  To be proude in vertues, is commendable. ] raysed him from Earthe to Heauen, and because he should not perish in his affection, he satisfied his desire with the embracement of a counterfeit Iuno , and so sent him backe vnto the Earth: where vaine glorious Ixion Proclaymed, that he was the Minion of Iuno ,   [  The scorge of vaine glory. ] and had Acteoned Iupiter : for which arrogancie, Iupiter threw him to Hell, with this pictured vengeaunce. Questionlesse, quoth Soranso , this imagination of the Heathen Poet, could not but be the trauell of a Diuine spirit, it exposeth such needefull matter, for Christians to contemplate of. You neede not doubt of your opinion, quoth Ismarito ,   [  The soule traueleth to bring forth Diuine monuments in the heathen. ] for after God had created Adam after his owne Image, he scattered the seede of Adam vppon the face of the whole world, and where some euer the essentiall forme of Adam was, there was also the Image of God, which in the moste barberous and Heathen creature, laboureth to bring out, hye and excellent things. I beseeche you, quoth Soranso , to inlarge this discourse. I am not so simple to beleeue, that we are like the Image of God, in our outwarde shape: yet my knowledge is not perfect, in what vertues we resemble the Image of God. Referring you, for your better knowledge,   [  A discreete exordium, for yong men that argue. ] to grauer iudgements (quoth Ismarito ) I wyll onely to satisfye your request, say what I haue reade, and what in my oppynyon, standeth with reason. In our exterior body, to say we resemble God, were a grose ignoraunce:   [ The excellencie of ma through the vertue of the soule. ] but in that our soule is closed within our body, and giueth life, and mouing, to the whole body: it is no obsurdity to conclude the lesse within the greater, to showe how the soule resembleth God: who consisteth in a Trinity . Notwithstanding she is but one, yet she comprehendeth in her three dignities, to wit, Intendment, Wit , and Memorie .   [  Three dignities of the soule. ] And as the sonne, is ingendered of the Father, and the holy Ghost proceedeth from bothe: euen so Will is engendred of Intendment , and Memorie proceedeth from both: and as the three persons of the Trinitie , are but one God, so the three powers of the soule, are but one soule: and in that man is created in this sorte, according to the image of God, because he should resemble his creator in excellencie, he is formed straight and not curbed: to behould the earth, [  Man is formed straight, because he should behold heauen, and cotemplate one great matters. ] not thereby to shewe a dyfference betweene him and other brute Beastes, but only because he should raise his spirite, and heaue hys eyes to heauen, his originall, to contemplate of diuine and dureable thynges, and not of earthly and such as perysshe. And sure the monuments, that to this day renowne heathe Alexander, Iulius Cesar, Scipio, Haniball , and manye other stoute warriors, Plato, Pithagoras, Socrates, Solon , and many thousand graue Philosophers weare the exercyses of the soule, who in her function is alwaies ocoupied, to make me shine like Angels. And doubtles, the exploits of man, would be wonderful, & glorious, were not the passages of the three powers of the soule,   [  Three euils or defects of the body. ] Intendment, Will , & Memory stopped, with these three euils or defects of ye body. Ignorance of that which is good, Couetousnes, of that which is euill , and the Infirmitie, and langor of the body . These be the euilles, that eclipseth the excellencie of many who otherwise would appeare more glorious then the Sonne, Moone, Starres, and Chrstall Firmament, into whose motions, reuolutions, and influences, his knowledge foreseeth: or the earth with all her faire furniture which he gouerneth, and therfore he is called Microcosmos , for that in excellencie, he egalleth the beautie of the whole worlde. Sir quoth Soranso , you haue inchaunted my Eares with such a pleasing regarde, as if you were as tedious in discourse, as I would be attentiue in hearing, we should bothe lose our dinners, without any great repining: but in aduauntage I beseech you, what may be the remedy of these three euils, which thus obscure the excellencie of man. Three soueraigne remedyes quoth Ismarito , to witte Wisdome ,   [  Three remedies against the three euils of the body ] Vertue , and Necessitie , which to chase the other three euils, are thus ordered: Wisdome against Ignoraunce: Vertue against Vice , and Necessitie against Infirmitie. Wisdome is to be vnderstoode according to the condition of the things, wherein we be ignorant. Vertue is an habit of the soule, which without great difficultie cannot be shaken out of his place and subiect: By Necessitie , absolutely is intended, a supply against those wants,   [  The originall of all Artes and Sciences. ] with which Infirmitie hath charged vs, as if we be lame, to haue Horse to ride: if we be sycke to haue medicine: if our bodyes be weake, to haue nourishing meates, &c. And by these three remedyes, all Artes and Disciplines haue beene inuented, to acquire Wisdome :   [  Theorique. ] Theorique , which is contemplatiue and consists in these three parts, Theologie, Phisick , and Mathematique , was found,   [  Practise. ] for Vertue. Practise , which is actiue, and deuided, into Solitarie Priuate and Publike , was put in vse. And for Necessitie ; all Mecanicall craftes were inuented.   [  Mecanicall craftes. ] These three vertues if we imbrace them, will chase the other three euilles bothe out of our body, soule, and remembrance. You haue giuen me a short sweete reason quoth Soranso . And a longe remembrance of my weake vnderstanding quoth Ismarito : but for that I haue made this Sermon, vppon your importunity, your curtesy I hope will pardon me, as well as your wisdome will correct my errours. I had thought Ceremonies had beene in disgrace,   [  Curtesie is commendable, but superfluous fauours of flatterrie. ] among you Englishmen , quoth Soranso , but I finde you superstitious in curtesie, and therefore will take no example by you: but let it suffise, I am your freend, and wyll deserue this fauour, in any resonable seruice. By this time, Dinner was ready to be set vpon the boarde, and Queene Aurelia came againe vnto the open viewe, whose presence was as welcome vnto the generall company, as the cleare Sunne (after roughe stormes) to the wether- weried Sayler. After she had acquited the courteous salutations of the whole troupe, she fyrste toke her place, and then the rest as they pleased, as were accustomed. At this Dinner there passed much pleasaunt Table talke, impertinent for this report: which beeing doone, at the accustomed howre, Queene Aurelia sent for the chosen company, who placed in the drawing Chamber: the Eunuck knowing his charge, tuned his Lute, and songe this following Sonet. By my consent, shall to a Nettle smell: Or though fainte heart, who dooth a Ladie lose, A droyle I wishe, or to leade Apes in Hell. On Thornes, no Grapes, but sowre Slowes do growe So from base loue, a base delight dooth flowe. Then minde crowne thou, my thoughts aboue the skie, For easie gaynde, the Conquest is not sweete: My fancie swift, with Icarus wings dooth flye. Yet fastined so, as fyre and Froste may meete. For pleas'd am I, if hope returne but this: Grace is obtaynde, thy Mistrisse hand to kisse. A Grace indeede, far passing all the ioye, Of egall loue, that offereth wish in wyll: For though her scorne, and light regard annoy, Dispaire of grace, my fancie can not kill. For why this ioye, all passions sets in rest: I dayly see, my Mistresse in my breast. Who so inuented this sonet [quoth] Queene Aurelia , deserueth to be well fauoured of his Mistresse, in that he kept her so carefully in his bosome. Nay [quoth] Dondolo , if his eyes were so subtyll, as absent, he could see her behauior, his affection were more daungerous then his seruice necessarie. We geue you to know ([quoth] Isabella ) that we waye not though our husbandes, a hundred myles of, knowe our behauiours at home. I thinke so quoth the plaine Doctor, for so farre off they may (sighe at their one mischauce, but) not chaste your amisse. Perchaunce they should not be charged with such iniurie, as this company should be (quoth Maria Belochy ) if wee would offer to aunswer your enuious sugiestions. Laides I speake not with intent ([quoth] Soranso ) to make a question of your behauiors, but admit you of all creatures the most perfect: yet for that you haue motions, as well bad, as good, you maye many tymes make showe of euill, and yet not doo amysse, which if your husbandes be so quicke sighted, as to perceiue, they will iudge by their owne eyes, and not by your hartes, and so from shaddowes may growe euill effectes. If there sight be so quick, [quoth] Franceschina Santa , then If their sight be so quick (quoth Franceschina Sancta ) then, though by a negligent trespasse, their wiues sometime giue them cause to sigh, with a number of louing vsadges, they will giue them daylye occasion of reioysinge. I graunt as muche (quoth Soranso ) but this will follow,   [  The euyll of Ielousie. ] the Husband will turne his owne mistruste, to hys Wiues sorrow, and receaue her good vsage to his owne pryuate comfort. Indeede (quoth Aluisa Vechio ) the loue of a ielous husband, is sawced with such frowarde motions, as I had rather be matched with him, that regardeth mee not at al, then with him that loueth mee too muche: for of the one, though I am not beloued, yet I shall not be much crossed: of the other, I being too much beloued, I shall neuer be in quiet. I am not of your mynde (quoth Helena Dulce ) I had rather haue my Husbande ielous, then carelesse:   [  Harde is the difference, betweene a carelesse and a ielous Husbande. ] for being carelesse, no good vsage will reconcile him: and being Ielous, the Wife may studie out how to please him. Yea, but (quoth Katharina Trista ) Men are so easye conceited, that if they perceiue a woman studdieth how to please them, they straight waies, imagine, she will lykewise studdie how to deceiue them: and therefore, God sheelde mee from a Ielous Housbande. I haue heard, the whightstreaked Carnation Giliflower , was the Metamorphos of a Faire Gentlewoman, beheaded by her husband, vpon this Ielous thought, that his wife beinge so faire, could not but be beloued of the Gods,  2 although hee had no cause to suspect men. And where haue yee a larger Example of Loue, then the Aduenture of Orpheus , who by extreame sorrow and sute, sent her thither againe. Doctor Mossenigo was smyling out a scoffe,   [  Preuent a Scoffer, and he becometh a Sotte. ] vpon this tale, which Queene Aurelia intercepted, by ending of the Gentlewomens contention. By your talke of Hell (quoth she) I see we are out of the way to Platoes Parradice: and therfore, good, we tourne backe agayne. Indeede Madame (quoth Fabritio ,) if we trauell styll, to choose the leaste of Euylles, it wyll be longe before we come to the Fountayne of Goodnesse. Me thinkes (quoth Isabella ,) the Sonet, which mooued the late Question, directes a fayre way to happinesse in Mariage: for it commendeth loftie Loue: And if, accordyng to the oulde Prouerbe: The best, is best cheape : this Aduenture,   [  A Commendatio of lofty Loue. ] geueth Hope, and promiseth good Fortune. It is true (quoth Soranso ,) & I dare vndertake to approoue it, the happiest estate in Mariage. Dondolo , because he would not be disgraced, by mariyng a Burgoys fayre Daughter of Rauenna , offered to prooue the contrarie. Queene Aurelia , licensed them to shew their reasons. Whervpon, quoth Soranso : to geue great Ladies and Gentlewomen of calling, their true right and honor, who lightly, marry not their Inferiours in reputation, but for some especiall Uertue, that doth commende their choice, and cleareth the Bleamish of their Husbandes basenes? I must confesse, that he which rayseth his thought so hye, vndertaketh (no doubt) a tedious sute: his delayes wyll be greeuous, and his Solliciters wyll be well rewarded, in what sort so euer he be regarded. But what of this? Quo quid difficilius, eo pulchrius : Perryll maketh honor perfect: the styngyng of the Bee, mendes the sweetenes of Honie: Roses best refresheth our Sences, when we prick our handes to reache them: He that crackes the Nut, thinkes the Kernell sweetest. The reason is, not for that the goodnesse of a thing,   [  The euyll of a thyng, commendeth the goodnesse, ] is the better, for the euil thervnto belonging: but, for that the remebrance of ye euyl, maketh vs holde the good in more reputation: especially, in loue. The Affection, whiche is forced with teares, wonne with sighes, gaind with expence, and compassed with sorow, is held most pleasant, most perfect & of longest continuance. Againe, easie gotten good wyll, becometh in a while lothsome: the cause is, as I coceiue, for yt the pleasure was neuer seasoned wt paine. Once, a man, in louing his better, to encrease his passion, shal lack no occasion, both to seeke, sue, sigh & serue: & yet, to feede his hope, he shal want, neyther faire lookes, good wordes, nor possybilytie of fauour. For, for to obtain a great Ladie, acquireth many circumstaunces, not for that shee is precise to loue, but for that shee is wise, (or woulde bee so thought) in her proceedinges. But whether she loue or no: Ouid saith, there is no woman, but wil indure the demaund: she is contented with seruice to be courted: & in recopence,   [  Loue spareth no degree. ] rewardeth with good countenance. But, which most sustaineth hope, the exaple is in cotinual vse: that loue spareth no degree, transgresseth euery law, & bringeth ye mightiest in bodage to the meanest. King Cofetua , the Affrican , became enamoured of a Begger: faire Venus , espoused yll fauoured Vulcan: Pigmalion doted vpon an Image: Narcissus was drowned in imbrasing his owne shadow: & mightie Ioue , many times, cast aside his diuinitie, to dallie with simple country trulles: then, why shuld the affected (how bace so euer his estate be) dispaire to attempt a great Ladie, whe his warrant is signed with so large Aucthoryties? But whether he speede or faile: be accepted or reiected: well entertained, or yll intreated: the ymagination, that time wil inuest his desire wt delight, is to the Affected, a Paradice,   [  Hope to compasse great matters comforteth more then the possession of tryfles. ] farre exellying the possession of equall loue: But if in the end, her affection, or his good fortune, concludeth his wish in desire: her loue, whiche can not choose but be great: in that she marieth beneth her callyng: And her Abylytie, which allured at the first, with his inhabylytie: to realysh both, can not but make the Husbande fortunate, and the Wife well pleased: for that in recompence of this aduancement, she may presume, somwhat, to rule her Heade: but, which most contents, she shal haue the satisfaction of her fancie a bed.   [ Reproofe of loftie Loue ] If a House, were as soone bilded, as the Plot is drawn (quoth Dondolo ) Shepherds wold disdaine to liue in Cottages: eue so, if euery ma could as soone copasse a Lady for himselfe, as he can report the fortune of other: there must be an Act to make Ladies, or Lords must be glad of mean Women. But admit, by the example of other mens Aduauncements, that the meanest may be raised, by the yeelding fancye of the mightie: I prophesie that such an vpstarte, had more neede of ten Eyes, to warde the mallice of his Wiues kindred, then one tongue to moue her to kindnesse. A woman cannot myslike affectionated profers, because they proceede of loue: But her kindred disdaineth his attempte, for that the conclusion, tendeth both to their and her dishonour:   [  One kinsman hath an Interest in others honor. ] A woman seeing her seruaunts passions, cannot but sustaine him with pittie, her Kindred seeinge him in good way to bee beloued, will lye in waite for his lyfe: For though she may dispose of her affection, her kindred hath an interrest in her honour, which if she consent to staine, or deminishe, shee dooth iniurie to her whole house. The Cardinal of Aragon ,   [  An inhumain parte. ] aduenged the base choice of his Sister, the Duchesse of Malfy , with the death of her selfe, her Children, and her Husband: and alleadged in defence, that he had done no iniurie to Nature, but purged his House of dishonour: for Nature (quoth he) is perfect, and who blemisheth her is a monster in Nature, whose head, without wrong to Nature may be cut off. Yea (quoth Soranso ) but,   [  Defence. &c. ] this Cardinall, for all his habit, and glose of Iustice, is for this Act, so often regestred for a Tirant, as I feare mee he will neuer come among ye nuber of Saints, But the example of these Mariages are vsuall, and such ensuing vengeaunce is but rare, and besides her espetiall contentment,   [  Reproofe, &c. ] a woman looseth none of her general titles of dignitie by matching wt her inferior. In deede (quoth Dondolo ) in common curtesie she enioyeth   [  A woma that abaseth her selfe in Mariage, in Law loseth her reputation, but not in curtesie. ] them, but in the strickt construction of the Law, she is degraded. And by this meane is bounde to intertaine the meaner, with familyaritie, least, they (being prowde, or reputing her scornfully) doo crosse her ouer the thumbes with ye follyes of her fancy. But admit ye meane seruant, marrie his Mistresse, and escapeth the mallice of her friendes: which successe, one amonge tenne suche Suters hardly attaineth. Let him yeelde to pay this rent for his good fortune: To suffer his Wife, to rule, to direct, determynations. And where shee ordereth: The vncontrouled Wife, desireth to be serued with pompe, and to be set foorth with pride: whiche the ruling Husband would represse, as wel for sauing his wiues honour, as for sparing his owne pursse. The vncontrouled wife desireth to walke at lybertie, and to be visited of many: of which the ruling Husbande, woulde barre her: as well to preserue his mynde from mistruste, as to keepe his Chimney from being fyred. The vncontrouled wife disdayneth the Countrie and desireth the Citie: which the rulyng Husband would mislyke, for that in the Countrie, the exercise of huswiuerie inlargeth his Wiues estimation, and in the Cittie, Idlenesse hazardeth her reputation. The vncontrouled Wife, desireth without checke to pratle, and without discreation to gouerne: which the rulyng Husbande in no wise would allowe, for that manye wordes is a bleamish to his wiues modestie, and the rule of his Wife, is warrant sufficient, for the wise to ouer rule him for a Woodcocke. Many other vanities, follow the desires of Women: which a man thus aduaunst, must forbeare to chasten, least hee expose himselfe to a thousande daungers: for the wife taking pepper in the nose, will suffer him, (yea perchaunce, agree to make him) a pray, to the displeasure of his enemies: I meane her able Friendes and kindred: which bondage is not within the Paradice, Plato speaketh off: For according to the opinion of sundrie Philosophers , as Nature will not be controuled, for that she createth: as Fortune is won with no praiers, because shee is blinde, and shooteth at aduenture: no more dooth Marriage alow of inequallitie, because her will is to deuide her benyfites, and blessing among the married with indifferencie. To this ende Marriage is lykened to Sienes grafted in a stocke of contrarie qualitie: for as by groweth and good order, they both become of one nature, euen so, man and woman vnited in this honourable estate,   [  Iudgement in repoof of lofty loue. ] with good vsage, become of one disposition. Againe, as Sienes thus grafted without speciall Husbandrie, while they bee tender, come to no proofe: euen so man and woman, thus ioyned in Matrimonie: vnlesse in the prime of their Mariage, with equall care, they loue and cherrish one an other, in the waine of their yeares, the sweete Fruites of wedlocke, will be blasted with repentaunce. Segnior Fabritio , to conclude Don Dolos opinion, with his owne Iudgement, saide in trueth, that Marriage coulde not away with such seruitude: as the Husband, who is wise and the cheefe, shoulde obay the wife, who in common construction, is simple, weake and the inferiour. And where a Rich woman (as Don Dolo hath said) Marieth her poore Seruant, because she is the cause of his aduancement, she will looke to gouerne: which if she doo, her indiscression, will moue others to speake, and her Husband to sorrow: and if he challenge the preuiledge of a husband to direct, hee shall bee bounde to a lyfe more bitter then Death. Not, but yt in respect of his former estate, he may endure these crossinges of his wife, but because, as hee is growne in estimation: so is hee growne in hautinesse of mynd, and can now wurse brooke an vnkinde word, then in times past, an iniurious deede. And therefore in Don Dolos behalfe, I doo iudge Soranso to be in an errour. I wil not dispute, against the Authoritie of your iudgmet ([quoth] Soranso ) but at aduenture if yonger Brethre er in   [  Men must haue regarde how they blame, least they byte themselues. ] Mariage , God send the to stumble vpo no worser fortune. Queene Aurelia , who regarded, that Dondolo was somewhat to lauish, in painting out, of the natural desires of a woman, knew as well, how to set foorth his follyes and ouersight: and therefore to take a modest reuenge ([quoth] shee.) If happinesse in Mariage consisteth so much in the Lorldly rule of the Husbande, then where a man maryeth his inferriour in reputation, there is a lykelyhood of good agreement: Wherfore Segnior Dondolo , because I think you married your wife, with the same Iudgement, with which you manyfested the inconueniences of loftye Loue: I beseeche you, show vs the blessinges of this inferiour choyce. Soranso , and the rest began to smyle, to heare this commaundement: for well they knew Dondolo , was intrapt with a slauder of his owne reputatito: but Dondolo , although, he were a litle gauled, set a reasonable florish, vpon his bace fancie: and therefore ([quoth] he) as it is alreadie adiudged, if a man marrie aboue his callyng,   [  Defence of bace loue. ] he must beare with his Wife in folly, as much as shee was blynded in fancying of him: which bondage, Mariage can hardly endure: Then if hee matche with his inferiour, if contraries haue contrarie qualyties, per consequence : she will be as lowly, as the other is loftie: as pacient, as the other is prowde: & as dutiful, as ye other is disdainfull: if the other prodigally spend, because her portion is large, she wil with huswiuerie spare, because her substauce was small: If the other presume, because of her Gentrie, shee will seeke reputation, with her good coditions: And if the other bolster her faults, with the countenaunce of her able Friendes, she dooing amisse, will crie her Husbande mercie,   [  A riche Dowrie with a woman. ] because she lackes succourers, to sustaine her euill: a course, as Plato sayeth, that maketh the dowrie of the poore virgin of greater vallue then the possessions of a riche Ladie. You are nothing deceiued in the course (quoth Faliero )   [  Reproofe. &c. ] but much mistaken in the creature. As touching your Contraries, I mislike your Consequent: For Fyre and Water haue contrarye woorkynge, and vnorderlye vsed, both hurtfull, Prodigallytie, and Coueitusnesse, are contraries, & neither necessarie: euen so, ye courtly dame, & the Countrey Droyle, as they contrary, in callyng, so are they contrary in conditions: and so they may be matched, neither profitable. A Diamond is blemisht, by the settyng in Brasse, and a Flynt, not the beautyfuller, for beynge garnishte with Gold: euen so, the honour of a woman, is Eclipst, in matchyng with her Seruaunt, her slaue, or her Inferiour: for that Straungers wyll valewe her by her Fortune, although her haughtie nature, wyll not lose the name of her reputation: Neither is the estimation of a Kitchynstuffe inlarged, by marriyng with a Courtier: for that the Best wyll disdayne her Basenes, not so much for her byrth, as her bryngynge vp: Yet, presumyng on her Husbandes callyng: in Pryde, she wyll pearch with the hyest: whiche Soueraigntie,   [  Kytte wyll to kynde. ] in the one, & saucines in the other, separats pleasantnesse from their Husbandes, and quietnesse, both from themselues and their Houshouldes: where, as if the Gentlewoman, marrie with a Gentleman, and a Kitchin stuffe with a Cooke: the one with duetifull regarde of her Husband, may hold her reputation, and the other shal not be driuen, to dissemble with their kinde. Well, let this suffice, to refell their Suggestions, that thinke pleasantly to spende their dayes, by marrying eyther their better or inferiour. Now, touchynge the generall disposition, of suche wemen, as from the Cart, are raysed vnto this account: they will vse the better sorte with straingenesse, because they lacke the order of honest curtesie to entertain the, & with the basest wyl be famyliar, because the rudenes of the one answereth the ignorance of the other: So that, it is more requisite for him that is thus married, to watche his wyues goyng into the Stable, for feare of his Horsekeeper, then in her Parlour, to eye her behauiour, in entertayning the Gallant. Examine Kyng Astolphus , what constancie he found in his three halpenie Iuell, whome he had tourned out of Sheepes Russet, into Cloth of Siluer: In such honours, had no otherwise altered her manners, but that she thought the Lyppes of a Captaine was as sweete as a Kings, and therfore in all her brauerie, she fell to her kinde.  3 If this suffice not, heare the vsage of Bianca Maria , Daughter and onely Heire of Giaccomo Scapardon, a notable Userer of Baetta, Biancas beautie, made her sufficiently knowne, but her Fathers Bagges, made her wonderfully desiered: so that both ioyned together, aduaunst her, from a Shop Maide, firste, to be the wife of Vicount Hermes : after whose death, clyming vp to further honor, and declyning in honestie, she espoused the Counte of Zelande . Long after the seconde Mariage, shee dallyed not with her dispositio, which was rather in an open Shop, to bee courted with men, then in a secreat Chamber to be accompanied with wayting women: so that following her vnmodest fancy, with a few Prentices, she fled from her Husband to Padua , where she set vp for her selfe: and thus she vnworthely raised to bee a Countesse , wickedly, and wilfully fel to be a Courtisan . Andrea Zeno , a Gentleman of Vennice , was as slutishly serued with via a Cookes Daughter, who vpon her Mariadge day, made an easye way for her Husband, with no better man, then a Carpenter. If you coueit more Authorities, to approue so common a mischiefe read Ouid Metamorphosis in Latine, Segnior Lodouicus Regester, in Italian. Amadis de Gaule , in French , and the Pallace of pleasure , in English ,   [ Aucthoryties for amorous Histories. ] where you shall finde store of Histories to the like purpose. Sir (quoth Dondolo ) without offence, either to your person or your proofes (for that the one I loue, and the other I allowe) to confirme my oppinion I can likewise,   [  Defence. ] summon women as base as these in birthe, and as hie as these in fortune, which with their good behauiours, gaue a grace to their reputacion. Chaste Epethia , the welbeloued wife of Hanno Prince of Carthage, was a Sailers daughter. The vertuous Virginia, espoused to Sextillius a worthie Senator of Rome , was a Laundresse. Both these were beautified with such singuler vertues, as while they lyued, their honest lyues instructed the greatest Lady, in poincts of honor: & being ded, the remebrance of their worthinesse is a special comedation to ye whole sexe of weme. Sir (quoth Faliero ) as the Prouerb goeth: One or two Swallowes ,   [ Reproofe. &c ] prooues not Sumer : two or three, may thriue by Dice, yet is dicyng yl Husbandrie: because for the inrichyng of a few, it beggereth many: so, though two or three worthy Parsonages were wel wiued out of worthles parentages: a thousand, following the same course, haue had a contrary fortune: & wher the knowledge of euil, is more then the possibility of good: vertue, warrants not the venter: In warre, the miraculous escape of two or three rash persons, is no safecundit, for euery ma to ron vpo ye pikes: yet I graunt yt in war, desperate men are nedeful, for the safetie of the discreate, & so are homely women, necessarie for their seruice: but if you will vse either to your benefit, incourage ye one with gret pay, & the other wt good wages: for if you commit a charge to a harebraine Souldior his timeritie in one houre, wil hinder more, the his yeres hazard did further. And as I haue said, if you make of your Kitchen maid, a companion, her pride in one dayes libertie wil anoy more, then her seauen yeres loue wil cofort Seeing the company begin to smyle, I am satisfied quoth Dondolo . But how? quoth Aluisa Vechio? doe you repent you of of your bargaine, or disalow of Falieros proofes? Neither [quoth] Dondolo : For in general choice, this course is out of the way, to Platos Paradice : but for that my especial Fortune is good, I am pleased. Yea, [quoth] Soranso , or if ye contrary had happened, this might haue comforted you,   [  A confession is a prety Iudgement. ] yt your wife should not haue been ye only blamed woma in the Parish, nor you ye sole vnfortunate man. Wel, [quoth] Fabritio , and Isabella : There needes no further iudgement in this Question, then Dondolos confession and his yealding, to Falieros proofes. We haue in this exercise taken three sundrie wayes, (quoth Queene Aurelia ) and yet neuer a one the right way to our Paradice: and nowe it is too late to traiuel any further. Therefore we will refreash our spirites with a little Musicke, and so adiourne our further controueruersies vntill too Morowe: but as the Eunuke was a tuning his voyce, to haue fulfilled his Ladies commaundement, Knowledge was giuen of certaine honourable Personages ariual: by occasion wherof, the company left their determination to furnish the great Chamber. Theame, to present some pastime in action, the fift night, after Supper. By that time, Supper was done, certayne Comedians of Rauenna , presented their seruice to Segnior Philoxenus , & his honourable companie, who are not tide to a written deuice, as our English Players are, but hauing certayne groundes or principles of their owne, will, Extempore , make a pleasannt showe of other mens fantasies: So that to try the quicknes of the Gentlemen, and Gentlewomens wittes, to giue the Comedians a Theame, Segnior Philoxenus , demaunded the meaning of certaine Questions. Segnior Soranso , quoth he: What passion is that, that tormenteth a man most, To thinke of a Womans Inconstancie , [quoth] Soranso : which greeueth euery man, and cannot be subdued by women themselues. Madame Aurelia , ([quoth] Philoxenus :) What thing is that, which most delighteth, and most deceiueth a Woma? A mans dissimulation , ([quoth] Queene Aurelia :   [  2\. Dissimulation. ] ) Which hath such a sweete passage, through his Tongue, as it delighteth like the Sirens Songes , and yet turneth to as deceitefull a conclusion, as the Crocadiles Teares . This yet, was but quid pro quo : so that neither one parte, nor the other was displeased. The modest laughter being ceased, Segnior Philoxenus demaunded of Ismarito , what was the cause of most Deuotion ? and yet the greatest replenisher of Hell. Ignoraunce [[quoth] Soranso ] whiche causeth men to worship   [  3\. Ignorance. ] Stones, and dishonour God. Madam Maria , what is that (quoth Segnior Philoxenus ) yt of men is least esteemed, and of God most regarded? Chastitie [[quoth] Maria Belochy ] whiche is precious before   [  4\. Chastytie. ] God, and a laughing stock among men. Doctor Mossenigo [[quoth] Segnior Philoxenus ] amonge men who is the most cruell? A Dycer [[quoth] the Doctor ] for he teareth God in peeces.   [  5\. A Dicer. ] This answer, was both true, and moued newe laughter: Although it were propounded to discouer the nature of the Enuious ,   [  6\. Enuie. ] who murthereth the lyuing, and the fame of the dead. Madam Lucia [[quoth] Segnior Philoxenus ] wherein doth a man please a woman best, and displease himselfe most? The modest Gentlewoman began to blush, and with great difficultie resolued this Question. In the end, by the tongue of Alvisa Vechio (quoth she) In giuing of her,   [ 7\. Will. ] her Wyll . It is true (quoth the Doctor) for her delight is to gouerne, wherin her discretion, giueth others cause to laugh, and her Husband to hang the Lyp. Segnior Dondolo [[quoth] Segnior Philoxenus ] what is the greatest freende to men at libertie, and the most enimie to such as are condemned? Hope [[quoth] Dondolo ,   [  8\. Hope. ] ] whiche incourageth men at lybertie, to attempt great matters, and maketh such as are condemned, vnprepared for death. Madam Helena [[quoth] Segnior Philoxenus ] what is that which woundeth the hart, & yet is worshipped of the eye? Beautie (quoth Helena Dulce ) for it pleaseth a mans eye,   [  9\. Beautie. ] and pearceth his hart. Segnior Bergetto , ([quoth] Segnior Philoxenus ) What is that which oweth most and payeth least, and of all euils is the worst. Ingratitude : (quoth Bargetto :   [  10\. Ingratitude. ] ) For that Monster receiueth good turnes, and payeth vengeance. Madame Franceschina , (quoth Segnior Phyloxenus :) What is that, whiche in louynge too muche, baneth with Hate? Ielousie : [[quoth] Franceschina Sancta :   [  11\. Ielosie. ] ] whiche, by ouermuche louyng, raiseth Suspition: Suspition mooueth Contention , and Contention tourneth to mortall hatred. Segnior Faliero : I demaunde [[quoth] Phyloxenus :] who he is, that profiteth his frendes, but by Death? is a Stewarde, for other men: & maketh his Account (only) with God? A Coueitous man [[quoth] Faliero :] who, whyle he lyueth, is enemie vnto hymself, and therfore, vnlykely,   [  12\. Couetousnesse. ] to be friende to others: also is but a Stewarde of the goods hee gathereth, for he spareth for others, and spendeth little or nothing vppon himselfe: and at the iudgement day, before God, must make account of all his deceit. Madam Katherina , quoth Segnior Philoxenus : what is that, which is couldest clad in Friese, and warmest attyred in pretious Stones? Pride , quoth Katherina Trista , which hath no grace,   [  13\. Pride. ] but in brauerie. Louely Guestes, quoth Segnior Philoxenus , you haue so liuely deuined my meaning in your sharpe answeres: as I expecte wonders, of your dayly disputation. Sir, quoth Fabritio , we hitherto, haue but exposed, and refelled errours. If you haue done so muche ([quoth] Philox .) you haue made a fayre passage for the glorie of Trueth , which by the refelling of Error , you shall finde: contrarie. A Diamond seemeth the fairer, for his foyle. Blacke best setteth foorth White: Good is most praysed in the reprehension of Euill: and Trueth is the hyest degree is renowned by the refelling of errour: and therfore follow your purpose, the conclusion, cannot, but bee profitable. Heere Segnior Philoxenus stopped his digression, and commaunded the Comedians, to bethinke themselues of some action, that should lyuelie expresse the nature of Inconstancie, Dissimulation, Ignoraunce , and the rest of the passions, before named: Which charge being giuen, while the Actors, were attiring themselues, for the stage, Queene Aurelia , and her Attendaunts, tooke their places, with such aduauntage, as euery Gentleman, had lyberty, to deuise with his Mistresse. After the Comedians had put themselues in order, they patched a Comedie together, and vnder the resited names, showed some matter of Morallytie, but a greate deale of mirth: who with their pastime, kept the companie vp so long, as drowsie sleepe, which delighteth in nothing but scilence, arrested ye greater part of them, and caried them close prisoners, vnto their Chambers. FINIS. Contayninge: Many needefull regardes, for a Gentleman: with a Discouerie of the inconueniences of Marriages, where there are great inequalitie of yeares. Lanterne of broade day, so lightened euery Chamber of Segnior Phyloxenus Pallace: as ye Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, to bee auenged of the iniurie of Night, (who being the Mother of confusion, had seperated them, from their companions of pleasure) hastely rose and attired themselues: and (like vnto Partryges , that how so euer they are seauered, know (and retire vnto) their meetyng places) presented them selues, in the great Chamber. The office of ciuill courtesie discharged, such as were coupled, intertained Time, with ye deuice of their especial fancyes: others, contemplated of their priuate affaires:  & Ismarito amonge the rest, in a quiet place, was reading in Peter Mesiere his Cronicle of Memorable things: The rare Historie of Tamberlaine the Great,   [  Tamburlaine the Great, in the beginnig a Peasant. ] surnamed Flagellum Dei , where he much admired, the vertues of the man, who of a laboring Pesaunt, or (in the best degree) of a poore Souldier, by his vertues & Inuincible valure, became a great Monarch: Yea, and while Tamberlayne liliued, was as much feared as Alexander . But Ismarito , more lamented, that so mightie a Monarchie, erected by the Father, should end, by the enuy, and ciuill dissention of the Children. Segnior Philoxenus (after he had giuen a Bon giorno , to the companie, seing Ismarito , not chained to a companyon, determined to geue his solytarinesse, a disgrace, by conuersing with him, in some Gentlemanly Discourse:   [  He is not alone that hath good lookes. ] but finding him accompanied wt so sweet a companio, as Mesires Cronicles, Seg. Ismarito , ([quoth] hee) you haue deceiued my imagination, which perswaded mee yt you were solitarye, and therefore, bounde mee (in courtesye) to visite you. But,   [  A Gentleman tooke aduantage of a worde to praise the good, as to check the euyll. ] seeing the great personages, with whom you deuise, I enuie your happy contemplation. But your Enuie (quoth Ismarito ) is lyke that of Mutius Seauola , desirous to excell the better sort in vertue, as you exceede the rascall multitude in curtesie. This encounter, and a litle other pryuate talke ended: Segnior Philoxenus , lead Ismarito , into a fayre Lybrarie, beautified with such a number of goodly Bookes, of all Sciences,   [  A most famous librarie in the Dukes Pallace at Florence left by Cosmos de Medicis. ] Lawes, Customes, Gouernmentes, and memorial Monumets, as wel auncient as Modern, as it came very neare in excellencie, to ye famous Lybrarie of Cosmos de Medicis in Florence : who imitated in his Monument, Ptolomey , surnamed Philodelphus : who had ye seuentie Interpreters of the Iewes , to translate the Sacred Bible, into the Egiptian Language: and with great dyllygence, soughte to haue the seuerall Coppyes of all Bookes. After Ismarito had well regarded, the orderly sortinge of these (Bookes, and how, by a shorte Kallender, a Man without greate paine, mighte turne vnto anye harde Question, in any Science, and haue large resolutions) and had taken a note of the title of certayne Bookes that hee had not seene, and yet necessarie to be read. Segnior Philoxenus ledde him into his owne priuate studie which was furnished with Summaries,   [  It belongeth to a Gentleman to be sene in many things. ] or Abridgementes of all Sciences, which he studied, with such a iudgement, as there was no Arte, wherein he had not a speciall knowledge, whiche in argument, he exposed, with so good a wit & memorie as, manie times, he grounded Masters in that science. And for that in al his actions he was ye true patterne for a Gentleman to imitate. In honour of his worthines and for the benefite of such Gentlemen, as will folow his example, in Uertue, I am bounde to set briefely downe, the chiefest course of his Studie. First and principally,   [  Diuiuitie. ] for the comfort both of his bodie and soule. In Theologie, he reade those bookes, that cleared the mistes of Ignoraunce, and vnmasked the deceiptes of the superstitious Monkes, Friers. &c. And contemplated in the sweete comfort of those Aucthors, that expounded the hard passages of the Scripture. And for that Health ,   [  Phisyck. ] is the most precious Iuell of the worlde, knowyng the Constitution of his owne bodie, he studied so muche in Phisicke , as without the direction of Doctors, hee knewe, what meate and Medicine, agreede with his nature. To minister Iustice , vnto the Ignorant multitude, and to keepe hymselfe out of the Forfaites of Lawe,   [  Lawe. ] he studied the ciuill Law, and specially, the Statutes of his Countrey: And (questionlesse) the Gentleman, that is ignoraunt in the Lawes of his Countrey, is an enemye to hymselfe, and a Cipher in the comon weale. In Militarie knowledge, he was experienced, as wel, by seruice in the Field, Studie. And some trauell in this Arte, is needefull, as well as comendable for a Gentleman: for it is not ynough for hym, to be Togatus , as a Romayne Oratour, nor Paliatus , as a Gretian Phylosopher: in that he must as well in the field, looke his enemie in the face, as imbrace his frend in the house: and therfore, though he bare a Pen in his eare, to write his owne Commentaries) hee is bounde to weare a Sword by his side, to do his Countrie seruice. For Gouernment, and Ciuil behauiours, he read Plutarches Moralles: Guenaraes Dial of Princes: the Courtier of Count Baldazar, Castillio : and others.   [ Moralitie. ] And (in trueth,) it is not so necessarie, to be well borne, as to be well quallyted and of good behauiour: wherfore, the studie of Morallytie, is verie needefull for a Gentleman. He (likewise) studied Cosmographie , and had therin comendable knowledge: which studie, can not, but much please and commende a braue minded Gentleman: able to suruaye the whole worlde: and with an agreable Discourse, shall bound out a Stranger his owne Countrey. He was a good Hystorigrapher , and had read manie rare Chronicles.   [ Hystoriografie. ] How pleasing this studie is to a Gentleman, is liuely expressed in his owne nature, greedy of newes . And where may hee haue better intilligence, then Cronicles? in which, quietly in his owne Study, he may receiue knowledge, of Actes done throughout the whole worlde. He was a good Harrolde , and had read much in Armorie : An Arte most needefull,   [  Armorie. ] for a Gentleman, in that it is the Cognisaunce of himselfe. And in my opinion, he that is not able to blason his owne Armes, is not worthie to beare them. These Gentlemanly studies he vsed, intermedled with others of more pleasure, whiche I had not leasure to regarde, nor memorie to beare away: but in all his actions, and behauiours,   [  Segnior Philoxenus a perfect Courtier. ] he exposed a Gentleman so perfect, as in regarding of hym, but one halfe yeare, a man might haue noted downe a Courtier, not inferriour to that of Count Baldezar . By that time Segnior Philoxenus had sufficiently fed Ismaritos eyes, with this honourable fauour: the sounde of the Trumpet, gaue knowledge of dinner, so that Ismarito , was driuen to leaue, that earthly Paradice, to attende honourable Philoxenus , into the great Chamber: against whose comming, the Table stoode furnished with manye daintie Dishes. And Queene Aurelia , and the rest of the Companie, were readie to salute him: whiche curtesye perfourmed, she tooke her appointed place and the rest, as they pleased. Towardes the latter ende of this dinner, a meane fellow, garded between, two Furies of the Kitchen, was brought coram nobis : for some pettie piylfering in the Scullerie. Segnior Philoxenus , referred his paine to the Iudgement, of the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen there present. Some of the Gentlemen, appointed him some pleasaunt paine, in the office, where hee dyd the trespasse: some other of the Gentlewome ouercome, wt a natural pitty, accepted his teares in satisfaction, and so discharged him: But the Doctor more rougher then the rest, tooke him vp so short,   [  Wemen are to pitifull to be iudges. ] as the poore fellow was driuen to say, Sir, where you may help, hurt not : The Doctor, to satisfie his request, and to keepe his first determination, aunswered, to help hange a Theefe, is no hurte, to the common weale , your petition shalbe signed. The rascall Theefe, hearing this seuere Iudgement (as the Italians are naturally quicke witted) replyed: Maiestrates shoulde set their handes to this Iustice, There would bee more Lawyers hanged, for stealing of Houses, then Roges for robbinge of Headges . The aunswere of the Doctor, and the replye of the poore Fellow, made ye company so merrie, that for the pastime, the trespasser had made them, they remitted the punishment of his offence. The laughter quieted: in the commendation of his Countriemans capassitie (quoth Soranso ) Master Doctor, this poore Snake, spake true Italian . Yea (quoth the Doctor, but he lackes the vertues of the auncient Romaines : couertly expressing thereby,   [  Italians are wise, but euil conditioned ] yt their wits were good, but their conditions were euill. Bargetto enuying the fauours, Ismarito receaued, and for some pryuate grudge, about crossing in Argument) sought by some pleasant scoffe, to raise an vnkinde quarel: And with that intent (quoth he) Segnior Ismarito , I drink vnto you, with a better affection, than I bare you in my sleepe, for I dreamed, with my Rapire drawne,   [  Enuy euermore quarreleth, with those that are fauoured. ] I chased you, to your Chamber. Ismarito , quickly aunswered, I pleadge you ( Segnior Bergetto ) but with lesse feare then you supposed to bee in mee, when you were asleepe: for men after they are awake, expounde dreames by contraries.   [  Quarrelers seeke their owne mischiefe. ] Bergetto , deceaued of his expectation, was dryuen by patience, to salue the wounde, he had giuen hymselfe. But Segnior Philoxenus : to take away the cause of after vnkindnesse, reaued the companie, of leasure, to iudge of Bergettos quarrilynge dreame,   [  A wise foresight in a Gentleman. ] or of Ismaritoes crosse exposition, by keeping of them exercised with a newe deuice. In deede (quoth hee) Dreames are incertaine, and therfore, not to be regarded, true kinde of diuination, in Palmestrie , and so in looking in Maria Belochi's hand, hee vsed certaine names of Arte, and gaue a voluntarie pleasing Iudgement: which fired all the Ladies and Gentlewomen, with an earnest desire, to know their fortune: and by this meanes, the remembrannce, of former questions was taken away. Wherein Segnior Philoxenus wisdome, may be a president, for other Gentlemen, that heare quarrels a breedinge,   [  A necessarie note for a Gentleman, ] to smoulder them in the shell: for men that bee angrie, are bounde to their passion, when such as are not moued, haue libertie, to pacifye, with discreation. Thus, with their spirites well pleased, Queene Aurelia , and the reste of the companie, rose from the table, and after ordenarie curtesie ended, they paused a time by the Fire, to put their witts in order, for the following disputation: who at the ordinarie howre, entred the drawing Chamber, where the Eunuke readie to discharge his dutie, vnto the Lute sung this following Sonet. Although faire Dame, the least may moue content: For Loue, Faith, Zeale, standes firme in aged yeares, When light greene youth, is fickle in intent. The aged knowes, the leaues and fruite of youth, The leaues they leaue, and with the fruite doe loue: The sayinges of olde Age, are iudged trueth. Let loue and trueth, mislyking then remoue. What though my chin, be clothed all in white, Whight in your cheekes, the chiefest coulour is: Which fayre dye, doth make you seeme so bright, As men holde you, the source of beauties blisse. Sweete Mistresse then, of all the sayre, the Flower, Let not condemne, what doth your selfe comend: Ruthe seemes your face, let rigor not deuour, His loue, and lyfe, that liues and dies your friende. This Sonet, mooued ye company to smile, not because the inuention was vnwittie, but in that, it was the fruites of Doctor Mossenigoes Muse, who to reuenge vppon himselfe all the iniurie, which he had done to the sexe of Women, became inamoured of Katharina Trista , the waspissest Damosel, among the whole troupe of Gentlewomen: But knowing the Doctors Phylosophie , could not so subdue his affection: but that time would make them all sporte and him smarte, they dissembled their knowledge of his folly, as deepely as hee couered the passions of hys fancy: notwithstanding to raise some speach, and to set the Doctor a work with hope. [Quoth Aluisa Vechio ] this Sonet prophesieth a hapie lyfe to a young woman, and much comfort to an olde man if their fortunes be so good, as to be maried together. And if I had as good a passage, for my opinyon, as I haue Reason to mayntayne the same: I woulde thinke to prooue this couple, worthye of a place in PLATOES Paradice . Among so manie good Orators [quoth Queene Aurelia ] you cannot want an Aduocate. Whereupon Katharina Trista , with a false eye, coniured the Doctor, in this question, to maintaine his Loue : who thus inioyned, tooke vpon him to maintaine Aluisa Vechioes opinion. Queene Aurelia licensed him, and no aduersary appeared, to discourage him: wherevpon (quoth he) where an old man marieth a yonge woman, the contentment seemes too be muche,   [  Defences where an old man marrieth a yonge woman. ] and the comfort more: my reason is, the oulde man hath not onlye chosen a Wyfe, to recreate him as a companyon, but a Cooke to prepare chosen meates for his impayred appetite, and a Staffe to sustaine his Age. The yonge wife also may hold her selfe happie in this fortune: for she hath chosen one, whom she may not onely rule, but commaund: and for a litle paynes, who will leaue her possest of a great deale of lyuyng. And this is most certain, that cruel and wilde Creatures do most hurt, where their wyll is moste resisted: and hauo great compassion, where they finde no proffer of repulse: The Lyon in his greatest hunger, hurts not ye wounded sheepe: ye Crocadile wt teares wassheth the blood from a murthred man, and the raging Sea refressheth the yealding Reede: much more, a woman (that by nature is beautified with pittie) if she rule without checke, wyll glorie in the good vsage of her Husbande: and this is in dayly vse, that the olde man, in assemblies, findes his yonge wife, modest in her speache, basshefull in her lookes, and nice, in occasion of suspition: and whyther this behauiour proceedes of desire to be praysed, or of feare to be blamed, I conclude the cause with her comendation: for that to do well in hope of praise, comes of the incouragement of vertue: and to do well for feare of reprehensio, is the signe of a good inclination. By Sainct Anne Sir (quoth Soranso, ) you well deserue a Fee, (especiallie, of the yonge wyfe) in that you so connyngly haue coloured her ouersight,   [ Reproofe. &c ] and so Clarckely haue commended her good vsage of her olde Husband: but your Suggestion tends to as small effect, as the Fortune is euyl, of a couple thus vnequallie matched: for that common reason wil refute your weake opinion, and dayly experience recordes the miseries of the other. What likelyhood of continuance, hath the House, whose grounde worke is rotten, although the prospect be beautifull and stronge, God wotte the feeblenesse of the Foundation, wyll ouerthrow the firmenesse of the vpper frame. Compare this vneqaull estate in Marriage, with this ouersight in building, and you shall finde the discorde as great betwene the one, as the ruyne and decay, speedie in the other. The good and able Gouernment of the Husbande, is the foundation and grounde worke of Marriage: and the Beautie of the Wife, the blessynge in hauynge of Children: and the benefite of possessyng lyuinges, are the outwarde buyldinges of Mariage: And as they are pleasant in the eye of the worlde, euen so, they greatly please the mindes of the maryed, & geue a singuler Grace to this honourable vocation. But, if the Gouernment of the Husbande, be inabled, with Age: (as in trueth) Olde Age is no other then a seconde Infancie. In whose desire, direction, discrescion and delight, there, are imperfections. The Beautie of the wyfe, wyll be blasted with sorrowe: for the insufficiencie of her Husbande: euyll Education wyll accurse their blessyng in hauyng of Chyldren, and negligence wyll waste their benefites of liuyng. You hould a yonge wife, a Companion to recreate an olde man, but he shal finde her a Corsiue that wyl consume him to death. A yong man concludeth, the sweetest sollace in loue with sighes: it is then, lyke, an olde man endes it with teares: And God, he knowes, he often weepeth, more of desire, to please his wyfe, then of any Deuotion he hath to wantonesse: yet is al his paynes to a fruitlesse purpose, for that the Game finissheth in his griefe, & neither began nor endes in his wyues contentment. You are too quicke, in Aduauntage, Segnior Soranso, (quoth the Doctor) Oulde Wine,   [  Defence. &c. ] thoughe it be dead in the mouthe, yet is it warme in the Stomacke, when the Newe, fumes in the Heade, but comforteth not the heart. Dry woodde, maketh a bright Fyre, where greene Bowes consume halfe awaye in Fume and Somake. The Sonne riseth watrishlye, and is longe before it geueth heate, where, in the After noone, it scorcheth the face: So, a Yonge man deuideth his Loue, into a hundreth Affections, and euery fancie pleased, there wyll but a little fall to his wyues share: where an Olde mans Loue is settled, and his fancie is fixed vpon one: And as the resighted Examples, in Age, are in best hart: so to proue an olde mans sufficiencie, there is a common Prouerbe: Gray Haires are nourished, with greene thoughts . Now, to cotent his yong wyfe, she shal haue no cause to suspect his Affection abroade, and shall not lacke to bee belooued at home. Moreouer, whiche delighteth a yong woman, (who naturallye, is Ambitious) shee shall take her place, accordyng to the grauitie of her Husband, and not as her yong yeares requyreth. And to conclude, to giue her an honourable name, the most precious Iuell, with which, a woman may be beautified, she shall receyue graue Directions from her Husbande: and through the sweete delight, she taketh in hearyng her good Gouernment comended, she wyll put them in Execution. Doctor Mossenigo , replied not with this vehemencie, for any delight he had to commende this vnequall estate in Mariage, but to flatter Katharina Trista , with an Ambitious Hope, of great Reputation, in matchyng with his aged self: but she (that knew a leg of a Larke, was better then the whole Carkasse of a Kyte) woulde none God thank him. And to make him horne wood (if hee perseuered in his opinion,) in Soransoes behalfe (quoth Bergetto his auncient crosser:) Maister Doctor, theare is more pryde in your wordes, then Substance in your proofes: your hartie olde Wine, must be drawen out, when it is broached: your drie woodde is but a blaze, and your hot Sunne, doth but sweate, for sorow, that he is goyng to cowche in the dark Caues of Tartessus .   [  Reproofe. &c. ] But as touching Old men, they may well be sufficient in greene thoughts, as you terme them, but I am assured, that in deedes, they are weake, and wythered: And therefore, a man cannot speake too muche euill, of this excesse in dotage: withered Flowers, are more fit for a Dunghill, then meete to deck a house: olde rotten Trees, are needefull for the fyre, but vnnecessarie to stande in an Orchad: euen so, olde decaied creatures, are comely in the Church, but vnseemely by a yong womans side. The olde man, which marrieth a yonge Wyfe,   [  The mischaunces of an oulde man yongly maryed. ] is sure of this sowre sauce, to rellish his sweete Imaginations: his beloued wife (how so euer she dissembleth) disdayneth hym: his neighbors al to be flouteth him, and soothing Parisites, beguileth him: common opinion will counterfeit him lyke Acteon , not so much for the ficklenesse, they see in his wife, as for the infirmities, they know in himselfe. And breefely, to conclude his ioye:   [  A yong wyfe is death, to an old ma. ] hee may (perchaunce) lyue two yeares, with his faire wife: but the mischaunce of his Children, will remember his infamie, for euer: Greene Iuy, which catcheth an olde Tree, maketh quicke worke for the fire: and the imbracements of a faire Woman, hastneth an olde man to his Graue. And although it be a haynous wronge, causelesse to condemne the Wyfe:   [  An honest woman is lightly slaundered by the imperfections of her Husband. ] yet this will be the opinyon, shee killed her Husband with thought, to heare and see, how she trespassed, both against, his and her owne honour. Foule fall, suche a Marriadge (quoth Maria Belochy ) where the vertuous Wife, shal be slaundered, through the imperfections of her Husbande. It is some wrong ([quoth] Fabritio ) but she might haue foreseene   [ Repentance to late. ] the mischiefe, while she was free. Well (quoth Queene Aurelia ) vpon this knowledge of michaunce, our companie, are sufficiently warned.   [  The wise are warned by the mischaunces of other. ] Proceede in Iudgement, as you allow eithers opinion. Whereupon, Fabritio with Isabella , with one accord, gaue sentence, against Doctor Mossenigo , in these words. An olde man amourous, of a yong Woman, is an enemie, both to his health and reputation , for the causes aforesaid. The rest of the companie, smyled to heere this iudgement: but the Doctor, brake foorth many a secret sigh, not for the disgace he tooke in his pleading (for he defended an yll matter, with colour sufficient) but in that he knew this verdict would alwaies be a barre in his sute. While the Doctor and Soranso argued: Queene Aurelia , espyed in the Cloath of Arras : a Beast fourmed like an Unicorne, saue that he bare his Horne in his nose: whiche beast,   [  A Rhinocerot ] sleeping, laide his murthering Horne in a yong Maidens lap: and after the question was decided, shee demaunded, what that Beast was? and what the misterie signyfyed: but the meaning was as strannge, as the sight, to most of the companie. In the ende (quoth Ismarito ) Madam,   [  The Metamorphose of Rinautus, a Gentleman of Naples. ] I haue read of a gallant yong Gentleman of Naples named Rinautus , that was Metamorphosed into such a Beast, by this adueture: passing through the Iland Circeiu [that Homer speaketh off] which is now annexed vnto the Continent : he was espied of Circes , who inhabited that Ilande. This wrincled, yll fauoured Witch, at the first sight, was surprised in Loue, with the goodly shape and beautie of this seemely Gentleman: but for al her charmes, and Inchauntments, her Arte failed, either to force him to Loue, or to free her selfe from louing: for, notwithstandinge, shee was a Goddesse, he disdained her ouer worne, soule and wythered visage: and shee presumyng of her Sorcerie, powred fresh Coales, vppon her kyndled desyre, in hope that necessitie would force him to consent, to the requeste, freewill contemned: but Cupid (to whom such power onely belongeth) to scourge her presumption, in suche sorte hardened Rinautus harte, that all Circes Sute and Sorceries tended vnto a fruitlesse successe. In so much, as in her rage she turned him into a Rhinocerot , a Beast of vnconquerable force, who in his nose, beareth a horne, much like to the Unicorne: But notwithstanding hee was thus transfourmed (as King Nahucadonizer , in the fourme of an Oxe, retained the spirit of a man) so hee in his altered shape, nourished his auncient disdaine of yll fauoured Circes : and to bee fully auenged, with all hys force, pursueth olde Creatures: and such as hee ouertaketh, hee goreth to death: yet is he by this polycie subdued: Place a faire Maide, in his walke, and foorth with hee will with a louinge countenaunce, repaire vnto her, and in her bosome, gently bestow his murthering Horne: and sodainlye, (as one rauished with contentment) hee fauleth a sleepe, by which meanes he is slaine before he recouereth the vse of his force. The Companie laughed well, to heare this straunge Metamorphosis . In the end ([quoth] Queene Aurelia ) I would Maister Doctor had hard this Hystorie, when hee so inuayed against Beautie, perhaps, he would haue bene affraide of her vengeaunce, seeing her power able to conquere sauage & wilde Beastes. But the Doctor, glad of this aduantage,   [  Euyll men care not for the conscience, so they haue a colour for their offence. ] not vnlyke the cuning Lawier, that buyeth Robin hoodes penniworthes, & yet with some nice forfaitures, threatneth the seller, with continuall bondage: & many times, bringeth backe his money, and keepeth his bargen: not caring for his Concience, so that hee haue a colour for his offence: or as the wysest sorte of Atheistes , that (liue as though, they hoped neyther after heauen, nor feared Hel) yet confesse God with their mouth, because the contrarie woulde make them hated of men: so he by this tale, found out both a warrant, to maintayne his former Blasphemie, and to excuse his present Follie in Loue: And to Authorize either: Madame (quoth he,) the inchaunted Beaste, approoueth myne opinion of Beauties power, and his Death is a greater witnesse of her crueltie, then is Doctor Mossenigo ,   [  The force of Beautie. ] who confesseth that men, in vayne prescribe Remedies for the Affected, or Receites, to preserue men from the Infections of Beautie . You are welcome vnder our Lee [[quoth] Aluisa Vechio .] But, to take awaye all hope of good intertaynment: (quoth Katharina Trista ) no, no, Maister Doctor,   [  No Affliction, but hath his remedie. ] you deceyue your selfe: Beautie , neyther retaineth the power, nor poyson, which you speake of, and with you, Ouid and all the amorous Poets are mistaken: who say, Affection, riseth from Beautie, and not of the free wyll of man: But say you all what you please: good foresight wyll contrary your opinions. There is no sore, but hath his salue: no griefe, but hath his remedie: nor no daunger, but may be forstoode, eyther by prayer or good indeuoure. In deede (quoth Faliero) Socrates altred his inclination, by the Studie of Phylosophie:   [  Examples to be regarded. ] The Nyniuites preserued their Cittie by prayer: and Virbius dubled his life, by mastering of his disposission. Floradin ,   [  Idlenes noorisheth and exercise remedieth loue ] bewitched with the loue of faire Persida , his deare friend Pericles Wife, wrote in a table Booke: fye Floradin , fye, shee is thy friend Pericles Wife: and so often as idlenes presented him with thys passyon, he read his written remembraunce: and by some honest exercise, remooued his imagination. This is not your day Maister Doctor (quoth Soranso ) I beleeue, there is some vnkindnes betweene Saturne and Venus , by the enuious aspeckt of some other Plannet this howre. It maye be (quoth the Doctor) by the flatterie of Mercurie,   [  Flatterie, the enemies of trueth. ] who is euermore enemie to the plainnes of trueth. Well (quoth Queene Aurelia ) let vs leaue this bye matter, and consider better of Ismaritos Metamorphosis: me thinks it prophesieth muche mischaunce to an Oulde Wydowe, whiche marieth a Yonge man, and no greate pleasure to the yonge maried Bacheler. O good Madam,   [  Mariage commended betwene an olde woman and a yong man. ] say not so (quoth Soranso ) for in this fortune, lyeth a yonger Brothers welfare: and the cause that maketh happinesse accompanie olde women to their Graue. It may well be to their Graue (quoth the Doctor) but it bryngeth sorow into their House,   [  Reproofe. &c ] and maketh their life more vnpleasant then death: and if Soranso followe this Course, perhappes his day wyll be no better then Doctor Mossenigos . Queene Aurelia smilinge, saide, shee feared this contention woulde bring the companie to hell gates. Yet quoth she, In that I imagine the way will be pleasaunt, I licence you to perseuer in your purpose. Uppon which warrant (quoth Soranso ) to maintaine   [  Defence. &c. ] that to be true, which I haue alreadie alleadged in the commendation of this estate in marriage. This further reason (in my conceite) you will neither disalowe, nor the married couple shall haue cause to mislike: which is where a fresh young Gentleman, either of small liuing, or farre spent with lustinesse, lights of a rich olde widow, for that both their desires in this fortune shall bee satisfied.   [  A good exchange of Marchandice. ] He shall haue plentie of Coyne, the onelie Grace hee lacked, and she the possession of a goodlie Parsonage, the cheefest Iewel she loueth: which exchaunge of Marchandise can not chuse, but continue their liking and raise much contentment. Cleane contrarie ([quoth] the Doctor) for ye follies of a yong ma is sufficiently punished, by marrying an olde woma: & ye sins of an olde widdow, ar fully plagued, in matching wt a yong man: for that (contrarie to your suggestion) neither can inioye, the cause of their Mariage, without annoyance to their mindes: for his lyking, is fastned on her riches, which she will not, but by necessitie leaue:   [  The euylles in an olde wydowe. ] & her loue is setled on his person, which for her pleasure, he disdaineth to punish. The vnfortunate yongman, knowes not what greefe hee ioynes to his gaine, in matchinge with an olde widdow, till that experience breakes them forth in sighes: If his wife be ritche, shee will looke to gouerne, if shee bee poore, he is plagued, both with beggery, and bondage: If she be proude, she will hide her abylytie, to maintaine her pompe: If she be testie, he is forst to pacience: If she bee Ielous, hee canne hardlye indure her rages. And to conclude, if the olde doting widdow be free from one of these faults, she is tied to forty euils of lesse sufferaunce: or if her Husbande commaunde her will, shee straight waies sayeth her other Husband was more kinde: If hee chance to dine from home, she wyls him to sup with his harlots: if he spend beyond her allowance, thus she reuiles hym: A Begger I fownd thee, and so thou wylt leaue mee. To chastice her talke, setteth an edge of her tongue: to suffer her in her rage, maketh her raylynges irreuocable. By your wordes, Maister Doctor [[quoth] Lucia Bella ,] the wife is the greatest cause of this contention, and yet in common opinion, the Husband is most blamed. Madame, you are too hastie in an aduauntage, I ment no such parciallytie (quoth the Doctor. Yea Madame, (quoth Bargetto ) M. Doctor is now so conquered, as his tong is the Trumpet of your pleasure. It is so (quoth the Doctor) to sound out those thinges which are true: and in trueth, the yonge Husbande often tymes,   [  PLATOUS Hell in Mariage. ] maketh the euilles, good in deedes, which the olde wyfe vseth but in wordes: for no lenger then she feedeth him with Coyne, shall she enioy his companie: If she rob not her Children to inrich him, she shall lack no froward lookes, nor fowle vsage: If she put him in possession of her lyuing, he straight wayes dispossesseth her of his loue: for hauing, what he sought, he wyl els where be enamoured. And, vprightly to speake, she lacketh neither occasion too lament, nor cause to be inraged: for who is so patient, as can dissemble her vnsufferable passions? both, to be spoyled of her lyuing, and to be exyled from that she loueth: And, in verie trueth, so egall are their euilles, as it were a harde matter to iudge, who deserueth leaste blame, or most excuse: She reproacheth him, of Beggerie, Hooredome, Unthriftinesse, yll vsage: and of the ruine, both of her selfe and her Children. He blameth her of Olde Age, Ielousie, curstnesse, scowldyng: & for hidyng of her goods, which he hath bought, with doyng Iniurie vnto his person. If she be determined to be merie, he (scornfully) telleth her, that it is as sightly, for a toothelesse Mare to eate Marchpane, as for suche a wrinckled Mumpes to fawle a bylling. If he come in wel disposed, & affably intreateth her, she calleth him dissembling Hipocrite, & saith, he saluteth her wt his tong, but his hart imagineth of his minions abroade: she runneth to ye neighbors to coplaine: In the meane while he sendeth her corne to the Market, and her cattel to the Faire. If the frends, of good wil, or neighbours, of charytie, labour to accord their cotention (as she imagineth to shame him) she thundreth out a thousad Iniuries that he doth her: for her owne praise, she saith, that of pure loue she maried him with nothing: and to reproch him, she sweares, he hath spent her substance, & hateth her person: To show her owne good Huswiferie, she tels that she worketh al day at her Distaffe: & to blase his vnthriftinesse, she showeth how he plaieth away her gaines at Dice: She crieth out, that (perfore) he taketh what he openly findeth, & priuylie stealeth, what she secretly hideth These, & many moe complaints, she preferreth against her Husband, wt the vehemencie of a womans passion. Her Husband, yt knoweth how to be reueged in deedes, (for his own credit) is more milde in words: he layeth al these blames vpo her own crooked dispositio: who though she be so olde, as a man can hardly loue her, yet wt a cankred ielous froward nature, she wold force a man to hate her: But what remedie, since his fortune was so hard? he wold starue her wt patience: and only adde this Suffrage to his Letanie: A praua muliere , good Lord, deliuer mee. These drie scoffes, sets her hart in a light fire, and (saue that she hath not so many colours like) vnto Iris , thudreth out the venome of her cankred Spirit in reuylings, and raylyngs against her Husbande: And (to say trueth) her case is to be pittied, as much as her tong is to be blamed: for Iniurie is not so greuous vnto a man, as to see his Aduersarie soothe his trespasse with an honest shoe. But to my purpose,   [  A great cause of Impatience. ] her Husband crosseth her with a quiet Aunswere: you may see friendes, sayth he, wyld fire wyl burne in water, Drinke wil make the Dropsie dry, and mildnes in mee, mooueth madnesse in my wife: by her example here, you see my lyfe at home, as tedious as Hel: then (perhaps) som flowting Marchat, sayth: lyke ynuffe, and the shee Deuill weareth the hornes. Thus with their own micheefes, they greue their friends, delight their foes, and wearie their Neighbors, in according their debates: and if they be in the morning quieted, and go home in peace, at Noone like enemies they ar redy to throwe the house out at the window: a slut like the furie of lothsomenes, shall bring in dinner, because the Ielious wife, dare not trust her husbande with any maide that is hansome: the husbande offended, throweth the Platters at her head, and axeth if she meane to poyson him: the Wife taketh pepper in the nose, and sayth, if hee had not married her, he woulde haue beene glade of the worst morsell there. The Husband replieth that if he had not beene so mad, the diuell would not haue married her. Then beginneth the old Musik, tuned perchance with a rap or two of the lippes, and when they haue brawled their fill, shee runneth and bemoneth her selfe at her neighbors, and he goeth and maketh himselfe merie with his Mistrisses. In sooth, maister Doctor, it seemeth to mee (quoth Sir Soranso ) that you haue verie substancially proued my opinion:   [  Defence. &c. ] for Marriage equallye deuideth her blessings, and mischaunces, betweene the married: and as farre as I can see, neither of these knoweth, who hath the better or worser bargen: there is raylinges and vnquietnesse of both sides: but what of that, pleasure is best seasoned with paine: and though they sometimes iarre at home, they agree wel whe they are seperated among their neighbours. And although you haue streatched their debates, vpon the rack of vengeaunce: yet at aduenture, I wish my selfe no worse bestowed, then marrie an to old welthy Widdow. I doo not thinke, but by good vsage, to continue her first affection geeuen, euen vnto hir verie Graue. You will kill her with kindnesse, (quoth Maria Belochye .) Yea, Madam, ([quoth] Soranso ) if her nature be so froward, as to die with good vsage. In deede Ladyes quoth the Doctor, there are some men, that entertaine their olde wiues, with such a fayre showe of flattering looue, as they bewitche them euen to theyr latter gaspe. But at what rate dooth she purchase this kindenesse? O euen with the vndooing of her selfe and Children: yea, and which is worse,   [  A most wicked pollysie. ] it is the pollicie of Father in lawes, to dandle the infancie of theyr wiues Children, in the lap of Ignorance, to this ende, that beeing of lawfull age, they may with lesse fetches beguyle them of theyr liuing: so that the vnfortunate childe, knowes not whether he may more bemone his losse of liuing, or lacke of good bringing vp: and in my iudgement,   [  Senecas opinion that Children were better to be dead borne then ignoraunt of good letters. ] of bothe the euils: want of education is the greatest: for learning and vertue purchaseth liuing, and lyuing corrupteth, but coyneth not good conditions: and as Seneca sayeth, libertie without learning is a bondage to the minde: and further, the Childe were better to be dead borne, then barren of good Letters, for that Ignoraunce is a graue which buryeth life. Maister Doctor (quoth Queene Aurelia ) me thinketh your wordes doo too much wrong to the wife, though they cannot sufficiently blame the husband. I graunt that father in lawes, esteeme their owne profiets, before theyr wiues Chyldrens preferments: but yet (I suppose) Nature dooth direct the naturall Mother, to eye theyr good bringing vp, who with muche sorrowe brought them foorthe:   [  Thinges that are besst esteemed. ] For (as the Prouerbe goeth) things that are dearely bought, are of vs intirely belooued, and nothing is more dearely purchased, then what is attayned with the hazarde of life, which venter the Mother maketh, before she is assured of her Childe: then this cruelty towardes her Children, to satisfye the wyll of her second husbande, wyll make indifferent men holde her an vnnaturil Mother whether her husband esteeme her a duetifull wife or no. Oh good Madame quoth the Doctor,   [  Reproofe, &c. ] how can the Hen succour her Chickens, when she her selfe is at the mercy of the Kite? how can the Conny preserue her Rabets, when the Ferret is in possession of her Burrowe? and how may the vnfortunate Mother, Foster her shiftlesse Children, either as she should or would, when her fancie or folly hath enthralled her to a second Husband, whose power is to direct, and displeased, to check? This seueritie of Father in lawes, hath bred much diuision in Marriage: but still the quarrels are concluded, with the detryment of the Children: for the vnhappie wife, is bound to one of these two euils, either to agree to the tyrannizing of her entrayles,   [  A hard extremitie. ] or to yeelde to her owne continuall sorrow and vnquietnesse: And where the case is so desperate, it may be lamented, but not wondred at, that necessitie breake the boundes of nature. To staye this mischeefe (quoth Helena Dulce ) Honourable is the custome of Spaine ,   [  An honorable custome of Spaine. ] where the vertuous Dame holdeth the second Mariage, a retrograding of her reputation, and a wrong to her deceased husband: for by this stayednesse, she is in possession of her libertie, and hath the disposing of her liuing. I holde this precise custome (quoth Dondolo ) more profitable then necessarie: for the penaunce were to harde, yea, vnpossible to be indured, that the lusty young Widdowe should be constrayned to a Uirgins chastytie, for as Ouid deuineth. I that some times of Nuptiall rites, Haue taste the pleasant toyes: Now cannot chuse, but call to minde, Dame Venus sugred ioyes. But if the aged widdow, could liue within this lawe, it would bring honour to her yeares, and happinesse to the ende of her life. What better husbands may she haue, then her owne Children,    [  Meete husbandes for aged widdowes. ] whom shee may bothe commaund and controule, whose dutyes are to labour in her causes, and to vnburden her heart of cares? and when she departeth this life, where may she better dispose her liuing, then vpon her own Children, whom to releeue, she is coniured by nature, and to bring vp in good nurture, bound in conscience: But from the beginning so rife hath beene the dotage of Widdowes, that when their feeble legges, faintely supporteth their consumed bodyes, when at hie noone, their mistie eyes hardly discerneth the hye way, and when (forste) thorough lack of teethe, they swallowe theyr meate, theyr lippes notwithstanding, take delight in kisses, and their mindes thirst after wantonnesse. Mens follyes are as great as Womens simplicities, in this ouersight in dotage (quoth Queene Aurelia ) but I thinke it necessarie, that heere we staye our iorney, least we enter into Hell, before we be aware: and therefore Segnior Fabritio , I pray you let vs haue your sentence, to ouer rule this question. Madam (quoth Fabritio ) the euill of this inequallitie   [  Experience is a iudgement it selfe. ] in Mariage, is bothe so auncient and so common in vse, as there needeth no other iudgement, then experience of our neighbours mischaunces, but to succour the iniured children, I would that one of Laertius lawes, were common to ye whole world: which is,   [  A worthie lawe, made by Laertius. ] wher the Tennaut sued his Lorde, the Seruaunt his Maister, or the Childe his Parents, that Iudges themselues, should foorthwith looke into the Processe, and determine the same, for it is vehemently to be supposed, that these sutes are foreced vpon vehement iniuries, otherwise the Seruaunt would feare to sue his Maister, who hath power moderately to chasten him: the Tennant would quake to vnquiet his Lord, who hath many meanes to crosse him, and without whose grace he may neuer liue in peace. Shame and dutie (in any sufferable matter) would make the childe forbeare to molest his Parets, for (but where his cause is known) Reporte like a two edged Knife, would (besides his iniurie) wound him with blame, and omission of dutie. Therfore, where the least of two daungerous euils, foreceth the aboue sayd to sue, it is much to be lamented, that delaye, countenaunce of freends, corruption with bribes, and other supporters, which the riche hath, should torment the poore complaynant, more then his originall iniurie. Your reason is but iust, quoth Queene Aurelia , and the rest of the company: who wearie with the multitude of the resited mischaunces, heere broke of the Disputation, and went and reposed themselues in the great Chamber. Phyloxenus , and his Honourable Guestes. suruey theyr accounts, to see what fortune and mischaunce they haue receyued thorough the whole yeare past. Segnior Philoxenus (towards the latter end of Supper) smilelingly, demaunded an account of the benefit of the chosen companies sixe dayes Disputation. Sir (quoth Soranso , with a modest merry countenaunce) we are like to present you a Banckrupts reckoning, who the longer he occupieth,    [  It is no striung against the streame. ] the worse he thriueth: so we these sixe dayes, haue trauailed to finde out a way, to the Parradise in Mariage, and euery day we haue been further and further off, of our determination, one day we thought that the wealthy matches of Parentes, would haue speeded our iorney, but there, lack of loue in the Children, cast vs behinde hand: an other day, we imagined that free choise in the Children, would haue directed vs to happinesse in Marriage: but want of maintenaunce and frowardnes in the parentes, marred this match. In lofty loue we found dainger: in base loue lothesomnesse and inconstancy: and where there is inequality of yeares, fume and smoke of Hell: so that now wee shall be dryuen to renounce our profession: and runne awaye with the Banckrowt, least (if he staye, as he is chopped vp in pryson so) we, if wee proceede any further be drowned in the ryuer Stix . If you trauaile with as much pleasure, as you report your aduentures with ease, quoth Signior Philoxenus , I wonder but a little though errour carryed you to Hell gates: but to incourage you to perseuer in your fyrst purpose, let this comfort you that thinges when they are at the worst, begin again to amend. The Feauer giueth place to health, when he hath brought the pacyent to deathes doore. The Bee, when he hath lefte his stinge in your hand without dainger may playe with your eye lidde: so, when all the inconueniences of Marriage, are in your eares, you may very well receiue her into your heart: and to conclude your benifytte with your owne example,   [  The thriuing vnthrift proues the the best husband. ] there is no such husband as the vnthrifte, when he fasteneth vppon the worlde: for in spending of other mennes goodes he learned howe to spare his owne, when he gettes them: so in the pleasaunt beating out of these inconueniences, you knowe what maketh Marriage bitter, and the greefe knowen, the remedye is easie. With your fauour, Sir, quoth Dondolo , to be sicke is common to all men, but to restore to health, vnder God, is the offyce of the Phisition: so we all knowe by our owne trauaile, the infirmities of Marriage, but to fynde out the blessinges, muste proceede from your sound directions which fauour to obtaine we are all earnest suters. Your request is so iuste quoth Segnior Philoxenus , that if I were able (as I am not) to better your iudgementes, I would not be daintye in this pleasure: but for that the more the opinions are, in the end, the more profound the sentence is: I wyll too morrowe (in part, to satisfie your demaund) ioyne with you in your ordinarie sweete exercise. Perchaunce you haue ended all the inconueniences in the olde yeare, and I may begin the New yeare, in helping to bloome the blessings of Marriage. Queene Aurelia and the rest of the company, affectionately thanked Signior Philoxenus for this hye fauour: and so rose from the Table, who after a little pawsing, daunsing and deuising: at theyr pleasures, went vnto theyr lodginges. FINIS. Containing: a Discourse of the excellencie of Marriage: with many sound Lawes and directions, to continue loue betweene the married: with the rare Historie of Pyrigeus and Pieria , reported by Segnior Phyloxenus : And other good notes of regarde. sound of Trumpets, noyse of Drums, and neying of Horses, dooth awake the Souldiors and Cittizens, before Aurora be willing to leaue the sweete embracements of her husband Tithon : so, euen with the departure of the day Star, in honour of the New yeare, the Trumpets, Drumes and Flutes, sounded through euery small passage, into the lodgings of Segnior Philoxenus Pallace, such shrill salutations, as the company enuying the confusion of night: broade waking, attended the Mornings light, to apparell themselues: who in theyr moste braue and sumptuous araye, by nine of the clock, made the great Chamber resemble a fayre Garden in Maye. In the imbroderies of whose Garments, Flowers and fancies, were so naturally and artificially wrought: some of Pearle, some of golde, some of Bugle, euery one according to their one humour: More ouer, euery Gentlemans head was armed with his Mistrisses fauor, and euery Gentlewomans hart, was warmed with her seruaunts affectio. In the most soueraigne place of the great Chamber, Ianus , God of Time (as the Poets faine) was hung vp, in the likenes of a Serpent, winding his body into a circkle and holding his taile in his mouth, expressing vnder this figure his reuolution,    [  The yeare endeth and beginneth in it selfe. ] who through his continuall motions enuironing and compasing the world, retourneth into himselfe, and endeth and beginneth in himselfe: and in ioyfull token of the newe yeare, he was garnished with many sweete flowers, garlandes, and deuices: some artificiall liuelely counterfeited. Segnior Philoxenus although he hated superstitious Ceremonies,   [  Ancient customs are to be kepte. ] and shund them, yet he honored auncient lawdable customes, and kept them: who according to the custome of the countrey, presented euery one of his guests,   [  The vertues of the minde are more glorious then any outward garment. ] with a riche new years gifte, which explayned some morrall vertue. Among the reste he gaue his sister Queene Aurelia , a fayre plaine tablet, which opened, represented the picture of a faire Lady garnished with many precious stones: couertly, expressing thereby, that gorgeous apparell was but base and counterfeit, in respect of the braue vertues of the mynde. This order the Italians vse,   [  Custome in Italye in giuing of new yeares giftes, contrarie to the custome of England. ] the best giueth newe yeares giftes to his inferior freendes, and in England cleane contrarie. The Tennaunt giueth his Lord: the meane Gentlemen, to Knightes: Knightes to Barrons: Barrons to Earles: Earles, Marquises: and Dukes, to their soueraigne Prince: but it seemeth the Englishmen, obserue this custome more neere the originall then the Italians :   [  The originall of nevv yeares giftes. ] for the fouders therof were the aucient Romaines , who bounde theyr Knights, the first day of Ianuarie , in the Capitole, to present theyr Newyeares giftes, to Caesar Augustus , were he absent, or present: but so many Countryes, so many customes. And (to my purpose) Segnior Philoxenus , thus bountifully solemnized the vse of his owne Countrey. This memorable curtesie perfourmed, Segnior Phyloxenus , with some of the grauer company, went before vnto the Chappell, and Queene Aurelia and her attendantes, followed with such a glyttering show, as the Preests needed no other Tapers to see to say seruice by, then the glimmering reflexions of the Gentlewomens eyes, and the pretious stones they wore in theyr Iewels: and in my oppinion, God was better pleased, and more honoured, with the Brauerie of the companie, then with the babling and Ceremonies of the Priest: who in the honour of the New yeare , sets forth his relikes to the best showe: By that time Seruice was ended, and the companie retourned: the Tables were furnished with many daintie Disshes: to wreake her hunger of some few wherof, Queene Aurelia , tooke her Royall place, and the rest of the companie, as they pleased. This Dinner was spent in Discourse of certain Ceremonies and olde Rites vsed in times past, in the celebrating of God Ianus Feast, too tedious, and (withall impertinent for this Discourse. When Dinner, and a little other pausyng talke was ended, the companie arose: and Queene Aurelia , with the reuerent Salutations of the whole troupe, retyred into her owne Chamber, tyll the howre of Disputation sownded: About which time, she, with Segnior Phyloxenus , and the rest of her Attendauntes, entred into a moste delycate Banquetinge House, where, vppon the Walles, in so good order, and representation of Nature:   [  Segnior Philoxenus banqueting hous ] were painted, all maner of Fruictes, Flowers, Uines, Arbors, and causes of Pleasure, either in Orchard or Garden: as a ma (without blushing) might haue aduetured, to gather vpon the bare Walles, a Pomegranate, a Cluster of Grapes, a Gyllyflower, or suche lyke: had not the dead of Winter, reaued the likelyhoode, that they should be perfect. After Queene Aurelia , & the rest of the companie, had taken their places, in this earthly Paradice: Segnior Phyloxenus (secretly) wylled ye Eunuke , to chaunt out the prayses of Hymen : who obaying this Charge, tuned his Lute, and to a sweete Noate, sung this following Sonet. Amonge greene leaues, his purpled Grapes doth beare When [wanting props] himself doth ouerwhelme, And for the fire his Braunches doth prepare. So two in one, with Hymens ryghtes fast bound, Of their sweete loue, liue alwayes in the seede: When Death, or time, the single doth confounde, Which ruine of fame, the barren thought doth breede Sweete Hymen then, thy Godhead Iadore, And bow myselfe, by thee to be controlde: In foulded Armes, my Spouse my eyes before: Yeelds more content, then Dymonds, Pearle, & Gold In quiet home, vncheckt, to rule, and liue, What lyfe more sweete? what hartes ease like to this? Or through mischaunce, my mind when care doth greeue What Medicine, is better then a kysse? At vnawares geuen by a louyng wife, O none, nor state, lyke to the married lyfe. This Sonet ended, and well considered: Sir (quoth Queene Aurelia to Signior Philoxenus ) to be reuenged of the iniurie,   [  Among the iust, promise is kept. ] of our former disputations who: haue painted Marriage with a thousand inconueniences, I beseeche you, and binde you by your promise, to blazon the blessinges and excellencie of this sacred Institution: that she who is diuine may haue her due prayses, and we that are ignoraunt, may knowe how to receiue her benefites, and with the same to honour her.   [  To praise, or blame, is qualitie of wit, but to direct is a worke of iudgement. ] Madame, (quoth Segnior Philoxenus ) you charge me, beyonde my promise, and binde mee to an impossibilitie: I promist but to ioyne with this quick witted Company in opinion, which I am readie to accomplish. To blaze the excellencie of Marriage, is a worke of no great difficultie, because her vertues illustreth the same through the whole worlde, but to direct the maried, is a labor of Art, wit, and experience; in the fyrst, wherof, I am ignoraunt, in the second vnperfect, and to the thirde a Strainger: so that, as I am sorry to iniurie your expectation, so am I loth to expose my insufficient iudgement. Sir (quoth Queene Aurelia ) if wee were not assured of a lyberal contentment, waightie Censure, we would receiue your modest refusall, for iust excuse. But for that we haue all an intrest in your vertues, & you should be enemie, to your owne honorable comendation,   [  Princes commandements must be obayed. ] in keeping of them close prisoners in your brest (although you be Lord of the Pallace) yet I, as soueraigne of the Ciuill Pleasures, commaund you to giue Cerimonies a disgrace, and sincerely to obay my will. Madam (quoth Segnior Philoxenus ) so strickt is your charge, as I must aduenture, of this waighty labour, hoping, that as by aucthoritie you commaund my opinion,   [  Of the exelencie of mariage. ] so by ye motion, of some one of your vertues, you wil pardon my errours. Upon which incouragement, to obay your wyll, I say, and approue, by sacred Authoritie,   [  Mariage instituted before the fall of Adam, by God in the earthly Paradice. ] that this holy Institution of Marriage, was erected by God, in the earthly Paradice, before the transgression of Adam , when he ioyned him to Eue , with these wordes of blessing, Increace, multiply, and replenish the earth . Againe, after Adams fall, and the deluge: to strengthen his fyrst institution, God commaunded, the good Patriarcke Noe, to encrease and multiply the earth a new . Moreouer, God would haue no more women, then men, in his Ark, to show there shoulde be a Sympathie in number,   [  A confirmation of the fyrst institution by God. ] as well as agreement in loue betwene man, and wife: for if the one might lawfullye haue many Wiues, and the other, many Husbandes: how should this expresse Commaundement of God be vnuiolated? You shall be two bodies in one flesh, and no more .   [  Man and wife are two bodies and but one flesh. ] Compare the Ioye, honour and reuerence, geuen vnto Mariage, by the delight, that proceedeth from any other cause, and you shal see her gleame, lyke a blasyng Comet , and the other, but twinckle as an ordinarie Starre.   [  The ioye of of marriage shineth aboue al other delightes. ] Gorgeous and rich Apparayle, delighteth the Gasers eye: and (perhaps) offendeth the wearers hart: where Maryage, in homely Attyre, is euery where honored, and reaueth vnquiet wandring thoughts, from the Maried: to abounde in riches, is a glorious fortune, but they charge men with a dubble care,   [  Children are the most rich iuelles in the worlde. ] extreame in the getting, and fearefull in the keeping: the married, hath as great, or greater ritches, in their children. When the stately Dames of Rome , bragged of theyr Iuelles, Cornelia boasted that hers, excelled them all. A Ladye of the company, seeing her, set forth with none, that was precious, demaunded where her Iuelles were? Yonder quoth Cornelia , and poynted to her children. When certaine most rare, and precious Iuelles, of King Darius ,   [  This Iuell, was her sonne Alexander. ] and his wiues, were presented to Olympia , Mother of Alexander the great, she bestowed them vpon her Ladyes, as to lowe prised for her wearing, who was continually, adorned with a Iuell, in value, as riche as Asia, Affrica , and Europa . And sure Queene Olympia , and Ladye Cornelia ,   [  The blessing of Children, is a duble life ] gloried not in their Iuelles, without reason: for golde, and precious stones, set but a glose, vppon beautie, when vertuous children, geueth a newe lyfe vnto their parentes. The administration of Iustice,   [  Offices of Iustice apartaine to the maried ] and aucthoritie, in a common weale, are the proper offices of the married: for that the care of wife, & children, presupposeth them to be setled: when the vnmarried, though their wittes be good, rayseth a suspition in the wise,   [  The sweete Symphatie betweene the married. ] that their thoughtes, are vagrant. The vnmaried, hath no agreable Companion, to participate of his pleasure, or to lessen his sorrowe. The Maried, hath a Companion of his owne flesh, of his owne wyll,   [  Loue to our Parents, reuerent. ] and of his owne Spyryt, so wrought to his owne Affection: that betweene them, there is seene two bodies, & but one thought, perceiued: The Maried ioy alike, sorrow alike:   [  Loue to our Bretheren, naturall. ] are of one substace, one concord, one wealth, one pouertie, Companions at one Boorde & in one Bed. The loue we beare vnto our Parents, is (or ought to be) reuerent and duetifull, because, they gaue vs lyfe: Vnto our Breetherne,   [ Loue to our Friendes, affectionated. ] naturall, because of the priuitie in blood: To our frendes, affectionate, by certaine Motions & consents of the minde: Notwithstanding, that these Loues be thus greate, yet are there diuers causes too lessen them. But betweene the married, no mischaunce, or infirme Fortune, is cause sufficient of hatred: for none,   [  Loue betwen the married irreuocable. ] gouerned by reason, is so inhumaine, as to mallice his owne fleshe: Compare their seuerall affections, by sorrow, and you shal see the weakenes of the one, in regarde of the strength of the other. The greatest mone we make, for the death of our Father, Brother, or friend, appeareth in sighes,   [  A good mean to trye the loue of the married. ] or (most vehement) in teares: whereas if wee our selues, are but a little wounded, we crye outright: so that by howe much we exceede, in sorrowing our owne mischaunces, aboue another mans: by the same reason, so much we loue our selues, more then another.   [ The rynge, a triall of the loue betwene the married. ] The Rynge that is geuen by the Husbande, and put on the Wiues finger, ought to be of Gould, to witnes, that as gould is the most precious of Mettalles, so the loue of the married, exceedeth all other loues. To which effecte, Propertius sayth, Omnis amor magnus, sed aperto in coniuge maior : moreouer,   [  An other fygure of the rynge. ] the close Ioyning of the ringe, is a figure of true vnitie of the married: betweene whom, there should be no diuision in desire, no difference in behauiour.   [  Christ was borne of a married woman. ] To honour this holy institution of God, God would haue his onely begotten sonne, to be borne of a Wife, perfectly married, saue that shee was not Carnally soyled. Licurgus , the good King of the Lacedemonians ,   [  Licurgus law for the vnmaried. ] so reuerenced this sacred estate, as he made a Lawe, that what Lacedemonian soeuer were vnmarried, after the age, of thyrtie and eyght yeares, should be chased and hissed out of all publique playes, and assemblies, as one, vnworthy to be seene: & that, in the cold winter, he shuld (naked) indure the reproches of the people: and withall, was bounde to confesse, how he iustly suffred ye punishment, as a Mispriser of Religion, a contemner of Lawes, and an enemie to nature. The Romaines were not so seuere: vnmaried, were condempned (accordyng to their abylytie (to pay vnto the Treasurer, for publique vse, a good Sume of Money. Plato, in his Lawes, enacted: that the Unmaried, shuld execute,   [  Platos lawes for the vnmaried. ] no honourable Office, Estate, nor dignytie, in the Common wealth. The good Emperour, Alexander Seuerus , although he maryed, rather, to geue ende to his Mother, Mammeas , Importunyties: then (as he thought) to begin a more happie lyfe: yet fayre Memmia , his wyfe, so naturally accorded with his disposition, as when she died, he would often renewe his Sorowe, and remember her Uertues, in these wordes. So great a Treasure, as I haue lost, a man seldome findeth :   [  Alexander Seuerus loue to Memmia his wife. ] Death were gentle, if he tooke nothyng but that whiche offendeth: but, oh, he hath reaued the better parte of my selfe . How wonderfullie, was the Loue of Paulina , sage Senecaes Wife,   [ Paulinas rare loue, to her Husbande Seneca. ] who opened her Uaines, not onely, with an intent to accompanie him to death, but also, with a desire to feele her Husbandes maner of deathe. Quintus Curtius , resiteth, that Kyng Darius , with an vnapauled Spirit, tooke his Ouerthrowes, by Alexander the Great,   [  The precious loue of king Darius to his wife. ] the ruine of his kingdome, and the daunger of his royall parson: But hauing knowledge of his wiues death, he wept bitterly, shewing by this sorrow, that he lo his Queene, farre aboue his Crowne. King Admetus , being sore sicke, receiued this answer from the Oracle:   [ The deuine loue of king Admetus Wife. ] that if he liued, his best friend must dye: which when the good Queene heard, shee presently slewe her selfe, and in the trembling passage of Death, constantly saide: To giue King Admetus lyfe, his Queene and dearest friende dooth die . Tiberius Graccus ,   [  The exceeding loue of Tiberius Graccus, towards his wife. ] finding two Serpents, in his chamber, went to the Augurers , to know what they deuyned? who answered, that he was bound to kill the one of these two Serpents, if hee slew the Male, he should die himselfe: if hee killed the Female, he should lose his wife: who (murtherer of himselfe) slew the Male, and saued his wife: and so by his rare loue, raised a question, whether his Wyfe were more fortunate in hauinge suche a Husbande, or happye in loosing of him. One of the seuen wonders of the worlde,   [  The wonderfull loue of Queene Artimesia, towards her husbande Mausolus. ] is an eternall testimonie of the loue whiche Queene Artemesia bare to her Husbande Mausolus , who for to engraue his dead coarse, erected a Sepulchre, so royall and sumptuous, as tooke away the glorie of all princely Tumbes, before her time, and lefte no possibilitie, for any (in time to come) to excel the same: but holding this too bace a Mansion, for his Kingly hart,   [  One of the seuen wonders of the worlde. ] she dried the same to powder, & spising her wine there with, she buryed it in her owne bowels: and to crowne his fame, with an euerlasting memorie, for that the ruine of his Sepulcher was subiect to the iniurie of time, with great rewardes she incouraged Theopompus, Teodectes, Naucrites, & [illeg.]ocrates foure of the most famous Orators of Greece , to renowne his vertues.   [  Aul. Gel. in lib. de nocti atti. ] Amonge whom, Theopompus (as we read) receiued the triumph of victorie, in that learned skirmish. I coulde reporte manye other Authoryties, of vnseperable Loue betweene the Married: the least of a hundred whereof, would equall, the friendshippes of TITVS and GISIPPVS : Or of DAMON and PITHIAS , the two woonders of mens affections. But for that I know, the able wittes heere present, can cloth my naked prooffes, of the excellencie of Marriage, and of the deuyne Loue, betweene the Marryed, with manye other sounde reasons, I wil giue place Madam, that you, and the rest of your Ingenious Companie, may doo better seruice to the one, and Iustice to the other, desiring that, that which is saide, may discharge my promisse, though not sattisfy your expectation. Sir (quoth Queene Aurelia ) if you giue vs good lawes to preserue Loue amonge the married as you haue with precious authorities set forth the excellencie of Mariage, & the deuine operations of her blessings, wt a ful performace of your promisse, you shal binde vs al to be your Debters. Madame (quoth Phyloxenus ) you set me to a verie hard taske: the Rose, is Hostesse, as well for the Butterflie as the Bee: the Sunne shineth, both vpon the good and bad: yea, Christe him selfe, was (aswell) Maister to a Theefe, as to a true Disciple: Euen so, diuine Mariage, can not haue, but some Deuillysh Subiectes, whome Examples wil not feare: much lesse, may Lawes, keepe in vnitie. I graunt (quoth Queene Aurelia :) the euyll are fearelesse of the Lawe,   [ The Lawe is a scourge to the euill, and comforte to the good. ] vntyll they be scourged with the vengeaunce therof: but the good embrace Lawes, as their Directors in Uertue, & Defenders from daunger: for whose Benefite, I intreate you now, with as large a power, as I lately commaunded you: that (in this behalfe) you wyl commyt, some counsaylyng Lawes, to our attentiue Memories. Madame (quoth Segnior Phyloxenus, ) to showe that your Uertues, haue as great power to commaund me, as your Aucthorytie to enioyne mee: I wyll set downe my owne Imagynations, to preserue (and multiplye) Loue, peace, wealthe, and Ioye, among the Maried: leauyng the same to be pefected, by the hearers better Iudgementes. Reported, by Segnior Phyloxenus. be many meanes too damne vp the Course of Delight, betweene the Maried, if the Match be not made, aswell, by foresight, as free choyce: The Office of Foresight,   [  Marriage consistes as well in foresight, as free choyce ] is to preuent, folowyng Mischaunces: and (aduisedly to consider, if present Abylytie, wyll support an Householde, and (according to their callyng) leaue a Portion, to their Posterytie. In this point, the experyence of the Parents, is to be preferred before the rashe imaginations of the sonne: for the aged Married, by proofe know, that in time many accidents of mischaunce, will hinder the indeuours of the best husbands. The office of foresight, is likewise to consider,   [  Equallity in yeares. ] of the equallitie in yeares, least the one growing, and the other declining in perfection, after a while, repent, when remedie comes too late: the Rose full blowne, seemeth fayre for a time, but withereth much sooner then the tender Bud. It is the office of foresight,   [  Equallity in manners. ] to consider of the equallitie of bringing vp, least a diuersity in manners, betweene the married, make a deuision of desires: for Spannyels and Curres, hardly liue together without snarling. And it is the office of foresight,   [  Consent in religion. ] to see that there be a consent in Religion, betweene the marryed, for if theyr loue be not grafted in theyr soules, it is like theyr Marriage will be infyrmed, with the defects of the body. The office of Free choise ,   [  Free choise in satisfaction of Fancie. ] is the roote or foundation of Marriage, which consisteth onely in the satisfaction of fancie: for where the fancie is not pleased, all the perfections of the world, cannot force looue, and where the fancie delighteth, many defects are perfected, or tollerated among the Marryed. When Marriage is solemnized, there are many things to be obserued one the parte bothe of the husband and the Wife. The Husband is to consider,   [  A mans house is a pettie common weale. ] his house is a petty Common wealth, whereof himselfe is cheefe, and his Seruaunts Subiects: therefore, for the welfare bothe of himselfe and householde, it is needefull, that he set downe such orders, as God may be gloryfied, himselfe profitably serued, the good seruaunt well rewarded, the euill chastened, and the neighbour pleased: And as it is the Husbands office, to set downe these orders,   [  The office of the Wife. ] so it is the Wiues dutie to see them executed. The charge of the Husband,   [  The husbandes care appertaineth to thinges abroade. ] is to get abroade for the prouision of his householde: and the Wife is bounde to spare at home, towards the maintenance of her children. The office of the Husband, is to see his ground Tilled, his Cattell cherished, his sences sound, his labourers worke, and their wages paide. The dutie of the wife is to see her Garden weeded,   [  The wiues charge is huswiuery within doore. ] her Uines cut, and in her Orcharde her fruite Trees pruned: within doores her house well ordered, her Maidens busied, her Children instructed, the freend intertained, and the Tables well furnished. And in this Oeconmie , many women haue so excelled,   [  Morall Philosophit to be learned by women. ] as Socrates affirmeth: that he learned of Women more Morrall Philosophie, then naturall reason of Anaxagoras and Archelaus : wherein Socrates testifyeth no more then theyr woorthy sexe deserueth: for many Women gouerne theyr Families with such Prudence, Temperance, Pietie, and other commendable vertues, as may well instruct the wisest. The Husband ought to beware,   [  Laciuious talke to be shunned of the husband ] that in the presence of his wife, he vseth no filthie lasciuious talke: for besides the witnesse of his owne indiscression, he maketh her a passage for many an vnhappy thought. The Wife ought to be nice,   [  The wife ought to be nice in cause of suspition. ] in occasion of suspition, for her husband that see'th open cause of mistrust, cannot but feare, that in secret, he receiueth iniurie: and Ielowsie though she proceedes from exceeding loue, yet is she the greatest enemie of the Married. The Husband is bound to keepe his wife in ciuill and comely apparell,   [ Comelye apparell the husband should giue his wife. ] as well to make her seeme beautifull vnto himselfe, as to preuent the reproche of the neighbour: for this hath beene an auncient custome among the Romaines , and it is to be feared, that if the Husband breake, it to spare his Purse, the Wife will repayre it, though she gage her person. The Wife that will please her Husband,   [  Cleane lynnen commendable in a vvife. ] and make a great showe of a little, though her Gownes be plaine, in her lynnen she must be curious and fine: for otherwise, were she attyred all in Silke: if her sleeues, Partlet and other Linnen be coorse, torne, or sluttishly washed, she shall neither be praysed of straungers, nor delight her Husband. The Husband, after householde iarres,   [  The husbad must bevvare of sollomnes. ] if the Wife seeme to be sorie, he ought not to be sullen: for if shee perceiue him of a frowarde nature, it is like in other suche squares, she wilbe negligent to please him. The Wife, if she offend her husband,   [  The vvife must be amyable tovvardes her husband ] by some ignoraunt trespasse, she must please him with a louing countenaunce: least if he finde her of a crooked condition, he will take delight to crosse her with continuall foule vsage. The olde Husband,   [  A lavve for a younge vvomans olde husband. ] is to accompany his young Wife with graue Matrons, and to set her foorth with costly ciuill attyre, that seeing the reuerence and honour that is giuen her for her Husbandes grauitie, she will studdie how to please him, though she displease her owne disposition. The younge Wife that hath an olde Husband,   [  A regarde for an olde mans young vvyfe. ] is bound to make much of him at home: for the reputation she receaueth in his life, and for the wealth she is like to haue by his deathe: and abroade must be sober in her behauiours, discreete in her talke, and no harkener to young mens tales, least her owne lightnesse, make her openly infamed, where her Husbands imperfections, could cause her but to be secreatly suspected. The young Husband is too beare with his olde Wife,   [  A regarde for an olde vvomans younge husband. ] in her will, as well for the reuerence due to her yeares, as for the aduauncement, the loue bringeth to himselfe: least the neighbours terme his Wife an vnfortunate old Woman, and himselfe, a naughtie, frowarde, vile natured young man. The olde Wife, to giue excuse to her dotage,   [  A regard for a young mans olde vvife. ] must in open assemblies, commend her young Husband of modest and staied gouernement: and secreatly, to be louingly vsed, must kisse him: with Midas lippes for, if she fyll not his Purse by fayre meanes, with foule intreatie he will be his owne Caruer: if she complayne, she ioyneth but scorne to her owne mischaunce. Generally,   [  Modest familiaritie not to be forbidden the Wife. ] the Husband ought not to forbid his Wife, in assemblyes modestlie, to intertaine time, in deuising with the better sorte: for in such ielous restraint, he shall leaue a suspition, that he inioyneth her this open pennaunce, for some secret trespasse, and so bothe slaunder himselfe, and iniurie his wife. The Wife should haue an especiall care,   [  Light company to be shunned of the Wife. ] to shun the company of light Women: for the multitude, though they can charge her with no misdemeanour, yet they well condemne her honor, by the known euils of her companions. Many other needefull directions, may be giuen to preserue vnitie in Mariage (quoth Segnior Phyloxenus ) too cumbersome for me to reporte, and too tedious for this honorable company to heere, whose patience I haue already iniured too much: but finding my error, I end my tale, & remaine ready to make satisfactio in some other seruice. Sir (quoth Fabritio ) the end of your Tale, puts vs in remembraunce of our duetie and your right, which is for this honourable fauour, to remaine your indebted Seruaunts, to embrace your counsels, and to commend (and submit our reasons, to) your learned Censure. It is your fauour and not my merit (quoth Segnior Phyloxenus .) Sir, (quoth Queene Aurelia ) I will beare the blame of this dayes importuning of you, and you alone shall haue the honour, in graunting of my requests, who to the former ioyneth this one more fauour, which is, that you conclude this your worthy exercise, with some rare Historie at large. Madam (quoth Segnior Philoxenus ) this is the least of your commaundements, considering that Histories make mention of thousands, who in their vnseperable looues, haue sounded the excellencie of Mariage, wherefore I obey your pleasure. by Segnior Phyloxenus . Cronicled, as presedents for theyr posteritie, I reade, that in the famous Cittie of Miletum in Ionia , as soueraigne Prince and gouernour, there raigned a worthy Duke, called Nebeus , who to comfort and supporte his aged yeares, had to his sonne and onely heayre, Phrigius , a young Gentleman of such rare towardlines, as it may be a question, whether he weare more beholding to Nature for the perfections of his body, to Vertue for the qualities of his minde, or to Fortune in suffering him to be so nobly borne. In Myos , a neighbour Cittie to Miletum , there was also a Prince of much renowne, named Pythes , whose Daughter and heyre, was fayre Pieria , by whose vertues all Ionia was renowned. The auncient enuie betweene the Cittizens of Miletum and Myos , was tourned into amitie: and the open warre betweene Duke Nebeus and the noble Pithes , was peaceably and honourably ended: All such happie euents, succeeded this following aduenture. Upon the Feastiuall day of Diana , the Cittizens of Myos , with out the iniurie of Souldiers, might lawfully repayre to Miletum , to sacrifice to Diana , vpon which safe conduct, with many other Ladyes and Gentlewomen of Myos , fayre Pieria waighted on her Mother to Dianas Temple, whose rare beauty was such, as dazeled the eies of the behoulders, like the reflections of a Myrror, placed against the Sunne. Among many that looued, and few or none that saw possibility of grace, such was the renowne of her chaste disdaine, young Phrigius beheld Pieria with such a setled eye, as Dianas Temple sheelded him not against the Arrowes of Looue: but as a wounded Stag, at the first seemeth little dismayde: so Phrigius with an vnappalled cheere, returned to the Dukes Pallace, and as pledge of truce, he sent his heart to Myos . The Ceremonies and Sacrifices of Diana ended, the Warres renued, the wonted Massacres, Murthers, Rapines, and outragious cruelties practised by the Souldiours of either part: in so much as Lawe gaue place to Armes, equitie to violence, and all publique order was peruerted, and vpon the point to be destroyed. The Captaines of Myos encouraged theyr Souldiours of ye one part: but ye Souldiours of Miletum , were driuen to comfort theyr Captaine wt a threatening of disgrace. But ah poore Phrigius , what aunswer shouldst thou make? To see thy Souldiours slaine, and thy Citties spoyled, without proffers of rescue were dishonourable: to bend thy forces against thy owne heart, were vnnaturall: to make the best choyse of these two euilles, required leasure: and iudgement. And therefore aduisedly to consider of his estate, at this time Phrigius satisfied his Souldiours with hope of some speedy venturous exployte, and daungered not his enemies, with the proffer of any violence: so that either power kept their trenches peaceably, but yet with this indifferent perryll, that they attended oportunitie, to make the one Conquerors, and the other Captiues: for the long Ciuill contention, had now made the estate of either as desperate, as the fortunes of two that haue their substaunce vpon the chaunce of Dice, the one to haue all, the other to be vndoone. When Phrigius had with slender hope thus quieted the acclamations of the people, he retyred himselfe into a solitary Chamber, to be the sole companion of his outragious passions, with whom he thus deuised. Ah trayterous eyes, betrayers of my whole body, the scourge of Miletum , and enymies of my honour: the vengeaunce of Oedippus is too gentle for your iniuries: what doost thou say? oh blasphemous tongue, riuall of humanitie, callumner of Beautie, and hinderer of thy countryes peace: thou reprocher of vertue, and Phrigius welfare: know to thy shame, the perfection of my eyes haue constantly behelde Pieria , whose deuine beauties, emblemed in humaine shape, dazeleth the youngest sight in Ionia : Then to reuile them thus, thou tyrannisiest nature: to demaunde why I loue and serue Beautie , thy question is blinde, and deserueth a double aunswer: But aye me, though my eyes, and Loue, haue doone but what is iust, Fortune hath dealt too rigourously with me, to render my heart Captiue to his Daughter, who is the riuall of my father: what hope may I giue to my afflictions? when possibility of comfort is taken away: the Parents are ready to sheath their Swords in one an others entrayles: is it then like, the Children shall imbrace a mutuall affection? O no: for though mylde Venus consent that they loue, wrathfull Mars wyll seuer theyr affection. O cruell Warre,   [  The vengeaunce of Warre. ] thou art not vnproperly called the scourge of God, for in thee is contayned a greater vengeaunce then might be imagined by man: thou armest the Sonne against the Father, the Uncle against the Nephew, the Subiect against his Soueraigne: Thy Drinke is blood, thy foode the flesh of men: thy Fiers are flaming Citties: thy pleasures, spoyling of Widdowes, rauishment of Uirgins, subuertion of Lawes and publique benefit: thy Iudges, Tyrannie and Iniustice: and where thou remaynest, her knowen enemy is not so daungerous, as the fayned freend. But why exclaime I of Warre, who double Crowned Alexander with the ritches of Asia and Affrica ? who honoured Caesar , with imperiall triumphes? and rewarded Hanniball , for the trauailes of his life, with renowne after death? by whom Millions of men, are regystred in the life Booke of Fame: and thorough whom, Phrigius giueth expectation of benefit vnto his Countrey, comfort to his aged Father, and honour to his posteritie. I receyued my wounde in the tyme of peace, nay in the Temple of Diana : shall I then exclayme of Peace , and vpbrayde Chastitie : fowle fall the heart that should mooue, and shame worme the tongue that pronounceth such blasphemie: O blessed Peace , thou fast chainest Treason, Tirannie, Murther, Theft , and Wrathe , with all disturbers of common tranquillitie, and in the hyest dignities, placest Iustice, Pietie, Temperaunce, Concorde and Loue ,   [  The blessings of peace. ] with many other Mortall vertues, by whom the lewde are chastened, the good are cherished, and Common weales prosper and florish. O Chastitie , thy diuine vertues deserue a better Trumpet, then my iniurious tongue: thy excellencie is written in the browe of Pieria . And is Pieria the Deputie of Diana ? O yes: and Phrigius the seruaunt of Venus ? too true: it is then impossible they should agree in affection? yea sure. O vnfortunate Phrigius , through Peace which receiuedst thy wound, before Dianas Aulter, and by cruell Warre art seperated from the Surgion that should cure thee. These sundrye conflictes Phrigius had with his bitter passions, which pursued theyr aduantage, with such thorny feares, as if he had not beene suddenly succoured, by the aduise and comfort of Lorde Miletus , a fauoured Counseller to Duke Nebeus , & an assured freend to his sonne Phrigius , he had beene like to haue yeelded to Dispaire. Miletus was glad to see him thus affected and sorry to behold him so daungerouslie afflicted: for in this looue he foresawe an end, of the auncient enuie and enmitie, betweene the Cittizens of Miletum , and Myos : whose ciuill Fraies, had buried more young men in the Fieldes, then aged in the Churches and Churchyardes. Therefore to confirme his affection, and to comfort him with hope: Lord Phrigius quoth he, to blame your affection were cruelty & no sound counsell: for you loue Pieria , the Parragon of the worlde, to discomfort you with an impossibilitie of her fauour, were cleane against the possibilitie of your fortune: for besides that, your person alluringly pleaseth, your authorities commaund: yea Pithes cannot but reioyce, Pieria consent, and all Myos desire is to solemnize this Mariage. My selfe, and the grauer sort of the counsell, will motion the matter to the Duke your father, who I trust wil holde the affection of his sonne, rather to proceede from the iustice of Diana , then the iniurie of Cupid . Who regarding the zelous offeringes of Pieria , agreed that you shoulde be wounded, that Pieria might haue the honour to cure you, in whose vertues, all Ionia hopeth to be blessed. Therefore, to make your affection knowen, in some pleasing Letter, to Pieria commend your seruice, and to deale with both your fathers, refer the care to mee: How sweete the smallest hope of grace is to a condemned man? or the leaste woorde of comfort, from the Phisition, to the infirmed patient: the soden chaunge of Phrigius mone, truely manifesteth: who nowe began to looke cheerefully, and with hope appeased his passions: so that imbrasing Miletus , he committed his life to the fortune of his discresion: and while his passion was quicke, hee presented both loue and seruice to Pieria , in this following letter. affection, let it not seeme strange, that I am slaue to your bewtie, nor wounder though I sue for grace. The wounded Lion, prostrateth himselfe at the feete of a man: the sicke, complayneth, to the Phisition: and (charged with more tormentes) the louer, is inforced to seeke comfort of his Mistresse. To proue that I loue, needeth no other testimony the the witnes of your rare perfectios,  & to giue me life is the only work of your pittie. Wherfore [Madame] since the Vertue of your eye, hath drawen away my heart, as the Adamant doeth the steele, I beseech you that my hartlesse bodie may so liue by your ruth, as I may haue strength (as well as wil) to do you seruice: & let it suffice for more honor of your tryumph, that by the power of beutie, your vertues haue achiued, a more glorious conquest, then might the whole strength of MYOS, and whiche is more, of a puissant enemie, you haue made so perfect a friende, as Phrygius, shal hold him self in no fortune, so happie, as to encounter with the oportunytie, to do Pieria, and her fauourers seruice, or their enemies damage: If which amendes, may repayre all Iniuries past, I shall hould, the Safecundict blessed, that licensed you to enter Myletum: If greater ransom be demauded, it must be my life: which [if it be your wyl] shall foorth with be sacrificed, notwithstandinge, in such crueltie, Dianas Temple shalbe prophaned, before whose Aulter, I receiued my wound from the eyes of fayre Pieria: but houldynge it vnpossible, that a stonie harte, may bee enemie to so manye Graces as liue in your face: I Balme my woundes, with hope that I kisse your gracious hand: and that your Aunswere wyll returne an acceptaunce of seruice. He, whose hart waighteth on your beautie. PHRIGIVS. This Letter sealed & subscribed: To fayre Pieria, Tryumph after victorie : was deliuered vnto a trustie Messenger: who (hauing Safecunduict, to passe through both the Armies) in good houre, arriued at Prince Pythes , Pallace: and in the presence of her Mother & other friends reuerently kissyng the same, deliuered Pieria , wt Phrygius louyng commendations, his letter. Who so in ye Spryngtime, in one Momet had seene rayne and Sunshine, might againe beholde the lyke chaunge in Pierias troubled countenaunce: who found no lesse Ioye in reading the Letter, then cause of wonder, in beholding the superscriptio, who (by the consent of Diana , to bring peace into Myletu ) was by loue, with the selfe same Arrowe, & at one instant wouded in as deepe Affection, as Phrygius : notwithstandynge, bounde to no desire so muche, as to the Direction of her Parentes, she shewed them this Letter: who weerie of the warres: and embracynge this meane of peace. After they had aduisedly considered the Contentes: to comforte Phrygius , without iniurie to Pieriaes chaste behauiour in her name, they returned this Aunswere. prayses, so far passe my meryt, as I wunder at the errour of your Iudgement: so, I doubt whither so honourable a personage, as your Lordship, can yeelde your seruice, to so meane a Lady: or if loue were of that power, whether you woulde obay, to bee Seruante to her, whose Fathers ryuall, your parentes, and you are: but on the other part: I entertayne a faint hope, that you are not so much enemie to your honor, as to leaue in your Aduersaries possession, a Monument of Dissimulation: Vpon which warant, and your free offer of seruice: I bind you, by a curtuous request, to indeuour to conclude a speedie peace: that I may without danger of Hostliyty repaire to Dianas Temple: In copassyng of which gratious League, you shal receiue great glory: the countrey much quiet, and I, whom you wysh such welfare, shalbe bownd to do you any honourable fauour. PIERIA of MYOS. This aunswer sealed, and subscribed, To my Lorde Phrygius : delyuered by the handes, and blessed with the louing countenaunce of Pieria , was returned to Phrigius , by his owne messenger: who, after hee had read and reread this Letter (not for that, the Contents, gaue him any assuraunce of Loue: but for because, they commaunded an imployment of Seruice) hee comforted his Spirit, with hope, that his indeuour in this charge, shoulde, both reaue all doubte, of dissimulation, by hym, and smoothe Pierias Browe, of Chaste disdayne: and to further a happy ende of the Countries calamitie. In the beginnyng of Phrigius contentment, Lorde Miletus had so dealt in these affaires, as in shorte time Duke Nebeus , and Prince Pythes came to parle of peace: and while the Counsels of either parte, considered vppon the Articles of agreement: Safecundit of Trafick, was geuen to the Inhabitants of either Citie. How sweete the friendly incounters, of these aunciente enemies were: is the office of him, that hath beene scourged with warres: who, though they were but in the estate of repriued men, yet the hope of assured peace lightned their hartes of former sorrowe,   [  The vertue of Peace. ] and replenished the place with gladnesse. Faire Pieria , nowe safely repaired to the Aulters of Diana : and Phrygius , more of desire, to salute his Mistris, then of zeale to sacrifice, to Chastetie: fayned many Deuotions, to visit her Temple: where these Louers, for the reuerence they bare to the place, forbare to encounter in any speeche of Loue: Yet if Diana , wolde haue publyshed their thoughts, shee shoulde haue confessed, that the most deuotionate of them both, in their hartes, honoured Iuno , in the eye of her owne Image and Aulters. But Diana , though shee be the Soueraigne of single Nimphes: yet is she friende to Iuno , and ye Chast Married: and only enemie, to Venus and the wanton sort: so that shee tooke in worth, this light trespasse: yea, held her self honoured, that her sacred Temple, should bee the originall cause of Myletum and Myos , peace and amytie: and the ende of their auncient enuy, and enmitie. Wherfore, to conclude, the begun agreement, she sent Concorde and Charitie, to chayne vp Grudge, and Dissention. Duke Nebeus and Prince Pythes , freed from the vexation of these furies, with affable and friendly intertainment, reasoned of their affayres: and while the Parents parled of their common profit: the Children, vppon lawfull oportunities, deuysed of their pryuate Loues: but yet with suche a dutifull regarde, of their friendes consent, that although their hartes were lynked together, by free choyce, the clapping of hands was referred to the forsight of Parentes: who burying former iniuries, in the Caue of Obliuion, made an Edict of Amyty, sealed, & strengthned, with the Marriage of Phrygius and Pieria , Heires of eithers renowne and dignytie.   [  The power of vertuous Loue. ] Beholde heere the worke of Loue, grafted in the honorable hartes of the vertuous. The wrath and stormes of war, is turned to calm & temporate peace: ye blossoms of enmytie are altered into fruts of amyty: and the roote of mallice, grown to ye tree of pitie. The Nobles in honour of this Mariage, lauisht out their treasure, in all their triumphes and showes to be in good equipage. The meaner Gentlemen, by exceeding cost, learned by experience, how afterwarde to spare. The Citizens with giftes of great Emprice, presented their dutiful affections. The learned eternised this marriage peace, in Tables of Memorie. The Cleargy song Himnes of ioy, The common people ronge the Belles, and euerie sorte showed some token of delight. So that Phrigius and Pieria , after the deathes of their aged fathers were crowned with the dignities of Myletum and Myos , and all their happie life, were honoured with these acclamations of their subiectes. Liue, blessed Princes: the appeasers of Iupiters wrathe, by whome War, the Monster of humanitie, is fast chayned: And peace the soueraigne of morall vertues, Triumpheth in the Capitals of IONIA Liue blessed princes, and long enioye the heartes of your subiectes. In your vertues who haue multiplied wealth: and to doe you seruice are readie to spende their liues . This zeale and reuerence of their subiectes, Phrigius and Pieria , manie yeares possessed, betweene whome there was such equallitie in disposition, as fortune knew not, by anie accident of ioye, or mischance, howe to seuer their desires. And when the time came, that the heauens (enuying the glorie of the earth, in possessing this diuine cupple charged nature, to render their right. Who obaying the will of Ioue, sent sickenes to summon both Phrigius , and Pieria , and licensed death to doe his worst. And (as there yet remaineth an opinion in Miletum ) as their loues began in one houre, so their liues ended in one momente: whose spirites Metamorphosed , into white Turtles, tooke their flight, towardes that heauenly Paradise. Where I wish all faithfull louers, and this louely companie, abiding places. Segnior Philoxenus , by the vertue of this dayes exercise, the onely trauell of his learned wit, so raysed the heartes of the companie, with the desire of Mariage, that Lucia Bella , who, in the beginning of Christmasse, was determyned to haue beene a vestall Nunne, now confessed that they were enemies to Nature, & not worthy the society of men, which scandylised, or scorned this sacred Institution. The rest of this honorable company, by plawsible speeches, confirmed Lucia Bellas opinion, or by silence shewed a willyng consent. And to conclude the exercise, ([quoth] Queene Aurelia,) Segnior Philoxenus , your sweet vertues, haue described so deuyne a Paradice, as our soules cannot, but long, after this holy Institution, & our hartes honour your perfections, by whose bountie this company is not onely highly intertained, but by your most precious treasures richly inriched. Madam ([quoth] hee) ye vertue you speake of, belongeth to Mariage: ye benefit to this gracious assembly: & the bare words, to Phyloxenus . Such bare wordes ([quoth] Fabritio ) deserue to be registred amonge the lyfe deeds of Memorie. Upon this Iudgment, Queene Aurelia , arose, & the company performyng the office of reuerent curtesy, returned into the great Chamber to salute some other of the New yeeres Pleasures. Segnior PHILOXENVS, to honoure Queene AVRELIA, & the other Ladies and Gentlewomen. Vppon Newe yeeres daye at Night, about nine of the Clocke, in an inclosed place in the great Hall: after Queene Aurelia , & her chosen attendants, had daunced certein solemne Almaynes appeared a hye Mountain, the Forestery wherof, was of faire Bay Trees, Pomgranate, Lymons, Orenges, Date Trees , and other fruites of most pleasure: among the Mossy Rocks appeared Snailes, Lysards, Moles, Frogs, Greshoppers , & such lyke vnuenymus vermin, and by the fountaines, which run aslant the side of ye Mountain, Lions, Vnicorns, Elephats, Camelios, Camels & other beasts of honor: as if they were appointed by Nature, to garde those sacred streames, fro being troubled wt the raskall multitude of Cattel, which domesticall desart, was perfected wt such art, as nature cofessed her excellent cuning, to be vanquished by mans industrie. This Mountaine which resembled, some wildernes in Arabia , dewed wt ye pleasant springes of Africa , by a still motion, remoued towards ye vpper end of ye hall, into ye ful presence of Queene Aurelia , & the most statly company. In ye mydst of this Mountaine was an Arbor of sweete Eglentine , intercoursed wt Roses , and fully shadowed wt the spreadinge Branches, of ye purpled Vine : in which, vpo a statly throne sate Diana attired all in whyte, and at her feete weare the nyne Muses , clothed in seuerall colours, according to their seueral qualyties, sounding heauenly harmony, both with voice & instrument: out of this arbor sprang a Bay Tree , in which was the Hyen , which at pleasure being both Male & Female, expressed ye ful power of vertue: who though shee hath ye forme & habit of a woman, yet is her essentiall substance compounded of both kindes: At the foote of this Hil, was ye Monster Enuy armed wt fire & sword, to hinder their passage, which aduetred to clime ye Mount: a forest Nimph clad all in flowers, in a short speech, declared, yt Diana , & ye Muses, who in the golden age, had their Pallaces, in the Forrests, Mountaines, & riuers of pleasure, through out ye whole world: now by ye iniury of time, were driue to their sanctuary of Parnassus : at ye foote wherof the Monster Enuy kept, to hinder ye passages of such as attempted wt their renown, to set those Ladies at lyberty: who hering by fame, ye glory of this honorable company, were ariued by hope, yt ye vertu of some of ye troupe, should redeeme the from captiuytie, & therfore, she sumoned ye Knightes present, to make tryall of their vallors, & ye Ladies of their vertues: whiche saide, she retired back into ye Mountaine: The Gentlemen & Ladies, hauing a cuning foreknowlege of ye intet of this show armed themselues, wt sundry attempts to ouercome this Monster. Soranso, Dondolo, Ismarito, & Faliero , drew their rapiers, & assailed Enuy, but dry blowes auailed not: so yt they were conquered, & comitted to ye gayle of Tediusnesse. Maria Belochy, Franceschina Sancta, Lucia Bella, Helena Dulce , and other Ladies, and Damosels, indeuored to charme hym, wt the sweete sounds, and Heauenlye impressions of Musick. But Enuy more warie then Argus , and lesse pitifull then ye Tormenters of Hell: the first whereof, was ouercome with Inachus Oten Pipe: the other moued to ruthe with Orpheus passionate Musick (to show himselfe composed of all the vennom of Hell) coulde not bee conquered, by the sharp swords of the Knightes, nor would not be intreated with the sugred Harmonie of the faier Ladies: But amidst this Monsters Triumphes, there was a voyce heard in the Mowntayne: Non vi, sed virtute : Whervpon, Queene Aurelia , with a Myrrour, deuised by Segnior Philoxenus , peaceably, made towards Enuie : whiche Monster, presumyng of his force, lifted his Club against this vertuous Dame: who, by the reflections of the Concaue Superficies , of this Myrrour, daunted with the feare of his own weapon, imagining that he stroke him selfe, recoyled backe with such haste, as he fell downe: Whervpon, Segnior Phyloxenus , seasyng on his Club,   [  Enuy is murdered with his owne wepon. ] and laying him on, therwith, said: As Phallaris, dyd to Perillus: die with the weapon, thou preparst for other . In Trumph of this glorious Uictorie, Diana sent down the Nymphe Chlora , to salute Queene Aurelia , with this Present: which was a Shield, wherin was quartred, four seuerall Honours. The first. VERT : A lookyng Glasse of Christall . The second. AZVRE : a payre of Ballance, Argent , The thyrd. OR : a Pyller of Porphier . The fourth. Argent : a standing Cup of Ruby Rock . The Muses them selues, came also downe, and crowned her with a Garland of Roses, parted, perpale, ARGENT, and Gvles : and electing her for their Soueraign, to comfort the fiue Knights that were discoforted by ENVY, two  & two leading a Knight, between the, daunced a statly Almain, of XV. which ended: thei bestowed a fauor, & certain Latin verses, vpo euery one of the Knights: & returned vnto their Mount.
