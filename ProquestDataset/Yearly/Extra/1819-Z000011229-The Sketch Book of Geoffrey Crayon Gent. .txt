Look out nobly, then, and dare Even the fetters that you wear. Fletcher . On a soft sunny morning, in the month of May, I made an excursion to Windsor, to visit the castle. It is a proud old pile, stretching its irregular walls and massive towers along the brow of a lofty ridge, waving its royal banner in the clouds, and looking down with a lordly air upon the surrounding world. It is a place that I love to visit, for it is full of storied and poetical associations. On this morning, the weather was of that soft vernal kind that calls forth the latent romance of a man's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] temperament, and makes him quote poetry, and dream of beauty. In wandering through the magnificent saloons and long echoing galleries of the old castle, I felt myself most disposed to linger in the chamber where hang the portraits of the beauties that once flourished in the gay court of Charles the Second. As I traversed the "large green courts," with sunshine beaming on the gray walls, and glancing along the velvet turf, I called to mind the tender, the gallant, but hapless Surrey's account of his loiterings about them in his stripling days, when enamoured of the Lady Geraldine--- "With eyes cast up unto the maiden's tower, With easie sighs, such as men draw in love." But the most interesting object of my visit was the ancient keep of the castle, where James the First of Scotland, the pride and theme of Scottish poets and historians, was for many years of his youth detained a prisoner of state. It is a huge gray tower, that has stood the brunt of ages, and is still in good [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] preservation. A great flight of steps leads to the interior. In the armoury, a Gothic hall filled with weapons of various kinds, is still shown hanging against the wall, a suit of armour that once belonged to James. From hence a staircase conducts to a suite of apartments of faded magnificence, hung with gobelin tapestry, which formed James's prison. The whole history of this amiable but unfortunate prince is highly romantic, and too well known to need particular relation. At the tender age of eleven he was sent from home by his father, Robert III., and destined for the French court, to be reared under the eye of the French monarch, secure from the treachery and danger that surrounded the royal house of Scotland. It was his mishap in the course of his voyage, to fall into the hands of the English, and he was detained prisoner by Henry IV., notwithstanding that a truce existed between the two countries. The intelligence of his capture, coming in the train of many sorrows and disasters, proved [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] fatal to his unhappy father. "The news," we are told, "was brought to him while at supper, and did so overwhelm him with grief, that he was almost ready to give up the ghost into the hands of the servants that attended him. But being carried to his bed chamber, he abstained from all food, and in three days died of hunger and grief, at Rothesay." [1] James was detained in captivity for eighteen years; but, though deprived of personal liberty, he was treated with the respect due to his rank. Care was taken to instruct him in all the branches of useful knowledge cultivated at that period, and to give him those mental and personal accomplishments deemed proper for a prince. Perhaps, in this respect, his imprisonment was an advantage, as it enabled him to apply himself the more exclusively to his improvement, and quietly to imbibe that rich fund of knowledge, and to cherish those elegant tastes, which have given such a lustre [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] to his memory. The picture drawn of him in early life, by the Scottish historians, is highly captivating, and seems rather the description of a hero of romance, than a character in real history. He was well learnt, we are told, "to fight with the sword, to joust, to tournay, to wrestle, to sing and dance; he was an expert mediciner, right crafty in playing both of lute and harp and sundry other instruments of musick, and was expert in grammar, oratory, and poetry." [2] With this combination of manly and delicate accomplishments, fitting him to shine both in active and elegant life, and calculated to give him an intense relish for joyous existence, it must have been a severe trial, in an age of bustle and chivalry, to pass the spring time of his years in monotonous captivity. It was the good fortune of James, however, to be gifted with a powerfully poetic fancy, and to be visited in his prison by the choicest inspira [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] tions of the muse. Some minds corrode, and grow inactive, under the loss of personal liberty; others, morbid and irritable; but it is the nature of the poet to become tender and imaginative in the loneliness of confinement. He banquets upon the honey of his own thoughts, and, like the captive bird, pours forth his soul in melody. Have you not seen the nightingale A pilgrim coop'd into a cage, How doth she chant her wonted tale, In that her lonely hermitage! Even there her charming melody doth prove That all her boughs are trees, her cage a grove. [3] Indeed, it is the divine attribute of the imagination, that it is irrepressible, unconfinable--- That when the real world is shut out, it can create a world for itself, and, with a necromantic power, can conjure up glorious shapes and forms, and brilliant visions, to make solitude populous, and irradiate the gloom of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] dungeon. Such was the world of pomp and pageant that lived around Tasso in his dismal cell at Ferrara, when he conceived the splendid scenes of his Jerusalem; and we may consider the "King's Quair," [4] composed by James during his captivity at Windsor, as another of those beautiful breakings forth of the soul from the restraint and gloom of the prison house. The subject of the poem is his love for the Lady Jane Beaufort, daughter of the Earl of Somerset. He saw her, accidentally, from the window of his prison, and fell in love with her, in the true spirit of poetry and romance. The poem is a rich effusion of feeling and fancy; full of the descriptive vein which characterizes the poetry of that day, and sobered and sweetened by the most simple and natural reflections. James flourished nearly about the time of Chaucer and Gower, and was evidently a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] studier and admirer of their writings. Indeed, in one of his stanzas he acknowledges them as his masters; and, in some parts of his poem, he seems almost to have borrowed from his prototypes. There are always, however, general features of resemblance in the works of contemporary authors, that are not so much borrowed from each other as from the times. Writers, like bees, toll their sweets in the wide world; they incorporate with their own conceptions the anecdotes and thoughts which are current in society, and thus each generation has some features in common, characteristic of the age in which it lived. What gives peculiar value to the poem of James is, that it may be considered a transcript of the royal bard's true feelings, and the story of his real loves and fortunes. It is not often that sovereigns write poetry, or that poets deal in fact. It is gratifying to the pride of a common man, to find a monarch thus suing, as it were, for admission into his closet, and seeking to win his favour by administering to his pleasures. It is a proof of the honest [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] equality of intellectual competition, which strips off all the trappings of factitious dignity, brings the candidate down to a level with his fellow men, and obliges him to depend on his own native powers for distinction. It is curious, too, to get at the history of a monarch's heart, and find the simple affections of human nature throbbing under the ermine. But James had learnt to be a poet before he was a king: he was schooled in adversity, and reared in the company of his own thoughts. Monarchs have seldom time to parley with their hearts, or meditate their minds into poetry; and had James been brought up amidst the adulation and gayety of a court, we should never have had such a poem as the Quair. In his first canto he makes several allusions to his misfortunes, and his wearisome imprisonment. They are extremely natural and touching; and, perhaps, are rendered more touching by their simple brevity. They contrast finely with those elaborate and iterated complaints which we sometimes meet in poetry, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] effusions of morbid minds sickening under miseries of their own creating, and venting their bitterness on an unoffending world. James speaks of his privations with acute sensibility; but, having mentioned them, passes on, as if his manly mind disdained to brood over unavoidable calamities. When such a spirit breaks forth into complaint, we are aware how great must be the suffering that extorts the murmur. We sympathize with James, a romantic, active, and accomplished prince, cut off in the lustihood of youth from all the enterprise and noble uses of life, as we do with Milton, alive to all the beauties of nature and glories of art, when he breathes forth brief, but deep-toned lamentations, over his perpetual blindness. From a passage in the first canto, we find, that the favourite book of James, while in prison, was Boetius' Consolations of Philosophy, a work popular among the writers of that day, and which had been translated by his great predecessor, Chaucer. And, indeed, it would be difficult to find, out of the sacred writings, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] more admirable text book for meditation under misfortune. It is the legacy of a noble and enduring spirit, purified by sorrow and suffering, bequeathing to all its successors in calamity the stores of eloquent but simple reasoning, by which it was enabled to bear up against the various ills of life. It is a talisman which the unfortunate may treasure up in his bosom, or, like the good King James, lay it on his nightly pillow. At what period of his durance he fell in love with the Lady Jane is uncertain, but from that moment it is probable he "hung up philosophy," and became poetical. The description of his first seeing her is picturesque, and given with great beauty of detail. He was in the midst of one of his fits of lonely weariness, despairing, as he says, of all joy and remedy. "For--- tired of thought, and wo-begone," he wandered to the window to watch the passers by, and gaze out upon the world---the poor solace of the captive. The window looked forth upon a small garden which lay at the foot of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] tower. It was a quiet sheltered spot, adorned with arbours and green alleys, and protected from the passing gaze by trees and hawthorn hedges. Now was there made fast by the towers wall A garden faire, and in the corners set An arbour green, with wandis long and small Railed about, and so with trees beset Was all the place, and hawthorn hedges knet, That lyf [5] was none walkyng there forbye, That might within scarce any wight espye. So thick the beuis  and the leves grene Beshaded all the alleys that there were, And midst of every arbour might be seen The sharp, grene, sweet juniper Growing so fair with branches here and there, That as it seemed to a lyf without The boughs did spread the arbour all about. And on the small grene twistis  sat The lytil suete nyghtingales and sung So loud and clere, the hymnis consecrate Of luvis use, now soft, now loud among, That all the garden and the wallis rong Ryght of their song--- It was in the month of May, when every thing was in its bloom. As he gazes on the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] scene, and listens to the notes of the birds, he gradually lapses into one of those tender and undefinable reveries, that fill the youthful bosom in this delicious season. He wonders what this love may be, of which he has so often read, and which thus seems breathed forth in the quickening breath of May, and melting all nature into ecstacy and song. If it really be so great a felicity, and if it be a boon thus generally dispensed to the most insignificant of beings, why is he alone cut off from its enjoyments? Oft would I think, O Lord, what may this be? That love is of so noble myght and kynde, Loving his folk, and such prosperitee Is it of him, as we in bukis find, May he oure hertes setten and unbynd: Hath he upon our hertes such maistrye? Or is all this but feyuit fantasye? For giff he be of so grete excellence, That he of every wight hath cure and charge, What have I gilt to him, or done offense? That I am thral'd, and birdis go at large. In the midst of his musing, as he cast his eyes downward, he beheld, he says, "the fairest [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] and the freschest young floure" that ever he had seen. It was the beautiful Lady Jane, walking in the garden. She at once captivated the fancy of the romantic prince---became the object of his wishes---the sovereign of his ideal world. There is in all this charming scene a similarity to the early part of Chaucer's Knight's tale, where Palamon and Arcite fall in love with Emilia, whom they see walking in the garden of their prison. But perhaps the very similarity of the actual fact to the poetical incident which he had read, may have induced James to have dwelt upon it in his poem. His description of the Lady Jane is more elaborate than Chaucer's of Emilia. He dwells, with the fondness of a lover, on every article of her apparel, even to the "goodly chain of small orfeverye" [6] about her neck, whereby there hung a ruby in shape of a heart, that seemed, he says, like a spark of fire burning upon her white bosom. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] In her was youth, beautee, with humble port, Bountee, richesse, and womanly feature, (God better wote than my pen can reporte) Wisdome, largesse estate, and cunning sure, In every point, so guided her mesure, In word, in deed, in shape, in countenance, That nature might no more her child advance. Whether this was really the manner in which James first saw the lady of his heart, or whether it is a mere poetical fiction, it is fruitless to conjecture. Do not let us always distrust what is picturesque and romantic, as incompatible with real life; but sometimes take a poet at his word. I find I am insensibly swelling this story beyond my original intention, and must bring it to a close. James, though unfortunate in the general tenor of his life, was more happy in his love than is generally the lot of poets. When at length he was released from his tedious captivity, and restored to his crown, he espoused the Lady Jane, who made him a most tender and devoted wife. She was the faithful sharer of his joys and his troubles; and when, after a brief, but memorable, reign [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] of thirteen years, he was barbarously murdered by his own relatives at Perth, she interposed her body to shield him from harm, and was repeatedly wounded by the sword of the assassin. It was the recollection of this romantic tale of former times, and of the golden little poem that had its birthplace in this tower, that made me visit the old pile with such lively interest. The suit of armour, richly gilt and embellished, as if to figure in the tournay, brought the image of the romantic prince vividly before my imagination. I paced the deserted chambers where he had composed his poem.---I looked out upon the spot where he had first seen the Lady Jane. It was in the same genial month---every thing was bursting into vegetation, and budding forth the tender promise of the year. Time seems to have passed lightly over this little scene of poetry and love, and to have withheld his desolating hand. Several centuries have gone by, yet the garden still flourishes at the foot of the tower. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] The arbours, it is true, have disappeared, yet the place is still sheltered, blooming, and retired. There is a charm about a spot that has once been printed by the footsteps of departed beauty, and hallowed by the inspirations of the poet, that is heightened, rather than impaired, by the lapse of ages. It is, indeed, the gift of poetry to consecrate every place in which it moves; to breathe around nature an odour more exquisite than the perfume of the rose, and to shed over it a tint more magical than the blush of morning. Others may speak of the illustrious deeds of James, as a warrior and a legislator; but I have delighted to view him as the benefactor of the human heart, stooping from his high estate to sow the sweet flowers of poetry and song in the paths of common life. He did all in his power to soften and refine the spirit of his countrymen. He wrote many poems which are now lost to the world. He improved the national music; and traces of his tender and elegant taste may be found in those witching airs still piped [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] among the wild mountains and lonely glens of Scotland. He has thus embalmed his memory in song, and floated it down to after ages, in the rich stream of Scottish melody. All these things were kindling at my heart as I paced the silent scene of his imprisonment. I have visited Vaucluse with as much enthusiasm as a pilgrim would visit the shrine at Loretto; but I never felt more poetical devotion, than when contemplating the old tower and the little garden at Windsor.

There are few places more favourable to the study of character than an English country Church. I was once passing a few weeks at the seat of a friend, who resided in the vicinity of one, the appearance of which particularly struck my fancy. It was one of those rich morsels of quaint antiquity which give such a peculiar charm to English landscape. It stood in the midst of a county filled with ancient [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] families, and contained, within its cold and silent aisles, the congregated dust of many noble generations. The interior walls were encrusted with monuments of every age and style. The light streamed through windows dimmed with armorial bearings, richly emblazoned in stained glass. In various parts of the church were tombs of knights, and high-born dames, of gorgeous workmanship, with their effigies in coloured marble. On every side, the eye was struck with some instance of aspiring mortality; some haughty memorial which human pride had erected over its kindred dust, in this temple of the most humble of all religions. The congregation was composed of the neighbouring people of rank, who sat in pews sumptuously lined and cushioned, furnished with richly-gilded prayer books, and decorated with their arms upon the pew doors---the villagers and peasantry, who filled the back seats, and a small gallery beside the organ---and the poor of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] the parish, who were ranged on benches in the aisles. The service was performed by a snuffling, well fed, vicar, who had a snug dwelling near the church. He was a privileged guest at all the tables of the neighbourhood, and had been the keenest fox-hunter in the county, until age, and good living, had disabled him from doing any thing more than ride to see the hounds throw off, and make one at the hunting dinner. Under the ministry of such a pastor, I found it impossible to get into the train of thought suitable to the time and place; so, having, like many other feeble christians, compromised with my conscience, by laying the sin of my own delinquency at the threshold of another, I occupied myself by making observations on my neighbours. I was as yet a stranger in England, and curious to notice the manners of its fashionable classes. I found, as usual, that there was the least pretension where there was the most [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] acknowledged title to respect. I was particularly struck, for instance, with the family of a nobleman of high rank, consisting of several sons and daughters. Nothing could be more simple and unassuming than their appearance. They generally came to church in the plainest equipage, and often on foot. The young ladies would stop and converse, in the kindest manner, with the peasantry, caress the children, and listen to the stories of the humble cottagers. Their countenances were open, beautifully fair, with an expression of high refinement, but, at the same time, a frank cheerfulness, and engaging affability. Their brothers were tall, and elegantly formed. They were dressed fashionably, but simply; with strict neatness and propriety, but without any mannerism or foppishness. Their whole demeanour was easy and natural, with that lofty grace, and noble frankness, which bespeak free-born souls that have never been checked in their growth by feelings of inferiority. There is a healthful hardiness about real dignity, that never dreads contact [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] and communion with others, however humble. It is only spurious pride that is morbid and sensitive, and shrinks from every touch. I was pleased to see the manner in which they would converse with the peasantry about those rural concerns and field sports, in which the gentlemen of this country so much delight. In these conversations, there was neither haughtiness on the one part, nor servility on the other; and you were only reminded of the difference of rank by the habitual respect of the peasant. In contrast to these, was the family of a wealthy citizen, who had amassed a vast fortune, and, having purchased the estate and mansion of a ruined nobleman in the neighbourhood, was endeavouring to assume all the style and dignity of an hereditary lord of the soil. The family always came to church en prince . They were rolled majestically along in a carriage emblazoned with arms. The crest glittered in silver radiance from every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed. A fat coachman in a three-cornered hat, richly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] laced, and a flaxen wig, curling close around his rosy face, was seated on the box, with a sleek Danish dog beside him. Two footmen in gorgeous liveries, with huge bouquets, and gold-headed canes, lolled behind. The carriage rose and sunk on its long springs with peculiar stateliness of motion. The very horses champed their bits, arched their necks, and glanced their eyes more proudly than common horses, either because they had got a little of the family feeling, or were reined up more tightly than ordinary. I could not but admire the style with which this splendid pageant was brought up to the gate of the church yard. There was a vast effect produced at the turning of an angle of the wall. A great cracking of the whip; straining and scrambling of the horses; glistening of harness, and flashing of wheels through gravel. This was the moment of triumph and vain glory to the coachman. The horses were urged and checked until they were fretted into a foam. They threw out their feet in a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] prancing trot, dashing about pebbles at every step. The crowd of villagers sauntering quietly to church, opened precipitately to the right and left, gaping in vacant admiration. On reaching the gate, the horses were pulled up with a suddenness that produced an immediate stop, and almost threw them on their haunches. There was an extraordinary hurry of the footmen to alight, open the door, pull down the steps, and prepare every thing for the descent on earth of this august family. The old citizen would first emerge his round red face from out the door, looking about him with the pompus air of a man accustomed to rule on change, and shake the stock market with a nod. His consort, a fine, fleshy, comfortable dame, followed him. There seemed, I must confess, but little pride in her composition. She was the picture of broad, honest, vulgar enjoyment. The world went well with her; and she liked the world. She had fine clothes, a fine house, a fine carriage, fine children, every thing was fine about her: it was nothing but driving about, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] and visiting and feasting. Life was to her a perpetual revel; it was one long lord mayor's day. Two daughters succeeded to this goodly couple. They certainly were handsome, but there was a supercilious air, that chilled admiration, and disposed the spectator to be critical. They were ultra-fashionables in dress, and, though no one could deny the richness of their decorations, yet their appropriateness might be questioned amidst the simplicity of a country church. They descended loftily from the carriage, and moved up the line of peasantry with a step that seemed dainty of the soil it trod on. They cast an excursive glance around, that passed coldly over the burly faces of the peasantry, until they met the eyes of the nobleman's family, when their countenances immediately brightened into smiles, and they made the most profound and elegant courtesies; which were returned in a manner that showed they were but slight acquaintances. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] I must not forget the two sons of this aspiring citizen, who came to church in a dashing curricle, with outriders. They were arrayed in the extremity of the mode, with all that pedantry of dress which marks the man of questionable pretensions to style. They kept entirely by themselves, eyeing every one askance that came near them, as if measuring his claims to respectability; yet they were without conversation, except the exchange of an occasional cant phrase. They even moved artificially, for their bodies, in compliance with the caprice of the day, had been disciplined into the absence of all ease and freedom. Art had done every thing to accomplish them as men of fashion, but nature had denied them the nameless grace. They were vulgarly shaped, like men formed for the common purposes of life, and had that air of supercilious assumption which is never seen in the true gentleman. I have been rather minute in drawing the pictures of these two families, because I considered them specimens of what is often to be met with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] in this country---the unpretending great, and the arrogant little. I have no respect for titled rank, unless it be accompanied by true nobility of soul; but I have remarked, in all countries where these artificial distinctions exist, the very highest classes are always the most courteous and unassuming. Those who are well assured of their own standing, are least apt to trespass on that of others; whereas, nothing is so offensive as the aspirings of vulgarity, which thinks to elevate itself by humiliating its neighbour. As I have brought these families into contrast, I must notice their behaviour in church. That of the nobleman's family was quiet, serious, and attentive. Not that they appeared to have any fervour of devotion, but rather a respect for sacred things, and sacred places, inseparable from good breeding. The others, on the contrary, were in a perpetual flutter and whisper; they betrayed a continual consciousness of finery, and a sorry ambition of being the wonders of a rural congregation. The old gentleman was the only one really attentive to the service. He took the whole [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] burden of family devotion upon himself; stood bolt upright, and uttered the responses with a loud voice that might be heard all over the church. It was evident that he was one of those thorough church and king men, who connect the idea of devotion and loyalty; who consider the deity, some how or other, of the government party, and religion "a very excellent sort of thing, that ought to be countenanced and kept up." When he joined so loudly in the service, it seemed more by way of example to the lower orders, to show them, that though so great and wealthy, he was not above being religious; as I have seen a turtle-fed alderman publicly swallow a basin of charity soup, smacking his lips at every mouthful, and pronouncing it "excellent food for the poor." When the service was at an end, I was curious to witness the several exits of my groups. The young noblemen and their sisters, as the day was fine, preferred strolling home across the fields, chatting with the country people as they went. The others departed as they came, in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] grand parade. Again were the equipages wheeled up to the gate. There was again the smacking of whips, the clattering of hoofs, and the glittering of harness. The horses started off almost at a bound; the villagers again hurried to right and left; the wheels threw up a cloud of dust, and the aspiring family was wrapt out of sight in a whirlwind.

Marlowe's Tamburlaine . During my residence in the country, I used frequently to attend at the old village church. Its shadowy aisles, its mouldering monuments, its dark oaken pannelling, all reverend with the gloom of departed years, seemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation. A Sunday, too, in the country, is so holy in its repose: such a pensive quiet reigns over the face of nature, that every restless passion is charmed down, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] we feel all the natural religion of the soul gently springing up within us. Sweet day, so pure, so calm, so bright, The bridal of the earth and sky!-- I do not pretned to be what is called a devout man, but ther are feelings that visit me in a country church, amidst the beautiful serenity of nature, which I experience no where else; and if not a more religious, I am certainly a better, man on Sunday, than on any other day of the seven. But in this church I felt myself continually thrown back upon the world by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms around me. The only being that seemed thoroughly to feel the humble and prostrate piety of a true christian, was a poor decrepid old woman, bending under the weight of years and infirmities. She bore the traces of something better than abject poverty The lingerings of decent pride were visible in her appearance. Her dress, though humble in the extreme, was scrupulously clean. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] Some trivial respect, too, had been awarded her, for she did not take her seat among the village poor, but sat alone on the steps of the altar. She seemed to have survived all love, all friendship, all society, and to have nothing left her but the hopes of heaven. When I saw her feebly rising and bending her aged form in prayer--habitually conning her prayer book, which her palsied hand and failing eyes could not permit her to read, but which she evidently knew by heart--I felt that the faltering voice of that poor woman arose to heaven far before the responses of the clerk, the swell of the organ, or the chanting of the choir. I am fond of loitering about country churches, and this was so delightfully situated, that it frequently attracted me. It stood on a knoll, round which a small stream made a beautiful bend, and then wound its way through a long reach of soft meadow scenery. The church was surrouned by yew trees, which seemed almost coeval with itself. Its tall gothic spire shot up lightly from among them, with rooks [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] and crows generally wheeling about it. I was seated here there one still sunny morning, watching two labourers who were digging a grave. They had chosen one of the most remote and neglected corners of the church yard, where, by the number of nameless graes around, it would appear that the indigent and friendless were huddled into the earth. I was told that the newmade grave was for the only son of a poorwidow. While I was meditating on the distinctions of worldly rank, which extend thus down into the very dust, the toll of the bell announced the approach of the funeral. They were the obsequies of poverty, with which pride had nothing to do. A coffin of the plainest materials, without pall or other covering, was borne by some of the villagers. The sexton walked before with an air of cold indifference. There were no mock mourners in the trappings of affected wo, but there was one real mourner who feebly tottered after the corpse. It was the aged mother of the deceased--the poor old woman whom I had seen seated on the steps of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] altar. She was supported by a humble friend, who was endeavoring to comfort her. A few of the neighboring poor had joined the train, and some children of the village were running hand in hand, now shouting with unthinking mirth, and sometimes pausing to gaze, with ' childish curiosity, on the grief of the mourner. As the funeral train approached the grave, the parson issued out of the church porch, porch in the surplice, with prayer book in hand, and attended by the clerk. The service, however, was a mere act of charity. The deceased had been destitute, and the survivor was pennyless. It was shuffled through, therfore, in form, but coldly and unfeelingly. The well-fed priest scarcely moved ten steps from the church door; his voice could scarcely be heard at the grave; and never did I hear the funeral service, that sublime and touching ceremony, turned into such a frigid mummery of words. I approached the grave. The coffin was placed on the ground. On it were inscribed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] the name and age of the deceased--"George Somers, aged 26 years." The poor mother had been assisted to kneel down at the head of it. Her withered hands were clasped, as if in prayer, but I could perceive, by a feeble rocking of the body, and a convulsive motion of the lips that she was gazing on the last reliques of her son with the yearnings of a mother's heart. The service being ended, preparations were made to deposit the coffin in the earth. There was that bustling stir, that breaks so harshly on the feelings of grief and affection: directions given in the cold tones of business; the striking of spades into sand and gravel, which, at the grave of those we love, is, of all sounds, the most withering. The bustle around seemed to awaken the mother from a wretched reverie. She raised her glazed eyes, and looked about with a faint wildness. As the men approached with cords to lower the coffin into the grave, she wrung her hands and broke into an agony of grief. The poor woman who attended her took her by the arm, endeavored to raise her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] from the earth, and to whisper something like consolation--"Nay, now--nay, now--don't take it so sorely to heart." She could only shake her head, and wring her hands, as one not to be comforted. As they lowere the body into the earth, the creaking of the cords seemed to agonize her; but when, on some accidental obstruction, there was a jolting of the coffin, all the tenderness of the mother burst forth; as if any harm could come to him who was far beyoind the reach of worldly suffering. I could see no more--my heart swelled into my throat--my eyes filled with tears--I felt as if I were acting a barbarous part in standing by and gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish. I wandered to another part of the church yard, where I remained until the funeral train had dispersed. When I saw the mother slowly and painfully quitting the grave, leaving behind her the remains of all that was dear to her on earth, and returning to silence and destitution, my heart [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] ached for her. What, thought I, are the distresses of the rich! they hav friends to soothe-- pleasures to beguile--a world to divert and dissipate their griefs. What are the sorrows of the young! Their growing minds soon close above the wound--their elastic spirits soon rise beneath the pressure--their green and ductile affections soon twine around new objects. But the sorrows of a widow, aged, solitary, destitute, mourning over an only son, the last solace of her years; these are the sorrows which make us feel the impotency of consolation. It was some time before I left the church yard. On my way homeward, I met with the woman who had acted as comforter: she was just returning from accompanying the mother to her lonely habitation, and I drew from her some particulars connected with the affecting scene I had witnessed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] The pareents of the deceased had resided in the village from childhood. They had inhabited one of the neatest cottages, and by various rural occupations, and the assistance of a small garden, had supported themselves creditably and comfortably, and led a happy and a blameless life. They had one son, who had grown up to be the staff and pride of their age.-- "Oh sir!" said the good woman, "he was such a likely lad, so sweet-tempered, so kind to every one around him, so dutiful to his parents! It did one's heart good, to see him of a Sunday, drest out in his best, so tall, so straight, so cheery, supporting his old mother to church--for she was always fonder of leaning on George's arm, than on her good man's; and, poor soul, she might well be proud of him, for a finer lad there was not in the country round." Unfortunately, the son was tempted, during a year of scarcity and agricultural hardship, to enter in to the service of one of the small craft that plied on a neighboring river. He had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] not been long in this employ, when he was entrapped by a press-gang, and carried off to sea. His parents received the tidings of his seizure, but beyond that they could learn nothing. It was the loss of their main prop. The father, who was already infirm, grew heartless and melancholy, and sunk into his grave. The widow, left lonely in her age and feebleness, could no longer support herself, and came upon the parish. Still there was a kind feeling toward her throughout the village, and a certain respect as one of the oldest inhabitants. As no one applied for the cottage in which she had passed so many happy days, she was permitted to remain in it, where she lived solitary and almost helpless. The few wants of nature were chiefly supplied from the scanty productions of her little garden, which the neighbours would now and then cultivate for her. It was but a few days before the time at which these circumstances were told me, that she was gathering some vegetables for her repast, when she heard the cottage door that faced the garden [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] den suddenly opened. A stranger came out, and seemed to be looking eagerly and wildly around. He was dressed in seamen's clothes, was emaciated and ghastly pale, and bore the air of one broken by sickness and hardships. He saw her, and hastened toward her, but his steps were faint and faltering; he sank on his knees before her, and sobbed like a child. The poor woman gazed upon him with a vacant and wandering eye---"Oh my dear, dear mother! don't you know your son! your poor boy George!" It was, indeed, the wreck of her once noble lad; who, shattered by wounds, by sickness and foreign imprisonment, had, at length, dragged his wasted limbs homeward, to repose among the scenes of his childhood. I will not attempt to detail the particulars of such a meeting, where joy and sorrow were so completely blended: still he was alive! he was come home! he might yet live to comfort and cherish her old age! Nature, however, was exhausted in him; and if any thing had been wanting to finish the work of fate, the desolation of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] his native cottage would have been sufficient. He stretched himself on the pallet where his widowed mother had passed many a sleepless night, and he never rose from it again. The villagers, when they heard that George Somers had returned, crowded to see him, offering every comfort and assistance that their humble means afforded. He, however, was too weak to talk---he could only look his thanks. His mother was his constant attendant, and he seemed unwilling to be helped by any other hand. There is something in sickness that breaks down the pride of manhood; that softens the heart, and brings it back to the feelings of infancy. Who that has suffered, even in advanced life, in sickness and despondency; who that has pined on a weary bed in the neglect and loneliness of a foreign land, but has thought on the mother "that looked on his childhood," that smoothed his pillow, and administered to his helplessness. Oh! there is an enduring tenderness in the love of a mother to a son that transcends all other affections of the heart. It is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] neither to be chilled by selfishness, nor daunted by danger, nor weakened by worthlessness, nor stifled by ingratitude. She will sacrifice every comfort to his convenience; she will surrender every pleasure to his enjoyment; she will glory in his fame, and exult in his prosperity: and, if adversity overtakes him, he will be the dearer to her by misfortune; and if disgrace settle upon his name, she will still love and cherish him; and if all the world beside cast him off, she will be all the world to him. Poor George Somers had known well what it was to be in sickness, and none to soothe---lonely and in prison, and none to visit him. He could not endure his mother from his sight; if she moved away, his eye would follow her. She would sit for hours by his bed, watching him as he slept. Sometimes he would start from a feverish dream, look anxiously up until he saw her venerable form bending over him, when he would take her hand, lay it on his bosom, and fall asleep with the tranquillity of a child. In this way he died. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] My first impulse on hearing this humble tale of affliction, was to visit the cottage of the mourner, and administer pecuniary assistance, and, if possible, comfort. I found, however, on inquiry, that the good feelings of the villagers had prompted them to do every thing that the case admitted: and as the poor knew best how to console each other's sorrows, I did not venture to intrude. The next Sunday I was at the village church; when, to my surprise, I saw the poor old woman tottering down the aisle to her accustomed seat on the steps of the altar. She had made an effort to put on something like mourning for her son; and nothing could be more touching than this struggle between pious affection and utter poverty: a black riband or so, a faded black handkerchief, and one or two more such humble attempts to express by outward signs that grief which passes show. When I looked round upon the storied monuments; the stately hatchments; the cold marble pomp, with which grandeur mourned [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-230.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] magnificently over departed pride; and turned to this poor widow bowed down by age and sorrow at the altar of her god, and offering up the prayers and praises of a pious, though a broken heart, I felt that this living monument of real grief was worth them all. I related her story to some of the wealthy members of the congregation, and they were moved at it. They exerted themselves to render her situation more comfortable, and to lighten her afflictions. It was, however, but smoothing a few steps to the grave. In the course of a Sunday or two after, she was missed from her usual seat at church, and before I left the neighbourhood, I heard, with a feeling of satisfaction, that she had quietly breathed her last, and gone to rejoin those she loved, in that world where sorrow is never known, and friends are never parted.

The popularity of a saint, therefore, may be known by the number of these offerings. One, perhaps, is left to moulder in the darkness of his little chapel; another may have a solitary lamp to throw [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] its blinking rays athwart his effigy; while the whole blaze of adoration is lavished at the shrine of some beatified father of renown. The wealthy devotee brings his huge luminary of wax; the eager zealot his seven branched candlestick, and even the mendicant pilgrim is, by no means, satisfied that sufficient light is thrown upon the deceased, unless he hang up his little lamp of smoking oil. The consequence is, in the eagerness to enlighten, they are often apt to obscure; and I have occasionally seen an unlucky saint almost smoked out of countenance by the officiousness of his followers. In like manner has it fared with the immortal Shakspeare. Every writer considers it his bounden duty to light up some portion of his character or works, and rescue some merit from oblivion. The commentator, opulent in words, produces vast tomes of dissertations; the common herd of editors send up mists of obscurity from their notes at the bottom of each page, and every casual scribbler brings his farthing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] rushlight of eulogy or research, to swell the cloud of incense and of smoke. As I honour all established usages of my brethren of the quill, I thought it but proper to contribute my mite of homage to the memory of the illustrious bard. I was for some time, however, sorely puzzled in what way I should discharge this duty. I found myself anticipated in every attempt at a new reading; every doubtful line had been explained a dozen different ways, and perplexed beyond the reach of elucidation; and as to fine passages, they had all been amply praised by previous admirers; nay, so completely had the bard, of late, been overlarded with panegyric by a great German critic, that it was difficult now to find even a fault that had not been argued into a beauty. In this perplexity, I was one morning turning over his pages, when I happened upon the comic scenes of Henry IV. and was, in a moment, completely lost in the mad cap revelry of the Boar's Head Tavern. So vividly and naturally [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] are these scenes of humour depicted, and with such force and consistency are the characters sustained, that they become mingled up in the mind with the facts and personages of real life. To few readers does it occur, that these are all ideal creations of a poet's brain, and that, in sober truth, no such knot of merry roysters ever enlivened the dull neighbourhood of Eastcheap. For my part, I love to give myself up to the illusions of poetry. A hero of fiction who never existed, is just as valuable to me as a hero of history who existed a thousand years since: and, if I may be excused such an insensibility to the common ties of human nature, I would not give up fat Jack for half the great men of ancient chronicle. What have the heroes of yore done for me, or men like me? They have conquered countries of which I do not enjoy an acre; or they have gained laurels of which I do not inherit a leaf; or they have furnished examples of hair brained prowess, which I have neither the opportunity nor the inclination to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] follow. But, old Jack Falstaff!---kind Jack Falstaff!---sweet Jack Falstaff! has enlarged the boundaries of human enjoyment; he has added vast regions of wit and good humour, in which the poorest man may revel; and has bequeathed a never failing inheritance of jolly laughter, to make mankind merrier and better to the latest posterity. A thought suddenly struck me: "I will make a pilgrimage to Eastcheap," said I, closing the book, "and see if the old Boar's Head Tavern still exists. Who knows but I may light upon some legendary traces of Dame Quickly and her guests; at any rate, there will be a kindred pleasure in treading the halls once vocal with their mirth, to that the toper enjoys, in smelling to the empty cask, once filled with generous wine." The resolution was no sooner formed than put in execution. I forbear to treat of the various adventures and wonders I encountered in my travels; of the haunted regions of Cocklane; of the faded glories of Little Britain, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] the parts adjacent; what perils I ran in Cateaton Street and Old Jewry; of the renowned Guildhall and its two stunted giants, the pride and wonder of the city, and the terror of all unlucky urchins; and how I visited London Stone, and struck my staff upon it, in imitation of that arch rebel, Jack Cade. Let it suffice to say, however, that I at length arrived in merry Eastcheap, that ancient region of wit and wassail, where the very names of the streets relished of good cheer, as Pudding lane bears testimony even at the present day. For Eastcheap, says old Stow, "was always famous for its convivial doings. The cookes cried hot ribbes of beef rosted, pies well baked, and other victuals: there was clattering of pewter pots, harpe, pipe, and sawtrie." Alas! how sadly is the scene changed since the roaring days of Falstaff and old Stow. The mad cap royster has given place to the plodding tradesman; the clattering of pots and the sound of "harpe and sawtry," to the din of carts and the accursed dinging of the dustman's bell; and no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] song is heard, save, haply, the strain of some syren from Billingsgate, chaunting the eulogy of deceased mackerel. I sought, in vain, for the ancient abode of Dame Quickly. The only relique of it is a Boar's head, carved in relief in stone, which formerly served as the sign, but, at present, is built into the parting line of two houses which stand on the scite of the renowned old tavern. For the history of this little empire of good fellowship, I was referred to a tallow-chandler's widow, opposite, who had been born and brought up on the spot, and was looked up to as the indisputable chronicler of the neighbourhood. I found her seated in a little back parlour, the window of which looked out upon a yard about eight feet square, laid out as a flower-garden; while a glass door opposite, afforded a distant peep of the street, through a vista of soap and tallow candles; the two views, which comprised, in all probability, her prospects of life, and the little world in which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] she had lived, and moved, and had her being, for the better part of a century. To be versed in the history of Eastcheap, great and little, from London Stone even unto the Monument, was, doubtless, in her opinion, to be acquainted with the history of the universe. Yet, with all this, she possessed the simplicity of true wisdom, and that liberal, communicative disposition, which I have generally remarked in intelligent old ladies, knowing in the concerns of their neighbourhood. Her information, however, did not extend far back into antiquity. She could throw no light upon the history of the Boar's Head, from the time that Dame Quickly espoused the valiant Pistol, until the great fire of London, when it was unfortunately burnt down. It was soon rebuilt, and continued to flourish under the old name and sign, until a dying landlord, struck with remorse for double scores, bad measures, and other inquities which are incident to the sinful race of Publicans, endeavoured to make his peace with heaven, by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] bequeathing the tavern to St. Michael's Church, Crooked Lane, toward the supporting of a chaplain. For some time the vestry meetings were regularly held there; but it was observed that the old Boar never held up his head under church government. He gradually declined, and finally gave his last gasp about thirty years since. The tavern was then turned into shops; but a picture of it was still preserved in St. Michael's Church, which stood just in the rear. To get a sight of this picture was now my determination; so, having informed myself of the abode of the sexton, I took my leave of the venerable chronicler of Eastcheap, my visit having doubtless raised greatly her opinion of her legendary lore, and furnished an important incident in the history of her life. It cost me some difficulty, and much curious inquiry, to ferret out the humble hanger-on to the church. I had to explore Crooked Lane, and divers little alleys, and elbows, and dark passages, with which this old city is perforated, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] like an ancient cheese, or a worm-eaten chest of drawers. At length I traced him to a corner of a small court, surrounded by lofty houses, where the inhabitants enjoy about as much of the face of heaven, as a community of frogs at the bottom of a well. The sexton was a meek, acquiescing little man, of a bowing, lowly habit; yet he had a pleasant twinkle in his eye, and if encouraged, would now and then venture a small pleasantry, such as a man of his low estate might venture to make in the company of high church wardens, and other mighty men of the earth. I found him in company with the deputy organist, seated apart, like Milton's angels, discoursing, no doubt, on high doctrinal points, and settling the affairs of the church over a friendly pot of ale---for the lower classes of English seldom deliberate on any weighty matter without the assistance of a cool tankard to clear their understandings. I arrived at the moment when they had finished their ale and their argument, and were about to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] repair to the church to put it in order; so, having made known my wishes, I received their gracious permission to accompany them. The Church of St. Michael's, Crooked Lane, standing at a short distance from Billingsgate, is enriched with the tombs of many fishmongers of renown; and as every profession has its galaxy of glory, and its constellation of great men, I presume the monument of a mighty fishmonger of the olden time is regarded with as much reverence by succeeding generations of the craft, as poets feel on contemplating the tomb of Virgil, or soldiers the monument of a Marlborough or a Turenne. I cannot but turn aside, while thus speaking of illustrious men, to observe, that St. Michael's, Crooked Lane, contains also the ashes of that doughty champion, William Walworth, Knight, who so manfully clove down the sturdy wight, Wat Tyler, in Smithfield, a hero worthy of honourable blazon, as almost the only Lord Mayor on record famous for deeds of arms: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] the sovereigns of Cockney being generally renowned as the most pacific of all potentates. [7] Adjoining the church, in a small cemetery, immediately under the back windows of what was once the Boar's Head, stands the tomb stone of Robert Preston, whilome drawer at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] the tavern. It is now nearly a century since this trusty drawer of good liquor closed his bustling career, and was thus quietly deposited within call of his customers. As I was clearing away the weeds from his epitaph, the little sexton drew me on one side with a mysterious air, and informed me in a low voice, that once upon a time, on a dark wintry night, when the wind was unruly, howling and whistling, banging about doors and windows, and twirling weathercocks, so that the living were frightened out of their beds, and even the dead could not sleep quietly in their graves, the ghost of honest Preston, which happened to be airing itself in the churchyard, was attracted by the well-known call of "waiter" from the Boar's Head, and made its sudden appearance in the midst of a roaring club, just as the parish clerk was singing a stave from the "mirrie garland of Captain Death," to the discomfiture of sundry train-band captains, and the conversion of an infidel attorney, who became a zealous christian on the spot, and was never known to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] twist the truth afterwards, except in the way of business. I beg it may be remembered, that I do not pledge myself for the authenticity of this anecdote, though it is well known that the churchyards and by-corners of this old metropolis are very much infested with perturbed spirits, and every one must have heard of the Cock Lane ghost, and the apparition that guards the regalia in the Tower, which has frightened so many bold sentinels almost out of their wits. Be all this as it may, this Robert Preston seems to have been a worthy successor to the nimbletongued Francis, who attended upon the revels of Prince Hal, to have been equally prompt with his "anon, anon, sir," and to have transcended his predecessor in honesty, for Falstaff, the veracity of whose taste no man will venture to impeach, flatly accuses Francis of putting lime in his sack; whereas honest Preston's epitaph lauds him for the sobriety of his conduct, the soundness of his wine, and the fairness [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] of his measure. [8] The worthy dignitaries of the church, however, did not appear much captivated by the sober virtues of the tapster; the deputy organist, who had a moist look out of the eye, made some shrewd remark on the abstemiousness of a man brought up among full hogsheads, and the little sexton corroborated his opinion by a significant wink, and a dubious shake of the head. Thus far my researches, though they threw much light on the history of tapsters, fishmongers, and Lord Mayors, yet disappointed me in the great object of my quest, the picture of the Boar's Head Tavern. No such painting Bacchus, to give the toping world surprise, Produced one sober son, and here he lies. Though rear'd among full hogsheads, he defy'd The charms of wine, and every one beside. O reader, if to justice thou'rt inclin'd, Keep honest Preston daily in thy mind. He drew good wine, took care to fill his pots, Had sundry virtues that excus'd his faults. You that on Bacchus have the like dependance, Pray copy Bob, in measure and attendance. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] was to be found in the church of St. Michael's. "Marry and amen!" said I, "here endeth my research!" So I was giving the matter up, with the air of a baffled antiquary, when my friend the sexton, perceiving me to be curious in every thing relative to the old tavern, offered to show me the choice vessels of the vestry, which had been handed down from remote times, when the parish meetings were held at the Boar's Head. These were deposited in the parish club room, which had been transferred, on the decline of the ancient establishment, to a tavern in the neighbourhood. A few steps brought us to the house, which stands No. 12 Mile Lane, bearing the title of The Masons' Arms, and is kept by Master Edward Honeyball, the "bully-rock" of the establishment. It is one of those little taverns which abound in the heart of the city, and form the centre of gossip and intelligence of the neighbourhood. We entered the bar-room, which was narrow and darkling; for in these close lanes but few rays of reflected light are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] enabled to struggle down to the inhabitants, whose broad day is at best but a tolerable twilight. The room was partitioned into boxes, each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth, ready for dinner. This showed that the guests were of the good old stamp, and divided their day equally, for it was but just one o'clock. At the lower end of the room was a clear coal fire, before which a breast of lamb was roasting. A row of bright brass candlesticks and pewter mugs glistened along the mantle piece, and an old fashioned clock ticked in one corner. There was something primitive in this medley of kitchen, parlour, and hall, that carried me back to earlier times, and pleased me. The place, indeed, was humble, but every thing had that look of order and neatness, that bespeaks the superintendence of a notable English housewife. A group of amphibious looking beings, who might be either fishermen or sailors, were regaling themselves in one of the boxes. As I was a visiter of rather higher pretensions, I was ushered into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] a little mis-shapen back room, having at least nine corners. It was lighted by a sky-light, furnished with antiquated leathern chairs, and ornamented with the portrait of a fat pig. It was evidently appropriated to particular customers, and I found a shabby gentleman, in a red nose, and oil-cloth hat, seated in one corner, meditating on a half-empty pot of porter. The old sexton had taken the landlady aside, and with an air of profound importance imparted to her my errand. Dame Honeyball was a likely, plump, bustling, little woman, and no bad substitute for that paragon of hostesses, Dame Quickly. She seemed delighted with an opportunity to oblige, hurried up stairs to the archives of her house, where the precious vessels of the parish club were deposited, and returned, smiling and courtesying, with them in her hands. The first she presented me was a japanned iron tobacco box, of gigantic size, out of which, I was told, the vestry had smoked at their stated meetings, since time immemorial; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] and which was never suffered to be profaned by vulgar hands, or used on common occasions. I received it with becoming reverence; but what was my delight, at beholding on its cover the identical painting of which I was in quest. There was displayed the outside of the Boar's Head Tavern, and before the door the whole convivial group, at table, in full revel, pictured with that wonderful fidelity and force, with which the portraits of renowned generals and commodores are illustrated on tobacco boxes, for the benefit of posterity. Lest, however, there should be any mistake, the cunning limner had warily inscribed the names of Prince Hal and Falstaff on the bottoms of their chairs. On the inside of the cover was an inscription, nearly obliterated, recording that this box was the gift of Sir Richard Gore, for the use of the vestry meetings at the Boar's Head Tavern, and that it was "repaired and beautified by his successor, Mr. John Packard, 1767." Such is a faithful description of this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] august and venerable relique, and I question whether the learned Scriblerius contemplated his Roman shield, or the Knights of the round table the long-sought san-greal, with more exultation. While I was meditating on it with enraptured gaze, Dame Honeyball, who was highly gratified by the interest it excited, put in my hands a drinking cup or goblet, which also belonged to the vestry, and was descended from the old Boar's Head. It bore the inscription of having been the gift of Francis Wythers, Knight, and was held, she told me, in exceeding great value, being considered very "antyke." This last opinion was strengthened by the shabby gentleman in the red nose and oil-cloth hat, and whom I strongly suspect to be a lineal descendant from the valiant Bardolph. He suddenly aroused from his meditation on the pot of porter, and casting a knowing look at the goblet, exclaimed, "aye, aye, the head don't ache now, that made that there article." The great importance attached to this me [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] mento of ancient revelry by modern church wardens, at first puzzled me; but there is nothing sharpens the apprehension so much as antiquarian research; for I immediately perceived that this could be no other than the identical "parcel-gilt goblet" on which Falstaff made his loving, but faithless, vow to Dame Quickly; and which would, of course, be treasured up with care among the regalia of her domains, as a testimony of that solemn contract. [9] Mine hostess, indeed, gave me a long history how the goblet had been handed down from generation to generation. She also entertained me with many particulars concerning the worthy vestrymen who have seated themselves thus quietly on the stools of the ancient roysters of Eastcheap, and, like so many commentators, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] utter clouds of smoke in honour of Shakspeare. These I forbear to relate, lest my readers should not be as curious in these matters as myself. Suffice it to say, the neighbours, one and all, about Eastcheap, believe that Falstaff and his merry crew actually lived and revelled there. Nay, there are several legendary anecdotes concerning him still extant among the oldest frequenters of the Masons' Arms, which they give, as transmitted down from their forefathers; and Mr. M`Kash, an Irish hair dresser, whose shop stands ont he site of the old Boar's Head, has several dry jokes of Fat Jack's, not laid down in the books, with which he makes his customers ready to die of laughter. I now turned to my friend the sexton to make some farther inquiries, but I found him sunk in pensive meditation. His head had declined a little on one side; a deep sigh heaved from the very bottom of his stomach, and, though I could not see a tear trembling in his eye, yet a moisture was evidently stealing from a corner of his mouth. I followed the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf214v3&image=214-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] direction of his eye through the door which stood open, and found it fixed wistfully on the savoury breast of lamb, roasting in dripping richness before the fire. I now called to mind, that in the eagerness of my recondite investigation, I was keeping the poor man from his dinner. My bowels yearned with sympathy, and putting in his hand a small token of my gratitude and good will, I departed with a hearty benediction on him, Dame Honeyball, and the parish club of Crooked Lane;---not forgetting my shabby, but sententious friend, in the oil-cloth hat and copper nose. Thus have I given a "tedious brief" account of this interesting research, for which, if it prove too short and unsatisfactory, I can only plead my inexperience in this branch of literature, so deservedly popular at the present day. I am aware that a more skilful illustrator of the immortal bard would have swelled the materials I have touched upon, to a good merchantable bulk, comprising the biographies of [
