A certayn Curat in the contrey there was that preched in the pulpit of the ten commandementys Seyng that there were ten comaudemetes that euery man ought to kepe / & he that brake any of the / comytted greuous syn / how be it he sayd that somtyme it was dedly syn & somtyme venyall / But when it was dedly syn & when venyall / there were many douts therin And a mylner a yong ma a mad felow that cam seldom to church / & had ben at very fewe sermos or none in all his lyfe answerd hym tha shortly this wyse. I meruel master parson that ye say ther be so many comaudemetis & so many doutys For I neuer hard tell but of ii. comandemets that is to say comande me to you & comaude me fro you. Nor I neuer herd tell of mo doutis but twayn that ys to say dout the candell. & dout the fyre. At which answere all the people fell a laughynge. ¶By this tale a man may well perceyue that they that be brought vp with out leryng or good maner shall neuer be but rude and bestely all though they haue good naturall wyttys. On a tyme there was a Ioly Citesyn walkyng in the cotrey for sport which met with a folysh prest & in dirysyo in comunycacio cald hym syr Iohn. this prest vnderstonding his mockyng calde him master rafe / why quod the cytesyn doste thou call me master rafe / mary quod the prest why callyst me syr Iohn. Then quod the cytesen I call the syr Iohn becawse euery folysh preste most comonly is calde sir Iohn / Mary qd the prest & I call the master rafe because euery proud Cocold most comenly is callyd master Rafe. At the which answer all that were by laught a pace because dyuers there supposyd the same cytesen to be a cokcold in dede. ¶By thys tale ye may se that he that delyteh to deryde & laughe other to skorne is somtyme hym selfe more derydyd. A wyfe ther was which had apointed her pretys to com to her bed in the night which seruat had long woyd her to haue his plesure which acordige to the apoitmet ca to her bed syde i the night her husbad liyng by her & when she perceyuyd hym ther she caught hi by the had & hyld hym fast & incotinet wakened her husbod & sayd / Sir it is so ye haue a fals & an vntru seruat to you which is william your prentys & hath loge woyd me to haue his plesur / & becawse I coud nat auoyde his importunate request I haue appoityd hym this night to met me in the garde i the herber & yf ye wyll aray your self in myn aray & go theder ye shall se the profe therof & then ye may rebuke hym as ye thike best by your dyscrecyon / this husbad thus aduertised by his wyfe / put vpo hym his wyues raymte & went to the herber and when he was gone thyder the prentys ca in to bed to his mastres wher for a seaso they wer both contet & pleasyd ech other by the space of an hour or .ii. but when she thought tyme couenyet she sayd to the prentyse Now go thy way in to the herber & mete hym & take a good waster in thy had & say thou dydys it but to proue whether I woldbe a good woma or no & reward hym as thou thynkyst best. This prentys doig after his mastres cocell wet to the herber wher he founde his master i his mastres apparel & sayd A thou harlot art thou come hether / now I se well yf I wold be fals to my master thou woldest be a strog hore but I had leuer thou wer hagyd tha I wold do him so traterous a dede therfore I shall gyue the some punishment as thou lyke an hore hast deseruyd / & therwith lapt hi wel about the sholders & bak & gaue hym a dose or .ii. good strypys the master felyng hym selfe sowhat to smart sayd pese wyllia myne own true good seruat for godys sake hold thy hadys for I a thi master & not thi mastres na hore qd he thou lyest thou art but an harlot & I dyd but to proue the / & smote hi agayn Alas man quod the master I beseche the nomore for I am not she for I am thy master fele for I haue a berd and therwith he sparyd his had & felt hys berd Alas master qd the prentys I crye you mercy & then the mayster went vnto hys wyfe & she askyd hym how he had sped & he aswerd Iwis wyfe I haue bene shrewdly betyn how be it I haue cause to be glad for I thanke god I haue as trew a wyfe & as trew a seruant as any man hath in englond. ¶By this tale ye may se that it is not wysdome for a man to be rulyd alway after hys wyues councell. It fortunyd that in a market towne in the counte of Suffolk there was a stage play i the which playe on callyd Iohn adroyns wich dwelyd i a nother vyllage ii. myle fro thes playd the deuyll. And whe the play was done this Iohn adroyns i the euenyng departyd fro the sayd market towne to go home to his owne house & be cause he had there no chage of clothige he went forth i his deuylls a parell whiche i the way comyng homward ca thorow a waren of conys belogyng to a getylma of the vyllage wher he hym selfe dwelt. at which tyme it fortunyd a prest a vycar of a church therby with ii or iii. other vnthryfty felowes had brought with the a hors a hey & a feret to thetet ther to get conis & whe the feret was in the yerth & the hey set ouer the path way wheri thys Iohn adroyns shold com. this prest & this other felowes saw hym com i the deuyls raymet cosyderig that they were i the deuyls seruyse & stelig of cones & supposynge it had ben the deuyll in dede for fere ran away. this Iohn adroyns i the deuyls raymet & be cause it was sowhat dark saw not the hey but wet forth i hast & stoblid therat & fell down & wyth the fall he had almost broke But whe he was a lytyll reuyuyd he lokyd vp & spyed it was a hay to chach connys & lokyd further / & saw that they ran away for fere of hym / & saw a horse tyed to a bush laden with connys whych they had taken / & he toke the horse & the haye & lepe vpo the horse & rode to the gentylmannys place that was lorde of the waren / to the entente to haue thanke for takynge suche a pray. And when he cam / knokyd at the gatys. To whome anone one of the gentylmannys seruauntys askyd who was there / and sodeynly openyd the gate / and assone as he perceyuyd hym in the deuyls raymente was sodenly abashyd / and sparryd the dore agayn / & went in to his mayster / and sayd & sware to hys mayster that the deuyil was at the gate / and wolde come in. The gentylman heryng hym say so callyd a nother of hys seruauntys & bad hym go to the gate to knowe who was there. This seconde seruaut cam to the gate durst not open it / but askyd with lowd voyce who was there. thys Iohn Androyns in the deuyls apperell answerd with a hye voyce and sayd Tell thy master I must nedys speke with hym or I go. This secod seruaut heryng that answer supposynge also it had bene the deuyll / went in agayn to his master and sayd thus / mayster yt is the deuyll in dede that ys at the gate / and sayth he must nedys speke with you or he go hens. The gentylma than began a lyttyll to bashe and callyd the steward of hys howse / whyche was the wysyst seruaunt that he had and bad hym to go the gate and to brynge hym sure worde who was there. This steward be cause he thought he wold se surely who was there came to the gate and lokyd thorow the chinys of the gate in dyuers placys / and saw well that yt was the deuyll and sat vpon an horse and hangynge aboute the saddell on euery syde sawe the cony heddys hengynge down / than he came to his mayster aferde in greate haste and sayd / By goddys body yt is the deuyll in dede that is at the gate syttyng vpon an horse laden all wyth sowllys / and by lykelyhede / he is com for your soule purposely / and lakkyth but your soule / & yf he had your sowle I wene he shold be gone. This gentylman tha meruelouly abashyd callyd vp his chapleyn / and made the holy candell to be lyght / and gat holy water and wente to the gate wyth as many of hys seruauntys as durste go with hym / where the chaplayn with holy wordys of coniuracyon sayde / In the name of the fader / sonne and holy goost / I coniure the and charg the in the holy name of god to tell me why and wherfore thowe commyste hyther. This Iohu Androynys in the deuyllys apparell heryng theym begynne to coiure after suche maner sayd / Nay nay be not a ferd of me for I am a good dyuell I am Iohn Adroyns your neghboour dwellyng in thys towne and he that played the dyuell / to day in the play / I haue brought my mayster a dosen or / ii. of hys owne connyes that were stolyn in hys waren and theyr horse & theyr hay / and made theym for fere to ronne away / and when they herde hym thus speke by hys voyce they knew hym well ynoughe and openyd the gate and let hym come in / And so all the forsayd fere and dred was tornyd to myrth and dysporte. ¶By this tale ye may se that me fear many tymes more than they nede which hath causyd me to beleue that spyryttys & deuyls haue bene sene in dyuers placys when it hath bene nothynge so. Ther was a riche man which lay sore seke in his bed lyke to dy wherfore his eldyst son cam to hym & besechyd hym to gyue hym his blyssyng to whom the fader sayd son thou shalt haue goddys blessyng & myne / & for that that thou hast ben euer good of codycyons I gyue & bequeth the all my land / to whom he answered & sayd nay fader I trust you shal lyue & occupy them your selfe full well by goddys grace. Sone after came his ii. sone to hym lyke wyse & desyred his blessyng / to whom the fader sayd because thou hast be euer kynde & gentyll & I geue the goddys blessynge & myn and also I bequeth the all my mouable goodys / to whom he answerd and sayd / nay fader I trust ye shall lyue & do well & spend and vse your goodys your selfe by goddys grace. Anon after the iij. sone cam to hym & desyred his blessyng to whom the fader answerd & sayd by cause thou hast bene euyll & stoborne of condycyons & wolde neuer be ruled after my cousell I haue nother land nor goodys onbequethyd but onely a lytell vacant ground wher a galows standyth which now I geue and bequeth to the / and goddys curse withall to whom the sonne answerd as hys bretherne dyd & sayd nay fader I trust ye shall lyue & be in good helth and haue yt and occupy it your selfe by goddys grace. But after that the fader dyed & this thyrd son cotynuyd styll hys vnthryfty condycyons wherefore yt was hys fortune afterwarde for hys deseruyng to be hangyd on the same galows By this tale men may wel perceyue that yong people that wyll not be rulyd by theyr frendys councell in youth in tymys come to a shamfull ende. Two getylmen of accoyntauce wer appoyntyd to ly with a geyll woma in one nyght the one not knowige of the other at dyuers tymis This fyrst ad his houre appoyntyd ca / & in the bed ther he fortunid to lese a ryng / the .ii. gentylma when he was gone cam / & fortunyd to fynd the same rynge / & when he had sped hys besynes departyd / & .ii. or .iii. dayes after the furst getylman seyng his ryng on the others fynger chalengyd yt of hym he & denyed yt hym & bad hi tell wher he had lost it & he seyd i such a gentylwomans bed / than quod the other & ther founde I yt. & the one sayd he wolde haue yt / the other sayd he shulde not / tha they agreyd to be iuggid by the next ma that they mote / & it fortunid theym to mete with the husbad of the sayd gentyll woma & desyryd hym of his best Iugemet shewyng hym all hole mater / then quod he by my iugemet he that owd the shetys shuld haue the ryng / the quod they & for your good iugemet you shall haue the ryng. In a vyllage in sussex there dwellyd a husbandma whose wyfe fortunyd to fall syk. Thys husbandman came to the preest of the church and desyryd hys councell what thyng was best to help his wyfe / whyrh answeryd hym & sayd yt in bredstrete in londo there was a connyng Phesycyon whose name is callyd master Iordayne / Go to hym & shew hym that thy wyfe is syk and Impotent & not able to go & shew hym her water and beseech hym to be good master to the / and praye hym to do hys cure vppon her: and I warrant he wyll tech the some medsyne that shall help her. Thys husbandman folowyng hys councell ca to london & askyd of dyuers men which was the way to good ale strere so yt euery man yt hard hym laught hym to scorne. At the last one yt harde hym askyd him whether it were not bred strete that he wold haue / By god qd the husbandma ye say treuth: for I wyst well it was other brede or drink: So whe they had taught hym the way to bred strete & was eteryd into ye strete he askyd of dyuers men where one master Pyspot dwellyd whych sayd they knew no such ma & laught at hym apace. At last one askyd him whether it were not master Iordayn ye physycio. ye ye same qd ye husband ma for I wot well a iordayn & a pyspot is all one. So whe they had shewyd hym hys house he wet thyder & ca to hym & dyd hys erad thus & sayd Syr if it please your mashyp I vnderstand ye ar callyd a conyng confusyon: So it is my wyfe is syk & omnypotent & may not go & here I haue brought you her water I besech you do your corage vppon her & I shall gyue your mashyp a good reward. The phesycio perseyuyng by the water yt she was weke of nature bad hym get her mete yt were restoratyue & specyally if he coud let her haue a poudgarnet & to let her not ouercome her stomak wt mych mete tyll she haue an apetyte. Thys husbadma herd him speke of a poundgarnet & an apetite had wend he had spoken of a pound of garlyk and of an ape & shortly bought a pound of garlyk & after went to the stylyard & bought an ape of one of the marchantes & brought both home to hys wyfe & tyed the ape wt a cheyn at hys beddes fete / & made hys wyfe to ete the pound of garlyk whether she wolde or no / whereby she fell in so gret a lask that it purgyd all the corrupcio out of her body: wherby & by reso yt the ape that was tyde ther made so many mokkys skyppys & knakkes that made her oftymys to be mery & laugh that thankyd be god she was shortly restoryd to helth. ¶By thys tale ye may se that oft tymys medesyns taken at aduenturys do as mich good to the Pacyent as medesyns geuen by the solempne coucell of conyng physycyons. In the vnyuersyte of Oxonford there was a skoler yt delytyd mich to speke eloquent english & curious termis / And ca to ye cobler wyth hys shoys whych were pikid before as they vsyd ye reson to haue them cloutyd & sayd thys wyse / Cobler I pray the set me .ii tryangyls & .ii. semy cercles vppon my subpedytals & I shall gyue the for thy labor / Thys cobler because he vnderstode hym not half well aswerid shortly & sayd / Syr youre eloquence passith myne itelligence / but I promyse you yf ye meddyll wyth me / the clowtyng of youre shone shall coste you .iii. pence. ¶By thys tale me may lerne yt it is foly to study to speke eloquetly before them that be rude & vnlernyd. A certayn artificer in londo there was which was sore syk that coud not well dygest hys mete / to who a physyco cam to gyue hym councell & seyd yt he must vse to ete metis yt be light of dygestyon as small byrdys / as sparous or swallous & especyall ye byrd yt ys callyd a wagtayle whose fleshe ys meruelouse lyght of dygestyo because that byrd ys euer mouyng & styryng. The sik man heryng the phesition seyd so answeryd hym & seyd / Syr yf that be the cause yt those birdys be lyght of dygestyon Than I know a mete mych lyghter of dygestion tha other sparow swallow or wagtayle / & that ys my wyuys tog for it is neuer in rest but euer mouyng & styrryng. ¶By thys tale ye may lerne a good generall rule of phesyk. A woma ther was whych had had .iiii. husbades. It fortunyd also that this fourth husband died & was brouht to chirch vppon ye bere / who this woma folowyd & made gret mone & wext very sory. In so mych that her neybours thought she wold sowne & dy for sorow / wherfor one of her gossyps cam to her & spake to her in her ere & bad her for goddes sake to comfort her self & refrayne that lamentacon or ellys it wold hurt her gretly & perauenture put her in ieoperdy of her lyfe. To who this woma asweryd & sayd / Iwys good gosyp I haue gret cause to morne if ye knew all / for I haue byryed .iii. husbandys besyde thys man / but I was neuer i the case yt I am now / for there was not one of the but whe that I folowid the corse to chyrch yet I was sure alway of an other husbad before that ye corse cam out of my house / & now I am sure of no nother husband & therfore ye may be sure I haue gret cause to be sad & heuy. ¶By thys tale ye may se that the olde prouerbe ys trew that yt is as gret pyte to se a woman wepe as a gose to go barefote. A nother woman there was that knelyd at ye mas of requie whyle the corse of her husbande lay on the bere in the chyrch. To whom a yonge man came to speke wyth her in her ere as thoughe hyt had bene for som matre concernyng the funerallys / howe be yt he spake of no such matter but only wowyd her that he myghte be her husbande / to whome she answeryde & sayde thus / Syr by my trouthe I am sory that ye come so late / for I am sped all redy / For I was made sure yester day to a nother man. ¶By thys tale ye maye perceyue that women ofte tymes be wyse and lothe to lose any tyme. A merchant that thought to deride a myllner seyd vnto ye mylner syttyng among company. Sir I haue hard say that euery trew mylner that tollythe trewlye hath a gyldeyn thombe / the mylner answered & seyd it was trewth / Then quod the merchaunt I pray the let me se thy thomb / & when the mylner shewyd hys thomb the merchaunt sayd I can not perceyue yt thy thombe is gylt / but yt ys but as all other mennys thobis be / to whom the mylner answeryd & seyd / Syr trewthe yt ys that my thob is gylt how be it ye haue no power to se it / for ther is a properte euer incidet therto yt he yt ys a cokecold shall neuer haue power to se yt. One callyd Oconer an yrish lorde toke an horseman prysoner that was one of hys gret enmys / whiche for any request or yntrety yt ye horsman made gaue iugement that he shulde incotynet be hagyd / & made a frere to shryue hym and bad hym make hym redy to dye Thys frere yt shroue hym examyned hym of dyuers synes & askyd hym amog othere whyche were the grettyste synnys that euer he dyde / thys horsemane answeryd & sayde one of the grettyst actys that euer I dyde whyche I now most repent is that when I toke Oconer the laste weke in a churche and ther I myght haue brennyd hym church and all & because I had conscyence & pyte of brennyng of the church I taryed ye tyme so long yt oconer escaped / & that same deferring of brennyng of the chruch & so long taryeng of that tyme is one of the worst actys yt euer I dyd wherof I moste repente / Thys frere perceyuyng hym in that mynd sayd pece man in the name of god & change ye mynde & dye in charite or els thou shalt neuer come in heuen / nay quod the hors man I wyll neuer change yt mynde what so euer shall come to my soule / thys frere perceyuyng hym thus styll to contynew hys mide ca to oconer & seyd syr in ye name of god haue some pyte vppo thys mannys sowle & let hym not dye now tyll he be in a better mynde / For yf he dye now he hys so far out of charyte yt vtterly hys soule shalle be dampnyd / and shewyd hym what mynde he was in & all the hole matter as ys before shewyd. Thys horsman heryng ye frere thus intrete for hym sayd to oconer thus / Oconer thou seeyst well by thys mannys reporte yt yf I dye now I am out of charyte & not redy to go to heuen / & so it ys yt I am now out of charyte in dede / but thou seest well yt this frere ys a good man he is now well dysposyd & in charyte / and he is redy to go to heuen & so am not I / therfore I pray the hang vp thys frere whyle that he hys redy to go to heuyn and lette me tary tyl a nother tyme yt I may be i charyte and redy & mete to go to heuyn. This Oconer heryng this mad answere of hym sparyd the man & forgaue hym hys lyfe at that season. ¶By thys ye may se that he that is in daunger of his enmye yt hath no pyte / he can do no better than shew to hym the vttermoste of hys malycyous mynde whych that he beryth toward hym. The archdekyn of Essex yt had bene long in auctoryte in a tyme of vysytacion when all the preestys apperyd before hym callyd asyde .iii. of ye yog prestys whych were accusyd yt they coud not well say theyr deuyne seruyce / & askyd of the whe they sayd mas whether they sayd corpus meus or corpu meu. The furst preest sayd yt he sayd corpus meus. The secod sayd yt he sayd corpu meu. And the he askyd of the thyrd how he sayd / whych answeryd & sayd thus / syr because it is so gret a dout & dyuers men be in dyuers opynyons / therfore because I wold be sure I wold not offend whe I come to yt place I leue it clene out & say nothyng therfore / wherfore he then openly rebukyd them all thre. But dyuers that were present thought more defaut in hym because he hym selfe before tyme had admyttyd them to be preestys. ¶By thys tale ye may se that one ought to take hede how he rebukyth an other lest it torne most to hys owne rebuke. Two frerys sat at a gentylmans tabyll whych had before hym o a fastyng day an ele & cut the hed of the ele & layd it vppo one of ye Freres trechars / but the Frere because he wold haue had of ye myddyll part of the ele sayd to the gentylman he louyd no ele heddes / this gentylman also cut the tayle of ye ele & leyd it on the other Freres trechar / he lykewyse because he wold haue had of the myddyll parte of ye ele sayd he louyd no ele taylys. Thys gentylma perceyuyng that: gaue the tayle to the Frere yt sayd he louyd not the hed / & gaue the hed to hym that sayd he louyd not ye tayle.

A Ryche fraynklyng dwellyng in the countrey had a freer vsyng to his howse of whom he coud neuer be ryd & had taryed with him the space of a senyght & neuer depart wherfore the fraynklyng beyng wery of hym / on a tyme / as he & his wyfe & this frere sat to geder at supper faynyd hym selfe very angry with hys wyfe In somoche he sayd he wolde bete her This frere perseyuyng wel what they met sayd thus. master franklig I haue bene here this seuenyght when ye were fredys & I wyll tary here this fortenyght lenger but I wyll se you frendys agayne or I go thys man perseyuyng that he coude no good nor wolde not depart by none honest meanys answeryd hi shortly & sayd by god freere but thou shalte abyde here no lenger & toke hym by the shulders & thrust hym out of the dorys by vyolence. ¶By this ye may se that he that wyll lerne no good by example / nor good maner to hym shewyd is worthy to be taught with open rebukes. A frer Lymytour come into a pore mannys howse in the countrey and because this pore man thought this frere myght do hym some good he therfore thought to make hym good chere / But bycawse hys wyfe wolde dresse hym no good mete for roste / he therfor at dyner tyme sayde thus / By god wyfe bycawse thou dyddest dresse me no good mete to my dyner / were it nat for master frere / thou sholdest haue half a dosyn strypes Nay sir quod the frere I pray you spare nat for me / wherwith the wyf was angry & therfore at soupper she caused them to fare wors. ¶By thys ye may se it is good polycy for gestys yf they wyll haue any good chere to pleas alway the wyfe of the howse. There was a frere whiche though he were well lernyd yet he was callyd wycked of condycyons whiche had a Gentylmannys sonne to wayte vpon hym and to teche hym to speke latyn. ¶Thys frere came to thys chyldes fader dwellyng in the contrey / and becawse this frere wold haue this Gentylman to knowe that this chylde had metly well spent his tyme for the whyle he had bene with hym / he bad this chyld to make in latyn shortly Freres walke in the cloyster. This chylde halfe astonyed bycawse his master had hym make this latyn so shortly answered at all aduentures and sayd In circuitu impu ambulant. In the terme tyme a good old gentylman beyng a lawyer cam to london to the terme & as he came he hapened to ouertake a frere which was som vnthryft & wet alone without his beuer wherfor this getylman asked this frere where was his beuer that shold kepe hym copany and sayd it waa contrary to his relygyon to go alone / and it wolde cawse people to suppose hym to be some apostata or some vnthryft. By god syr quod the frere my felow comendeth hym vnto your mastershyp / who qd the gentylman I knowe hym nat / than quod the frere to the gentylman ye are the more to blame to aske for hym. ¶By this tale ye may se that he that geueth cousel to an vnthryft and techeth hym his dutye shall haue oftentymes but a mocke for his labour. Thre gentylme cam into an Inne where a fayre woman was tapster wherfor as these thre sat ther makyng mery echone of the kyssed her & made good pastyme & plesure howbeit one spake meryly & sayd I can not se how this gentylwoman is able to make pastyme & pleasure to vs all thre excepte that she were departed in thre partes. By my trouthe quod one of theym / yf that she myght be so departed than I wolde chose for my parte her hed and her fayre face that I myght alway kysse her Then quod the secod I wold haue the brest and hart for ther lyeth her loue Then quod the thyrd then ther is nothyng lefet for me but the loynys buttokkys & leggys & I am content to haue yt for my part. And when these getylmen had passyd the tyme ther by the space of one hour or ij they toke ther leue & were goynge away but or thye went the thyrd man that had chosen the bely & the buttokkys dyd kys the tapyster & bad her farewel what quod the fyrst ma that had chosen the face & the mouth why dost thou so thou dost me wronge to kys my parte that I haue chosen of her. O quod the other I pray the be not angry for I wolbe cotent that thou shalt kys my part for it. In essex there dwellyd a mery gentylman which had a cooke callyd Thomas that was gretly dyseasyd with the toth ake & complanyd to his mayster thereof whiche sayd he had a boke of medycis & sayd he wold loke vp his boke to se whether he cowd fynde any medecyn therfor it & so sende one of hys doughters to his study for his boke and incontynent lokyd vppon yt alonge season & than sayde thus to hys coke. Thomas quod he here is a medesyne for thy tothake & yt ys a charme but it wyll do you no good except ye knele on your knee and aske yt for seynt charyte. Thys man glad to be relesyd of hys payne knelyd & sayd mayster for seit charyte let me haue that medecyne. Then quod thys gentylman knele on your knees & say after me which knelyd doue and sayd after hym as he bad hym. ¶Thys getylman began & sayd thus. The sone on the sonday The sone on the sonday quod thomas. The mone on the monday The mone on the monday. the trynyte on the tewsday the trinyte on the tewsday.

This Thomas coke herynge his mayster thus mokkynge hym in an anger start vp & sayd by goddys body mokkyng churle I wyll neuer do the seruyce more. And wente forth to hys chaber to get hys gere to geder to thentent to gon thens by & by. But what for the anger that he toke with hys master for the moke that he gaue hym & what for labour that he toke to geder hys gere so shortly to geder the payne of the tothake wente from hym incontynent that his master com to hym & made hym tary styll & tolde hym that hys charme was the cause of the ease of the payn of his tothake. ¶By this tale ye may se that anger oftymys puttyth away bodely payne. A scoler of Oxford lately made master of arte come to the cyte of lodon & in polys met with the sayd mery getylma of essex which was euer dysposyd to playe many mery paieantys with whome before he had bene of famylier accoyntance and prayd hym to geue hym a sercenet typet This gentylman more lyberall of promys than of gyft grantyd hym he sholde haue one yf he wolde come to his lodgynge to the signe of the bulle without byshops gate in the next mornynge at vi of the clocke. Thys scoler thanked hym & for that nyght departed to hys lodgynge in fletestrete / & in the mornynge erely as he poynted cam to hym to the sygne of the bull / Anon as this gentylman saw hym he bad hym go with hym in to the Cite & he sholde be sped anone / which incontynent went togeder tyll she cam in to seynt laurence churhe in the Iury wher the gentylman espyed a prest raueshyd to masse & tolde the scoler that yonder is the preste that hathe the typet for you & bade hym knele downe in the pewe & he wolde speke to hym for it / And incontynent this gentilman went to the prest and sayd Syr here is a scoler and kynsman of myne greatly dyseased with the chyncowgh. I pray yow when masse ys done gyue hym iij draughtys of your chales. The prest grauted hym & turned hym to the scoler and sayd Syr I shall serue you as son as I haue sayd masse. the scoler the taryed styl & hard the masse trustig then whan the masse was done that the preste wolde geue hym his typet of sarcenet. This gentylman in the meane whyle departed out of the churche This prest whan masse was don put wyne in the chalice & cam to the scoler knelyng in the pew profferyng hym to drink of the chales. this scoler lokyd vpon hym & mused & sayd / master person wherfore profer ye me the chalyce mary quod the preste for the gentylman tolde me ye were dysesyd with the chicough & prayd me therfore that for a medcyn ye myght drynk of the chalis Nay by seynt mary quod the skolar he promysyd me ye sholdd delyuer me a typet of sercenet.

It fortuned ther was a gret varyauce betwen the bysshop of Norwhich & one mayster Skelton a poyet lauriat. In somoch that the bysshope comaunded hym that he sholde nat come in at hys gatys. This master skelton dyd absent hym selfe for a longe season but at the last he thought to do his duty to hym and studyed wayes how he myght obtayn the byshopys fauour and determynyd him selfe that he wold com to hi with some present & humble hym selfe to the byshop & gat a couple of fesants and cam to the byshoppys place & requyryd the porter he myght come in to speke wyth my lorde. this porter knowyng hys lordys pleasure wolde not suffer hym to come in at the gatys / wherfore this master skelton went on the bak syde to seke some other way to com in to the place. But the place was motid that he cowd se no waye to come ouer except in one place where there lay a longe tre ouer the motte in maner of a brydg that was fallyn downe with wynd wherfore this master skelton went a long vppon the tre to com ouer & when he was almost ouer hys fote slyppid for lake of sure fotyng & fell in to the motte vp to the myddyl but at the last he recoueryd hym selfe & aswel as he coud dryed hym selfe agayn / & sodenly cam to the byshop beyng in his hall then lately rysen from dyner which when he saw skelton comig sodely sayd to hym why thow chatyfe I warnyd the thow sholdys neuer come yn at my gatys & chargyd my porter to kepe the owt. ¶Forsoth my lorde quod skelton though ye gaue suche charge & though your gatys be neuer so suerly kept / yet it is no more possyble to kepe me owt / of yowr dorys than to kepe out crowes or pyes for I cae not in at your gatys. but I came ou the motte that I haue bene almost drownyd for my labour & shewd hys clothys how euyll he was arayed which causyd many that stode thereby to laugh a pace Then quod skelton yf it lyke your lordeshyp I haue brought yow a dysshe to your supper a cople of Fesantys. Nay quod the byshop I defy the and thy Fesantys also And wreche as thou art pyke the out of my howse for I wyll none of thy gyft. How be it with as humble wordys as he coud this skelton desyryd the byshop to be hys good lorde & to take his lytyll gyft of hym But the byshop callyd hym dawe & fole often tymys & in no wyse wolde receyue that gyft. This Skelton than consyderyng that the byshop callyd hym fole so oft sayd to one of his famyliers therby that though it were euyl to be cristynyd a fole yet it was moche worse to be confyrmyd a fole of suche a byshop for the name of confyrmacyo must nedes a byde therfore he ymagynyd how he might auoyd that cofyrmacio & musyd a whyl & at the last sayd to the byshop thus if your lordshyp knew the namys of these fesatys ye wold be cotet to take them / why caytyf quod the byshop hastely & angerly what be theyre namys Iwys my lorde quod skelton this Fesant is callyd alpha. ys. primus the fyrst. & this is callyd O that ys nouissimus the last. & for the more playn vnderstandyng of my mide. If it plese your lordshyp to take them I promyse you This Alpha is the fyrst that euer I gaue you & this O is the last that euer I wyl gyue you whyl I lyue. at the which aswer al that wer by made gret laghter & al they desyryd the byshop to be good lord to hi for hys mery conceytys at whose request or they went the byshop was cotent to take hym vnto his fauour agayn. ¶By thys ye may se that mery conceytes dothe a man moche more good than to frete hym selfe with anger and melancoly. A yoman of the kynges gard dwellyng in a vyllage besyde london had a very fayre yonge wyfe. To whom a carter of the towne a tal felowe resorted / & lay with her dyuers tymes whan her husband was from home / & so openly knowe that all the town spake therof / wherfor ther was a yong man of the towne well accoynted with this yema of gard that tolde hym that suche a carter had layne by his wyfe. To whome thys yeman of garde sayd & sware by godys body that yf he met hym it shold cost hym his lyfe. Mary quod the yong man yf ye go streyght euyn now the hye way ye shall ouertak hym dryuig of a cart ladyn with hay toward london wherfore this yeman of garde incontynent rode after this carter / & within short space ouertoke hym & knew hym well ynough / & incotynent called the carter to hym & sayd thus Sirra I vnderstand that thou dost ly euery night with my wyfe when I am from home This carter beyng no thyng afrayd of the other / answered ye mary what than / what than quod the yeman of garde / by goddes hart haddest thou na tolde me the trouth I wolde haue broken thy hede. And so the yeman of garde retourned and no hurte done nor stroke stryken nor profered. ¶By thys ye may se that the greatest crakers somtyme whan it cometh to the prose be moste cowardys. In the towne of Bottelley dwelled a mylner whiche had a good homely wench to his doughter whom a curat of the next towne louyd / and as the fame went had her at his plesure. ¶But on a tyme this curat preched of these curyous wyues now a dayes / & whether it were for the nones or whether it come out at all aduenturys he hapned to say thus in his sermo. ¶Ye wyues ye be so curious in all your warkes that ye wote nat what ye mene / but ye shold folowe our lady. For our lady was nothynge so curyous as ye be / but she was a good homly wenche lyke the mylners doughter of bottellay. At which sayng all the paryshons made gret laughynge / & specyally they that knewe that he loued the same wenche. ¶By thys ye may se it is great foly for a man that is suspected with any parson to prayse or to name the same parson openly lest it bryng hym forther in sclaunder. A fole there was that dwellyd with agetylma i the contray whiche was callyd a great tyraunt and an extorcyoner. But this fole louyd his master meruelously because he cheryshyd hym so well. It happenyd vppon a seasone one of the gentylmans seruauntys sayde to the fole. as they talkyd of sermon matters / by my trowth Iak quod he wolde to god that thou and I were both of vs in heuyn. Nay by lady quod the fole I wyll not go to heuyn for I had leuer go to hell than the other askyd hym why he had leuer go to hell By my trouth quod the fole for I wyll go with my master & I am sure my master shall go to hell / For euery man seyth he shall go to the deuyll of hell therefore I wyll go thyther with hym. There was a certayn ploughmannys sonne of the contrey of the age ofe .xvj. yeres that neuer come moche among company but alwey wet to plough and husbandry / on a tyme this yong lad wet to aweddynge with hys fader where he see one lute vppon a lute And when he came home agayne at nyght his moder askyd hym what sporte he hade at weddynge. This lad answeryd and sayd by my trouth moder quod he ther was one that brought in a gose betwene hys armys and tykled her so vppo the nek that she crekyd the swetlyest that euer I hard gose creke in my lyfe In a marchauntys house in london there was a mayd whiche was gotten with chylde to whome the mastres of the house came & chargyd her to tell her who was the fader of the chylde. To whome the mayden answeryd forsoth no body / why quod the maystres yt ys not possyble but some mane muste be the fader thereof. To whome the mayd sayd / why mastres why may not I haue a chylde without a man aswell as a hen to lay eggys wythout a cok. ¶Here ye may se it is harde to fynde a woman wythout an excuse. A gentylman there was dwellynge nygh kyngston vppon Temys. rydynge in the contrey wyth his seruante which was not the most quyckyst felow But rode alway sadly by hys mayster and hade very few wordys / Hys mayster sayde to hym Iohn quod he why rydyst so sadly I wold haue the tell me som mery talys to passe the tyme with by my trouth master quod he I can tell no talys / why quod the master cast not syng. no by my trouth quod hys seruaunt I cowd neuer syng in all my lyfe / why quod the master canst thou ryme than By my trouth master quod he. I can not tell but yf ye wyll beginne to ryme I wyl folow as well as I can by my trouthe quod the master that is well sayd than I wyll begyn to make a ryme let me se howe well thou canst folowe / so the master musyd a whyle and than began to ryme thus. Many mennys swannes swymmys in temmys and so do myne. ¶Then quod the seruaunt. And manny men lye by other mennys wyues and so do I by thyne / what dost horson quod the master / by my trouth master nothynge quod he but make vp the ryme. but quod the master I charge the tell me why thou sayst so / forsothe master quod he for nothynge in the worlde but to make vp your ryme. Then quod the master yf thou do it for nothyng ellys I am content / So the master forgaue hym his saynge all though he had sayd trewth. A knyghte in Myddylsex had a seruaunt which had commytted a felony wherof he was endyted / and because the terme drew nye he fered he sholde be shortly arayned therof & in ieoperdye of his lyfe. wherfor in all the haste sent a letter by a walchma a seruaut of hys vnto the kynges Iustyce of the kynges bench requyrynge hym to owe his lawfull fauour to hys seruant and comaunded hys seruant shortly to brynge hym an answere / This walche man came to the chefe Iustyce place and at the gate sawe an ape syttynge there in a cote made for hym as they vse to apparel apys for dysport / This walchman dyd of hys cap & made curtesy to the ape and sayd my master recomendeth hym to my lorde your fader & sendeth hym here a letter. Thys ape toke thys letter and opened it and loked theron / and after loked vpon the man makyng many mockes and mowes as the properte of apys is to do / this welchman becawse he vnderstode hym nat came agayn to his master accordyng to his comaundement and sayde he had delyuered the letter vnto my Lorde chefe Iustyces sonne whiche sat at the gate in a furred cote / Anone his master asked hym what answere he had whiche sayd he gaue hym an answere but it was outher Frenche or Latyn for he vnderstode hym nat / but syr quod he ye nede nat to fear for I sawe by his countenance so moche that I warant you he wyll do your errand surely to my lorde hys fader. Thys gentylman in trust therof made none other labour. For lacke wherof hys seruant that had done the felony within two dayes after was rayned at the kynges benche & cast and afterwarde hangyd. ¶By this ye may se that euery wyse man ought to take hede that he sende no folysshe seruant vpon a hasty message that is a mater of weyght. A certayne felow there was which proffered a dagger to sell to a felowe of his whiche answered hym and sayde that he had right nought to geue hym therfor. wherfor the other sayd that he shold haue his dagger vpon condycyon that he shoulde geue and delyuer vnto hym therfore within vi. dayes after right nought / or els xl. shilynges in money / wherto this other was content. This bargeyn thus agreyd he that sholde delyuer thys ryght nought toke no thought vntyll suche tyme that the day apoynted drewe nye. At the whiche tyme be began to Immagyne how he myght gyue hym right nought. And fyrst of all he thought on a feder / a strawe / a pynnes poynte / and suche other. But nothynge coud he deuyse but that it was somwhat / wherfore he come home al sad & pensyfe for sorow of lesynge of his xl. shyllynges / & coud nouther slepe nor take rest / wherof his wyfe beynge agreuyd demauded the cawse of his heuynes / whiche at the last after many denayes tolde her all. well syr quod she let me herewith alone & gete ye furthe a towne / and I shall handle this well ynough. This man folowynge his wyues councell went forthe of the towne & let his wyfe shyft. ¶This woman than henge vp an yerthen pot wherof the botom was out vpon the wall by a corde. And whan this other man come & asked for the good man she sayd that he was nat within / But Syr quod she I know your erand wel ynough / For I wote well ye wold haue of myn husbonde xl. shyllynges because he can nat delyuer to you this day right nought / Therfore syr quod she put your hande into yonder potte and take your money / this man beyng glad thrust hir hande in supposyng to haue taken xl. shyllynges of money & thrust his hand vp thrugh vp to the elbow / quod the wyfe than Syr what haue ye there. Mary quod he Ryght nought. Syr quod she than haue ye your bargeyn & than my husbond hath contentyd you for his dagger accordynge to his promyse. ¶By this ye may se that often tymes a womans wyt at an extremyte is moche better than a mannys. There was a certayn limytour which went a limytige to a certeyn vyllage wherin dwelled a certayn ryche man of whome he neuer cowde gette the valew of an halfpeny / yet he thought he wolde go thyder agayn to assay theym. And as he went thyderward the wyfe stondynge at the dore perceyuynge hym comynge a farre of thought that he wolde come thyder and by & by ran in & bad her chyldren standyng at the dore that yf the frere asked for her say she was nat within The frere saw her ron in and suspected the cawse and come to the dore and asked for the wyfe / the shyldren as they were byddyn / sayde that she was not within / than stode he styl lokyng on the chyldren / and at the last he called to hym the eldest & bad hym let him se his hande / and whan he had sene his hande O Ihesu quod he what fortune for the is ordeyned / Than called he the seconde sonne to se his hande / and his hande sene the frere sayde / O lord what a desteny is for the prepayred. Than loked he in the thyrd sones hand / suerly quod he thy desteny is hardest of all / & therwith wente he his way. The wyfe herynge these thynges sodenly ran out and called the frere agayne / and first made hym to come in / and after to syt downe and set before hym the best mete that she had / and whan he had well etyn & dronken she besought hym to tell her the destenyes of her chyldren / which at the last after many denayes tolde her that the fyrst sholde be a beggar. The second a thefe. The third an homycyd / whiche she heryng fell downe in a sowne & toke it greuously. The frere conforted her and sayd / that though these were theyr fortune yet there myghte be remedy had. Than she besought hym of his counsell. Than sayd the frere ye must make the eldest that shalbe a begger a frere. and the second that shalbe a thefe a man of law / & the third that shalbe an homycyde / a phisycyon. ¶By this ye may lerne that they that wyll come to the speche or Presence of any parson for theyr owne cawse they must fyrst endeuer theyme selfe to shewe suche maters as those parsons moste delyte in. A certeyn frere had a boy that euer was wont to bere this freres money and on a tyme whan the boy was farre behynde his master as they two walked togeder by the way there met a man the frere whiche knewe that the boy bare the frerys money and sayde.

A certayn bocher dwellyng in saynt Nicholas fleshamels in london callyd Poule had a seruaut callyd Peter. This Peter on a sonday was at ye chirche heryng masse & one of his felawes whose name was Phylip spencer was sent to call hym at the comaundement of his mayster. So it happened at the tyme that the curat prechyd. And in his sermon touched many auctorytees of the holy scrypture. Amonge all the wordes of the pystell of saynt Poule ad philippenses / that we be not onely bounde to beleue in cryst but also to suffer for crystys sake & sayd these wordes in ye pulpet / what sayth Poule ad philippenses to this. This yoge man yt was called Philip spencher had went he had spoken of hym answered shortely & sayd / mary syr he bad Peter come home & take his parte of a podyng for he sholde go for a calfe anone. The curat heryng this was abashyd & all the audyence made grete laughter. ¶By this tale ye may lerne that it is no token of a wyse man to gyue a sodayne answere to a questyo before that he knowe suerly what the matter is. There came a courtyer by a carter the whiche in derysyon preysed the carters bak legges and other members of his body meruelously whose gestyng the carter perceyued & sayd he had another properte than ye courtyer espyed in hym / & whan the courtyer had demauded what it sholde be / he loked asyde ouer his sholder vpon the courtyer & sayd thus / lo syr this is my properte. ¶I haue a wall eye in my hed / for I neuer loke ouer my sholder this wyse but I lyghtly espye a knaue. ¶By this tale a man maye se that he that vsed to deryde and mocke other folkys / is somtyme hym selfe more deryded & mocked. A yong ma of ye age of .xx. yere rude & vnlernyd in ye tyme of let ca to his curat to be tofessyd whiche whe he was of his lyfe serched & examyned coude not say his Pater noster / wherfore his cofessour exorted hym to lerne his Pater noster / & shewed hym what an holy & goodly prayer it was / & the effect therof / & the .vii. petycyons therin coteyned.

A certayn frere there was whiche vpo our lady day the Annucyacyon made a sermon in the whyte frerys in London / and began his anteteme this wyse / Aue maria gracia plena dominus tecu / &c. ¶These wordes quod the frere were spoken by the aungel Gabryel to our lady when she coceyued Cryst / whiche is as moche to say in our moder togue as all heyle Mary well thou be ye sone of god is wt the. And further more the augell sayd / thou shalt conceyue and bere a sone. And thou shalt call his name Iesum / and Elyzabeth thy swete cosyn / she shall conceyue the swete saynt Iohn. And so procedyd styll in his Sermon in suche fond tyme that dyuers & many gentylmen of the court that were there bega to smyle & laugh. The frere yt perceyuynge sayd thus Maysters I pray you harke I shall tel you a narracyo. ¶There was ones a yong preest yt was not all ye best clark sayd masse & rede a colect thus. Deus qui viginti filij tui &c. Where he sholde haue sayd vnigeniti filij tui. &c. ¶And after whe mas was done there was suche a gentylma as one of you at now yt had herde his masse came to ye preest & sayd thus. Syr I pray you tell me how many sonnys had god almyghty / quod ye preest why aske you yt. Mary syr quod ye gentylman I suppose he had .xx. sonnys / for ye sayd ryght now. Deus qui viginti filii tui . The preest perceyuyng how yt he derydyd hym answerde hym shortly & sayd thus. How many sonnys so euer god almyghty had / I am sure yt thou art none of them for yu skornyst ye worde of god. And soo sayd the frere in the pulpet. No more ar ye none of ye chyldere of god. For ye skorne & laugh / at me now yt preche to you the worde of god. which wordys made the gentylmen and all the other people laughe moche more tha they dyd before. ¶By this tale a man may lerne to perceyue well yt the best the wysyst & ye most holyest matter yt is by found pronunciacyon & vtterauce may be marryd / nor shall nor edyfye to ye audyece. Therfore euery proces wolde be vtteryd with wordys & cotenauce couenyent to the matter. ¶Also yet by this tale they that be vnlernyd in ye latyn tongue maye knowe the sentence of the aue maria. In a vyllage in warwyck shere there was a paryshe preest & thoughe he were no gret clark nor graduat of ye vnyuersyte / yet he prechyd to his paryshons vpo a sonday / declaryng to the ye .xii. artycles of the Crede. shewynge them that the fyrst artycle was to beleue in god the fader almyghty maker of heuen & erth.

The fyft that he descendyd to hel & fet out ye good sowlys yt were in fayth & hope / and that he ye thyrd day rose from deth to lyfe. The syxth he assendyd in to heuen to ye ryght syde of god ye fader wher he syttyth. The seuenth yt he shall come at the day of dome to Iudge both vs that be quyk & them that be dede. The eyght to beleue in the holy goost equall god wt the fader & the sone. The nynth in holy chyrche Catholyke & in ye holy comunyo of sayntys. The tenth In ye remyssyon of synnes. The leuynth In the resurreccyo generall of ye body & soule. The twelfth In euerlastynge lyfe that god shall reward the that be good. And sayd to his paryshons further yt these artycles ye be bounde to beleue for they be trew & of auctoryte. And yf you beleue not me / the for a more suerte & suffycyet auctoryte / go your way to couentre / and there ye ye shall se them all playd in corpus cristi playe. ¶By redyng of this tale they yt vnderstode no latyn may lerne to knowe the .xii. articles of the fayth. A limitour of the gray frerys in London whiche prechyd in a certayn vyllage in the countrey in the tyme of his lymitacyo / & had but one sermo which he had lerned by hart yt was of ye declaryng of the .x. comaudemetes. The fyrst to beleue in one god / & to honour hym aboue all thynge. The secod to swere not in vayn by hym nor none other of his creatures. The thyrde to absteyne from wordly operacyo on ye holy day thou & all thy seruantys of who thou hast charge. The fourthe to honor thy paretys & helpe the in theyr necessyte.

Then quod the frere I praye the reherse the vnto me now. Mary quod ye seruaut these be they. Pryde Couetyse Slouth Enuy wrath Glotony and Lechery. ¶By redynge this tale ye maye lerne to knowe the .x. comaundementes and the .vii. dedely synnes. The husbande sayde to his wyfe thus / wyfe by this candell I dremed this nyght that I was a cokcolde. To whome she answered and sayd husbonde. By this brede ye are none. The sayd he / wyfe ete the brede. She answerd & sayd to her husbande / then ete you the candell for you sware fyrst. ¶By this a man may se that a womans answere is neuer to seke. A woman demaudyd a questyon of a yong chyld sonne vnto a ma of lawe of what craft his fader was / which chyld sayd his fader was a crafty man of lawe. ¶By this tale a man may perceyue that sometyme peraduenture yoge Innocentys speke truely vnaduysed. In a certayn parysh chyrche in London after the olde lawdable & accustomyd maner there was a frere mynor all thoughe he were not the best clarck nor coude not make the best sermon / yet by the lycence of the curat he there preched to the paryshons. Among the whiche audyence there was a wyfe at that tyme lytyll dysposyd to contemplacyo talkyd with a gosyp of hers of other feminyne tales / so loud that the frere hard & somwhat was perturbyd therwith. To whom therfore openly the frere spake & sayd. Thou woman there in the tawny gow / hold thy peace & leue thy babelyng thou troblyst the worde of god. ¶This woman there with sodeynly abashyd bycause ye frere spake to her so openly yt al ye people her beheld answeryd shortly & sayd / I beshrewe hye hard that babelyd more of vs two. At ye whyche seyng ye people dyd laugh bycause they felt but lytyll fruyte in his sermon. ¶By this tale a man may lerne to be ware how he openly rebukyth any other & in what audyence lest it tourne to his owne reprofe. In the rayne of the most myghty and vyctoryous Prynce kynge Henry the .viii. cruell warre began betwene Englysshe men Frenshemen / & Skottys. The Englysshemen were so myghty vpon ye se that none other people of other realmys were able to resyst the / wherfore they toke many grete enterprysys / & many shyppys / & many prysoners of other remys yt were theyr enmys. Among the which they happenyd on a season to take a skottys shyp. & dyuers skottys they slew & toke prysoners Among whom ther was a welchma that had one of the skottys prysoner & bad hym that he shold do of his harnes / which to do the Skot was very loth / howbeyt for fere at ye last he pullyd it of wt an yuyll wyll / & sayde to ye welchma / yf thou wilt nedys haue my harnes take it there / & cast it ouer the bord in to the se. The welchman seyng that sayd. By Cottes blut & her nayll. I shal make her fat it agayn. And toke hym by ye legges & cast hym after ouer the bord in to the se. ¶ By this tale a man maye lerne yt he that is subget to another ought to forsake his owne wyll / & folow his wyll & comaudement yt so hath subieccyon ouer hym / lest it torne to his gretter hurt & damage. There was a man that maryed a woman whiche hath grete ryches & bewte / how be it she had suche an impedyment of nature that she was dome and coude not speke / whiche thynge made hym full ofte to be ryght pesyfye & sad / wherfore vpon a daye as he walkyd alone ryght heuy in hart thynkig vpo his wyfe. There came one to hym & askyd hym what was the cause of his heuynes / which answeryd that is was onely bycause his wyfe was borne dome. To who this other sayd. I shall shewe ye soone a remedy & a medycyn therfore that is thus. Go take an aspen lefe & lay it vnder her togue this nyght she beyng a slepe / & I warrant the yt she shall speke on the morow / whiche man beyng glad of this medycyne preparyd therfore / & gatheryd aspen leues. Wherfore he layd .iii. of them vnder her toge whe she was a slepe. And vpon ye morowe whe he hym self wakyd he desyrous to know how his medycyne wroughte beyng in bed wt her he demaunded of her how she dyd / & sodenly she answeryd & sayd. I beshrewe your hart for wakynge me so erly / & so by vertew of yt medycyne she was restored to her speche. ¶But in coclusyon her speche so incresyd day by day & she was so curst of codycyo that euery day she braulyd & chyde with her husbande so moche yt at ye last he was more vexyd and had moche more troble & dyssease with her shrewed wordes then he had before whan she was dome. ¶Wherfore as he walked another tyme alone he happened to mete agayne with the same person that taught hym the sayde medycyne. And sayde to hym this wyse ¶Syr ye taught me a medycyne but late to make my dome wyfe to speke. Byddyng me laye an aspen lefe vnder her tonge when she slepte. And I layd .iii. aspen leues there. wherfore now she speketh. But yet she speketh so moche and so shrewdly that I am more wery of her now than I was before when she was dome. ¶Wherfore I praye you teche me a medycyne to modyfye her that she speke not so moche. ¶This other answeryd and sayd thus. Syr I am a deuyll of hell. But I am one of them that haue leest power there. Albeyt yet I haue power to make a woman to speke. But yet yf a woman begyn ones to speke / I nor all the dyuels in helle that haue the most power be not able to make a woman to be styll / nor to cause her to leue her spekynge. ¶By this tale ye may note that a man oftymes desyreth and coueteth to moche that thynge that oft torneth to his dysplesure. One askyd a proctoure of the Arches lately before maryed why he chase hym so lytell a wyfe / whiche answerde because he had a text saynge thus. Ex duobus malis minus malum est eliendum / that is to saye in englysshe. Amonge euyll thynges the lest is to be chosen. In the tyme of lente there cam two nonnys to saynt Iohns in london bycause of the greate pardon there to be confessyd. Of ye whiche nonnys the one was a yonge lady & the other was olde. This yonge lady chose fyrst her Confessoure / and confessyd her that she had synned in Lechery. The confessoure asked wt whom it was. She sayde it was with a lusty Gallat. He demaudyd where it was. She sayd in a pleasaunt grene herber. He askyd further whe it was. She sayd in ye mery moneth of May. Then sayd ye confessour this wyse. A fayre yonge lady / with a lusty gallant / in a pleasaunt herber / in ye mery moneth of May / ye dyd but your kynde. Now by my trouth god forgyue you & I do. ¶And so she departed and incotynent the olde none met with her askynge her how she lyked her confessour / whiche sayde that he was the best gostly fader yt euer she hadde And the most easyst in penaunce geuynge. ¶For cofort wherof this other nonne went to the same confessour. And shroue her lyke wyse that she had synned in Lechery. And he demaunded with whom / which sayde with an olde Frere / he askyd where. She sayd in her olde cloyster. He askyd what season. She sayd in lent. Then the confessour sayd thus. ¶An olde hore to lye with an olde frere / in the olde cloyster / in the holy tyme of Lent. By cokkys body yf god forgyue the yet wyll I neuer forgyue the. ¶Whiche wordys causyd her to departe all sad and sore abasshyd. ¶By this tale men may lerne that a vycyouse acte is more abhomynable in one person than in an other / in one season than in an other and in one place than in an other. When the most noble and fortunate prynce kynge Edwarde of Englonde made warre in Fraunce with a greatte puyssaunce and Armye of People. ¶Whome the Frenche kynge with a nother grete host incounteryd. And when bothe ye hostis shulde Ioyne & the trumpettis began to blow / a yong squyer of englonde rydyng on a lusty courser of whiche horse the noyse of ye trupettys so prykkyd ye courage yt the squyer coude not hym retayne / so that agaynst his wyll he ran vpon his enemys whiche squyer seynge none other remedy set his spere in the rest / and rode through the thykkyst of his enemys / & inconclusyon had good fortune and sauyd hymselfe alyue without hurt / & the englysh host folowed & had the vyctory. And after when ye felde was done this kyng Edwarde called the squyer / & bad hym knele downe for he wolde make hym knyght / because yt he valyauntly was ye men yt day which with the most couragyouse stomak aduenturyd fyrst vpon theyr enemys. To whom ye squyre thus answerde. Yf it lyke your grace to make any body knyght therfore / I beseche you to make my horse knyght & not me / for certes it was his dede & not myne / & full sore agaynst my wyll. ¶Whiche answere the kynge herynge refraynyd to promote hym to the order of knyghthode / reputynge hym in maner but a cowarde / & euer after fauoryd hym the lesse. ¶By this tale a man may lerne how it is wysdome for one that is in good credence to kepe hym therin / and in nowyse to dysable hymselfe to moche. A yonge man late maryed to a wyfe thowght it was good polycy to get the maystry of her in the begynnynge. Cam to her the pot sethynge ouer ye fyre all though the mete therin were not inough sodenly comaundyd her to take the pot from the fyre. whyche answeryd & sayde that ye mete was not redy to ete. And he sayd agayne I wyll haue it taken of for my pleasure. This good woman loth yet to offend hym set ye pot besyde the fyre / as he had. And anone after he comauded her to set the pot behynde the dore / & she sayd therto agayne ye be not wyse therin. But he precisely sayd it sholde be so as he bad. And she gentylly agayne dyd his comaudement. This man yet not satysfyed comaunded her to set the pot a hygh vpon the hen rost / what quod ye wyf agayne I trow ye be mad. And he fyersly than comaunded her to set it there or els he sayd she sholde repet She somewhat aferde to mone his pacience toke a ladder and set it to the roost / and wet herself vp the ladder and toke the pot in her hande prayeng her husbande than to holde the ladder fast for slydynge whiche so dyd. ¶And whenne the husbande lokyd vp and sawe the Potte stande there an hyght he sayd thus. Lo now standyth the pot there as I wolde haue it This vyfe herynge that sodenly pouryd the hote potage on his hed & sayd thus. And now bene the potage there as I wolde haue them. ¶By this tale men may se it is no wysedome for a man to attempte a meke womas pacyece to far lest it torne to his owne hurte & dammage A certayne confessour in the holy tyme of lente inioyned his penitent to say dayly for his penaunce this prayer. ¶Agnus dei miserere mei / whiche was as moche to saye in englysshe as ye Lambe of god haue mercy vpon me. This penitens acceptynge his penauce departyd & that tyme twelfe moneth after came agayne to be confessyd of the same cofessoure whiche demaundyd of hym whether he had fulfyllyd his penauce that he hym inioynyd ye last yere. And he sayd thus / ye syr I thank god I haue fulfylled it / for I haue sayde thus to daye mornynge and so dayly. The shepe of god haue mercy vpon me. To whom the confessour sayd. Nay I bad ye say Agnus dei miserere mei / that is ye lambe of god haue mercy vpon me. ¶Ye syr quod ye penytent ye say trouth that was ye laste yere / but now it is at twelfe month syth / & it is a shepe by this tyme. Therfore I must nedys say now ye shepe of god haue mercy vpon me. ¶By this tale ye may perceyue that yf holy scrypture be expownyd to rude Lay people onely in the lytterall scence. Peraduenture it shal do but lytell good. It fourtuned dyuers to be in comunycacyon amonge whom there was a curat or a parysh preest & one Iohan daw a paryshon of his whiche .ii. had comunycacyon more busy than other in this maner This preest thought yt one myght not by felynge knowe one from another in the darke / Iohn daw his paryshon of contrary opynyon layde with his curate for a wager .xl. pence. ¶Wherupon the parysh preest wyllynge to proue his wager wente to this Iohn dawes house in the euenynge and sodenly gate hym to bed with his wyfe where whe he began to be somwhat besy. She felynge his crowne sayde shortly with a loude voyce. By god thou art not Iohn daw. That herynge her husbond answerde. Thou sayst trouth wyfe I am here Iohn daw. Therfore mayster person gyue me the money for ye haue lost your .xl. pence. ¶By this tale ye may lerne to perceyue yt it is no wysdome for a man for ye couetouse of wynnyng of any wager to put in Ieoperdy a thyng that may torne hym to gretter dysplasure. A rych frankelyn in ye contrey hauynge by his wyfe but one chyld and no mo for the grete affeccyon that he had to his sayde chylde founde hym at Oxford to scole by the space of .ii. or .iii. yere. This yonge scoller in a vocacyon tyme for his dysport came home to his fader. ¶It fortuned afterwarde in a nyght the fader ye moder & the sayde yonge scoller syttynge at supper hauynge before them no more mete but onely a cople of chykyns the fader sayd this wyse. Sone so it is that I haue spent moch money vpon the to fynde ye to scole / wherfore I haue grete desyre to know what hast lernyd. To whom ye sone answerde & sayde. Fader I haue studyed souestrye & by that scyence I can proue yt these .ii. chykyns in ye dysh be thre chykyns. Mary sayd ye fader that wolde I fayne se. The scoller toke one of ye chykyns in his hand & sayd. Lo here is one chykyn / and incotynent he toke both ye chykyns in his hand ioyntly & sayd here is .ii. chykyns and one & .ii. maketh .iii. Ergo here is .iii. chykyns. Then ye fader toke one of the chykyns to hymselfe and gaue another to his wyfe & sayd thus. Lo I wyll haue one of ye chykyns to my parte / & thy moder shall haue another & bycause of thy good argument thou shalt haue ye thyrde to thy supper / for thou getteyst no more mete here at this tyme / whiche promyse the fader kept & so the scoller went without his supper. ¶By this tale men may se that it is grete foly to put one to scole to lerne any subtyll scyence whiche hath no naturall wytte A frere of london there was that on a sondaye mornynge yarly in ye somer seaso came from Londo to Barnet to make a colacyon / & was there an houre before hye masse began / & bycause he wolde come to ye chyrch honestly / he went fyrst to an alehouse there to wype his shoys & to make hymself clenely. In the which house there were podyngis to selle / & dyuers folkys there brekynge theyr faste & etyng podyngys. But ye frere brake his fast in a secrete place in ye same hous. ¶This frere soone after came to the chyrch and by lycence of ye curat enteryd in to the pulpet to make a colacyon or sermon. And in his sermon there he rebukyd sore ye maner of them that vsyd to breke theyr fast on the sonday before hye masse & sayd it was called ye dyuyls blak brekfast. And with that worde spekyng as he dyd cast his armys out to make his coutenauce there fell a podynge out of his sleue / which he hymself had stole a lytel before in ye same alehous & when ye people sawe that & specyally they yt brake theyr fast there ye same mornyng & knew wel that ye wyfe had compleyned how she had one of her podynges stolyn / they laughyd so moche at the frere yt he incotynent went downe of the pulpet for shame. ¶By this tale a man may se that whe a precher doth rebuke any synne or vyce wherin he is knowe openly to be gylty hymself / suche prechyng shall lytell edyfy to the people. A certayne skoller ther was intendynge to be made prest whiche had nother grete wytte nor lernyng came to the bysshop to take orders / whos folyshnesse ye byshop perceyuyng because he was a ryche manes son wolde not very strongly appose hym but askyd hym this small questyon. Noe had .iij. sonnes / Sem / Cham & Iaphet / now tell me quod ye bysshop wo was Iaphetis father & thou shalt haue orders. Then sayd ye scoler By my trouth my lorde I pray you pardo me. For I neuer lernyd but lytell of the byble. Then quod the bysshop / go home & come agayn & soyle me this questyon & thou shalt haue orders. ¶This scoler so departed & came home to his fader & shewde hym ye cause of the hynderaunce of his orders. ¶His fader beynge angry at his folysshnes thought to teche hym ye solucyon of this questyon by a famylyer example & called his spanyels before hym & sayd thus / thou knowyst well Coll my dogge hath these iii. whelpys Ryg / Tryg / & Tryboll Must not Coll my dog nedys be Syre to tryboll. Then quod the scoler by god fader ye saye trouth let me alone now / ye shall se me do well ynough ye nexte tyme. wherfore on ye morowe he wente to ye bysshop agayne & sayd he coud soyle his questyon. Then sayd the bysshop Noe had .iii. sonnes Sem Cham & Iaphet / now tell me who was Iaphetys fader Mary syr quod ye scoler yf it please your lordshyp Col my faders dog. ¶By this tale a man may lerne that it is but lost tyme to teche a fole any thynge whych hath no wyt to perceyue it. It fortuned so that a frere late in the euenynge desyred lodgynge of a poore man of the countrey / the whiche for lake of other lodgynge glad to herborowe the frere lodgyd hym in his owne bed. And after he and his wyfe. The frere beynge a sleepe came and lay in the same bedde. ¶And in the mornynge after the poore man rose and wente to the marketh leuynge the Frere in ye bedde with his wyfe And as he went he smyled & laughyd to hymselfe / wherfore his neybours demaunded of hym why he so smyled / he answerd & sayd I laugh to thynk how shamefast the frere shall be when he waketh / whom I left in bedde with my wyfe. ¶By this tale a man may lerne that he that ouershotyth hymself doth folyshly yet he is more fole to shewe it openly. Somtyme there dwellyd a prest in Stretforth vpon auyne of small lernynge whiche vndeuoutly sange masse / & often tymes twyse on one day. So it happened on a tyme after his secode mas was done in shoterey not a myle from Strethforth there mete with hym dyuers merchaunt men whiche wolde haue harde masse / & desyred hym to synge masse and he sholde haue a grote / whiche answerd them & sayd Syrs I wyll say masse no more this day / but I wyl say you .ii. gospels for one grote / & that is dog chepe a masse in ony place in englonde. ¶By this tale a man may se that they that be rude & vnlernyd regard but lytell the meryt & goodnes of holy prayer. A courtyer & a frere happenyd to mete togyder in a fery bote & in comunycacyon betwene them fell at wordys angry & dyspleasyd eche with other / & fought & strogled togyder / so that at the last ye courtyer cast the frere ouer the bote / so was ye frere drowned. The feryma whiche had ben a man of warre the most parte of his lyfe before and seynge the frere was so drowned & gon sayde thus to the courtyer / I beshrewe thy hart thou sholdest haue taryed & foughte with hym a lande for nowe thou hast caused me to lese an halfpeny for my fare. ¶By this tale a man may se that he yt is accostumed in vycyous & cruel company shall lose that noble vertew to haue pyte & compassyon vpon his neyghboure. A precher in the pulpet whiche prechyd the worde of god / & amog other matters spake of mennys soullys & sayd they were so meruelous & so subtyll yt a thousand soullys myght dauce in the space of a nayle of a mannys fynger / amonge whiche audyence there was a mery conceyted felowe of small deuocyon that answerde and sayd thus / mayster doctor yf that a thousande soullys may daunce on a mannys nayle I pray you tell then where shall the pyper stande. ¶By this tale a man may se that it is but foly to shewe or to teche vertew to them that haue no pleasure nor mynde therto. In londo there was a certayn artyfycer hauyng a fayre wyf to who a lusty galat made pursute to accomplyshe his pleasur. This woma denyenge shewde the matter vnto her husbande / whiche mouyd therwith bad his wyfe to appoynte hym a tyme to come secretly to lye with her all night. And wt gret krakys & othes sware yt agaynst his lyf execept coming he wolde be redy harnesyd & wolde put hym in ieoperdy of his comyng he wolde make hym a grete amendys. This nyght was them appoynted at whiche tyme this courtyer came at his howre & entred into the chaumber set his two handsworde downe & sayde these wordes. Stand thou there thou sworde the deth of .iii. men. ¶This husbande lyenge vnder ye bed in harnes heryng these wordes lay styl for fere. The courtyer anone gat him to bed with the wyfe aboute his prepensyd besynes / and within an houre or .ii. the husbande beynge wery of lyenge began to remoue hym / the courtyar that herynge askyd the wyfe what thynge that was yt remouyd vnder ye bed / whiche excusynge ye matter sayde it was a lytell shepe that was wonte dayly to go about the hous & the husbande yt herynge anone cryed ble as it had ben a shepe. ¶And so incoclusyon when ye courtyer saw his tyme he rose & kyssed the wyfe & toke his leue & departyd. And as soone as he was gone the husbande arose / & when the wyfe lokyd on hym somwhat abasshyd she began to make a sad coutenaunce & sayde Alas syr why dyd ye not ryse & play the man as ye sayde ye wolde / whiche answerde and sayde why dame dydest thou not here hym say that his sworde had ben the dethe of .iii. men / & I had ben a fole than yf yt I had put my selfe in ieopardy to haue ben the fourth.

In ye tyme of vysytacyo a bysshop whiche was somwhat lecherous & had got many chylderne preparyd to come to a prestes house to se what rule he kept which prest had a lema in his house called Ede & by her had .ii. or .iii. smale chyldre in short space / but agayn ye bysshop commyng ye prest preparyd a rome to hyde his lema & his childre ouer in ye rofe of his hall / & whe ye bysshop was come & set at dyner in ye same hal hauyng .x. of his owne childre about hym this preste which coud speke lytell latyn or none bad the bysshop in latyn to ete saynge Comede episcope.

This bysshop herynge this vxor tua sicut vitis abundans in lateribus domus tue. The preest the half amasyd answeryd shortly and sayd Filii tui sicut nouelle olyuarum in circuitu mense tue . By this ye may se that they that haue but small lernynge somtyme speke truely vnaduysyd. On ashe wednysday in ye mornynge was a curat of a chyrch whiche had made good chere the nyght afore / & syttyn vp late & came to ye chyrche to here cofessyon to whom there came a woman / and amoge other thyngys she cofessyd her that she had stolyn a pot.

This mayster whyttento then thought that when our lady sholde come to hym she wolde gyue hym all the hole glas bycause yt he had bylded such a gret colege & was very glad in his mynd. But whe our lady cam to hym she asked hym what he had suffred for her sake / which wordys made hym gretly abashyd bycause he had nothyng to say for hym selfe / & so he dremyd that for all the gret dede of byldyng of ye sayd Colege he had no parte of yt goodly oyntement. ¶By this ye mnay se that to suffer for goddys sake is more merytoryous than to gyue gret goodys. A certayne bysshop appoynted to go on vysytacyon to a prestys hous and bycause he wolde haue the preest do but lytell cost vpon hym he bad hym dresse but lytyl mete sayng thus in latyn. Preparas mihi modicu This prest which vnderstode hym not halfe wel had a horse called modicu wherfore he thought to obtayne the bysshops fauour & agaynst ye bysshops comyng kylled his horse that was called modicum wherof the byssop & his seruates ete part which whe ye bisshop knew afterward was gretly displesid ¶By this ye may se that many a fole doth moche cost which hath but lytyll thank for his laboure. A certayne maltman of colbroke whiche was a very couetous wreche and had no pleasure but onely to get money came to london to sell his malt and broughte with hym .iiii. capons & there reseyuyd .iiii. or .v. li. for malte and put it in a lytell purs tyed to his cote and after wente aboute the strettys to sell his capons whom a pollyng felowe that was a dycer and an vnthryft had espyed and Imagyned how he myght begyle the man other of his capons or of his money and came to this maltman in the street berynge these capons in his hande and askyd hym how he wolde sell his capons and when he had shewyd hym the pryse of them he bad hym go with hym to his mayster and he wolde shew them to his mayster and he wolde tause hym to haue money for them wherto he agreed. This Poller wente to the cardynalls hat in lomberdys strete & when he came to the dore he toke the capons from the maltman and bad hym tary at the dore tyll he had shewed his mayster and he wolde come agayn to hym and brynge hym his money for them. This poller when he had goten the capons wente in to the house and wente thorowe the other bak entre in to Cornhyll and soo toke the capons with hym / and when this maltman had stond there a good season he askid one of the tauerners where the man was that had the Capons to shewe to his mayster / mary quod the tauerner I can not tell the here is nother mayster nor man in this house for this entre here is a comen hye way and gooth in to cornhyl I am sure he is gone aweye with thy capos. This maltman herynge that ran throwe the entre in to cornhyll and askyd for a felowe in a tawny cote that had capons in his hand. But no man coude tell hym whiche waye he was gone and soo the maltman loste his capons and after wente in to his Inne all heuy and sade and toke his horse to thentent to ryde home. This poller by that tyme had chaungyd his rayment and borowyd a furryd gowne and came to the maltman syttynge on horsback and sayd thus good man me thought I harde the inquire euyn now for one in a tawny cote that had stolyn from the .iiii. capos yf thou wylt gyue me a quart of wyne go with me and I shall brynge ye to a place where he syttyth drynkyng with other felowes & had ye capons in his hande. This maltman beynge glad therof grautyd hym to gyue hym the wyne bycause he semyd to be an honest man / and went wt hym vnto the dagger in chepe. This poller then sayd to hym go thy way streyght to thend of yt long entre & there thou shalt se whether it be he or no & I wyl holde thy horse here tyll thou come agayn This maltman thynkyng to fynde the felow with his capos wet in & left his horse with the other at the dore. And as soone as he was gon in to the house this poller lad the horse awaye in to his owne lodgynge. This malt man inqueryd in the house for his felowe with the capons but no man coude tell hym no tydyngys of suche man / wherfore he came agayne to ye dore all sad & lokyd for hym yt had his hors to kepe / & bycause he sawe hym not he askyd dyuers there for hym / & some sayd they saw hym & some sayde they saw hym not / but no man coude tell whiche waye he was gone wherfore he wente home to his Inne more sad tha he was before / wherfore his host gaue hym coucell to get hym home & beware how he trustyd any men in londo. This maltman seynge none other cofort went his hy way homewarde. ¶This poller which lyngeryd alway there aboute the Inne hard tell that the maltman was goyng homewarde a fote apparelyd hym lyke a mannys prentyse & gat a lytell boget stuffyd full of stones on his bake & wente before hym to charynge crosse & taryed tyll ye maltman came / & askyd hym whether he wente whiche sayd to Colbroke. Mary quod ye other I am glad therof for I must goo to braynforde to my mayster to bere hym money which I haue in my boget & I wolde be glad of copany. This maltman bycause of his owne money was glad of his copany / & so they agreed & wente togyder a whyle. At the last this poller went somwhat before to knyghtbryge & sat vpon ye brydge & restyd hym with his boget on his bak / & when he saw ye maltma almost at hym he let his boget fall ouer ye brydge in to ye water. & incontynent start vp & sayd to ye maltman alas I haue let my boget fal in to ye water & there is .xl. li. of money therin / yf thou wylt wade in to ye water & go seke it & get it me agayne I shall gyue ye .xii. pence for thy labour / this maltman hauynge pyte of his losse & also glad to get the .xii. pence plukyd of his hose cote & shyrt & wadyd into ye water to seke for the boget. And in ye mene whyle this poller gote his clothis & cote wherto the purs of money was tyde & lepte ouer the hedge & wente to westmynster. ¶This maltman within a whyle after with grete payne & depe wadynge founde ye boget & came out of the water & sawe not his felowe there & sawe that his clothys & money were not there as he left them suspectyd ye mater and openyd the boget and than founde nothynge therin but stonys cryed out lyke a mad man and ran all nakyd to london agayne and sayde alas alas helpe or I shall be stolen. For my capons be stolen. My hors is stolen. My money and clothys be stolen and I shall be stolen myself. And so ran aboute the stretys in london nakyd & mad cryenge alway I shall be stole. I shall be stolen. And so contynuyd mad durynge his lyfe & so dyed lyke a wretche to the vtter dystruccyon of hymselfe & shame to all his kyn. ¶By this ye may se that many a couetouse wrech yt louyd his good better than god and settyth his mynde inordynatly theron by the ryghte iugment of god of tymes comyth to a myserable and shamfull ende. A welcheman dwellynge in englonde fortuned to stele an englyshmans cok & sette it on ye fyre to seth wherfore this englyshman suspectyng ye welshma cam in to his house & sawe ye cok setyng on ye fyre & sayd to ye welchma thus.

Certayne of ye vycars of poulys dysposyd to be mery on a sondaye at hye masse tyme sent another mad felowe of theyr accoyntauce vnto a folysshe dronken preste to gyue hym a botell / whiche man met with the preste vpon the top of ye stayrys by ye chaucell dore & spake to hym & sayde thus.

This preste therwith beyng very angry all sodenly toke the botell & with his fote flange it downe in to ye body of the chyrche vpon the gentylmens hedes. A certayne Iury in the counte of Myddelsex was inpaneld for ye kynge to inquere of all indytementes murders & felonyes.

To who ye frere sodely answerd & sayd thus / but I pray ye what ca therof was he not hagid on ye fryday after which herynge all ye people in ye church fell on laughyng There was a certayne man that had two sonnys vnlyke of condycyons. For the eldyst was lusty and quyk and vsyd moche to ryse erly and walke in to the feldys / than was the yonger slowe and vnlusty and vsyd to lye in bed as longe as he myght. So on a daye the elder as he was wonte rose erly and walkyd in to the feldys and there by fortune he founde a purs of money and brought it home to his fader. His fader when he had it wente streyght to his other sone yet lyenge then in his bed & sayd to hym. O thou slogarde quod he seyst thou not thyne elder broder how he by his erly rysyng had found a purs with money whereby we shalbe gretely holpen all oure lyfe / whyle thou sluggynge in thy bed dost no good but slepe. He then wyst not what to sey but answeryd shortly and sayd fader quod he yf he that hath lost the purs and money had lyne in his bed that same tyme that he lost it as I do now my broder had founde no purs nor money to daye. ¶By this ye may se that they that be accustomyd in vyce and syn wyl alway fynd one excuse or other to cloke there with theyr vyce and vnthryftynes. A certayn wyfe there was whiche was somwhat fayre and as all women be yt be yt fayre was somwhat proude of her bewty / & as she and her mayd sat togeder she as one that was desyrous to be preysyd sayd to her thus.

A certayne alderman of London there was lately dysceased whiche now shall be nameles whiche was very couetouse as well before he was maryed as after / for when he was bacheler euer when his hosen were broken so that he coude were them no longer for shame then wolde he cutte them of by the knee and putte on a payre of ledder buskyns on his bare leggys whiche wolde laste hym a two or thre yere. Furthermore it was his maner when he was a bacheler euery nyght where that he was to borrowe a candels ende to brynge hym home whiche he wolde alway put in a chest that he had at his chamber. So that by that tyme he was maryed / he had a cheste of candels endis that wayd two or thre hondred weyghte. ¶Sone after that he was maryed to a ryche wydowe and than folkys thought he wolde be better than he was before. But so it happenyd that a gentylman gaue hym a pasty of an harte whiche euery day he caused to be sette on the table for seruyce / how beit he wolde neuer for nygynshyp let it be openyd / so that it was a moneth or vi. wekys or euer it was touched. At whiche tyme it fortuned a man of his accoynetaunce beynge there often and seynge this pasty neuer to be openyd sayde syr by my trouth I wyll tame your pasty / whiche openyd ye pasty and incontynent lepte out .iii. or .iiii. myce vpon other gentylmens trechowrs whiche had crept in at an hole vndernethe the bottam and hadde etyn vp all the mete therin. Also this alderman was of suche condycyon yt he wolde here .ii. or .iii. massys euery daye / and whan any pore folke came to begge of hym he wolde rebuke them and say that they dyde lette hym in heryng of them so that he wolde neuer gyue peny in almys. And on a tyme as he sat at saynt Thomas of Acres herynge masse he sawe a yonge begynner a dettour of his that owyd hym .xx. li. whiche as sone as he sawe hym he commaunded one of his seruauntes to get a sergyaunt & to arest hym whiche yonge man immedyatly after was arestyd / and whan he was in the counter he desyred dyuers of his frendys to intrete with this Alderma for dayes of payment whiche men in the mornynge after came to this Alderman knelynge at masse & intretyd hym for this man desyrynge hym to take dayes of paymet whiche answeryd them thus. I praye you troble me not now for I haue harde one masse all redy & I wyll here an other or I medle with worldly matters. But yf ye haue the money here I wyll take the now or elles I pray you speke to me no more / and so these men coude get no other answer. And this Alderman kept this yonge man styll in pryson tyll at the laste he there dyed. And so he causyd lykewyse dyuers other to dye in pryson and wolde neuer forgyue them / wherfore afterward this alderman dyed sodenly wherfore dyuers & many were glad of his deth. A northen man there was whiche wente to seke hym a seruyce. So it happenyd that he came to a lordys place whiche lord than had war wt another lord. This lord tha askyd this northe ma yf yt he durst fyght / ye by goddibyes qd ye northe ma yt I dare for I is al hart whervpon the lorde retayned hym in to his seruyce. So after it happenyd yt this lorde sholde go fyght with his enmyes wt whom also wet this northeman which shortly was smyte in ye hele wt an arow wherfore he incotynetly fell downe almost dede wherfore one of his felaws sayd art thou he yt art all hart and for so lytyll a stroke in the hele now art almost dede. To whom he answeryd & sayd by goddes sale I is hard hed / leggys / body helys & all / therfore ought not one to fere when he is stryken in ye hart. In a certayn towne there was a wyfe somwhat agyd that had beryed her husband whose name was callyd Iohn / whom she loued so tenderly in his lyfe that after his deth she causyd an ymage of tymber to be made in vysage and person as lyke to hym as coude be / whiche ymage all day longe lay vnder her bed and euery nyght she causyd her mayde to wrap it in a shete & lay it in her bed & callyd it olde Iohn. This wyfe also had a pretyse whose name was Iohn / which Iohn wolde fayn haue weddyd his maystres not for no grete pleasur but onely for her good bycause she was rych / wherfor he imaginyd how he might obtayn his purpose & spake to ye mayde of ye hous & desyryd her to lay hym in his maystres bed for one nyght in stede of the pycture / & promysed her a rewarde for her laboure / which mayd ouer nyght wrappyd ye sayd yog ma in a shete & layd hym in his maystres bed as she was wot to lay ye pycture. ¶This wydow was wont euery nyght before she slept & dyuers tymes whe she wakyd to kys the sayd pycture of old Iohn / wherfore ye sayd nyght she kyssyd ye sayd yong ma beleuyng that she had kyst ye pycture / & he sodely start & toke her in his armys and so well-plesed her then / that olde Iohn from thes forth was clene out of her mynde & was cotent yt this yonge Iohn sholde lye wt her styl all yt nyght & yt the pycture of olde Iohn sholde lye styl vnder ye bed for a thyng of nought. After this in ye mornynge this wydow intendyng to plese this yog Iohn which had made her so good pastyme all the nyght bad her mayd go dresse some good mete for theyr brekefast to fest therwith her yog Iohn / this mayd wha she had loge sought for wood to dres ye sayd mete told her mastres yt she coud fynd no wod yt was dry except onely ye picture of old Iohn yt lyeth vnder ye bed / the qd ye wyf agayn / fath hym down & lay hym on ye fyre for I se well he wyll neuer do me good nor he wyll neuer do better seruyce though I kepe hym neuer so longe. So the mayd by her comaundemet fet the pycture of old Iohn fro vnder ye bed & therwith made good fyre & dressid ye brekfast / & so olde Iohn was cast out for nought & brent & from thens forth yong Iohn occupyed his place. ¶By this tale ye may se it is no wysdome for a ma to kepe longe or to chyryshe that thyng yt is able to do no pleasure nor seruyce. ¶Finis.
