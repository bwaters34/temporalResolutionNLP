 byteth him, he can heare no bourde, he hath raysed vp a new sect of serius stoikes, that can abide naught but their owen shadowe, and alow nothing worthye, but what they conceaue. Did you neuer reade (my ouer wittie frend) that vnder the persons of beastes many abuses were dissiphered haue you not reason to waye? that whatsoeuer ether Virgil did write of his gnatt, or Ouid of his fley: was all couertly to declare abuse? but you are ( homo literatus ) a man of the letter little savouring of learning, your giddy brain made you leaue your thrift, and your abuses in London some part of your honestie. You say that Poets are subtil, if so, you haue learned that poynt of them, you can well glose on a trifleling text. but you haue dronke perhaps of Lethe , your gramer learning is out of your head, you forget your Accidence, you remeber not, that vnder the person of Æ neas in Virgil the practice of a dilligent captaine is discribed vnder ye shadow of byrds, beastes and trees, the follies of the world were disiphered, you know not, that the creation is signified in the Image these are toyes because they sauor of wisedome which you want. Marke what Campanus sayth, Mira fabularum.vanitas sed qu ae si introspiciantur videri possunt non vanoe . The vanitie of tales is wonderful, yet if we aduisedly looke into them they wil seme & proue wise. how wonderful are the pithie poemes of Cato? the curious comidies of Plautus? how brauely discouereth Terence our imperfectio in his Eunuch? how neatly dissiphereth he Danus? how pleasauntly paynteth he out Gnatho? whom if we should seeke in our dayes, I suppose he would not be farr from your parson. But I see you woulde seeme to be that which you are not, and as the prouerb sayth Nodum in Cirpo qu aerere: Poetes you say vse coullors to couer ther incouiences, and wittie sentences to burnish theyr bawdery, and you diuinite to couer your knauerye. But tell mee truth Gosson speakest thou as thou thinkest? what coelers findest thou in a Poete not to be admitted? are his speaches vnperfect? fanor they of inscience. I think if thou hast any shame thou canst not but like & approue the, are ther gods displesant vnto thee? doth Saturne in his maiesty moue thee? doth Iuno discomfort thee? doth Apollo with his harping harme thee? thou mayst say nothing les then harme thee because they are not, and I thinke so to because thou knowest them not. For wot thou that in the person of Saturne our decaying yeares are signified, in the picture of angry Iuno , our affections are dissiphered, in ye person of Minerua is our vnderstading signified, both in respect of warre, as policie. When they faine that Pallas was begotten of the braine of Iupiter their meaning is none other, but that al wisedome (as the learned say) is from aboue, and commeth from the father of Lights: in the portrature of Apollo all knowledge is denocated. so that, what so they wrot, it was to this purpose, in the way of pleasure to draw men to wisedome: for seing the world in those daies was vnperfect, yt was necessary that they like good Phistons: should so frame their potions, that they might be appliable to the quesie stomaks of their werish patients. but our studientes by your meanes haue made shipwrack of theyr labors, our schoolemaisters haue so offended that by your iudgement they shall subire poe nam capitis for teaching poetry, the vniuersitie is ille beholding to you, al their practices in teaching are friuolus. Witt hath wrought that in you, that yeares and studie neuer setled in the heads of our sagest doctors. No meruel though you disprayse poetry, when you know not what it meanes. Erasmus will make that the path waye to so knowledge which you disprayse, and no meane fathers vouchsafe in their seriouse questions of deuinitie, to inserte poeticall sensures. I think if we shal wel ouerloke ye Philosophers, we shal find their iudgemets not halfe perfect, Poetes you saye fayle in their fables, Philosophers in the verye secrets of Nature. Though Plato could wish the expulsion of Poetes from his well publiques, which he might doe with reason, yet the wisest had not all that same opinion, it had bene better for him to haue sercht more narowly what the soule was, for his diffinition was verye friuolus, when he would make it naught els but Substantiam intelectu predictam . If you say that Poetes did labour about nothing, tell me (I besech you) what wonders wroughte those your dunce Doctors in ther reasons de ente et non ente? in theyr definition of no force, and les witt? how sweete they power soules in makinge more things then cold be? that I may vse your owne phrase, did not they spende one candle by seeking another. Demoeritus, Epicurus , with ther scholler Metrodorus how labored they in finding out more worlds the one? your Plato in midst of his prestlines wrought that absurdite that never may be redd its Poets, to make a yearthly creature to beare the person of the creator, and a corruptible substaunce, an incomprehensible God: for determining of the principall causes of all thinges, a made them naughte els but an Idea which if it be conferred wyth the truth, his sentence. will fauour of Inscience. but I speake for Poetes, I ausweare your abuse, therefore I will disproue, or disprayse naught, but wish you with the wise Plato , to disprayse that thing you offend not in Seneca sayth that the studdie of Poets, is to make childre ready to the vnderstanding of wisedom, and ye our auncients did teache artes Eleurherias.i.liberals , because the instructed childre by the instrumet of knowledg in time became homines liberi.i. Philosophye . it may be that in reding of poetry, it happened to you as it is with the Oyster, for she in her swimming receiueth no ayre, and you in your reading lesse instruction it is reported that the shape of Enboia want ther gale, distentum fel. Men hope that scollers should haue witt brought vpp in the Uniuersite, but your sweet selfe with the cattell of Enboia , since you left your College haue lost your learning, you disprayse Maximinns. Tirius pollicey, and that thinge that that he wrott to manifest learned Poets mening, you attribute to follye. O holy hedded man, why may not Iuno pollice? will you haue all for you owne tothe? must men write that you maye know theyr meaning? as though your wytt were to wrest all things? Alas simple Irus , begg at knowledge gate awhile, thou haste not wonne the mastery of learning. weane thy selfe to wisedome, and vse thy tallant in zeale not for enuie, abuse not thy knowledge in dispraysing that which is pereles: I shold blush from a player, to become an enuiouse preacher, if thou hadst zeale to preach, if for Sions sake thou coldst not holde thy tongue, thy true dealing were prayse worthy, thy reuolting woulde counsell me to reuerence thee pittie weare it, that poetrye should be displaced, full little could we want Bachannans workes, and Boetius comfortes may did he indeuour by painting them out of Greeke into Latine to manifest sinne vnto vs? or to confirme vs in goodues? Labor (I pray thee) in Pamphelets more prayse worthy, thou haste not saued a Senator, therefore not worthye a Lawrell wreth, thou hast not (in disprouing poetry) reproued all abuse, and therfore not worthy commendation. Seneca sayth that Magna vit ae pars elabitur male agentibus, maxima nihill agentibus, tota alind agentibus , the most of our life (sayd he)is spent ether in doing euill, or nothing, or that wee should not, and I would wish you weare exempted from this sensure, geue eare but a little more what may be said for poetrie, for I must be briefe, you haue made so greate matter that I may not stay on one thing to long, lest I leaue an other vntouched. And first whereas you say, ye Tullie in his yeres of more iudgement despised Poetes, harke (I pray you) what he worketh for them in his oratio pro Archia poeta (but before you heare him least you fayle in the incounter, I would wysh you to to followe the aduise of the dasterdlye I chneumon of Æ gipt , who when shee beholdeth the Aspis her enemye to drawe nighe, calleth her fellowes together, bismering her selfe with claye, against the byting and stroke of the serpent, arme your selfe, cal your witts together: want not your wepons, lest your inperfect iudgement be rewardede with Midas eares, you had neede play the night burd now, for you day Owl hath misconned his parte, and for to who now a dayes he cryes foole you: which hath brought such a sort of wondering birds about your eares, as I feare me will chatter you out of your. Iuey bush, the worlde shames to see you, or els you are afrayde to shew your selfe, you thought poetrye should want a patron (I think) when you fyrste published this inuectiue, but yet you synd al to many eue preter expectatione , yea though it can speake for it self, yet her patron Tullie now shall tell her tale, H aec studia (sayth he) adolescentiam alunt, Senectutem oblectant, secnndas, res ornant, aduersis perfuglum ac Solatium prebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregriantur, rusticantur: then will you disprayse ye which all men commend? you looke ouly by on ye refuse of ye abuse, nether respecting the importance of ye matter nor the weight of ye wryter. Solon vncontrold, & though he be lauish in the letter, his sense is serious, who in Rome lameted not Roscius death & cast thou suck no plesure out of thy M. Claudians writings? hark, what Cellarius a learned father attributeth to it acuit memoriam (saith he) it profiteth ye memory yea ( & Tully attributeth it for prais to Archias ye vpon any theame he cold versify exlepory, who liketh not of the promptues of Ouid? who not vnworthely cold bost of himself thus Quicquid conabar dicere versus erat . who then doothe not wonder at poetry? who thinketh not ye it procedeth fro aboue? what made ye Chians & Colophonians fal to such controuersy? Why seke ye Smirnians , to recouer fro ye Salamini ans the prais of Homer? al wold hane him to be of ther city, I hope not for harme, but because of his knoledge. Themistocles , desireth to be acquainted wt those wt could best descipher his praises euen Morius himselfe, tho neuer so cruel, accopted of Plotinus poems. what made Aphricanus estemed Pompie so muche of Theophanes Mitilatus or Brutus so greatly the wrytinges of Accius? Fuluius was so great a fauorer of poetry, that after the Aetolian warres, he attributed to the Muses those spoiles that belonged to Mars , in all the Romaine conquest, hardest thou euer of a slayne Poete? nay rather the Emperours honored them, beautified them with benefites, & decked their sanctuaries which sacrifice, Pindarus colledg is not fit for spoil of Alexander ouercome, nether feareth poetry yt persecutors sword, what made Austin so much affectate ye heauenly fury? not folly, for if I must needes speake, illnd non ausim affirmare , his zeale was, in setting vp of the house of God, not in affectate eloquence, he wrot not, he accompted not, he honnored not, so much that (famous poetry) whyche we prayse, without cause, for if it be true that Horace reporteth in his booke de arte poetica , all the answeares of the Oracles weare in verse, among the precise Iewes, you shall find Poetes, and for more maiestie Sibilla will prophesie in verse Hiroaldus can witnes with me, that Dauid was a poet, and that his vayne was in imitating (as S. Ierom witnesseth) Horace, Flaccus , anone he hath recourse to a Saphier vaine, and aliquando, semipede ingreditur. vouchsafed poetical practises, for (if Origen and he fault) not theyre verse was Hexameter, and pentameter . Enquire of Cassiodorus , he will say that all the beginning of Poetrye proceeded from the Scripture, Panlinus tho the byshop of Nolanum yet vouchsafe the name of a Poet, and Ambrose tho he be a patriarke in mediolana loueth versifing Beda shameth not ye science that shamelesse Gosson misliketh. reade ouer Lactantius , his proofe is by poetry. & Paul voutsafeth to ouerlooke Epimenides let the Apostle preach at Athens he disdaineth not of Aratus authorite, it is a pretye sentence yet not so prety as pithy. Poeta na scitur orator fit as who should say, Poetrye commeth from aboue from a heauenly seate of a glorious God vnto an excellent creature man, an orator is but made by exercise, for if wee examine well what befell Ennius amonge the Romans, and Hesiodus among his contrimen the Gretians, howe they came by theyr knowledge whence they receued their heauenly furye, the first will tell vs that sleping vpon the Mount of Parnassus which he became a Poete, the next will assure you that it commeth not by labor, nether that night watchings bringeth it, but ye we must haue it thence whence he fetched it wt was (he saith) fro a wel of ye Muses wt Cabelimus calleth Poru , a draught whereof drewe him to his perfection, so of a shephard he becam an eloquet poet, wel the you see ye it commeth not vp exercise of play making, nether insertio of gawds, but from nature, and from aboue: and I hope ye Aristotle hath sufficiently taught you: that Natura nihil fecit frustra. Perseus . was made & poete diuino furore percitus . and whereas the poets were sayde to call for the Muses helpe ther mening was no other as Iodocus Badius reporteth, but to call for heauenly inspiration from aboue, to direct theyr endedeuors. nether were it good for you to sette light by the name of a poet since ye oft pring from whence he cometh is so heauenly, Sibil la in hir answers to Æ neas against hir will as the poet telleth vs was possessed wt thys fury, ye wey consideratly but of the writing of poets, & you shall se that whe ther matter is most heauenly, their stile is most loftye a strange token of the wonderful efficacy of the same. I would make a long discourse in to you of Platoes 4\. furies but I leue them it pitieth me to bring a rodd of your owne making to beate you wythal. But mithinks while you heare thys. I see you swallowe down your owne spittle for reuenge, where (God not) my wryting sauoreth not of enuye. in this case I coulde wyshe you fare farre otherwyse from your foe yf you please I wyll became your frende and see what a potion or receypt I can frame fytt for your diet and herein I will proue my selfe a practiser, before I purdge you, you shall take a preparatiue to dis burden your heauy hedde of those grose follis you haue conceued but the receipt is bitter, therfore I would wysh you first tasten your mouth with the Singer of perseuerace for ther is a cold collop ye must downe your throate yet suche a one as shall chasige your complection quit. I wyll haue you therfore to tast first of ye cold riuer Phricus , white, or of Scamandar, which maketh gray yalow ye is of an enuious ma a wel minded person, reprehending of zeale ye wherin he hath sinned by folly, & so being prepard, thy purgation wyll worke more easy, thy understandinge wyll be more perfit, thou shalt blush at thy abuse, and reclaime thy selfe by force of argument to will thou proue of clene recouered patient, and I a perfecte practiser in framing so good a potion. This broughte to passe I with the wil secke out some abuse in poetry, which I wil seeke for to disproue by reason first pronounced by no smal birde euen Aristotle himself Poet ae putteth in his centure. Admiranda canunt sed non credenda poet ae . these were sore blemishes if obiected rightly and heare you may say the streme runues a wronge, but if it be so by you leue I wyll bring him shortly in his right chanel. My answere shall not be my owne, but a learned father shall tell my tale, if you will know his name men call him Lactantius: who in hys booke de diuinis institutionibus reesoneth thus. I suppose (sayth he) Poets are full of credit, and yet it is requesite for those that wil vnderstand them to be admonished, that among them, not onely the name but the matter beareth a show oft that it is not: for if sayth he we examine the Scriptures litter allye nothing will seeme more falls, and if we way Poetes wordes and not ther meaning, our learning in them wilbe very mene you see nowe that your Catoes iudgement of no force and that all your obiections you make agaynst poetrye be of no valor yet lest you should be altogether discoraged I wyll helpe you forwarde a little more, it pities me to consider the weaknes of your cause I wyll therfore make your strongest reason, more strong and after I haue builded it vp destroy it agayn. Poets you confesse are eloquent but you reproue them in their wantonnesse, they write of no wisedom, you may say their tales are friuolus, they prophane holy thinges, they seeke nothing to the perfection of our soules, theyr practise is in other things, of lesse force: to this obiection I answer no otherwise then Horace doeth in his booke de arte poetica where he wryteth thus, Siluestres homines sacer interpresque deorum Sedibus, et victu s aedo deterruit orpheus. Dictus ob hoc lenire Tigres rabidosque leones. Dictus et Amphion Thebanae condit vrbis Saxa mouere sono, testudius et prece blanda Ducere quo vellet fuit hoc sapientia quondam. Publica priuatis secernere sacra prophanis. Concubitu prohibere vago, dare Iura maritis, O pida moliri leges, niscidere ligno. The holy spokesman of the Gods With heauely Orpheus hight: Did driue the sauage men from wods, And made them liue aright. And therefore is sayd the Tygers fierce, And Lyons full of myght To ouercome: Amphion , he Was layd of Theabs the founder, Who by his force of Lute dyd cause, The stones to part a sonder. And by his speach them did derect. Where he would haue them staye: This wisedome this was it of olde All strife for to allay. To giue to euery man his owne, To make the Gods be knowne To driue each lecher from the bed, That neuer was his owne. To teach the law of mariage, The way to build a towne, For to engraue these lawes in woods This was these mens renowne. I cannot leaue Tirtheus pollicy vntouched, who by force of his pen could incite men to the defence of theyr countrye. if you require of ye Oracle of Apollo what successe you shal haue: respondet bellicoso numino lo now you see your obiections my answers, you behold or may perceiue manifestlye, that Poetes were the first vaysors of cities, prescribers of good lawes, mayntayners of religion, disturbors of the wicked, aduancers of the wel disposed, inuetors of laws, & lastly the very fot paths to knowledg. & vnderstading ye if we shold beleue Herome he wil make Platos exiles honest me, & his pestiferous poets good preachers: for he accounteth Orpheus Museus , & Linus, Christians , lernedly describeth ye iourny of Æ neas to Elisum ) asserteneth vs, ye among them ye were ther for the zeale they beare toward there country, ther wer found Quinque py vates et Ph aebo digna loquti but I must answer al objectios, I must fil euery nooke. I must arme my self now, for here is the greatest bob I can gather out of your booke forsoth Ouids abuses, in descrybing whereof you labour very vehementlye termig him letcher, & in his person disprarise all poems, but shall on mans follye destroye a vniuersal comodity? what gift what perfit knowledg hath ther bin. emong ye professors of wt ther hath not bin a bad, on the Angels haue shined in heaue, Ada & Eur in earthly paradise, emog ye holy apostles vngratious Iudas. I reson not ye al poets are holy but I affirme ye poetry is a heauely gift a perfit gift then wt I know not greater plesure. & surely if I may speak my mind I thik we shal find but few poets if it were exactly wayd what they oughte to be your Muscouian straungers, your Scithian monsters wonderful by one Eurus brought vpon one stage in ships made of Sheepeskins, wyll not proue you a poet nether your life alow you to bee of that learning if you had wisely wayed & abuse of poetry if you had reprehended ye foolish fantasies of our poets no mine non re which they bring forth on stage, my self wold haue liked of you ye allowed your labor. but I perceiue nowe ye all red colloured stones are not Rubies, nether is euery one Alexander ye hath a state in his cheke, al lame men are not Vulcans , nor hooke nosed men. Ciceroes nether each professer a poet, I abhore those poets that sauor of ribaldry, I will with the zealous admit the expullcion of suche enormities poetry is dispraised not for the folly that is in it, but for the abuse whiche manye ill Wryters couller by it & Beleeue mee the magestrats may take aduise, (as I knowe wisely can) to roote out those odde rymes which runnes in euery rascales mouth. Sauoring of rybaldry, those foolishe ballets, that are admitted, Make poets good and godly practises to be refused. I like not of a wicked Nero that wyll expell Lucin yet , y admit I of a zealous gouernour that wil seke to take away the abuse of poetry. I like not of an angrye Augustus which wyll banishe Ouid for enuy, I loue a wise Senator, which in wisedome wyll correct him and with aduise burne his follyes: vnhappy were we yf like poore Scaurus we shoulde find Tiberius that wyll put vs to death for a tragedy making but most blessed were we, if we might find a iudge that seuerely would amende the abuses of Tragedies, but I leaue the reformation thereof to more wyser than my selfe, And retourne to Gosson whom I wyshe to be fully perswaded in this cause, and therefore I will tell hym a prety story, which Iustin wryteth in the prayse of poetrye. The Lacedemonians when they had loste many men in diuers incountryes with theyr enemyes soughte to the Oracles of Apollo requiring how they myght recouer theyr losses, it was answered that they mighte ouercome if so be that they could get an Athenian gouernor, whereupon theyr sent Orators vnto the Athenians humbly requesting them that theyr woulde appoynt them out one of theyr best captaynes: the Athenians owinge them old malice, sent them in steede of a boldada vechio a scholar of the Muses in steede silly Tirthetus , a man of great eloquence and singuler wytte, yet was he but a lame lymde captaine more fit for the coche then the field, the Lacedemonians trusting the Oracle, receued the champion, and fearing the gouernment of a stranger, made him ther Citizen, which once don and he obteining the Dukdome, he assended the theater, and ther very learnedly, wyshing them to forget theyr folly, and to thinke on victory they being acuate by his eloquece waging battail won the fielde. Lo now you see that the framing of common welthes, & defenee therof, proceedeth from poets, how dare you therefore open your mouth against them? how can you disprayse the preseruer of a countrye? you compare Homer to Methecus , cookes to Poetes, you shame your selfe in your vnreuerent similituds, you may see your follyes verbum sapienti sat . where as Homer was an ancient poet, you disalow him, and accompte of those of lesser iudgement. Strabo calleth poetry, primam sapientiam. Cicero in his firste of hys Cusculans attributeth ye inuencion of philosophy, to poets. God keepe vs from a Plato: that should expet such men pittie were it that the memory of these valiant victours should be hidden, which haue dyed in the behalfe of ther countryes; miserable were out state yf we wanted those worthy volumes of poetry could the learned beare the losse of Homer? or our younglings the wrytings of Mantuan? or you your volumes of historyes? beleue me yf you had wanted your Mysteries of nature, & your stately storyes, your booke would haue scarce bene ledde wyth matter, if therefore you will deale in things of wisedome, correct the abuse, honor the science, renewe your schoole, crye out ouer Hierusalem wyth the prophet, the woe that he pronounced, wish the teacher to reforme hys lyse, that his weake scholler may proue the wyser, cry out against vnfaciable desyre in rich men, tel the house of Iacob they iniquilities, lament with the Apostle the want of laborers in the Lords vineyards, cry out on those dume doggs that will not barke, wylt the mightye that they ouermayster not the poore, and put downe the beggers prowde heart by thy perswasions. Thunder oute wyth the Prophete Micba the mesage of the LORD, and wyth hym desyre the Iudges to heare thee, the Prynces of Iacob to hearken to thee, and those of the house of Israell to vnderstande then tell them that they abhore iudgement, and preuent equitie, that they iudge for rewardes, and that theyr priests teach for hyse, and the prophets thereof prophesie for money, and yet that they saye the Lorde is wyth them, and that no euil can befall them, breath out the sweete promises to the good, the cursses to the badde, tell them that a peeace muste needes haue a warre, and that God can rayse vp another Zenacharib, shew the that Salamons kingdome was but for a season and that adueritse cometh ere we espye it. these be the songes of Sion, these be those rebukes which you oughte to add to abuses recouer the body, for it is sore, the appedices thereof will easely be reformed, if that wear at a staye, but other matter call me and I must not staye vpon this onely, there is an easier task in hand for me, and that which if I may speak my conscience, fitteth my vain best, your second abuse Gosson, your second abuse your disprayses of Musik, which you vnaduisedly terme pyping: that is it wyll most byte you, what so is a ouerstay of life, is displesant to your person, musik may not stand in your presence, whereas all the learned philosophers haue alwayes had it in Gods whiche Gosson accompteth folishnesse, looke vppon the harmonie of the Heanens? hange they not by Musike? doe not the Spheares moue? the primus motor gouerne. be not they inferior a corpora affected quadam sumpathi ae and agreement? howe can we measure the debilitie of the patient but by the disordered motion of the pulse? is not man worse accompted of when he is most out of tune? is there any thinge that more affecteth the sense? doth there any pleasure more acuat our vnderstanding can the wonders ye hath wroughte and which you your selfe confesse no more moue you? it fitteth well nowe that the learned haue sayd, musica requirit generosum animu which since it is far from you, no maruel though you fauor not that profession. it is reported of the Camelion that shee can chaunge her selfe vnto all coollors saue whyte, and you can accompte of all thinges saue such as haue honesty. Plutarch your good Mayster may bare the witnes, that the ende whereto Musick was, will prooue it prayrs worthy, O Lorde howe maketh it a man to remember heauenly things. to woder at the works of the creator, Eloquence can stay the souldiars sworde from slayinge an Orator, and shall not musike be magnified which not onely saueth the bodye but is a comfort to the soule? Dauid reioseth singeth and prayseth the Lorde by the Harpe, the Simbale is not remoued from his same wary, the Aungels syng gloria in excelsis. Surely the imagination in this present instant, calleth me to a deepe consideration of my God. looke for wonders where musike worketh, and wher harmonie is ther foloweth increcible delectation. the bowels of the earth yeld. where the instrument soundeth and Pluto cannot keepe Proserpina if Orpheus recorde. The Seas shall not swallowe Arion whilst he singeth, nether shall hee perish while he harpeth, a doleful tuner yf a diing musition can moue a Monster of ye sea. to mourne. a Dolphin respectet a heauenlye recorde. call your selfe home therefore and reclayme thys follye, it is to foule to bee admitted, you may not mayntaiue it. I hadd well hoped you woulde in all these thynges haue wiselye admytted the thyng, and disalowe naughte but the abuse, but I see your mynde in your wryting was to penn somewaht you knowe not what, and to confyrme it I wot not howe, so that your selfe hath hatched vs an Egge yet to that it hath blest vs wyth a monsterus chickin, both wythoute hedde, and also tayle, lyke the Father, full of imperfection and lesse zeale, well marke yet a lyttle more, beare with me though I be bytter, my loue is neuer the lesse for that I haue learned of Tullye , that Nulla remedia tam faciunt dolorem quam qu ae sunt salutaria , the sharper medycine the better it cures, the more you see your follye, the sooner may you amende it. Are not the straines in Musike to tickle and delyght the eare? are not our warlike instruments to moue men to valor? You confesse they mooue vs, but yet they delight not our eares, I pray you whence grew that poynt of Phylosophy? it is more then euer my Mayster taught mee, that a thynge of sounde shoulde not delyghte the eare, belyke yee suppose that men are monsters, withoute eares, or else I thynke you wyll saye they heare with theire heeles, it may bee so, for indeede when wee are are delighted with Musike, it maketh our heart to scypy for ioye, and it maye bee perhaps by assending from the heele to the hygher partes, it may move vs, good policy in sooth, this was of your owne coyning your mother neuer taught it you, but I wyll not deale by reason of philosophye wyth you for that confound your senses, but I can asure you this one thinge, that this principle will make the wiser to mislike your inuention, it had bene a filter iest for your howlet in your playe, then an ornamet in your booke, but since you wrote of abuses we may licence you to lye a little, so ye abuse will be more manifest lord. with how goodly a cote haue you clothed your conceiptes, you abound in storyes but impertinent, they bewray your reeding but not your wisedom would God they had bin well aplyed. But now I must play the musitian right nolesse buggs now come in place but pauions and mesures, dumps & fancies & here growes a great question, what musick Homer vsed in curing ye diseased gretians, it was no dump you say, ye so think I, for & is not apliable to sick men, for it fauoreth Malancholie. I am sure, it was no mesure, for in those days they were not such good dasers for soth the what was it? if you require me if you name me the instrumet, I wyl tel you what was ye musik, mean while a gods name let vs both dout, ye it is no part of our saluation to know what it answere. But you can not be content to erre but you must maintain it to. Pithagoras you say allowes not that musik is decerned by eares, but hee wisheth vs to assend vnto the sky & marke that harmony. surely thys is but one doctors opinions (yet I dislike not of it) but to speake my conscience my thinkes musike best pleaseth me when I heare it, for otherwise the catter walling of Cats, were it not for harmonies should more delight mine eies then the tunable voyces of men. but these things are not the chiefest poynts you shote at, thers somewhat els sticketh in your stomak God graunt it hurt you not, from the daunce you runn to the pype, from 7. to 3. which if I shoulde add I beleeue I coulde wrest out halfe a score incoueniences more out of your booke our pleasant consortes do discomfort you much, and becasue you lyke not thereof, they arr discomendable, I haue heard it is good to take sure sotinge when we trauel vnknowen countryes, for when we wade aboue our shoe latchet Appeles wyll resprehende vs for coblers, if you had bene a father in musick and coulde haue descruid of tunes I would perhaps haue like your opinion sumwhat where now I abhor it, if you wear a professor of that practice I would quickly perswade you, that the adding of strings to our instrument make the sound more hermonious, and that the mixture of Musike maketh a better concent, but to preach to vnskillfull is to perswad ye brut beastes, I wyl not stand long in thys point although the dignitys thereof require a volume, but howe learned men haue esteemed this heauenly gift, if you please to read you shall see. Socrates in hys old age will not disdain to learn ye science of Musik amog children, he can abide their correctios to; so much accoused he that, wt you contemn, so profitable thought he ye, wt you misleik, Solon wil esteme to much of ye knowledg of singing, yehe wil soner forget to dye the to sing. Pithagoras liks it so wel ye he wil place it in Greace . and Aristoxinus will saye & the soule is musik Plato (in his booke de legibus ) will affirme that it can not be handled without all sciences, the Lacedemonians & Creasis wer sturred to ware by Anapestus foote, and Timotheus with the same incensed kinge Alexander to batel, ye yf Boetyus sitten not an Tautomictanus (thy this Phrigian sound hasten did vain aluse wher a strsipet was hidden so little abideth this heauey harmony our humane filthines, ye it worketh wonders as you may perceue most manifestly by the history of Agamemnon who going to ye Troian war, left at home a musitian ye playde the Dorian tune, who wt the foote Spondeus preserued his wife Clitemnestra in chastity & honesty, wherfore she cold not bee desflowred by Æ gistus , before he had wickedly slain the musician, so ye as the magnetes draweth Iorne, & the Theamides (wt groweth in Æ gipt ) driueth it away: so musik calleth of it selfe al honest plesures, & dispelleth fro it all vaine misdemanors ye matter is so pletiful that I cannot find wher to end, as for beginnings they be infiuite, but these shall suffice. I like not to long circustances wher les doe serue. only I wish you to accompt wel of this heauely concent, wt is ful of perfectio, proceding fro aboue, drawing his original fro the motion of ye stars, fro the agrement of the planets, fro the whisteling winds & fro al those celestial circles, where is ether perfit agreemet or any Sumphonia , but as I like musik so admit I not of thos that depraue the same your pipers are as odius to mee as your selfe, nether alowe I your harpinge merye beggers: although I knewe you my selfe a professed play maker, & a paltry actor, since which ye windmill of your wit hath but tornd so long wyth the wynde of folly, that I fear me we shall see the dogg returne to his vomit, and the clensed sow to her myre, and the reformed scholemayster to hys old teaching of follye. beware it be not so, let not your booke be a blemish to your own profession. Correct not musik therefore whe it is praies worthy, least your worthlesse misliking bewray your madnes. way the abuse and that is matter sufficient to serue a magistrates animaduersion. heere may you aduise well, and if you haue any stale rethorik florish vpon thys text, the abuse is, when that is a pplyed to wantonnesse, which was created to shewe Gods worthinesse. When ye shamefull resorts of shameles curtezanes in sinful sonnets, shall prophane vertue these are no light sinnes, these make many goodmen lament,this causeth parents hate there right borne children, if this mere reformed by your policie I should esteme of you as you wysh. I feare me it fareth far otherwyse, latet anguis in herba , vnder your fare show of conscience take heede you cloake not your abuse, it were pitie the learned should be ouerseene in your simplenesse, I feare me you will be politick wyth Machauel not zealous as a prophet. Well I will not stay long vpon the abuse, for that I see it is to manifest, the remembraunce thereof is discommendable among the godly, and I my self am very loth to bring it in memory, to the wise aduised reader these mai suffice, to flee the Crocodel before hee commeth, lest we be bitten, and to auoyde the abuse of musik, since we se it, lest our misery be more When we fall into folly. Ictus piscator sapit , you heare open confession, these abuses are disclaimed by our Gosson, he is sory that hee hath so leudlye liued, & spent the oyle of his perfection in vnsauery Lampes he hath Argus eyes to watch him now, I wold wish him beware of his Islington, and such lyke resorts, if now he retourne from his repented lyse to his old folly, Lord how foule will be his fall. men know more then they speak if they be wise, I feare me some will blushe that readeth this, if he be bitten, wold God Gosson, at that instant might haue a watchman but I see it mere needelesse, perhaps he hath Os durum , and then what auayleth their presence. Well, I leaue this poynt til I know further of your mynde, mean while I must talke a little wyth you about ye thyrd abuse, for the cater cosens of pypers, theyr names (as you terme them) be players, & I thinke as you doe, for your experience is sufficient to enforme me but here I must loke about me, quacunque te tigeris vlousest , here is a talk that requireth a long treatis, and what my opinion is of players ye now shall plainly perceue. I must now serch my wits, I see this shall passe throughe many seuere sensors handling, I must aduise me what I write, and write that I would wysh, I way wel the seriousnes of the cause, and regarde verymuch the Iudges of my endeuor, whom if I could I would perswade, that I woulde not nourish abuse, nether mayntaine that which should be an vniuersall discomoditye. I hope they wil not iudge before they read, nether condemne without occasion The wisest wil alwais carry to eares, in ye they are to diserne two indifferent causes. I meane not to hold you in suspec, (seuere Iudges) if you gredely expect my verdit brefely this it is. Demostines thoughte not that Phillip shoulde ouercome when he reproued hym, neither feared Cicero Anthonies force, when in the Senate hee rebuked hym. To the ignorant ech thinge that is vnknowne semes vnprofitable, but a wise man can foresee and prayse by proofe, Pythagoras in womens eyes two kind of teares, the one of grefe the other to disceit: & those of iudgement can from the same flower suck honey with the bee, from whence the Spyder (I mean the ignorant) take their poison men ye haue knowledge what comedies & tragedis be, wil comend the, but it is sufferable in the folish to reproue that they know not, becaus ther mouthes wil hardly be stopped, Firste therfore if it be not tedious to Gosson to harken to the lerned, the reder shal perceiue the antiquity of playmaking, the inuentors of comedies, and therewithall the vse & comoditye of the So that in ye end I hope my labor shall be liked, and the learned wil soner conceue his folly, For tragedies & comedies Donate the gramarian sayth, they wer inuented by lerned fathers of the old time to no other purpose, but to yeelde prayse vnto God for a happy haruest, or plentifull yeere.and that thys is trewe the name of Tragedye doeth importe, for if you consider whence it came, you shall perceiue (as Iodocus Badius reporteth) that it drewe his original of Tragos, Hircus , & Ode, Cantus , (so called) for that the actors thereof had in rewarde for they labour, a Gotes skynne fylled wyth wyne. You see then that the fyrste matter of Tragedies was to giue thankes and prayses to GOD, and a gratefull prayer of the countrymen for a happye haruest, and this I hope was not discommendable. I knowe you will iudge is farthest from abuse. But to wade farther, thys fourme of inuention being found out, as the dayes wherein it was vsed did decay, and the world grew to more perfection, so ye witt of the younger sorte became more riper, for they leauing this fourme, inuented an other, in the which they altered the nature but not ye name: or for sonnets in prayse of ye gods, they did set forth the sower fortune of many exiles, the miserable fal of haples princes, The reuinous decay of many coutryes, yet not content with this, they presented the liues of Satyers , So that they might wiselye vnder the abuse of that name, discouer the follies of many theyr folish fellow citesens. and those monsters were then,as our parasites are now adayes: suche, as with pleasure reprehended abuse. as for commedies because they bear a more plesanter vain, I wil leaue the other to speake of them. Tully defines them thus. Comedia (saith he) is Imitatie vit ae, speculum consuctudinis, & imago veritatis , and it is sayde to be termed of Comai , for that they were exercised in the fielde they had they beginning wyth tragedies, but their matter was more plessaunt, for they were suche as did reprehend, yet quodam lepore . These first very rudly were inuented by Susarion Bullus ,  & Magnes, to auncient poets, yet so, that they were meruelous profitable to the reclamynge of abuse: whereupon Eupolis eloquenter vaine and perfection of stil, dyd more seuerely speak agaynst the abuses the they: which Horace himselfe witnesseth. For sayth he ther was no abuse but these men reprehended it. a thefe was loth to be seene one there spectacle. a coward was neuer present at theyr assemblies. a backbitor abhord that company. and I my selfe could not hane blamed your (Gosson) for exempting your selfe from this theater, of troth I shoulde haue lyke your pollicy. These therefore, these wer they that kept men in awe, these restrayned the vnbridled cominaltie, whervpon Horace wisely sayeth. Oderunt paceare boni, virtul is ambre. Oderuns peccarea mali, formidinepen ae. the wicked bee poynted out from the good, a harlot woulde seeke no harbor at stage plais, lest she shold here her owne name growe in questin: and the discourse of her honesty cause her to bee hated of the godly. as for you I am sure of this one thing, he would paint you in your players ornamets, for they best becam you. But as these sharpe corrections were disanulde in Rome when they grewe to more licenciousnes: So I fear me if we shold practise it in our dayes, the same intertainmente would followe. But in ill reformed Rome what comedies now? a poets wit can correct, yet not offend. Philemon will mitigate the corrections of sinne, by reprouing them couertly in shadowes. Menandar dare not offend ye Senate openly, yet wants he not a parasite to touch them priuely. Terence wyl not report the abuse of the harlots vnder there proper stile, but he can finely girde the vnder the person of Thais . hee dare not openly tell the Rich of theyr couetousnesse and seuerity towards their children, but he can controle noble young gentilmen vnder theyr owne title, but he wyll warne them in the person of Pamphilus . wil you learne to know a parasite? Looke vpon his Dauus . wyl you seke the abuse of courtly flatteres? hehold Gnato and if we had some Satericall Poetes nowe a dayes to penn our commedies, that might be admitted of zeale, to discypher the abuses of the worlde in the person of notorious offenders, I know we should wisely ryd our assemblyes of many of your brotherhood, but because you may haue a full scope to reprehende, I will [illeg.] vp a rablemet of playmakers, whose wrightinges I would wishe you overlooke, and seeke out theyr abuses. can you mislike of Cecillius? or dispise Plinius? or amend Neuius? or find fault with Licinius? where in offended Actilius? I am sure you can not but wonder at Ferrenco? wil it please you to like of Turpelius? or alow of Trabea? you muste needs make much of Ennius for ouerloke althes, & you shal find ther volums ful of wit if you examin the: so ye if you had no other masters, you might deserue to be a doctor, wher now you are but a folishe scholemaister, but I wyll deale wyth you verey freendlye, I wil resolue eueri doubt that you find, those instruments which you mislike in playes grow of auncient custome, for when Rossius was an Actor, be sure that as with his tears he moued affections, so the Musitian in the Theater before the entrance, did mornefully record it in melody (as Seruius reporteth.) Theaetors in Rome had also gay clothing euery mas aparel was apliable to his part & person. The old men in white, ye rich men in purple, the parasite disguisedly, the yong men in gorgeous coulours, ther wanted no deuise nor good iudgemet of ye comedy, whe I suppose our players, both drew ther plaies & fourme of garments, as for the appointed dayes wherin comedies wer showen, I reede that the Romaynes appoynted them on the festiual dayes, in such reputation were they had at that time. Also Iodocus Badius will assertain you that the actors for shewing pleasure receued some profite. but let me apply those dayes to ours, their actors to our players, their autors to ours. surely we want not a Rossius , nether ar ther great scarcity of Terrences professio, but yet cur then dare not nowe a dayes presume so much, as the old Poets might. and therefore they apply ther writing to the peoples vain whereas, if in the beginning they had ruled, we should now adaies haue found final spectacles of folly. but (of truth) I must confes with Aristotle , that men are greatly delighted with imitation, and that it were good to bring those things on stage, that were altogether tending to vertue: all this I admit, & hartely wysh, but you say vnlesse the thinge be taken away the vice will continue, nay I say if the style were changed the practise would profit, and sure I thinke our theaters fit, that Ennius seeing our loaton Glicerium may rebuke her, if our poetes will nowe become seuere, and for prophaue things write of vertue: you I hope shoulde see a reformed state in those thinges, which I feare me yf they were not, the idle hedded commones would worke more mischiefe, I wish as zealously as the best that all abuse of playinge weare abolished, but for the thing, the antiquitie causeth me to allow it, so it be vsed as it should be. I cannot allow the prophaning of the Sabaoth, I praise your reprehension in that, you did well in discommenting the abuse, and surely I wysh that that folly wee disclaymed, it is not to be admitted, it maks those stune, whiche perhaps if it were not, would haue binne present at a good sermon it is in the Magistrate to take away that order, and appoynt it otherwyse. but sure it were pittie to abolish ye which hath so great vertue in it. because it is abused. The Germanes when the vse of preaching was forbidden them, what helpe had they I pray you? for soth the learned were fayne couertly in comodies to declare abuses, and by playing to incite the people to vertues, whe they might heare no preaching. Those were lamentable dayes you will say, and so thinke I, but was not this I pray you a good help in reforming the decaying Gospel? you see then how comedies (my seuere iudges) are requesit both for ther antiquity, and for ther commoditye. for the dignity of the wrighters, and the pleasure of the hearers. But after your discrediting of playmaking, you salue vppon the sore somewhat, and among many wise workes there be some that fitte your vaine: the practise of parasites is one, which I meruel it likes you so well since it bites you so sore. but sure in that I like your iudgement, and for the rest to, I approue your wit, but for the pigg of your own sow, (as you terme it) assuredly I must discommend your verdit, tell me Gosson was all your owne you wrote there: did you borow alienam olet lucern a non tuam . so that your helper may wisely reply vpon you with Virgil. Hos ego versiculos feci tulit alter honores, I made these verses other bear the name. beleue me I should preferr Wilsons. shorte and sweete if I were iudge, a peece surely worthy prayse, the practise of a good scholler, would the wiser would ouerlooke that, they may perhaps cull some wisedome, out of a players toye. Well, as it is wisedome to commend where the cause requireth, so it is a poynt of folly to praise without deserte. you dislike players very much, theyr dealings be not for your commodity, whom if I myghte aduise they should learne thys of Iuuenal, , Viuendum est recte, Methinks I heare some of them verifiing these verses vpon you, if it be so that I hear them, I wil concele it, as for the statute of apparrell and the abuses therof, I see it manifestly broken. and if I should seeke for example, you cannot but offend my eyes. For if you examine the statuts exactly, a simple cote should be fitted to your backe. we shold bereue you of your brauerye, and examine your aucestry, & by profession in respect of ye statute, we should find you catercosens with a, (but hush) you know my meaning, I must for pitie fauor your credit in that you weare once a scholler. you runne farther to Carders, dicers, fencers, bowlers, daunsers, & tomblers. whose abuses I wold rebuke with you, had not your self moued other matters. but to eche I say thus, for dicing I wyshe those that know it not to leaue to learn it, & let the fall of others make them wiser. Yf with them not to a huse the leuitie of their prince. Cicero for a great blemish reputeth that which our gentilmen vse for brauery, but sufficit ista leuiter attigisse , a word against fencers, & so an end. whom I wish to beware with Demonax left admitting theyr fencing delightes, they destroy (with the Athenians ) the alters of peace, by raysing quarrellous causes, they worke vprores: but you and I reproue the in abuse, yet I (for my part) cannot but allow the practise so it be well vsed, as for the filling of our gracious princes cofers with peace, as it pertaineth not to me, because I am none of her receiuors, so men think vnlesse it hath bine lately you haue not bene of her maiesties counsel. But now here as you begin folishly, so surely you end vnlernedly. prefer you warre before peace? the sword before the Goune? the rule of a Tyrant, before ye happy days of our gracious Queen? you know the philosophers are against you, yet dare you stand in handy grips wyth Cicero : you know that force is but an instrumet when counsell fayleth, and if wisedome win not, farwel warre. Aske Alphonsus what counsellors he lyketh of? hee will say his bookes. and hath not I pray you pollicy alwais ouermastered force? who subdued Hanibal in his great royalty? he ye durst knock at Rome gates to haue the opened is nowe become a pray to a sylly senator. Appius Claudius et senex et c aecus a father full of wisedome can releue the state of decaying Rome and was it force that subdued Mari us? or armes that discouered Catulins conspiracies? was it rash reuendg in punishing Cethegus? or want of witt in the discouerye of treason? Cato can correct himselfe for trauelling by Sea, when the land profereth passage, or to be fole hardy in ouer mutch hazard. Aristotle accompteth counsell holye, & Socrates can terme it the key of cercentye. what shal we count of war but wrath, of battel but hastines, and if I did rule (with Augustus C aelaer ) I woulde refuse these counselers. what made ye oracle I praye you accompt of Calchas so much? was it not for his wisedome? who doth not like of the gouerner that had rather meete with Vnum Nestorem then decem Aiatces? you cannot came a Lyon but in tyme, neither a Tigres in few dayes. Counsell in Regulus will preferring the liberty of his country before his lyfe, not remit the deliuery of Carthaginian wisedome preserued his citye. Adrian with letters can gouerne hys legions, and rule peasablye his prouinces by policye. aske Siluius Italicus what peace is and he will say? Pax optima rerum quas homini nouisse. datum est, pax vna triumphis Innumeris potior, pax custodier salutem Et ciues aequare potens. Candida pax homines, trux decet atra feras Well as I wish it to haue continuance, so I praye God wyth the Prophet it be not a bused, and because I think my selfe to haue sufficiently answered that I supposed, I conclude wyth this. God preserue our peaceable princes, & confound her enemies. God enlarge her wisedom, that like Saba she may seeke after a Salomon: God confounde the imaginations of her enemies, and perfit his graces in her, that the daies of her rule may be continued in the bonds of peace, that the house of the chosen Isralites may be maynteyned in happinesse: lastly I frendly bid Gosson farwell, wyshinge him to temper his penn with more discretion.
