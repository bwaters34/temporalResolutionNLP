[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] It hath been a mooted point with that class of philosophical inquirers, which so usefully occupies itself with discussions that can never be brought to a conclusion, whether the age gives the tone to literature, or literature to the age. It is a knotty question, and not being of the least consequence to any practical purpose, it will be passed over with the single remark, that it is quite useless for an author to write in good taste if the public won't read, and equally idle for the public to cherish a keen relish for polite literature, if there are no authors to administer food to its appetite. It is certain, however, that owing either to the excessive refinement and intelligence of the age, or it may be, to causes directly the contrary, the present taste of the venerable public is exceedingly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] carniverous. If any conclusion can be drawn from those classical productions which are so industriously hawked about by the genuine representatives of the illustrious "Dicky Doubt," who, by an allowable figure of speech, may be called the handmaids of the Muses, there must be an exceedingly voracious appetite in the reading community for all sorts of breaches of morality and breaches of the peace, not omitting smothering, poisoning, and suicide. Authors do not mind committing murder in cold blood, or perpetrating any other atrocious crime, any more than they do borrowing an idea from some old, forgotten writer; and the most timid, delicate, nervous lady in the land, who would shriek at the apparition of a caterpillar, or run away from a butterfly, is now so accustomed to battles, robberies, poisonings, and assassinations, that it would not be altogether surprising if we some day hear of one of the elite, after going the rounds of polite literature, and committing a few murders in the way of poisoning, together with some other fashionable et ceteras  \---not proper to mention by name, though the thing itself is highly aristocratic---should make a brilliant exit by blowing up a whole square of houses and perishing in their ruins. There was a time---it was in the dark ages, previous to the apotheosis of phrenology and animal magnetism--- there was a time when the records of crime, and those exhibitions of human depravity, which disgrace the name of man, and make angels weep, were confined to the romance of the police, and the last dying [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] speeches of convicted and converted murderers. A taste for these was considered as characteristic only of the vulgar and depraved, and they seldom ascended to the parlor or the drawing-room, except by stealth. At present, however, it appears that the most fashionable species of romance is a sort of Newgate calendar, in which the crimes and depravity of the lowest and worst species of real human beings, are cast into the shade by the creation of imaginary monsters. The reader, however, is not to conclude from these preliminary remarks that we meditate the presumption of finding fault with the prevailing taste for blood puddings, and concentrated soup of depravity. On the contrary, with the amateurs of thorough-going barbarity and wickedness, we are perfectly willing to defer to the taste of the venerable public for that species of meritorious romance, which, if anything can achieve it, will assuredly, in the shortest possible time--- with the aid of the "diggings" of California---bring about that Golden Age, when the saint and the assassin shall lie down in peace together; when the sword shall be turned into a bowie knife or a revolving pistol; firemen meet at midnight conflagrations without broken heads and bloody noses; and last and greatest miracle of all, the bright star of Bethlehem cease to be the torch of discord. We are full of hope that the time is not far distant, when the human heart shall become so mellowed and humanized by being accustomed to these pictured horrors, these atrocious crimes, and this total [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] degradation of the human species exhibited in polite literature that certain portions of select readers should in time lose all perception of the distinction between virtue and vice, and the good and bad mingle together in perfect harmony. Thus the world might at length be brought to a perfect good understanding, and no more blood be shed, except in romances. Doubtless the experiment is worth the trial, and we propose in this our second volume to flourish the besom of destruction somewhat liberally. Hitherto, we have only killed two or three honest people, in fair fight, and, as yet, not one of our actors is qualified for a hero of romance. But we shall do better in future, by introducing, in due time, a gentleman so utterly divested of any attribute that might redeem him from abhorrence, that he cannot fail to conciliate the favor of the judicious reader. It shall go hard with us, too, if we don't commit a most exemplary murder soon. If it comes not in our way, we will seek it. If we can't kill by retail, which is much the most emphatic and striking, we will go at it by wholesale, and demolish entire communities without regard to age, sex, color or condition. Should all our resources fail, we will murder our story and smother ourselves with charcoal to escape public justice. A Forest Scene---The Wild Man in the Wild Woods---A Short Speech Worthy the Imitation of the Wisdom of Congress---An Ingenious Mode of Trying the Patience---A Thunder Storm---The White Man Asleep when He Should Be Wide Awake. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] In the depths of the vast primeval forest, where echo had never replied to the axe of the woodman--- the great instrument of civilization, or the long resounding burst of the hunter's rifle---on the margin of a nameless lake, where dark waters, though pure as the skies, reflected no object of the earth, was assembled a band of red men, a race made for the shade, as the white man is for the sunshine. The lake was several miles in circumference, and lay in the centre of swamps whose limits were almost undefinable, and its approaches at that period only known to the savages who roamed its borders. It was a gloomy, wild, fantastic scene, silent as death, and melancholy as the grave, yet decked with a profusion of flowers, and flowering vines of gorgeous tints and various odor, that "wasted their sweetness on the desert air." There every production of nature, around the margin of the lake seemed to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] spring out of the water; for the land, if so it might be called, was nothing but floating earth, that quivered like a jelly under the light foot of the Indian. Vast cypress trees, with slender limbless trunks and tufted heads towering to the skies, and rocking with the slightest breeze, rose from the water apparently selfsupported on its surface; and with the exception of a level spot on the southern shore which loomed some ten or twelve feet above the surface of the lake, the entire margin was one dead level morass of decayed vegetables saturated with moisture. A numb and moody silence reigned far and near; no woodland minstrel caroled his joyous notes in these pathless wilds, whose unapproachable recesses were never cheered by the rays of the sun even in winter, for the trees were all evergreens and knew no change of seasons. At intervals during the day, a lonely woodpecker, the hermit of the forest, might be heard tapping some rough-barked tree; and sometimes the monarch eagle was seen in solitary majesty resting on a dry limb, silent and motionless, as if he were the guardian genius of this gloomy empire. The hour was near midnight, and a large fire around which a crowd of dusky figures were moving back and forth, tinged the melancholy cypress trees with a silvery lustre, and threw a long line of light athwart the dark water. It was an Indian council of the surrounding tribes, whose deputies had met together at this secret hour, in this secret haunt, to devise the plan of a general attack on the intruding white man, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] practice those preliminary rites, which were always the precursors of war to the knife. It is the characteristic of the savages of North America, that they have always some old injury to remember, or some new one to avenge. Though without historians to record their wrongs, they never forget them; and a legacy of revenge is handed down from generation to generation. Time never heals these wounds, however slight; and when these motives are wanting, a dream interpreted to suit the purpose, a whim of some old woman, a fraud of some mountebank, or a real or pretended desire to appease the spirits of the dead, is sufficient to rouse the ever restless savage to war and rapine. A war was now in contemplation which not merely involved a single tribe, but all the tribes within reach of the influence of the colony, together with their allies, and which had for its object the utter extermination of the whites, as well as the total destruction of their property. The civilized and savage men are two dry sticks; rub them together and they take fire. The causes which produced this combination of the Indian tribes were such as seem innate and inseparable from the irreconcilable relations of savage and civilized man, and will be passed over, as not material to our story. At the moment of which we are speaking, the final decision had been made; the deputies of all the tribes were agreed; the plan of operations concerted, and nothing now remained but to practice those religious rites and warlike ceremonies customary on such occasions. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] A chief who had fasted till the vapors of an empty stomach had ascended to his brains, and half-crazed his intellect, now came forward and addressed the dark assemblage as follows:--- "Brothers, I have had a dream. The great Spirit appeared to me in the shape of a bear, and said: The blood of your brothers is not yet wiped away. It smokes from the ground. The spirits of your fathers are not appeased. They wander about the spot where they fell, and disturb me with their shriekings. You must go and take scalps, burn houses, lay waste tobacco fields, and eat the long-knives. Say to your young men, take courage, dress your hair, paint your faces, sharpen your tomahawks till you cannot feel their edge, for the Great Spirit is with you. Go and avenge the dead, that their spirits may no longer wander on the face of the earth, howling like hungry wolves. The long-knife is fast asleep---go and wake him." This speech was answered by a shrill, withering howl, that quavered through the silent air, and awaked the echoes from their sleep. Songs, filled with boastings of exploits that might make the hair stand stiff, were sung, followed by a succession of dances, rehearsing the vicissitudes of war, and the various manoeuvres of Indian tactics, all exhibiting a variety of strange, grotesque motions, accompanied by harsh, dissonant music. When these were ended, the aged warriors proceeded to test the self-command of the young braves who offered themselves, for the first time, as candidates for service, and were to act under the immediate orders [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] of the great war-chief. It was a maxim with these strangely wise barbarians, that no man possessed true courage who is not master of his temper, on all occasions. Nature is more knowing than most people think her. The old warriors, accordingly, inflicted every possible insult, provocation, and outrage on the young candidates. They called them cowards, women, and threatened to dress them in petticoats; they accused them of running away from bears and wolves, nay, even the timid deer; they made faces at them, followed by the most contemptuous gestures; they beat them with cudgels, pricked them with knives; and, as a last effort, threw hot coals and blazing brands at their heads. All this was borne with the most stoical indifference, for if any one had exhibited the least sign of pain, anger, or impatience, he would have been considered disgraced, and unworthy to go forth to battle with men. After this came the great war feast, consisting entirely of the flesh of dogs, which, being their most valuable possession, was offered up to Areskoue, the god of battles. The feast being ended, they extinguished the fire, and slowly departed to their respective wilds, chaunting the song of death. The silence of the grave succeeded their departure, but their next coming was the signal for groans of agony, shrieks of despair, and shouts of demoniac triumph. A Scene not Uncommon in the Early Settlements of the New World--- Obstinacy of the Roundhead---A Massacre and a Siege---Unparralled Achievement of Gregory Moth---Langley Distinguishes Himself--- A Providential Shower and its Consequences---A Scene and a Reflection. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] The inhabitants of the colony, who were by these barbarous ceremonies devoted to destruction, remained not only ignorant, but unsuspicious of the destiny at hand. So many false reports and unfounded alarms had of late followed in succession, and passed away, that they, as a natural consequence, only produced an additional feeling of security. The savages had concealed their purpose with consummate art, and the infant of the new world lay sleeping in its cradle, unconscious that the serpent was coiling around him. Every station on either side of the river, except the capital, which was too strongly guarded for their simple tactics--- nay, every house was marked out, and a body of Indians expressly devoted to its destruction. The plan was laid with a cruel sagacity, and executed with equal silence and celerity. Not a human being, white or black, would have escaped, but for the compunction [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] of a half-civilized Indian, who paid the debt of gratitude by betraying his brothers. He was one of a small tribe which, some years previous to this period, had been nearly exterminated by the victorious Iroquois, the few survivors of which had sought refuge among the Indians of the South, and were received by adoption. Among them was a little lad, who, being ill of body, and worn out by a long, wearisome journey, was dropt by the way, and finally fell into the hands of Master Tyringham, where he became the companion of Langley, then a boy of about the same age. By degrees he grew to be a favorite; shared in Langley's studies, amusements, and occupations, until finally scarcely any difference appeared in the treatment of the white man's son, and the Indian boy. They became greatly attached to each other, and but for the difference of color might have passed for brothers. Somewhere about the age of sixteen, Langley was sent to pass the winter at the capital, with a friend of his father, with a view to polishing his manners, by intercourse with the little community, among which were many persons of liberal education and high breeding, some of whom had figured at courts in their day. Circumstances prevented the Indian boy from accompanying him, and he was left behind. From that moment he became melancholy and discontented. He no longer paid any attention to his studies, insomuch that Gregory Moth prognosticated that the Indian blood was up, and that nature was becoming too [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] strong for habit. His days were spent in wandering through the woods, or paddling on the river, and finally he disappeared to return no more. On the day succeeding the scene sketched in the preceding chapter, as Gregory was early in the morning scouring the wood in search of wild turkeys, he was half-frightened out of his wits, by the sudden apparition of an Indian, who approached him without arms, making signs of peace. Whether Gregory understood or not is a question, but certain it is, that at this instant his gun went off, but happily without doing any injury. The savage still approached, and coming up said with a smile--- "Your gun is bewitched, Master Gregory." Gregory trembled like a leaf, and replied only by the chattering of his teeth. The other then asked, "Don't you know me?" "No," said Gregory, somewhat restored by his gentle voice, and pacific deportment---"No, my acquaintance is not very extensive among gentlemen of your complexion." "That is rather strange. I was once a scholar of yours." "Hah!" quoth Gregory---eyeing him closely, "a scholar of mine! Let me look at you---but don't come a step nearer. Why---why---if it is not our Indian boy, I am a blind beetle. Where did you come from, where are you going, and what brought you here, after playing my master such a trick, you ungrateful salvage?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] "True, I am a savage, and will speak to you in the style of my native home. Listen---I see a black cloud in the sky." "Where?" said Gregory, looking upwards---"I don't see it." "No---the long-knife is asleep. He don't see anything. The cloud will burst soon, and then he will wake too late." "What do you mean by that? Speak out like a Christian, can't you." "The Great Spirit is angry with the long-knives. When the next sun is high up yonder, he will speak to them in blood and fire." "A murrain seize this metaphorical villain," thought Gregory, "he is as obscure as a Pagan oracle. I say, speak out. I can't understand your gibberish. Its all Greek to me." "The Indian talks his talk, and the white man his. But I will try to speak with the double tongue. Run--- fly like the deer to your master, and tell him from me, that this day---at the middle of the day, when the white man is resting from his labors, the red men will spring from the woods, like hungry wolves, and devour them all at a single meal. Tell him from me, to make the most of the few hours yet left him, or woe to him and his!" He paused a moment and added, "I have been ungrateful to the white man for his kindness, and am ashamed to meet him. Tell him the Indian cannot fight against his adopted tribe, nor join them in scalping the white man who has fed him. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] He will go and seek some other tribe far away. Be quick, long-knife, they will come at noon---let it not be night to you all." Thus saying, he bent his course towards the West, and was never seen again. His information, for a time, almost paralyzed Gregory, whose limbs and senses seemed equally to fail him. At length he recovered to a perception of his duty, and winged by fear, made the best of his way home, where he communicated his information to his master. It was now verging towards eight o'clock, of as fair a day as ever dawned upon the sunny South. Mild, gentle, and soothing, it irresistibly disposed the mind, as well as body, to languor and repose. But the tale of the Indian had effectually roused the inmates of the mansion, which in these early times, when danger lurked behind every tree, had been built with a view to defensive operations, though its materials were principally of wood. There was no other house of any pretensions within a distance of many miles, on that side of the river, but that of Harold Habingdon, which was by no means so well adapted to resist the Indian mode of attack, as that of his neighbor. In the castle all was hurry, and confusion. The massacre was to commence between twelve and one, when the field laborers would be resting themselves in languid indolence in the shade, or fast asleep in their cabins, and the masters shut up in their mansions to avoid the sultry summer heat. Every means of defence the brief period would permit was adopted, and messages sent out to give [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] warning on both sides of the river; but, alas! too late. In addition to this, Langley Tyringham took occasion to mention the defenceless state of Harold and his family. The old Cavalier's spirit rose within him, not in anger, but sympathy. He forgot the past, and only remembered the present hour, when a common danger demanded a common sympathy. "'Slife---that's true. The Crop-ear is more exposed than we are, and besides makes a point of conscience to offer no resistance in cases like this, as he told me not long ago, when I called to warn him against the savages. There is yet time---go to him. I see there a horse ready saddled at the door. Go, and entreat him to come hither instantly with his family and people. Say to him, from me, that danger should make us friends, and he shall be welcome. Be quick---not a moment is to be lost---mount and away! But mind you don't suffer his obstinacy to detain you too long." Langley mounted the horse, and gallopped full speed to Habingdon. Entering without ceremony, he found Harold apparently unconscious of the terrible calamity impending, and was received by him with an ungracious courtesy, by no means gratifying. Harold stiffly inquired his business, which was equivalent to an insinuation that nothing but that would excuse his visit; and Langley, without preface, communicated his errand. Harold had previously wrought himself into an obstinate doubt of the reality of the danger, and positively declined the invitation of his neighbor. He professed to rely on Providence, which, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] as he had never wronged the redmen, would doubtless incline their hearts in his favor. Langley besought him to come home to his father's. He painted in few words the indiscriminate vengeance of the savage, which spared neither age nor sex, and involved all in blood and fire; he entreated him, if not for his own, for the sake of his wife, his daughter and his dependents, who looked up to him for protection, to accept the invitation of his father, which he assured him was cordially given; and finally reminded him that the aid of Providence was only vouchsafed to those without other aid, or who made every effort to help themselves. The stern obstinacy of Harold became only more rigid and inflexible, under the increasing warmth with which it was assailed. A precious half hour was wasted, and the young man at length took his departure under the influence of feelings he had never experienced before. It was not alone compassion that tugged at his heart, but a stronger sentiment, which had been a nurseling in his bosom ever since that wise old gentleman, his father, had so judiciously proclaimed his edict of non-intercourse. The danger in which Miriam was placed took precedence, nay, swallowed up all other feelings for the moment, and he thought only of her. So young, so pious, so innocent and helpless, he bound himself by a solemn vow she should not perish if he could save her. On his departure Harold apprised Susan and Miriam of what he had just heard, his doubts of its truth, and his determination to await the event. They heard, and submitted in silence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] Susan had long since acquiesced in the supremacy of her husband in all cases not directly compromising her conscience, and the religion of Miriam was that of obedience. They retired and sought consolation in prayer. Langley galloped furiously home, and related to his father the ill success of his mission. At one time he thought of asking permission to return and endeavor, if possible, to protect those helpless women; but he recollected he had higher duties at home, and relinquished the design with a calm resolution to do his duty, and submit in silence to what seemed inevitable. The brief period preceding the expected attack was employed in various devices of defence which former experience had taught them; and these being completed, the hour had come that more than any other tries the strength of manhood---the hour of watchful caution, and of deep suspense---the hour of dread anticipation, ere action has conquered thought---the hour when the arm is idle and the fancy busy. It was indeed an interval of dreadful silence and grim repose; a stern, terrific calm---a crisis that tried the firmness of the soul, ere it called forth the strength of the arm. At length, when the sun had gained the midway of the sky, Langley, who was on the watch, suddenly saw on the opposite side of the broad river a hundred columns of smoke, beginning slowly to rise in various directions, as far as the eye could reach. The land was a rich alluvial plain, extending many miles, and constituting the most thickly settled, as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] well as best cultivated portion of the colony. Here, where every object was distinctly visible, he beheld men, women, and children, white and black, fleeing before the swift-footed Indian, brandishing his tomahawk, painted like a demon, and yelling like a fiend. Here he saw a white man bravely contending against fearful odds, with all the energies of despair, at last cut down, scalped, and hacked in pieces. There, and everywhere, there crowded upon his sight scenes the most horrible and inhuman---old men and little children, women and half-blown blooming girls---all shared the same fate in that bloody hour, and were offered up a sacrifice to savage vengeance, perhaps savage wrongs. It was another of the sore trials which so often occur amid a conflict of painful duties, that Langley was compelled to be a witness of this scene of horrors, without the power of administering aid to the wretched sufferers; for every moment a similar attack was anticipated. Still he proposed to his father to cross the river in the boat, if it were only to rescue one single victim from the grasp of these relentless barbarians. "Impossible," answered the old Cavalier---"It will be fatal to us, without being of the least service to them. The bloody scene will be over before we can cross the river, and with only the assistance of the overseer and Gregory, who is a notorious poltroon, what could we do? Unless our information is erroneous, we may expect an attack every moment, and might soon be called to defend our own hearth. In [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] this case, at least, charity begins at home, and our first duty is here. But, Langley," added he, as if suddenly recollecting himself---"there is yet a few moments, I hope, for another effort to overcome the obstinacy of that frost-bitten Crop-ear and his family. For himself, I care not---let him pay the penalty of his folly. But his poor wife, who really is a kind, good soul, though a little fanatical---and little Miriam, who, for one of the elect, is a good sort of a dowdy"---Dowdy! thought Langley---"they are not to blame, and I don't like the idea of their perishing miserably, as they most certainly will, if they remain where they are." "Shall I go to him once more," interrupted Langley impetuously." "Yes---quick as lightning! take Fireblood, who I have ordered to be kept saddled, and put him to whip and spur. The distance is but small, and possibly the sight of what is passing yonder may cool his confidence in savage discriminations. If the Crop-ear resists, knock him down, and run off with the women, whether they will or not. This is no time for ceremony. Be off instantly. I would go with you, only I am sure the Crop-ear and I would get into a quarrel." Langley required no spur, and in less than ten minutes had dismounted at Harold's door. He found him contemplating the scene on the opposite shore with deep and solemn emotion. "You see, sir," said Langley, "I am here again, and on the same errand. You can no longer doubt what will be the fate of yourself and family, if you remain [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] here. Your only chance of safety is in coming over and joining my father in defending his house, which is in some measure prepared. Once more, I beseech you to lose not a moment." "I have made up my mind, on principle," replied Harold. "I have not wronged these redmen, and I anticipate no revenge." "Is this your determination?" "Unalterably." "Where are the ladies, sir?" asked Langley, somewhat sharply. "Where they should be," replied Harold; "at their prayers." "Cannot I see them for one moment?" "To what purpose? But no matter---they are not to be seen." "But, by heaven, they shall be seen. Excuse me, sir. This is no time for ceremony. Life and death are on the moment"---and he darted past Harold into an inner room, where sat, or rather kneeled, the mother and daughter in silent devotion. The moment he entered, they rose, and Langley exclaimed, pointing to Harold, who had followed him--- " Your husband and your father is resolved you shall stay here and perish by the hands of yonder savages. I come, on the part of my father, to entreat--- to conjure him to take refuge in his house, which we can defend, at least for a time. But he refuses---he is determined that you shall both be murdered, scalped, and consumed in the flames of his dwelling. Go to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] him---fall on your knees to him---cling round his body--- clasp his knees, and pray him to avoid the double crime of sacrificing you, and murdering himself." Thus saying, he took them each by the hand, and led them to where the father stood, apparently unmoved. They kneeled at his feet---they embraced his knees---they caught his hands, bathed them with tears, and besought him to accept the offered refuge. "Harold," sobbed the faithful wife, "remember we are not now suffering for conscience' sake. We shall be murdered, not martyred. If we die, it will not be an offering to God, in testimony of the truth, but as victims to the false confidence of a husband and a father in the humanity of those who never spare. Ah! hark!" An Indian yell of triumph was heard across the river, announcing that the bloody work was done. The iron frame of Harold shivered with emotion, and his more than iron will was shaken to its centre by this appeal. He contemplated the only two beings that bound him to the earth, a few moments, in speechless tenderness; and, as a second yell sounded in his ear, raised up the pale supplicants, pressed them to his heart, and the martial spirit of his youthful days being once again aroused, exclaimed--- "Be it so. My own arm shall protect the wife of my bosom and the daughter of my affections. I will not trust them even to heaven." Few, very few preparations were made, and right speedily they left the house they were never to revisit more. The emigrants consisted of Harold, Susan, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] Miriam, and Mildred---the affrighted slaves being dispersed in all directions, no one knew whither. They were received by the old Cavalier, with the warm welcome of a frank and generous spirit. His excellent wife---who we have not yet mustered among our active, disposable force, because we have already as many troops on hand as we can manage---his excellent wife was no way behind her husband in hospitable demonstrations; and the logical Gregory, who was suffering under a severe fit of the ague, was greatly comforted at the new recruits to the garrison, though they added to its numbers more than its strength---for "Misery loves company," quoth Gregory Moth. The dread repose which, for a brief period, followed, was at length interrupted by the appearance of a band of painted warriors, cautiously emerging from the thick forest, that extended from some quarter of a mile distance to heaven only knows where. Silent and cautious as beasts of prey on their bloody midnight rounds, their dark faces were seen peeping from behind the trees, and their leaders exchanging vehement gestures with each other. Being, at length, apparently satisfied that no enemy lurked in ambush, they advanced warily towards the mansion, exercising all their savage arts in making their approaches, under cover of the outbuildings, and keeping in the range of that part of the house having the fewest windows and doors. Not a mouse stirred, not a word was spoken above a whisper within, and the savages at length concluded that the place had been abandoned. Still with habitual caution [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] they advanced, crawling like serpents in the grass, with the intention of plundering and setting it on fire. The Cavalier had laid his plan of defence with great skill, as became an old soldier. The few men were placed at different loop-holes, primed and loaded, with positive directions not to fire, till the order was given, and the women, having refused to retire to an inner apartment, were to supply the ammunition as it might be wanted. The savage band was still sliding along in the grass, their heads scarcely visible, and every gun was pointed with deadly aim, each at its peculiar victim, awaiting the word to fire, when Gregory, who was placed at one of the loop-holes, in an ecstasy of fear, unconsciously pulled the trigger, discharging his piece at random, and without effect. The savages uttered a yell, started up, and retreated under cover of one of the outhouses. "Victory! victory!" shouted Gregory, "I have routed the copper-colored catiffs. See how they scamper." His exultation was, however, speedily checked by his master, who without saying a word, seized him by the shoulder, conducted him to the cellar, and locking him in, put the key in his pocket. An hour, or more elapsed without the re-appearance of the redmen, and it began to be hoped, that Gregory had indeed discouraged them from any further attacks. But this hope was soon dispelled by the advance of the enemy, from behind the barn, each with a lighted torch. It was evidently their intention to fire the house, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] force its inmates either to perish in the flames, or come forth to meet even a more cruel death. Again every gun was pointed with a steady aim, and at a signal from the old Cavalier the fire was given---three savages fell, and some others limped off in the rear, as the main body retreated once more to their cover, yelling with rage and disappointment. Another pause ensued---a dreary pause---filled up by the spectacle of the conflagration of Harold's residence, which was distinctly seen from that of Master Tyringham. A detachment from the beseiging party had plundered, set it on fire, and were dancing like demons around the ruins. The fugitives contemplated the spectacle in silent sorrow; but the thought of what would have happened had they been there, reconciled them to their loss, and they were grateful. A new and nearer danger now presented itself. The savages were seen emerging from behind the stables, pushing a wagon laden with straw before them, and which almost completely protected them, as they advanced. There was no doubt as to their object, which was to set fire to the straw, when the wagon was near enough to communicate it to the building. This manoeuvre at once baffled all their previous arrangements for defence. There was no time to concert means to counteract it, and each man was left to his own resources. It was in vain they kept up a continued fire; the Indians, sheltered behind the straw, escaped their aim, and continued pushing the wagon steadily in a direction to windward of the house. At [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] this moment of dread suspense and imminent peril, Langley suddenly exclaimed---"There is but one way"---and rushing towards the kitchen, returned with a blazing firebrand. "What now?" asked his father. "Nothing---nothing, sir,"---replied he, hastily. "Don't stop me---a moment and it will be too late." He then made for a door which opened in the direction of the approaching danger, and in so doing, passed close to Miriam, who had acted the part of a little heroine, during the siege, and who suddenly grasped his arm, as if to detain him. He paused at the interruption, and Miriam, as if recollecting herself, snatched away her hand, bent down her eyes, and spoke not a word. Before any one was aware of his design, he had hastily opened the door, which was fortunately in a direction that hid it from the savages, advancing, and tugging behind the load of straw, and darted forward in the same line of direction until without being seen, he had applied the brand to the dry straw, which in an instant was in a blaze. He then retreated full speed, but was detected in his flight, and saluted by a shower of arrows, one of which lodged in his shoulder, and remained quivering there, as he rushed in, and closed the door. It was speedily drawn by the overseer, who was one of the garrison, and like most of his class, had a smattering of surgery; the blood was staunched, and Langley, though suffering much pain, persisted in remaining on duty, so long as he could point a rifle, or draw a trigger. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] But this daring diversion produced not its merited consequences. The fire having been speedily extinguished before it gained the mastery, the wagon was pushed still nigher and nigher; and as if to aid the savages in their design, the wind suddenly rose to a gale. They redoubled their exertions, and at length having succeeded in spite of the exertions of those within, in placing the wagon in contact with the house, they set it on fire, and stood under its cover, shouting in triumph. "Our time is come"---said Harold, in a calm, steady voice---"death is inevitable, but there is at least a choice how we shall die. How say you, friends, shall we perish in the flames, or die fighting like men? It is a righteous cause, when life and all that makes life dear is at stake. This life is as often a choice of evils as of good. Follow me, friends, and remember the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Come Susan---come Miriam---if it please God, we will die together. Keep close to me, both." Langley now stept forward, and offered his protection to one or either of the poor desolate women, whose habits of submission to the will of the husband and father were so confirmed by long years, that they spoke not a word, but bowed in silence to Harold's behest. They had clung to him in life, and were willing to follow him to death. "You cannot protect them both," said Langley. "Both!" replied Harold; "God only can protect them. Alas! a little while ago, I said I would not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-264.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] trust them even to His keeping; I am punished for my blasphemy." "But I entreat you, sir, for the sake of others, if not for your own." "Enough---no more, Master Langley; in this hour of mutual extremity, when all of us are destined to one common fate, all differences should be forgotten, at least for the present. I would accept thy offer; but, look yonder! There," said he, pointing to Mistress Tyringham, "there bides your watch. A higher and holier duty calls you. To her who owes her being to me, I will give my care; to her who gave you being, give thine, and die for or with her as Heaven shall will. Now let us go forth and perish by the tomahawk rather than by fire. Langley bowed low, and placed himself beside his mother. He exchanged a look with Miriam more expressive than words, and all stood ready prepared to sally forth in the last extremity. In the mean time the flames rose, and spread throughout the mass of straw; the dry pine boards began to smoke, and soon the lively flames ran swiftly along their edges. The moment for making a last desperate effort had arrived; the father and children, the husband and wife, had exchanged a last embrace, and Langley had whispered something in Miriam's ear that changed her deadly paleness into a ruddy glow; when, suddenly, a black cloud, which had been approaching unheeded, sent forth a vivid flash, followed by a burst of thunder that seemed to announce the interposition of a higher power. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-265.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] The cloud opened its bosom, and a deluge of rain descended with such volume, as well as fury, as in a few minutes entirely extinguished the spreading flames, and drove the savages into the stables for shelter, where they stood awed into silence, until the chief addressed them:--- "The Great Spirit of the white man protects the longknife, and says he must live. Let us return home, lest he should be angry with us for opposing his will. Let him live to tell the story of this day, and teach his children how the redman avenges his wrongs." Under the influence of this feeling they all assented; and taking up their killed and wounded, retired into the recesses of the forest, chaunting the song of death. The little garrison, after awaiting in silent awe the passing away of the providential shower, and finding the savages did not make their appearance, proceeded to consult on what was best to be done. It was unanimously resolved to remain on the watch till next morning, and if no attack was made in the interim, it might be safely inferred that all danger was over, at least for that time. The night passed away in anxious suspense, but without any alarms; and on the morrow, a party went warily forth without meeting the enemy. On a careful examination their tracks were traced in the wet ground till they entered the forest, and it was the unanimous opinion they had departed not to return. Feeling now a sense of security, their thoughts [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-266.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] reverted to the melancholy scene they had witnessed on the opposite shore, where every appearance of life and animation had ceased. The savages had departed after finishing their bloody business, leaving nothing but ruin and death behind them. One dreary, deathlike solitude extended for many miles along either side of the river; and, save those of Master Tyringham, not a single building was standing. The whole country wes scathed with fire. The nest of the toiling emmet was broken up; the labor of lives reduced to ashes; the meed of dangers, hardships, exile and privation, for long, suffering years, swept away in a single hour, and the owner of the fields lay a mangled victim among their ruins. A party from Master Tyringham's passed over with a view to rescue any survivor that might chance to have escaped, and to bury the dead. The scene was equally calculated to awaken both pity and vengeance. Here lay a grey-headed Cavalier, who had fought bravely, for his hands were cut to the bone in grasping the Indian knife; close by his side was his wife, who had accompanied him to the New World to share his fate; and between them a young woman, doubtless their daughter, with her head cleft asunder by a tomahawk, and reft of its crown of glossy hair. Here and there lay little infants with their brains dashed out; and more than once they encountered one of these innocent victims clasped in the arms of its mother, or its faithful black nurse, who had perished with it. Last of all, lay a banished, wandering Quaker, whose non-resistance little availed him here. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-267.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] Some were basking in the burning sun, and some lay half consumed in the still smoking ruins, and all had undergone the bloody Indian rite of scalping. Men, women, infants, not one was spared. Black and white lay side by side; and the slave had ascended with his master to the judgment seat of Him who knows no distinction. So rolls the wheel of time, and crushes as it rolls. Shall we while lolling in the lap of security, enjoying the rich legacy of peace and prosperity bequeathed us by our forefathers, who paid so dearly for it, rise up in judgment against them, if in avenging this bloody tragedy, they took care to prevent its repetition? Forbid it, justice! or if not justice, forbid it, gratitude! The pioneers of the New World came here under the sanction of rights universally recognized by all Christian nations; they occupied their early possessions by purchase, or by donation of the savages; and for a long time afterwards their weakness placed them under the immediate obligation of self-defence, the first law of nature. Resuscitation of Gregory Moth---How Accident sometimes Disconcerts the Projects of Wise Men---Decisive Consequences of Turning to the Right instead of the Left---Sensible Cogitations of a Young Man about Falling in Love---Another Accident Leading to a Long Talk, which, as Is commonly the Case, Ends in Nothing particular. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-268.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] While the events recorded in the preceding chapter were in progress, Gregory Moth had remained ensconced in the dire donjon-keep to which he was consigned by his master. Nor was he, in truth, at first altogether discontented with his situation, as it placed him entirely beyond the reach of the Indian arrows. But there being no window on that side of the cellar where the savages were making their approaches, his solicitude to know what was going forward soon became exceedingly troublesome, and in process of time the dead silence that prevailed gave rise to a thousand thronging apprehensions. He was suffering the martyrdom of fear, when all of a sudden his nostrils were grievously assailed by a strong effluvia of smothered smoke, which threw him into an agony, or rather an ague. He concluded at once that the house was on fire, and gave himself up for a lost man. The moment all hope was over, he quietly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-269.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] resigned himself to his fate; for the desperation of cowardice is often a substitute for manly resignation. He was roused from this state of abject despair, by the flashes of lightning that penetrated his dungeon, and the loud peals of thunder that rolled over his head, followed by the pelting shower, which occurred so opportunely. After this, a dead silence again ensued, and he was left to his own conjectures, which finally ended in a profound sleep, produced by the struggles of his mind and exhaustion of body. Here he lay undisturbed, being forgotten by all amid the apprehensions each one entertained for his own safety, and in the contemplation of the desolation around. It so happened, however, that early in the morning of the day succeeding the raising of the seige, it became necessary to procure some articles of comfort or convenience from the cellar, and one of the colored serfs, who it should have been before noted, had been safely gathered in their master's fold, on the first alarm, was dispatched for that purpose. Cuffee, or, as he was usually called by Gregory, old King Cole, was a native of Africa, with a face that glistened like a well-polished boot, luxuriating in the splendors of patent blacking. Descending into the cellar, which was rather darkish, King Cole stumbled over the body of Master Gregory, who was solacing his hunger, which now began to be rather imperative, with another nap. Being taken by surprise, the gentleman of color pitched head foremost against the stone wall of the cellar, but being [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-270.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] providentially provided with a competency of woolly hair, escaped without any material damage. "Gosh!" exclaimed King Cole, rubbing his pate--- "what dat dare yeer?" "I am a sort of living creature," quoth Gregory, "very like a man, I believe, though I can't be certain, in this dubious light." "Hey! Masser Gregory---you hide away from Indian here---hey?" "I hide from the Indians! thou discolored specimen of the genus man---I scorn your words. My master sent me here to forfeit daylight, and starve in a dungeon, because I did utterly discomfit and put to flight the copper-colored catiffs, with my single arm, and he wanted to get all the credit of the victory to himself. But Cuffee---good Cuffee---if thou hast the bowels of a woodcock, I do beseech thee in thy merciful cruelty, and pitiful hardheartedness, to petition my master to let me out. I am, as it were, on the extreme edge of starvation, and could make a glorious meal on pickled grasshoppers. Go now---do, mine honest Cuffee, and solicit earnestly for my release. I will reward thee with the stump of my old pipe." King Cole graciously condescended to this pleading, and communicated it to his master. "Bless my soul!" exclaimed the Cavalier---"I had quite forgot poor Gregory, though some how or other, I felt as if I missed something. Poor fellow---he must be as hungry as a wolf by this time. Send him hither---I must beg his pardon." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-271.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] King Cole obeyed with all the dignified solemnity of a favorite household servant; but Master Gregory instead of waiting to receive apologies, had made tracks towards the kitchen, where finding breakfast ready, he sat down without saying grace, to the great discontent of Goody Mildred, and solaced himself with a degree of satisfaction quite exemplary. And now, having released friend Gregory, and placed him status ante bellum  , we feel at perfect liberty to proceed in our narrative with a clear conscience. Some doers of romances seem so entirely destitute of humanity, that they will leave a man just on the point of drowning, or with a house burning over his head, or a sword through his body, while they lead the gentle reader a dance no one knows where, leaving the poor victim all the while in this imminent jeopardy. We remember a grievous case of this kind, in which a very interesting young lady fell overboard into the lake of Geneva, in the first chapter of a romance, and was not rescued till the middle of the second volume, the author being occupied all that time in discussing a question of politics. But, thank our stars, we were not born under Saturn, to feel pleasure in devouring our own children, for such we consider the personages of our story. The destruction of the abode of Harold Habingdon made it absolutely necessary for himself and family to continue under the roof of Master Tyringham, until some other refuge could be provided. Every other building for a wide circuit around had been consumed; and though the little capital of the colony had escaped, in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] consequence of being protected by wooden defences, guarded by a company of soldiers, it was at a distance of many miles. Hospitality is the virtue of the new world, and the old Cavalier, to do him justice, not only frankly offered his house, but insisted on the family remaining his guests, until provided with another residence. Harold did not relish the proposal; it went against the grain. But there seemed no other alternative, and after a degree of hesitation that made the old Cavalier feel quite belligerent, rather stiffly, and ungraciously, signified his acceptance. Thus Langley and Miriam became inmates of the same home in spite of the stern decision of their fathers; and thus did what could not be foreseen, baffle all the foresight of these calculating worms. Were it not for fear of being stigmatized as a turbaned Turk, one might almost be tempted to believe that what is called the chapter of accidents is the book of fate. The wound of Langley Tyringham, though not dangerous was slow and lingering in its cure. But at the expiration of a week he was able to leave his room, and sit out on the piazza, where the refreshing breezes from the river seemed to infuse new life and vigor into his frame. Here he was sometimes joined by different members of the family, in social chat; we cannot say cheerful chat; for the deep impression of the recent massacre, joined to the wide-spread desolation that everywhere presented itself, depressed the jocund, airy spirit of youth, and turned the gravity of age to sober melancholy. When Harold announced to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] his wife and daughter the arrangement he had made, he contented himself with gravely, almost sternly, reminding the latter of his former conversation on the subject of Langley, and repeating his prohibition of all intercourse, as far as it could be avoided, without direct offence to their host and his family. In spite of filial duty, Miriam could not help thinking these restrictions unreasonable, as regarded herself, and ungrateful towards those who had opened their house and their hearts to receive them. Still, she offered no objection, but as usual acquiesced in his wishes with silent resignation. She was obedient, as well from a habit of duty, as from the dictates of conscience. The deportment of Harold towards her, though in the main kind and affectionate, was rigid and inflexible in all matters involving what he termed principle. He checked the vivacity of her youth, and was intolerant of all those little amusements, or recreations that had for their object merely whiling away the hour, and dissipating that weary listlessness, always the lot of childhood, when in the absence of all capacity to be useful it resorts to trifles for amusements. Thus, instead of growing up among the flowers, her early days were passed in the shade of her father's pious gloom. In her infancy, she was never a child, in her youth, she was never young. Perhaps it was all for the best, and that this stern discipline prepared her to endure with patience the severe trials she was destined to encounter. Though she avoided Langley, as much as possible, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-274.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] without absolute rudeness, strange as it may appear to some, the less she enjoyed his society, the more she thought of him. She dwelt on his daring courage in venturing forth to almost certain death, to save the lives of his parents, her parents and herself. Had he risked his life for her alone, she could not have been more grateful. Nay, her feelings were only the more fervent, when she remembered that those she most cherished on earth were involved in the fate from which he had ventured his life to rescue her. Langley remained for weeks pale and languid, and pity allied itself with gratitude---a most formidable confederacy in the heart of woman. The robustuous Cavalier, who pitched head foremost into everything, whether a stone wall, or a feather bed, had in like manner, in his summary mode of intimating his wishes, signified to Langley, that though as a Virginia gentleman, he had invited the family of the Roundhead to his house, after losing their own, he must distinctly understand that the edict of non-intercourse was still in full force. The wise old gentleman concluded by positively prohibiting his son from falling in love with the little Crop-ear, since he would never consent to mix his blood or his name with that of a rebel to his king, and an apostate from his mother church. The reader is not to presume from this reference to mother church, that Master Tyringham was a very religious man. The honest truth of the matter is, that though he had fought for the thirty-nine articles, and was ready to fight again, it would have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] puzzled him mightily to tell what they were. But people may have a vast deal of bigotry without much religion. However this may be, Langley assured his father, and that with sincerity, that he had not the least intention of making love to Miriam; whereupon the worthy Cavalier departed, highly satisfied with the wisdom of his precaution. Left alone, the young gentleman began to chafe a little on the bit. He was now of age---witness the sturgeon's head, and the profound nap in his chair. Without overrating himself, he thought he was man enough to resist being treated as a boy or tied to his father's watchchain. In short, he waxed rebellious, and meditated an insurrection. It was well, he thought, that he was not in love with Miriam, else he might be tempted to woo her, if only to assert his independence. Then by a very natural transition, he recalled to mind the sweet and pious composure, with which she had met the almost certain approach of a horrible death. He dwelt on her pale, placid brow, her deep, feeling eye, as it often watched him in his efforts for her defence; nor did he forget the involuntary eagerness with which she grasped his arm, and suddenly relinquished it, as heretofore related. There were certain looks she had directed towards him, while the arrow was extracting from his shoulder, which penetrated deeper than his wound, and made a more lasting impression. Finally, having lived much alone in his boyhood, he was accustomed to soliloquize in thought, and the following may [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-276.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] serve as a specimen of what occurred to his mind whenever he was at leisure and alone. "How strange it seems, that those religious and political antipathies, which set us together by the ears in the old world, should extend to the new. What if her father raised his arm against his lawful sovereign? For all their claim to divine right, kings are but men, for they die like other men, and if people are punished with death for rebelling against their sovereign, I don't see why a sovereign may not be punished for rebelling against his people. It strikes me, that kings may conspire against the just rights of their subjects, as well as subjects against the lawful prerogative of the sovereign. If you punish one, why not the other? As to high church and low church, I don't see that there is any great difference, where there are no loaves and fishes to scramble about. Surely it is not only absurd, but cruel to persecute those who have themselves fled from persecution. How can people tell whether they are treading in the paths of truth, or wandering in the slough of error, except as the Bible teaches them, not as the Bible is interpreted by those who with all their arrogance, do not pretend to inspiration? As to poor Miriam, she is a dear little soul, as innocent as a lamb, and as pious as a saint. She follows the faith of her father, as I do that of mine. If we were married---not that I have the least inclination that way---but if by some unaccountable accident we were to marry, we might go to the same church, for we are both Christians, without disputing about points of faith when we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-277.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] came home. It is true, she sings rather long hymns, but her voice is so sweet, it does my heart good to hear her. To be sure, there might be some difficulty about the children. Pshaw! what the deuce am I thinking about"---and Master Langley concluded his soliloquy in a huff, by setting forth to cool himself in a contemplative walk. It was verging towards sunset, and this was the first time he had ventured to take a stroll, since he received the arrow in his shoulder. He naturally bent his way towards the water, for there is an irresistible attraction in the running brooks, the silvery lake, and the winding river. The playful child, happy in its innocent thoughtlessness, loves to scamper along its white, sandy shore, and ever and anon, bathe its feet in the cold water; the lusty boy delights to hurl the skipping stone athwart its glassy surface, and count with exultation the number of its leaps; and the caretired spirit, laden with tears and sorrows, is coaxed for a while into resignation or forgetfulness, by its soothing murmurs. Just before the spirit moved the young philosopher to indulge in an evening stroll, that mysterious sympathy, which the reader must already have observed, had unaccountably produced a concert of action, between Langley and the little Crop-ear girl---had impelled Miriam to put on her primitive bonnet, with the self-same design. She had been accustomed to walk abroad at will since the illness of Langley, feeling no apprehension of meeting him, and Harold had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-278.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] indulged her under a like conviction. Langley had not proceeded far, when he saw something he took for a woman, slowly pacing along, as if in deep contemplation. He had a presentiment who it was, and respecting the command of his father, changed his course, several points of the compass, by which manoeuvre he placed a thick copse of wood betwixt him and the enemy. Miriam had also seen him coming towards her, and moved by a similar impulse of duty, diverged a little at first, until she placed herself under shelter of the self-same copse, after which she turned short about, and bent her steps towards the house, on the opposite side of the cover. Without a map, we despair of giving a clear idea of their juxta-position; but certain it is, that these mutual endeavors to avoid each other suddenly brought them together, face to face, in turning a sharp angle of the wood. The truth is, there is no resisting destiny, and it is useless to argue the point. The face of Miriam, naturally pale, and that of Langley rendered so by his late indisposition, both became suddenly flushed at this awkward and unsought meeting. To pass without speaking, or to speak without stopping, would have savored of discourtesy, and accordingly the young gentleman addressed the young lady, halting at the same time. It is believed---nay, it is certain, that his first remark had reference to the weather, that never failing and---let people say what they will---that interesting subject, which in some way or other, enters into almost all the concerns of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] life. Certain pert writers, aspiring to more fashionable topics, have sneered at this common-place topic, but after all, it is better to talk of the weather, than to scandalize our neighbors, or play dummy, like two John Bulls, when they meet together after a long absence. "What a delightful evening," quoth Langley. "Delightful," echoed Miriam; and they rung the changes on this head, reiterating the same ideas, if not the same words, until it is believed they scarcely knew what they were saying. Whether this unconsciousness extended to what they were doing, is doubtful, but certain it is, that contrary to all approved canons of courtesy, instead of the gentleman turning about with the lady, the lady turned back with him, without being aware of her condescension; and in place of returning to the house, they proceeded the other way, still harping on the beauty of the evening. All on a sudden, however, Miriam changed the subject, and fixing her eyes on his face, said in a voice betokening an interest in the subject--- "You are very pale, and must be tired with your walk---let us return." "Tired, what makes you think so? Is it because you are tired of me?" said Langley jestingly. "Why---why---because you look so. You are so pale and thin; I am sure you must be weak and weary." "Indeed, you are mistaken, I never felt better in health, or happier in spirit, than at this moment." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] There was probably something in the tone, manner, or look, which accompanied these words, that caused a slight suffusion on the cheek of Miriam. "Do you think there is no danger from the savages?" said she hastily. "None. They will not return. They have pretty well done their bloody business. Besides, they will soon have enough to do in defending themselves. We are preparing an expedition to avenge their cruelties, and if possible forever prevent their repetition." "And do you go with it?" "Certainly. Every man that can carry a weapon, or put one foot before the other will go, and do his best to avenge the blood of his kindred and friends." "By shedding his own. But you are not yet fit to go on such an errand. You are scarcely recovered from your wound, and should stay at home to protect us poor women." "I am quite able to pull a trigger, and can best protect you, by destroying your enemies." "Yes!"---answered she, with a deep feeling---"yes, by leaving them alone to their fearful apprehensions, awakened by every falling leaf, or whisper of the air; to feed on their miserable anxieties for your fate---to a conflict of hopes and fears, that only ends in the certainty of a broken heart. Do not go---I entreat thee not to go. Do not leave us---I---I---speak in behalf of thy mother." "Would you have me stay at home to be despised as a coward?" cried Langley, deeply moved by her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-281.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] gentle solicitude---"would you have me called coward--- tell me, Miriam?" "No," replied she, firmly---"My father is a Christian soldier, and has often told me that courage is the great safeguard of the virtues of man, since without it he may be frightened out of them all, and commit the deepest crimes through the instigation of fear. I would not have you be afraid of anything on earth, but doing wrong. But I wish you could remain with us, without incurring a name all women hate and men despise. When do you go?" "The day after to-morrow." "Indeed---so soon. And when do you return?" "When it pleases Heaven. Perhaps never." "Perhaps so," said Miriam in a low voice---"let us return home. We have committed a fault to our fathers. Let us go and ask forgiveness." Langley made no attempt to detain her, and they turned towards the house, apparently little disposed for further conversation. Miriam Sets an Example to all Dutiful Daughters---Poses Her Mother with a Knotty Question---Some Prosing about Humdrum Domestic Matters---A Love Scene between Mildred and Gregory Moth---Sketch of a Character, and sundry Other Matters. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-282.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] Harold Habingdon was now busily employed in erecting a temporary wooden building for the occupation of his family, and had frequent occasion to visit the capital to obtain supplies of materials. It was during one of these journeys there that the accidental meeting recorded in the preceding chapter occurred, and consequently, Miriam, for the present, escaped a lecture for her involuntary transgression. Like a dutiful daughter, she, however, immediately disclosed it to Susan; for her pure and innocent soul never once harbored the idea of concealing any act or thought from her mother. She, therefore, frankly told the whole story, or at least intended to do so. But, somehow or other, it was no more like what actually occurred, than the practice of certain very moral and religious people is to their professions. She said not a word about looks, tones, and other accompaniments, which are as essential to the proper understanding of a subject as the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-283.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] expression of the face is to a likeness in a picture. Susan was a kind, rather than an indulgent mother; and though she seldom commanded her daughter, expected obedience to her wishes. She gently chid Miriam for not returning home immediately. "Would you have done so, mother, if you had been me?" said Miriam, with perfect simplicity. "Why, I don't know whether I would, child. Come, let us go spin." The period of departure for the capital to join the garrison and the few planters that survived the massacre in the expedition projected by the governor against the hostile savages, had now arrived. Harold had returned, and having been cured of his scruples by the scene he had just witnessed, voluntarily consented to be one of the party; and the old Cavalier and his son panted for an opportunity of retaliating on the Indians the murder of their friends and neighbors. It was felt by all that a decisive struggle was at hand, which might decide for ages, perhaps for ever, whether this portion of the earth was to remain a wild, unfruitful heritage of savage man, or the wilderness come in time to blossom as the rose, by the magic of labor. The evening preceding the morning of the departure of these adventurous spirits on this fatiguing and dangerous service was passed in grave and solemn converse, interrupted by long pauses of painful thought and gloomy anticipation. Many were the cautions of the good dames to their helpmates to be careful of the nightly dews, and morning fogs; and most especially [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-284.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] were they adjured to keep clear of all trees behind which the prowling savage might lurk, and launch his feathery arrows. Good Mistress Tyringham especially reminded her husband that she had packed up his nightcap and slippers; whereupon the old Cavalier kissed her and, though not in merry mood, laughed in his sleeve while telling her he did not think he should have much occasion for such rarities. The hour of parting came, for they were to start bright and early next morning. It was brief, solemn, and sad. At the last moment Miriam gave her hand to Langley; he felt a warm tear fall on his, and heard a soft tremulous whisper---"Take care of yourself for all our sakes." "The tear, thought he, may have been for her father, but the words were for me;" and he often dwelt on them as he lay awake in the deep forest at night, listening to the wolf's long howl, or the shrill hootings of the solitary owl. The Indian warfare is no child's play. The American savage is equally crafty and daring; he moves like a shadow, leaving no track behind him; instinct and experience have endued him with a sagacity which often puts to shame the boasted reason of civilized man, and forces from him an acknowledgment of his inferiority. In courage he is a hero, in fortitude a martyr. A union of the virtues of a North American Indian with those of a civilized Christian white man would be a great improvement in the human species. But experience has shown that the mingling of the blood of the two races rather combines their vices than their virtues, and produces a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-285.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] being inferior to both. The white man is the great aristocrat of the creation, and cannot amalgamate with any other color without being soiled by the contact. The march of our wayfarers was through a long unbroken succession of woods and wilds, where no milestone marked the distance, or fingerpost pointed out the way. By the aid of Indian guides they were enabled to follow the trail of the Indian party that had desolated the colony, until, on the thirteenth day, they tracked them to the village of the great chief who had led the massacre. Crouching low in the thick forest that approached to within a few hundred yards of the village, they waited in breathless silence till the sun went down, and the shadows of evening gathered around. They could see that preparations had been made for a grand feast in celebration of their victory over the white man, and as soon as it was dark, hundreds of wild savages, men, women, and children, issued forth from their cabins carrying lighted torches, with which they set fire to a vast pile of pine knots, which anon lighted into a blaze that shed a red and angry lustre on the scene. Painted like fiends, and decorated with fantastic yet picturesque grace, the warriors danced around the fire, to the music of triumphant yells, brandishing the tomahawk, and howling forth their exploits in the victory they were now celebrating. One warrior sung in a sort of recitative how he had slaughtered the long-knives, and cast them still quivering with life into the burning flames; another boasted of the women he had cut down and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-286.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] scalped, as they shrieked with agony; and a third acted over again the massacre of innocent babes, their brains dashed out, and their bodies trampled in the dust, or cast among the smoking ruins of the home where they were born. The blood of the white man boiled in his veins at hearing these bloody stories. Some of the victims, whose fate was now rehearsed with such triumphant exultation, had been their friends; some their near relations; and among the lookers on were those who mourned the loss of wives and children. But for the near prospect of a surer vengeance, it would have been impossible to restrain them from instant action; for the scene and the recollections it brought to mind almost made them mad. The leaders urged, over and over again, that it would be best to wait till the feast was over, and the tired savages sleeping away their debauch; but when at length they saw the scalps of their kindred, friends, wives, children, brothers and fathers, brought forth, and suspended from poles, round which the savages danced in triumph, they could no longer be restrained. Both Langley and Harold, in whispered tones of deep determination, declared, that however bitter and bloody the aggression, they could not bring themselves to await the hour proposed, when the disarmed Indians, become insensible from drunkenness, would be unworthy victims, incapable of resistance or atonement. It was true, they would at all events be taken by surprize, but they were armed, and so far capable of defending themselves, that it would not be rank [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-287.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] cowardice to attack them. The old Cavalier seconded these remonstrances, and an immediate attack was determined on. The plan of operations had been previously settled, and the long-knives, who were not sufficiently numerous to surround the village, emerging from the forest with silent celerity, were upon the savage revellers ere they were aware of their coming. The Indians, though taken by surprise, did not fly, with the exception of the women and children. Elated by their late success, and by the boastings and revellings of the night, they met their foes without flinching. Man to man, teeth to teeth, they met, and tugged and struggled for life. No quarter was asked or given, for the long-knife well knew the tortures inflicted by the savages on their prisoners, and the savages felt that they were now about to atone for their recent massacre. Death or victory was the only alternative, and death or victory the only thought. Each one fought for himself, and every man was a unit. None heard, none heeded the word of command, if any such was given, for now men had no ears to hear, or eyes to see, aught but the groans of the dying, or the bodies of their foes. The fires went out, and still they fought by the light of the stars, that seemed to shine brighter than ever on the bloody scene, unconscious and uncaring. Many gallant deeds were done that night, and many a gallant spirit, red and white, never saw the morning. But we will not enter into particulars. There is enough of bloodshed in the pages of authentic history, one would think, to satiate the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-288.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] keenest appetite, and we shall only say, that when the sun rose that day, and smiled on the open space in front of the village, he saw nothing but smoking ashes, and earth smoking with blood. The women and children had fled into the woods, at the first surprise; but the red armed warriors, had died to a man on the ground where they stood, and the village had been set on fire. So ended for this time the war between the white man and the red, a war "never ending, still beginning, fighting still, and still destroying." The surprise had given the long-knives such a decided advantage, that their loss was comparatively small. Of the trio, in which the reader is doubtless most interested, Langley escaped with a contusion received by a blow from an Indian club; Harold with a few hard knocks, and the old Cavalier came off scot free, bringing home his night-cap and slippers in triumph. During this brief campaign, Miriam and her mother said their prayers and plied the needle or the spinning wheel, while Mistress Tyringham seemed to forget her anxieties for those abroad in kindly cares for those at home. There were indeed hours and hours, especially in the dead silence of night, when dismal fears would beset them, and the whoop of the owl, or the chaunt of the whippoorwill, came full charged with all those omens ascribed to them by superstition, from long past times. But the cheerful light of morning seldom failed to assuage these gloomy forebodings, and those blessed every day duties which must be attended to, in joy or sorrow, sunshine or rain, forbade that constant, wilful [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-289.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] indulgence of care or sorrow, which is one among the many penalties we pay for what is called the good fortune of being in a situation that places us above the necessity of exertion. Busy men, especially politicians, and philanthropists by profession, with whom meddling is a disease, are a mischievous race, and a great portion of their time is spent in doing mischief. But little busy bee, woman, is always gathering honey, when employed within doors. Every stitch of the needle, and every turn of the spinning wheel, administers to the comfort of somebody; and every step she takes is on some errand of domestic benevolence, tending towards a happy household, provided always that she avoids scolding, and the chimney does not smoke. All would have gone on smoothly---for the anxious cares and sad solicitude of the faithful wives and pious daughters were too deep to ruffle the surface--- had it not been for Master Gregory Moth, who being a man of notorious valor was left at home for the protection of the ladies. There had grown up between this worthy and dame Mildred, the faithful handmaid of Susan, a desperate sectarian feud, arising from a difference in politics and religion, similar to that of their masters---and according to the old saying, "like master like man," they kept up a perpetual warfare. Gregory, being an Oxford man, considered a bishop as essential to the Protestant Church as a pope is to the Catholic, and would as soon have turned Turk as give up the hierarchy. Mildred, on the other hand, never called the bishops anything but "wolves in sheep's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-290.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] clothing," and verily believed the mitre a device of Satan himself. As to the principles of the two sects, or the points of doctrine in which they differed, they knew little or nothing and cared less. Mildred was in the abstract an excellent woman; practically she had some faults, and many weaknesses. The great enemy of woman, who figured in the garden of Eden, had persuaded her, that though not young, she was still rather handsome, and she had lived so long in the hope of finding a helpmate, that hope had almost become a certainty. The vision had become so familiar that it seemed actual reality. She was, moreover, violently given to psalm singing, both in season and out of season, though it must be confessed her voice did not quite equal the music of the spheres, as celebrated by the rascally Pagan bards. The fact is, it was decidedly bad, inasmuch as it united the two great requisites of shrillness and dissonance, besides being occasionally as keen as hard cider. It was, moreover, a most ungovernable and rebellious voice, always out of the traces; sometimes too high, at others too low, and continually breaking short off, from a treble to a bass, without the slightest preliminary gradation, like unto a desperately-ridden hack, who suddenly varies his pace from a canter to a trot, from a trot to a villanous wriggle, and finally ends in a full stop. In addition to all this, poor Goody Mildred sung through the nose, and made ugly wry faces just like a prima donna. Gregory Moth, who boasted of being not only an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-291.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] Oxford scholar, but a Cavalier, had a special antipathy to long psalms, most especially the one hundred and nineteenth, a great favorite of Mildred. If, as the most witty of all wits, the reverend author of Hudibras, affirms, in the mischievous spirit of satire, the Puritans were pious out of pure spite to the Cavaliers, it may be affirmed with equal truth, that the Cavaliers were licentious and profane in pure spite to the Puritans. There was a curious contest---on one side which should be the best, on the other which should be the worst. However this may be, the feud which deluged a nation with blood, and cost a monarch his head, had somehow or other descended into Mistress Tyringham's kitchen, and greatly disturbed its accustomed serenity. These two bulwarks of the faith scarcely ever met without a sparring, and, if the truth must be told, Master Gregory often provoked a contest, from which he always came off triumphant by preserving his temper. His usual way of rousing the lion was by singing a stave of some profane song, and calling her Goody Mildred, a name she abhorred. A day or two after the departure of the expedition against the savages, Mildred was sitting in deep contemplation of the enormities of the wolves in sheep's clothing, and at the same time humming a stave, which from long habit she could repeat without thinking. At this moment Gregory approached her with fell designs, singing a verse of an old song, to which she had a special aversion, and which ran thus--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-292.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] "Barnaby, Barnaby, thou 'st been drinking, I can tell by thy nose, and thine eyes are winking; Drunk at Richmond, drunk at Dover, Drunk at Newcastle, drunk all over, Hey Barnaby! take 't for warning, Be no more drunk or dry of a morning." "Goody Mildred, I wish you would take a lesson from me in singing, for you know I was one of the chaunters at Saint Frydeswide's church, at Oxford. I never heard an owl hoot with a worse grace. Listen to me, I'll teach you the true cadenza:" and he roared out--- "My name's not Tribulation, Nor holy Ananias; But I'm a pagan saint of old, Call'd Antoninus Pius." "What dog is that, howling?" exclaimed Mildred. "Get out, you cur;" and she stamped her foot significantly. "Goody Mildred, of a truth, thou hast little taste and no voice. Why, I have silenced a whole flock of wolves with that very song. If you don't like it, I'll sing you another---Fa, sol, la,---hem---my voice is a little hoarse." "Hoarse!" said the other; "it's always hoarse. It sounds for all the world like the songs they sing in Tophet. I wish you'd go and frighten the wolves again." "Well, but Goody Mildred---excellent, exemplary Mildred---don't be so Crop-earish; and don't turn up [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-293.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] your devout, impatient nose at me, as if I was a bishop. I've a great secret to tell you." "Well, what is it? do tell me." Mildred was apt to be a little curious. "Why, marry, I declare I am almost afraid to tell you, for I might as well expect a drum to keep a secret. But, really now, as it were, peradventure, and howbeit, if I am not greatly mistaken in the symptoms, I am either grievously in love, or at least have an awful presentiment that I shall soon meet with one of those fatal accidents called matrimony, and that without benefit of clergy." "Oh, Master Gregory! not without benefit of clergy; that would be monstrous wicked. But you are at your nonsense again. I know you are not serious." "Serious and solemn as a toad sitting under his umbrella, which is metaphorically called his stool. Am not I a Cavalier, and you know they never tell fibs like unto the Crop-ears." "I don't know any such thing, old Moth," so she always called him when out of humor. "Well, don't be angry, it spoils your looks entirely, and that is a great pity, seeing you can't well afford it. So you won't hear my secret?" "Well, out with it. I'm sure I don't hinder you." "As I was saying---no, now I recollect, I have not yet said it---I am grievously tempted, whether in the flesh or in the spirit, I know not---whether instigated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-294.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] by the wicked Serpent or not, to commit the awful, unpardonable, irrevocable sin of matrimony." "Now, you don't say so, Master Gregory. You mean, then, to reform and marry." "No, I mean to marry and reform---that is the true order of succession. To reform before marrying is putting the cart before the horse; for, inasmuch as that all men undergo a radical change after marriage, if they were to wax good beforehand, ten to one they would revolt afterwards and become little better than the wicked. But, to return to my text:---I have deeply pondered the subject for the last thirty years, and if I could meet with a real bona-fide woman--- I mean a white woman, who has brought her pigs to the same market,---'Slife, Mistress Mildred, I think I would purchase one of the plantations over yonder, that have no owners---for I have saved a little, skimmed the cream---eh! Mistress Mildred---you understand?" and Master Gregory slapped his pocket, where he always carried a few pennies to make a jingling. "Are you really serious?" asked Mildred, edging her chair close to him. "Quite serious, by all---but I won't swear. You wouldn't like a swearing husband, would you?" "Husband? Good la! Master Gregory, I never think of such a thing. But I would exhort him at all hours, by day and by night, sleeping or waking, eating or drinking, to give up the practice; and if he refused---" "You'd convert him with a broomstick---hey?

But to proceed---I have had serious, nay, insurmountable difficulties in finding a suitable person; for, you know, women are as scarce here as swallows in winter. I have---forgive my presumption, most exalted of women---I have all but determined to cast myself and fortune at your feet," and down he plumped on his knees. "La! Master Gregory, now you are making game of me, I can see it in your eyes." "Distrust thy spectacles, divine spinster. Mine eyes lie most impudently, if they convey any such diabolical insinuations. In good faith, were it not for one thing---" "What is that?" cried Mildred, impatiently. "Why, verily it is this---I will be candid with you, for I scorn to deceive your unsuspecting innocence. The fact is, you damsels of a certain age are too apt to boast of your conquests; you go about like a hen, cackling as if you had performed a great feat, and wanted all the world to know it. Now, I am a modest man, possessed of all the delicacy of my sex, and don't like to be published in this manner. If it were not for this serious objection, I do verily believe, I should be tempted to offer Mistress Habingdon a few pounds of tobacco, for the rich reversion of your remaining years, seeing that in all probability you would break my heart by dying a martyr, to prevent me from hanging myself in despair." Towards the close of this aboriginal declaration, Goody Mildred had gradually pushed her chair farther [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-296.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] and farther from Gregory, who sat with immovable gravity waiting an answer, which came like a hailstorm. "Marry come up!" cried she, in a rage. " You talk of marrying--- you talk of buying a plantation, that can't muster as much as the hundredth part of a fathom of wampum. You miserable bag of bones--- you smoked herring, that has hung up so long in the chimney that rats won't touch it. You dried toadstool. You---you---you--- I boast of such a conquest--- I cackle like an old hen! You an Oxford scholar, that never studied anything but how to make a ninny of yourself. You a Cavalier--- you pretend to have kept company with gentlemen in London, that never entered a decent house but to steal cheese-parings, and never drank anything but two-penny ale, which you never paid for, at the sign of the fool laughing at a feather! But I can't live in the same house any longer, and I'll go tell my mistress so, this blessed minute." "Go say thy prayers, good Mildred, and aggravate thine apathy," said Gregory, and Mildred departed in a rage. These sparrings happened almost daily, and invariably ended in an appeal to her mistress, on the part of Mildred. This placed Susan in an awkward position, somewhat similar to an exiled monarch, who has taken refuge with one of his more fortunate neighbors, and, if he is wise, never meddles with his domestic concerns, lest he should wear out his welcome, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-297.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] receive a hint to mind his own business. The world without, it is said, cannot bear two suns, neither can the domestic world within doors bear a divided empire. In that sphere the system of government should be absolute, and the administration an unit. No division of power is admissible; and the lordly garment which has been from time immemorial the emblem of man's supremacy, should always be hung up at the outside of the door to indicate a temporary abdication. The discreet Mistress Habingdon was well aware of the extreme delicacy of any interference with the affairs of the domestic empire, and especially with the conduct of those household menials who exercise the important functions of ladies of honor, gentlemen ushers, lords of the bedchamber, and grooms of the stole, in the courts of puissant monarchs. Thus, though these frequent complaints of Mildred were not only disagreeable but painful, still Susan wisely declined any interference, awaiting with patience the completion of the temporary building preparing for their reception, until a better was finished. By persevering in this prudent course of non-intervention, it actually happened that the two ladies, though placed in this dangerous juxta-position, preserved the most amicable relations, and finally parted the best friends in the world. Other than these summer squalls, there was nothing to disturb the even tenor of their daily routine, except continued fears and anxieties, which were much oftener felt than expressed. Nearly four weeks had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-298.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] elapsed, without any tidings of their absent friends, save certain vague rumors coming from no one knew where, which only increased their apprehensions. Buried in the boundless, pathless wilderness, these hardy adventurers were lost to the world, and had no means of giving or receiving information. Both parties remained entirely ignorant of the fate of each other. But the two matrons had been accustomed to these trials, which, without hardening their hearts, had given them firmness to endure either actual or anticipated evils. Poor little Miriam suffered most, for she had not been so well schooled in the rough discipline of the world, and besides anxiety for her father, had now begun to cherish in secret, and unknown to herself, another feeling, which sometimes overmasters filial love. Notwithstanding the simplicity and self-denial which formed the basis of her character, she resembled her father in the depth of his enthusiasm, and the firmness of his resolution. She was capable---nay, she was formed for cherishing the most profound and lasting impressions; and in the misty softness that seemed to constitute the leading feature of her mind, as it certainly formed its most touching attraction, there was sleeping, as it were, a steady, calm resolution, which, when once formed, and sanctioned by a conviction of right, was capable of resisting temptation, danger, violence and death. Her virtues had grown up and been nourished in the solitude of youth, and like the giants of the primeval forest, acquired a strength and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-299.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] maturity never to be equalled by any after growth. Had she been wicked, she would have been a monster; had time and circumstance concurred, she might have become a saint or a martyr, like those illustrious virgins whose pure blood cemented the grand edifice of the Christian Church. But in her present situation she seemed far removed from such a destiny. Save piety and filial love, no other strong feeling had ever agitated her bosom, until she had frequent opportunities of meeting Langley Tyringham, who stood before her all alone, a tall, stately tree in some sandy desert, without a companion, and without a rival. There was no one near to compare with him, and the great solitude around seemed, in her gentle fancy, animated by him alone. She was not actually in love, or did not know if she was. She had lately thought a great deal of Langley, especially since his wound and his absence on such a perilous adventure, for he accompanied her father, and they were so closely associated in peril that it was quite impossible to dwell on one without recalling the other. But he had never spoke a word of love to her, though sometimes her heart would whisper sweetly in her ear, that once or twice at least the tongueless eloquence of his eyes had flashed a language more easily learned than our mother tongue, and far more expressive than that of the flowers by which the Persian youth conveys his secret love. The time did indeed pass wearily, sometimes sadly, with the lonely girl, and every day she found it more difficult to fix her mind on the objects before her. It [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-300.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] wandered away into the region of ideal fancies and visionary anticipations, half shaped, and peering like objects in a mist, half real, half a dream. Even her devotions were often intruded on by worldly thoughts, and anticipations that flitted past and led her away into the wilderness; or, what was far more winsome and alluring, into a region of dim visionary delights such as are never realized in this world. She often wandered along the river, careless of its smiling banks or tuneful murmurs; and still oftener sat idle at her wheel, until roused by catching the eyes of her mother contemplating her with deep solicitude. Ah! Miriam, thou hast a secret in that innocent bosom, and remember what the poet sings: "If, when within the budding rose A gnawing worm in secret lies, Unless the opening leaves disclose The thief, the flower soon fades and dies." Return from the Wars---the Cavalier and Roundhead like Each Other the Less the Better They Become Acquainted---Specific for Dispersing a Fog---A Communication Ending with Something like a Declaration. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-301.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] One evening, as the three Penelopes were sitting together, beguiling the time in sober chat and sober occupation, they were suddenly roused by the entrance of those who were the subject of their thoughts and conversation. It is unnecessary to describe the warm, affectionate welcome they received, or repeat the thousand eager questions dictated by curiosity or a deeper interest, and which, contrary to the practice of many lords of creation, were answered with exemplary courtesy. All manner of married men should make a point, when they return home from the daily round of occupation or pleasure, to answer the inquiries of their helpmates frankly and fully. They should recollect, that women are household deities, who only see what is passing in the world through the windows, and are, consequently, more curious than the other sex. Nor should they forget, that they have a right to know what their husbands have been about during their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-302.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] absence. Who knows but that they may have been carousing it lustily at a tavern, losing money at a horse race, figuring among the young ladies, or, what is still more provoking, actually making love to a fashionable dame just returned from the land of Cicisbeos. Yet we have seen brutes of husbands who, returning home from fishing or hunting excursions, would churlishly make a mystery of how many fish they had caught, or woodcocks they had shot or missed. This we affirm to be treason against the domestic queen; but, like bigamy, it never fails to carry its own punishment with it, as all men of experience know full well. If not a storm, there will be a cloudy day after it, as sure as the world. But a vehement and never-ceasing desire to render our work highly instructive to all classes of readers, we fear may draw upon us the indignation of some and set the others yawning. It can't be helped. We must have our say, and those who don't like it may solace themselves with cheap literature and picture books. We have said nothing of the meeting of Miriam and Langley, for the special reason that there was nothing to say. Their behavior was exceedingly provoking. Miriam only held out her hand timidly, and Langley, as he gently pressed her finger ends, softly whispered, "You see I have taken good care of myself." The little goosecap blushed, for she remembered these were the last words she had spoken to him on his departure. But there is no time for love scenes just now. We [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-303.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] have a new house on our hands, and must finish it as soon as possible. So at least thought Harold Habingdon, the Roundhead, who became every day more impatient to remove from the domicile of the Cavalier, that never said grace at meals, and ate a hot dinner on a Sunday. The fact is, the more these two gentlemen saw, the less they liked each other. Though both good men in their way, they were continually ruffling each other, without intending or knowing it. Like two burrs, they never came in contact without pricking. It was not only a contrast of opinion on those ticklish subjects, politics and religion, but their medium of viewing almost everything, as well as their habits and manners, not only forbade anything like cordiality, but actually created a mutual dislike. The Roundhead abhorred drinking, even to tetotalism, and blasphemed against tobacco. If asked to take a glass of wine, he declined, with an air of scornful superiority, which almost amounted to insult. It happened that just at this time the classical beverage called mint-julep was invented by some happy genius, whose name, according to custom, with most of the great benefactors of mankind, has been ungratefully forgotten. The inventor of the plough is unknown, while he of the daguerreotype, who has been the instrument of marring more human faces than all the sign painters that ever existed, hath been embalmed in divers works that will cause his name to last at least as long as themselves. Well might the sage [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-304.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] Gregory Moth liken fame unto water, which floats the feather and lets the diamond sink to the bottom. The old Cavalier was in truth a man egregiously inclined to be jovial, though, to do him justice, he never got "foxed," as the phrase then was, except on extraordinary occasions, such as birthdays, holidays, election days, and friendly carousals among the chosen few. If ever man had a fair excuse for sailing over the Bay, it was him; for the juice of the grape and the juleps did so harmonize with his good qualities, that he was, if possible, thrice as kindhearted, forgiving, generous, and loving in his cups, as when sober as a deacon. With him the love of good wine was a prelude to the love of his neighbor, not excepting the Roundhead, whose name he sometimes toasted, when the wine or the venison was especially good, with the remark, that "though a Crop-ear, he was as honest as the day, and as brave as Caesar, that is to say, on particular occasions." But he always relapsed when he became sober, and hated him mortally, a fact we relate unwillingly, because it may be that evil-disposed persons may draw from it an argument in favor of drinking. Touching mint juleps, it is confidently asserted, that he was the first man that achieved "a hail storm," by the aid of which he boasted he could at any time disperse a great fog, and thus escape a fit of the ague. It was with him an incontrovertible axiom, that any man who would not volunteer a fit of the gout now and then, for the sake of good fellowship, was a skinflint, a flincher, and a milksop to boot. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-305.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] Finally, he was a devoted disciple of Sir Walter Raleigh---glory to his name!---and smoked like an aboriginal; was mighty quick on the trigger; exceedingly loyal, though he eschewed passive obedience; rigidly orthodox, in his way; and swore a little upon occasion. The Roundhead, it is well known, was neither loyal nor orthodox, and agreed with King James in nothing but his disloyalty to tobacco. He never fell into a passion---that is, he never gave vent to it openly. He rejected wine on principle; he despised tobacco on principle; and in short, was fettered by so many principles, that on the whole, though a man of real worth he was a disagreeable companion, since he was not content with abstaining himself and setting a good example, but lectured others for not following it. With these, and various other sharp points of contact, it is no wonder that these two neighbors, when the time came for Harold to take possession of his new house, parted worse friends than they had met; the crowning offence being given by that gentleman, in discovering what the Cavalier considered an indecent anxiety to quit his house as soon as possible. They verified the old observation, that domestic association creates either friends or enemies. The story goes, that two men once retired into the wilderness to make maple sugar. They occupied a large hollow tree, and there was not another human being within a distance of twenty miles. They agreed very well at first, but soon fell to quarreling, and one of them finally [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-306.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] murdered the other. So, when there was but one family on the face of the earth, a brother slew his brother in a religious quarrel. Let us not boast too much of poor human nature. After allowing a few days for putting things in order in the new habitation, Langley Tyringham, considering, or choosing to consider, the old prohibition of intercourse abrogated, or superseded by the two families having not only resided together in peace, but made war as allies, strolled over one evening to make a friendly visit of inquiry, and offer his services. Entering without ceremony, as the door stood wide open, he found Miriam sitting alone, apparently perfectly idle---for it was just at that happy hour of twilight, when all the world has leave to play awhile--- indulging a sort of indolent reverie, in which fancy hovers like the butterfly from flower to flower without lighting on any. She started at his entrance, and though he was received not unkindly, her deportment evinced a degree of awkward restraint, that seemed to say he was not altogether welcome. But soon her habitual calm self-possession returned, and after a few minutes conversation on past events, she addressed him with a melancholy gentleness, and her eyes cast down--- "Langley Tyringham, I have all my life been accustomed to obey the commands of my father, nor will I wilfully disobey them but when my own reason and conscience forbid my obedience." Here she paused, as if to take breath, or gather firmness to proceed, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-307.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] Langley thought to himself, "What is coming now?" She drew a long breath, that seemed almost a sigh, and then with an effort at cheerfulness proceeded--- "I see thou art a patient listener, and will be as brief as possible to reward thee. Dost thou remember the conversation we had together, walking along the river side?" "Certainly I do. It has often been recalled to mind, and I almost think I could repeat every word." "Thou rememberest, too, the commands of our--- of your father and mine, that we---that is, that thou shouldst not seek me again; that we were to hold no converse, and be as strangers to each other?" "I do; but don't you know these commands are, or should be, no longer in force. Have we not lived together, shared dangers together, suffered and rejoiced together, since that time? Surely our fathers can be no longer enemies after having been thus closely associated with each other, when all their earthly interests were bound up together. I feel myself free to come and go, unless you forbid me. If my visits give you pain, I will see you no more." "They do indeed, and---" "I am gone, then, Miriam"---said he, in a tone of sadness---"If my presence, as I understand you, is disagreeable, I will trouble you no more; for, however deeply I may regret its loss, I would not seek your society at such a price. Farewell!" "Thou---thou dost not understand me, Langley. Thy visits are not disagreeable, but painful to me, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-308.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] because they involve a breach of duty. O! were it not for that, I should"---and here she checked herself in some confusion. "What then?" asked he, eagerly. "No matter what; it is of little consequence. Let me say what I have to say. I am commissioned by my father, at my earnest request, to say to thee, that having been sheltered under the roof of thy father from danger and death---having been his guest and shared his generous hospitality, he cannot bring himself to forbid your seeing me in his own house. But he entreats thee, for reasons of the deepest moment, reasons which can never be overcome, and that become every day stronger, that---that thou wouldst spare him the painful necessity of forbidding thy visits, by voluntarily discontinuing them." "Why, what, in the name of heaven, have I done to awaken such strong antipathy? But, no matter; his wishes and yours shall be obeyed. In my father's house all are welcome, and his son is too proud to intrude where that is wanting. Farewell, Miss Habingdon; though you drive me away, I will still watch over you, and be your protector, should protection be required." "Alas! Langley, say not my wishes," replied she, sadly; "for why, now that we shall meet no more--- why should I not tell thee frankly, that but for that unhappy feeling of dislike, I might almost call it antipathy, between our fathers, it would have been a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-309.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] pleasure to me to see you here, or elsewhere. But it is forbidden, and obedience is my duty. "Miriam---Miriam---does it indeed give you no pain to think we shall meet no more?" "It does, indeed. Why should I, who have all my life considered it right to speak the truth, speak falsely now? I shall be more lonely than ever. My feelings and my thoughts will have no one to commune with, and I shall prey upon myself. I shall be sorry so see thee no more. But it must be so." There was a touching, plaintive simplicity and feeling in this frank confession of innocent regard that waked up all the latent enthusiasm of Langley's soul, and caused him to pour it forth before her, without control--- "Thanks, Miriam---dearest Miriam---a thousand thanks, of love and gratitude, for your gentle kindness. Nay, hear me before I go---hear me declare to you that I love you better than any living being---that you are dearer to my heart than all in this world besides, and that nothing on earth shall prevent your being mine but your own heart and your own will. You say you have always been accustomed to tell the truth, and I believe you. Tell me---the question imports much, and your answer more---tell me, would you, did no duty, no parental authority interfere--- would you forbid my visits after what I have now said. Think what you say, and answer frankly." Miriam reflected a few minutes, as if to realize the import of the question, and then firmly replied--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-310.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] "No---I would not!---and now farewell, Langley. I see my father coming, and your meeting would give no pleasure to either. I shall tell him all that has passed. "Do so, dear Miriam. Let us have no concealments. Our only sure guide through this world, in joy or sorrow, danger; or difficulty, is the honest truth, let what may come. Farewell once more---give me your hand. I shall watch over you at a distance, that will be something to live upon." "Farewell, Langley;" and the conceited youth thought he actually felt a gentle pressure of her fingers.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-311.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] Immediately on the return of her parents from their walk, Miriam, with that calm self-possession ever the result of a consciousness of well meaning, detailed to them all the particulars of the interview with Langley. The mother listened with somewhat painful anxiety, the father with evident disapprobation. When the daughter had concluded, he addressed her with stern solemnity, as follows--- "Miriam---you know I always act on principle---I feared, nay, I foresaw this, and for that reason forbade all intercourse with that profane young man, who would doubtless lead thee to the path of destruction. He is one of the followers of Belial, and were he to become thy guide in this world would shipwreck thy hopes of that which is to come. Tell me---I know [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-312.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] thou wilt speak the truth, even on a subject where maidens think it seemly to deceive even their parents--- tell me, hast this young Philistine touched thy heart? Come, do not blush and hang thy head. Remember, I am thy father, and thy mother is a woman." Miriam did indeed blush and hang her head, and hesitated before she answered--- "Father, I know not what thou meanest by touching the heart; but if to think often, and sometimes dream of him---if to wish for his presence and regret his absence---if to feel myself awakened to a new existence, and to live and move in a world I never dreamed of before, is to be touched at the heart, then, I fear, I am indeed touch deeply." "Enough---enough, my daughter," said Susan; "thou remindest me of the days of my youth. I recognize thy symptoms---say no more." "Miriam," spoke Harold, after a silence of deep, intense thought, "listen to what I am about to say. The young man hath disclosed his love to thee, and thou hast sufficiently disclosed thine to thy parents. Thy innocent heart is indeed deeply touched, as I well can see. Providence, for some inscrutible purpose, perhaps to try thee in the fire, hath baffled all my precautions. As a father I have a right to forbid thee to think more of that reprobate young man." "Reprobate!" exclaimed Miriam, timidly. "For aught I have ever seen of him, he is good and amiable, honest and true." "It may be so in the estimation of those who judge [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-313.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] a man by his acts rather than his faith, and substitute the filthy rags of good works for the sublime mysteries of the incomprehensible Creator. But whatever he may be, he is not of thy faith, nor are his habits, manners, and mode of thinking like ours. He belongs to a church which hath persecuted thy father and thy mother; to a party which hath forced them into exile from their country, whose principles are in eternal warfare with mine and thine, and to whose members our habits and principles are subjects of ridicule, if not abhorrence. To live in harmony with such a man under one roof, and in all the intimate relations of life, either thou must assimilate with him, or he with thee. In the natural, not to say inevitable course of things, the former would be the case; the weaker vessel would yield, and thou wouldst become not only a backslider from thy faith, but its deadly foe. All that I have done and suffered in the hope of at last enjoying the freedom of my immortal soul, and transmitting the like to my children to the latest posterity, will thus be rendered vain. Thou wilt become an apostate, and thy children will follow thy example." He paused, deeply affected by the picture he had drawn, and Miriam approached, took his hand, and said--- "Believe it not, my father. The persecutions of the living and the dead of my family; the blood thou hast shed of others, and thine own, and the sacrifices thou hast made, have caused thy faith to be too precious to me ever to offer it up on any worldly altar. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-314.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] Speak thy commands. I will not say I am convinced by thy arguments, but I will obey thy will." Harold kissed her pale cheek affectionately, and proceeded--- "I command nothing---I will nothing; for I now see that to do so is only to lift a feather against the wind. While I thought it might avail, I strove to prevent what has happened, as I too plainly see, by forbidding all intercourse between you. But it is done, and I will interfere no more. If Master Langley Tyringham offers thee marriage, with the approbation of his father, I leave thee to thy own free will to decide. Only remember this, Miriam; if by indulging the wishes of thine heart, thou shouldst break that of thy father; and, if in vainly reaching after happiness in this world thou should forfeit that in the world to come, the penalty will be the just meed of the offence, for thou alone wilt be to blame. Thou wilt have offered up thy soul a victim to thy heart." Overcome by this appeal, Miriam cast herself on his bosom, and sobbed out--- "Father, never while thou livest will I leave thee; never while I live will I disobey thy commands, for I know thou wilt never bid me do wrong. Be satisfied--- all is over." He pressed her to his heart, and this prompt obedience made him almost regret this harsh exertion of his authority. Susan, who had remained a silent witness of the scene, now drew her daughter away, and by her womanly sympathy calmed her into quiet resignation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-315.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] In the meantime the old Cavalier had received a full and true account of the state of his heart, and his position towards Miriam, from Langley, whose frank and manly spirit scorned all concealment. He was answered by a tremendous explosion of wrath, levelled at Crop-ears, Roundheads, Rebels and Republicans, not forgetting Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament. He denounced them all in a lump, for divers grievous offences, such as making long prayers, singing psalms through their noses, and cutting their hair in an unseemly fashion; swore they were no better than Jews, because they ate cold dinners on Sunday, and concluded, as was not unfrequently the case when the froth had subsided into sediment, with something like a sensible observation, to wit: that enthusiasm might be respectable enough in its growing state, because it was sincere; but that nothing was more contemptible than enthusiasm in its decline, since it was always replaced by hypocrisy. Master Langley, as was his invariable custom when the old gentleman indulged himself in an explosion, listened in respectful silence. But when the storm had a little subsided, he attempted to expostulate. "But consider, my dear sir---" "'Slife, sir, I won't consider. I never considered but once in my life, and then I made a great blunder. But I have no objection to hear what you have to say, though I tell you beforehand it will be of no use. Come, give us an eulogium on Crop-ears, and particularly young Crop-ear damsels." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-316.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] Just at that moment Langley, instead of duteously listening to his father, had conjured up right before him the picture of a little Crop-ear damsel, whose plain, yet touching face, graceful symmetry of form, gently waving hair, and deep, lustrous eyes, presented a most agreeable subject for contemplation. The whole vision defied Puritanism, most especially the hair, which obstinately curled, in despite of the "Platform." He could not help greeting it with a smile, which, in classic phrase, "raised the old Cavalier's dander pretty considerably." "What," cried he, "you're laughing, are you? I can tell you, though you stand there grinning, like a stone fence, its no laughing matter, sir. If you don't instantly relinquish all claim, right, title, interest, reversion, remainder, and all that sort of thing, to this little Puritan Roundhead, who rebelled against the King, put down the bishops, brought one monarch to the block, and exiled another,---I say, sir, if you don't pronounce, renounce, and denounce all intercourse in thought, word, or deed, with this witch of Endor, you're no son of mine---damme---that's all---now laugh at that, sir." "My dear father," replied Langley, who was not unaccustomed to these tornados, "I assure you I was not smiling at what you said. There was nothing in it to provoke a smile." "No, I should think not. You'll find it a serious business, I can tell you. But I insist on knowing what you were laughing at, sir." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-317.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] "I only smiled, sir; I was not laughing." "Well, sir, that's only a different degree of impertinence. What were you smiling at?" "Why, sir, I had a delightful vision---" "Bless me! a vision---the fellow is half Crop-ear already. I suppose he will begin to prophecy soon. Well, what was it, a fiend or an angel---eh?" "An angel, sir. A little Crop-eared angel, about the middle size, with a face as innocent as a dove; teeth white as snow; lips red as a cherry; a neck like a swan; a shape like Venus; hair, every thread of which might form a chain for captive hearts, and eyes in which you see reflected a bright heaven of love and purity." "By Jupiter!" exclaimed the old Cavalier, rubbing his hands, "I should like to see such a vision. It must have been an angel." "What's that you are saying about angels, my dear?" said Mistress Tyringham, at that moment coming into the room, and putting to flight the angelic vision. Now, whether this inopportune diversion in favor of Langley grated harshly on his feelings, for people don't like to be interrupted in giving lectures--- or that the abrupt dispersion of the vision produced that effect, we cannot say, but certain it is the Cavalier took it somewhat in dudgeon. Mistress Tyringham, though a woman of ten thousand, was not altogether lovely. In fact she was rather a contrast to Langley's angel. "What was I saying, my dear"---for he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-318.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] particular in always treating his wife with gentlemanly courtesy---except when he forgot it---"what was I saying about angels! Why, I was telling this young gentleman who has visions and dreams, that I would see him hanged before he should marry the Roundhead's daughter." "La! my dear, I'm sure that was not much like an angel. Why did you so earnestly wish to see one just at such a time? I declare I begin to be quite curious." "Why my dear---because---hang me if I know exactly. Langley, can't you tell me?" Langley shook his head. "Well, then, I believe it was because I see them so seldom." "Well my dear, that's a sufficient reason to satisfy a reasonable woman," and the good lady departed perfectly contented, for she liked to tease her husband a little sometimes, after the manner of all discreet wives. "Plague take the woman---no---Heaven bless the dear, good old soul"---she was only ten years younger than her husband. "Heaven bless her. But she has thrown me completely out of the traces. Where was I, Langley?" "Why sir, according to the best of my recollection, I think you were just about giving your full consent and approbation to my marriage with the little Crop-eared angel I saw in my dream, and who took your fancy so much." "Why, you impudent young scapegrace! But [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-319.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] enough of this---I am a man of few words. You know my mind, and I once more repeat, that if you marry that young Roundhead, you are no son of mine." "My dear," asked Mistress Tyringham, putting her head inside the door---"My dear, would you like to have the chickens roasted or fried for dinner? But what were you saying about Langley being no son of yours! You ought to be ashamed, my dear, of throwing out such insinuations against an honest woman." "Pshaw!" said the Cavalier testily. "Well, pshaw or no pshaw---I say you ought to be ashamed of yourself. And, Langley, as you are, it seems, relieved from all obligations of duty to your respected father, I am clearly of opinion you may go and marry Miriam Habingdon, as soon as you can gain her consent. But, my dear, you have not decided about the chickens." "'Slife, Jenny, what's got into you, to-day? What do I care---fry them, or broil them, or roast them, or boil them, in the devil's name, for all me." "Well, my dear, I suppose that means plenty of cayenne pepper. Gregory! Gregory Moth! Please go and tell Black Rose to tell Phebe to tell Phillis to put plenty of cayenne inside and out of the chickens. Her master wants them a little devilled, as he feels rather chilly this cool morning." The thermometer was at ninety. The excellent matron departed, laughing in her sleeve, contented with having made her husband a little ashamed of himself, without resorting to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-320.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] the ultima ratio regum of matrimony---arguing the question, which in nine cases out of ten, produces contention. The great secret for preserving domestic harmony is to let all parties do as they like, and if they are rational, good-tempered people, they will naturally like to please each other. If they are not so, there is no use in argument. But to return to our story. This interruption of good Mistress Tyringham again threw the Cavalier completely off the track; but he soon found it again, and repeated the sentence of disinheritance with renewed vigor. "My dear father," said Langley, "It is quite unnecessary, I have just been dismissed by the young lady, by command of her father, with strict injunctions not to visit her again." "What," cried the astonished Cavalier, "rejected--- refused---cut adrift by a Roundhead---a Crop-ear--- a rebel to his king, and a renegade from his mother church! Why 'slife, what is the meaning of all this? The son and heir of sixteen generations of Cavaliers, rejected by the daughter of a Crop-ear, and turned out of the house by a Roundhead! Here, Gregory, Gregory--- saddle old Rowley instantly. Rejected---a son of mine, only four degrees removed from a title---by Jupiter Amnon, the whole generation of Crop-ears shall answer for the insult. Langley, this makes matters ten times worse, and if you have the spirit of a man, you will implicity obey my command. You may go--- I see Gregory coming with old Rowley." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-321.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] Langley departed, just as Gregory entered, and as usual, inquired what his master wanted. On being informed of the gross insult offered to the house of Tyringham, and that he was to be the bearer of a defiance, as there was no gentleman in the neighborhood to perform that office. He demurred exceedingly, for he had an insuperable antipathy to fighting, or having anything to do with it. He insisted that the occasion by no means called for such decisive action; that the honor of the family rather required no notice should be taken of this slight; and that being so greatly opposed to the match, his master ought to be rather highly pleased than mortified, at what would place an insuperable obstacle in its way. "'Slife, Gregory, I say again for the hundredth time at least, that you are the most astonishingly discreet knave, for so great a fool, I ever met with. You talk sometimes like Friar Bacon's head, and sometimes as if you had no head at all." "Ah sir! when I take into serious consideration that it is not the fashion for wise men to speak wisely at all times, methinks it were a great pity that fools should not enjoy the like privilege. Wise fools, sir, are just as common as foolish wise men. The world is divided between them." "Gregory Moth, I pronounce you one of the seven champions---I mean one of the seven wise men of Greece, who like his sacred majesty, King Charles, according to that villain Rochester, never said a foolish thing nor ever did a wise one. Truly, Moth, if [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-322.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] your valor were only proportioned to your wisdom, you would be as great a wonder---as---as---zounds! I was never good at a comparison." "You mean, doubtless, sir, to say, that my valor is as disproportioned to my discretion, as your discretion is to your valor. Surely, never master and man were so well fitted. You will defend me by the strength of your arm, and I will enlighten you by the thickness of my head. Thus shall we two be invincible." "Well, well---we won't dispute that matter; especially as I can always get the better of you by the argumentum ad baculinum , as we say at Oxford. I have, or to do justice, you have thought better on this subject. It would be making the Roundhead of too much consequence to call him out on such an occasion. The honor of my family is safe from such a mushroom of yesterday." The doughty Cavalier forgot that the family of Habingdon could beat him hollow counting centuries. "To be sure, sir," replied Gregory; "especially as you would have the trouble of horsewhipping him afterwards; for he would not accept your defiance. He won't fight; he has scruples of cowardice, commonly called conscientious scruples." "No, no, Gregory; to do him justice, he is no coward. He is as brave as old Noll, and quite as ready to meet danger as you are to run away from it." "I run away from danger, sir! Didn't I utterly discomfit and put to flight the barbarians when your house was sorely beleagured, and that with my single [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-323.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] arm? If you had not shut me up in the cellar---I say nothing, but the copper-colored caitiffs would not have escaped scot-free as they did, to the immortal disgrace of all Christendom." This sally put the Cavalier in high good humor, and he proceeded to consult Gregory on the subject of Langley's attachment, which he communicated as a great secret. "I knew it long ago, sir," said Gregory. "You! ah---I know---you are always wiser than other people, especially in knowing things after they have come to pass. How did you know it, pray?" "Why, sir, he once threatened to crop my ears for calling the young lady a Crop-ear; and I clearly discerned from this, and other infallible symptoms, that my young master had been converted by the gospel of eyes." "Well, what do you advise me to do?" "Nothing, sir; when King Brute and his valiant Trojans---" "D---n King Brute and his valiant Trojans; what have they to do with this matter?" "O, a great deal, sir. Had they not come to England, the great university of Oxford, whose learning is heaped up like sand, and is equally productive, would probably have never existed, at least on that identical spot,; and the church and the bishops might, for aught I know, have given place to such cattle as presbyters and conventions instead of councils and convocations. Think of that, sir." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-324.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] "Certainly, all this is highly interesting; but just now I want your counsel on other matters. What do you advise me to do with Langley?" "Nothing, sir; let things alone. Love is like a brush heap on fire; the more you stir it, the more sparks and flames. Let it alone, and it will burn out of itself. See you not, sir, that the fire always advances against the wind?" "Well, I believe I'll take your advice. But, harkee, Gregory, if it turns out badly, I'll make an example of you." "You can't have a better, sir," answered Gregory, conceitedly; and the old Cavalier departed to dress for dinner, a custom he always observed, being resolved, he said, to be a gentleman one half the day, at all events. A Little Truth, by Way of a Treat---Causes and Consequences--- Harold Transgresses the Law by Obeying the Gospel---Inconvenience of being a Justice of the Peace---The Justice Seeks Counsel from a Wise Fool, like the Illustrious Panurge---Harold once more before a Magistrate---Is Fined and Adopts an Important Resolution--- Soliloquy of the Justice, which Begins very sensibly, but Ends in Nothing. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-325.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] The people of the colony of Virginia was at this period both loyal and orthodox; for though they made very little ceremony in opposing the shadow of the king in the person of his puissant governor, they reverenced the substance in the person of his master. It was, as everybody knows, originally settled by Cavaliers, roystering younger sons, victims to the firstborn of Egypt, who sought the New World to better their fortunes, or it may be from pure love of adventure, and brought with them the habits as well as principles of loyalty to church and state. The former they retained for several generations, but the latter soon became greatly modified by the irresistible influence of the free air they breathed, and the vast space occupied by the individual man, which instilled into him a deep consciousness of his own personal importance, as well as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-326.jpg) \- external link  - Blank Page. ] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-327.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] sought refuge from the persecutions of those whom persecution had taught to persecute, among the people of the South, they having no other refuge, as Pennsylvania was then a pathless wilderness. Without meaning to offer the slightest apology for religious persecution, that indelible stain on the white surplice of Christianity---it may be remarked, that it is not always the persecuted are innocent of all offence, save a difference of opinion. Zeal and enthusiasm are seldom content with mere toleration and the passive enjoyment of impunity. Instead of quietly hoarding what they already possess, they not only seek to make converts from other sects, but are prone to denounce all creeds but their own, without mercy, and without measure. It will also, in most, perhaps all cases, be found that innovations in religion necessarily involve innovations in civil governments, by interfering with long established maxims of law, as well as long existing social institutions. To these causes we may, beyond doubt, trace much of the persecution for which religious opinions were made the pretext, but which were in a great measure owing to that connection between church and state, which, wherever it has existed, has converted the trumpet of Zion into a signal for discord and bloodshed, and the gospel of peace into a bone of contention for ambition and avarice. There is perhaps another key to the persecutions of the Quakers. By the early laws of New England and Virginia, every able-bodied man was obliged to bear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-328.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] arms in the public defence. This was indispensable to the very existence of these colonies for a long time after their establishment; and the Quakers by refusing to perform the highest duty of the citizen---that of defending the State---not only rendered themselves liable to the penalties of the law, but set an example which, had it been extensively followed, would have rendered all the early colonies an easy prey to the savages. That a sect which obstinately refused to contribute to the defence of a community in whose safety they participated, and in whose advantages they determined to partake, should have been unwelcome visitors, ought not to be matter of surprise, nor can it be justly charged against those who were perpetually risking their lives for the protection of those who refused to protect themselves or others. Undoubtedly bigotry had something to do in the business, and dropt her venom into the cup of bitterness. But there were faults on both sides, and the best lesson to be derived from the history of those times is that of universal forbearance. Some two or three of these wandering exiles had found their way to Virginia, which was yet smarting under the tomahawk and scalping knife, and to whose surviving colonists their tenets could not fail of being peculiarly obnoxious, as impairing the great obligation of self-defence. They were completely under the dominion of enthusiasm, or more properly, fanaticism--- for persecution, if it does not find, always makes fanatics, and very soon attracted the attention of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-329.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] civil authorities by attempting to make converts, as well as by disturbing the service of the Established Church. Sentence of banishment was passed on them; but they refused to depart voluntarily and resisted force. They became, in short, a species of outcasts, wandering about without a home, and often without a refuge. It happened that one of these forlorn fugitives arrived at the dwelling of Harold Habingdon in a most destitute condition, half crazed with fatigue, hunger, and fanaticism. He was received with kindness, as a fellow-creature in distress, though Harold bitterly abhorred his tenets, and remained some days before he recovered sufficiently to resume his erratic career. Some one of those petty officials, the pestilenal product of penal laws, and every other species of misrule, who always outstrip their betters, in zeal for a bad cause---becoming acquainted with this affair, laid an information before the old Cavalier, against Harold, for harboring, comforting, and relieving a sinner against the statute in such case made and provided. Master Justice Tyringham was excessively annoyed at this proceeding. As a magistrate, it was his duty to enforce the laws; but though he utterly eschewed the Roundhead, and would have fought him with all his heart, still, as a neighbor he could not reconcile it to his feelings to proceed against him. They had, it is true, crossed their swords in the civil wars; but they had since stood side by side under his own roof, mutually defending each other. "Confound the Crop-ear," muttered he to himself--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-330.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] "what right has he to place me in this predicament? I must either violate my oath as a magistrate, or my conscience by doing an ill-office to my neighbor, who, though a rebel and a Roundhead, is a brave man and a good soldier, I will say that for him; though how a fellow that neither drinks nor swears can be either one or the other is beyond my comprehension." At the end of this monologue, he called in the aid of Master Gregory, who acted as his clerk on all official occasions, and handing him the information, asked--- "what shall I do in this confounded business, Moth?" "Why sir," answered Gregory, after due consideration--- "If I were you---that is to say, if you were me--- you would first give notice to Master Habingdon, that he might get out of the way, and then issue a warrant to apprehend him." "He get out of the way? He'd see me hanged first. He won't stir a peg. Your genuine Crop-ear can no more live without a dose of wholesome persecution now and then than a fowl without gravel. It keeps up his bristles, and makes his orthodoxy as stiff as a poker. No, no---that won't do, Gregory. If there was another New World he might seek refuge there; but, take my word, he won't budge an inch." "That being the case, sir, if I were in your place--- I mean, if you were in my place, you would do a good action for once in your life." "Why, you insolent varlet, do you dare to insinuate that I never did a good action?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-331.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] "You misunderstand me altogether, Justice Tyringham. Do not you comprehend that I am speaking as it were of myself, seeing I have taken the liberty of putting my own proper person in place of your own proper person---ergo, logically speaking, it is I that never did a good act, not you, my most honored master." "Well, well---go on in your own way." "As I was saying---or rather, to speak more accurately, as I was about to say---I would respectfully recommend that you perpetrate, as it were, a good deed, by flying in the face of the law, and acting according to the gospel, by doing unto your neighbor as you would be done by. It is not seemly in one of your station to pay attention to a rascally informer, who I hereby strenuously advise you to fine and imprison in place of Master Habingdon, who, though I hate as a Roundhead, I somehow or other respect, against my conscience." "It won't do---I tell you it won't do, Gregory. This good act, as you call it, will lead to the loss of mine office; and what is far worse, the disgrace of my person and character. 'Slife, sir, I should go near to be taken for a Roundhead, or a Quaker, which last I most especially abhor, because they will not fight either in a good cause or a bad one." "Well, Master Justice, that is the very thing. A good act that costs a man nothing is worth just what it costs. It is like unto a beggar's dinner for which he pays no reckoning, and is no better than scraps and bones. Besides, sir, admitting that this one neighborly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-332.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] act should be attended by evil consequences to yourself, you have only to perform ninety-nine more, and I will venture to predict, that one out of the hundred will repay you for all the rest." "By Saint Gregory the Great, your remarks are theoretically right, but, what is very provoking, practically wrong. My oath of office, Gregory Moth---my public duties as a magistrate, and all that sort of thing---don't you see I am acting double, as it were, and am pulled two different ways between a choice of evils? But it don't signify talking, I must have the Crop-ear up, and fine him according to the statute. If he won't pay, as I take for granted will be the case, for he is as obstinate as a mule, and always acts on principle, why he may go to the devil, that's all; for you know there is no jail nearer than the capital, and I shall get rid of this confounded business. Make out the warrant, and I'll dub you a constable to execute it; so that eternal busybody, who has given me all this trouble, will be despoiled of his fees." Gregory obeyed orders; the warrant was signed, and the old Cavalier dubbed him a constable by laying his cane across his shoulders. Proceeding on his mission, and finding the culprit at home, he performed his duty agreeably to the instructions of his master, in the most approved as well as courteous style, informing him that Master Justice Tyringham was unwillingly enforcing the law, as a magistrate. This proceeding caused great consternation in the minds of the Roundhead's wife and daughter, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-333.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] former of whom still preserved a vivid recollection of the persecutions of her parents, and her own sufferings in the days of her youth. She was struck with grief and dismay at what she believed a renewal of them in the New World, whither they had fled to avoid them. She pictured to herself the long catalogue of imprisonments, scoffs, stripes, and maimings which had marked the footsteps of the demon of spiritual pride; and, ignorant of the colonial law, as well as the somewhat milder spirit with which it was administered, looked forward to seeing Harold return marked with ignominious stripes, or possibly without his ears. Poor Miriam, too, bowed under the infliction, which weighed the more heavily as coming from the father of one who, she felt, was every day becoming more dear to her heart and her imagination. She was now compelled to associate him with the persecutors of her father, and her fair yet gentle spirit rose in unsuccessful revolt against the feelings of her heart. As Harold was preparing to obey the summons, both wife and daughter hung about his neck, beseeching for permission to accompany him and share his fate. But he resolutely declined, while he comforted them, saying--- "Be not cast down, my beloved. I am not afraid, though I little thought that persecution would track me, like a bloodhound, into the forests of the New World. But be of good comfort; if I understand the law, the utmost that can be inflicted is a fine, and, in default of payment, a prison. Is it not so, Master Moth?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-334.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] Gregory signified assent, and Harold, mounting his steed, accompanied him to the seat of justice. The old Cavalier, who saw them coming, felt more like a criminal than a magistrate; but, by a great rally, mustered sufficient dignity to receive him with the stiff solemnity of a citizen in office. He began by apologizing, which was cut short by Harold, who interrupted him, saying--- "There is no necessity, Master Tyringham, for apology. You are a magistrate, and must do your duty. The law is the tyrant, not those who enforce it." "Hush," answered the Cavalier, "remember that respect is due to the laws, which should be reverenced as well as obeyed." "I know no difference, sir, between the oppressions of the law and the tyranny of a single despotic will But enough on this point. May I ask of what offence I am accused?" "That of aiding, comforting, and consorting with one who has been banished from the colony for flying in the face of the law and the gospel. Here is the witness." "My offence requires no witness. I acknowledge it, without scruple and without compunction. There came a wretched man to my door, weak, hungry, and almost naked. I did not ask him his creed, nor did I inquire whence he came, or whither he was going. I saw he was a man, and that he wanted succor, for his face was pale and thin, and his limbs trembled [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-335.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] as he stood leaning on his staff. I received him into my house, for he was an outcast from all others, and I and mine administered to his necessities till he recovered and went his way. I saw that his faith was neither mine nor thine, but it seemed to me that was no reason why he should perish, like a beast of the field, in the midst of Christian men and fellow-creatures. I have suffered persecution, and God forbid I should ever inflict it on others." He spoke this in the sincerity of his soul, forgetting that, for some time past, he had been unconsciously acting on the same principle which dictated the law under which he was now smarting, and inflicting on two amiable beings far more severe penalties, solely on account of a difference of opinion. But all mankind are liable to these delusions, and in truth are seldom self-satisfied but when they deceive themselves. The sturdy old Cavalier winced not a little at the view of the subject presented by Harold, and was perfectly conscious that, in a like case, he himself would have done the same. He could not help acknowledging it was a hard case that a man should be punished for an act of humanity. But, at the same time, there was something in Harold's manner and appearance which so forcibly reminded him of the "preaching rascals," as he called them, who had beaten him and his brother Cavaliers so soundly at Marston Moor and Naseby, that his newly awakened feelings yielded to his ancient inveterate prejudices, and he relapsed into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-336.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] the stern, inflexible magistrate, who forgets the spirit of the law in acting up to the letter. "Master Harold Habingdon," said he, "it is not for you or I to sit in judgment on the laws of the land, but to obey them. It is true we are commanded by the Gospel to love our neighbor as ourself; but if the law says the contrary, why there is no more to be said. You have subjected yourself to fine, as well as imprisonment, in default of payment. But as the jail has been burnt by the savages the law must remit that penalty. I shall, therefore, inflict the fine, as is my duty; but whether you pay it or not is none of my business, nor shall I trouble myself on the subject. You are free, sir." Harold, however, insisted on paying the fine, and the justice and culprit separated with most ceremonious politeness, though the dislike of the former was materially increased by having been thus forced to act against his better feelings by the innocent agency of the latter; and Harold felt most keenly the conviction, that persecution and bigotry were citizens of the world, at home everywhere. On his way home, and after his return, he silently brooded awhile in the recesses of his mind, and having apparently come to a decision, called his wife and daughter, to whom he announced his determination to depart from the colony of Virginia, and seek refuge in New England. Susan received the announcement in silent acquiescence; Miriam started and turned pale, but said not a word. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-337.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] Harold, always prompt in action, proceeded, without delay, in carrying his project into execution. At this period, the intercourse between Virginia and New-England was altogether by sea, a great portion of the intervening country being, as previously stated, a howling wilderness. But intercourse of any kind was extremely rare; and though at long intervals a coasting vessel from Boston or Salem would find her way into the Chesapeake, on a voyage of speculation, yet this produced nothing like friendly or social intercourse. The old leaven of the mother country still fermented in the bosoms of the emigrants to the New World, and to this day is not altogether extinct. On inquiry, however, Harold had the good fortune to find at the capital a schooner of moderate size, bound for New England, and lost no time in making his arrangements. A man who is ready to take what he can get soon finds a purchaser; and he managed to arrange not only his domestic but money matters so speedily, that he was ready to embark before the schooner was ready to sail. Now, when the old Cavalier heard of the intention of his old neighbor, and saw his prompt preparations to carry it into effect, his heart smote him with the recollection of his enmity, and especially his late magisterial exercise of power. He felt a conviction that this latter was the immediate cause of this second exile, and fell into a train of reflection, which may be embodied in the following words: "'Slife! I wonder what is the reason people who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-338.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] call themselves Christians can't live together in peace and quiet like Christians, instead of squabbling, fighting, backbiting, and spitting at each other, like so so many crabs in a basket? Here now, are Master Habingdon and I, thrown by the vicissitudes of life into a new world, of which we may almost be said to be the sole Christian inhabitants; and yet we can't live together as friends and brothers, and why? He is a brave, upright man, and has never done a mean act since he came here, and I---'slife, I'll say that for myself--- am neither a coward, a hypocrite or a rogue, for I never turned my back on friend or foe, except at Marston Moor and Naseby. I did scamper there like a rabbit, that's certain. Yes, the bloody Crop-ears, with their infernal long prayers, and psalm singing, scattered us like chaff before the wind, and may I never eat venison again, if I forgive them. A Roundhead, is a Roundhead, old world or new, and there's an end of it. Let him go to New England, or New Guinea and welcome---joy go with him---I'm glad he is going." So the two neighbors who had lived several years in sight of the smoke of each other's chimneys, parted without bidding farewell, though the chances were a hundred to one they would never meet again. Unaccountably Perverse Conduct of Miriam---A Message by Gregory Moth, who Makes Mischief---An Evening in the South, which actually Ushers in an Apology for a Love Scene, which will, It Is feared, not altogether Satisfy the Reader, for Want of Sufficient High Seasoning---A Last Parting. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-339.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] When Miriam left the room, after hearing the resolution of her father, to bid an eternal farewell to the banks of the Powhatan, the first, perhaps the only thought that occupied her mind was, that she should never see Langley Tyringham again, and the cold thrill that shivered through her heart taught her, for the first time, how precious was the certainty of being near, though she might not see him. There was something in the idea of proximity, exquisitely soothing, just as the soft luminaries of the heavens, twinkling with reflected lustre, administer a sweet delight to the contemplative spirit, though for ever beyond its reach. We know they are there; we realize their presence; they exist to us, though all intercourse is forbidden. She was resigned to the thought of their never coming together, so long as it was possible for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-340.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] them to meet; but when an insurmountable barrier was placed between them, and all hope of its ever being removed was over, she felt a saddening gloom, such as had never come over her spirits before. It was no longer a sacrifice to filial duty, or an offering on the altar of faith, but an irresistible destiny which took away all the merit of voluntary submission. "Where is he?" thought Miriam. "Will he not come and bid me farewell! But I have forbid his coming, and he promised to obey. Yet now that I am going away, to be forever separated by stormy seas, and impassable wilds, if he disobeyed me, I think I could forgive him. I should like to see him once more, if only to tell him to forget that he ever loved me, and that I will never forget him. Surely he cannot know that we depart so soon---for I feel if I were him, I could not rest without a last farewell." These, and such reflections, were perpetually interrupted by the necessity of exertion in preparations for their departure. Yet they only returned with renewed strength, from their temporary suppression. The nearer the period of departure approached, the stronger became her anxiety to see Langley once more, as well as her conviction that she might do so without violating the spirit of her promise to her father. But she was not of a nature to rest in doubt on any point of filial duty, and one day frankly, though covered with blushes, asked permission of Harold, to send for Langley. "Miriam," said he---"wouldst thou wed this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-341.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] young man? Tell me truly, and without maidenly hypocrisy." "No father---at least not against thy will." "Then why wish to see him again?" "I scarcely know. But if he were only a common acquaintance, living as we have so long near neighbors, and having been sheltered from death under his father's roof, to go thus without taking leave would increase the pain of parting. Why then, since we are still near to each other, should we part without bidding farewell?" "Because, my daughter, it will only make your parting more painful." "No so, my father---at least not to me; and I trust not to him. I wish very much to say a few parting words to Langley." "To tell him to remember you, Miriam?" "No---to tell him to forget me. To tell him, as I would without being ashamed, that though if no insuperable obstacle interposed, I would gladly be to him what my mother is to you, yet as that is impossible, when we are far away from each other, he must think of me no more." "My dear daughter," said Harold, kindly---for his principles were prone to yield to his feelings---"you overrate your firmness, I fear. The sight of this youth for the last time will soften you to yielding acquiescence, and he will extort from you pledges you can never fulfil without disobedience to your father, and belying your faith to heaven." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-342.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] "Is there, then, more than one God, and do not he and I both believe in him? Is there more than one Saviour, and is not he equally so to both of us? But of this no more. I owe my father obedience, and the debt shall be paid. I am but a simple girl, but I so far know myself as that I feel I can sacrifice my own dearest wishes to my father and to my faith. I beseech thee, father, to let me see him once more. Mother, wilt thou not entreat for me?" Susan had been present during this dialogue, but did not interfere, for she knew it would be ill taken on the part of Harold, whose system of domestic government by no means approximated towards republicanism. She, however, answered this appeal, by saying to her husband--- "When we parted at the gate of the prison, in days long passed, I would have given much to exchange a few words with thee; and it added sorely to my sorrow at parting, that we could only take a silent farewell." This reference to former times awakened a long train of recollections in the mind of Harold, which softened his heart and relaxed his will. He at length granted the prayer of his daughter, and a message was sent to request the presence of Langley Tyringham. The servant returned with the intelligence that he had been absent for some time past at the capital on special business, and that the period of his return was quite uncertain. He received this information from Master Gregory, who being, as the reader knows, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-343.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] most inveterate joker in his way, concluded in the following words--- "They say he has gone on my master's business, but I reckon I know better. There is a young lady in the case, and I smell a wedding before long. But its a great secret, and you must promise not to tell a living soul." Gregory well knew the state of his young master's affections, but his infirmity of jesting was aided on this occasion by a long-cherished antipathy to the Crop-ears, and he felt great satisfaction in throwing a random arrow that struck deep where it fell. The bearer of the message kept his promise so far, that he only told the secret to Mildred, and the rest may easily be imagined. Miriam received the first item of this news in silent sorrow, but the latter portion caused her to turn deadly pale. "He requires no consolation from me," she thought, but gave her thoughts no tongue. The succeeding morning was destined for their departure. During the day she seemed a different being from what she had ever been before. Her habit was always that of repose and self-possession; but now she scarcely remained still for a moment. She wandered about the house, apparently without object; but it might have been noticed, that her steps always rested awhile at an open window, that looked toward the abode of Master Tyringham. Towards sunset, she told her father she wished to take a last walk on the banks of the river. He proposed to accompany her, but she [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-344.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] said she preferred going alone, and he acquiesced in her wishes. It was a scene to make one melancholy in bidding it a last farewell. The sun had just slipt behind the distant hills that rose in waving outlines above the level borders of the river, and left a flood of glory behind him in the evening sky. A range of airy and fantastic clouds sleeping quietly in the lap of Heaven skirted the horizon, never moving, but perpetually varying in shape and color, and exhibiting, in their changes, all the colors of the rainbow. The river slept in a dead calm. Not a single tiny wave broke on the white pebbled shore, and not an object moved on its surface but a little skiff, paddled by two negroes, who kept time to the homely, yet pathetic old ditty, which has for its burden "Long time ago." In the silence and distance its simple pathos was exquisitely touching; and the plagiarist mock-bird, after stilling his song and listening a while, vainly attempted to catch its plaintive melody. It was one of those scenes which, though they awaken no joyous feelings, are dear to the senses, the imagination, and the memory. When not overwhelmed with sorrow, or smarting under the lash of remorse, they seldom fail to inspire a pleasing and luxurious melancholy, divested of all painful recollections of the past, all gloomy anticipations of the future. We confess our delight in lingering about such scenes as this we have just sketched, and that we would fain inspire our readers with a taste which can at all times be so easily gratified. It is a cheap, as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-345.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] well as blameless luxury; it costs no sacrifice, and is followed by no regrets; it is one of those pleasures for which we pay nothing, in the past, the present, or the future; and in a world where every good we enjoy seems to be so dearly purchased, it is a great privilege to banquet at the feast without paying the reckoning. It is, moreover, a pleasure at all times, and everywhere within reach; and, while it appeals to the senses, is, at the same time, a step in Jacob's ladder, leading from earth to Heaven, since there is an inseparable link between the great Architect of the Universe and His glorious works. Miriam wandered on, too full of that within to notice that without; or, if it called her attention for a moment, it was only accompanied by the painful conviction she should behold it no more. There is something in this that makes parting even with what we little value more or less painful. To part for ever in this world, brings with it the certainty that we shall die before we meet again. It is a foreshadowing of death, which, though the common lot of all the living, is still a grisly spectre, clothed if not in terror, at least in dread uncertainty. We will not insult our reader by telling what Miriam was thinking about, as she paced along. If he---and more especially she---cannot divine it, let her remain in endless ignorance, and never know what it is to be crossed in love. As she proceeded thus unconsciously, she all at once distinguished footsteps behind her rapidly approaching, but, supposing them those of some one of the slaves in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-346.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] neighborhood, felt neither alarm nor curiosity. There was but one being she wished to see, and he was absent. Presently the footsteps were close at her side, and she heard a well-known voice of panting earnestness close to her ear. "Forgive me, Miriam, for once more intruding on you. But I have just returned, after a long absence--- at least long to me---and heard that you were going away to-morrow to a distant land, where I shall never see you again. You will forgive me for breaking my word." "I have nothing to forgive," answered she, in a low voice, "nor is your presence an intrusion. I was thinking of you---I wished to see you." "Me!---me, Miriam, after forbidding my presence so peremptorily, almost sternly." "Langley, at that time I could not see you without a breach of duty---without disobeying my father. I have now his permission to see you." "Is it possible, Miriam? What am I to understand from this?" "That we meet for the last time. Nay, do not interrupt me, for our time is short, and I have much to say. Once, and but once, thou saidst I was dear to thee, and I believed it. But it is past now. I have just heard, with satisfaction"---and the tear started from her eye---"that---that thou hast found one still dearer than I ever was, or ever wish to be." "I, Miriam? Who told you so?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-347.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] "A little bird," said Miriam, with a melancholy smile. "There is no truth in little birds, now that the reign of the fairies is past. I have not found---I shall never find one dearer to my heart than you. My absence was an indispensable business for my father, and I have just returned to hear you are going away to-morrow. But you say you have permission from your father to see me. Has he relented?" "Alas! no. It was through my persuasion, and that of my mother, that he consented to a parting interview. He will never relent, for he believes himself right, and nothing can move him. This is our last meeting, Langley." "Then, would to Heaven we had never met." "Say not so, Langley. To me, at least, it will be a source of melancholy pleasure to think of thee, and to know that we parted as friends. That here, as on the brink of the grave, with a gulf like that which separates time and eternity between us, we shook hands across the abyss, and bade farewell, not to forget, but to remember each other." "You, at least, will soon cease to remember me, Miriam?" "No; I am not one of those whose feelings are suddenly awakened, and as suddenly subside, nor do I forget what I cease to see. I know that thou wilt live in my memory till I am dead. Though I may mourn our separation, I can yet live upon my thoughts." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-348.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] "Thoughts," interrupted Langley, impatiently, "thoughts are shadows." "With me it is not so, Langley. My recollections of the past shall take place of my anticipations of the future. I may cease to hope, but I will not despair. I will still think thou rememberest, long after thou hast forgotten me, and this will be my consolation, that I shall never know it. My ignorance will be my happiness." There was a sad simplicity, a deep, yet sober, heartfelt seriousness in the look, tone, and manner of the little Puritan, as she thus gave utterance to the feelings of her pure heart that struck on that of Langley, entered deeply, and choked, for a moment, the utterance of his feelings, while she remained in that outward calm that far more than fiery words, or violent gestures, bespeaks the depth of the noiseless current. "Ah! Miriam," at length he said, "If I could but feel as you do---if I could wrap myself up in cold submission to the will of another, I should bear your absence more patiently. But why should we part? In family, in fortune, and in years we are suited to each other. We have been thrown together almost alone by ourselves in the wilderness, and our hearts have become as one. Why then should we part?" "My father wills it, and his will is mine. He may be severe, he may be unjust in his commands, but where is my warrant that I am right and he is wrong? He is my father; he has reared me from infancy, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-349.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] I am still dependent on him for every comfort I enjoy. It is, therefore, my duty to obey him, unless in so doing I violate a higher duty." A shade passed over Langley's brow. He did not relish this view of the subject, and his old prejudice against the Crop-ears roused up and began to growl. But it was only for a moment, and it lay down and and slept again. "Then you are content, Miriam, to give me up, and if your father commands, give yourself to another." "No," replied she, firmly, "while my heart belongs to thee, Langley, it would not only be a gross deception, but the breach of a holy vow, to promise obedience and love to another. My father has no right to command that, and if he did, I neither could nor would obey him. My duty goes no farther than not to choose against his will. He cannot choose for me. He cannot give away what I have already bestowed on another." "Miriam---Miriam---you reason only---you do not love." "Thou wrongest me, Langley. I shall love thee long after thou hast ceased to love me. We are going--- at least such is my father's intention---into a lonely region of a distant country, where I shall have few companions but my own thoughts, and little to divert them from the past. There will be nothing but silence and nature around me, and my associates will be the creations of my fancy, or my memory. Ah! if, as thou sayest, I reason coolly, it is not because I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-350.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] do not feel, but that true and lasting love is as much the offspring of reason as of passion. You accuse us Puritans of canting, but the worst cant is that which excuses the crimes and excesses of love, by placing it above the restraints of reason and virtue." "Did you wish then to see me once more, only that you might lecture me into forgetting you?" said Langley, in dissatisfaction. "No, Langley. I wished to reconcile thee to our parting. As little do I wish thee to forget me as I wish to forget thee. Why cannot we continue to love each other as well absent as present? Why cannot we be contented with thinking of each other?" "Thinking! it is only bread and water to the starving heart. But I will urge you no more. I love you too well to tempt you to disobedience, and involve myself in the same offence. Nay, I know you too well to believe I could be successful in attempting it. I know, too, that you could never be happy, or bestow happiness on me, by deserting your parents, and inflicting on your own heart the sting of ingratitude. I know that we must part, but I own I could wish to see thee a little less resigned. Oh! only seem to be miserable like me, and I will try to be content." "Langley---dear Langley, have done with these useless complaints. Do not think me devoid of feeling, because both habit and example have taught me restraint. Ah! if thou couldst see into my heart! and thou shalt see it!" exclaimed she, with a sudden burst of feeling. "Thou shalt know all my heart. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-351.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] Why should I conceal a thought or feeling from thee, when we are about to part forever? It is but trusting the grave with our secrets---it is but whispering in the ear of death, for soon we shall be dead to each other. To-morrow we shall be as shadows, every hour becoming more dim, and at length fading into nothing but a phantom of memory. Oh! Langley, if thou knewest how dear thou art to me! The first and last fruits of my heart are yours, for I never loved before but with filial affection. To be thine would fill the measure of my happiness---but it cannot be---there is a gulf between us that we must never pass. But I consecrate myself to thee while I live, and I give thee this first and last kiss in token that my lips shall never again be pressed by those of any man but my father." Saying this, she clasped him around the neck, and pressed her lips to his and wept on his bosom. He murmured vows of lasting love; he pressed her to his heart, and paid back the kiss with ample interest. Recovering a portion of her wonted self-command, she cut short his protestations. "Nay, dearest Langley, no vows, no oaths. Thou art, thou must be free. I am but a woman, and can, I trust, fulfil my humble duties in the little circle of domestic life, while I continue to cherish thy memory and devote myself to thee. But thou art a man, and shouldst devote thyself to thy fellow men. Thy father and thy mother, thy friends and thy country demand thy cares and exertions. Thou art called upon to perform all the duties of a man, which thou canst not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-352.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] do while devoted to one object alone. All I ask of thee is to remember me sometimes on an evening like this, when taking a lonely walk along the path we are now treading for the last time. I will be with thee then." Langley could not answer for his emotions, we might say his temptations. He longed to tempt her, by all the arts love teaches his votaries, to sacrifice all to love; to forget herself, her duties, and her home. But he was a man of principle, as well as feeling, and at length, by a great effort conquered the enemy. He felt it would be the most dastardly cruelty to attempt to persuade her to a step which would at the same time deprive her of one home without his being able to offer her another. He knew the bitter religious and political feelings of his father would exile them from his home and his heart, and determined to submit to his fate like a man. His reflections were interrupted by Miriam, who said, in a low, tremulous voice--- "Now it is time to go home. It is growing dark, and I must return." Langley made no opposition, for he was quite broken down. His reason yielded, but his heart rebelled; and his mind was benumbed by conflicting emotions. They proceeded in silence and gathering darkness, until they arrived at the rustic gate opening into the lawn, when Miriam softly said--- "Wilt thou not go in and bid my father farewell!" "No---I am no favorite, and my presence will scarcely be welcome. Tell him, if you will, that I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-353.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] wish him all the happiness of which he has deprived me." They paused awhile, as if each had something to say to the other. At length he whispered---"I must repay you the debt I owe," and taking her to his arms impressed a long, lingering kiss on her cold lips. Only one word was spoken---a mutual farewell. Miriam broke from his arms, proceeded rapidly towards home, and passing her father, merely said---"I will tell thee all to-morrow,"---ran to her chamber, and appeared no more that night. Langley did not return home till late in the night, having spent hours in wandering along the river side, recalling the sweet yet bitter banquet of the preceding hour. A Deserted Mansion---Captain Skeering---An Extraordinary Voyage without Tempest or Shipwreck---Arrival at Naumkeag---State of Affairs there---Mildred Suspected of Witchcraft---A Pilgrimage through the Wilderness---Scene on a River---Excommunication of the Demon of Water Power---End of the Pilgrimage. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-354.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] Next morning betimes the house of Harold Habingdon was deserted, the doors and windows closed, and no smoke curled from the chimney, as Langley looked that way, and saw its inmates departing to return no more. Then he turned away in all the apathy of chill despair. The little party proceeded to the capital, where, the vessel being ready, they speedily embarked, and Harold was once more on the seas, seeking a second asylum in the solitudes of the New World. The course of our story leads us to accompany him on his voyage. The vessel which carried Harold and his fortunes was in all respects so unlike a Liverpool or Havre packet of the present day, when far greater pains are taken to make people more comfortable abroad than at home, that to compare would only be to contrast them with each other. She was sorely laden with a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-355.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] miscellaneous cargo of such inconceivable articles, that though the insertion would save us at least a dozen pages of wear and tear of thought or invention, we are compelled to give it up in despair. It was a veritable cargo of notions, and the bill of lading almost as capacious as Captain Skeering's flying jib. The cabin, the lockers, and the rat holes, were all stowed choke full; and Harold, on insinuating himself into his birth, found his pillow stuffed with tobacco stems, which every body knows are an excellent commodity for snuff making. Now Captain Skeering well knew, that though the good people of Naumkeag abhorred smoking, yet did many of them quiet their consciences by snuff taking. Touching Captain Abiel Skeering, he was one of those strange, unaccountable, nondescripts, that never were, and never will be found anywhere, but in his own country. He cultivated a little farm, cobbled shoes in winter, and at intervals caught codfish, either along shore, or on the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador. Between whiles he traded to the Manhadoes, Virginia, and the West Indies, up Connecticut River, and the Lord knows where. There was not a hole or corner in which he did not poke his bowsprit to smell out a bargain; and what is very remarkable, he never went anywhere without finding one. He once made a capital speculation by being cast away on Cape Cod, not by defrauding the underwriters, but by exchanging rusty nails for wampum. In short, he was one of those wise men who never fail to convert a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-356.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] misfortune into a benefit. He was unquestionably an expert seaman, for he went where no one else ever thought of going; and though he never saw, heard, nor dreamed of a nautical almanac, managed to find his way all the world over, by dint of a combination of skill, luck, and sagacity. He was undoubtedly amphibious, and for aught we know, his mother might have been a mermaid, for his marine instincts seemed equal to those of our Indians in the woods. Though to use his own expression, "he had followed the sea ever since he was knee high to a grasshopper," he never met with but one disaster, out of which, as before stated, he made a capital speculation. Captain Skeering was, withal, an easy, quiet, good-tempered man, and reasonably honest; though when it came to a bargain, it must be confessed, he shaved rather close. Like all wise men, he preferred asking questions to answering them. He, moreover, smacked enormously of the Puritan, and he and Harold got on exceedingly well together, notwithstanding the latter was sometimes a little put out, by the captain putting in at rivers, creeks, bays, and inlets, to see if there was anything stirring in the way of a bargain, though to all appearance there was scarcely room to stick a pin in his vessel. He knew what people at ever so great a distance wanted, quite as well, if not better, than they did themselves; and if he could only be set going, you might pump out of him more practical knowledge than would set up an academy of science. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-357.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] Under the auspicious destiny of this sagacious, selftaught mariner, the vessel proceeded on her way, sometimes becalmed on the wide watery waste, and at others, somewhat rudely buffeted by the winds and waves. Captain Skeering put in at the Manhadoes, or New Amsterdam, then in its cradle, where he astonished the smoking burghers, by asking an infinite number of questions, whereby he gathered sufficient information to make a successful adventure to that famous port, on his next voyage. From thence the made a desperate push through the Helle-Gatte, escaped the Pot, the Frying Pan, and the Hog's Back; squinted at the little embryo settlement of New Haven; passed into the mouth of the Connecticut river, traded a day or two with the Indians of Montauk Point; had a great notion of trying his luck in Narragansett Bay; bartered a trifle at Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, and finally anchored triumphantly in Naumkeag Bay, after a prosperous voyage of six weeks. The Habingdons were received with a kind, brotherly hospitality by the good people of the town, and Harold at one time contemplated pitching his tent among them. But it happened, unluckily, that certain pious, well-meaning persons, who had been zealous advocates for toleration in the mother country, had, by some strange transition, become intolerant, and commenced the old story of persecution, so often repeated in the Christian world. The town was divided into parties, and peace was no longer there. Still, more than this, it was about this time that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-358.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] the extraordinary panic of witchcraft had found its way, like the cholera, from the Old to the New World. It was the characteristic superstition of the age, and by no means peculiar to Naumkeag, though it is said to have first broken out there in the colonies. Though without any foundation in nature, science, philosophy, or reason, this baleful superstition, which led to so many atrocities wherever it existed, by degrees spread throughout the little community, and was not only cherished, but fomented by men of liberal education and scientific attainments. A fast had been proclaimed by the clergy, with special reference to this visitation, and this ill-advised measure in some degree served to give the stamp of reality to the strange absurdities and extravagances which now only excite ridicule among the enlightened, and wonder among the ignorant. But however one age may plume itself on its freedom from superstitious delusions or impostures, there never has occurred, and probably never will occur, a period in which mankind has been, or will be, free from the delusions of their own imagination, or the designing impostures of others. Every age has its peculiar follies; and philosophers and philanthropists, who set about curing them, for the most part fare like physicians who, in driving out one disease, peradventure lay the foundation of half-a-dozen others. Credulity is a monster of capacious maw, and, like the fabled ogre, delights in human flesh. If the miracles of mesmerism, which come abroad under the mantle [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-359.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] of science, are true, necromancy is no longer a fable; if they are impostures, as doubtless most of them are, then had we best be silent on the delirium of witchcraft. Be this as it may, the community of Naumkeag was, at this time, beginning to feel the throes of that ideal convulsion which, after exhibiting certain premonitory symptoms, gradually seemed to die away, only to be felt with renewed violence a few years afterwards. It was, as before stated, the prevailing epidemic of the age; it raged in England as well as on the continent of Europe; and an old writer records that, on returning from Canada to his native province of Bearn, after an absence of some years, he found three-fourths of the inhabitants believing or affecting to believe themselves under the dominion of witchcraft. But while Harold was wavering as to his future course, he was brought to a speedy decision by receiving private information from one of the unbelievers, whom he had made his banker, that a little child, of some six or eight years old, who had exhibited decided symptoms of being bewitched, had, in one of its paroxysms, declared she saw the waiting-maid of the newly-arrived strangers sticking pins into her. This demonstration upon poor Mildred was not to be slighted at such a time; and it fortunately happening that, just at that moment, a party, consisting of a few families, was on the eve of setting out to form a new settlement, on a "platform," quite favorable to Harold's creed, he lost no time in associating himself [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-360.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] with the adventurers. Hastily adjusting his pecuniary affairs, and providing himself with the small outfit which could be conveyed such a long distance through the wild, he was on his way to the new Medina before the evil spirit made a second demonstration against poor old Mildred, who happily died in utter ignorance of having come nigh passing for a witch. The suddenness with which Harold changed his destination from one place to another at a great distance, may, perhaps, seem extraordinary, if not unnatural; but he had pulled up his anchor in England, and those who have severed the ties of their nativity never take such deep root elsewhere. The emigrants to America had a world before them, and we may trace much not only of the past, but future destinies of our country to that roaming and adventurous habit which pricks them ever onward towards the region of the setting sun. This propensity is one of the great instruments of Providence in shaping the destinies of a people such as the world never saw before. The perils, hardships, and privations of such a pilgrimage can never be properly realized even by the present race of emigrants to the far West. At that period, the savages environed them on every side, and they had no protector but Providence, and their own hands. The mother country paid little attention to her distant children, and never afforded them protection till they were able to protect themselves; and their own governments were little more than the united energies of their citizens, spontaneously tendered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-361.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] in time of danger. Those who went forth to establish new settlements in the wilderness were not only their own sword and shield, but their own legislators; and such adventures required a degree of intelligence, intrepidity, hardihood, and firmness which, if at this time exhibited on the great stage of the civilized world, would excite admiration. Their sufferings, their patience, their courage, their fortitude, and their faith have as yet scarcely awakened the poet, the painter, or the historian to the dignity of the theme; and, instead of being presented for the contemplation of their posterity as objects of grateful veneration, they are much oftener stigmatized as profligate adventurers, or harsh enthusiasts, or canting hypocrites, for having rescued a world from barbarism, made the howling wilderness to blossom as the rose, and laid the foundation of a glorious empire, greater by one-half than that of Rome, when called mistress of the world. The party of emigrants with which Harold had associated his fortunes, consisted of the families of men of respectable birth, education, and acquirements, who had left England from conscientious motives, rather than to better their fortunes. They were rigidly pious, and having abandoned their native country for the free exercise of their religious opinions, were determined to enjoy them to the fullest extent. Some differences among their preachers on points which at this time appear frivolous, but which were then deemed of great consequence, had divided the little community into factions, only the more inveterate from the slight [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-362.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] partition that separated them. A small party from the weaker sect had in consequence determined to seek freedom of conscience, or perhaps, the right of dictating to others, in a distant portion of the wilderness, as yet unoccupied by civilized men. It was practicable to proceed to their destination by water, and such had been their original design; but rumors of hostility on the part of some of the Indian tribes on Connecticut River, authenticated by the murder of the captain and crew of a coasting vessel, deterred the party from taking that route, and they pursued their journey by land, by a path hitherto only trod by the Indian moccasin. Each family had a covered waggon, drawn by either horses or oxen, containing some of the indispensable conveniences for housekeeping and farming, together with a supply of provisions. Attached to the band were a few laborers, or servants, as they were then termed, and a guide, belonging to the Praying Indians. Thus went they bravely forth to conquer the wilderness and extend the empire of Christianity, civilization, and liberty. It is not within the purpose of our story to enter into the particulars, or detail the daily progress of the little band, groping its way slowly and wearily among the giants of the primeval forests, so lonely, sad, and silent, that but for a little solitary woodpecker, or a chirping squirrel by day, and now and then a melancholy howl by night, it would have seemed a lifeless world. Neither squirrel nor woodpecker showed any symptoms of fear; sure sign they had never before [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-363.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] been visited by man, for he never makes the rural train his friend. Morning and evening hymns were sung by the pilgrim band; and now, for the first time, the sacred chaunt ascended to Heaven from the depths of that lonely forest. The toilsome day was not followed by quiet repose; for one half the men was always on the watch by night, and even weariness could not lull the apprehensions of the other to refreshing sleep. But not a heart sunk, or a spirit bowed, under these rough trials; and they cut their way through the woods, cheering each other on with hopeful anticipations. Miriam bore it like a heroine; but her mother almost sunk under fatigue and exposure, nor did she ever recover from their effects, which were shortly exhibited in the progress of a malady that finally brought her, after all her wanderings, to her last long home. At length they reached the banks of one of the fairest rivers of the New World, fed by a hundred winding streams, that like the veins of the human body convey the life-giving fluid from one extremity of the frame to the other. Coasting upwards along its level alluvial banks, where no tangled forests impeded their course, they at length arrived at the foot of a beautiful cascade, as yet unspoiled by the hand of that busy meddler, man; who, in this age of progress, wickedly sacrifices all the beauties of nature, and banishes all the naiads and the nymphs from their wonted haunts, to make way for that monstrous pagan demon, yclept the water power. There is some satisfaction in knowing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-364.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] that at least one half these sacrilegious caitiffs, who thus outrage the divinity of nature, are punished for their impiety even in this world. Sometimes retribution comes in the shape of a freshet, that sweeps away all his "improvements," as the rascal calls them, into chaos and night. The insulted river-god rises in his wrath, and in an hour avenges the atrocities of years. Sometimes the task devolves on another element, and the flames perform the work of destruction; and at others political economy punishes this conspiracy against the rights of nature, by letting loose her mysterious jargon of supply and demand, maximum and minimum, specific and ad-valorum duties; and last of all, the avenging spirit is let slip on them in the form of a new tariff, without protecting duties. Thus are the ringleaders of this crusade, the votaries of the demon of water power, punished in their generation, besides being compelled by the prickings of a guilty conscience to join a temperance society and perish on water. Halting at this romantic spot, one smiling evening of the merry month of June, within a day's journey of the land of promise, where they were to pitch their tents, they prepared for their simple repast. While the kettle was boiling, Miriam strolled a few hundred yards below, and from a projecting point, contemplated the wild, beautiful scene spread out before her by the bounteous prodigality of nature. The little caravan had encamped on the verge of a vast meadow, extending as far as the eye could reach, along either side of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-365.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] river below, under the wide-spread branches of a primeval elm, whose stately trunk, and deep tenacious roots, had for ages resisted the periodical floods, that swept away all else beside, and spread out into a wide expanse of waters, which diffused fertility wherever they flowed. The cattle were feeding, or reposing in the high luxuriant grass; the smoke of the newlylighted fire curled upwards gracefully; the kettle began to simmer, and Goody Mildred, no longer in jeopardy from witchcraft, assisted by others, was as busy as a bee, about the table, which it is said was neither mahogany or rosewood. All else was the silence and repose of nature in her primitive nakedness, save nature's lulling music---the solemn plunge of the river, falling over a cliff of rocks in all the forms of rich, fantastic grandeur---wild, savage, and majestic, yet still beautiful. Hurled headlong by the impetus of its fall, it rushed over an inclined plane, the impatient masses pushing forward in a quick succession of circular waves, that struck by the slanting rays of the setting sun, almost blinded her eyes by the flashing effulgence of their splendors, and the swiftness of their motion. While gazing on this Paradise of the wilderness, her mind was not there. Sometimes it wandered towards the sunny South, and after lingering awhile, returned to dwell upon the strange vicissitudes of her past life. Here she stood, alone on a spot never before trod by the footsteps of her race. She was in a new world; her birth-place, her native land, were far away---so [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-366.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] far, that England seemed more remote than the stars that now one by one began to twinkle sleepily, and at far distances above her head. She could see them though distant and unapproachable; but her country was out of sight, and equally beyond her reach. She felt she should never see it more, and nevermore is akin to eternity. Yet was she not sorrowful. There was a vastness and sublimity in this boundless solitude; a grandeur in her loneliness, that though awakening neither smiles or gladness, touched her soul with the inspiration of poetic thought, within whose magic sphere nothing is reality, and even melancholy is happiness. Her eyes grew dim, she knew not why; and such was the luxury of her grateful tears, that like the summer shower, they made every object seem more fresh and glowing. She returned to partake of the simple fare, to join in the evening hymn, and to enjoy the sweet repose of an unreproving conscience. The next day they reached their destination, and prepared themselves, not to rest from the cares of life, but to begin the world anew. The New Home---Statistical View of a Young Lady's Heart---A Conversation--- A Loss Never to be Repaired---Two Griefs Better than One---The First Grave in the Church-Yard. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-367.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] The spot chosen by our Pilgrims to settle down upon, like a flock of vagrant birds, had been previously purchased of the Indians, for we don't know how many fathoms of wampum, an aboriginal currency much preferable to paper money, because it was the product of labor and skill. It could not be made for nothing, out of nothing. The surrounding scene was of rare, surpassing beauty. A vast expanse of verdant greensward, level as a floor, and smoothe as a shaven lawn, extended up and down for many miles, entirely free from forest or tree, save here and there a stately elm dotted the landscape. No woodman's axe, the great weapon of the sturdy pioneer, was here required to prepare the ground for ploughing; for except that no fence or hedge marked the division of property, the fields looked as if they had been cultivated for centuries. A noble river, which courses the country a thousand [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-368.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] miles, flowed in graceful curves and silent serenity through the vast meadows, its course marked by two rows of gigantic trees, some of whose roots were laid bare by the ravages of the stream, which in the spring, when the snows of the distant mountains melted, spread a wide sea of waters over all the verdant plain. Some three quarters of a mile from the river, arose a natural terrace, corresponding to its windings, about fifty or sixty feet high, smoothe as art could have made it, and sloping gently down to meet the level below. From the summit of this terrace commenced another plain of lesser width, and not so smoothe or luxuriant of grass, which extended to the base of a range of lofty wooded hills, that bent round in a curve, and terminated towards the south, in a peaked mountain towering above the rest of the chain. To the north, the view was similar, but far more extensive, and was terminated by the conical summit of the grand Monadnoc, lifting its head aloft in the blue distance of the skies. No where could be seen a trace of the footsteps or the hand of man; and yet the landscape wanted nothing but flocks, and herds, and piping shepherds, to recall to mind those scenes of the golden age, over which the youthful fancy loves to linger, and which the wicked wise ones of these iron times call a fable or a dream. All around was peace, repose and silence. Yet there lurked in the recesses of the surrounding wilderness an enemy more cunning, fierce, and unrelenting than the barbarians that sacked the mistress of the world. Solitude was no refuge here; silence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-369.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] was not peace; and the repose of the night was more harrassing than the toils of the day. But the troubles of the mind, like the exertions of the body, dispose to rest; and they soon learned to sleep soundly in the midst of unseen dangers. With the exception of a small number of servants, the head of each of these families had sufficient means to purchase all the essentials of comfort and convenience required in this simple stage of society; but the distance and difficulties of transportation for a considerable period confined them to what was indispensable. Harold was the richest of them all, and had in the hands of his agent at Naumkeag a sum that made him wealthy, compared to his fellow adventurers. In the course of that brief period which changes, as if by magic, the face of all things in this New World, they were comfortably settled, and becoming gradually familiarized to the sense of home. The rich alluvial meadows became animated with lowing herds, and the verdant hills by flocks of sheep; the tolling bell was heard for the first time from the humble spire of the rustic church; the echoes of the hills repeated the song of thanksgiving; and under the protecting branches of a spreading elm stood a little log cabin, from which on week days might be heard the sound of many voices, repeating lessons in most harmonious discord. Though the Puritans denounced the doctrine of good works, there were at least two which they never failed to perform. They laid a foundation for religion and knowledge, by building churches and schoolhouses. They had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-370.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] not adopted that pernicious dogma which makes knowledge the great if not the sole basis of morals; nor had they lost sight of the melancholy truth which the experience of every day is verifying, that unless morals keep pace with intelligence, the latter, so far from being the handmaid of virtue, only makes the possessor more dextrous in fraud, and increases his powers of mischief. Ignorance is far preferable to error: the former is a passive, the latter an active instrument of evil. One is the player, the other the instrument played upon. In ancient times, and in the Old World, when adventurers went forth to plant new colonies, it was under military leaders, and the sword was the great instrument for clearing the wilderness. But our little pilgrim band was led by a minister of peace, to whom all looked up with respectful veneration, and his advice was little less than law. And truly, the shepherd who thus led his flock into the wilderness merited all their affection and confidence. He was zealous without bigotry; loved his own faith without hating that of others; and set an example of all that his precepts enforced. He preached the doctrine of love, not that of fear; and preferred to lure his flock to the fold by the hope of eternal bliss, rather than the fear of eternal punishment. He was their law and their gospel. To an American---and for such alone we write--- nothing can be more interesting than the growth of a new settlement in the wilderness. It is a complete exemplification of the progress of society, a theme that hitherto has been more the theory of philosophical [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-371.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] abstractions than the result of actual experience. In its first institution, a community is governed by public opinion which, is powerful in proportion to the smallness of the circle in which it operates; and the great inquest of society is the expounder, as well as enforcer, of the law. Where all are intimately associated, the good or ill opinion of every one is essential, because its consequences are directly felt; and no man, unless so debased as to have lost the sense of shame, can exist amid the contempt of all around him. The atmosphere being confined, is poisoned by a single breath; and where all live together, and all partake in one common interest, the object of general contempt or abhorrence is under sentence of banishment, as surely as was the ancient Roman when prohibited the use of fire and water. The swarms that from time to time issued from the parent hives were also invariably subjected to imminent dangers from the savages, who, like the wild beasts of the forest, lurked everywhere. Hence sprung another substitute for laws---the tie of common danger; which, united with a common interest in the prosperity of all, formed as strong a bond of union, and as impressive an obligation of restraint, as either laws or constitutions could devise. Every man felt that his own safety depended on those immediately around him, and of consequence, that it was equally his interest as his duty to assist in defending them. There was no necessity for laws or precepts to teach him his obligations to society. The law of nature, the first [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-372.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] impulses of reason taught him this. When the Creator of the universe gave to man the privilege of free will, in the government of his own actions, he laid down certain immutable principles, or laws of nature, by which that free will is in some measure restrained; and gave him the faculty of reason to comprehend those laws so far as they are necessary to the conduct of human actions: such among others are the obligations that we should live honestly, hurt no one, and render to all their due. No civil laws are, or ought to be obligatory, that come in conflict with the law of nature, implanted in the heart of every rational being by the impulses of Infinite Wisdom. It is to this we trace that otherwise inexplicable paradox, the voluntary submission of man to laws of his own making. All this and more was exemplified in the little community whose progress we are sketching. Far out of the reach of the parent hive, they, like the new swarm of bees, carried with them the instincts of nature and the habits of social life. There was, for years, no power on earth to coerce them from abroad; and, though they appointed magistrates and adopted laws, their submission was voluntary, since there was no authority to enforce the decrees of one, or execute the precepts of the others. There were few crimes among them, and these were, for a time, only punished by the community. If a man committed a wrong to his neighbor, or defrauded him in any way, he was, to use a phrase common in such cases, "hunted out of the community." Whenever he came into the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-373.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] presence of his companions, he was received with scorn, and, if he dared to resent it, all united against him, so that it never failed that the delinquent soon found it necessary to seek a home where his offence was unknown. Slander was kept in awe and punished, by all uniting in proclaiming that the delinquent was unworthy of belief, on any occasion whatever. Thus, if they happened to speak the truth, no one would believe them; and, though there were no courts for a time to punish them, by awarding damages, they underwent one of the severest of punishments---universal avoidance and contempt. In short, it seldom happened that they were not "hated out," and obliged to go where they were not known. Thus it would seem possible for a well-disposed community to exist, at least for a time, without being burdened by a multiplicity of laws, at least one-half of which operate as peevish restraints, without conducing either to the morals or peace of society. But it is high time to individualize, and return to the principal persons of our tale. To be alone in the world, is not to be out of the reach of its calamities. They track the footsteps of man even through the illimitable wilds; they require no "blazing" of the trees, no compass, or north star to direct their chase after the invisible fugitive, but scent him like bloodhounds, and run him down at last. Happiness is everywhere, or nowhere; and to pursue it from one place to another is to chase a shadow. The fatigues and privations of a tedious voyage, followed by the exposures of a long journey through the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-374.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] wilderness, had made deep inroads on the constitution of Susan Habingdon, which now began to exhibit alarming symptoms of decay. Schooled in the painful vicissitudes of life, she never complained, but bore her increasing infirmities with quiet acquiescence, as the invisible enemy worked his sure progress, and undermined the frail citadel of life. So almost imperceptible was his approach, that those who lived under the same roof, and saw her continually, were not aware of it, though the neighbors had, long ago, predicted that her days were numbered, and her pilgrimage near its end. But Harold, as yet, saw it not; he was daily becoming more intensely devout; the sentiment of devotion seemed gradually to absorb all others, and deaden the feelings of nature in his heart. He became, in a great measure, abstracted from worldly affairs; passed much of his time alone, indulging in long fits of gloom, during which he seemed more under the dominion of imagination than reality, and his naturally poetical temperament displayed itself in occasional flights of lofty eloquence. Miriam, too, cherished a master feeling, which, if it did not monopolize, was perpetually intruding on her mind; and, though sometimes a sudden pang would thrill through her bosom, as she fancied her mother looked ill, she continued unheeding of the fatal crisis now close at hand. Such was the state of things, when, one day, as Miriam was sitting at her spinning-wheel, not turning it indeed at the moment, but thinking of one far away, her mother, who was reclining languidly in an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-375.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] easychair, of most homely fashion, now almost her only resting-place during the day, addressed her in a languid voice, accompanied by a still more languid smile--- "Who art thou thinking of, Miriam?" said she. Miriam started from her reverie, but promptly replied--- "I was thinking of Langley, mother." "What wert thou thinking about him, my child? Thou knowest it is all in vain." "I know it, mother; yet still it is a pleasure to think of him. I wonder if he ever thinks of me? I should like to know. But why should I doubt? He promised me he would, and he never breaks his word." "Ah! my poor Miriam, years have passed since we parted from him, and, in that time, many forget and many are forgotten. Think of the changes of this world, at every passing moment---how many come into, how many go out of it, at every ticking of the clock." "True, dear mother---but still we may think of absent friends, and like the magicians of old, conjure up their images, though far away." "Miriam! Miriam! You are wasting your heart on ideal nothings. On that which has no existence." "Mother! dear mother! what dost thou, what canst thou mean?" "It must be known," said Susan, as if communing with herself. "And better it should come from the lips of a mother than those of a stranger. Miriam [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-376.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] canst thou bear to hear what I can scarcely bear to tell?" "Tell---tell---tell me mother quickly. Anything is better than what I feel this moment. O tell me--- has anything befallen Langley?" "There is bad news for thee, Miriam---at least thou wilt think it so. Be calm, my love. There is news of Langley Tyringham---bad news." "Is he dead?" gasped Miriam. "Listen, and be calm, as becomes one who belongest to a race whose appointed vocation is to endure many losses, many sorrows. Our neighbor Westport has returned from Boston and informed thy father, that a vessel passing up the Sound picked up a dead body, in whose pocket-book were found letters to the Governor and other persons in Boston. These letters were from the Governor of Virginia, and others of the colony." "The name---the name---mother. But I know it well. It was Langley Tyringham," interrupted Miriam, with almost phrenzied earnestness. "It was indeed, my daughter. Besides this, a hat was picked up on the beach in which his name was written at full length. Lean on me, Miriam---thou art fainting, and remember that to hope humbly, and bear patiently, are among the brightest virtues of woman." But Miriam was not fainting though white as snow, and almost as cold. Nor did she weep, or wring her hands, but remained silent a few minutes. At length [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-377.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] she drew a deep shuddering sigh, and calmly said to her mother--- "Well, be it so. He is no farther from me in Heaven than he was on earth. I shall meet him there, but I could never meet him here. But mother--- dear mother---how ill thou lookest. Surely thou art not well---I never saw thee thus before." "I have exerted myself too much, and felt too much. But now we are talking of death, let me say something of myself, for death and I will soon be one." "Mother! dear mother!" "Yes, daughter, it is time thou wert prepared--- alas! must I inflict another blow! To me the cares and sorrows of this world appear as nothing---my vision is of another. But I wish I could have been spared this painful communication. I hoped either Harold or thou wouldst have observed the change I see and feel myself. But he is otherwise occupied, and thou---poor Miriam---thou hast had other thoughts to occupy thee. But it must be delayed no longer. It is time thou shouldst know that I am not long for this world. Death has been a long time approaching slowly, but the nearer he comes the quicker his pace. A few weeks, a few days---nay, perhaps a few hours, and thou wilt be without a mother." This second blow, for a while banished the remembrance of the first. Miriam no longer thought of Langley Tyringham. Another and a holier feeling occupied her heart. She gazed intensely on the face of her mother, and struck for the first time with that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-378.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] indescribable expression, which indicates approaching dissolution, cast herself on her knees before her, exclaiming in the bitterness of self-reproach--- "Forgive---O! forgive me, dear mother! My own selfish thoughts have made me blind to what I now see too plainly." "I have nothing to forgive, Miriam, and rejoice that thou hast been spared many hours of painful anticipation of what all thy cares could not avert. And now, as this may be the last time I shall have breath to commune with thee, let me here bear testimony to thy dutiful and loving conduct during all thy past life. Thou hast been to thy parents a never-failing source of comfort; their solace in exile, and amid all the strange vicissitudes of their weary pilgrimage; and be this thy best consolation when I am gone, that thou hast fulfilled all thy filial duties, and that the dead cannot reproach thee. When thou recallest me, as thou wilt do sometimes, I know it will not be with a feeling of regret or remorse for remembered wilfulness, or disobedience, but with a pleasing melancholy, arising from the assurance I now give thee, that thou hast never drawn a tear from my eyes, save of joy or affection, nor a sigh from my heart, but of anxiety for thy welfare. Go, now my child, and commune with thine own soul awhile, for there is no comforter like an approving conscience." Miriam retired into solitude in obedience to her mother, with a heart rent by conflicting emotions. But two griefs are better than one, since by alternately [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-379.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] taking place of each other, they prevent the mind from fastening on either, with that intense, unchangeable tenacity, which, if long continued, causes a total wreck of either body or mind. Such was the case with Miriam, who, in the deep solicitude and overwhelming apprehensions connected with the state of her mother, found a temporary refuge from the bitterness of that besetting sorrow with which the death of Langley was destined to render her familiar hereafter. Susan Habingdon died about ten days after this conversation, as it may be supposed such a woman would die; not shouting delirious hallelujahs of triumph, in frantic enthusiasm, or shrinking with fearful forebodings from the dread hereafter, but with the sweet, calm resignation of a pious soul---hoping, yet hoping humbly. Hers was the first grave in the little church-yard; and the only monument erected to her memory was in the hearts of her husband, her child, and her neighbors. She lay alone for awhile, but in process of time, her grave became surrounded by many little mounds, and at this time their numbers almost equal those of the descendants of the little band of Pilgrims, that live and move around them.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-380.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] Calamity never leaves us where it finds us. It either softens or hardens the heart. With some, the wounded spirit subsides into cold insensibility, and every blow serves only to harden it into stern resistance, accompanied by a disregard to the sufferings of others; with some, it finds its best solace for the loss of the dead in administering to the happiness of the living. There are those who, smarting under the recollection of the loss of some beloved being, retire, as it were, within themselves, and shrink from forming new ties, lest they should be again severed by the angel of death, who seems to shoot his arrows at random, careless whose heart he splits asunder; and there are others, who only cling more closely to what is left, from attachment to what is gone forever. Harold Habingdon belonged to this latter class; and from the period of Susan's death, seemed to concentrate his worldly thoughts and affections on his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-381.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] daughter. No longer the stern, unbending father, sacrificing everything to what he called his principles, he became the tender, affectionate guardian, the confidential friend. When, after months had passed away, he saw little if any mitigation in the calm, settled melancholy of Miriam, and sometimes observed traces of those secret tears that always come from the heart; when he marked her struggles to be cheerful only followed by increasing paleness and dejection he became convinced there was a deeper cause at work than grief for the death of her mother. He, too, had learned the melancholy fate of Langley; and now that death had placed the barrier of the grave between him and his daughter, his heart softened towards him, and he sometimes caught himself regretting that he had so sternly opposed a union that might at the same time have secured her happiness, and brought her a protector when her father was no more. He thought that, perhaps, instead of becoming a convert to his faith, Miriam might gradually have brought him to adopt her own. But it was now too late, and the very impossibility of the marriage ever taking place increased his regrets for his past opposition. Had Langley been living, and at hand, it is probable his former dislike might have continued, and increased; but being now forever removed beyond the possibility of giving offence, Harold sincerely desired an opportunity of making atonement by sanctioning what he had so sternly opposed. Mankind are never so anxious to make amends for injury or unkindness, as when the time for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-382.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] doing so is past forever. They can forgive the dead, but not the living. Influenced by these new-born feelings, he one day questioned Miriam on the subject of her continued depression "I do not wish," said he, "to prevent your weeping over the loss of what can never be restored either to you or to me---a faithful wife, and tender mother. But sorrow, like joy, should have its limits; and if time did not cure, or at least alleviate our griefs for the loss of those we love, the world would be clothed in perpetual mourning and sadness. I do not wish to prevent your indulging your sorrow, since it is not for us to expect to pass through this vale of tears, without adding our tribute to the waters of bitterness. Happiness, my daughter, soons becomes tired of the same companion, and seeks new associates. We may have happy days, but not happy lives. If thy mother is permitted to look down upon us, she will grieve to see thee unhappy so long." "Father," said Miriam, with her usual frank simplicity, "I have other cause of grief than the loss of my dear mother. There is another grave for me to weep over." "I understand thee, Miriam; and if it can be any consolation to thee to know it, I declare that were poor Langley Tyringham alive, I would now trust your faith and your happiness to his keeping; for Heaven only knows how long it may be before you require a protector in this wild region." "Dear father!" cried Miriam, with tears of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-383.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] gratitude, "you have taken a load from my heart. What though I can never be his, that I shall see him no more, it is a sweet consolation for me to know that my father at last thinks of him with kindness, and would accept him as a son. I shall be happier now, for I can think of him without offending you." As she said this her face brightened, her deep pensive eye sparkled as if with a flash of newly-awakened hope, and a long absent stranger appeared in the likeness of a flush on her cheeks. From that time her depression gradually subsided into something like patient cheerfulness, and she went about her household duties with new vivacity. The stern winter of that northern region had now passed away, and the joyous spring, which had only awaited the melting of the snow, now leaped forth as if full grown from under the shelter of her frozen canopy. The sweet south wind, the most balmy breath of nature, gently curled the surface of the glad river, now released from its icy fetters, and murmuring as if enjoying its newly-acquired freedom; the fresh meadows put forth their brightest verdure; and now and then a chirping bird, just returned from its southern tour, chaunted his joyous song among the buds and expanding leaves, whose foliage seemed as soft and fleecy as the reflection of the woods in the bosom of some glassy lake. Miriam, one afternoon, pointed out these newly-arrived strangers to her father, and proposed a walk to the high-peaked mountain, heretofore noted, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-384.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] rose gently from the river until it suddenly changed its aspect, and shot like a pyramid into the skies. It was not difficult of ascent in one part, and was now free from snow. Harold gladly assented, and the mountain being nigh at hand, they reached the summit in time to see the setting sun in all his glory, giving his evening farewell to a world which lay beneath their view in all directions. It was a scene of most enchanting beauty and sublimity. The river gracefully winding, and turning, and lingering with sweet delay among the broad meadows; the vast expanse of waving woods, undulating hills, and towering mountains peering among the blue skies, as blue as them, and almost as transparent; the sublime distance of the horizon, and the endless variety of objects spread out before them, all formed a scene that elevated the soul to the loftiest conceptions of infinite power and infinite wisdom. Both for a while paid it the homage of silence. At length Miriam exclaimed--- "What a beautiful world! and what a pity it cannot last for ever." "True," answered the father---"all that we see around; all that is, and all that shall ever be, is destined to perish, how soon no one knows, no prophet can predict. But the time will surely come, when this earth shall crumble into a heap of smoking ashes; the sea exhale in scalding steam; and the sun consume in his own fires. Of all created things, animate and inanimate, visible and invisible, in this vast [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-385.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] uncircumscribed universe, there is nothing immortal but the soul of man." "Thou sayest truly, Harold Habingdon," answered a strange voice, as he ended this burst of pious enthusiasm; and turning round, he beheld an aged man with white hair and beard, leaning on his staff. "You seem to know me, my friend," said Harold, "but I cannot recollect ever seeing you before." "That I do not wonder at," answered the old man--- "for since you saw me, I have been hunted like a wild beast from my lair in the Old World only to be hunted in the New. I have lived in forests and in caves; above ground, and under ground; and for years past have not dared to enjoy the light of day, save when I sometimes crawl forth like a fox from his hole, to breathe the pure air of this mountain, and contemplate a world that has forsaken me." Miriam was awed by the looks and words of the white-haired old man, and Harold now felt a strange conviction that he had seen him before. Again he asked who he was. "One of the judges of kings," answered he proudly. "Hah!---I know you now, though it is long since we met. You are---" "Hush!" said the old man---"breathe not my name, even in the solitudes of nature, least the very echoes should betray me. You know me, that is enough." "Yes---though you are greatly changed since I last saw you on Marston Moor." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-386.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] "True---years have done much, and hardships more. I need not tell my story, for you have mixed in the world, and know it all. If not, I will one day tell you, that you may learn how surely it is the destiny of man to be a slave. If he does not carry the yoke on his neck, he will wear the ring in his nose; if not driven, he will be led; and if he casts off the chains of one tyrant, it is only to put on those of another. Wretched were they who toil and shed their blood, to emancipate their fellow-creatures, had they not within them an approving conscience, which is its own reward. I sat in judgment on a king, who was guilty of treason against his people; who conspired against their rights; who made war on them in support of his unlawful pretensions, and caused England to smoke with the blood of her children. In my inmost soul, I believed him worthy of death; and I thought that such a high example of justice might serve as a warning to those who profanely call themselves the vicegerents of Heaven, by showing them there was an earthly tribunal to which they were amenable---that the justice of man might overtake them even in this world." "Yet he is called a martyr," said Harold. "Martyr to what?" cried the old man vehemently. "Was he a martyr to his religion when leaguing with the Irish Papists against the Church he had sworn to protect? Was he a martyr to liberty when he raised his standard against those who were striving to secure it to the people? Or was he a martyr to his country [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-387.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] when he pointed his sword at her bosom and stabbed her to the heart?" " I said not he was a martyr, my friend," resumed Harold; "for though he may not have suffered according to the forms of law, I think he suffered justly. I am not one of those who hold that kings are the vicegerents of Heaven, and govern by divine right. Nor, if they did, do I believe that God delegates any power to kings, but that of doing good, since he does not possess the power himself of doing evil, and therefore cannot confer it on others." "Assuredly you are right," replied the old man; "and what if there be no legal tribunal established, to punish the crimes of kings? Shall they, therefore, be permitted to abuse their power and oppress the people without punishment; and must they wait patiently till the hand of Heaven interposes, and puts a period to their mortal existence, by course of nature? No, Harold Habingdon, the just vengeance of an injured people is as much an instrument of the Most High, for His great purposes, as plague, pestilence, and famine, the tempest and the earthquake. Such was my creed. I may have been mistaken; if so, I have paid the penalty, by being exiled from my country, my home, and all I loved, to become a wanderer on the face of the earth." "It is a hard fate, and I pity you." "Hard indeed, and almost more than I can bear; for the perpetual struggle, to resist and endure what I have encountered, has almost shaken my reason, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-388.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] made me sometimes a visionary, I fear. The pen of history is now in the hands of the scribes of kings, and those who dared to set a high example of justice, at the expense of a head that wore a crown, will be handed down to posterity as traitors and regicides. But"---and here the eyes of the old man brightened as if with some new hope---"But there is still one consolation left me. I look to a new world, and a new people, to do justice to my memory. From all that I can see and judge, a new race will spring up in this great region of the west. The people who are daily flocking hither are destined to be free. They have been fitted for entering on their rich inheritance in the preparatory school of England, when great teachers were abroad. They have suffered too much in the Old World by civil and religious oppression, ever willfully to inflict it on themselves. They find no impregnable bulwarks of oppression here; no greybeard abuses, hallowed by time, whose roots and branches are inseparably intertwined with the very vitals of the social system; no massive castles or splendid palaces to overawe, or shame the humble cottage; no titled satraps, or regal pageants to dazzle the eye and subjugate the mind; no long-cherished consciousness of inferiority, descending from generation to generation, until it grows to be a second nature; no great standing armies of hirelings, that under pretense of enforceing the law or defending the state, for ever become the chosen instruments of oppression; no bristling bayonets pointed at the heart, to quell the throbbings of liberty. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-389.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] This New World is destined to be free. It cannot be otherwise. All those great universal causes that constitute the instruments of Providence in governing the world, combine for the fulfilment of my prediction. Here, at least, I and my fellow-sufferers will have justice one day done them by millions of freemen, who will adopt the great maxim, that rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God. This is the hope that lights my way, and enables me to support the load of life, now, thanks be to Heaven, rapidly drawing to an end." The old man spoke with all the enthusiasm which belongs to those animated by a spark of hope lighted from the darkness of despair. The energy of his language and the vigor of his thoughts strangely contrasted with his ghostly appearance, which reminded Miriam of one just risen from the dead. He might be likened to one of those pale, sickly plants, which have lost their natural wholesome color, by being shut up in the dark, deprived of the cheerful air and bracing sunshine. Harold had served with him in the civil wars, and they conversed together, till the evening twilight warned them that it was time to separate. The old man told his story; and surely if the act of condemning a king, whose conduct none living now dare to justify, originated in erroneous principles or culpable notions, the penalty was sufficiently severe. From his arrival in the New World, himself and his companions in exile were hunted through the Colonies by the agents of Charles the Second, with a perseverance that rendered their escape little less than a miracle. After [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-390.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] living in forests and caves, where they were fed by some neighboring colonists, who doubted the claim of Charles to the dignity of a martyr, they at length found a last refuge in the home of a worthy clergyman, whose remote situation afforded them a prospect of security. But even here they were obliged to seclude themselves within doors, and generally in the cellar. For a series of years they were entirely lost to the world. More than a century elapsed from the period of their disappearance, before it became known what had become of them; and the fate of the survivor, after the death of his companions, is still shrouded in oblivion. Whither he wandered, where he died, or where he was buried, no one knows, or will probably ever know. It cannot, however, be denied that they were men of pith and nerve, for they set an example that had no precedent in the history of the world, and taught posterity that the offences of monarchs, like those of their subjects, may be punished by the sentence of a court, instead of the sacrifice of the people they govern. No act on record so shook the thrones of despots, or so effectually stripped kings of their divinity. Since that memorable example, the distance between monarchs and their people has been gradually diminishing; they are approaching each other, and the time may not be far distant when they will change places. Harold pressed the old man to come and reside with him. But he shook his white locks, and declined to accept what might cost his friend his life. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-391.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] "It cannot be," said he, "I am a bird of night, or rather a beast of prey, who only ventures forth in the dark, not to hunt his game, but to be himself hunted if discovered. That I venture out at all is owing to an irrepressible longing I sometimes feel to breathe the free air and enjoy a short interval of liberty. I go forth at night, and ramble through the mountains all day, when I again return to my lair. I will not tell you where that is, not that I doubt your honor or discretion. But I expect secrecy from those I have trusted, and who have trusted me, and must be secret myself. I saw and knew you, and could not resist the desire of meeting an old companion in arms in the same cause. But it is time to part, and for this young maiden to be at home. Farewell, and may you find all you sought in the New World." They separated each to go his way. On their return towards home Miriam asked her father the name of the old grey-headed man, but he shook his head and only said--- "Thou knowest he is one of the Judges of Kings, for such he has announced himself. Thou knowest, too, that his life is in danger, and only depends upon the secrecy of others. I know I could count securely on you, but I have no right to call on you for the exertion of a discretion which I could not myself practice. Ask me then no more to tell his name." Miriam was satisfied, and nothing was said on the subject, at that or any future time. A Living Rival to a Dead Man---Some Account of a Man with a Good Character at Home, and an Indifferent One Abroad---Approved System of Courtship which, however, Does not Succeed---The New Suitor Thinks Miriam Is Looking in a Strange Place for a Husband. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-392.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] For some time past there had appeared increasing symptoms that the memory of Langley Tyringham was about to have a formidable rival in the person of an exceedingly staid, sober, and somewhat canting neighbor, whose visits to Harold became gradually more and more frequent. This person had by perseverance in a long, rigid course of hypocrisy, meanness, and successful trickery in a small way, accompanied by no direct violation of the law, managed to acquire what in these simple, economical times was considered an adequate fortune, and that without forfeiting the respect of those with whom he never had any dealings in the way of business at home. He always went to a distance to make his bargains, and though his reputation was not a little out at the elbows abroad, at home he was generally respected as a consummate specimen of religious worldliness, being a strict observer of all the decorums of life, as well as all the ordinances of the community. In short, he was one [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-393.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] of those not very uncommon characters, who squared his conduct rather by the law than the gospel, and so long as he had the former on his side, dispensed with the latter. These are the most dangerous of all men to deal with, and we advise our readers to have as little to do with them as possible. The greatest scoundrel we ever knew was one who squared his conduct exactly by law, and considered everything right which it did not prohibit. Though not actually a lawyer by profession, he was well versed in the law, having made it one of his principal studies, to learn precisely, and to a hair, how far he could go without burning his fingers, or entangling himself in its cobwebs. It is quite certain, however, that Tobias Harpsfield--- for so was he called---with all his circumspection could not disguise from his own heart that he was an arrant rogue. So entirely engrossed was he by selfishness, that in shaping his course he never thought of anybody but himself, nor did it ever occur to him that there was any other person whose interest or convenience was to be consulted. If he ever on any occasion sacrificed to these, it was only in small matters, and in the certain anticipation of some greater advantage to be derived from his self-denial. Still, with all this, he was called "a very decent man," and decency, like charity, covers a multitude of sins. Tobias---who, it is as well to state, was not one of the original band of Pilgrims---had for some time past been "calculating," as his phrase was, the great advantages of a union with Miriam Habingdon. In a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-394.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] speculative mission to Naumkeag, he ascertained that Harold had a very considerable sum in the hands of his agent there, and as Miriam was his only child, she would be sole heiress as a matter of course. True, thought he in the course of his calculation, "Master Habingdon is not an old man, and may marry again; but I calculate the chances are ten to one against that, and in my favor, for women are mighty scarce in these parts; and in the second place, I don't think I ever saw him speak to any woman but his wife and daughter, except when obliged to do so. At all events, I shall come in for a good slice, if I marry the girl, and half a loaf is better than no bread." So Tobias calculated he would fall in love, and marry the pretty heiress. He followed up his conclusion by more frequent visits, until at length both Miriam and her father became so accustomed to see him, that they were scarcely aware of his presence. Harold continued to read or ruminate, after the usual salutations, and Miriam pursued her domestic occupations just as if they were alone. So much was she occupied by thinking of another, that it is extremely doubtful whether she ever thought at all of Tobias, or asked herself the meaning of some very original, outlandish demonstrations he achieved from time to time. We have observed in the course of our experience, that your cunning rogues who are ever on the watch for prey, are perhaps of all men the most liable to be deceived. They are so intent on overreaching others, that they [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-395.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] have no leisure to take care of themselves, and exemplify the fable of the Fowler and the Dove. In attacking the quarters of the enemy, they forget to defend their own; and hence it commonly happens that a series of successful roguery, ends at last in the deceiver becoming the dupe. Not that our upright, gentle Miriam was a deceiver--- for if she ever deceived any one, it was herself. She treated Tobias civilly, because she cared so little about him that she never divined his object, and referred his visits entirely to her father. If she had really known what it was, it is highly probable that notwithstanding all her Christian forbearance, she might peradventure have thrown the distaff at his head; for with the quick intuitive sagacity of woman, she had penetrated the dark recesses of his character, and despised him heartily. Women are seldom deceived in men except by their own passions. Thus Tobias thought himself sailing with wind and tide, when he was in fact entirely becalmed; and having at length calculated that if he broke the ice, he would catch the fish, he opened his mind to Harold, who to say the truth received his communication with more surprise than disapprobation, for he was quite ignorant of the inward man of Tobias. A few minutes' reflection brought to his mind the unprotected state of Miriam in the event of his being called away by the messenger that stops sooner or later at every man's door; and in addition to this, the hope that new ties and duties might in time heal the deep wound he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-396.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] could well see still festered in the heart of Miriam, rendered him, if not favorably inclined, at least not averse to the proposal. What rendered it still more palatable, was the idea that this union would not separate him from his daughter. These thoughts flitted rapidly through his mind, and resulted in a permission to make his proposal known to Miriam. Tobias had hoped the affair might have been settled, like a royal marriage, by proxy; but there being no help for it, he proceeded to the little sitting room peculiarly appropriated to Miriam, conning a declaration by the way, a great portion of which is for ever lost to posterity. Before he had half finished, he met such a look of mingled anguish, contempt and repugnance from the young maiden, that he fairly lost his utterance, though a man of great self-possession, that being necessary to his vocation. The heart-stricken Miriam rose, tottered towards the door, and said to him in a voice agitated by deep emotion, as she turned to leave the room--- "Go to my father, and tell him when I seek a husband it will be in the grave." Tobias did as directed, and Harold assured him that the answer was decisive. He would never, he said, again exert his authority, or influence her decision in a matter so dceply interesting to his daughter, having seen and felt the consequence of such interference. Tobias departed full of the gall of bitterness, meditating schemes of malice and revenge, but at the same [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-397.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] time could not help thinking the grave was rather a strange place for a young lady to look for a husband. When he was out of sight, Miriam put on her straw bonnet---the work of her own hand---and walked forth in the holy stillness of the modest twilight, along the smooth grassy terrace which formed what is called the second bank of the river. Her heart seemed to have received a new wound from the proposal to substitute another idol there, and she strictly scrutinized her past deportment towards Tobias Harpsfield, to satisfy herself that she had never in word, deed, or look encouraged him to this sacrilegious rivalry of the dead. Her memory entirely acquitted her of such offence; yet, still her heart persisted in reproaching her for the involuntary crime of attracting another suitor. Tobias, from being an object of perfect indifference, became gradually elevated to one of decided dislike, if not antipathy. As she wandered on, her mind naturally strayed into the regions of the past, and recalled, with unfailing accuracy, every incident calculated to revivify those deep-rooted impressions of sorrow, that happily for the stricken deer of this world, when softened by time, and assuaged by resignation, exercise a sort of fascination, which, while it incites to new indulgence, carries like the bee some honey with its sting. She returned home in her usual quiet mood. The waters had been indeed rudely ruffled, but were now calm, not only on the surface, but in the depths below. When she met her father, he kissed her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-398.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] forehead tenderly. Neither spoke a word of what had just passed, and the subject was not resumed until events about to be related caused it to be once more revived. Symptoms of Trouble---The Church in Danger---An Apparition Appears, Disappears, and Is never Seen again---A Fatal Accident--- A Conversation and a Death---The Pagan's Offering---Old Servants, Old Friends---A Sonnet. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-399.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] Hitherto our pilgrims, though on the frontier of the civilized world, and directly in the route from Canada to the colonies of New England, had escaped the ravages of Indian hostility. They had purchased the lands they occupied from the original proprietors at a price which, though it may now appear totally inadequate to their value, was at that time a fair equivalent. It is the labor of man that gives value to the earth; and to the roaming tenants of the uncultivated wilds, whose claims could not be said to be founded on possession, the relinquishment of a small portion was of little consequence. The early settlers of this country have been accused by philanthropists, whose zeal outruns their knowledge, of having robbed the Indians of their lands. But such was not the case. The condition of all the early grants of public lands for immediate settlement was the purchase of the Indian rights; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-400.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] and it must be obvious to all reflecting minds, that in the first stages of colonization, the weakness of the colonists was such as to preclude all acquisitions by force. The friendship of the savages was indispensable to every new settlement, and for a long period they were made either by fair purchase, or by consent of the Indians. When, in process of time, owing to causes which seem inseparable from the contact of the civilized and savage man, wars ensued between the two races, the right of conquest, recognized, if not by the law of nature at least by the practice of all civilized as well as savage nations, became applicable here as well as elsewhere; and it was then that lands were acquired at the price, not of money, but blood. The remoteness and obscurity of the scenes and times render it difficult to decide which party was the first aggressor; but it would be in opposition to all reason and experience to presume that while the whiteman continued the weaker party, he would wantonly provoke the hostility of the stronger, and thus ensure his own destruction. The aborigines of this country are notoriously a jealous, as well as a revengeful race; and so soon as they began to comprehend the truth, that the progress of the whitemen involved their own certain fate, from that moment they determined to repel or exterminate the intruders. It was at this period that the conviction seems to have become general among the savages of New England, who had formed a general confederacy to annihilate the race of the whiteman, and by a single blow [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-401.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] free themselves from all apprehension of the consequences which they foresaw awaited them; accordingly the plan was matured with a secrecy almost miraculous, and the moment appointed for striking the blow. One Sabbath day, when the little congregation had gathered together according to custom with their weapons at hand---for danger accompanied them in the fields as well as in the house of prayer---when the auditors were about to offer up their grateful acknowledgments to the Giver of all good, and when the good pastor was fervently inculcating the peaceful doctrines of the Saviour of mankind, the shrill war-whoop sounded the knell of death in their ears, and called their thoughts from heaven to earth. The men seized their arms and rushed forth only to encounter a band of painted warriors, who set upon them with savage fury. They were taken by surprize, and thrown into confusion; their efforts were without concert, for the military experience of Harold was inapplicable to Indian warfare, and consequently ineffectual. The savages gradually gained ground, and neared the church, where the women and children were awaiting their fate in trembling apprehension, the whitemen were on the point of retreating to the sacred asylum, there to make a last effort, and the fate of all, wives, children, friends, everything dear hung on the moment, when suddenly there appeared among them an aged man, with long white beard, and head whitened with the snows of many winters, who called on them in a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-402.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] voice that seemed accustomed to obedience, and arrested their retreat. His appearance awed the savages, and for a brief space arrested their efforts. "Will the champions of the true faith," cried he in a loud voice, "flee before the children of Satan? Stop--- turn---and fight the good fight for your wives, your children, and your God! Follow me!" The old man placed himself at the head of the wavering troop, and ere the awe-struck savages recovered from their dismay, arranged his little band with martial skill, and led them on to victory. The affrighted barbarians soon fled before what they believed a supernatural being; and when the battle was gained, the old man disappeared as suddenly as he came. He was never seen again, and none knew what became of him. It was the last appearance of one who had sat in judgment on a king. Previous to the confusion which had been arrested by the vision of the old man with the white beard, Harold, who had stood foremost in the fight, was knocked down and tomahawked, by a savage who came behind him unawares. Miriam saw him fall, and, in spite of all opposition, rushed out, and raising his head from the ground, supported him in her arms, while she endeavored to staunch the blood that flowed from a deep wound in his back between the shoulders. When the fight was over, he was borne to his home, insensible from loss of blood, followed by his weeping daughter. He was brought to himself by slow degrees, but it was only to become sensible that his wound was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-403.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] mortal. Yet he lived several days, supporting, with manly resignation, those pains of body only equalled by those of his mind. The thought of leaving his lonely, friendless child in this remote, exposed region without a protector, and among those who shared not a drop of her kindred blood, smote sorely on his heart, though his piety persuaded him he might safely leave her to the protection of Heaven. When he beheld that dutiful and loving child, who he knew was heavily laden with sorrows of her own, forgetting herself as if she had no being; hovering over him by day and by night, like a ministering angel, anticipating his wants, administering to his wound, and soothing him with soft commiseration, his heart smote him deeply that but for him she might now have one to protect and cherish her when he was gone. In the midst of these painful recollections and forebodings, he one day, shortly before he died, recalled to mind the proposal of Tobias Harpsfield, and determined to make one more effort in his behalf, rather than leave his daughter thus alone in the world. "Daughter," said he to Miriam, who was sitting in the breathless calm of speechless anxiety, watching him as these painful thoughts passed over his mind, "Daughter, thou knowest we are soon to part for ever in this world, to meet, I trust, hereafter in a better. Art thou prepared for the trial?" "Father," replied she, "I have been taught, and hope I have learned, submission to the will of Heaven." "True, Miriam; thou hast answered like a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-404.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] Christian. But I am about to leave thee here in this wilderness alone and unprotected, save by thy innocence and piety; and though I have especial trust in these, I own I should die more assured and happy if I could leave thee under the protection of some worthy husband, like Master Tobias Harpsfield." "Father!" exclaimed Miriam, in dismay. "Nay, hear me, Miriam. I once before told thee I regretted most deeply my stern, and, I will add, bigotted opposition to the dearest wishes of thy heart. When I recall the past, I can find no fault with Langley Tyringham. But he is now dead, and---" "But his memory did not die with him, dear father," interrupted Miriam; "I, at least, will never forget him." "But his memory will not protect thee when I am gone." "Heaven will protect me," said she, casting her eyes upwards; "a better protector by far than an unworthy, selfish husband. But, dear father, do not let the few last hours we are permitted to pass together be embittered by a subject on which we never can agree. I have thus far kept my pledge never to wed without thy consent, and humbly urge that filial duty can justly require no greater test of obedience. Oh! leave me---I beseech thee, leave me to the fulfilment of another vow I made to poor Langley at parting, which I hold equally sacred---that of fidelity to the memory of the only man that ever awakened me to the conviction that there was another feeling stronger and more enduring than even filial love." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-405.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] "Well, daughter, be it so. Thou hast made a great sacrifice to me---I will make a lesser one to thee. In these last moments of my life, I hope I have recovered what I too often lost, the peaceful empire over myself. Let the subject be at rest. I will trust thy innocence to One who, if He does not always shield it here, will assuredly reward it hereafter. Remember always, Miriam, that it is better to suffer than to merit suffering; that there is no shield for innocence like innocence itself and no balm for sorrow like patience and resignation. I will trust thee to Heaven." Miriam earnestly begged forgiveness for opposing his wishes, adding--- "Even could I forget my vow to Langley, I could never have consented to wed Tobias Harpsfield. Believe me, my father, he is equally unworthy of thee and thine. I have indeed but little experience in the world, but I have lived with those who taught me to know the look and language of sincerity, and my heart has communed with one who was the soul of honor and the mirror of truth. I have seen into the secret heart of this bad man, and believe me, father, he is a hypocrite and a villain. I would rather suffer the Indian tortures of scalp and fire than wed with that man. But, dear father, let not my selfish sorrows weary thee." "No, daughter; and, if thou did, a few hours more or less of life are only a few sands of the hour-glass. I have something else to say before I have done." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-406.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] He then briefly informed her that he had long ago made his will; that, being now of age, she would have the sole disposal of his property; and that the good pastor had promised his kind offices whenever she required protection or advice. He enjoined her to look to him as a parent on all occasions, and giving her a paternal kiss, desired to be left alone awhile, as he felt exhausted and drowsy. He fell asleep, but never waked more, and was found about an hour afterwards dead, with his hands folded on his breast, and his eyes cast upwards. The good man---for such he was with all his bigotry---was buried by the side of his faithful helpmate, and accompanied to the grave by all his neighbors with sad decorum. Among the rest was an Indian, who had become attached to Harold by many acts of kindness, and who greatly scandalized the good Puritans by casting his pipe and bow and arrows into the grave. "Let them remain," said the good pastor, "it is the offering of gratitude." The grief of the bereaved daughter was a silent grief, and her tears were shed in solitude. She became more pale than ever, and her form lost much of that graceful roundness which gives such harmony to the human figure. There might be seen after this event a slight expression of that stern determination, with which the well-poised spirit braces itself to meet the stormy wave of rough calamity. This, however, gradually disappeared, and her face once more assumed that calm, resigned, and beautiful expression, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-407.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] forms the mirror of a soul innocent of remorse, yet not exempt from sorrow. The faithful Mildred, fast descending into the vale of years, was now her only domestic companion, or rather friend; for long and faithful services elevate the character of a menial into that of a friend. So thought rare Ben Jonson, when he addressed a sonnet to an old servant, who became afterwards a respectable dramatic writer, as follows:---"To my faithful servant, and (by his continued virtue) my loving friend, Mr. Richard Broome." Miriam Alone in the World---The Good Pastor Falls Asleep in His Pulpit---One of Job's Comforters---A Suitor Non-suited before Commencing His Suit---New Lords, New Laws, and New Emigrants--- Consequences. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-408.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] Miriam was now alone in the wilderness; and like Logan, there was not a drop of kindred blood flowing in the veins of any human being breathing in the New World. She was without any stay but the tempered energies of her own mind, strengthened by a firm reliance on the protection of Heaven. The benevolent shepherd of the little flock to whose care she had been recommended by her dying parent, assisted her with his advice, and consoled her with his sympathy. On the settlement of her affairs, she found herself in a situation not only to supply all her own wants, but to administer to the necessities of others, when occasion required. It was not often, indeed; for beggary was not then in fashion, and it was thought much better to labor for support, than to derive it from the labors of others. There was but one pauper in the community, and she was a stranger. When the silent grief of a deeply-wounded spirit, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-409.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] had begun to feel the balmy influence of the old greybeard comforter, Time, Miriam, though she might not be called happy, was far from being miserable. Her recollections of the past were unaccompanied by remorse; her present situation was surrounded by the simple comforts which money could command in that remote region; and the future was brightened by a hope beyond the grave. Her habits of industry were now a never-failing resource; she never felt the pressure of unoccupied time, that deadly nightmare which poisons the existence of those favored mortals, the envy of their fellow-creatures, who undergo ten times more labor in search of pleasure, than the poor man does in search of bread; and find harder work in killing time than others do in employing it usefully. In her hours of contemplation, she was never alone, for her thoughts dwelt on objects, which though not always present, yet ever and anon, returned in the semblance of departed friends, who dead to the world, seemed to live for her alone. She became at length so familiarized to these contemplations, that instead of paining, they soothed her heart, and she would not have exchanged them for joy and gladness. Their shadows ever appeared with approving smiles, not frowning scowls, as if reproaching her with some past offence; and when this is the case, the memory of the past, though it may be peopled with lost friends, brings with it a soothing, gentle pleasure, that may well compare with the delusive dreams of hope. Wretched, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-410.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] indeed, are those who dare not look backwards, for the future can afford them little consolation for the past. Thus months passed away with little incident, and less variety. But this calm was at length ruffled by an event of passing interest to the Pilgrim band. The faithful shepherd, who had led his flock into the lonely wilderness, and watched and prayed for their welfare; whose advice had directed, and whose example guided them in all the vicissitudes of their course, was suddenly and without warning called away by the great accountant, who sooner or later brings all mankind to a reckoning. To some he gives a short credit of a few hours, or months; to others he allows a longer period; and to a few, some fourscore years, or upwards. But they must pay at last; and when they think he has forgotten, or rubbed out the score, appears on a sudden like some pale officer, and lodges them in that narrow cell, wherein no air can blow. One Sabbath morning, just as the good man was giving his blessing to his flock, he fell back in his pulpit, and word spake nevermore. His last breath was spent in prayer, and his last word was a benediction. His death threw a gloom over all around, for he never discouraged innocent mirth, delighted in seeing smiling faces, and did not believe it necessary to live in the perpetual gloom of present night, in order to enjoy the brightness of the future day. Here was the last staff broken, and poor Miriam had no earthly prop to lean upon, but an aged woman, kind and affectionate indeed, from long habit; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-411.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] possessing a narrow mind, incapable of sympathizing with hers. It was at this period, too, that she began to be again pestered with the visits of Tobias Harpsfield, who, notwithstanding his former rebuff, still continued to calculate that she would be an excellent speculation. He had taken great pains to ascertain precisely what she was worth, and watched with the patience of a beast of prey to see how, one by one, all those who would protect or defend his victim, were called away from her. He had a high opinion of perseverance, and was accustomed to say, that he who held out to the last would always win. Accordingly, having waited "a decent time," as he expressed it--- for decency was his moral creed---he recommenced his devoirs, by calling on a visit of condolence, of all visits the most irksome to the receiver, when paid by one who feels no sympathy. "Ah," quoth Tobias, casting up his greygoose eyes, "ah! he was a good man---an excellent man---a tender husband, an affectionate parent, a kind neighbor, and a pious believer. Such a loss can never be repaired; it is worse than that of your excellent mother. You will never get such another father. But though left alone in the world without a friend or relation, you should not despair, for there are thousands and tens of thousands in this world a great deal worse off than you, who have wherewithal to support yourself handsomely and ride in your own carriage, with two horses, if you choose." This was about the sum total of the consolations of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-412.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] philosophy, according to the creed of Tobias, who was one of that very numerous class who think money not only a great blessing, but one equivalent to the absence of all others. Miriam received and listened to him with loathing. With the sure instinct of woman she saw into his heart, the sole animating principle of which was a grovelling selfishness, not merely confined to a preference of his own gratification above that of all others, but to the exclusion of the rest of the world. Still, the alleged kindness, of his motive for this visit forbade her treating him with downright incivility, and Tobias departed quite satisfied that he had broken the ice very successfully, though if he had read her countenance he would have groaned in spirit, and gnashed his teeth. But the truth is, he was so completely absorbed by his own selfish purposes, that he forgot everything besides. He studied only in his own book, and never looked into the pages of others. Following up this auspicious commencement, Tobias repeated his visits, gradually shortening the intervals between them, until his persecution became almost intolerable. There was no getting rid of him; for in these matter-of-fact days, the last thing thought of would have been to instruct a servant in the art of lying, by denying the master or mistress when actually at home. The upright, punctilious Mildred would have scorned such a mission. Nor was this all. Miriam could not take a walk, morning, noon, or evening, without what Tobias called a chance meeting; and if she staid at home, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-413.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] he had ever some clumsy excuse for calling. He watched her going to church, or waylaid her in returning; accompanied her home; and in short, so managed matters, that at length the neighbors began to compliment Miriam on her conquest in a sly way, and ask her "when it was to be." This tickled Tobias mightily, for he thought there must be something in it, as everybody seemed to be of the same opinion. He was a cunning, but not a wise man. Perseverance will carry the day at last, thought he, as he was proceeding on his daily visit with a full resolution to try his fortune once more. Now it so happened, that on that very morning Miriam had been for the second time complimented by a knowing old dame, a near neighbor, who took particular cognizance of other people's affairs---on her approaching wedding. Heavens! how her heart swelled with indignant sorrow at the idea of such a suecessor to Langley. It was not to be borne; and though the discreet Tobias had as yet never repeated his proposal, or given her a fair opportunity for discarding him, she at once resolved to take it without it being given, though it was rather an awkward business to nonsuit one who had not actually commenced his suit. She was in the height of her indignation, when Tobias walked in without knocking---for he affected to be very intimate---and full of his purpose to try his fortune a second time. He had wrought himself up to the crisis---he had cleared his throat by a vigorous "hem," and warmed his icy soul by a vision of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-414.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] dower, when Miriam anticipated his purpose, by meeting him considerably more than half way. She began by referring to her peculiar situation, as a single woman, without father or mother, and living almost alone; to the delicate proprieties such a situation imposed; to his frequent visits, and constant intrusion everywhere; and finally, with a flushed cheek and flashing eye, bespeaking mingled modesty and loathing, she alluded to the reports which his conduct had produced. Tobias sat with open ears, eyes, and mouth, anticipating a prosecution for breach of promise, after the fashion of New England spinsters, if he did not forthwith offer her his hand. What then was his astonishment and dismay, when he was saluted with a peremptory request, which sounded very much like a demand, that he would at once, and forever, discontinue his visits; forbear all further attentions, and consider himself a perfect stranger in future. The revulsion of his feelings was terribly bitter. He was taken by surprise; replied not a word; and departed without taking leave, filled with anger, malice, and revenge. While the disastrous courtship of Master Tobias Harpsfield had been progressing backwards, various changes highly important to the destinies of our little community occurred. New accessions of settlers had come; various improvements had been made or suggested by certain troublesome and mischievous busybodies, called "public-spirited citizens;" and the body politic, inflated with its self-importance, began to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-415.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] aspire to the dignity of an incorporation. This notion was fostered, if not originally engendered, by certain leading men, who thought they had undoubted claim to official distinction. The whole project was, however, knocked on the head for the present by a shrewd old deacon, who warned the good people that a charter was only a cunning device to enable the corporation to run in debt without paying, and plunder the community under color of law. A new judge had been appointed, who, coming direct from the oldest but one town in the State, was looked up to with sinful reverence; and to crown all, a new pastor had been called from the midst of the witches, who began about this time again to play their diabolical pranks at Naumkeag, and elsewhere. He was accompanied by a number of disciples, enamored of his doctrines and preaching. These innovations and innovators brought with them the seeds of much after disturbance, and caused a deal of mischief, as well as misery. The new arrivals, judge, pastor and flock, were, without exception, devout believers in witchcraft, coming as they did from the very focus of witchendom. Such a delusion might seem strange, had it not been cherished in every age and nation of the world. It has been ridiculed as an error of superstition and ignorance; but to this day, so far as we know, it has never been philosophically treated, nor has any attempt been made to demonstrate its incompatibility with nature, reason, philosophy and science. At this moment there exists among a large portion of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-416.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] mankind, the latent seeds of that same delusion, which, in the age of which we are speaking, produced such deplorable examples of the weakness of reason, the strength and ferocity of fear. Happily, though tolerated by the pulpit, in compliment to the Witch of Endor, it is repudiated by the law, and its punishment is now founded not in its reality, but its nonexistence. The course of our story leads to a revival of these times, and the reference is made with no view to reflect on a race of men whose integrity, piety, and heroism were amply sufficient to atone for all their faults and weaknesses. The records of past ages are equally useful, as affording examples to imitate or avoid; and it cannot be denied, that in the present age, the credulity of science is quite equal to that of ignorance in days of yore. The reign of superstition, if we do not err, if it has ever gone by, is about to be revived; and witchcraft and necromancy seem destined to assume the dignity of sciences. It is well for the professors of mesmerism they did not practice their impositions some two centuries ago, for they would assuredly have been brought to the stake or the gallows. Though unhappily at that time recognized as genuine, by men whose piety and learning were equal to any of their cotemporaries, it was a species of witchcraft of the most vulgar species, and had in it nothing of the vague sublimity of the invisible world. It consisted entirely in physical inflictions, or practical jokes [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-417.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] carried to extremes, such as sticking pins, throwing stones, playing pranks with furniture, and other petty annoyances, altogether beneath the dignity of supernatural agency. It was in fact the sublime of the ridiculous, and would have been the broadest of farces, had it not ended in the deepest of tragedies. The gambols of superstition are like the festivals of the savages, where human victims are offered up to flames and torture. Like the fabled Ogre, its gigantic deformity would excite only contempt and scorn, did it not prey on human flesh, and banquet on human blood. It was not long after the arrival of the new reinforcement to the settlement, before it began to be whispered that witchcraft was abroad among them. Many strange things happened, or were said to happen, which could not be accounted for in a natural way. Invisible hands perpetrated invisible outrages, such as pelting honest people with stones at night; setting the frying pans to ringing profane and diabolical tunes; upsetting milk pans; bewitching the tongs, so that it opened when it ought to have shut, and shut when it should have opened; together with various other mischievous devices, such as witches practice as it were without any other object than the gratification of a perverse, malignant spirit. In cases of this kind, there can be little doubt, that the love of mischief incites many persons to perpetrate various pranks, or that others wreak their secret spite under the cover of the prevailing delusion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-418.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] Tobias Harpsfield was among the early victims of fiendish malignity. He now first began to luxuriate in the conception of a plot which time will develope; and it behooved him to spread the infection of witchcraft by every means in his power. Accordingly, there was not a night passed that, if you would believe him, he was not grievously assaulted or persecuted, by one or more of these invisible demons. Sometimes he would be aroused by a box on the ear; sometimes while sitting at a window, it would come slamming down on his head; at one time his hat was blown off, though there was not a breath of air stirring; at others he heard horrible bursts of laughter close to his ear while saying his prayers; and more than once he was waked up at night by the sticking of pins, though as yet he could find none in his flesh, nor detect any mark of the infliction. People began to stare and wonder at Tobias; he had become a subject of supernatural agency, and partook in the awful and mysterious dignity of his persecutors. Thus he continued for a time to feed the growing panic, until a few recent examples of perverse action in this matter caused him to apprehend that he might, by some strange process of reasoning, be converted from a victim into an accomplice, and from this time his persecutions miraculously ceased. Progress of a Panic---Ingenious Device of Master Tobias Harpsfield for Winning a Wife---Description of a First-Rate Witch---Miriam Accused of Witchcraft. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-419.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] The progress of a panic is like that of a pestilence. It is conceived in obscurity; it walketh in darkness, and is communicated from one to another by a process equally rapid and inscrutable. No sooner had the apprehension of witchcraft fastened on the minds of the people, than its existence became hourly demonstrated by new and extraordinary appearances. The human mind delights in the wonderful, and there is a period in the progress of terror which affords a strange gratification. Thus every day brought forth new evidence of witchcraft. The weak, the superstitious, the mischievous and the designing, all united in contributions to the common stock, until a mass of facts, sufficient to overwhelm the most skeptical, was accumulated. Reports without father or mother, and coming from no one knew whither, followed at the heels of each other. At one time there came a tale of a woman living at a sufficient distance to afford space for rumors to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-420.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] expatiate in, who, in the phrase of the time, "Belched out nefarious blasphemies," without moving her tongue; next came the rumor of a man being beaten almost to death by an invisible fist; another was bruised black and blue with corn cobs, and had his barn set on fire by means he could not discover; another, in going into his field, was saluted with a shower of stones that knocked him down and bruised him sorely, though no marks could be seen on his body; another had his milk skimmed every night, and his cheese turned into buttermilk. But this was not the worst; a select man, famous for "devotion, sanctity and gravity, was murdered with an hideous witchcraft;" and to cap the climax of rumors, little children "fell into fits that carried with them something diabolical." In short, there was no cessation to these reports of wonders, that, even if true, might have been easily accounted for without resorting to supernatural agency. As yet, however, the public suspicion had not concentrated itself on any one particular object. But fear is nearly allied to cruelty, and must have its victims. We may perhaps trace much of the blood shed by tyrants to their apprehensions of the people. Old, ugly, and decrepid women, though at other times neglected and forgotten, are sure to figure in the van when witchcraft is rife in the land. The more poor, helpless, and, above all, ugly and decrepid, the greater the probability in the mind of a philosophical adept in the science, that they have entered into a compact with the arch enemy, not for the rational purpose of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-421.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] improving their own condition, but merely to obtain the power of tormenting little children, by way of amusement. Just at the base of the mountain heretofore spoken of, and about a mile from the village, dwelt an aged Dutch woman, who had, when quite young, been captured by the Indians of the Manhadoes in one of their incursions; and through a series of strange vicissitudes, not altogether uncommon in those days of veritable romance, found her way at length to the little settlement, where she was permitted to build a hut, on the skirts of a wood that clothed the base of the mountain. She had resided here a twelvemonth or more, with no companion but a cat, the color of which it is impossible to state positively, at this distance of time. None knew how she lived, and the reason was, none cared, except Miriam, who could have explained the mystery had she chosen. This old vrouw was eminently qualified for a witch, having not the least pretensions to beauty. Homely in her youth, the hardships and exposures endured in the progress of her captivity among the savages, together with the deep scar of a tomahawk across her cheek, had given her face a savage expression, exceedingly harsh and disagreeable. Besides this, she lived alone with her cat, and apparently shunned all communication with her fellow-creatures. The natural conclusion was, that her principal associates were among the spirits of darkness. In fine, she was old, ugly, and poor; her dialect was a farrago of Dutch, Indian, and English; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-422.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] she walked with a stick, was almost bent double, and had a cat. Could any one doubt her vocation? One of the extraordinary features of witchcraft is the agency of young children, at least such was the case here. They were among the principal, and sometimes the only witnesses, on whose testimony more than one person was condemned to death and executed, at different places, during the prevalence of this moral pestilence. Whether these children were themselves the dupes of their own fears or fancy, or tutored by others more artful than themselves; or whether they were instigated by the vanity of making themselves the objects of universal wonder, cannot be known at this day. But strange as may be either of these suppositions, they are not half so improbable as that they were really under the influence of supernatural agency. Be this as it may, about this time a pair of these little imps, who were unquestionably under some evil influence or other, became infected with the mania. They fell into strange convulsions, uttered equally strange exclamations, and indulged in divers inimitable contortions, during the intervals of which they would cry out, that the Old Cat---as the old woman, whose name was Catalina, was generally called---was either scratching, or choking, or sticking pins into them. Having repeated this execrable farce several times, with additional extravagances, the magistrates being made acquainted with the facts, assembled together, and after grave deliberation, decided to have Old Cat [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-423.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] apprehended, and brought before them for examination. Accordingly, the devoted old woman made her debut in charge of three constables, two of whom had been expressly installed for this purpose, as no single one of them was hardy enough to venture alone into her premises. After hearing the accusation, of which the poor old creature scarcely comprehended one word, she was strictly interrogated on the subject, and poured forth an unintelligible jargon of Dutch, Indian, and broken English, at which the worshipful bench was utterly confounded. They understood no more of her defence than she did of the accusation, and solved the mystery by pronouncing it the language of the devil, without a dissenting voice. She was then confronted with her supposed victims, who were seized with still more violent paroxysms in her presence, and this being deemed decisive, she was committed to prison to await her trial at an early day. It was at this crisis, that Master Tobias Harpsfield thought he perceived a fair opportunity of either revenging himself for his double dismissal, or forcing Miriam into his arms for protection. He had been meditating his plan for some months, and gradually familiarized himself to its mean, malignant atrocity; for every time the idea of meditated guilt occurs to the mind, it comes shorn of some of its most revolting features. His plan was to cause the poor, unprotected girl to be accused of witchcraft, which would certainly result in one of two consequences. Either [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-424.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] she would become an object of universal fear and abhorrence, or be committed to prison for trial. In either case, by friendly attentions, by interfering in her behalf, and procuring her release in the last extremity, as he had no doubt he could, he might so work on her gratitude, if not her affections, that she would be ultimately wrought upon to give him her hand, which being well filled, he coveted most egregiously. Thus the wily deceiver deceived himself; for little did he anticipate the tenacity with which the fatal sisters, Bigotry and Superstition, would cling to their victims. But being a man of great weight and influence both in Church and State, he flattered himself that his interference could at any time be successful, and his first step was procuring an interview with Old Cat, which he did without difficulty, though the jailer looked at him with astonishment, and ever after quoted him as a model of heroism, in thus venturing alone into the presence of a veritable imp of Satan. He found the desolate old crone smoking the stump of a short black pipe, though this was in direct contravention of the regulations of the prison. But she insisted, and the jailer was fain to comply, least she should exercise some of her diabolical art on his person. By her side sate the cat, which had followed to the jail, and entered with her, in spite of the opposition of the said jailer, which, however, was not very energetic, as he was extremely shy of what he verily believed was the Familiar Spirit. Tobias, having occasionally visited New Amsterdam in his speculating excursions, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-425.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] had picked up a smattering of Dutch, which aided by his knowledge of some Indian dialects acquired while a trader, enabled him to understand, and be understood by the old woman---originally without education, and having nearly lost all perception of the distinction between right and wrong, by years of miserable sojourn among savages, who could teach her little but rapine and murder, the poor creature was but a passive instrument in the hands of the tempter. He first worked on her fears, by assuring her she would be burnt alive, with such tortures as she had seen the savages inflict on their prisoners; and having thus frightened her almost out of her wits, cautiously insinuated that the only possible mode of escaping this terrible fate was, to accuse some person of having betwitched her, by which means she might cast the guilt from her own head on that of another. It is equally painful and disgusting to trace, step by step, the arts of a cunning and malicious villain; and without proceeding any further in detail, or specifying by what windings the serpent at length circumvented his prey, it will be sufficient to say, that by practising alternately on her fears of punishment and hope of reward, he succeeded in bringing the poor stultified being to his purposes. The plan was quite simple. When brought to trial, she was to pretend to fall into convulsions, howl like the savages, and ever and anon screech forth the name of Miriam Habingdon, as the instrument of all her sufferings. Alas! for human nature! Miriam was her benefactress. In justice, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-426.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] however, to Old Cat, she demurred stoutly to this last act of the farce, until Tobias solemnly assured her he would take especial care that no harm should happen to the young lady. Thus tutored, and having thoroughly learned and practiced her lesson, Old Cat was in good time brought forth for trial. In her progress from the jail to the room in which the court was sitting, she performed all sorts of violent antics; imitated the most extravagant gestures of the savages in their dances, their shouts, and their howlings; and after going through a series of almost supernatural contortions, ever and anon screeched forth the name of Miriam Habingdon, who, she said, was thus tormenting her. The court was brought to a stand; the spectators stood aghast at this denunciation of one hitherto believed of so blameless a life, so innocent of all offence against her fellow-creatures. Hitherto the accusations of witchcraft had been confined to persons of suspicious character and low station, whose habits of life or obscurity of position afforded at least some pretext for persecution. But now it seemed that the great enemy of man was aiming at higher conquests, and that none might expect to escape his snares. The panic became more intense; and that purity of life and character which ought to have shielded Miriam from suspicion, only operated to raise her into an object of increasing horror; for such was the besotted state of the community, that had an angel descended from Heaven, his divine mission would scarcely have protected him from being mistaken for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-427.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] the Spirit of Darkness in disguise. The old woman was remanded to prison, rather as a witness than a criminal; and though the judges were neither brutes nor hypocrites, such was the delusion under which they labored, that after mature deliberation, a warrant was issued for the apprehension of Miriam Habingdon, on a charge of witchcraft. Miriam Examined before the Magistrates and Committed to Prison on the Evidence of Old Cat---Visit of Condolence by Tobias Harpsfield and its Consequences---Trial and Condemnation on the Testimony of the Devil. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-428.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] Our heroine was more astonished than dismayed on the receipt of a summons to attend the magistrates on a charge of witchcraft, a crime the existence of which she utterly disbelieved. Conscious of her innocence, she suffered herself to be led an unresisting victim, little aware that neither innocence would avail, or humanity interpose to shield her from a whirlwind that was sweeping down all the barriers of common sense, and human feeling. She appeared before the magistrates, with all the quiet self-possession of conscious innocence; but such was the revolution in public opinion which a few hours had produced, that a majority of the spectators pronounced her demeanor nothing more than a hardened insensibility, indicating the last hopeless stage of guilt. Schooled by Tobias Harpsfield, Old Cat, after a preliminary exhibition of writhings, screechings, contortions, and convulsions, told the usual tale of beating, pinching, strangling, and sticking pins, all which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-429.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] she ascribed to Miriam, who, though at these times invisible to others, she recognized as her tormentor. When this deplorable farce was concluded, the criminal being asked what she had to say in her defence, simply and solemnly protested her innocence, and concluded by suggesting the propriety of establishing the existence of witchcraft, before they punished the witches. This insinuation operated greatly against her, as it clearly indicated that both magistrates and people were equally under the influence of a delusion. This cut rather too deep. Already two victims had been sacrificed on the altar of superstition, and every mind revolted from the very possibility of their having been unjustly punished. It was necessary to believe, in order to quiet their consciences. In addition to this, one of the magistrates, who had specially distinguished himself in the crusade against witchcraft, felt himself personally insulted by this insinuation, which, moreover, savored of downright heresy. The belief in witchcraft had become in some measure a test of orthodoxy, being not only sustained by the example of the Witch of Endor, but by the precepts of the new pastor, who had come from the very hot-bed of witchcraft. Strange as it may seem, he was a liberal scholar and a pious divine, though deeply infected with bigotry, the besetting sin of that age. Without doubt he had a thorough conviction of the existence of witchcraft; but he deceived himself, and what is worse, he deceived others. In truth, such was the miserable infatuation that pervaded all classes, men, women, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-430.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] children, clergymen and magistrates, learned and ignorant, that while the panic raged, to be accused of witchcraft was the certain prelude to imprisonment or death. This terrible delusion led into a labyrinth of error and iniquity, which cannot be excused on any plea of sincerity; and, however unpalatable may be a reference to the subject, it should be for ever preserved in our remembrance as a solemn warning against superstition in all its forms, and under every disguise. It is a hideous, bloody, remorseless fiend, and with its twin-sister bigotry, richly merits an association with war, pestilence, and famine. The blamelessness of her past life, the solemn assertion of her innocence, the calm self-possession of her manner, availed nothing against the absurd declarations and extravagant contortions of the old woman, who really exhibited a pantomime that seemed to savor of supernatural suppleness and activity. Miriam was committed to prison, where she remained in solitude, avoided by all. Even Mildred, a firm believer in witchcraft, was afraid to come near her young mistress, lest she herself should be infected; and though she took good care to supply her with all she required, never ventured inside of the prison door. She had nursed Miriam from the cradle, loved her with all her heart, and it is probable would have died for her; but there was something in this diabolical communion so horribly revolting, that the pious old soul recoiled in disgust whenever she thought of her former nursling. Thus was poor Miriam deserted by all the little world [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-431.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] around her, and left with no other stay than that of conscious innocence. It was now that the very devout Tobias Harpsfield, who boasted that he had never laughed nor eaten a hot dinner on Sabbath day; who never violated, or at least was caught in violating the law; and who was approved by all his more respectable neighbors, a good man and a worthy citizen---it was now that he brought his machinery into play to win the last cast. He paid Miriam a visit, and such was the desolation of her soul, such the depression of the lonely and deserted maiden, such the feeling of utter abandonment that crushed her to the earth, that even his presence was not unwelcome. To the solitary prisoner, condemned to pass the livelong day in idleness, without a visitor, and without a resource except in melancholy thoughts of the past, or gloomy forebodings of what is to come, the presence of anything breathing of life is grateful. A spider weaving his web, or a mouse sporting in the silence of the scene, is hailed as a companion, where all around is one dread vacuity. During the interim between the committal and trial of Miriam, Tobias repeated his visits, confining himself to reflections on her situation, and suggestions of the best means for relief, without the slightest allusion to his ultimate object. Miriam began to believe he was indeed a friend, and her heart smote her for her former prejudices. At length being pressed for time, as the trial was now approaching, he took occasion to apprise her, with an air of peculiar satisfaction, that in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-432.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] the course of his indefatigable inquiries in her behalf he had, he believed, gained a clue, which, if properly followed up, would either result in her immediate release, or subsequent acquittal. Having thus awakened a hope, he indirectly and cautiously insinuated her forlorn and desolate situation, without parent, brother, or friend, other than himself; and concluded by suggesting, that under the avowed and lawful protection of a man of weight and influence in the community, especially in the church, she would undoubtedly be shielded from all further persecution. He was proceeding with all the caution of an experienced hunter, circling around his game and gradually approaching nearer and nearer; and had gone so far as to intimate he thought it possible, nay, was almost sure, he had sufficient influence over old Catalina to induce her to retract her absurd accusation. But Miriam, at once divining his purpose, suddenly interrupted him with deep emotion, exclaiming--- "Enough---enough, Master Harpsfield; I comprehend thee now! But I am already wedded---I belong to the dead. Spare me any more words on the subject. Thou hast been kind to me when no others showed me kindness, and I had become grateful. But I now see thine object, and to arrest it for ever,know that I had rather, ten times rather, meet the doom prepared for those accused of witchcraft, than pledge my faith to a man mean enough to take advantage of my wretched condition for his own selfish purposes. Spare me, I pray thee, and let me die in peace, if such is Heaven's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-433.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] decree. Death will not sever me from my world, but unite me to all I have loved here." Tobias departed, but not in despair. "The time,' thought he, "is not yet come. Even the weak and wicked defy death at a distance, believing themselves beyond reach of his dart. We shall see, when he stares her full in the face. The next time she shall ask me to marry her." The court was now convened, and the day at length came which was to decide the fate of the lonely orphan. The place was crowded with awe-stricken spectators, drawn thither by that strange fascination which terror exercises over the human mind. The magistrates took their seats on either hand of the presiding judge, and to give additional solemnity to this mockery of justice, the pastor of the flock, in his clerical robes, was complimented with a seat on the bench. The crime of witchcraft was considered of a mixed nature, involving an offence as well against the civil as the ecclesiastical law, and more properly under the jurisdiction of the spiritual courts. But nothing of this kind existed here, and criminals of this class were left to the civil authority. Miriam appeared with all the calm confidence of conscious innocence, though trembling with that deadly weakness, which is the result of a long harrassed mind, sinking under its own resistance of calamity. After the old woman had gone through another rehearsal of her lesson, and detailed all the stupendous absurdities of her story, in a language which added new [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-434.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] horrors to the tale, by its obscurity, Miriam was permitted to cross-examine her. She calmly questioned her as to their previous intercourse, and her own objects in visiting the hut. But here Old Cat could neither understand or be understood. She answered only by a mixed jargon of all the dialects of which she had a smattering, and which was again pronounced by the hearers to be the language of the Evil Spirit himself. When called on for her defence, the mind of Miriam rose with the occasion, and there suddenly shone forth over her face an expression of sublime innocence, visible to all, but which, in these besotted times, was held to be only one of the cunning expedients of the Great Tempter to impose on the people, hoodwink the eyes of justice, and screen his bondslaves from merited punishment. She spoke like one inspired; she sketched the character of her parents, their sufferings and their exile for their faith, together with her own education and habits of life, and concluded as follows--- "As for my occasional visits to that poor, mistaken, or misled woman---though aware that errands of benevolence should be in secret---I feel now called upon to declare that they were visits of charity. The precepts of my parents taught me there were occasions when the right hand should not know the doings of the left; but there are also occasions, I trust, when good deeds may be brought forward to meet unjust accusations. I sought this woman, not to exercise over her that power which, I believe, was never yet delegated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-435.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] to the wicked, here the pastor threw up his eyes and hands---"but to administer to her necessities by such relief as they seemed to require. I do not know whether she is herself deceived, or is deceiving others. I do not know whether she is the instrument of her own depraved heart, or of some one still more depraved. There is but one person living"---and here she cast her eyes on Tobias Harpsfield, who was present---"I at least know of but one person living whom I have offended. But I accuse no one, because I have nothing but suspicion to support my accusation. If innocent, God pardon my suspicions---if guilty, God pardon him." Here Tobias twitched his eyebrows a little, but stood his ground manfully---"I would not unjustly accuse him, but I cannot but see the hand of some one more cunning than this wretched woman, in this plot against my life and my good name. Whoever it may be, that hath thus selected from all the rest of the world a desolate orphan, standing alone among strangers, without a friend above ground, save one who is above all, as the object of a loathsome calumny, I do not envy him his feelings, though he may succeed in bringing me to a disgraceful death, a memory abhorred by all, and subject me, while living, to imprisonment, derision, and disgrace." Here Tobias was seized with a sudden bleeding at the nose, and placing his handkerchief to his nostrils, departed in haste. "But," continued Miriam---"I feel that my days of humiliation and sorrow are drawing to a close, and that I am about to become one of the many [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-436.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] victims of men bewildered by the strange revelations of a fantastic madness, which, when it subsides, will cause all those who have dipped their hands in blood at its bidding, to shudder at the recollection. I can but solemnly declare I am innocent---I have no witnesses to prove it, but Him who sees and knows all things, even the deepest secrets of the heart. If acquitted, I shall be grateful; if condemned, I shall hope hereafter for that mercy denied me here." As she concluded, the pastor, a weak, but well-meaning man, deeply infected with the mania of the times, said to the magistrates in an under tone--- "Verily how artfully Satan can clothe his followers, even so as to convert the blackness of guilt into the whiteness of innocence. Of a truth, it is high time to be stirring, when the spirits of darkness walk forth among us in the disguise of spirits of light." When such was the prevailing sentiment of all present, it is needless to say, that the innocent girl was pronounced guilty of witchcraft, and ordered for execution at the expiration of a brief period, lest she should indulge a spirit of vengeance at the expense of the community. Miriam was silent; she cast her eyes towards Heaven, folded her arms across her bosom, and bowed submissively, as she was led back to prison. There being some difference of opinion in the Court, as to the final disposal of Old Cat, she was, greatly to her disgust and disappointment, also remanded to jail. She had been assured by Tobias, that her discharge would take place immediately on the condemnation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-437.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] of Miriam, and, for his own sake, he had earnestly exerted himself to make good his promise. But on application to the magistrates he found to his equal surprise and dismay, that though they had received her testimony against the life of another, they still believed her possessed, and consequently had condemned poor Miriam to death, on the evidence of the Devil. The Self-punishment of the Guilty---An Apparition---Exorcism of Mildred who Joins in Accusing her Young Mistress of Witchcraft--- The Ghost Vanishes suddenly, but shortly Appears again to Miriam--- Particulars of the Interview. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-438.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] Tobias Harpsfield , when he found that he had totally failed in his matrimonial schemes, and forced Miriam into the grave instead of the bridal bed, began to feel the consequences which never fail to follow in the track of guilt, even in this world. Though mean, selfish and revengeful, his depravity had never contemplated reaching the life of his victim; and when, after exerting all his influence in her behalf in vain, the conviction came over him, that her fate could only be averted by a miracle, his conscience, not yet sufficiently hardened to the guilt of blood, became his accuser and his torment. Though not actually intentional, still the crime was the direct consequence of acts that he had wilfully committed; and with all the ingenuity of his self-love, he could not disguise from himself the bitter truth, that he was responsible for all consequences. To these feelings of compunction was added the apprehension of being betrayed by Old [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-439.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] Cat, who finding his promise of release was not fulfilled, might, and probably would, in revenge for the disappointment, make a full confession. Thus assailed on one hand by the sting of guilt, on the other by the fear of discovery, he found no rest by day or by night, and suffered far more than his innocent victim. He continued to use every effort in behalf of Miriam, still cherishing a hope that if convinced she owed her life to him, gratitude might bestow what love had denied. But all his exertions failed to relax the stern decree of bigotry, and those arts which had hitherto enabled him to compass his evil designs, failed to accomplish his good ones. The panic had now reached its crisis; every day brought forth new rumors, new cases, and new accusations; imposture became more bold and reckless; dupes increased with the number of victims; and in proportion to the extravagance of the charges was the credulity of superstition which swallowed every absurdity. A state of feeling existed, which, had it not so often been exhibited in the history of men, would be deemed incredible. Many of the accused had confessed their guilt, in the hope of pardon, or possibly in the full belief that they were actually possessed; and it was considered infallible proof of the truth of the accusations, that they tallied exactly with the confessions. These were taken down by reverend men, who, instead of exerting their influence in allaying the ferment, prostituted it to the purposes of superstition and cruelty. There is reason to believe that in many cases these confessions [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-440.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] were greatly exaggerated by those who recorded them. and who at the same time, sought to give these stupendous absurdities, the stamp of truth, by reciting texts from holy writ to their purposes. They seized on the panic as a favorable predisposing disposition of the human mind towards religious impressions; as if the dark and blood-stained avenues of superstition could ever lead to the realms of light. As the day appointed for the sacrifice of the innocent maiden at the shrine of a bloody and remorseless delusion drew near, Tobias Harpsfield became every hour more intensely beset by remorse and fear, those twin scourges of crime that always hunt in couples. At times, his better feelings prompted him to make a full confession in private to the pastor, in order that he might exert his commanding influence in behalf of Miriam. But of the three great stages of reform---repentance, amendment, and atonement---he had only partially attained the former; for it was quite certain he was as much influenced by fear for himself as compassion for another. Pride, which often keeps men from falling, and at other times prevents their rising when they fall, became one of the great obstacles to a confession. Having long forfeited his own good opinion, he was the more anxious to preserve that of his neighbors, not only as a homage to his pride, but a spoke in the wheel of fortune. Thus laboring with the wretched indecision of conscious guilt, half willing, half opposed to making reparation, he secluded himself almost entirely at home, under pretence of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-441.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] indisposition, and at length sought to escape from the consciousness of guilt, or the fear of punishment, by wandering away no one knew whither. But he could not elude himself, and became every hour more and more the victim of guilt, remorse and fear. Let us leave the wretched man to his well-merited punishment, and return to those more deserving of our sympathy. Poor old Mildred, as before stated, was a devout believer not only in witchcraft, but ghosts, fairies, and hobgoblins. Though from sentiment and habit, she loved Miriam, yet had she such a religious horror, such a mortal antipathy to everything in any way connected with the agency of the great enemy of man, that she could not bring herself to hold communication with one not only accused, but convicted of having entered into a compact with himself, or any of his imps of darkness. She, therefore, though her heart yearned towards her young mistress, avoided all contact; and though she once or twice ventured to the door of the prison, recoiled with horror from entering. She spent much of her time in praying and chaunting hymns, and though her voice was not the sweetest in the world, yet if the heart be in tune it does not signify. She was thus employed one evening, just about the twilight hour, with her eyes shut according to custom, and moving back and forth, in an old rocking-chair, when she was roused by a knock, or rather gentle tap at the the door, succeeded by the sound of footsteps in the little passage that led to where she was sitting. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-442.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] As the footsteps approached still nearer, she opened her eyes, gazed for a moment at the intruder, uttered a loud scream, and attempted to run out of the room. But the figure arrested her with a strong grasp, which made her shudder to the very marrow of her bones. She stood trembling and panting for a few moments in an agony of fear, and then screamed out--- "Let me go! let me go! You are dead, you are buried---your flesh is crumbled into dust. Your hat was found floating on the sea, and your body on the shore. You are dead and buried, I say, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself to come out of your grave to frighten a poor lone woman." "Mildred! Mildred!" answered the ghost, still holding her fast---"don't be alarmed. I am neither dead nor buried. You will frighten your young mistress. Where is she? Is she---is she living---is she married? Is she at home? What has become of her, that I see her not here? Tell me---tell me, where is Miriam." "She's bewitched!" screamed Mildred---"she's turned witch herself, and bewitched Old Cat---she's sold herself to the Evil One, and is married to Satan. She sticks pins in little children---she worries old women---she rides on a broomstick, and is to be burnt or hanged next Friday!" and the poor old soul burst into a torrent of tears at the thought of the sad fate awaiting her young mistress. Then, as her fears returned, she struggled, and repeated---"Let me go! let me go! Master Langley, if it is really you." This information went like an icy dagger to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-443.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] heart of Langley Tyringham, for he it was. Unable to support himself, he let go Mildred's hand, sank into a chair, and covered his face. Not that he suspected poor Miriam of any other witchcraft save that of ladies' eyes, or believed in the existence of such diabolical compacts. But he had just come from an infected district, and seen and heard enough to be assured, that however absurd or monstrous a superstition might be, it was no laughing matter. He at once comprehended the dangerous situation of Miriam, and rousing himself, by degrees reassured Mildred, from whom he drew a full account of what has already been related. Having received this, he rushed towards the prison, regardless or perhaps forgetful of the effect of his sudden appearance before one, who doubtless, like Mildred, believed him dead. His heart melted into a feeling of inexpressible tenderness, the joint issue of pity and love, as he called to mind her lonely, desolate condition, for he had learned the death of her parents on his way. Arriving at the prison, it was with much difficulty he procured admittance. But the jailer, though deeply affected with the panic, and its attendant inhumanity, was naturally of a kind disposition, and being told by Langley that he was an old friend come from a far distance, at length showed him into the gloomy chamber occupied by the orphan girl. He entered without noise, and without being observed by Miriam, who was sitting at a grated window, which looked towards the west, as if contemplating the silent change from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-444.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] splendors of departing day, to the milder beauties of the starry night. But neither her heart nor her eye was fixed on the scene. Her thoughts were far away, among the memories of the past, the anticipations of the future. She was among the dead, not the living, and more occupied with others than herself. So profound was her abstraction, that she had not noticed either the opening or shutting of the door, for no hope ever entered there. As Langley approached close to her, she became conscious of the presence of some one, and raising her eyes she distinguished a man in the waning light. She passed her hand convulsively over her brow, looked once more, and casting herself forward with a heart-piercing exclamation, would have fallen on the floor had not Langley caught her in his arms. Worn down by her sufferings, both mind and body gave way, and for awhile she lay without sense or motion. Gradually the voice and caresses of Langley recalled her; and opening her eyes, she said, in tones that sank into the inmost depths of his heart--- "Art thou come from thy grave, Langley, to accompany me to mine?" "No, my beloved Miriam, I am come to move Heaven and earth to your rescue." "Ah! why didst thou come? I was content to die when I thought I was going to thee; but now I shall shrink from death, because it will bring about our separation. Oh! that I could have died ignorant that thou wert living!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-445.jpg) \- external link  - Page 216. ] "You are sorry, then, that I am alive?" said he, in tones of deep mortification, while he withdrew his arm from her support. "I am not welcome, then? You wish me dead?" "No, no, no! thou art thrice welcome to my heart--- to my arms," and she cast herself on his bosom; "I will borrow a few moments from the grave to be happy with thee; and Heaven, I trust, will pardon me that I mix one drop of sweetness in the bitter draught I must soon drain to the dregs." She leaned on his breast; she permitted him to clasp her in his arms, and kiss away the tears that now, the first for many days, trickled down her pale cheeks, and relieved her oppressed heart. In the joy of meeting again they forgot how soon they were to part; and it was not until the jailer made his appearance, and reminded Langley it was time to depart, that they awoke to a full perception of the present awful crisis. In which the Author, after Vindicating Himself from a Serious Charge, and Disclosing a Great Secret, Takes a Retrospect by Way of Accounting for the Appearance of the Ghost. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-446.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] During the interview recorded in the preceding chapter, it may well be presumed that Miriam, being a woman, had expressed a curiosity to know how Langley Tyringham happened to be in the land of the living, after having been drowned and his dead body actually recognized. This drew from him a relation, which will be given in our own words, inasmuch as Master Langley, in the course of his detail, indulged himself in divers digressions both of speech and action, in which he was encouraged, if not abetted, by Miriam, and which, to confess the truth, rendered his story rather desultory to a dispassionate hearer. Previous, however, to commencing our narrative, we feel it incumbent on ourselves to repel a grievous charge, which we foresee will be made against us by that class of readers between which and the writers of romance there is always a severe contest, the one to discover as soon, the other to keep his secret as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-447.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] long as possible. Such, however, is the sagacity and experience of romance readers of the present day, that the author, notwithstanding all his doublings, and windings, and dodgings, is generally fairly run down and unkenneled before he has got half through his first volume. Hence it is, that experienced writers of this class, who have written some two or three hundred volumes, have adopted the practice of writing extemporaneously, and commencing a work without having the remotest idea how it is to end, leaving the catastrophe to be worked out by accident. By this cunning device they hope to puzzle and confound the reader, so that he will be left in doubt to the last moment. Such, however, is the instinctive sagacity of this class of students, that this plan seldom, if ever, succeeds; and it is now a notorious fact, that most readers anticipate the author in his voyage, and discover to what port he is bound, long before he knows it himself. But all readers are not so knowing. There is a simple---we will not call them ignorant---for there are no such monsters at present---there is a simple class of romance readers, who have adopted the belief, that an author absolutely knows everything, past, present, and to come. But we solemnly assure them this is not the case. There are some few things of which we are ignorant; and this must be our apology for having cheated the reader out of so much valuable sympathy, by making him believe that Langley Tyringham was drowned, when in fact, no such accident had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-448.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] happened. For this, our apology must be, that we were ourselves entirely ignorant that our hero was actually still in the land of the living, until he suddenly made his appearance, as related in the preceding chapter. The truth is, that the scene of his supposed death, was so remote from all civilized life, and accompanied by such strange romantic circumstances, that we never could come at the truth, till we had the young gentleman's word for it, and, therefore, thought it most prudent to say nothing on the subject, lest we might mislead the simple reader, who pins his faith on the sleeve of an author, and believes everything he sees in print. With this explanation, which will, doubtless, be quite satisfactory, we proceed to abridge the relation of Master Langley, in our own way, seeing it is an awkward business for a man to be the hero of his own story. The departure of Harold Habingdon, and his family, without taking leave, had given no small offence to the old Cavalier, who was somewhat ceremonious, and considered a breach of etiquette near akin to a breach of the decalogue. It increased his distaste for the Roundheads, and gave occasion for divers flings at Crop-ears, Levellers, and Rebels. On Langley it had a far different effect. Though in the course of our story, we have dilated but briefly on the subject, considering love scenes much more agreeable to actors than spectators, yet had there been both time and opportunity, for the growth of an ardent, deep-seated, and lasting attachment between these young people, thus thrown together in a situation where the absence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-449.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] of those various excitements of the busy world, which fritter away the affections of the heart by piecemeal, and as it were neutralize each other, gives force and permanency to the master feeling, whatever that may be. This attachment which in its earliest stage, had been met by the positive prohibition of one parent and the stern, inflexible opposition of the other, had not been subdued or arrested, but strengthened by these obstacles. The damming up of the stream only raised the waters the higher, and threw them back with greater weight and volume. Langley became moody, careless, and abstracted--- neglected himself, and was indifferent to others. He took long rides, but could not tell on his return where he had been; he displayed no interest whatever in his former favorite amusements of hunting, and sailing on the river; and seemed altogether wrapt up in a sort of indolent, gloomy melancholy. The old Cavalier frequently took him to task, and as usual, only made matters worse. Like many fathers, he forgot his son was no longer a child, and treated him as a boy, when in fact, he had become a man. Langley had always cherished a warm filial affection, as well as a deep sense of duty towards his father; but his passionate overbearing reproaches, rather tended to awaken a spirit of resistance, than to soften his heart, or dispose him to yield his cherished feelings at the arbitrary command even of a parent. He thought that having submitted his actions to the will of his father, he had a right to his thoughts, at least. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-450.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] Finding his remonstrances and commands equally vain in altering the deportment of his son, the old Cavalier hit on a masterly expedient. He instigated his wife to negotiate a visit from a famous belle at the capital, who had figured at the court of Charles the Second, and it is said nearly captivated that monarch. She was, moreover, a young lady of great beauty and accomplishments, and an heiress, to boot. Lastly, she was niece to the Governor, who, besides being the representative of majesty, was a veritable knight of King James' creating. But Langley---as he assured Miriam---paid her not the least attention, beyond what was due to his mother's guest; and half the time was unconscious of her presence. The young lady---as well she might---soon became tired of the devoirs of the old Cavalier, who endeavored to atone for the deficiencies of his son, by a variety of gallant expedients, and returned home, where she pronounced Master Langley as stupid as an owl---bores being not yet in existence. The worthy gentleman began seriously to apprehend that his only son would die a bachelor, and the ancient name of Tyringham become extinct in the New World. As usual, in the last resort, and when he had gone so far in the wrong track, that he could not find his way back, he called the sage Gregory Moth to a consultation, to whose opinion he always paid great deference, when it squared with his own. "Gregory," quoth he, "What has got into that blockhead, my son? I can't tell what to make of him, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-451.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] not I. He is getting quite thin; he has lost all relish for horse-racing, hunting and sailing; eats little breakfast, forgets to come home to dinner, and what is worse than all, drinks no wine." "That's a very bad symptom," said Gregory, shaking his head. "Very bad---I shouldn't be surprised if he had a touch of the ague before long---hey?" "I am inclined to think, sir, that his complaint is more likely to turn out a fever. But verily, sir master of mine, did it never occur to you in your hours of serious meditation, that you were as blind as a bat, metaphorically speaking?" "Why, you impudent varlet, what do you mean by that, hey?" "Why, sir, with due submission, I mean exactly what I say, which is more than most people do. I consider you as having been struck with a preternatural blindness, intended, doubtless, as a punishment for having consulted me so often without taking my advice. I may be mistaken, sir, but I have sometimes doubted whether you can see the nose on your face." "I tell you what, Master Gregory Moth," quoth the Cavalier, brandishing his cane, "if you don't speak to the purpose, and that speedily, I can see clear enough to plant this stick directly on your nonce. 'Slife, sir, answer me without any of your infernal circumlocutions. What do you think is come over my son Langley?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-452.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] "Why, verily, sir, I opine that his very heart-strings are tied up in a true lover's knot." "Hey---what? Nonsense, Gregory---why, he has seen but one young white woman---except her that is just gone---since he came to years of discretion, and I positively prohibited him from visiting, talking to, or thinking of her." "Ah, sir, that's the very thing. Seeing but one young woman, he could make no comparisons to her disadvantage. Any woman standing alone in the wilderness is an angel. Touching your prohibitions---as I observed, with all due submission just now---you must be blind to all human experience not to know, that both men and women---being descendants of Adam and Eve---love nothing so dearly as forbidden fruit. Ergo--- speaking logically, my young master did doubtless fall in love with the Crop-ear's daughter as soon as possible after you forbade him, if he had not done so before." "Hum," quoth the Cavalier, thoughtfully, "very likely; I think I recollect something of that kind when I was young. But if the mischief is done, it is too late to prevent it now, eh?" "You never said a wiser thing in your life, sir, and in respect to the discretion of your tongue, marvelously resemble our most gracious sovereign, Charles the Second. In my humble opinion, the best way to treat an event after it hath actually happened is to let it take its course till it runs itself fairly aground, instead of getting our fingers crushed by attempting to stop [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-453.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] the stone while it is bounding full tilt down hill. The truth is, we don't know whether it will turn out good or bad, till we see the end of it; and as Seneca says--- I don't recollect exactly what he says, but it is something very much to the purpose---and certain it is that our misfortunes frequently turn out greatly to our benefit. The pursuit of happiness is like that of the hunter, who must plunge into thickets, swamps and puddles, to run down his game." "Gregory," said his master, "if your wisdom were not grievously adulterated by your folly, you might in good time make a fourth among the wise men of Gotham. If I understand you, which is no easy matter, I had better let Master Langley alone, till his love burns out of itself, like a fire in the mountains, eh?" "Assuredly, sir." "But if I find it won't burn out, what then?" "Why then, sir, logically speaking, I would let him seek out and marry the Crop-ear young lady, and then it will entirely go out in the common course of nature." "Well, I will let him alone awhile longer, and if I find it don't turn out a case of ague and fever, and he fails to recover his spirits, I may consent to let him take a trip to that nest of Roundheads down East, in search of that little damsel, who I should like mightily, if she were not of that confounded Puritan breed, which scorns to obey the king, much less a husband. She may have married or turned witch, as I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-454.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] hear one half of the women have in that quarter, and either specific will cure him. What say you, my trusty counsellor?" "I say amen, sir, and bow to your superior wisdom. It would be a great pity my young master should fail in transmitting your name and honors to posterity." "Aye, Gregory, and who knows what honors besides. I have received letters from home, by which I learn that his lordship, my elder brother, and first born of Egypt, has only four sons at present living, and is not in good health. Now suppose one should break his neck in a fox chase, a second be killed in battle, a third be drowned, and a fourth hang himself for want of excitement; you know Langley would come in for the estate and title. It is, therefore indispensable he should marry, in order to continue the line, which, after all, will suffer no disgrace by a union with the Roundhead's daughter, for he has a most infernal musty pedigree, Langley says." Thus ended the conference. But when, after the expiration of several months, it was found that Langley so far from recovering his spirits, became still more abstracted and melancholy; that though his disease did not turn out to be ague and fever, his health seemed gradually declining, the old Cavalier one day took occasion to question him directly, as to the cause of his change both in habits and manners, at the same time requesting a frank reply. Langley made no hesitation in opening his heart to his father, and in conclusion addressed him as follows: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-455.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] "So far as regards your commands to cease all intercourse with Miriam Habingdon, I have obeyed you, sir, and if we met it was by accident. As a father, you had a right to forbid my bringing into your house a daughter whose manners, habits, and religion were not only disagreeable but offensive to you. I was, and am still entirely dependent on your bounty, and so long as I continue so, have no claim to do as I please. But here, sir, I conceive your authority ceases. You have no right, derived from divine or human laws, to exact from me any farther sacrifice by commanding me to wed another. I neither can or will obey you. We are equally bound by an exchange of vows, as by the unchangeable feelings of my heart, at least; and I declare to you solemnly and before God, that no other woman shall ever stand with me before the altar, but my own Miriam. It rests with you, sir, to say whether I am to continue in an existence equally useless to myself and others; a solitary being, without a purpose in life; a burden to myself, and to those I would willingly rid of all burdens; or to give me a new existence, new hopes, new objects, and new excitements, by permitting me to seek Miriam, wherever she may be found. If I find she has forgotten me, and chosen another, I am not such a silly weakling but that I can leave and forget her. But if I find her, as I know I shall, true to her vows, I will make every effort to remove those objections which, I fear, my dear father, are far more difficult than yours to overcome. I entreat, I conjure, sir, as you value my happiness in this world, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-456.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] to let me go and try my fortune. Promise me, too, that if I succeed you will receive Miriam and cherish her as a daughter; for I swear to you she will deserve it. For my mother---I know I am sure of her." "Go, then, in God's name, and may success attend you," said the old Cavalier, overcome by this manly expostulation. "There is a vessel to sail in a few days. Get ready as soon as you can and return as early as possible, for who knows what may happen in your absence. From the savages there is now nothing to fear, but there is another foe, or fiend, as may be, who launches his arrows with more certainty than the Indian warrior." "Believe me, sir," cried Langley, who seemed at once awakened to new life, "believe me, I will not lose a moment, and I trust in Heaven I may bring you one who will be the solace of your age for long years to come." "Amen!" said the old cavalier, and they parted. Retrospect Continued. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-457.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] The matter being thus promptly settled, Master Hugh Tyringham, from the mere force of habit, consulted his better half on the subject, who, being a sensible woman, and an excellent wife, withal, very judiciously answered, "you know best, my dear," and proceeded quietly in a succession of painful endeavors to thread her needle. She was, indeed, a pattern of a woman, and merited a more particular introduction to the reader than we have yet given. This must be our apology for having said so little of her in the progress of our tale. Any good-for-nothing woman may be made to figure in romance: but it is no easy task to make anything of a discreet, plain, good-tempered dame, whose virtues are so nicely balanced and harmoniously blended that there is nothing monstrous or disproportioned to excite wonder, admiration or disgust. Hence, without doubt, it so often happens that writers of fiction are obliged to resort for their heroine to some strange, fantastic, incomprehensible being, as it were "half horse, half alligator, and a little of the snapping trutle," whose high attainments, sublime [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-458.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] genius and trancendental transcendentalism, serve no other purpose than to destroy her own happiness and that of all within the sphere of her influence. The gentle and judicious reader will pardon this, and all other digressions, most especially when we assure him that these seeming excrescences contain the very cream of our work. Having been forced, by the taste of the venerable public, to glean in the weather-beaten path of fiction, we have sought to mingle with it as much concealed morality as the spirit of the age will bear. The old Cavalier possessed many good qualities, though, like big John Bull, he sometimes had a disagreeable way of showing them. But it is not intended to hold him up as a model for husbands, for he was sometimes a little testy, and occasionally somewhat unreasonable. He neither liked his wife to agree with him without some little discussion, nor to oppose him without in the end coming round to his opinion. Tacit acquiescence was as disagreeable to him as obstinate resistance; and being on this particular occasion a little dubious as to the wisdom of his course, he wished to bolster himself up with the opinion of his wife. If the affair turned out badly, he might then throw all the responsibility upon her shoulders. When, therefore, she quietly answered, "you know best, my dear," he felt somewhat nettled at her passive obedience. "'Slife, Mistress Tyringham," said he, "I asked your advice, not your acquiescence. I am pretty well satisfied that I know best, yet, as two heads are better [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-459.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] than one---you know the old proverb---I should like to know what you think of this journey of Langley, eh?" "Why, my dear, as I said before, I think you know or ought to know best, and---bless me! if I haven't been stitching this petticoat wrong side outwards." "The devil take all stitching, patching and hemming. What has that to do with the matter? I want your opinion, madam." "Well, my dear, I agree with you perfectly." "Zounds! I tell you I don't wish you to agree with me perfectly." "Well, then, my dear---" "Don't dear me, if you please. You are never so affectionate as when doing all you can to provoke me." "Well, then, my---hem! I differ with you entirely," said she, laughing at the same time so exuberantly that she missed threading her needle three several times. "Mistress Tyringham," roared the Cavalier, "I don't wish to say anything disagreeable or disrespectful, but, by the Lord Harry, you are a great fool!" "Ah! my---Mr. Tyringham, you should not say that, at least in my presence. I may not be as wise as you, but it is quite impossible for one to have lived with you so long and be a fool. But, now, I recollect, Gregory has brought home one of the finest wild turkeys I ever saw, and I want your opinion about cooking it." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-460.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] Hereupon the worthy gentleman rubbed his hands with great glee, and the conference was ended in the pantry. It may be taken for granted that Langley Tyringham lost no time in making his arrangements for a voyage to New England in search of a wife. On inquiry, he learned that our old acquaintance, Captain Skeering, having established a regular trade between the two colonies, was now in port and on the eve of sailing. Accordingly, being liberally supplied with the one thing needful by his father, and letters of introduction to the Governor, as well as other gentlemen of Massachusetts Bay, he took an affectionate leave of his parents, not forgetting Gregory Moth; embarked with Captain Skeering, and cleared the capes with a prosperous breeze. The first and second day, Langley, being the only passenger, had the vessel to himself, but on the morning of the third, one of the sailors informed the captain that a "tarnation droll cretur" had just crept out of the forecastle, though nobody knew how he came there. The captain went forward, followed by Langley, to investigate this strange interloper, who at the first blush demonstrated himself to be a lost sheep from the flock of gentlemen. His garments had evidently once been rich and fashionable, but were now in the last stage of dissolution and decay, and he bore about him all the insignia of poverty, except humility; for he encountered the unwelcome looks of all around, with a hardy, insolent indifference. Though his face [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-461.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] was marred and blotched by intemperance, and his tattered garments smeared with dirt, still there was about him some of those evidences of better days, that often survive the lowest stages of degradation, and distinguish the fallen angel from the mere animal man. Captain Skeering was one who took everything coolly; he never got outwardly angry, and his self-possession was proof against a hurricane. He civilly inquired of the mysterious stranger, how he got on board, whence he came, and what his object in coming. "I hid myself in a locker," replied he, "I came from the capital, and my object was to escape the constable." "You don't say so," replied the captain, in his simple way. "What had you to do with a constable?" "Why, I had the misfortune to run in debt to my landlord, who was so unreasonable to expect payment from a man without the means." "Then you have no money, I guess," said the captain. "Not a groat." "And how do you expect to pay your passage, friend." "I don't expect to pay it, friend." "The deuce you don't. But maybe I do, though." "Look you, captain," said the gentleman vagabond, "I carry in my veins the blood of kings, and number among my ancestors, princes, dukes and earls by dozens." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-462.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] "Pooh," said the captain, "What's the use of being high born, if a man has no money?" "Use?" said the other, "very great use, sir. One of the greatest advantages of high birth is, that it makes merit entirely unnecessary. But listen---I have been a courtier, a soldier, a gambler, a highwayman, a bully, a cheat and a dupe. I have lived by my wits--- but there are two things I never descended to---I never worked or begged---I was above that. I was once within one degree of the top; I am now at the bottom; and though I lack courage to drown myself, I shouldn't much mind being drowned by another. Here I am without a shilling. If you don't choose to take me where you are going, fill my pockets with lead and throw me overboard, that I may give the lie to my good friends at home, who long since predicted I was born to be hanged." "But how came you to be in this miserable condition, if you have such great friends?" asked the captain. "I was a younger brother," answered the other, fiercely---"I was disinherited at my birth. Another came before me and reaped the harvest. Don't you know, sir, that to be second best among us is to be nothing. My elder brother started first in the race, took the purse, and left me the lining. He played the tyrant and I whipped him. They sent me to college, and I was expelled. They purchased me a commission in a regiment disbanded at the conclusion of peace. I sent to beg forgiveness of my father, but he said I had disgraced him. I joined a party who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-463.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] amused themselves occasionally on the king's highway, made a great prize at the expense of the life of the owner; was tried and condemned to the gallows. My father, fearing I should further disgrace him by being hanged, sent an agent to say he would procure my pardon if I would take an oath to change my name, leave England, and never return. I had a great mind to be hanged on purpose to spite my family, and leave behind me a famous dying speech and confession; but, on the whole, concluded to accept the terms offered, especially as they included a purse of money. Finally, I sailed on the Virginia voyage, arrived safe, spent my money, ran in debt, ran away, and here am I at your service." In the course of this brief, yet comprehensive detail, the gentleman vagabond, as we shall dub him, he having positively refused to disclose his name, seemed not the least affected by the recollections of the past or the prospects of the future; and it was evident that he had not only outlived the feeling of compunction, but the sense of shame. An outcast of Providence, he had neither the capacity or inclination to reform; and it seemed as if he was permitted to cumber the earth for the purpose of exhibiting an example proving the futility of high birth or noble blood in sustaining the dignity of man, without the aid of integrity and virtue. There was no help for it, however. The captain shrugged his shoulders and declined throwing him overboard; and he was suffered to remain until an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-464.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] opportunity offered of putting him on shore. It was curious to see how this miserable outcast carried his head above the common sailor, and with what silent contempt he declined answering any of their questions. He assumed an air of superiority over the captain, and if at any time he addressed Langley Tyringham, it was with an air of courtly condescension that would have been rather provoking in any one but such a ragamuffin. If asked to assist in any emergency, he turned up his nose in scorn, and swore that rather than debase himself by working, he would die in a hospital or swing on a gallows. The sailors dubbed him "the gentleman vagabond;" the captain prohibited his entering the cabin; and Langley contemplated him with a mixture of contempt and horror. Meanwhile, the good vessel sailed steadily onwards with a genial southerly breeze, and the worthy captain, having no special business at any intervening port, made no stop by the way. They had reached the easternmost extremity of Long Island, and the captain, having consigned the care of the schooner to his trusty mate, had retired to his cabin, when, in an instant, and without the least preparatory warning, a squall struck her while lying almost becalmed, and before she could recover way, threw her on her beam ends. The vessel did not fill immediately; but such was the confusion created by this accident, that no one thought of saving anything, ere it was too late. It was supposed at first that the gentleman vagabond had been washed overboard, until he was seen creeping out of the cabin, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-465.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] like a drowned rat. All were too much occupied to take any note of this circumstance, and none remembered it afterwards The squall was succeeded by a fierce gale, which continued nearly four and twenty hours, during which the vessel floated at random, until at length she was cast ashore on a small island, inhabited by Indians, and soon went to pieces. It is believed that this was what is now called Block Island, but as it is not material, we shall not insist upon it. The situation of the island and the sterility of the soil having hitherto protected it from the inroads of the whites, the savages had no injuries to revenge, and contented themselves with stripping their involuntary victims of their outward garments and setting them to work in various ways. Langley, being better dressed than the rest, his clothes were claimed by the principal chief, who reserved them for extraordinary occasions, and deposited them among the treasures of his wigwam. The gentleman vagabond also fell to the lot of the same high dignitary, who, after examining his costume with great contempt, suffered him to retain his ragged remnants as unworthy of his adoption. Here they remained in melancholy exile, the bondmen of barbarians, performing the work of slaves without the rewards of slavery, and without the hope of relief. Captain Skeering, who had once before been in a similar situation, set himself to making the best of a bad bargain. He labored as if for his own benefit, and preserved a perfect equanimity of temper on all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-466.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] occasions, only that he obstinately refused to work on Sundays. This, at first, brought him into difficulty, until he compounded matters by doing double duty on Saturdays. But of all persons in the world, your gentleman is in the most doleful predicament when obliged to resort to his physical energies in any useful employment; and Langley greatly excited the contempt of the squaws by his total ignorance of the art of raising squashes. He knew something of fishing and shooting, but the Indians would not trust him with weapons, or permit his going out in a canoe. He suffered many hardships and privations, which, however, had this advantage, that their close pressure often drew him from the most painful of all his contemplations, that of being probably forever divorced from Miriam and his home. As for the gentleman vagabond, the savages could make nothing of him. He swore he would not degrade himself and his ancestors by raising pumpkins and squashes; resisted all attempts at coercion, and finally entered into a treaty, by virtue of which he maintained his dignity on condition of furnishing the little papooses with plenty of whistles. Thus passed the time in hopeless captivity, until the Indians engaged in a great hunting expedition, in conjunction with a friendly tribe on the opposite shore of Long Island. As is usual on such occasions, all the men except the aged and decrepid, went forth, carrying with them their canoes, with the exception of a single one, reserved in case it became necessary to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-467.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] communicate with the hunting party. The prisoners were left behind, the distance of the island from all other points of land precluding their escape by swimming, and the single boat---a bark canoe---not affording them the means of conveyance. The next morning, but one, after the departure of the savages, not only the gentleman vagabond was missing, but likewise the canoe, as well as the garments of Langley Tyringham, that had been allotted to the great chief of the little island. In their place was found the dead body of an aged Indian, who had been left in charge of the royal wigwam, and who had evidently died by violence. It has been previously stated that this fellow, who had reached the last stage of human depravity, was observed emerging from the cabin of the schooner as she lay on her beam ends, immediately after being struck by the squall. In the confusion that followed, he had taken the opportunity to rifle Langley's trunk, in which the key had been carelessly left, of a wellfilled purse, and a pocket-book containing his letters of introduction, together with the formal consent of the old Cavalier to his marriage with Miriam Habingdon. These he concealed among his rags, and had been enabled to retain in consequence of his dress being as before stated, so filthy and worthless as not to excite the cupidity of the savages. Having noticed the position of the only canoe left behind by the hunting party, he conceived the design of using it to effect his escape from the island, and reaching the opposite shore of the continent, where he imagined he should [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-468.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] find the abodes of civilized men, and might avail himself of the money and papers he had purloined. As exclusively appertaining to the principal chief, he lodged in his wigwam with his aged father, a decrepid Indian warrior; and accordingly in the middle of the night when the old man was fast asleep, he took the opportunity to despatch him with a stone hatchet he had found in the wigwam. This done, he leisurely threw off his rags, and dressed himself in the hat and clothes that formerly belonged to Langley Tyringham; after which he made all speed to the canoe, which he launched from the beach, and jumping in, paddled off as fast as possible. The wind blowing off the island, the waters were quite smooth, and he proceeded toward the mainland without danger or difficulty, until he got out of the shelter of the island, and came within the influence of the waves of the Atlantic, when his situation became very precarious. Having little experience in the management of boats of any kind, he was tossed about at random; became bewildered and frightened, and finally, long before reaching the mainland, his canoe filled, capsized, and he was drowned. The finding his body and hat; the inference drawn from the letters, partially preserved in the leather pocket-book, and the attendant circumstances, are already known to the reader. The body had remained too long in the water to be recognized or described, and in due time the parents of Langley Tyringham received information that clothed them in sorrow and mourning. Retrospect Continued. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-469.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] The escape of the gentleman vagabond and the murder of the father of the chief placed Langley and his fellow captives, as they were well aware, in a most critical situation. There was no doubt that on the return of the hunting party, one at least of their number would be selected as a victim to the manes of the murdered Indian, and of course they cast about for the means of escaping. But none presented themselves. The boats of the schooner had been swept from the deck, and floated none knew whither; the only canoe left on the island had disappeared; and swimming to the mainland, or Long Island, was impracticable. Thus they remained, helpless and hopeless, until the arrival of the hunters. The rage of the chief on learning the murder of his father was terrible, and those aware of the savage law of retaliation need scarcely to be told, that it was determined that the innocent within their power should be sacrificed to atone for the crime of the guilty who had escaped. A council [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-470.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] was held, and well was it for the captives that the lazy savages could not bear the idea of depriving themselves of so many laborers, or they had all been condemned to the stake. It was unanimously decreed that one of the white men should be sacrificed, to appease the wandering spirit of the slaughtered Indian. The desire of vengeance yielded something to the love of ease; and the choice of a victim fell on Langley, whose labors were not so valuable as those of his sturdy companions. The execution of savage vengeance is as prompt as terrible, and the first notice our hero received of his doom was the entrance of a trio of savages, who forthwith painted him black, from head to foot. His experience of Indian manners and customs had but too well taught him the meaning of this ceremony, and a horrible conviction came over him that he was doomed to suffer a lingering death, aggravated by all the refinements of savage cruelty. He was a man of courage and firmness; but still this conviction almost unmanned him, and for a brief period he suffered the most acute anguish. He had hitherto lived in hope, but here ended all his hopes. He should never more see Miriam; the home of his father would become desolate, and he himself perish in agonies unutterable. The first shock over, however, he summoned up the spirit within him, and prepared to meet his fate like a man. He remained strictly guarded until the next day, when all things being in readiness, the whole tribe, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-471.jpg) \- external link  - Page 242. ] men, women and children, assembled in a little valley that opened out on the sea, to witness this great act of justice, for such it doubtless appeared to them. As is usual on such occasions, the passions of all, especially the women and children, had been wrought to the highest pitch of savage fury; and when the prisoner was led forth, and tied to the stake by a rope of sufficient length to permit him to move around in a circle within reach of the flames, he was received with yells of triumph that seemed the rejoicings of fiends. Every species of insult, exultation and malice, was resorted to by the women and children in order to irritate him into anger or complaint. But Langley had, during the preceding night, prepared himself to meet the horrors of his doom. He resolved to give these barbarians no cause of triumph over the white man, and he was capable of keeping his resolution. Capt. Skeering, who had done his best in his behalf, now, when the pile was about to be lighted, came to him, and with tears running down his weather-beaten face, said, "Master Tyringham, I will pray to God for you, it is all I can do," and, dropping on his knees, fulfilled his promise with pious fervor. The fire was now set to the pile, the smoke began to ascend slowly, and the victim, his hands tied behind him, stood still as death, with his eyes cast upwards, when the loud report of a cannon echoed far and near, and the next moment a vessel was seen to furl her sails and drop anchor immediately opposite the cove, about half a mile distant. At this sight the savages [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-472.jpg) \- external link  - Page 243. ] were thrown into great commotion, and paying no attention to the pile, the fire not being thoroughly lighted, went out of itself. Presently a boat was hoisted out from the vessel; a number of men descended the side, and she was rowed swiftly towards the shore, with a white flag flying at her stern. This signal, everywhere understood by civilized and savage men, brought the chief with all his people down to the beach to meet the strangers, who proved to be Dutchmen from the good town of the Manhadoes, engaged in a trading voyage according to the custom of those days. A communication was speedily opened, and a brisk exchange commenced, in which the instinct of nature proved a pretty good match for the refinements of civilization. The spirit of trade, indeed, seems a natural gift all the world over. Hearing, in the course of this contest of nature and art, that there were five or six Christian captives on the island, the captain, an honest, good-natured tobacco-smoking skipper, entered into a negociation for their redemption, in which he found no great difficulty except as to our hero. They were loth to lose the pleasure of banqueting on his tortures; but a case of genuine Scheidam removed all scruples, and it is earnestly hoped the worthy skipper will be acquitted even by the most sturdy tetotaler on the score of his benevolent purpose. Langley was accordingly unbound, and probably never man was so near the fire without scorching. There can be little doubt that he was grateful to Heaven for this timely interposition; but as he offered his thanks [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-473.jpg) \- external link  - Page 244. ] in secret, it is not thought proper to parade them before the public, as is too much the fashion in all ages. When the trading voyage was finished, the redeemed captives were carried to the Manhadoes, where they were well received and hospitably entertained, not excepting Captain Skeering and his seamen, though the Dutch were then in hot contention with the Yankees about boundaries, land being very scarce at that time. Captain Skeering and his crew soon found a passage home, and it should be recorded to his credit, that from this time, so long as the Dutch skipper lived, he never failed to send him a yearly present of a jolly quintal of that excellent fish ycleped dumb. Nor, to make an end of this special matter, was Langley at all behindhand in demonstrations of gratitude, for he kept his benefactor plentifully supplied with excellent James River tobacco, till death broke his pipe and extinguished its smoke for ever. Mynheer Tienhoven---for that was his name---used to affirm that he never puffed the fragrant weed with so much satisfaction, for it always reminded him of a Christian act, which, being "spiced," as he said, with the delight of smoking, was exceedingly toothsome to the nose. Arrived at the Manhadoes, Langley underwent a severe struggle as to the course he should pursue. His heart yearned towards the east, where dwelt his morning star; but, in addition to a strong feeling of duty which prompted him towards the south, in order to learn the fate of his parents, who, he supposed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-474.jpg) \- external link  - Page 245. ] must have long believed him dead, he was under durance to the great law of necessity, which carries all before it. The gentleman vagabond had relieved him of all his money, with the exception of some small coins which he carried in his pocket, which were appropriated by the savages, who bored holes in them and hung them in their noses by way of ornament. He finally decided to turn his face towards the south; ascertain the state of things at home, replenish his purse, and commence Coelebs again, guided by the information he had received from Captain Skeering. Having thus settled the matter, he waited impatiently for an opportunity to return home, which he could only accomplish by sea. Luckily such an one soon offered, and he proceeded on his voyage. Retrospect Concluded. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-475.jpg) \- external link  - Page 246. ] It was a pleasant evening of the early southern spring, and the old Cavalier sat in his arm-chair, on the piazza fronting towards the broad river, breathing, but not enjoying the balmy breeze that gently curled the lazy waters. But those who remembered him as he once was would scarcely have known him now. Disease and sorrow make sad work with age. He had heard of the death of his son, and soon after was seized with a severe fit of the gout, which, in its vagrant ramblings, had threatened the vital parts. Though partially recovered, he was weak in body and sorrowful in heart. Remorse, too, added its sting of scorpions, for he could not help reproaching himself with having been at least accessory to the death of his only son by his causeless antipathy to the Puritan's daughter. Gregory Moth, who now sympathised too deeply with his old master ever to play upon his foibles---if grief had left him any---was standing near him, when, after a long pause of deep thought, the old Cavalier thus said to his ancient dependent, in a feeble, trembling voice: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-476.jpg) \- external link  - Page 247. ] "Gregory, do you know what day this is?" "The tenth of May, sir," answered Gregory. "Yes, I know that---but do you know who was born this day?" "Master Langley, sir," said Gregory, hesitatingly. "Yes, you are right, Gregory. We used to keep this day merrily. It was once a day of joy, but now a day of sorrow. It is now only the birth-day of the dead, and should be kept not by merry ringings of bells, but doleful tollings, telling of the departure of some one to his long home." He paused awhile, and then suddenly resumed. "But perhaps he is not dead. It is not certain that he is dead. Perhaps he may yet live, for as yet we know nothing but by report, and I cannot help sometimes thinking I may yet see and bless him before I die." Gregory cherished no such hope; but he could not find it in his heart to aid in extinguishing the last spark in the bosom of his master. "There is nothing certain in this life, sir, but death, and nothing more uncertain than rumor. The report we have heard came from no one knows who, and from no one knows where. The vessel was lost, that's certain; but it is not certain all on board were lost with her. He was a good swimmer, and may have got ashore only to be captured by the savages along the coast. If so, it is no wonder you never heard from him. He may be yet alive and return." This suggestion seemed to reanimate the old Cavalier, and he exclaimed, eagerly, "True, Gregory, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-477.jpg) \- external link  - Page 248. ] true. Why have I not thought of this before? I will send in pursuit of him. I will hire a vessel and go myself. I will scour the country far and near. I--- I---" and here he sank back exhausted in his chair, panting for breath. At this moment Gregory descried a boat crossing the river, paddled by two negroes, with a third person sitting at the stern. The boat approached the shore opposite to the house; as she struck the land, the man in the stern leapt out, and sped towards the house in all haste. It was still bright twilight, and Gregory at once recognised the person approaching. He began to mutter almost unintelligibly, "Master! Master! he is coming---he---he is here. M---M---Master Langley is---" "Who did you say?" asked the Cavalier, feebly. "Who is come---did you not say something of Langley? Speak, varlet, who is coming or who is come?" "It is I, father," cried Langley, grasping his trembling hand. It is your son come back to receive your blessing." The old Cavalier recognised the voice of his son, and opened his arms to receive him. He could not bless him, for his voice was gone. But he pressed him in his arms, and old as he was, shed tears of joy. The meeting with his mother need not be described. It was like that of a mother of the old patriarchs, welcoming the son of her affections, who was dead but is alive again. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-478.jpg) \- external link  - Page 249. ] Now all was life and joy under the roof of the old Cavalier, who became once more splenetic, and Gregory logical. In short they were at least four times as happy as they would have been had they never been miscrable. Among the dregs of the cup of calamity are found the grains of gold dust, that enrich us ever afterwards, if we make a right use of them. But we cannot dwell on this picture, which indeed soon faded; for we are impatient to return to our heroine, who was left in such imminent jeopardy. Suffice it to say that grief treads on the heels of joy, even as joy does on those of sorrow. The bucket that goes down the well empty comes up full, and that which comes up full goes down empty. So rolls this changing world, and so let it roll, since all is for the best, as wise ones say. The light that flashed from the old Cavalier on the return of his lost child was as the last ray of the sun when it sinks behind the hills. His old enemy, the gout, roused up by the agitation of the enfeebled mind and wasted body, made a second inroad, and took possession of the citadel of life. He struck the victim on the head and the blow was mortal. The old Cavalier had reached the great Inn, where all the travellers of the earth sooner or later take up their last night's lodging. Let him rest in peace and no one disturb his ashes. After all due sacrifices to filial duty, Langley took occasion to intimate to his mother his intention of making another attempt to see Miriam Habingdon. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-479.jpg) \- external link  - Page 250. ] That excellent woman, who had a strange habit of forgetting that important being, self, at once acquiesced; and leaving Gregory, who, on this occasion, grievously anathematized the Crop-ears, to manage affairs out of doors, he set forth on his pilgrimage, as usual, by sea. Arriving safely at Boston, he lost no time in proceeding on his journey, which he accomplished without accident, just in time to see Miriam in a similar predicament with that from which he was rescued by the philanthropy of Skipper Tienhoven. Poor Miriam Habingdon!---All Human Means of no Avail---A Last Interview. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-480.jpg) \- external link  - Page 251. ] Scarcely had Langley Tyringham finished the story which we have thus abridged in our own words, when the jailer came in and apprised him it was time to depart. He took leave of the forlorn girl with feelings of pity, love and anguish, that almost sundered his heart, and cleft his brain asunder. Sleepless and miserable he occupied the livelong night in devising means of rescuing her who he had found at last only to lose again forever, by means he shuddered to realize. At length it occurred to him to seek an interview with Old Cat, in the hope of obtaining some clue that might guide him in one more effort to avert the fate of Miriam. Waiting impatiently for the morning he proceeded to the prison, and was admitted without hesitation by the keeper, who had no orders to the contrary, and who, in truth, began to feel no small sympathy in the fate of Miriam, whose sweetness of disposition and quiet resignation had touched his heart. He showed Langley into the room occupied by the old woman, and left them together. Langley found her in a state of great discontent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-481.jpg) \- external link  - Page 252. ] and impatience. Instead of being released, as Tobias assured her she would be by casting the burden of her supposed guilt on another, she had not only been remanded to prison but was assured by the jailer that her confession had only rendered her punishment more certain. She was muttering to herself a strange jargon, of which Langley could comprehend little but the name of Tobias Harpsfield, with whom she seemed greatly dissatisfied. By perseverance and coaxing he drew out of her sufficient to enable him to comprehend that the poor old creature had in some way or other been employed and deceived by Tobias. With unwearied patience he questioned and listened, until step by step he came to a full understanding of the foul conspiracy against Miriam. Feeling perfectly justified in a case like this, he affected great sympathy for her, and more sincere indignation against Tobias, for not interposing in her behalf as he had promised. Finally, he urged her, as the best means of escaping the fate which certainly awaited her, to make a full confession before the magistrate. To this she finally consented, and Langley, with a heavy burden removed from his heart, immediately proceeded to the court room, where the magistrates were now almost constantly in session, listening to new tales of witchcraft, which had so increased in number and extravagance, that they began to be alarmed at the new and terrible responsibilities continually cast upon them. It seemed as if the entire community was about to be involved in the crime of witchcraft. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-482.jpg) \- external link  - Page 253. ] On the representation of Langley, they consented that Old Cat should be brought before them for examination, and when she arrived, listened to her confession with great gravity. A short consultation ensued, in which the pastor, who constantly attended these meetings as a sort of spiritual counsellor, being still led captive by the demon of superstition, which equally hoodwinks the mind and hardens the heart, took the lead. He stated as his decided opinion that this confession of Old Cat was nothing more than one of the cunning devices of the devil to screen a favored disciple from merited punishment. He observed there was no end to the arts of the great enemy of man; and that most especially in these times, when doubtless for the punishment of the transgressions of the people, who had permitted divers heresies and schisms to grow up among them, the whole host of evil spirits had, as it were, been let loose upon the land, he would resort to every device of diabolical ingenuity in behalf of those he seduced into his toils. This reasoning, so suited to the times and the hearers, prevailed. The testimony which had been thought sufficient to convict, was declared insufficient to acquit poor Miriam, and the Old Cat was once more remanded to prison, muttering maledictions against the whole world, most especially Tobias Harpsfield. Langley Tyringham, who, until now, had not been fully aware of the state to which the minds of these pious, well-meaning men had been wrought by this terrible delusion, was stricken with disgust and horror at this perversion of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-483.jpg) \- external link  - Page 254. ] justice and humanity. He now, for the first time, became fully sensible of the desperate situation of Miriam, and felt the leaden hand of numb despair oppressing the vigor of his body, as well as the energies of his mind. "Alas!" thought he, "what possible chance is there that light should penetrate the deep gloom in which both reason and humanity seem alike buried forever. There is no hope for innocence when both religion and law combine for its destruction. No hope---no refuge---ha!" A sudden thought seemed to strike him, and rushing out of the court he bent his way to the place where he had taken lodgings. Here he loaded his pistols carefully, and concealing them about his person, proceeded rapidly to the abode of Tobias Harpsfield, at the door of which he knocked impetuously. A female answered the summons, from whom he learned Tobias was not at home. He had been absent several days, and left no word where he was going, or when he would return. "The last staff is broken---be it so---we will die together!" murmured Langley, as he staggered towards home. Convinced of the guilt of Tobias, and equally certain that none but a base coward could have hatched such a conspiracy against a lonely orphan girl, he had determined to force him to confession through his dastard fears, in the expectation that it would have more weight than that of the old woman. But he was gone, and now nothing less than a miracle could save her who had twined herself about [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-484.jpg) \- external link  - Page 255. ] his heart a thousand times more closely than ever by the double tie of love and pity. The day had been spent in these unavailing efforts, and it was evening ere he could visit Miriam, the last they were to pass together. She had not wondered at his absence, feeling assured that he labored in her behalf. As he approached, she gently yielded herself to his outstretched arms, and looking in his face, softly said, "To-morrow another bridegroom will come, and I must go with him. Till then, Langley, I am wholly thine." "Miriam," said he, as he held her closely to his heart, "think you that death shall ever part us?" "But for a season, I trust---not forever." "Not for a moment---we part no more." "I understand thee, Langley," said Miriam, quietly withdrawing from his arms. "Sit down by me and let us talk together. Thou hast a mother still living--- hast thou not?" Langley answered in the affirmative, and she proceeded: "I know full well, thou hast enough of what men call courage, or thou wouldst never have been the chosen of my heart. Thou hast the courage to die; but I exact of thee the courage to live. Could thy death preserve my life, there might be some motive for offering up the sacrifice. But to die with me, or follow after, would be to sacrifice thyself on the altar of cowardice. If thou indeed lovest me, thou must obey me and live." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-485.jpg) \- external link  - Page 256. ] "For what should I live?" asked he gloomily. "Live for the performance of those high and noble duties for which man was sent into this world, gifted with qualities which enable him to administer to the welfare of his fellow creatures. Live for thy country, which demands thy services, and merits thy devotion. Live for thy widowed mother, who, now in the vale of tears, will by thy death be robbed of her only stay and staff in this world. Live for me, Langley; for when thou art dead, there will be none to remember that I ever existed. Thou wilt be as a tomb to my memory; for while thou livest, I know I shall not be forgotten. But thy parent, thine only parent, think of her. The ties which bind the mother and the child are more holy than those of love. Live, then, and prove thyself worthy of mine." "I am glad you do not wish me to forget you," said Langley, a little reproachingly. "No---no---no---never! I wish thee to remember me for ever in this life, and if possible in the life to come--- as one who loved thee with all the depth and purity of woman's first and only love; as one who, when time shall have smoothed the rough furrows of grief, thou canst call to mind without reproach and without remorse. Let it be your consolation, that you never sought to lure me from the path of duty---never suffered thy selfish wishes to interfere with my painful self-denial, nor ever wilfully inflicted a pang on my heart. Thus, there will assuredly come a time when thou wilt remember poor Miriam; it may be with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-486.jpg) \- external link  - Page 257. ] sorrow, but it will be a sweet and gentle sorrow, softening not corroding thy heart, and free from all the bitterness of self-reproach. O! if it be permitted me to look down and see thee thus, it will add to my joys in the regions above." "Miriam, Miriam!" cried Langley, "is this the way you would reconcile me to losing you? Do you think I can see you dying a death of infamy---for so it will be in the eyes of all spectators but mine---do you think I can see you suffer an innocent victim to a blind and bloody superstition? It cannot be---it is not in man to bear it. I should go mad, and run a muck against all mankind. Having tried every means to avert your doom, I will die with you." "Thou art then a coward, Langley. I would not have believed it. Thou wilt deny my last request, and yet pretendest to love me. Thou wouldst add to the pains of death the last and bitterest pang. Cruel Langley, I did not expect this of thee;" and now for the first time she wept, and sobbed aloud. Langley could not stand this, and replied--- "Be satisfied, dearest love. I promise to bear my burden till it crushes me." She thanked him gratefully, and for a brief period they both remained silent, absorbed in deep reflection. At length Langley suddenly rose, and closely scrutinized the window, together with every part of the room. "It is impossible, at any rate it is too late now," said he, and resumed his seat again. "I was thinking," said Miriam, almost cheerfully, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-487.jpg) \- external link  - Page 258. ] "how little space I occupy in this world, and how few will miss me when I am gone. I was plucked up by the roots from my native soil, and have taken no root here. I am the last of a race that, if I may believe our family chronicle, had existed on the same spot eight hundred years. I shall perish here in this lonely corner of the earth, without being missed by any but you---for poor old Mildred has forsaken me since I became a witch---and the false and foolish stigma on my fame will soon be buried in forgetfulness. Why then should I fear to die? Death would perhaps be a hardship were it not the common lot of all the living. We all follow in the same track, and soon overtake each other. But I had forgotten. I have a request to make thee, Langley. It is, that when thou goest home, thou wilt entreat thy mother to call me her daughter Miriam. Wilt thou?" "I will" replied he, in a voice choking with agony. The jailer now summoned Langley to depart. It was as the knell of death, and both stood silent and immovable. At length Miriam said---as to herself--- "It must be, and it must be borne." Then once more voluntarily yielding to his arms, she spoke her last farewell. "Not for ever," faltered he, "I will be with you in your last moments---I will see you die---perhaps your example may give me courage to live." "Thou canst not bear it, dearest Langley." "Perhaps my heart will burst. So much the better. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-488.jpg) \- external link  - Page 259. ] But do not attempt to dissuade me, for so help me Heaven I will be with you." The jailer repeated the summons; Langley tore himself away to spend the rest of the night in wandering about like some guilty spectre, and Miriam to sink into that profound sleep which is the blessed refuge of mind and body, when exhausted by conflicting struggles. you one who will be the solace of your age for long years to come." "Amen!" said the old cavalier, and they parted. The Last Scenes in the Drama. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-489.jpg) \- external link  - Page 260. ] The sun rose clear and bright that morning, and the balmy airs of summer, as they gently fanned the flowers, the meadows, and the whispering woods, were as pure as the blameless spirit now about to take flight to the region of kindred spirits. A shower of rain which occurred during the night had left the atmosphere so transparently clear, that every object presented itself distinctly, while all together formed one beautiful and perfect harmony. The distant mountains seemed to have come more near, and every thing in nature glowed in its morning loveliness. It was one of those days so gracefully sketched by an old poet, "Sweet day, so calm, so clear, so bright, "The bridal of the earth and sky, "Soft dews shall weep thy fall to-night, "For thou must die." The river, gilded by the rays of the morning sun, coursed its graceful, lazy, winding way, through the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-490.jpg) \- external link  - Page 261. ] wide-spreading meadows sprinkled with many-colored flowers; the merry minstrels of the morning caroled a welcome to the blushing visitor; and every sight, and every sound, mingled together in all the wondrous harmony of cunning nature. All was repose, sleeping in infant smiles, save the ever restless passions of that reasoning worm called man, whose bosom, like the unbridled ocean, now foams in wrathful tempests, now settles in a still, delusive calm, meditating a wider devastation. Langley, after passing the night without rest or shelter, appeared before Miriam that morning looking the picture of desolation. His garments, saturated with the rain, clung to his body, and both his person and face exhibited the ravages of despair. He found her clothed, as she said, in her wedding garment of spotless white, calmly awaiting the bridegroom death. The hour was too solemn for the endearments of love; and little was said as they sat with their hands locked in each other, awaiting the appointed hour. Miriam had begged him to go and change his wet garments, but he turned away impatiently, as if indignant that she should think of such trifles at such a moment. A tear, which her own approaching fate could not draw, was wrung from her heart by pity for another. The signal was now given. They rose, embraced, kissed, and once more, and, for the last time, bade farewell. A procession was formed, headed by the magistrates and the pastor, and in the midst walked Langley and Miriam, hand in hand, to the spot where [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-491.jpg) \- external link  - Page 262. ] the victim was to be offered up to the dark demon of superstition. A crowd had gathered together, drawn by that strange feeling of mingled terror and curiosity which hurries so many thousands to witness scenes that scare their nightly pillow long after with spectres of fearful identity. Various were the impressions and whispered comments of the spectators on the appearance of Miriam in her snowy gown, with a face almost as white, and a still, calm air of resignation that some said looked like innocence. Others maintained it was more like hardened guilt; some beheld her with pity, others with shuddering antipathy, and a majority with holy horror. Of the stranger holding her hand and expressing in every lineament of his face feelings they could not define, it seemed the prevailing opinion he was nothing less than her familiar spirit in the disguise of a handsome youth. Things remained in this state for some time, for there seemed an unwillingness to proceed to the last act. At length the pastor approached her and proposed that they should join in prayer together. Miriam replied, "Thou hast not been my friend, but I will pray with thee and for thee;" and their prayers ascended together. As he heard her pronounce with deep devotion that name, which, according to universal conviction, could not be uttered by the unhallowed lips of the possessed of the devil, the well-meaning but misguided man looked in her face intently, and saw there such an expression of mingled piety, innocence and resignation, as shook his settled conviction [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-492.jpg) \- external link  - Page 263. ] of her depravity. Painful doubts flitted across his mind for a moment, but it was only an eddy of the tide, and the current again resumed its wonted direction. Miriam was now to be placed on the cart, where no coffin appeared according to custom, for these abhorred reprobates were buried without coffins, in highways, least they should contaminate the church-yards. It was necessary the hands of Miriam and Langley should be unclasped, and when this was done, it was as if the last tie was severed. Her last words, as she drew her hand from his, were, "Langley, take care of poor old Mildred. She has indeed deserted me, but it was from fear, not for want of affection to me. Take her with thee when thou goest home." Langley did not answer; he remained fixed like a statue in numb despair; his feelings were so intense that he had become almost unconscious of feeling. His eye glared around like one walking in sleep, and it was evident that he had no distinct perception of what was passing around him. The heart of Miriam bled when she divined his sad case, but she thought, "It is best it should be so---best for both of us." The moment was come. The sheriff, with trembling hands, tied the fatal knot, and then stood waiting the signal from the magistrates. The crowd remained in breathless silence, oppressed by a growing conviction of her innocence; the magistrates hesitated to give the signal, and the pastor heard the still, small voice whisper that he must hold himself accountable [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-493.jpg) \- external link  - Page 264. ] for his share of that day's work. At this moment, when the fate of Miriam hung by a single hair, Tobias Harpsfield, who, driven by the lash of the fiends, had returned that morning and mingled in the crowd, attracted the attention of those around him by the agitation he displayed. Struggling in the bonds of guilt and fear, and goaded on one hand by conscience, on the other by shame; shaking with agony at thus beholding the end of his machinations, he stood in a state of horrible irresolution, panting and perspiring--- now suddenly pushing the crowd before him, and then as suddenly retreating. At length, with a desperate effort he rushed forward, shouting aloud---"Stop! stop! she is innocent---halter me---hang me, for I alone am guilty. She is no witch. It was I that bribed the old woman to accuse this innocent maiden, whose murderer I shall be if she perishes. Give me the book and let me testify to the truth of what I say, and then give me a halter, for I have lately suffered ten times worse than death." A few words will explain the appearance and conduct of Tobias Harpsfield. As stated in a preceding chapter, he had, after finding all his efforts to rescue Miriam, from the web he himself had woven, vain, left the settlement in a state of mind that might have awakened pity for any other than such a base, unmanly villain. Lashed by guilt and fear, the twin executioners, who inflict justice on secret crimes, he roamed about, bearing a load of misery becoming every hour more difficult to carry. As the time drew near and nearer that was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-494.jpg) \- external link  - Page 265. ] to consummate his villany by the sacrifice of his victim, his struggles became more bitter. That selfishness which had been his ruling principle through life impelled him on to undo what he had done, not so much to make all the atonement in his power, but that he might rid himself of the sting of remorse, which he felt would follow the death of Miriam. He returned home irresolute; he attended at the execution, still irresolute, and he remained irresolute to the last, when remorse finally conquered shame, and he rushed forward at the critical moment, as just related. The timely repentance of Tobias arrested the execution. The magistrates, after receiving his confession in legal form, and consulting their oracle, the pastor, decided it was sufficient for the acquittal of Miriam, being in all respects corroborated by that of the old woman. Besides, Tobias labored under no suspicion of witchcraft, and his testimony was therefore considered orthodox. But there was something yet behind all this. The truth is, some occurrences had taken place within a few hours past that had a powerful influence in bringing about this decision. The mania of witchcraft was spreading like a pestilence; accusations poured in from all quarters, the product of hatred, envy, malice, revenge, or superstition; and the very evening before the events just related, the wives of the pastor and of one of the magistrates had been denounced as dealing in certain mystical demonstrations, by one of their neighbors, either from malice or possibly with a view of arresting the persecution [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-495.jpg) \- external link  - Page 266. ] by bringing it home to the persecutors. However this may be, the question was now brought to their own firesides and presented itself in a new aspect. They now began to apprehend they might themselves become victims to the panic they had thus fostered, and had, each one unknown to the other, tacitly resolved to set their faces against it in future. The pastor, too, had, as before stated, been for a moment shaken in his conviction of the guilt of our heroine, by the apparent sincerity of her devotion, and the magistrates, to do them justice, had recoiled from this last practical demonstration of the fatal consequences of this senseless, cruel superstition. They therefore hailed with pleasure so fair an opportunity of arresting a delusion which had now involved their own families, and accordingly promptly and unanimously decreed the release of Miriam. She had heard the declaration of Tobias, and during the dreadful pause of suspense had suffered more than when utterly hopeless of relief. Langley, too, had been roused by the same voice from his deadly stupor, and his first impulse was to rush towards Tobias and tear him to pieces. But he was forcibly restrained by the attending peace officers; and when her acquittal was announced, ran to the cart, untied the knot, received her in his arms, and almost carried her home. Here the first moments were consecrated to love, the next to pious gratitude; and the hours that succeeded almost made amends for those that went before this timely reprieve from a death of infamy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-496.jpg) \- external link  - Page 267. ] The present abode of Miriam was associated with too many painful recollections to render her desirous of remaining, and she readily consented to accompany Langley to the sunny South, there to be united in the presence of a new mother. Accompanied by Mildred, who continued for a long time rather shy of her mistress, after a parting visit to the graves of her parents, she set out on her third and last pilgrimage. The few years that had elapsed since she passed through the wilderness with her parents, had produced some of those wonders which the industry and enterprise of men achieve in this our New World, which still continues to advance like the giant with his seven-league boots, while the Old remains the cotemporary of past ages, and may be said to live in its ancient renown. Towns had been founded, forests cleared, and roads made, so that their journey to Boston was neither fatiguing or tedious. From thence they voyaged by sea to the capital of Virginia, and reached home without accident. Here Miriam was received by Mistress Tyringham with the welcome of an affectionate mother, and in due time pledged her vows to him who had so long possessed her heart. Those feelings of religious and political antipathy which had alienated their fathers, and caused so much suffering to their children, did not take root in the soil of mutual love. It would seem that civil and religious liberty are twin sisters, and cannot be divorced from each other. Hence America---we mean the United States, the legitimate representative of the New World [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-497.jpg) \- external link  - Page 268. ] \---is not the soil or genial clime for bigotry and persecution; and it is earnestly to be hoped it will be long, very long, before the blood-stained fiend of persecution and intolerance, which has perpetrated more revolting cruelties than ambition, avarice, or revenge, rears its Gorgon head over the ruins of liberty of conscience. Both Miriam and Langley were stricken deer. They had equally felt the barbed arrow tipt with poison, and shrunk from the hand by which it was launched. Miriam was actually married by a minister of the Established Church---there being at that time no other mode of wedding in Virginia---and thought the vows she pledged and received as binding as if they had been offered at a different shrine. Nay, when afterwards asked by her husband if she wished to accompany him to the only church in the neighborhood, which was Episcopal, she modestly replied, "I have no scruple in worshipping with Christians in any Christian church." Those who confound bigotry with piety, and mistake the venom of sectarianism for the healing balm of religion, will doubtless accuse our heroine of backsliding; but that which makes woman, or man either, more mild and tolerant towards others of a different sect, or more ready to exchange the offices of kind benevolence with them, cannot be wrong, by whatever name it may be called. And this is the moral of our tale. The new and endearing ties of wife and mother gradually moulded Miriam into something less solemn and abstracted. Though she never became a gay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-498.jpg) \- external link  - Page 269. ] woman, she did not lack a cheerful spriteliness, that shed a pleasant light around the fireside; and though not less pious, she was more tolerant of the piety of others, though exhibited in a different guise. Her early instilled prejudices against other sects were gradually absorbed by the mild, forgiving spirit of Christianity, whose basis is the universal brotherhood of mankind. Without being gay herself, she enjoyed the innocent gaiety of others; never railed at youthful sports or recreations because she did not choose to partake in them; nor did she ever turn with sour ingratitude from the bounties spread out before her by a beneficent Creator. Her most common and natural mood was a quiet gentleness; and no one ignorant of her story ever suspected the latent enthusiasm; the energetic purpose; the obstinate, unyielding sense of right; that lay dormant under the yielding softness, the mild benignity, the smiling acquiescence, of the Puritan's daughter. Honest Gregory Moth was still alive and flourishing on the return of his master, and survived years afterwards. He sometimes indulged his vein, by singing his favorite song of "Barnaby, Barnaby, thou'st been drinking," and often frightened Goody Mildred by affirming, with his usual gravity, that, logically speaking, her young mistress had certainly bewitched him, for he would do anything but run into danger for her. Langley, too, in their hours of chaste endearment, which actually outlived a month, often accused her of being an arrant witch, for she made him do just as she [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf316v2&image=316-499.jpg) \- external link  - Page 270. ] pleased. We cannot find that he ever succeeded to the title of his uncle, by outliving his four cousins, but certain it is that both he and Miriam lived long and happily, and their posterity still flourish in the Ancient Dominion . FINIS.
