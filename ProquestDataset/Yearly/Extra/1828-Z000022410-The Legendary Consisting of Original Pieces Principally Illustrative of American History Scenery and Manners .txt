Be it remembered, that on the fifteenth day of May, A. D. 1828, in the fifty- third year of the Independence of the United States of America, Samuel G. Goodrich , of the said district, has deposited in this office the title of a book, the right whereof he claims as proprietor, in the words following, to wit: ` The Legendary , consisting of Original Pieces, principally illustrative of American History, Scenery, and Manners. Edited by N. P. Willis. Volume 1.' In conformity to the act of the Congress of the United States, entitled `An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned; ' and also to an act, entitled `An act supplementary to an act, entitled, "An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned;" and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints.' JNO W. DAVIS, Clerk of the District of Massachusetts . EXAMINER PRESS. Hiram Tupper, Printer---Bromfield Lane. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-012.jpg) \- external link  - Preface iii. ] The design of the Legendary has been made very generally known. There still exists, however, a degree of misunderstanding with regard to it, which induces us to repeat, here, that it is intended as a vehicle for detached passages of history, romance, and vivid description of scenery and manners, materials for which exist so abundantly in our country. As far as can be discovered, the plan has met universal approbation. After a series of unavoidable delays we are enabled to offer the first volume to the public. It is hoped that it will be found interesting. Some things have been admitted which are not exactly relevant to the design of the work. This is owing partly to misapprehension by contributors, and a consequent difficulty in procuring materials of the required description; but, more especially, to the failure of several distinguished writers, whose delinquencies we were obliged to supply at an advanced state of publication. We have received but little descriptive national poetry. This department is, consequently, almost wholly miscellaneous. We regret it the less, however, that it gives a variety to the work, the want of which might otherwise have been felt. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-013.jpg) \- external link  - Preface iv. ] The tale of `The Palisadoes' was, with the permission of the author, taken from a volume now in press, and it is hoped, that, though thus given in anticipation to the public, it will not diminish the interest in the forthcoming series. The article upon `Vermont' is merely introductory to some legends of that State, which will appear in future numbers. The irregularity of other resources must be the editor's apology for the frequent occurrence of his own productions. It will readily be seen that the difficulties attending the production of the first number of a work so entirely original, will hardly allow of its being a fair specimen. The highly respectable support promised, and a better understanding of our intentions will enable us to present our future numbers with a more specific character, and, we trust, with stronger claims upon the good opinion of the public. We should be pleased to receive well written articles illustrating the history, manners, and scenery of the West Indies, South America, and the Canadas; traditions of the Western and Southern States; and, for our poetical department, national ballads, descriptions of scenery, traditions in verse, and good poetry of every description. It is particularly requested that contributions for the second volume may be sent to the publisher within the month of June next. We wish also that all who contribute to the work would give us liberty to attach their names to their productions. We render a grateful acknowledgement to our friendly contributors, and hope for a repetition of their kind offices. With a single wish, that the national character of the Legendary may secure for it the candor and good feeling of its readers, we submit the first volume to the public. Editor . -  May 1, 1828.

There stood the Indian hamlet, there the lake Spread its blue sheet, that flashed with many an oar, Where the brown otter plunged him from the brake, And the deer drank---as the light gale blew o'er, The twinkling maze-field rustled on the shore; And while that spot, so wild, and lone, and fair, A look of glad and innocent beauty wore, And peace was on the earth and in the air, The warrior lit the pile and bound his captive there. Not unavenged the foeman from the wood Beheld the deed, and when the midnight shade Was stillest, gorged his battle-axe with blood; All died---the wailing babe---the shrieking maid--- And in the flood of fire, that scathed the glade, The roofs went down; but deep the silence grew, When on the dewy woods the day-beam played; No more the cabin smokes rose wreathed and blue, And ever by their lake, lay moored the light canoe. BRYANT. There is a solitary spot, in a remote part of Maine, known by the name of Indian Old Point. The landscape has no peculiar beauty, save the little sparkling river, which winds gracefully and silently among the verdant hills, as if deeply contented with its sandy bed; and fields of Indian corn, tossing their silken tresses to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] the winds, as if conscious of rural beauty. Yet there is a charm thrown around this neglected and almost unknown place, by its association with some interesting passages in our earliest history. The soil is fertilized by the blood of a murdered tribe. Even now the spade strikes against wampum belts, which once covered hearts as bold and true, as ever beat beneath a crusader's shield, and gaudy beads are found, which once ornamented bosoms throbbing with as deep and fervent tenderness, as woman ever displayed in the mild courtesies of civilized life. Here, one hundred years ago, stood the village of the Norridgewocks, one of the many tribes of the scattered Abnakis. These Indians have been less celebrated than many of their brethren; for they had not the fierce valor of the Pequods, the sinewy strength of the Delawares, or the bell-toned language of the Iroquois. They were, however, an influential nation; of consequence on account of their numbers, as well as their subtilty. The Jesuits, too, had long been among them, led by their zeal to fasten the strong girdle of an imposing faith around the habitable globe; and they had gained over the untutored minds of these savages, their usual mysterious and extraordinary power. The long continued state of effervescence, produced by the Reformation, tended to settle this country with rigid, restless, and ambitious spirits. Our broad lands were considered an ample tract of debatable ground, where the nations of the earth might struggle for disputed possession; and terrible indeed was the contest for religious supremacy between France and England, during the early part of the eighteenth century. Of the energy and perseverance displayed in this cause, there are few more striking examples than Sebastian Ralle, the apostle of the Norridgewocks. His rude, cross-crowned church, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] standing in the heart of the American wilderness, proved the ambition and extent of that tremendous hierarchy, `whose roots were in another world, and whose far stretching shadow awed our own.' Surrounded by the wigwams of the Abnakis, it seemed like an apostle of Antioch descended among savages, pointing out to them the heaven he had left. Our forefathers indeed thought it wore a different, and most unholy aspect; but to romantic minds, the Catholic church, even in its most degraded state, must ever be an object of interest. The majestic Latin, so lofty in its sound, and yet so soulless now to all save the learned, seems like the fragments of a mighty ruin, which Rome, in her decaying pride, scattered over the nations of the earth; and the innumerable ceremonies, more voiceless than the language in which they are preserved, forcibly remind one of the pomp and power rivalled only by attendant corruption. In this point of view only could the humble church of the Norridgewocks kindle the imagination; for it had little outward proportion, or inward splendor. It stood in a sheltered spot, between two small, verdant hills, with one graceful feathery elm at its side, bending forward, at every signal from the breeze, and half shading the cross, as if both bowed down in worship. Various opinions were formed of the priest, who there administered the rites of a mysterious religion. All agreed that he was a learned man; some said he was benevolent and kind; while others pronounced him the most subtle and vindictive of hypocrites. The English settlers, who resided about three miles from the village of the Abnakis, regarded him with extreme aversion; but to the Indians he was the representative of the Good Spirit. It is true the maxims of the Jesuits had given something of sternness and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] cunning to a character naturally mild and frank; but he verily thought he was doing God's service, and he did it with a concentration of power and purpose well worthy of the respect it inspired. For thirty years he lived in the wilderness, sharing the dangers and privations incident to savage life. The languages of all the neighbouring tribes were familiar to him; and his utterance could not have been distinguished from that of a native, had it not been for a peculiarly softened cadence, and rapid enunciation. A restless light in his small, hazel eye, and the close compression of his lips, betokened one, who had, with a strong hand, thrown up dykes against the overflowing torrent of his own mad passions. The effort had likewise turned back many a gentle current of affection, which might have soothed and refreshed his heart; but let man do his worst, there are moments when nature will rebound from all the restraints imposed on her by pride, prejudice, or superstition. There were two objects in the secluded residence of the self-denying Jesuit, on whom he poured forth in fulness the love he could not wholly stifle within him. When he came to America, he found among the savages the orphan son of the Baron de Castine, by a beautiful young Abnakis. The child was remarkably pretty and engaging; and the lonely priest, finding his heart daily warming toward him, induced the squaw who nursed him, to take up her abode in his own wigwam. The Indians called him Otoolpha, `The Son of the Stranger,' and seemed to regard the adopted one with quite as much interest as their own offspring. Not a year after Otoolpha and his nurse were domesticated in the dwelling of the Jesuit, some of the tribe, on their return from Canada, found a nearly famished female infant in the wood. Had not Sebastian Ralle [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] been of the party, its sufferings would, probably, have met a violent end; but at his suggestion, comfortable nourishment, and such care as they could give it were afforded. A nose slightly approaching to aquiline, and a complexion less darkly colored than usual, betrayed an origin half European; but as her parentage and tribe were unknown, they gave her the emphatic name of Saupoolah, `The Scattered Leaf,' and engrafted her on the tree of Abnakis. From the first dawn of reason she gave indications of an impetuous, fearless, and romantic spirit. The squaw who nursed her, together with the little Otoolpha, tried in vain to curb her roving propensities. At four and five years old, she would frequently be absent several days, accompanied by her foster brother. The duties of the missionary often called him far from home, and it was absolutely impossible for him always to watch over them, either in kindness, or authority. Their long excursions during his absence, at first occasioned many anxious and wretched thoughts; but when he found his wayward proteges invariably returned, and when he saw they could cross streams, leap ditches, and thread their way through the labyrinths of the wilderness, with the boldness and sagacity of young hunters, he ceased to disturb himself on their account. During the whole of their adventurous childhood but one accident ever happened to them. They had been at the English settlement to beg some beads in exchange for their little baskets, and on their return, they took a fancy to cross the Kennebec, when recent rains had swollen its deep and beautiful waters. Saupoolah's life nearly fell a sacrifice to the rapidity of the current; but her foster brother ran, with the speed of lightning, to call assistance from the village they had just left. A muscular, kind hearted woman, by the name of Allan, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] lived in a log-house, very near the river. In the midst of his terror, Otoolpha remembered this circumstance, and went there for succor. His frightened looks told his story, even more plainly than his hurried exclamation;--- `Ogh! Saupoolah die'---the Great Spirit drink her up!' Mrs Allan saved the Indian child at the risk of her own life, dried her clothes, gave them something warm and comfortable to eat, and conducted them into their homeward path in safety. To this woman and her children Otoolpha and Saupoolah ever after clung with singular intensity of affection. During their childish summers, it was a daily occupation to fill baskets with berries for her little ones, whom they always chose to feed with their own hands, watching every morsel of the fruit as it disappeared between their rosy lips, with the most animated expressions of delight; and when they arrived at maturer years, they used the great influence they had with the tribe, to protect Mrs Allan from a thousand petty wrongs and insults, with which her white brethren were not unfrequently visited. Educated by the learned priest, as far as such fetterless souls could be educated, and associating only with savages, these extraordinary young people grew up with a strange mixture of European and aboriginal character. Both had the rapid, elastic tread of Indians; but the outlines of their tall, erect figures possessed something of the pliant gracefulness of France. When indignant, the expression of their eyes was like light from a burning-glass; but in softer moments, they had a melting glance, which belongs only to a civilized and voluptuous land. Saupoolah's hair, though remarkably soft and fine, had the jet black hue of the savage; Otoolpha's was brown, and when moistened by exercise, it sometimes curled slightly around his high, prominent forehead. The same mixture of nations was shown in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] their costume, as in their personal appearance. Otoolpha usually wore a brown cloth tunic, with tight sleeves, and large buttons, under which appeared a scarlet kilt falling to his knees, in heavy folds, edged with the fur of the silver fox, and fastened at the waist by a broad girdle, richly ornamented with Indian hieroglyphics. A coronet of scarlet dyed fur, to which were fastened four silver bells, gave indication of his noble descent; and from his neck were suspended a cross and rosary of sandal wood, which Sebastian Ralle declared to have been sanctified by the blessed touch of Innocent the Eleventh. Saupoolah's dress was nearly similar. Her tunic was deep yellow; and her scarlet kilt touched the fur edge of her high, closely fitted, and very gaudy moccasins. Her cap was not shaped unlike a bishop's mitre; gaily ornamented with shells and beadwork, and surmounted by the black feathers of three eagles her own arrow had slain. In the chase, she was as eager and keen eyed as Otoolpha. It was a noble sight to see them, equipped for the chase, bounding along through the forest. The healthful and rapid blood, coursing beneath their smooth, brown cheeks, gave a richness and vividness of beauty, which a fair, transparent complexion can never boast; and their motions had that graceful elasticity produced only by activity, unconsciousness, and freedom. Sebastian Ralle had been several years at Rome, in the service of the Pope, and had there acquired a refinement of taste uncommon at that early period. His adopted children sometimes accompanied him on his missionary expeditions to Canada and elsewhere, on which occasions the game they killed served for his support. When he saw them with their dark eyes fixed on a distant bird, arrows ready for flight, their majestic figures slightly bending backward, resting on one knee, with an advancing foot firmly fixed on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] the ground, displaying, by a natural bend of the limb, outlines most gracefully curved, he gazed upon them with uncontrolled delight; and he could not but acknowledge that the young savages, in their wild and careless beauty, rivalled the Apollos and woodnymphs to which classic imaginations had given birth. Such endowments are rare in Indian women; for the toils imposed upon them, usually weigh down the springs of the soul, till the body refuses to rebound at its feeble impulses; but when it does occur, it is the very perfection of ideal loveliness. Otoolpha would suffer no one to curb Saupoolah in her wildness and inspiration. To him and the Jesuit, she was docile and affectionate; to all others, haughty and impetuous. The Norridgewocks regarded them both with wonder and superstition, and frequently called them by a name, which signified the `Children of the Prophet.' The distant tribes, who frequently met them in their hunting excursions, were lost in admiration of their swiftness and majesty, and called them, by one consent, the `Twin Eagles of Abnakis.' Contemptuously as some think of our red brethren, genius was no rare endowment among them; and seldom have souls been so rich in the wealth of nature, as the two powerful and peculiar beings, whom we have described. Many were the bold and beautiful thoughts which rushed upon their untutored imaginations, as they roamed over a picturesque country, sleeping in clefts where panthers hid themselves, and scaling precipices from which they scared the screaming eagles. Perhaps cultivated intellect never received brighter thoughts from the holy rays of the evening star, or a stormier sense of grandeur from the cataract, than did these children of the wilderness. Their far leaping ideas, clothed in brief, poetic language, were perhaps more pleasant to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] secluded priest, than frequent intercourse with his own learned, but crafty order. To him they were indeed as `diamonds in the desert;' and long and painful were the penances he inflicted upon himself, for an all-absorbing love, which his erring conscience deemed a sin against that God, who bestowed such pure, delicious feelings on his mysterious creatures. The Jesuit was deeply read in human nature, and it needed but little sagacity to foresee that Saupoolah would soon be to her brother `something than sister dearer.' When Otoolpha was but seventeen, and his companion not quite fifteen, their frank and childish affection had obviously assumed a different character. Restlessness when separated, and timidity and constraint when they met, betrayed their slavery to a new and despotic power. Sebastian Ralle observed it with joy. Early disappointment and voluntary vows had made the best and most luxurious emotions of our nature a sealed fountain within his own soul; but the old man had not forgotten youthful hopes and feelings, and for these beloved ones he coveted all earth had of happiness. They were married in presence of the whole tribe, with all the pomp and ceremony his limited means afforded. This event made no alteration in the household of the Jesuit. The old squaw, who had taken care of his adopted children from their infancy, performed all the services their half civilized way of life required, and the young hunters led the same wandering and fearless life as before. At the hour of sunset, it was the delight of the lonely priest to watch for their return, from a small opening, which served as a window to his study. It was a time he usually devoted to reflection and prayer; but the good man had virtues, which he called weaknesses and sins, and a spirit of devotion would not always remain with him at such seasons. The vine covered hills of France, his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] mother's kiss, and a bright, laughing girl, who had won his heart in early youth, would often rise before him with the distinctness of visions. The neglected rosary would fall from his hand, and love, as it first stole over a soul untainted by sensuality or selfishness, was the only heaven of which he dreamed. Such were the feelings with which he awaited the return of Otoolpha and Saupoolah, on the eleventh of December, 1719. Notwithstanding the lateness of the season, the day had been as mild as the first weeks of September. The drowsy sunshine dreaming on the hemlocks, pines, and cedars, had drawn forth an unusual fragrance; the children were at rest in the wigwams; most of the sanups had gone to Moose Head Lake, on a hunting expedition; and the few old men who remained, sat at the doors of their huts smoking their pipes in lazy silence. Wautoconomese, an aged prophet among them, declared this unnatural warmth to be a prelude of terrible things. He had gained his power of judging by a close observation of electrical phenomena and all the various changes of the weather, and it was no difficult matter to make his tribe mistake experience for inspiration. The women were all in alarm at his predictions; nor is it strange that the learned Jesuit, living as he did in a superstitious age, and believing doctrines highly calculated to excite the imagination, should be more affected by their terrors than he was willing to acknowledge, even to himself. These feelings naturally embodied themselves in anxiety concerning the two eccentric beings, whose presence was as morning sunshine in his dreary dwelling. The hour at which they usually returned, had long since passed; and strong and vigilant as he knew them to be, fearful thoughts of panthers and wolves crowded on his heart. Waking, he knew the fiercest prowlers of the wilderness would have shunned [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] them; but they might have slept where loup-cerviers were in ambush, and roused too late for safety. While philosophy was struggling with these harassing ideas, and every moment growing weaker in the contest, he observed in the north a flash more brilliant than ever precedes the rising sun. For a moment it was stationary; then it moved, quivered, hurtled, and flashed, as if there had been `war in heaven,' and the clouds, rolling themselves up `as a scroll,' showed the gleaming of javelins, thrown thick and fast along the embattled line. All at once, a vivid stream of light from the south towered up, like Lucifer in his terrific greatness, and rushed onward with a mighty noise. The fiery forces, nearly meeting at the zenith, were separated only by a clear, deep spot of blue, surrounded by a few fleecy clouds. The effect was awful. It seemed as if the All-seeing Eye were looking down upon a sinful world, in mingled wrath and pity. The Catholic bowed his head, and his subdued spirit was mute in worship and fear. His solitude was soon interrupted by Wautoconomese, whose trembling agitation betrayed how little he had foreseen that his pompous prophecies would be thus sublimely fulfilled. Next the aged squaw, who, from fear of interrupting her master in his devotions, had long been crouching in her own corner of the wigwam, more dead than alive, came in, and reverentially crossing herself, implored permission to remain. To these were soon added an accession of almost all the women in the hamlet. Perhaps Sebastian Ralle was hardly aware how much the presence of these rude, uninformed beings relieved his spirit. His explanations to them, mixed with the consolations of religion, nerved his mind with new strength; and he began to look upon the awful appearance in the heavens with a calmness and rationality worthy of him. By degrees the light [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] grew dim, then closed upon the speck of blue sky, which had appeared to keep watch over the souls of superstitious men, and the glorious scene seemed about to end. But suddenly a luminous bow shot from north to south with the rushing sound of a rocket, and divided the heavens with a broad belt of brightness. The phenomena of that night had been more extraordinary than any the Jesuit had ever witnessed; but until that moment he had known their name and nature; and, with that strange tendency to a belief in supernatural agency, which the greatest and wisest minds have, in a state of high excitement, his cheek now turned pale, and his heart dropped heavily within him, at what he deemed a sure presage of ruin to those he loved. Reason would have indeed told him that it did not comport with the economy of Providence to change the order of creation for so insignificant a thing as man; but who is not more under the influence of feeling than of reason? Unable to endure the terrific creations of his own fancy, he left the house, followed only by one of the tribe, and entered the path by which the young hunters usually returned. He pursued this route, for nearly a mile, without seeing any traces of the objects of his anxiety. At last, he heard a loud `Willoa.' The source of the clear, ringing sound could not be mistaken; for Saupoolah alone could give the shrillest tones of the human voice such depth and smoothness of melody. The Jesuit, by his long residence with the savages, had acquired their quickness of eye and ear, and a few moments brought him within view of his adopted child. She was standing in a thickly shaded part of the wood, her hand resting on her brow, looking backward, apparently listening with eagerness to the coming footsteps. A slight shade of disappointment passed over her face when she saw Otoolpha was not with her father; but it soon gave place to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] an affectionate smile, at his enthusiastic demonstrations of joy. From her brief account it appeared they had early in the evening heard distressed noises apparently proceeding from a human voice; that they had separated in search of those from whom it came, and had thus lost each other. As she finished her story, another loud shout sent echoing through the forest, betrayed more anxiety than was common to her fearless nature. Yet even amid her doubt and perplexity, her romantic soul was open to the influence of the sublime scene above her. As they wound along through the forest, ever and anon shouting with their united voices, in hopes the echo would arouse Otoolpha, she occasionally fixed her eye on the bright arch, which still preserved its wavy radiance, though a little softened by light flashes of clouds, through which the stars were distinctly visible. `The arrows have been flying fast among the tribes of heaven to night,' said she. `The stars have chased their enemies over the hills. They are returning victorious; and the moon has spread her mantle in their war path.' When such thoughts as these came over her, Saupoolah's eyes had a brightness totally different from the keenness and outward brilliancy common to fine looking Indians; it was a light that came from within, gleaming up from fires deep, deep down in the soul. It was probably this peculiarity, which had so universally gained for her the title of `Daughter of a Prophet;' and its effect on the savage, who had attended the Jesuit, was instantly observable; for he devoutly crossed himself, and walked at a great distance from the object of his veneration. Sebastian Ralle, accustomed as he was to the wild freaks, and almost infantile tenderness of his adopted children, had often smiled at their power over the tribe; yet something of pride, almost of deference, mingled with his own love of them. Saupoolah's remark, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] and the look of inspiration, with which she fixed her eye on the heavens, awakened in his mind the remembrance of many a season, when he had listened to their wild eloquence with wonder and delight. This train of thought betrayed itself in an eagerly affectionate glance at Saupoolah, and a loud shout to Otoolpha, that made the woods ring again. The young wife suddenly assumed the Indian attitude of intense listening; and joy flushed her whole face, like a sunbeam, as she exclaimed, `It is answered!' Another shout! there could be no mistake. It could not be the reverberation of an echo, for it was repeated louder and louder, at irregular intervals. A rapid and devious walk, guided by sounds which evidently grew nearer, brought Otoolpha in sight. Quick as a young fawn, overflowing with life and frolic, Saupoolah bounded forward, and sprang upon his neck. But the eye of the Jesuit, always rapid and restless in its movements, quickly glanced from his new found treasure to the objects around. A European lady, possessed of much matronly beauty, lay lifeless at his feet; and a fragile looking boy, apparently eight or nine years old, was bending over her, and weeping bitterly. This child, alone in the wilderness with his dead mother, had uttered those cries of distress and terror, which had startled Otoolpha and his companion. The sight of a white man seemed to the desolate boy a pledge of safety. He nestled close to the side of the priest, and looking up in his face imploringly, burst into tears. The heart of the Jesuit was touched. There was something in the boy's voice and the lady's features, that troubled the waters of a long sealed fountain. The Indians exchanged whispers with that air of solemnity, which the presence of the dead always inspires. They read a mixed feeling of agony and doubt in the countenance of Sebastian Ralle, but they did not ask, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] they never knew its origin. After a moment's silence, during which he seemed struggling with powerful emotion, he placed his hand gently on the boy's head, and spoke soothing words in French, which the child understood with perfect facility. No sigh, no outward sign of despair escaped him; but there was a marble stillness, which, like the ominous quiet of a volcano, betrayed that raging materials were at work within. He ordered the corpse to be borne to his wigwam with all possible gentleness; and when the unevenness of the path occasioned the least violence of motion, he would cringe, as if an adder had stung him. It was in vain that Wautoconomese and his frightened companion sought protection from him, on his return. Remarkable electrical appearances, in every variety of form, continued during the whole night; but the miserable man regarded them not. The lifeless mother was placed in his study, and he knelt down beside it with the boy, and spoke not a word. The old squaw brought in her tallest bayberry wax candles, and tried to prolong her stay in the room by a thousand little officious arts; but a gentle signal to withdraw was all she could gain from her heart stricken master. Day dawned, and found him unchanged in countenance or position. The boy, weary with grief and fatigue, had fallen asleep, and lay on the floor in a slumber as deep and peaceful as if unalloyed happiness had been his portion. The sight of his tranquil innocence, as the daylight shone upon his childish features, brought tears to the eyes of the rigid priest. It was a charm that broke the spell of agony which had bound down his spirit. The terribly cold and glassy look departed from him; but never, after that night, was Sebastian Ralle as he had been. Affliction did not soften and subdue him. It deepened the gloom with which he had long looked upon the world, and seemed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] to justify him in giving up his whole soul to the stern dictates of Jesuitical maxims. Even Otoolpha and Saupoolah met with occasional harshness; and William Ponsonby, the English boy, alone received uniform mildness and affection at his hands. He was a fair and delicate blossom; such a being as the heart would naturally cling to for its very fragility and dependence; but to none on earth, save Sebastian Ralle, was it known that there were other and deeper reasons for his peculiar tenderness. The lady, whom he had loved in early youth, had been induced by her parents to marry a wealthy Englishman, in preference to the unportioned Frenchman, whom alone she had truly loved. Her husband lost much of his fortune, and joined his countrymen against the French, during the troubled period between 1690 and 1762\. He was taken by the Indians, and his wife saw him suffer a horrid and lingering death. By the humanity of one of the savages, she made her escape, with her youngest son, the only one remaining of eight fine boys. She well knew the residence of that devoted lover, whom her weakness of purpose had driven to a life of solitude and self-denial; and to him she resolved to appeal for protection. Worn out with wandering and privation, she died suddenly in the wilderness, when her arduous journey was well nigh completed; and the conscientious priest, even in the anguish of a breaking heart, felt that it was well for him she had died; for to have seen the widowed one depending upon him for protection, when the solemn vows of his order had separated them forever, would have been worse than death to endure. The affection he had borne the mother rested on the child; and in him he found, what he had in vain wished for since his residence in the New World, a docile and intelligent scholar. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] The boy was indeed a sort of `young Edwin;' a sad, imaginative child, fond of his books, and still more fond of rambling far and wide with the wayward Saupoolah. The log-house of good Mrs Allan was the only place where William spoke in the language of his father; for English was a hateful sound to the ear of the Jesuit. The troubles between the neighbouring villages of English and Abnakis increased daily; and not a few of the latter were induced to revolt against their spiritual ruler. Distrust, jealousy, and weakness characterized all their councils. Their deep, but fluctuating feelings alternately showed themselves in insults to the priest, and acts of violence on their neighbours. Representatives were sent from the English villages on the Kennebec to the government at Boston, who protested against Sebastian Ralle, for constantly using his influence to excite Indian revenge to its utmost rancor; and letters filled with charges of this nature may still be seen in the records of the Historical Society. It is probable that they were, in some measure, well founded; for it was the dangerous creed of the Jesuits, that all human power, good or bad, should be made subservient to one grand end. Yet the Norridgewocks had so much reason to complain of the fraud and falsehood of the English, that it is difficult to decide to whom the greatest share of blame rightfully belongs. Be that as it may, affairs went from bad to worse. Mutual dislike became every day more inveterate; and Mrs Allan was the only one who had not in some way or other suffered from the powerful arm of the implacable Otoolpha. His French origin, the great influence he had over his tribe, and his entire submission to the will of the Jesuit, procured for him a double portion of hatred. Dislike was returned with all the fierceness and impetuosity of his savage nature; and English [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] mothers often frightened their children into obedience by the use of his terrible name. In the autumn of 1724, these discontents were obviously approaching a fearful crisis. A Council Fire was kindled at the village of the Abnakis; and fierce indeed were the imprecations uttered, and terrible the resolutions taken against the English. Wautoconomese in his fury said, that the Evil Spirit had governed them ever since William Ponsonby came among them; and he demanded that the boy should at once be sacrificed to an offended Deity. The lip of the venerable priest quivered and turned pale for an instant; but it passed quickly, and so carefully had even the muscles of his face been trained in obedience to the Society of Jesus, that rigid indifference could alone be read there, as he carelessly asked, `Wherefore should the child die?' The fierce old prophet watched his emotions as the snake fixes her infernal eye on the bird she is charming unto death. `Because the Great Spirit, who dwells among the windy hills, and covers himself with the snow mantle, has whispered it in the ear of the wise man,' said he proudly. `Wherefore else did he breathe softly on the wood, for four sleeps, and take his garments from the sun, that it might give warmth to the pale papoose, on his way through the wilderness? I tell you, he sent him to Wautoconomese, that he might sacrifice him instead of the young fawn and the beaver; for he loves not the white face and the double tongue of the Yengees.' `And the love I bear them is such as the panther gives the stricken deer,' replied the Jesuit. `Ye are all one! ye are all one!' answered the raging prophet. `The Yengees say their king has counted more scalps than any other chief; and you say he is but a boy to the great king, who lives where the vines run with oil. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] Ye both have faces pale as a sick woman. One hisses like a snake, and the other chatters like a mad cat bird; but both hunt the poor Indian like a buffalo to his trap. Wautoconomese was once a very big prophet. The Great Spirit spoke to him loud, and his tribe opened their eyes wide, that they might look on him. What is Wautoconomese now? He speaks the words of the Great Spirit; and ye laugh when ye tell the young men of his tribe that his ears are old, and he cannot hear.' His stormy eloquence awakened the slumbering pride of his warlike nation; and against the whole race of white men they inwardly breathed a vow of extermination. The boy was bound for sacrifice, and evil eyes were cast upon the Jesuit. The ingratitude of those for whom he had toiled thirty long years, and the threatened loss of the dearest object which God had left to cheer his lonely pilgrimage, seemed to freeze the faculties of the old man; and that day would have ended his trials with his life, had not Otoolpha stepped into the centre of the Council Circle, and, with a low bow to Wautoconomese, demanded to be heard. He spoke reverently of the prophet; but, by all the sufferings and kindness of their French Father, he conjured them not to be ungrateful to him in his old age. He begged for the boy's life, and promised to lead his tribe to war against every white man, woman, and child, from Corratwick Falls to the Big Sea, if they would thus reward his victory. He was a favorite with his tribe, and they listened to him. After much consultation, they determined on midnight marches at the end of three weeks, by which means they intended to surprise and put to death all the English settlers on the Kennebec. If successful in this attempt, William Ponsonby was safe; if not, the innocent child must fall a victim to their savage hatred. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] Saupoolah slept little the night after she listened to the Council of her tribe. She thought of Mrs Allan's kind looks, when she saved her from drowning; and she remembered the happy hours when she used to feed the children from her little berry basket. Could she not save her from the general ruin? She asked Otoolpha if no stratagem could be devised. He told her it would lead to detection, and the life of William and the priest would be forfeited. In her uneasy slumbers she dreamed of the murder of her benefactress; and she started up, declaring she would save Mrs Allan's life at the peril of her own. Otoolpha resolutely and somewhat harshly forbade her to do it. It was the first time he had ever spoken to her in a tone of authority; and her proud spirit rose against him. `I have loved him,' thought she, `but not with the tameness of a household drudge; if such is the service he wants, let him leave Saupoolah, and find a mate among the slaves of Abnakis.' Her manner the next day was cold, suspicious, and constrained towards her husband. She said no more to him of her plans, but sought advice from the priest. The heart broken old man was roused into sudden energy, and solemnly and vehemently forbade her project. Saupoolah's soul struggled in cords to which she had been entirely unaccustomed. She was silent, but determined. That night she left Otoolpha in a sound sleep, and effected her dangerous purpose secretly. She told Mrs Allan all the plans of the Norridgewocks, beseeching her to make no other use of the knowledge, than to save herself and family. The terrified matron promised she would not. But could, or ought, such a promise to be kept? Time passed on, and threw no light on the dangerous deed Saupoolah had dared to perform. Fears of its [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] consequences haunted her own soul, like a restless demon; and again and again did she extort from Mrs Allan a vow never to betray her. More than half of her fault sprang from a kind and generous nature; but she could not forgive herself for the vexation that had mingled with better feelings. Her pride and her buoyancy were both gone; and upon Otoolpha, Sebastian Ralle, and William Ponsonby, she lavished the most anxious fondness. The old priest cared little whether life or death were his portion; for he was old, and disappointment had ever been the shadow of his hopes. But for the dead mother's sake, his heart yearned for the life of the boy. Saupoolah, ever enthusiastic and self-sacrificing, promised to convey him away secretly, and place him under the protection of a Canadian priest. The time appointed was four days before the intended massacre of the English, when a Council Fire of one of the neighbouring tribes would induce most of the Norridgewocks to be absent. The night preceding his departure was a weary one to Sebastian Ralle. He spent it at William's couch in wakefulness and prayer. Affections, naturally intense, were all centered on this one object; and he had nerved himself to think that he must part with him, and then lay him down and die. The gray tints of morning rose upon him, showing the whole of his miserable little apartment in cheerless obscurity. The old priest, stern, philosophic, and rigid elsewhere, was in the seclusion of his own apartment, as wayward and affectionate as a child. He stooped down, and parting William's soft hair, imprinted a kiss on his forehead. The boy, half unconscious what he did, fondly nestled his cheek into the hand that rested on him. Sebastian Ralle looked upward with an expression that seemed to say, `O Father, would that this cup might [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] pass from me.' Just then the church bell, with feeble but sweet tones, announced the hour of early mass. William was on his feet in an instant, and as quickly knelt to his venerable friend to receive his customary benediction. In a few minutes, every living soul in the hamlet was within the walls of the church. Wigwams were all quiet, and canoes were wimpling about in Sandy river. The savages had all bowed down and crossed themselves before the unseen God. The broken voice of the Jesuit was heard loudly beseeching, ` Ora, ora pro nobis ,' when armed men rushed in amid their peaceful worship. The clashing of swords, the groans of the dying, and the yells of the frantic, mingled in one horrid chaos of clamor. Not one escaped; not one. Some called out, `Save William Ponsonby and the priest!' Others aimed at the breast of the Jesuit, as if he had been the only victim desired. The English boy threw himself forward and received a stab, aimed at the heart of his old friend; and the priest, with one convulsive bound, and one loud shriek of agony, withdrew the sword and plunged it deeply in his own breast. Saupoolah's noble heart broke with intensity of suffering. She fell lifeless by the side of the murdered William, and a dozen swords at once were pointed at her. Otoolpha cast one hurried glance upon her; and man has no power to speak the mingled rage, despair, and anguish, which that wild glance expressed. With the concentrated strength of fifty savages, he forced his way unhurt to the river side, and sprung into Saupoolah's favorite canoe. The boat filled with water; and he found that even here the treacherous revenge of his enemies would reach his life. With desperate strength he gained the shore, and ran toward the forest. His coronet and belt made him a conspicuous victim; multitudes were in pursuit; and he died covered with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] wounds.    Before the setting of the sun, the pretty hamlet was reduced to ashes; and the Indians slept their last sleep beneath their own possessions.    For many years two white crosses marked the place where the Jesuit and his English boy were buried; but they have long since been removed. The white man's corn is nourished by the bones of the Abnakis; and the name of their tribe is well nigh forgotten. BY WILLIAM CUTTER. It was a perfect Eden for beauty. The scent of flowers came up on the gale, the swift stream sparkled like a flow of diamonds in the sun, and a smile of soft light glistened on every leaf and blade, as they drank in the life-giving ray. Its significant loveliness was eloquent to the eye, and the heart; but a strange deep silence reigned over it all. So perfect was the unearthly hush, you could almost hear yourself think. KATAHDIN. Has thy foot ever trod that silent dell?--- 'T is a place for the voiceless thought to swell, And the eloquent song to go up unspoken, Like the incense of flowers whose urns are broken; And the unvailed heart may look in and see, In that deep, strange silence, its motions free, And learn how the pure in spirit feel That unseen Presence to which they kneel. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] No sound goes up from the quivering trees, When they spread their arms to the welcome breeze. They wave in the zephyr, they bow to the blast, But they breathe not a word of the power that passed; And their leaves come down on the turf and the stream, With as noiseless a fall as the step of a dream; And the breath that is bending the grass and the flowers, Moves o'er them as lightly as evening hours. The merry bird lights down on that dell, And hushing his breath, lest the song should swell, Sits with folded wing, in the balmy shade, Like a musical thought in the soul unsaid; And they of strong pinion and loftier flight Pass over that valley, like clouds in the night--- They move not a wing in that solemn sky, But sail in a reverent silence by. The deer in his flight has passed that way, And felt the deep spell's mysterious sway--- He hears not the rush of the path he cleaves, Nor his bounding step on the trampled leaves. The hare goes up on that sunny hill--- And the footsteps of morning are not more still. And the wild, and the fierce, and the mighty are there--- Unheard in the hush of that slumbering air. The stream rolls down in that valley serene, Content in its beautiful flow to be seen; And its fresh, flowery banks and its pebbly bed Were never yet told of its fountainhead. And it still rushes on---but they ask not why; With its smile of light it is hurrying by; Still gliding or leaping, unwhispered, unsung, Like the flow of bright fancies it flashes along. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] The wind sweeps by, and the leaves are stirred, But never a whisper or sigh is heard; And when its strong rush laid low the oak, Not a murmur the eloquent stillness broke; And the gay young echoes, those mockers that lie In the dark mountain sides, make no reply; But hushed in their caves, they are listening still For the songs of that valley to burst o'er the hill. I love society; I am o'erblest to hear The mingling voices of a world; mine ear Drinks in their music with a spiritual taste; I love companionship on life's gray waste, And might not live unheard;---yet that still vale--- It had no fearful mystery in its tale--- Its hush was grand, not awful---as if there The voice of nature were a breathing prayer. 'T was like a holy temple, where the pure Might join in their hushed worship, and be sure No sound of earth could come---a soul kept still, In faith's unanswering meekness, for Heaven's will--- Its eloquent thoughts sent upward and abroad, But all its deep, hushed voices kept for God! I wish I ne'er had seen her eye, Ne'er seen her cheek of doubtful dye, And never, never dared to sip The sweets that hung upon the lip Of faithless Emma! SONG. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] At the little village of Stanton-Drew, in Somersetshire, and not far from the splendid city of Bath, there is a large circle of upright stones, each of which is from five to six feet high. The learned are of opinion that it is a Druidical monument or temple, and they are countenanced by the name of the village; but the rustics call it `The Wedding;' for tradition asserts that it is a bridal party, changed to stone. And I would give my humble voice on the side of the rustics and tradition. The story is as follows. There lived in this place, I cannot say precisely when, but many hundred years ago, a peasant girl by the name of Emma. She was the beauty of the village. Nature had lavished her gifts with such profusion on this lovely cottager, that it was impossible for the meanness of her attire, or the humility of her employments to conceal her from general notice and admiration---they could not hide the perfect symmetry of her form, nor the dazzling whiteness of her skin, nor the sparkling of her full black eyes. The carnation hue of health was on her cheeks, her step fell as light as the first snow of the year on the Mendip hills, and her heart was as free and as simple as childhood's. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] A youth of the same village first taught that heart the mystic lore of love. He was not unworthy of the feelings which he inspired. Edred as far surpassed the other youth of the neighbourhood as Emma did the maidens. In manly sports and exercises he bore away the prize of every competition, and the land which he tilled was the most productive of any for miles around. He was generous, open-hearted, and affectionate, and though fearless, he was gentle and kind. Beside all this, his desire of knowledge had led him to seek the acquaintance and instruction of the members of a neighbouring monastery, who encouraged his wishes, and taught him to read and write---accomplishments, which in those days were extremely rare, even among those who were much higher born than Edred. In the ardor of youth, and with the most lively sensibilities, it is not to be supposed that he alone should remain insensible to those charms which led captive every other heart--- and as to Emma, she had too much discernment not to perceive his superior worth, and prefer him before all his rivals. Living near each other as they did, their opportunities of meeting were frequent, and they were improved. Preference ripened into love, and as they sat together one sweet moonlight evening under an old elm tree, which stood between the gardens of their parents, Edred poured out his vows at her feet, and Emma took Heaven to witness that she loved him alone, and loved him with her whole heart. From this moment they were hardly ever asunder. Day after day found them assisting each other in their daily labour, and night after night have the pale moonbeams, as they danced through the boughs of that old elm tree, been the only witnesses of their innocent and happy interviews. It was soon known throughout the village that their mutual faith was plighted. Their parents, far [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] from being averse to the union, were overjoyed at it; as to both parties it was a most desirable one, and it was settled between them that the marriage day should not be distant. But it would seem as if such happiness was too great to be durable, for the blighting of all this promise was at hand. A rich baron came to live in the neighbourhood. He saw Emma, and was enamoured. She perceived it, and avoided him. He was not however to be so discouraged; but, finding it impossible to obtain a hearing from the maid, he applied to her parents. He told them of his rank, his riches, his lands; protested that his views were honorable; and painted in glowing colors the advantages which would arise to them from their daughter's becoming the mistress of all his wealth and splendor. What could the simple people do? They were dazzled, they were overcome, and promised this titled suitor that they would use all their influence with their daughter in advancing his cause. They did so; they beset the poor girl, night and day; the mother intreated and wept, and the father commanded and frowned; and a sister too, whom she dearly loved, hung upon her neck, and kissed her, and clasped on her arms and braided in her hair the rich jewels which the baron had sent her, and begged her to be a baron's bride. Wearied, terrified, and melted by importunity, menace, and tears, and tempted too, it must be acknowledged, by the prospect of such an alliance as was held out to her, she at last consented to receive the baron as a lover---consented that all her engagements with Edred should be dissolved---consented to break her oaths, her vows, her faith, and Edred's heart. But where was Edred all this while? If he had been in the village, indeed, he might have saved his mistress from the guilt, and himself from the misery, of such a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] change. But necessity had called him to a distant part of the country, and he returned unconscious of all that had taken place in his absence, and unprepared for the storm that awaited his coming. He was not long kept in ignorance, for the story was in the mouth of every stripling in the village; and his eager eye had just caught a glimpse of the blue smoke which curled above the trees, and pointed out Emma's dwelling, when from a shepherd boy who was tending his flock on the hills, he heard it all. In a state little short of distraction, he flew to the door which always used to be thrown open before he reached it---and it was now shut against him--- he was told that the great man was there, and that he must not come in. He heard no more, but swooned on the threshold, and was borne away senseless to the cottage of his parents. As Emma, ignorant of Edred's return, was sitting on the following night at her window, after every one beside had gone to rest---for, torn by a thousand conflicting thoughts, she slept but little now---she saw something approaching the cottage, and shortly after heard a noise at the door. Trembling with an emotion for which she knew not how to account, she went down and opened it. The visitor was Edred's favorite dog, who dropt a packet at her feet, and, without waiting, as usual, to be caressed, disappeared. His master was then in the village---it could not be doubted---for the same faithful messenger had often been employed in happier days, to convey the letters which her first lover had taught her to read. Though ready to sink on the floor, she summoned all her strength, and sustained herself to her chamber, where, breaking the string which bound the packet, she read the following lines. `I thought you loved me, Emma---fondly thought you loved me---it was a dear delusion, but it is over now---a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] heavenly dream, but it has fled forever, and left me to the reality of wretchedness and despair. Would I could sleep again, and never waken! Is all that has past between us forgotten then? our blissful interviews, our plighted faith, our vowed affections, are they all forgotten? It is not, sure, so long since we parted, that every endearing recollection should thus have passed away. Why, it seems to me that the last kiss you gave me is yet warm on my cheek, and the last blessing you murmured is yet breathing its music to my ear. And now you do not know me---you will not see me---you turn me from your door; the heart that I once thought mine proves strange and cold, and the hand, that in the sight of men and angels was mine, you have given, you have sold, to another. And do you think that that other will love you with a love like mine, with a faith, a truth, a devotion like mine? He has towers, and halls, and vassals, and heaps of treasure; but what are these to love? He may boast of his long, unbroken line of ancestry, but can he tell you of an undivided heart? He may give you rank in the land, and clothe you with jewels, and surround you with slaves---but will he make your image his bosom's queen, to reign there supremely and alone? will he unlock to you the treasures of all his secret thoughts, and all his best and fondest affections? will he devote to you the service of his own exertions, his entire solicitude, his earnest cares, his very dreams? But I would, Emma---and I tell you now, that the time may come, when in all the glare of his lighted chambers, and amid crowds of his gay retainers, you will feel alone; and though the harps and the cymbals are ringing, and the songs of minstrels are loud, you will not hear them; and though the masquers and dancers are passing and repassing before your eyes, you will not see them; and the torches may blaze, and the revel [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] wax high---yet you will heed nothing and mark nothing--- for your soul will not be there---it will be wandering on the cool river bank, in the moon's pale light, or the grove's deep shade; it will visit the green lane, and the lowly cottage, and mayhap the poor peasant, who lived, and would have died for you. Forgive me, Emma, if I distress you; I still love, shall ever love you, and though you have made life as nothing to me, I hope, but can only hope, that it will be full of blessing for you. I have done with its pursuits and pleasures, and no longer acknowledge its relations. I shall retire to the monstery whose turrets you see rising from the valley, and spend the sad remnant of my days in prayer. Before the throne of Heaven, you will never be forgotten; in the silent cell your form will be constantly before me; in the early matin song, and the sweet vesper hymn, and the solemn midnight vigil, your dear name will rise unbidden to my lips, and be cherished in the holiest devotions of my heart. Farewell, farewell!' Emma was far from being insensible, and the shock occasioned by this letter threw her into a violent fever, in the delirium of which she was constantly raving of Edred. As she gradually recovered, however, her feelings of compunction and remorse became less poignant, and she again received the visits of the baron with composure. He, on his part, fearing some other untoward accident, urged their immediate nuptials. Everything was prepared, and as soon as Emma was able to leave her chamber she was conducted, or rather conveyed, by her successful lover, her parents, and her sister, to the village church, where their arrival was expected by one of the neighbouring monks, who had been previously engaged to perform the ceremony. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] As the marriage was to be strictly private, in order to shun the observation of the villagers, who were highly incensed at the parties, the evening was chosen for the time of its solemnization; and the recesses of the church were already wrapped in gloom, and a faint light scarce struggled through the painted windows, as the party advanced up the aisle, and drew around the altar. The monk opened his ritual, and in a hurried voice began to read the service. He had proceeded but a few lines, when a deeper shade suddenly pervaded the church, and these words were distinctly heard,---`The banns are forbidden!'---`Ha! by whom' cried the terrified ecclesiastic. `By Heaven and earth; by God and man!' answered the unearthly voice. `Nay, then, I cannot---' `Go on!' thundered the angry baron, `go on, I say, stupid, cowardly dotard, and mind not the shallow trick of some vile clown, who shall dearly rue this interruption, as thou shalt too, sir fool, if thou dost not despatch.' Thus threatened, the intimidated monk resumed the service, and came to that part of it in which he asked the baron, in the prescribed form, if he would have Emma for his wedded wife. `I will,' was the prompt reply. Turning then to Emma, he asked her if she would have the baron for her wedded husband. She spoke not, and stirred not, and the sharp, short echo of the vaulted roof returned, as if in mockery, the last word of his question---and all was silent again. `Art thou possessed, maiden, that thou respondest not to the holy words?' said the monk, in a tone in which fear, vexation, and impatience were blended---`what is in thee, that thou canst not pronounce two simple syllables? and here, the while, it has grown so dark, the saints of Heaven preserve us! that I can hardly see to read this holy sacrament of matrimony; and much I fear that I shall not reach our refectory in due season, for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] methinks the hour of supper must be already past, and this place feels strangely cold, wherefore I pray thee, maiden---' But here he seemed to have lost on a sudden all power of utterance, and his discourse was cut off in the midst. Emma's sister, surprised at her persevering silence, and indeed the silence, and unmoving features of the whole company, left her place, ran up to her, and laying her hand gently on her shoulder, `My sister, my dearest Emma!' she began---`but, gracious Virgin! what is this? how deadly cold you are! as cold---as cold---' she could say no more, but sunk down lifeless on the pavement of the chancel. The morrow was Sunday; and as the villagers assembled in the church, a strange and awful vision met their bewildered eyes---a regular assemblage of upright stones, occupying the holiest place, and throwing their long, still shadows over the aisles, as the morning sun glanced through the eastern window. It was attempted to remove them, but they yielded not in the least to the utmost efforts which could be employed. The brethren of the monastery were summoned; who, informed of the prodigy, approached the church in long procession, bearing lighted waxen tapers, and chanting hymns and burning incense. As they ranged themselves before the altar, the abbot pronounced a solemn incantation, while his companions flung holy water on the charmed stones; but it was all without effect---sacred spell and human strength were alike unavailing, and the solid masses remained unmoved. The church was deserted; no one would worship in it, for they said that it was God-forsaken. It gradually went to decay, its roof and walls fell in, and the materials were dispersed; but still those mysterious stones stood up, unhurt and unshaken. Of the church there is not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] now a vestige to be discovered; but those same stones are here, and here they will stay till the day of doom. This short thick stone, standing alone in the midst of the others, is the venal monk. That tall one opposite him is the bridegroom. These are the parents of the bride. This one, lying prostrate on the ground, is her sister. And that slender one, next to her, is the bride herself, the fair, but faithless Emma. Do you see the flat blue stone, hard by in that hollow, half hidden by the long grass and the bending hyacinth? It covers the grave of brother Lawrence, who intreated to be buried in this spot. They say that it is only around this stone that the grass and the wildflowers will grow; and it is also said, that brother Lawrence and the peasant Edred were the same. I was told, that the following custom had prevailed among the swains of Stanton-Drew, from that time to the present, and that it had been attended with the best effects. When any one of them has reason to suspect that the allurements of wealth or station may seduce from him the affections of his mistress, he leads her to this enchanted circle, and repeats to her the tradition of THE WEDDING. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] BY THE REV. JOHN PIERPONT. His falchion flashed along the Nile; His hosts he led through Alpine snows; O'er Moscow's towers, that blazed the while, His eagle flag unrolled---and froze. Here sleeps he now, alone!---not one Of all the kings whose crowns he gave, Bends o'er his dust;---nor wife nor son Has ever seen or sought his grave. Behind this sea-girt rock, the star That led him on from crown to crown Has sunk;---and nations from afar Gazed as it faded and went down. High is his couch;---the ocean flood Far, far below, by storms is curled; As round him heaved, while high he stood, A stormy and unstable world. Alone he sleeps! the mountain cloud, That Night hangs round him, and the breath Of morning scatters, is the shroud That wraps the conqueror's clay in death. Pause here! The far off world at last Breathes free;---the hand that shook its thrones, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] And to the earth its mitres cast, Lies powerless now beneath these stones. Hark! comes there, from the pyramids, And from Siberian wastes of snow, And Europe's hills, a voice that bids The world he awed to mourn him?---No: The only, the perpetual dirge That's heard here, is the sea-bird's cry--- The mournful murmur of the surge--- The cloud's deep voice---the wind's low sigh. BY N. P. WILLIS. \--- For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes, The still, sad music of humanity, Not harsh, nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air, And the blue sky--- WORDSWORTH. There is poetry that is not written. It is living in the hearts of many to whom rhyme is a mystery. As I here use it, it is delicate perception; something which is in the nature, enabling one man to detect harmony, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] and know forms of beauty better than another. It is like a peculiar gift of vision; not creating a new world, but making the world we live in more visible; enabling us to combine and separate and arrange elements of beauty into the fair proportions of a picture. The poet hears music in common sounds, and sees loveliness by the wayside. There is not a change in the sky, nor a noise of the water, nor a sweet human voice, which does not bring him pleasure. He sees all the light and hears all the music about him---and this is poetry. To one thus gifted, nature is a friend of many sweet offices and true consolations. Call it visionary if you will, she has glad fellowship for the happy, and medicine for the wounded spirit, and calm communion for gentle thoughts, which are the life of his moral being. Let him seek her when he will, if his heart be anything but dead, the poor sympathy of the world is a mockery to her ministering influences. I dare go farther. The power of nature over such a mind as I have described, is, in cases of extreme mental suffering, or abandonment, stronger than any other moral influence. [1] There is something in its deep and serene beauty, inexpressibly soothing to the diseased mind. It steals over it silently, and gradually, like an invisible finger, erasing its dark lines and removing its brooding shadows, and before he is aware, he is loving, and enjoying, and feeling, as he did in better days when his spirit was untroubled. To those who see nothing about them but physical convenience, these assertions may seem extravagant; but they are nevertheless true; and blessed be the Author of our faculties, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] there are some who know, by experience, that nature is a friend and a physician to the sick and solitary spirit of her worshipper. Paul Lorraine, by the above definition, was a poet. He had been what is called a strange child. It was a way of saying that they did not understand him. His unbounded gladness when gay, and his singular depression at times, were unaccountable. He was as docile and affectionate as a girl; but he would wander away on a summer morning and neglect his books like a very truant. He never could resist the stirrings of spring, and the smallest bird that went singing over him on his way to school, tempted him off irresistibly. His spirit revolted at confinement in such seasons, and when chid for absence, his spirit rose within him and he answered indignantly. On one of these occasions he was punished with a blow. I remember it as if it were yesterday. He was perfectly transformed. The delicate, quiet boy whom we expected to submit, and weep, sprang to his feet with the sternness of a lion. He compressed his beautiful lip, and his eye flashed for a moment---and then he stood calm and immoveable till the blood gushed from his nostrils. It was the last attempt to subdue him, and he was left to his own waywardness. At fourteen Paul Lorraine was the most engaging being I ever saw. He was tall for his years, and surpassingly graceful; but his face won you like a spell. It was not its regularity; not its clear, transparent complexion; not his fine eye, with its long, shadowy lashes; but a delicious melancholy that was refreshing, like the twilight, to look upon. He was happier than most boys; often gay; but whatever the expression of the moment, and whatever the change in features that were singularly flexible, the calm, angelic seriousness of that look was always there. His person was apparently slight; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] but exquisite symmetry, and the exercise of his early wanderings, had given it compactness, and the airy glide of his step was almost unearthly. His bearing was modest, and the habitual sadness of his countenance chastened it much; but no one could be long in his presence, without discovering that the chivalry of a highminded boy was among his readiest impulses. Is it singular that such a being should be loved? that in the early maturity of uncommon sensibilities, he should himself love, passionately? Perhaps it was the fault of his character that he was too susceptible. He certainly never could resist the delightful language of a woman's unmeant preference; and if this is a sin, it is the shadow of a virtue---a consequence inseparable from the very delicacy which ennobled him. I am not sure that the blush which betrayed the secret of Marion Graham, was not the first shot from the quiver we read of; but be that as it may, a truer affection never stirred the fine chords of the human bosom than the love of Paul Lorraine for that bewitching fairy. I have seen her often. I have played with her, by daylight, and moonlight, a thousand times; and I could describe her; but he has done it himself, better. He wrote the verses which follow in school, on a blank leaf of his Virgil: The tempting lip I never kissed, Or kissing, may not tell, Was like a flashing amethyst On which a tear has fell, Or rose leaves blushing through a mist, Or the tinting of a shell. I gazed upon that lip the while Her honied words did flow, And wondered at the hidden wile [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] That made my feelings glow, And wished my sister could beguile My weary spirit so. Her eye was bluer than the sky, And holier by far; And now was flashing vividly, Now tranquil as a star; And her lashes were bent droopingly, As the Madonna's are. The carpet scarcely took a print Of her elastic foot, And every step had meaning in't, Like moving to a lute, And fell like snow upon a flint--- As traceless and as mute. She was a woman, and a child; Capricious and mature; At time the wildest of the wild, Then saintly and demure. The silver moon was not as mild, Nor her silver light as pure. I loved her like a fervent boy, Too well to eat or sleep; And I grew serious of joy, Till I could almost weep; And feared my visits would annoy, And asked a curl to keep. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] That pleasant eve! That moonlight eve! The honeysuckle low! The trellis bars that seemed to weave The light and shadow so! And the half blown rose that made her grieve, That it should ever blow!--- It seemed the beauty of a spell, And she the spirit fair; I never loved the eve so well, Or breathed such balmy air; And Marion---but I must not tell The things that happened there. At twentyfive, Paul had mingled with the world. He had been caressed more than was good for his character, and had dipped deeper into pleasure than his better angel whispered him was innocent. He had learned to wear armor upon his feelings, and could go free among companions whose want of delicacy and consideration would have wounded him, once, like arrows. He had become what is called a man of the world, of the better order; such an one as women select for a defender, and men for an umpire in the nice distinctions of honor. He was to a certain degree, master of himself, and always a ruling spirit with others; a noble nature, that had suffered plausible, but false principles to graft themselves upon it. His worldly accomplishments, however, were as yet but the dress of the masquerader, and his heart was beating still, beneath it, with the fine impulses that wrought upon his boyhood. He had kept the poetry of his feelings apart from their profanation; and in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] midst of gaiety, it would visit him like a palpable touch, and lead him away in a rich dream to the beautiful treasures of his fancy. A reach of moonlight on a wall, or a glimpse of a bright star through the window of a ballroom, was talisman enough; and the contemplations of his early years would come at such bidding, and refresh him in the depth of a forgetfulness that would seem to be total. How often have I followed him from a crowded room, to see him lean over a balustrade, and with the merry laugh of `fair women and brave men' ringing in his ear, look up to the clear heavens with the enthusiastic and simple fervor of a child! To Marion he was true. She had grown up as he knew she must, with a heart too deep, and a mind too ardent for the light frame which imprisoned them. She was as delicate as a flower; but oh! her love was the breath of her being, that would one day exhaust it. She had the quick perceptions of her sex, united to the strong, intuitive capacities of genius. Her acquirements had elevated and expanded them; and without a knowledge of the world, or the trick of fashion, she stood alone among women like a `particular star,' and won from all the unqualified admiration she did not value. The love that Paul had begun with a boy's rash vow, was matured into a strong affection. It was the whole tide of his aim in life to be worthy of Marion. There were obstacles in the way of his happiness, however, which, in the opinion of his friends, made the attainment difficult, if not improbable. He was not rich, and had no apparent preference for any profession or business. While this was the case, a connexion was, of course, by the principles of this `working day world,' not to be thought of; and the fear on this subject, by those who knew the temper of his mind, was formidable. It had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] been, however, a theme of much reflection to him, and the subject, in his own feelings, wore a brighter aspect. His views, it is certain, were yet romantic, and he did not quite realize the dull servitude of business; but he had naturally a penetration and common sense, which were singular in a mind so gracefully gifted, and the sweet vision of Marion Graham, was, in his own view, a sufficient stimulus to all necessary sacrifice. Society, however, had many claims upon him, and with the irresistible fascination of his manner, it was not strange that he became a favorite. It is a trying relation to hold to the world, and true as it certainly was that he was not as deliriously devoted to its pleasures as those with whom he mingled, appearances often warranted remark, which heavily clouded the hopes of Marion. If his character had been better understood, she would have been spared the trial; but the air which he put on like a mantle, was to ordinary men the acquisition of half a life; and the hours he gave to society, and which were, to him, a relief from books, were to ordinary men dissipation, unfitting them for all serious employment. Who should know that the overflow of his spirit was more than their whole capacity? Who should know that the rich beauty of his language, and the authentic elegance of his address, were the original of their studied imitation? It was here that the candid, and the lenient, misunderstood, and misrepresented him. They believed upon common principles, and spoke with the persuasion of truth, and it required all the philosophy of Marion, not to tremble at the asserted tendency of his career. Lorraine was otherwise mistaken, and the result became the fever of her spirit. I have said that he was susceptible. He never ceased to love her. There was never a moment when he would not have preferred her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] immeasurably to a world of his reputed idols. But away from her sweet voice, and under the bewildering influence of music and excitement, he would be tempted into a momentary homage which was repeated to her with the coloring of scandal, till her heart was sick. It was not that she believed them. She knew in her clear judgment that his devoted manner was misconstrued, and his native ardor too far above the level of his fellows to be attributed to ordinary feeling; but the continual dropping which wears away a stone is a true emblem of the unquiet heart, and she wore away beneath it. Unavoidable circumstances kept him at a distance, and they seldom met. But with all the hallowed delicacy and deep tenderness of their love, that brief intercourse was constrained and painful. It was natural that it should be so. Her cheek glowed in his presence like the lip of a child; but a less practised eye might discover the history of sad, weary thought beneath it. He knew its intensity; and it was not strange, as she leaned feebly on his arm, that dark thoughts overshadowed his happiness. Could she be happy? This `wearing away to the land of the leal' is not the stealthy ministry they call it. It tells truly of its progress. And it is only when the shortened pulse and the difficult breath are wilfully disregarded, that the last call is a surprise to the sufferer. Could she be happy? She looked upon his noble forehead, and his manly beauty, and asked herself if the siren world would pass him by with its manifold temptations. It was no weakness of her trust. But the bias of elements so warm, and the workings of a spirit so unlike the tame temper of his fellows, might surely warrant anxiety in one who waited on their destiny. She remembered that the minute, and, to him, almost contemptible policy of life must be adopted; that his fine powers must be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] condensed and turned to profit; that he must forget his beautiful fancy, and forsake the attractions of frequented circles, and be no more alone with nature; that he must meet fraud, and calculation, and be patient with absurdity, and familiar with the low artifice of the shrewd; that he must change, totally; and for what? Riches! And would he do it? Yes, Marion! To fold you to his bosom, to take you to himself; shelter, protect, cherish you, were enough to bear him on, were it ten times the sacrifice. I have often thought that the fine spirits who are sometimes seen among us, were commissioned angels, gifted with bodies that should release them gently when their errand was done. It is to me almost a conviction. The frames of the very purest human beings whom it is our blessedness to know, are often so delicately balanced; they seem so readily and lightly to depart when the brightness of their life is overcast; to live so entirely to bless, and to die so truly at the hour when the sorrow of the world would overtake them, that I cannot think it a dream. Marion Graham was such an one. The fragile beauty of her form was more the delicacy of an ephemeron than the proper symmetry of a creature that would endure. It was evident in her childhood that the first shock given to her spirit would disengage it; and though many wept, none wondered when she visibly failed and assumed the treacherous loveliness of consumption. The anxieties of which I have spoken, and the constant fervor of a love which kept her heart feverish with excitement, were too much, and it was apparent that she was going down rapidly to the grave. It was not kept [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] from Lorraine, and he was prostrated with the blow. He had feared and expected it long; but it came upon him with the suddenness of a thunderbolt. The human heart is a subtle deceiver, and never believes till truth is inevitable; and that Marion would die---so soon! before he had pressed her to his heart, and called her his own, had, even to his darkest forebodings, seemed impossible. I cannot describe his feelings. He could not, adequately, himself. He was not permitted to go to her while a shadow of a hope remained, and he sunk into a stupor which seemed almost the calmness of delirium. I went to him one day, and found him more cheerful than usual. He had been writing the verses copied below, and it had relieved him. He handed them to me with a melancholy smile, and said they were his last poetry. Is death so near thee, Marion? Is it the time for thee To lay thy burden gently down, And let thy spirit free? And is this all thy ministry? Is thy brief errand done? Art thou so early for the grave, Sweet Marion? I cannot give thee up---to die! I cannot feel that thou Wilt lift no more that gentle eye, Nor come with that sweet brow! How could I---seeing not thy face, And hearing not thy tone--- Bear my impatient heartedness, And still live on! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] It is not yet! But sickness lies Heavily at thy heart, And dimness presseth down thine eyes, Till thou wouldst fain depart; And Oh! I may not bathe thy brow, Nor at thy pillow pray, Nor wait to close thy lids, when thou Hast past away! But fare thee well! If it must be--- If thou must falter---die! I care not if it be my lot Beside thee soon to lie--- The early vow will not be broke, Thy early beauty won, When low together we shall sleep--- Dear Marion! A few weeks elapsed, and Lorraine looked hourly for a summons to her death bed. It came, and he obeyed it with a sick heart and a wasted frame. The right of affection is acknowledged at such an hour, and he was led to her room immediately on his arrival. \---Could that be Marion? She, who lay before him with that radiant smile, was that the suffering, exhausted, dying Marion he looked to see? He gazed a moment on her face, and passed his hand over his eyes as if to know that it was not a dream; then going up to the bedside, he bent slowly and solemnly over her, and kissed her delicate lips as if the breath of an angel had made them holy. He was unprepared for a scene so different from his conceptions of death. She was so calm, so serene, so lovely in a decay that seems to anticipate the excellent beauty of heaven; her eye was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] so unnaturally bright, and her illumined features so like the `shining faces' of inspired description, that he was awed as by the presence of a spirit. She closed her eyes, and was visibly agitated for a few minutes; then, in a clear, sweet voice, she called him and he again leant over her. She spoke of her love; her former unkind fears, and present trust in his affection; of her hope in God, and her desire that he should seek Him earnestly; and requesting that he would once more press his lips to hers, became insensible. Presently she revived---shivered slightly---and, looking up to his face with the smile of a seraph---died! Spring, beautiful spring, with its delicious breath, and its new leaves, and its gladness for every living thing and creature under heaven, had come on, and with the perfection of its last, lagging foliage we began our wanderings. Lorraine was still an invalid, but better than we had dared to hope. Sickness had dealt severely with him the past winter, and a depression which he could not shake off, chequered with occasional delirium, threatened the total overthrow of his reason. He had so far recovered now as to bear the fatigue of travelling, and we trusted much to the sweet influences of the season for a restoration of both body and mind. We turned westward, and in a few days entered the valley of the Mohawk. I could write a book upon its sunsets, and the exquisite beauty of its banks and waters, but I must pass it without description. We loitered long and pleasantly upon its graceful windings, and though it won no smile or evidence of exhilaration from Lorraine, I could see that he was interested, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] now and then beguiled of his dark thoughts, and I hailed it as a promise of better things. On one of the balmiest mornings that ever broke, we descended the rude steps leading to the bed of the Trenton Falls. For some days I had perceived no change in Lorraine, and I began to fear, that the appearances upon which I had built my hopes, were but the effect of physical excitement, and that his diseased mind was beyond the skill of nature. We reached the bottom, and stood upon the broad, solid floor, a hundred feet down in the very heart of the rock, and in my first feeling of astonishment, even my interest in his impressions was forgotten; but its sublime grandeur had awakened him, and when I recovered my self-possession, he stood with his hands clasped, and his fine face glowing with surprise and pleasure. His figure had assumed the erect, airy freedom for which he was once remarkable, and as we went on, the alacrity of his step was delightful. In a few minutes we stood below the first fall. The whole volume of the river here descends fifty feet at a single leap. The basin which receives it is worn into a deep, circular abyss, and the dizzy whirl and tumult of the water is almost overpowering. We ascended at the side, and at a level with the top of the fall, passed under an immense shelf, overshadowing us almost at the height of a cloud, and advancing a little further, the whole grand sweep of the river was before us. It was a scene of which I had never before any conception, and I confess myself inadequate to describe it. To stand in the bed of a torrent, which flows for miles through a solid rock, at more than a hundred feet below the surface; to look up this tremendous gorge, and see, as far as the eye can stretch, a river rushing on with amazing velocity, leaping at every few rods over a fall, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] sinking into whirlpools, and sweeping round projecting rocks constantly and violently; to see this, and then look up as if from the depths of the earth to the giant walls that confine it, piled apparently to the very sky, this is a sensation to which no language that would not seem ridiculous hyperbole could do justice. When the first surprise is over, and the mind has become familiar in a degree with the majestic scope of the whole, there is something delightfully tranquillizing in its individual features. We spent the whole day in loitering idly up the stream, stopping at every fall, and every wild sweep of the narrow passes, and resting by the side of every gentle declivity where the water shot smoothly down with a surface as polished as if its arrowy velocity were the sleep of a transparent fountain. There is nothing more beautiful than water. Look at it when you will---in any of its thousand forms---in motion or at rest---dripping from the moss of a spring, or leaping in the thunder of a cataract---it has always the same wonderful, surpassing beauty. Its clear transparency, the grace of its every possible motion, the brilliant sheen of its foam, and its majestic march in the flood, are matched unitedly by no other element. Who has not `blessed it unaware?' If objects that meet the eye have any effect upon our happiness, water is among the first of human blessings. It is the gladdest thing under heaven. The inspired writers use it constantly as an image for gladness, and `chrystal waters' is the beautiful type of the Apocalypse for the joy of the New Jerusalem. I bless God for its daily usefulness; but it is because it is an every day blessing, that its splendor is unnoticed. Take a child to it, and he claps his little hands with delight; and present it to any one in a new form, and his senses are bewildered. The man of warm imagination, who looks for the first time on Niagara, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] feels an impulse to leap in, which is almost irresistible. What is it but a delirious fascination---the same spell which, in the loveliness of a woman, or the glory of a sunset cloud, draws you to the one, and makes you long for the golden wings of the other? I trust I shall be forgiven for this digression. It is one of feeling. I have loved the water from my childhood. It has cheated me of my sorrow when a homesick boy, and I have laid beside it in the summer days when an idle student, and deliciously forgot my dry philosophy. It has always the same pure flow, and the same low music, and is always ready to bear away your thoughts upon its bosom, like the Hindoo's barque of flowers, to an imaginative heaven. I had not troubled Lorraine with conversation. I thought it better to leave him to his own thoughts and the sweet influences about him. It seemed to accord with his feelings, and in the whole day's wanderings he had scarcely spoken. Late in the afternoon we retraced our steps, and as reascended from the glen, and threaded the green path homeward, the golden light of the sunset streamed into the wood, touching the tassels of the pine, and the stooping boughs of the hemlock, as if with living fire. It seemed as if the beautiful forms of the elements were leagued against Lorraine's melancholy, and as he went before me with an elastic step, stopping to gaze up through the trees at every reach of the sky, I thanked God in my heart for the surpassing loveliness of nature. The moon shone sweetly that night. Paul wrapped himself in his cloak, and we went out to walk. The light lay softly upon the hills. The thin exhalations rose up and floated just palpably in the air; and a scent of wild flowers was abroad, as if the fairies were dancing on them in every green nook of the wilderness. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] believe moonlight is sent for the feelings. It certainly makes some men better. There is an influence about it which cannot be resisted, and which glides into the heart with its subtle power, stealing away its grossness, and covering its dark thoughts like the ministry of an angel. Lorraine's mind had been aroused and prepared for such visitation. It melted him to a child. We sat down on a rock and he spoke for the first time of Marion. He wept freely, but silently, and without pain; for the fountains were broken up that had long been too full. He said the intolerable load of his heart was shaken off; that the image of Marion in the grave which had so haunted him, was removed, and he could think of her now as a pure spirit. Nature to his eye was changed. He had felt all day as if its light were coming back, and the moonlight was once more like the moonlight of his boyhood. He did not feel that he should so soon die. My story is done. I have no catastrophe to tell. My object was to write the history of a mind such as I have known, and exhibit nature as the physician and friend I believe she is. If my simple page should touch pleasantly a chord in the heart of any lover of her sweet influences, or lead one desponding mind to go out and be happy, its end will be answered. [1] I except religion of course; and I would be understood throughout this narrative as having no reference, comparative or direct, to that purest of all principles. My object is to illustrate the effect of nature on rare and imaginative minds, and not to state a theory of any general bearing whatever.

The sun went calmly to his rest, but threw Upon the purple clouds, as he declined, His golden mantle. All he left behind Was beautiful and gorgeous; yet the view Of the pure sapphire sky above, most drew And fixed my ravished eye; and to my mind, No colors in the sunset clouds combined, Could, like the exquisite cerulean hue Of that bright heaven, so melt and fire the soul. Thou mightst have fancied, hadst thou gazed there, That thou hadst reached the long desired goal Of the blest spirits from our earth---so fair, And so serenely soft above my head, Seemed then that heavenly pavilion spread. A SKETCH. See how the forest waves! The gnarled oak Ev'n bends---and as the unruly wind sweeps through Its sturdy branches, showers of leaves bestrew The ground, or diverse fly; the crow, just broke From out the warring wood, with ominous croak Wheels heavily through the air; the glorious hue Of the bright mantle summer lately threw O'er earth, is gone; and the sere leaves now choak [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] The turbid fountains and complaining brooks; The o'ershadowing pines, alone, through which I rove, Their verdure keep, although it darker looks; And hark! as it comes sighing through the grove, The exhausted gale a spirit there awakes, That wild and melancholy music makes. AFTER A SUMMER TEMPEST. Symbol of peace! lo, there the ethereal bow! And see, on flagging wing, the storm retreats Far 'mid the depths of space; and with him fleets His lurid train---the while in beauty glow Vale, hill, and sky, once more. How lustrous now Earth's verdant mantle! and the woods how bright! Where grass, leaf, flower, are sparkling in the light--- Prompt ever with the slightest breeze to throw The rain drops to the ground. Within the grove Music awakes; and from each little throat, Silent so long, bursts the wild note of love; The hurried babblings of the rill denote Its infant joy; and rushing swift along, The torrent gives to air, its hoarse and louder song. How beautifully soft it seems to sleep Upon the lap of the unbreathing vale, And where, unruffled by the gentlest gale, The lake its bosom spreads, and in its deep, Clear wave, another world appears to keep, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] To steal the heart from this! for through the veil Transparent we may see, tree, rock, hill, dale, And sapphire sky, and golden mountain steep, That real seem, though fairer than our own;--- Still, picture faint of that pure region drawn By prophet's pen, but not to mortal shown, Where flow rivers of bliss---and vale, and lawn Are strewn with flowers immortal---where, alone, Night never comes, and day is without dawn. BY GRENVILLE MELLEN. O Clouds ! ye ancient messengers, Old couriers of the sky, Treading as in primeval years, Yon still immensity! In march how wildly beautiful Along the deep ye tower, Begirt, as when from chaos dull Ye loomed in pride and power, To crown creation's morning hour. Ye perish not, ye passing clouds! But with the speed of Time, Ye flit your shadowy shapes, like shrouds, O'er each emerging clime; And thus on broad and furlless wings Ye float in light along, Where every jewelled planet sings Its clear eternal song, Over the path our friends have gone!

But when, to trail this sullen earth Ye stoop from higher air, And the glad regions of your birth, To sweep the mountains bare, In dim funereal pomp ye lower--- Oppressing like a pall--- Your brows of beauty veiled in power, Whose shadows round us fall--- Ye brood like demons o'er the ball. So our Life's hopes and promises In dreamy distance lie; So man a coming glory sees Along his visioned sky--- So, as those rainbow joys come on, Borne with his fleeting days, That bright Futurity is gone, And dulness dims his gaze--- Night gathers on his noontide blaze. Ye posters of the wakeless air! How silently ye glide Down the unfathomed atmosphere, That deep---deep, azure tide!

Your destiny how lone and strange! Ye bear the Bow of Beauty---flung On your triumphal path, Splendid as first in joy it hung O'er God's retiring wrath. The promise and the covenant Are written on your brow--- The mercy to the sinful sent Is bending o'er them now. Ye bear the memory of the Vow. Ye linger with the silver stars, Ye pass before the sun--- Ye marshal elements to wars, And when the roar is done, Ye lift your volumed robes in light, And wave them to the world, Like victory flags o'er scattered fight, Brave banners all unfurled--- Still there, though rent and tempest hurled. Ye bear the living thunder out, Ye pageants of the sky! Answering with trumpets' brattling shout The lightning's scorching eye. Pale faces cluster under ye, Beneath your withering look, And shaking hearts bow fearfully At your sublime rebuke. Has man his mockery forsook!

Then how the wakening landscape thrills! And thus ye circle countless spheres, Old spirits of the skies! The same through Nature's smiles and tears, Ye rose on Paradise. I hear a voice from out your shrouds, That tells me of decay--- For though ye stay not, hurtling clouds! Till the last gathering day, Ye pass like life's dim dreams away.

The Indians of whom I heard the most, were those who inhabit the vast unknown plains of the Pampas, and who are all horsemen, or rather pass their lives on horseback. The occupation of their lives is war, which they consider as their noble and most natural employment; and they declare, that the proudest attitude of the human figure is, when bending over his horse, man is riding at his enemy. Head's Journey over the Pampas and Andes . How calmly sleeps the desert! bright At times comes down the dim moonlight; And then yon sailing moon like gold, Dips in the huge cloud's blackened fold, And night's broad pinions, far and near, Darken the midnight atmosphere; Yet still those diamond stars on high Kindle the white frost brilliantly. Now stand we in the desert's heart, From all the peaceful world apart; Here is the roving Indian's land, And here by their watchfires, a band Of those fierce red men, strown around, Dream on their chilly couch, the ground. See, as the torch flames fiercely glow, The stern scowl on each swarthy brow! How strange and wild a scene! lo, here Glitters the Indian's ponderous spear; And there the flickering flames reveal The broad and sharpened battle steel; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] And by the embers, the hot blaze Each warrior's huge, dark frame displays; And at their feet the noble steed, That mocks the winged wind in speed.

Methinks I hear their thunders speak, And the loud earthquake shake each peak, And the hoar Andes' torrents bray In their stone channels, far away. Methinks on yon black mountain's base, The dark Cordillera, I trace The miner's simple hut, while high, Reared 'mid the tempests of the sky, Hangs the gray cross, that shows to all Some traveller's place of burial; And, far above the dizzy height, The condor wheels his lonely flight. Broad, bleak, illimitable plain! How like unto the shoreless main! Thy Pampas like its billows gleam, And yon lone tree methinks doth seem Like to some black, tall ship that rides Alone amid the heaving tides, And the gaunt creatures roaming free Seem like the monsters of the sea. And these are sons of kings---full long They ruled these wilds---a princely throng--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] And each led on his thousand spears, To scourge the land in those old years, And these their children bear the same Bold hearts, strong hands, and swords of flame--- The ostrich and the tiger quail When their free shouts are on the gale. BY THE AUTHOR OF `MORAL PIECES.' The rash intolerance of Louis the Fourteenth reached its climax in the revocation of the Edict of Nantz. That mad persecution of the Huguenots, which he styled `zeal for the extirpation of heresy,' might not subside until it had deprived his realm of half a million of his most valuable subjects. `France,' said Queen Christina, `is like a diseased man, who submits to the amputation of legs and arms, to cure a disease, which gentle treatment might conquer.' The Huguenots had endured the evils of an insolent soldiery quartered in their habitations, who, under the pretence of converting them to the Catholic faith, committed every outrage upon their property, persons, and families. Many were forced to become wanderers, or to take shelter in caves, and others yielded their lives to torture, rather than sin against the dictates of conscience. Still in their deepest depression, the edict of Henry of Navarre, which, in 1589, had given peace to their suffering fathers, continued to administer hope to them, until the fatal December of 1685, when it was revoked. They now every moment expected a repetition of the horrors of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] St Bartholomew. Flight was their only alternative, and to this many obstacles were opposed. Armed guards were stationed by the despot, to prevent their escape from the kingdom. Fathers were forced to immure their families in damp caverns, for temporary concealment, whence they issued, pale and emaciated. Delicate females, whom the breath of heaven had never before visited roughly, might be seen wandering unprotected amid the chill of winter; or in the recesses of some forest, a mother might be discovered hushing her wailing infant, lest its cries should direct the pursuit of the brutal soldier. Yet guided by that God whom they served, hundreds of thousands fled their beloved country and unnatural monarch, and found a peaceful refuge among pitying strangers. `What multitudes,' says the Abbe Millot, `of merchants, mechanics, officers, and learned men, were thus irrevocably lost to France?' The New World profited by this prodigality of the Old; nor was it of slight consequence, that among the elements of our national character, were blended the diligence, patience, and piety of a race faithful unto death for conscience' sake. Among those Huguenots who brought to our shores a wealth more incorruptible than silver or gold, were the congregation of the Reverend Pierre Daille, a descendant of the learned John Daille, author of the celebrated `Apology for the Reformed Churches.' They had been fortunate in effecting an escape, with the loss of but few of their number; and in two small vessels, Le Coligni and La Marguerete, directed their course to the shores of New England. The perils of their scantily appointed voyage, and the dangers of approaching our coast during the severity of a wintry snow storm, we do not mean to recount. Suffice it to say, that they arrived in Boston, worn and weary, but full of gratitude to their Preserver, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] and were received with that kind hospitality, which still makes so strong a feature in the character of that beautiful city. Little more than threescore years had elapsed since the first footsteps of our pilgrim ancestors explored the wilds and rocks of Plymouth. A few of these survived with hoary locks, to welcome the persecuted strangers, and bless that martyr spirit, with which their own had such strong affinity. The remainder of the winter was passed by the exiles in Boston, during which negotiations were concluded with Governor Dudley for the purchase of a tract of land for their future residence. It comprised the site which the present town of Oxford now occupies, in the county of Worcester, at the distance of about thirty miles from Boston. The river which intersects its beautiful vales, received from the emigrants the name of French River, which it still retains; but why they preferred for their settlement the appellation of New Oxford to some of the more romantic ones which the recollections of their native clime might have furnished, tradition does not inform us. As soon as the season permitted, some of the most hardy of the strangers, with a guide and assistants from the coast, went to take possession of their territory, to erect a few temporary habitations, and, in the technical language of the country, to `make a clearing.' Spring had a little advanced when the more delicate part of the colonists followed. The young turf was springing, and the silver leaf of the willow had hung out its banner. They entered on their hardships and privations with a cheerfulness which nothing could subdue. In those forests where Silence had reigned since the creation, they found a temple where God might be worshipped, free from the tyranny of man; and they who had been accustomed to the comforts of a luxuriant clime, went forth to their daily labor amid tangled [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] thickets, and returned nightly to their rude cabin, `an everlasting hymn within their souls.' Next to the care of providing habitations was that of erecting a small fort, as a refuge in case of an incursion of the aborigines. The tribe of Nipmuck Indians were borderers upon their territory, but evinced friendly dispositions toward the new settlers. A shelter from the storm, or a covert for the night was occasionally granted these children of the forest, and this simple hospitality seemed the groundwork of lasting amity. A few years wrought manifest changes in this infant colony. An air of neatness, and even of comfort, began to pervade the simple dwellings. Each had a spot devoted to the purposes of horticulture, where the seeds of France were already springing, as if forgetful that they grew in a foreign soil, and her vines putting forth their graceful tendrils, and timidly seeking a support. The pastor who had led his flock into the wilderness, took part in their labors and sorrows with a zeal which knew no declension. He aided them with his advice, or sat by their bed of disease, soothing their afflictions and heightening their joys by the hope of heaven. Piety was not with him merely a garb for the sabbath; every day it was seen walking with him, and enlightening the steps of others. It was impossible to be long in his presence without perceiving that his heart was above, not by moroseness or contempt of earthly cares, but by a secret and powerful influence which was ever lifting upward the thoughts of others. In his familiar visits to each domestic altar, amid the unrestrained flow of discourse which prompted every heart to pour out itself to him, an ejaculation, or the simple raising of his benign eye to heaven, was a signal to his confiding and half adoring flock, for the spirit to commune with its Father, if it were only through the aspiration of a moment. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] His wife, whose education and manners might have qualified her to move in courts, found no greater pleasure than in lending her aid to her beloved partner, in the instruction of the children of their people, and the comfort of the sick and the mourner. The fourteenth anniversary of the settlement of New Oxford approached. Every thing wore the appearance of a colony prosperous by its own industry. Some had exchanged their early dwellings for others of a better construction; and several had been added, for those who in childhood quitted their native land, yet had themselves become the founders of families. In their simple and unvitiated state of society, marriage, being solely the result of love, knew none of those obstructions which fashion and self-interest often interpose in its path. It was also contracted at an early period, for where celibacy is considered a dereliction of Nature's dictates, the approaches toward its boundary are deemed ungraceful. That false refinement or coldness of calculation, be it which it may, which prompts the inhabitants of cities, to defer a union which is to cheer the winter of life, until the beauties of its spring are past, was unknown here. An ordinance whose influence is so powerful over the destinies both of mortality and immortality, they held it desirable to solemnize ere the heart was rendered insensible by time, or the affections rigid by disappointment. Many of the more recently bridal tenements were tastefully ornamented with flowering shrubs, and trained vines, and not one in the settlement was without a garden appropriated to the cultivation of vegetables. That of Father Daille was principally a nursery of young fruit trees and medicinal plants. His skill in horticulture enabled him to transplant from among the former many acceptable presents for his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] people, while his knowledge of the science of medicine instructed him successfully to apply the latter to the relief of their physical infirmities. As yet no diseases of a serious nature had appeared among them. They forcibly illustrated how much industry promotes health of body, and moderated desires, health of mind. All were zealous to impart to their beloved pastor those productions for which they could not endure that a care should enter his mind, or divide his thoughts from their spiritual welfare. He created also another claim upon their affections, by assuming, in a great degree, the instruction of their children. His mind, deeply imbued with science, could not tolerate the idea that the rising generation should grow up in that ignorance which is so often the misfortune of new colonies. He appointed, therefore, to the boys and young men, stated lessons in the necessary departments of knowledge, judiciously adapted to their difference of age or capacity, and regularly convened them at his house for examination. His pastoral visits were always so conducted as to be subservient to the pursuits in which his pupils were engaged. It was then his delight to bestow explanation, to encourage perseverance, and to rouse indolence from slumber. An ardor to excel was thus strongly excited, and amid the daily processes of agricultural labor, animated conversations might be heard founded on their respective studies. Those whose proficiency was respectable, were admitted to his familiar lectures upon the higher branches of science and literature, and this was an honor sufficient to stimulate every exertion. Thus the good man had the satisfaction of perceiving his young charge initiated into that general knowledge which gives to thought liberality and resource. He could not fail to perceive that his influence over their opinions and affections was becoming unbounded; and he often thought, as he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] contemplated his little seminary, `are ye not all branches of my planting?' Madame Daille also extended the same care over the young females. Each, after being taught to read by the mother, attended her stated recitations. Here they repeated the lessons which had been assigned, and were questioned respecting their practical knowledge of the various departments of female industry and virtue. To gain her approbation was an object worthy to stimulate every effort, while her frown was dreaded like the reproof of conscience. Having herself received a finished education, it was impossible for her to maintain an intercourse of this nature, without imparting its benefits. Not only superior intelligence marked the more distinguished among her scholars, but all under her care displayed a correctness of deportment, and courtesy of manner, which are usually acquired only among the more polished classes of society. It was her custom at the close of her weekly examinations, to relate either some historical fact, or some invention of her own prolific imagination, which, in the form of a concise story, illustrated moral truth, reproved the errors which fell under her observation, or enforced the principles of piety. Yet it was not the intention of this highly cultivated lady, to turn the attention of her pupils too exclusively to literature, aware that in a new colony there are duties to be discharged, by her sex, for which no intellectual eminence will compensate. She would sometimes point to the fields of flax, whose blossoms tinged with a fine blue the vale around them, and expatiate on the excellence of those arts which could render this plant so subservient to the comfort of those whom they loved. Hence the distaff, the loom, and the needle, were considered honorable and graceful appendages, and every household was desirous that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] its internal manufactures should not only be equivalent to its own wants, but to the aid of those whom sickness might preclude from their accustomed diligence. On Saturday evening the two schools met each other, to receive instruction in those principles of religion which are of common concern, and to practise sacred psalmody, it being the wish of Father Daille, that all his congregation should be qualified to lift up, as with one voice, the high praises of God. There was something inexpressibly affecting in the pouring forth of that foreign music in this new land; the soft summer breezes, and the echo of the woods, seemed to prolong the cadence, as if they strove to naturalize the stranger melody. Thus peaceful and happy were the Huguenots whose fortunes we have hitherto pursued. The simple toils of agriculture gave them health and subsistence, the vain pursuit of wealth had not diseased their imaginations, nor the poison of ambition corrupted their hearts. Each householder considered the portion of ground attached to his habitation as his own. The remainder was an undivided, undisputed possession. Their herds drew nutriment from one common pasture; and on the plantations of maize or fields of grain, each man bestowed his portion of labor, and without jealousy divided the harvest. Lycurgus might have here seen illustrated his favorite theory of the Laconian brotherhood. No dissonance of opinion had hitherto arisen, which the advice of the elders could not harmonize, and the patriarch Daille gave daily thanks in his prayer, that one soul of love seemed infused into all his children. It is with grief that we darken this scene of more than Arcadian felicity. In the spring of 1700 it was deemed expedient to prepare for planting a large piece of land, at some distance from their earliest clearings, and thither one fine morning almost all the effective [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] strength of the colony was gathered. Jeanson, a man greatly respected for his serene gravity of deportment, and amiable disposition, having been detained at home later than his associates, was about taking his departure to join them, when the report of a musket was heard, and he fell weltering upon the green turf that skirted his threshold. Several Indians from an adjoining thicket then rushed into the house, and a scene of slaughter and desolation ensued, unparalleled, but in the annals of savage warfare. Those beautiful children, the infant in its cradle, the mother, intent upon their protection, not one was spared. The blood of the innocents empurpled the hearth stone of their murdered parents. At the sudden alarm, the colonists collected with agonized haste, yet too late to overtake the spoilers, whose flight was as rapid, as their deeds had been destructive. The mourning among the colonists it would be in vain to describe. Each man felt that he had lost a brother, and as he looked upon his dearest ones, shuddered lest they also might be stretched before his eyes, in the same terrible array of death. Apprehensive of a repetition of evil, necessary measures of precaution were taken; the more helpless retired to the fort, armed sentinels were placed for protection during the night, and the elders of the people met in consultation. Their countenances, usually so serene, were now variously marked with grief and indignation. `Let us,' said Johonnet, with impassioned gestures, `pursue with the dawn of morning, these barbarians. We will leave our wives and children in the fort, and not return until our brother's blood is fully avenged. The shades of the great Conde and Coligni shall not reproach us with suffering the lawless murderers to live.' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] Boutineau spoke next, an elder whose hair was silvered. `Their mode of warfare is as peculiar as their habits of life. They never meet in open battle, and who can pursue them into their wilds, and hope to return? While we are seeking to carry retribution into their wigwams, they might suddenly fall upon the precious pledges whom we leave behind, and extinguish our light forever. Surely our only mode of defence is in perpetual vigilance, and in never losing sight of our habitations.' `That our movements are narrowly watched,' said Sejournee, `is evident, from their having waited for the absence of almost every man able to bear arms, ere they hazarded this attack. It is not to be supposed that poor Jeanson had awakened their vindictive feelings, he, whose intercourse with all mankind was so peaceful. But the situation of his house, on the outskirts of the settlement, furnished apparent facility for satiating their cruelty with the least danger of retaliation. Does not this create suspicion of latent hostility towards the whole? And if it exist, will not a foe so subtle find fitting occasions to gratify it? Who can endure a life of perpetual watchfulness and dread, yet which of us will dare to lose sight of his home, lest at returning he should find his dearest blood flowing around his threshold?' Others expressed their opinions, yet ceased by an anxious appeal to Father Daille as umpire. `The tribe upon our boundary,' he answered, `is powerful, and much influenced by a vindictive prophet, who strives to instigate them to the extermination of all white men. This is probably the commencement of a series of aggressions. Your valor I know. It has been proved when men's souls were tried in the furnace. All that mortals could do, for the protection of their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] domestic altars, you would do, without a thought of fear or of repining. Yet ere we enter upon such a course, it becomes us to count the cost. While you stand in perpetual armor, the toils by which you gain subsistence, must decline, or be laid aside. To a peaceful people, this state of military watchfulness, and sleepless dread, would rob our brief life of half its value. Yet should a season of quiet, at any time lull our vigilance, who could assure us that the war whoop of the savage, or the midnight conflagration enwrapping our cottages, would not break our miserable slumbers? `Brethren and sons, let us return to that city, which first gave us welcome, when as exiles we came to this new world. There we shall find that safety, which we may be either too weak to secure, or forced to purchase at the expense of the blood of some, who are far dearer to us than life. Other employments than those of agriculture, may there procure subsistence for our families, and eventually we may dispose of these lands to colonists of more effective strength, or who may more readily command the aid of government in repelling the aggressions of the aborigines. Yet if in these prudential calculations I should be mistaken, still I cannot endure the thought that another of that number, who are as jewels in my heart, should be thus sacrificed. Merciless sons of the forest! "Me have ye bereaved of my children!" It is enough! However tender may be the ties which we sunder in leaving this beloved spot, I cannot consent to remain here, with the hazard of yielding to the scalping knife of the Indian, one more of these my children.' After a protracted consultation, the wish of the pastor became the decision of all, and the opinion was unanimous, that if the removal were made, it had better be immediate. They lingered but to make such [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] preparations as were unavoidable, and to pay the last sad obsequies to the departed. The succeeding day drew near its close, when, bearing the mangled bodies of the slaughtered family, the whole colony in solemn procession entered the humble building which had served for a church. When the six coffins were laid side by side, the burst of grief was deep and universal. The man of God waited until the waves of agony were broken. Furrows of painful thought were upon his brow, but his bearing was as one whose heart is in heaven. When there was silence, he stretched forth his hand to the people. `Ye come, as the Israelites to their passover, with loins girded, and staves in your hands, as men in haste for a journey. He who past through the land of Egypt in judgment, hath been among us. The blood of our firstborn is upon the posts and doors of our houses. Lambs without blemish have been slain, and ye this day garnish them with bitter herbs. Yet let us not go forth despairing, though we must journey beneath the cloud. We will not say, Jehovah hath forgotten us. So long the recipients of his bounty on this very spot, is it meet that we should part hence, without once more uniting in his worship? Ye know that tomorrow is the fourteenth birthday of this village. We hoped to have celebrated it with hymns of thanksgiving. Now, if our incense be robbed of its fragrance, and our melody mingled with the voices of them that weep, there is One who hath compassion upon our infirmities, and will not break the leaf driven before the tempest. `Many things press upon me to be spoken. But ye cannot bear them now. Ye are called this day to pass over the swelling of Jordan. Take the Ark of the Covenant upon your shoulders. Place yourselves beneath [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] the wing of the cherubims that overshadow it---arise and depart, for this is not your rest. `Scene of our refuge, when our native land cast us out! thou little Zoar where we prayed that we might enter from the storm of the Lord! vales where the song of our industry hath arisen! forests which have yielded to our stroke! homes of our happiness every year more dear, hallowed by the smile of joy, and the voice of supplication! we bid you all adieu. Holy church! consecrated by our humble prayers, our sacred symphonies, our hopes that rested not upon this earth, we bid thee farewell in the name of the Lord. Wherever we wander, though our tears should drop in the fountains of strange waters, never will we forget thee, our Zion in the wilderness! Lifeless remains of the brave and the beautiful, the virtuous and the beloved, severed branches! crushed blossoms! what shall we say? Ah! how often will our sorrowing hearts recall your images, as they once were---as they now are, stretched before us. What shall we say? Oh! our souls! nothing is without God. The Prophet saw him in the whirlwind, and the fire rending the rock in pieces. Though he maketh darkness his pavilion, let us wait, as those who yet hope to see the clear shining of his throne. `Souls of the departed! if ye have attained that heaven where the storm beateth not, where tears are wiped from all eyes forever; if from that clime of bliss, ye behold us, compassed with infirmity and woe, oh! teach us how slight all the thorns, the tempests, of this pilgrimage seem, now ye are at rest. My children, what avails it, where we pitch our tents for the remnant of this shadowy life, if the angel who removeth their curtains in a moment, but find the pure spirit ready to meet its God?' He ceased, and the services of devotion rose in deep and solemn response from among the people. Fathers [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] and mothers knelt amid their children, and with one voice invoked and blessed the King of kings. The memory of their sorrows and their fears arose in the soul's high aspiration, as the flame beareth on its spire the vanishing smoke towards heaven. Hands hardened with labor, and faces pale with watching, the eye of the mother and of the babe, were alike lifted upward, while they gave thanks to the Father of Mercies. Then ensued a pause of deep silence, and every head was bowed down, while the unuttered individual orison ascended. Still there was a pause. The people waited for their wonted benediction. `Part we hence,' said the pastor, `part we hence forever, without one holy song? While the fountain of our breath is unsealed, let it give praise to the Preserver.' He designated a plaintive anthem from the seventh of Job. It burst forth in sweetness, but soon the dirgelike melody became tremulous. After the strain, `Oh remember that our life is wind,' the cadence was so protracted as to be almost inaudible. Still feebly and slowly the chant proceeded; `As the cloud vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more; he shall not return to his house, his place shall know him no more.' But music could not long survive amid the swell of such agitating emotions. It trembled---one or two quivering voices prolonged it; but they sank, and tones of sorrow arose in their stead. The man of God stood up, and blessed the people, and with eyes bent to earth, led the way to the churchyard. There, upon the fresh springing turf, each coffin was laid by its open cell. Every head was humbled to the earth, while the pastor, kneeling among the graves, poured forth fervent supplications, like the prophet who lifted his censer between the dead and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] living. Tears were upon all faces, as the bodies were deposited in their narrow house. Children sobbed aloud, and groans burst from manly bosoms, when the earth, falling upon the coffins, sent forth that hollow sound, which he who hath paid the last duties to beloved dead, hath felt in his soul. Again the man of God spoke, extending his hand toward the grassy mounds that surrounded them. `Graves of our friends! those that have been long sealed, and those now enriched with new treasure, we thought that our bones should here have rested with you. Looking upon you, we have often said, Here too shall we also be gathered unto our people. Jehovah humbleth the foresight of man. He knoweth not even where his bed shall be, when this frail tabernacle falleth like a frittered garment. Yet what avails it, with what portion of clay our bodies mingle, if our souls gain the mansion prepared by their Redeemer? What avails it whether to the bosom of earth or ocean we resign the image of the earthly, if we are at last found worthy to bear the image of the heavenly? `But, oh! what were man without the promise of a resurrection! What were he, when the grave whelms his joys, but for the sure hope of eternal life! What were we, if now forced to ask in uncertainty and anguish, Who shall roll us away the stone from the the door of these sepulchres? `Mourning souls! come, return unto your God. He hath smitten, and he alone can heal. He hath troubled the waters which were at rest, but the Angel of Mercy still waiteth there, and the wounded spirits shall be made whole.' They turned from the place of sepulchres, and the next sun saw their simple habitations desolate. Not a sound of rural labor was heard, and no young children [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] were seen searching for violets which the early spring had awakened. Scarcely the striking of the Arab tents produces deeper silence, or a wider solitude. The red men of the forest roamed at will among those tenantless dwellings, wreaking an unsatisfied vengeance upon each vestige of their former inhabitants. The Huguenots, thus a second time exiled, found in Boston the welcome reception and peaceful asylum which they had anticipated. Their excellences of character were also fully appreciated, and laid the groundwork of many lasting and valuable friendships with the native Bostonians. Competence, and in some cases comparative wealth, rewarded their diligent application to business; and to this day, their descendants look back with reverence to the persevering, unostentatious virtues of their ancestors. In the course of the year 1713, the lands which they had vacated were occupied by a second colony, who retained the name of Oxford, omitting the appellation of New, which had originally been attached to it. Their house for public worship, erected four years after their return to Boston, was situated near the spot where the present Universalist Church in School Street now stands, and is designated in the records of those times, as the French Protestant Church. Father Daille continued his accustomed ministrations to his flock, winning friends by his ardent piety and affable deportment, until summoned by death to his reward, in 1715. His successor was the Reverend Andrew le Mercier, author of the `Church History of Geneva, with a Political and Geographical Account of that Republic.' In the Granary Burying Ground in Boston, the graves of the venerable `Pierre Daille and Seyre his wife,' are distinctly visible, with their simple inscriptions. But it is amid the fair scenery of Oxford, that we are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] most forcibly reminded of their images, their privations, their patience, their lives devoted to the service of God and to the good of mankind. There also a gray haired man points out to the traveller a deep hollow in the turf, and tells him, `Here stood the house of Jeanson, the French Protestant, who, with his family, perished by the Indians.' The most aged inhabitants of that pleasant vale say, that within their remembrance, the hearth stone on which the brains of those beautiful babes gushed out, still retained its crimson stain, resisting the action of the elements long after the dwelling was dilapidated by time. But among the most interesting vestiges of this settlement of the Huguenots, are the ruins of the rustic fort constructed for their defence, and bearing the antiquity of nearly a century and an half. There, within a quadrangle of ninety feet, from whence the stones have been removed for the convenience of agriculture, may still be traced the well from whence they first drew water in this foreign home. Asparagus, whose seed was originally brought from France, continues annually to burst the investing mould, a simple witness of the truth of this history; and peach and apple trees, probably the descendants of their ancient nurseries, are entwined by the coarse vine, and varied by the indigenous rose of this country. Should any one doubt the veracity of these assertions, let him explore the spot; trace, through tangled grass, the path of the persecuted emigrants; behold the monuments of their industry, their consolation, their defence; put his hand, as it were, `into the print of the nails, and be no longer faithless but believing.' Should he also to skepticism add indifference, let him seat himself upon those disjointed stones, once the rude barrier against the ruder savage; recline beneath those [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] shades so often hallowed by the prayers of Christians, recall their firmness in danger, their fortitude in affliction, their chastened joy in prosperity; impress on his imagination their image, bowing beneath perils in the wilderness for conscience' sake; and see, if, like the Lawgiver of Israel, he feel not inclined to `put his shoes from his feet, because the ground whereon he standeth is holy.' BY N. P. WILLIS. Down the green slope he bounded. Raven curls From his white shoulders by the winds were swept, And the clear rose leaf of his sunny cheek Was bright with motion. Through his open lips Shone visibly a delicate line of pearl, Like a white streaking in a tulip drawn, And his dark eye's clear brilliance, as it lay Beneath his lashes like a drop of dew Hid in the moss, stole out as covertly As starlight from the edging of a cloud. I never saw a boy so beautiful. His step was like the stooping of a bird, And his limbs melted into grace like things Shaped by the wind of summer. He was like A painter's fine conception---such an one As he would have of Ganymede, and weep Upon his pallet that he could not win The vision to his easel. Who could paint The young and shadowless spirit? Who could chain [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] The visible gladness of a heart that lives, Like a glad fountain, in the eye of light, With an unbreathing pencil? Nature's gift Has nothing that is like it. Sun and stream, And the new leaves of June, and the young lark That flees away into the depths of heaven, Lost in his own mad music, and the breath Of spring time, and the summer eve, and noon In the cool autumn, are like fingers swept Over sweet toned affections---but the joy That enters to the spirit of a child Is deep as his young heart; his very breath, The simple sense of being, is enough To ravish him, and like a thrilling touch He feels each moment of his life go by. Beautiful, beautiful childhood! with a joy That like a robe is palpable, and flung Out by your every motion! delicate bud Of the immortal flower that will unfold And come to its maturity in heaven! I weep your earthly glory. 'T is a light Lent to the new born spirit that goes out With the first idle wind. It is the leaf Fresh flung upon the river, that will dance Upon the wave that stealeth out its life, Then sink of its own heaviness. The face Of the delightful earth will to your eye Grow dim; the fragrance of the many flowers Be noticed not, and the beguiling voice Of nature in her gentleness will be To manhood's senseless ear inaudible.

The sun had set and the last faint trace Of the twilight dimly burned, When with a light and hastening pace The hunter homeward turned. He had been out on the hills all day Amidst the old gray woods, And the chase had lured him far away Into their solitudes. But now when its stirring joys were past, He thought of his pleasant home--- Of the anxious looks to the forests cast, And the prayers that he might come--- And he hastened on with a rapid tread; But the fading light was gone, And the mountain path that homeward led, Was a dark and a lonely one. And the fogs were gathering dense and chill, And the clouds shut out the moon, And the autumn winds, before so still, Sighed forth a desolate tune; And harsh low sounds were heard among The dead boughs of the trees;--- But he had dwelt on the hills too long To fear such things as these. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] Then the night owl's scream came ominously Upon the burdened air, And the hunter's heart at the boding cry Felt a superstitious fear. And he cast a timorous look before, And a timorous look behind, For a thousand fearful tales of yore, Came thronging on his mind. He had almost reached the hill where lies The Indian burial place, And his mind was full of the memories And the legends of their race. Still the branches creaked above his head, And the screechowl moaned alway, And a gloomy light the fire fly shed, And the frogs croaked out their lay. But on he urged---he was at the side Of the Indian sepulchre; \---But why doth he stop as if life's fresh tide In his heart had ceased to stir? He saw on that ancient grave uprise A form distinct and clear, And he knew by its tall gigantic size, 'T was the chief's whose bones were there. The night fogs were out upon the land, And the distant owl screeched on, When he saw the chief raise a shadowy hand, And wave him to begone. Aghast he turned---`through brook, through briar,' Full swiftly hastened he, Till he saw the light of his cottage fire Shining bright and peacefully.

We were now sailing on the Lake of the Two Mountains, here twentyfive miles broad, the waves as smooth and polished as a mirror, and gemmed with innumerable green islands. The shores were in many places bold and finely wooded, and little flourishing settlements frequently burst upon the eye, crowned by a glittering spire, and surrounded by luxuriant and well cultivated farms; while the western horizon was bounded by a range of highlands, sometimes swelling into what in this level country are termed mountains. An Indian village of considerable extent had long been in view, and we approached it just where the waters again narrowed into the channel of the Ottawa. A few canoes were lightly skimming the waves, navigated by Indians and squaws, in their fantastic dresses; and in one of these little barks, Judge Macdonald recognised Big Tom, a noted chief, preeminently distinguished by the superior splendor of his tinsel gewgaws, and the number of red feathers which decorated his head. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] These villages, for there are two, separated only by the church, are inhabited by rival tribes, the Algonquins and Six Nations. The latter were formerly the most powerful tribe in North America, and are still lords of the soil as far as the eye can reach, retaining as hunting grounds all the immense tracts of forest skirting the borders of the lake and river, possessions which are guarantied to them by the laws of the country. They spend their summers principally in roving expeditions, and return with the cold weather to enjoy the fruits of their labors. The Algonquins were a strange tribe from the banks of the Hudson, who came and took up their residence in the neighbourhood of the Six Nations. They were viewed with aversion and distrust by their powerful rivals, and frequent feuds and skirmishes took place between them. At length a deeper cause rooted the hatred which existed between them. It happened that six bold young chiefs of the Six Nations set off on a hunting expedition, in pursuit of some peculiarly obnoxious animal, that had committed great depredations on their territory; but after several days, they returned, disappointed and unsuccessful from the chase. Six young men of the Algonquins, animated by a spirit of emulation and adventure, and hoping for better success, then went privately off, in the same pursuit. They proved victorious, and were returning in triumph with the spoils of the enemy, when their rivals, jealous of the renown they would acquire, and mortified at their own defeat, treacherously waylaid, and murdered them. The relatives of the unfortunate Algonquins were too feeble to revenge their death by declaring open war against their formidable neighbours; but the injury was never forgotten, and they embraced every opportunity to annoy and harass their treacherous foe, when they could do it with impunity. It is now many years since this event happened; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] but it has not yet been forgotten or forgiven by the Algonquins. They, however, from political motives doubtless, live, in general, peaceably with the Six Nations, and even occasionally intermarry. The village belonging to the latter tribe is extensive and ancient. It was flourishing even so far back as 1611, when Monsieur Champlain penetrated into the country. That occupied by the Algonquins was first visible to us. We admired its neatness, the regularity of its houses, many of them two stories high, with steep red roofs, and the white mansion of the chief, situated on a smooth green turf, apart from the others, and surrounded by stately forest trees. We were told to suspend our admiration till we saw the rival village; and, when opposite the church, a central point, which commanded a fine view of both, we were forced to acknowledge, that it indeed exhibited marks of opulence and taste that would have honored a state of refined civilization. The tout ensemble was truly beautiful. We were not sufficiently near to distinguish objects minutely; and the distance, while it heightened the illusions of fancy, concealed all the blemishes, and disclosed only the interesting outlines of the picture. The church is a large stone building, well proportioned, and, as usual in Canada, ornamented with a tin covered spire, surmounted by a cross. Adjoining it, on each side, is a commodious range of houses, also of stone, inhabited by the priests of the respective tribes; and, in front of the whole, a noble avenue of elms stretches for a considerable distance along the bank of the river. It was a holiday; and, as we sailed slowly past, we observed a procession of priests in their black flowing robes, followed by a multitude of Indians, men and women, tricked out in feathers and glittering ornaments, with dark blankets wrapped, like cloaks, about them; each [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] hostile tribe walking with solemn steps, beneath the deep shadow of the trees, to meet and throw aside their animosities, and engage together in the imposing ceremonies of their religion. It was a picturesque and novel sight; more like a dream of enchantment, than anything I ever witnessed. We gazed till each dusky figure had disappeared from view, and the sound of the vesper bell mingled its last sweet note with the rippling of the waves. Around the village were rich pastures, fields of grain and Indian corn; and beyond it rose a thickly wooded hill of considerable height and extent, crowned by a small white chapel, which is distinctly seen from a great distance. It was placed there in commemoration of the Passion of our Saviour, and there are two of still smaller size, on the declivities of the hill. Every year great multitudes of Catholics, for they are not appropriated exclusively to Indian worshippers, walk to them in procession, and celebrate high mass and other offices of their religion. At length we came once more within view of the island of Montreal, and hailed as we would have done the familar features of a friend, its green mountains and cultivated plains, its substantial farm houses, and pretty country seats and villas. Our companion pointed out to us an object of peculiar interest to our national feelings. It was a dilapidated windmill, and the grassy remains of a fort which had fallen into the possession of our gallant General Montgomery, when he captured the island, and, near by, the ruins of a house which he took by assault. The house, it seems, was the residence of a private French gentleman, but fortified to secure it from the depredations of the Indians. The general had peremptory orders to seize upon every fortified place, and, of course, though with reluctance, felt compelled to take possession of this, which yielded without resistance. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] Fortunately for the traveller, who loves to find traces of other times, and identify them with natural scenery, it has never been rebuilt. It stands alone in a peculiarly romantic spot, half buried in the foliage of gigantic trees. I should say the walls stand; for scarcely anything else remains of what it was. They are of stone, but fast crumbling away, and fringed with moss and lichens; and the apertures, where once were windows, are twined with ivy, which curls and wreathes itself fantastically over the gray and shattered building. It was a beautiful object, and might have harmonized well with the landscapes of an older country. I had never before seen anything which could at all realize the ideas I have conceived of those European ruins which have so often charmed my imagination, and I gazed upon it till its faintest outline had melted away in the distance. About sunset we approached the St Ann rapids; we had been watching with interest the gradually increasing rapidity of the current; and, long before we reached them, the tremendous roaring of the waters burst upon our ears. All was haste and preparation. The sails were lowered, and the Canadian boatmen set up that hideous shouting and hallooing from one side of the vessel to the other, which is always a prelude to any season of peculiar danger or difficulty. The water now began to foam, and dash, and break with violence over the rocks. The captain, who seemed rather stupid, wore an uncommonly anxious look, which attracted my notice, and I asked him if he had never been over the rapids before. He replied, that it was the first time he had ever commanded the boat, but he had often sailed on the river, and knew the course. Could my heart have been appalled in the midst of so grand and beautiful a scene, his ignorance might have occasioned me some alarm, particularly as I learned that many of the crew [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] were likewise strangers; but everything was so exciting and magnificent about me, that my whole attention was absorbed, and I was only anxious to conceal the circumstance from my companions, who discovered a slight uneasiness, and proposed going on shore; a plan I had no wish to adopt. However, we safely passed the rapids; the boat plunged, and for an instant almost sunk in the waves that curled and dashed around her. Every tongue was silent, and never did I experience a sensation of such mingled awe and delight. We looked back upon the fearful pitch, with emotions which it is impossible to describe. The angry element, bathed in the rich crimson of the setting sun, was lashing itself to fury, and, in the midst of the most frightful breakers, appeared a little bark canoe, whose progress we watched with intense interest. One moment it rode triumphantly on the summit of a foaming billow, the next sunk almost from view, apparently too fragile to withstand the overwhelming torrent. But it bravely weathered the host of dangers which beset it, and, shooting swiftly past us, soon left our more sluggish vessel far behind. We were now passing the pretty village of St Ann's. Its church, standing on a little promontory, extending into the rapids, was a most pleasing object, a beacon in the midst of rocks and dangers. Just at this time, the wind again subsided, and left us totally becalmed. Night was fast approaching, and we began to grow impatient; for we had entered the St Lawrence, at the end of the island, and from thence to La Chine its navigation is rather difficult. The captain, we were now convinced, knew little of it, as in confirmation of our previous suspicions, Miss --- heard the Judge say to him, just after we passed the rapids, `Why did you come over that steep pitch? It was not the right channel.' To which he replied, `It was the helmsman's fault; he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] never been over before, and knew nothing about it.' Many of the sailors also were half intoxicated; they had amused themselves, during the calm in the morning, with drinking perpetually, and had become noisy and rude, and were unwilling to use their oars. At the foot of the rapids, Judge Macdonald showed us the spot where a most dreadful accident happened in the spring. Mr and Mrs H., with three children and three female servants, were passing down the river, on their way to Quebec. They landed, and walked past the rapids; but as the children complained of fatigue, returned to the boat too soon, and were but a few yards from the shore, when one of the boatmen, who was intoxicated, by an unskilful use of the oar created an eddy which tipped the canoe on one side. This alarmed the servants, who, instead of remaining quiet, rose suddenly up, and by their imprudence completely overset the boat. Mr H., who was an excellent swimmer, seized one of the children but a wave washed it instantly from his arms. He remained in the water a long time, vainly searching for the remainder of his family, till entirely exhausted he was compelled to go on shore, but in a state bordering on distraction. Mrs H., however, was most providentially preserved. On dragging the canoe to land she was discovered fastened in between the seats, but lifeless and benumbed by her long submersion. Her recovery, which was almost unhoped for, seemed miraculous, and it was long before they dared to inform her of the dreadful extent of her loss. Her husband was obliged to dissemble and stifle his agony in her presence, but in private it nearly overpowered his reason. They shortly after this dreadful event, proceeded to Quebec. The bodies of the children were found, brought to town, and buried. One of the servant women escaped, the others never rose. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] Soon after passing this melancholy spot, we met a large Durham boat, under full sail, streamers flying, and a band of music playing delightfully. There was a merry party on board, and among them some gentlemen of our acquaintance, who saluted us with Yankee Doodle as they passed. They were striving to clear the rapids before dark. These were the scenes in which Moore composed, or rather imitated from the French, his beautiful Canadian boat song. `Soon as the woods on shore look dim, We 'll sing at St Ann's our parting hymn; Row, brothers, row---the stream runs fast, The rapids are near, and the daylight 's past.' Night had now closed around us, and for two or three hours we made so little progress, that we began to fear we should be obliged to remain on board all night. We wished to be put ashore at Point St Clair, but the captain said the shoals were dangerous, and he did not like to venture. We were soon however relieved from our apprehensions, as the wind again rose, and a stiff breeze wafted us swiftly onward. It was a bright starlight night; not a cloud was visible on the stainless azure above us, and the dancing waves beneath sparkled with the reflected glories of the heavens. Lights were seen along the shore, and now and then showed us a small village or solitary cottage in the midst of surrounding gloom. Judge Macdonald sang several Highland songs in Gaelic. His voice was rich and well modulated, and there was a wild sweetness in the airs that well accorded with the time and place. The captain and mate held repeated consultations respecting the situation of La Chine. We found they had entirely mistaken it, and there were some on board who thought we had passed it. Poor M., whose head [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] still continued to ache, fancied we were approaching the La Chine rapids, and even declared she could hear their roar. We afterwards found that stouter hearts among us, had entertained the same fear. About midnight, however, we entered the desired haven and in a few minutes were comfortably established for the night in a neat tavern. We rose at six the next morning, and after a pleasant ride of nine miles, reached the good and loyal city of Montreal with keen appetites for breakfast. Our friends had all arrived on the preceding evening, and we soon after met to discuss our various adventures. BY N. P. WILLIS. Sogna il guerrier le schiere , Le selve il cacciator ; E sogna il pescator Le reti, e l' amo . METASTASIO. Love knoweth every form of air, And every shape of earth, And comes, unbidden, everywhere, Like thought's mysterious birth. The moonlight sea and the sunset sky Are written with Love's words, And you hear his voice unceasingly, Like song in the time of birds. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] He peeps into the warrior's heart From the tip of a stooping plume, And the serried spears, and the many men May not deny him room. He 'll come to his tent in the weary night, And be busy in his dream; And he 'll float to his eye in morning light Like a fay on a silver beam. He hears the sound of the hunter's gun, And rides on the echo back, And sighs in his ear like a stirring leaf, And flits in his woodland track. The shade of the wood, and the sheen of the river, The cloud, and the open sky--- He will haunt them all with his subtle quiver, Like the light of your very eye. The fisher hangs over the leaning boat, And ponders the silver sea, For Love is under the surface hid, And a spell of thought has he. He heaves the wave like a bosom sweet, And speaks in the ripple low, Till the bait is gone from the crafty line, And the hook hangs bare below. He blurs the print of the scholar's book, And intrudes in the maiden's prayer, And profanes the cell of the holy man, In the shape of a lady fair. In the darkest night, and the bright daylight, In earth, and sea, and sky, In every home of human thought, Will Love be lurking nigh.

How peacefully yon winding brook Along the cemetery flows, As if its waters paused to look Where sleep the dead in household rows. Wild lilies fringe its wayward path, And lean upon each mouldering tomb; But round one spot the verdure hath A richer and a fresher bloom. And softer by the wind hath gone, While, by the parting sunset flame, I clear the long grass from the stone, To trace the epitaph and name--- And well those flowers may freshlier blow, The low wind hush its whispering tongue; For he who slumbereth below Was gifted with the fire of song. That name! how much it tells of one Whose mind, though bright with glorious rays Direct from heaven, yet beamed unknown, Nor drew the world's enchanted gaze; Who, far above men's winning art, Their fame and fortunes to exalt, Would never bow his noble heart--- Excess of honor was his fault. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] I knew him well, when hoary age Had blanched his locks, and, by the hearth, Have often bent to hear the sage Floods of wild eloquence pour forth. And while in visionary trance His rapid numbers smoothly rolled, He seemed, in voice and countenance, Inspired as were the bards of old. And worthy of their harps was he--- Worthy to wake, with them, the grand War anthem, or the music free Of love, with burning lip and hand, But silently he passed away, Like thought unuttered, and his lyre Was hushed, till angel hands should play The notes immortal themes inspire. Yet it is sweet, 't is passing sweet, When living, our own praise to hear, And see, in raptures, at our feet, Woman, the genius worshipper; And feel and know that, after death, The great, the beautiful, and brave, Will come to hang the laurel wreath, And drop a tear upon our grave. Grave of an unknown Genius!---blest Be the cold pillow of his sleep--- Still may strange visions gild his rest, Like those which nightly used to sweep Around his couch, in radiance Immortal, when, though sealed, his eyes, With fancy's telescopic glance, Pierced the blue curtain of the skies, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] And saw, as in a mystic glass, Pictures of woods and amber streams, In twilight, classic vistas pass, And caught celestial tinted gleams Of fair faced daughters, whose bright hair Like robes of sunlight round them hung, And bathed their ivory bodies there, While back his rapturous gaze they flung. Voices and viols, too, from high, Came stealing to his ravished ear, In cadences of ecstacy, So sweet, 't were almost death to hear; And secrets of the other world, The orbs, and those who in them dwell, Were, like a burning scroll, unfurled, And told what mortal might not tell. Nature, not less, with day dreams true Of living joys, oft thrilled his frame; From every passing hour he drew Deep lessons, as in glory came Spring with its silver sea of flowers, Summer's majestic thunder cloud, Gorgeous autumn's hectic hours, And winter's universal shroud. Born with a shape of kingly mould, An eye, where light ethereal flashed, A brow of marble, high and bold, That vulgar minds with awe abashed--- Why, from yon lonely poplar vale, Where smiled his cottage through the trees, Came forth no minstrel to regale The world with holy rhapsodies? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] Oh! all availed not. Still his lyre Hung silent to the world around; None, save the happy cherub choir Of heaven, were conscious of its sound--- As angels oft view many a star, And catch its music's golden tone, While ray and song to mortals are Both undiscovered and unknown. BY H. PICKERING. Primeval shades! and ye, majestic woods, Implanted not by man, but from time's dawn Successive reared by an Almighty hand, O welcome to my soul! Your silence breathes Of peace; while from your inmost depths the voice Of Nature seems, in whisper soft, to say,--- `These shadowy realms are all my own.' A scene How wild, how solemn, how magnificent! 'Mid these interminable columns, gray With the slow lapse of centuries, the eye Is lost; or when upraised, may strive in vain To penetrate the dense and leafy roof That like another firmament extends High over head. Even the sun's piercing beams Fall powerless here; and though they fire the heavens, The twilight of the woods they still refuse To dissipate. And then what stillness reigns! Not a leaf stirs; and the few living things Are motionless. Near where a moss clad trunk Extends its bulk immense along the earth, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] A solitary hare, with eye askance, Though silent and unmoved, is couched; the while At measured intervals, the hermit bird [2] Breathes forth, in secret, its sweet, mournful note, Which dying, falls upon the ear, yet not Disturbs the deep serene. With voice subdued, I too pour out the promptings of my heart, And reverent tread the hallowed ground. O God! How all unworthy are the proudest fanes For thine exalted worship, when compared With temples such as this. Vainglorious man, Or in Ionic grace, or florid pomp Corinthian, or severer Doric pride, The marble fabric rears, and dedicates Ostensibly to thee, yet secret boasts His forming hand; but thy majestic works In silent grandeur rise, which heaven's bright hosts With awe behold, and hymn eternal praise. And shall not he thou fashionedst from the dust, And `with surpassing beauty crowned,' thy power Omnipotent confess, and grateful sound Through every land the sovereign truth, `Thou reignest?' Thou art---and were man's lips forever sealed, That truth immutable would be promulged. The earth, the invisible air, and the blue depths Of ocean, all evolve it; 't is inscribed In golden characters amid the stars; And every orb that rolls sublime, repeats This to the listening ear; but 'mid these shades It sinks with awe upon the heart. Once too, Ye feather-cinctured race, it fell on yours; And your stern souls, struck with religious dread, Prostrate even here, where now I stand, adored The one, Great Spirit! Be it not then said [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] That Nature her magnificence in vain Had lavished on the desert. Lakes immense, Like mirrors spread beneath the azure heavens--- Rivers, 'mid thousand tributary streams, Rolling in tranquil majesty along--- Sky-propping mountains, and impetuous floods Bounding from steep to steep into the vales--- But more than all, the immeasurable wild Covering with leafy labyrinths and shade Mysterious the wide land---a faith sublime Instilled, and led the Indian up to God. Yet did he not refrain from murderous strife; But 'mid these glorious scenes, 'mid Nature's forms August---worthy themselves to be adored--- Hath steeled his heart, and dyed with human gore The virgin earth. What wonder, when the sons Of polished Europe wage insatiate war, When they, the followers of the Prince of Peace, Cease not, malevolent, to betray, oppress, And slay their fellows, that the undaunted race, Who held a dubious empire o'er the wild, By latent foes encompassed should delight In mortal combat. O Almighty God! Hide me from scenes of carnage; temper thou Full soon, `man's inhumanity to man,' And fill my soul with pity for the oppressed. Nor be this all; O lead me oft to thee; Give me to wander 'mid these shady haunts, Henceforth retreats of peace; and with the inspired Of every age, as with the uncultured tribes Of nature, to adore thee in thy works, And in the grandeur and the beauty here, To view the type of a more glorious world.

I thus assume the dramatic prerogative of introducing my readers at once to the scene of my story, and with the same time saving privilege I introduce my dramatis person ae , a gentleman and lady promenading the deck with the slow step so natural on a summer's night, when your company is agreeable. The lady leaned familiarly on the arm of her companion as they walked to and fro, sometimes looking at the moon, and sometimes at her pretty feet, as they stole out, one after the other, into the moonlight. She was a tall, queenly person, somewhat embonpoint , but extremely graceful. Her eye was of a dark blue, shaded with lashes of remarkable length, and her features, though irregular, were expressive of great vivacity, and more than ordinary talent. She wore her hair, which was of a deep chestnut, in the Madonna style, simply parted, and her dress, throughout, had the chaste elegance of good taste---the tournure of fashion without its extravagance. Her companion was a tall, well formed young man, very handsome, with a frank and prepossessing expression of countenance, and the fine freedom of step and air, which characterize the well bred gentleman. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] was dressed fashionably, but plainly, and wore whiskers, in compliance with the prevailing mania. His tone was one of rare depth and melody; and as he bent slightly and gracefully to the lady's ear, its low, rich tenderness had the irresistible fascination, for which the human voice is sometimes so remarkable. It was a beautiful night. The light lay sleeping on the St Lawrence like a white mist. The boat, on whose deck our acquaintances were promenading, was threading the serpentine channel of the `Thousand Isles,' more like winding through a wilderness than following the passage of a great river. The many thousand islands clustered in this part of the St Lawrence seem to realize the mad girl's dream when she visited the stars, and found them `---only green islands, sown thick in the sky.' Nothing can be more like fairy land than sailing among them on a summer's evening. They vary in size, from a quarter of a mile in circumference, to a spot just large enough for one solitary tree, and are at different distances, from a bowshot to a gallant leap from each other. The universal formation is a rock of horizontal stratum, and the river, though spread into a lake by innumerable divisions, is almost embowered by the luxuriant vegetation which covers them. There is everywhere sufficient depth for the boat to run directly alongside, and with the rapidity and quietness of her motion, and the near neighborhood of the trees, which may almost be touched, the illusion of aerial carriage over land, is, at first, almost perfect. The passage through the more intricate parts of the channel, is, if possible, still more beautiful. You shoot into narrow passes where you could spring on shore on either side, catching, as you advance, hasty views to the right [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] and left, through long vistas of islands; or, running round a projecting point of rock or woodland, open into an apparent lake, and darting rapidly across, seem running right on shore as you enter a narrow strait in pursuit of the covert channel. It is the finest ground in the world for the `magic of moonlight.' The water is clear, and, on the night we speak of, was a perfect mirror. Every star was repeated. The foliage of the islands was softened into indistinctness, and they lay in the water, with their well defined shadows hanging darkly beneath them, as distinctly as clouds in the sky, and apparently as moveable. In more terrestrial company than the lady Viola's, our hero might have fancied himself in the regions of upper air; but as he leant over the tafferel, and listened to the sweetest voice that ever melted into moonlight, and watched the shadows of the dipping trees as the approach of the boat broke them one by one, he would have thought twice before he had said that he was sailing on a fresh water river, in the good steam boat Queenston. Miss Viola Clay and Mr Frank Gresham, the hero and heroine of this true story, I should have told you before, were cousins. They had met lately after a separation of many years, and as the lady had in the mean time become the proudest woman in the world, and the gentleman had been abroad and wore whiskers, and had, besides, a cousin's carte blanche for his visits, there was reason to believe they would become very well acquainted. Frank had been at home but a few months when he was invited to join the party with which he was now making the fashionable tour. He had seen Viola every day since his return, and had more to say to her than to all the rest of his relatives together. He would sit for hours with her in the deep recesses of the windows, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] telling his adventures when abroad. At least, it was so presumed, as he talked all the time, and she was profoundly attentive. It was thought, too, he must have seen some affecting sights, for now and then his descriptions made her sigh audibly, and once the color was observed to mount to her very temples---doubtless from strong sympathy with some touching distress. Frank joined the party for the tour, and had, at the time we speak of, been several weeks in their company. They had spent nearly a month among the Lakes, and were now descending by their grand outlet to Montreal. Many a long walk had been taken, and many a romantic scene had been gazed upon during their absence, and the lady had, many a time, wandered away with her cousin, doubtless for the want of a more agreeable companion. She was indefatigable in seeing the celebrated places from every point, and made excursions which the gouty feet of her father, or the etiquette of a stranger's attendance would have forbidden. In these cases Frank's company was evidently a convenience; and over hill and dale, through glen and cavern, he had borne her delicate arm by the precious privilege of cousinship. There's nothing like a cousin. It is the sweetest relation in human nature. There is no excitement in loving your sister, and courting a lady in the face of a strange family requires the nerve of a martyr; but your dear familiar cousin, with her provoking maidenly reserve, and her bewitching freedoms, and the romping frolics, and the stolen tenderness over the skein of silk that will get tangled---and then the long rides which nobody talks about, and the long t ete-a-tetes which are nobody's business, and the long letters of which nobody pays the postage---no, there is nothing like a cousin--- a young, gay, beautiful witch of a cousin! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] Till within a few days Frank had enjoyed a monopoly of the lady Viola's condescensions; but their party had been increased lately by a young gentleman who introduced himself to papa as the son of an old friend, and proceeded immediately to a degree of especial attention which relieved our hero exceedingly of his duties. Mr Erastus Van Pelt was a tall, thin person with an aquiline nose, and a forehead that retreated till it was lost in the distance. It was evident at the first glance that he was high ton . The authenticity of his style, even on board a steam boat, distanced imitation immeasurably. The angle of his bow had been an insoluble problem from his d ebut at the dancing school till the present moment, and his quizzing glass was thrown up to his eye with a grace that would have put Brummel to the blush. From the square toe of his pump to the loop of his gold chain he was a perfect wonder. Every body smiled on Mr Erastus Van Pelt. This accomplished gentleman looked with an evil eye on our hero. He had the magnanimity not to cut him outright, as he was the lady's cousin; but tolerated him on the first day with a cold civility, which he intended should amount to a cut on the second. Frank thought him thus far very amusing; but when he came frequently in the way of his attentions to his cousin, and once or twice raised his glass at his remarks, with the uncomprehending `Sir!' he was observed to stroke his black whiskers with a very ominous impatience. Further acquaintance by no means mended the matter, and Frank's brow grew more and more cloudy. He had already alarmed Mr Van Pelt with a glance of his eye that could not be mistaken, and anticipated his `cut direct' by at least some hours, when the lady Viola took him aside and bound over his thumb and finger to keep the peace toward the invisible waist of his adversary. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] A morning or two after this precaution, the boat was bending in toward a small village which terminates the safe navigation above the rapids of the Split Rock. Coaches were waiting on shore, to convey passengers to the next still water, and the mixed population of the little village, attracted by the arrival, was gathered in a picturesque group on the landing. There was the Italian looking Canadian with his clear olive complexion and open neck, his hat slouched carelessly, and the indispensable red sash hanging from his waist; and the still, statue like Indian with the incongruous blanket and belt, hat and moccasin costume of the border, and the tall, inquisitive looking Vermontese---all mingled together like the figures of a painter's study. Miss Clay sat on the deck, surrounded by her party. Frank, at a little distance, stood looking into the water with the grave intentness of a statue, and Mr Van Pelt levelled his glass at the `horrid creatures' on shore, and expressed his elegant abhorrence of their savaugerie in a fine spun falsetto . As its last thin tone melted, he turned and spoke to the lady with an air evidently more familiar than her dignity for the few first days seemed to have warranted. There was an expression of ill concealed triumph in his look, and an uncompromised turning of his back on our penseroso , which indicated an advance in relative importance; and though Miss Clay went on with the destruction of her card of distances just as if there was nobody in the world but herself, the conversation was well sustained till the last musical superlative was curtailed by the whiz of the escape valve. As the boat touched the pier, Frank awoke from his reverie, and announced his intention of taking a boat down the rapids. Viola objected to it at first as a dangerous experiment; but when assured by him that it was perfectly safe, and that the boat, during the whole [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] passage, would be visible from the coach, she opposed it no further. Frank then turned to Mr Van Pelt, and to her astonishment, politely requested his company. The dandy was thunderstruck. To his comprehension it was like offering him a private interview with a bear. `No, sir,' said he, with a nervous twirl of his glass round his forefinger. Miss Clay, however, insisted on his acceptance of the invitation. The prospect of his company without the restraint of Frank's presence, and a wish to foster the good feeling from which she thought the offer proceeded, were sufficient reasons for perseverance, and on the ground that his beautiful cap was indispensable to the picturesque effect, she would take no denial. Most reluctantly his consent was at last given, and Frank sprang on shore with an accommodating readiness to find boatmen for the enterprise. He found his errand a difficult one. The water was uncommonly low, and at such times the rapids are seldom passed, even by the most daring. The old voyageurs received his proposition with shrugs and volumes of patois , in which he could only distinguish adjectives of terror. By promises of extravagant remuneration, however, he prevailed on four athletic Canadians to row him to Coteau du Lac. He then took them aside, and by dint of gesture and bad French, made them comprehend, that he wished to throw his companion into the river. They had no shadow of objection. For a `consideration,' they would upset the bateau in a convenient place below the rapids, and ensure Mr Van Pelt's subsequent existence at the forfeiture of the reward. A simultaneous ` Gardez vous! ' was to be the signal for action. The coaches had already started when Frank again stood on the pier, and were pursuing slowly the beautiful road on the bank of the river. He almost repented [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] his rash determination for a moment, but the succeeding thought was one of pride, and he sprang lightly into the bateau at the ` Allons! ' of the impatient boatmen. Mr Van Pelt was already seated, and as they darted rapidly away with the first stroke of the oars, the voyageur at the helm commenced a low recitative. At every alternate line, the others joined in a loud, but not inharmonious chorus, and the strokes were light or deep as the leader indicated, by his tone, the necessity of rapidity or deliberation. In a few minutes they reached the tide, and as the boat swept violently in, the oars were shipped, and the boatmen, crossing themselves and mumbling a prayer to the saint, sat still, and looked anxiously forward. It was evidently much worse than Mr Van Pelt had anticipated. Frank remarked upon the natural beauties of the river, but he had no eye for scenery. He sat on a low seat, grasping the sides of the boat with a tenacity as unphilosophical as it was out of character for his delicate fingers. The bateau glided like a bird round the island which divides the river, and, steering for the middle of the stream, was in a moment, hurrying with its whole velocity onward. The Split Rock was as yet far below, but the intermediate distance was a succession of rapids, and, though not much dreaded by those accustomed to the navigation, they were to a stranger sufficiently appalling. The river was tossed like a stormy sea, and the large waves, thrown up from the sunken rocks, came rolling back upon the tide, and, dashing over the boat, flung her off like a tiny shell. Mr Van Pelt was in a profuse perspiration. His knees, drawn up to his head by the acute angle of his posture, knocked violently together, and no persuasion could induce him to sit in the depressed stern for the accommodation of the voyageurs. He sat right in the centre of the bateau, and kept his eye on the waves [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] with a manifest distrust of Providence, and an anxiety that betrayed a culpable want of resignation. The bateau passed the travellers on shore as she neared the rock. Frank waved his handkerchief triumphantly. The water just ahead roared and leaped up in white masses like a thousand monsters; and, at the first violent whirl, he was pulled down by a voyageur, and commanded imperatively to lie still. Another and another shock followed in quick succession, and she was perfectly unmanageable. The helmsman threw himself flat on the bottom. Mr Van Pelt hid his face in his hands, and crouched beside him. The water dashed in, and the bateau, obeying every impulse, whirled and flung from side to side like a feather. It seemed as if every plunge must be the last. One moment she shivered and stood motionless, struck back by a violent blow, and the next, shot down into an abyss with an arrowy velocity that seemed like instant destruction. Frank shook off the grasp of the voyageur, and, holding on to the side, half rose to his feet. ` Gardez vous!  ' exclaimed the voyageur; and, mistaking the caution for the signal, with a sudden effort he seized Mr Van Pelt, and, plunging him over the side, leaped in after him. ` Diable! ' muttered the helmsman, as the dandy, with a piercing shriek, sprang half out of water, and disappeared instantly. But the Split Rock was right beneath the bow, and like a shot arrow the boat sprang through the gorge, and in a moment was gliding among the masses of foam in the smooth water. They put back immediately, and at a stroke or two against the current, up came the scientific `brutus' of Mr Van Pelt, quite out of curl, and crested with the foam through which he had emerged to a thinner element. There was no mistaking its identity, and it was rudely seized by the voyageur with a tolerable certainty that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf414v1&image=414-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] the ordinary sequel would follow. All reasoning upon anomalies, however, is uncertain, and to the terror of the unlettered captor, down went un gentilhomme , leaving the envy of the world in his possession. He soon reappeared, and with his faith in the unity of Monsieur considerably shaken, the voyageur lifted him carefully into the bateau. My dear reader! were you ever sick? Did you have a sweet cousin, or a young aunt, or any pretty friend who was not your sister or your mother, for a nurse? And do you remember how like an angel's fingers, her small white hand laid on your forehead, and how thrillingly her soft voice spoke low in your ear, and how inquiringly her fair face hung over your pillow? If you have not, and remember no such passages, it were worth half your sound constitution, and half your uninteresting health, and half your long life, to have had that experience. Talk of moonlight in a bower, and poetry in a boudoir \---there is no atmosphere for love like a sick chamber, and no poetry like the persuasion to your gruel, or the sympathy for your aching head, or your feverish forehead. Three months after Frank Gresham was taken out of the St Lawrence, he was sitting in a deep recess with the lady, who, to the astonishment of the whole world, had accepted him as her lover. `Miss Viola Clay,' said our hero with a look of profound resignation, `when will it please you to attend to certain responses you wot of?' The answer was in a low sweet tone, inaudible to all save the ear for which it was intended.
