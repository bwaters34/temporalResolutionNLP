 Good Master H. I doubt not but you haue some great important matter in hande, which al this while restraineth youre Penne, and wonted readinesse in prouoking me vnto that, wherein your selfe nowe faulte. If there bee any such thing in hatching, I pray you hartily, lette vs knowe, before al the worlde see it. But if happly you dwell altogither in Iustinians Courte, and giue your selfe to be deuoured of secreate Studies, as of all likelyhood you doe: yet at least imparte some your olde, or newe, Latine, or Englishe, Eloquent and Gallant Poesies to vs, from whose eyes, you saye, you keepe in a manner nothing hidden. Little newes is here stirred: but that olde greate matter still depending. His Honoure neuer better. I thinke the Earthquake was also there wyth you (which I would gladly learne) as it was here with vs: ouerthrowing diuers old buildings, and peeces of Churches. Sure verye straunge to be hearde of in these Countries, and yet I heare some saye (I knowe not howe truely) that they Philosophis ? I like your late Englishe Hexameters so exceedingly well, that I also enure my Penne sometime in that kinde: whyche I fynd indeede, as I haue heard you often defende in worde, neither so harde, nor so harshe, that it will easily and fairely, yeelde it selfe to oure Moother tongue. For the onely, or chiefest hardnesse, whych seemeth, is in the Accente: whyche sometime gapeth, and as it were yawneth ilfauouredly, comming shorte of that it should, and sometime exceeding the measure of the Number, as in shall be read long in verse, seemeth like  a lame Gosling, that draweth one legge after hir: and Heauen, beeing vsed shorte as one sillable, when it is in verse, stretched out with a Diastole , is like a lame Dogge that holdes vp one legge. But it is to be wonne with Custome, and rough words must be subdued with Vse. For, why a Gods name may not we, as else the Greekes, haue the kingdome of oure owne Language, and measure our Accentes, by the sounde, reseruing the Quantitie to the Uerse? Loe here I let you see my olde vse of toying in Rymes, turned into your artificial straightnesse of Uere, by this Tetrasticon . I beseech you tell me your fancie, without parcialitie. See yee the blindefoulded pretie God, that feathered Archer, Of Louers Miseries which maketh his bloodie Game? Wote ye why, his Moother with a Veale hath coouered his Face? Trust me, least he my Looue happely chaunce to beholde. Seeme they comparable to those two, which I translated you ex tempore in bed, the last time we lay togither in Westminster? That which I eate, did I ioy, and that which I greedily gorged, As for those many goodly matters leaft I for others. I would hartily wish, you would either send me the Rules and Precepts of Arte, which you obserue in Quantities, or else followe mine, that M. Philip Sidney gaue me, being the very same which M. Drant deuised, but enlarged with M. Sidneys own iudgement, and augmented with my Obseruations, that we might both accorde and agree in one: leaste we ouerthrowe one an other, and be ouerthrown of the rest. Truste me, you will hardly beleeue what greate good liking and estimation Maister Dyer had of youre Satyricall Verses, and I, since the viewe thereof, hauing before of my selfe had speciall liking of Englishe Versifying, am euen nowe aboute to giue you some token, what, and howe well therein I am able to doe: for, to tell you trueth, I minde shortely at conuenient leysure, to sette forth a Booke in this kinde, whyche I entitle, Epithalamion Thamesis , whyche Booke I dare vndertake wil be very profitable for the knowledge, and rare for the Inuention, and manner of handling. For in setting forth the marriage of the Thames: I shewe his first beginning, and offspring, and all the Countrey, that he passeth thorough, and also describe all the Riuers throughout Englande, whyche came to this Wedding, and their righte names, and right passage, &c. A worke beleeue me, of much labour, wherein notwithstanding Master Holinshed hath muche furthered and aduantaged me, who therein hath bestowed singular paines, in searching oute their firste heades, and sourses: and also in tracing, and dogging oute all their Course, til they fall into the Sea, O Tite, siquid, ego, Ecquid erit pretij? being fully finished (as I partelye signified in my laste Letters) and presentlye to bee imprinted, I wil in haude forthwith with my Faery Queene, whyche I praye you hartily send me with al expedition: and your frendly Letters, and long expected Iudgement wythal, whyche let not be shorte, but in all pointes suche, as you ordinarilye vse, and I extraordinarily desire. Multum vale. Westminster. Quarto Nonas Aprilis 1580. Sed, amabo te, Meum Corculum tibi se ex animo commendat plurim um: iamaiu mirata, te nihil ad literas suas responsi dedisse.

Yours alwayes to commaunde IMMERITO. of the Glosse, (runing continually in maner of a Paraphrase) full as great as my Calendar. Therin be some things excellently, and many things wittily discoursed of E. K., fl. 1573 and the Pictures so singularly set forth, and purtrayed, as if Michael Angelo were there, he could (I think) nor amende the best, nor reprehende the worst. I know you woulde lyke them passing wel. Of my Stemmata Dudleiana , and especially of the sundry Apostrophes therein, addressed you knowe to whome, muste more aduisement be had, than so lightly to sende them abroade: howbeit, trust me (though I doe neuer very well,) yet in my owne fancie, I neuer dyd better:  Veruntamen te sequor sol um: nunquam vero assequar. last. Signor Immerito, after as many gentle Godmorrowes, as your self, and your sweete Harte listeth: May it please your Maistershippe to dispense with a poore Oratour of yours, for breaking one principall graund Rule of our olde inuiolable Rules of Rhetorick, in shewing himselfe somewhat too pleasurably disposed in a sad matter: (of purpose, to meete with A coople of shrewde wittie new marryed Gentlewomen, which were more Inquisitiue, than Capable of Natures works) I will report you a prettie conceited discourse, that I had with them no longer agoe, than yesternight, in a Gentlemans house, here in Essex. Where being in the company of certaine curteous Gentlemen, and those two Gentlewomen, it was my chaunce to be well occupyed, I warrant you, at Cardes, (which I dare saye I scarcely handled a whole tweluemoonth before) at that very instant, that the Earth vnder vs quaked, and the house shaked aboue: besides the moouing, and ratling of the Table, and fourmes, where wee sat. Wherevpon, the two Gentlewomen hauing continually beene wrangling with all the rest, and especially with my selfe, and euen at that same very moment, making a great loude noyse, and much a doo: Good Lorde, quoth I, is it not woonderful straunge that the delicate voyces of two so propper fine Gentlewoomen, shoulde make such a suddayne terrible Earthquake? Imagining in good fayth, nothing in the worlde lesse, than that it shoulde be any Earthquake in deede, and imputing that shaking to the suddayne sturring, and remoouing of some cumberous thing or other, in the vpper Chamber ouer our Heades: which onely in effect most of vs noted, scarcely perceyuing the rest, beeing so closely and eagerly set at our game, and some of vs taking on, as they did. But beholde, all on the suddayne there commeth stumbling into the Parlour, the Gentleman of the house, somewhat straungely affrighted, and in a manner all agast, and telleth vs, as well as his Head and Tongue woulde giue him leaue, what a woonderous violent motion, and shaking there was of all things in his Hall: sensibly and visibly seene, as well of his owne selfe, as of many of his Seruauntes, and Neighbours there. I straite wayes beginnyng to thinke somewhat more seriously of the matter: Then I pray you, good Syr, quoth I, send presently one of your seruauntes farther into the Towne, to enquire, if the like hath happened there, as most likely is, and then must it needes be some Earthquake. Whereat the good fearefull Gentleman being a little recomforted, (as misdoubting, and dreading before, I knowe not what in his owne House, as many others did) and immediately dispatching his man into the Towne, wee had by and by certayne woord, that it was generall ouer all the Towne, and within lesse than a quarter of an howre after, that the very like behappened the next Towne too, being a farre greater and goodlyer Towne. The Gentlewoomens hartes nothing acquaynted with any such Accidentes, were maruellously daunted: and they, that immediately before were so eagerly, and greedily praying on vs, began nowe forsooth, very demurely, and deuoutely to pray vnto God, and the one especially, that was euen nowe in the House toppe, I bes eeche you hartily quoth shee, let vs leaue off playing, and fall a praying. By my truely, I was neuer so scared in myselfe, Me thinkes it maruellous straunge. What good Partener? Cannot you pray to your selfe, quoth one of the Gentlemen, but all the House must heare you, and ring Allin to our Ladyes Mattins? I see woomen are euery way vehement, and affectionate. Your selfe was liker euen nowe, to make a fraye, than to pray: and will you nowe needes in all hast bee on both your knees? Let vs, and you say it, first dispute the matter, what daunger, and terror it carryeth with it. God be praysed, it is already ceased, and heere be some present, that are able cunningly, and clearkly to argue the case. I beseeche you master, or mystresse, your zealous and deuoute Passion a while. And with that turning to me, and smiling a little at the first: Nowe I pray you, Master H. what say you Philosophers quoth he, to this suddayne Earthquake? May there not be some sensible Naturall cause therof, in the concauities of the Earth it self, as some forcible and violent Eruption of wynde, or the like? Yes no doubt, sir, may there, quoth I, as well, as an Intelligible Supernaturall: and peraduenture the great aboundaunce and superfluitie of waters, that fell shortly after Michaelmas last, beeyng not as yet dryed, or drawen vp with the heate of the Sunne, which hath not yet recouered his full attractiue strength and power, might minister some occasion thereof, as might easily be discoursed by Naturall Philosophie, in what sorte the poores, and ventes, and crannies of the Earth being so stopped, and fylled vp euery where with moysture, that the windie Exhaltations, and Uapors, pent vp as it were in the bowels thereof, could not otherwise get out, and ascende to their Naturall Originall place. But the Termes of Arte, and verye Natures of things themselues so vtterly unknowen, as they are to most heere, it were a peece of woorke to laye open the Reason to euery ones Capacitie. I know well, it is we that you meane, quoth one of ye Gentlewomen (whom for distinction sake, and bicause I imagine they would be loath to be named, I will hereafter call, Mystresse Inquisitiua, and the other, Madame Incredula:) now I beseeche you, learned Syr, try our wittes a little, and let vs hear a peece of your deepe Uniuersitie Cunning. Seeing you Gentlewomen will allgates haue it so, with a good will, quoth I: and then forsooth, very solemnly pawsing a whyle, most grauely, and doctorally proceeded, as followeth. The Earth you knowe, is a mightie great huge body, and consisteth of many diuers, and contrarie members, & vaines, and arteries, and concauities, wherein to aubide the absurditie of Vacuum , most necessarily be very great store of substantiall matter, and sundry Accidentall humours, & fumes, and spirites, either good, or bad,or mixte. Good they cannot possibly all be, whereout is ingendred so much bad, as namely so many poysonfull, and venemous Hearbes,and Beastes, besides a thousand infectiue, and contagious thinges else. If they be bad, bad you must needes graunt is subject to bad, and then can there not, I warrant you, want an Object, for bad to worke vpon. If mixt, which seemeth most probable, yet is it impossible,that there should be such an equall,and proportionable Temperature, in all, and singular respectes, but sometime the Euill (in the diuels name,) will as it were interchaungeably haue his naturall Predominaunt Course, and issue one way, or other. Which euill working vehemently in the partes, and malitiously encountering the good, forcibly tosseth, and cruelly disturbeth the whole: Which conflict indureth so long,and is fostred with aboundaunce of corrupt putrified Humors, and ylfauourd grosse infected matter, that it must needes (as well, or rather as ill, as in mens and womens bodyes) brust out in the ende into one perillous disease or other, and sometime, for want of Naturall voyding such feuerous, and flatuous Spirites, as lurke within, into such a violent chill shiuering shaking Ague, as euen nowe you see the Earth haue. Which Ague, or rather euery fitte thereof, we schollers call grossely, and homely, Terroe motus , a moouing, or sturring of the Earth, you Gentlewomen, that feare, and agony of the Earth: we being onely mooued,and not terrified, you being only in a manner terrified, & scarcely mooued therewith. Nowe here, (and it please you) lyeth the poynt,and quidditie of the controuersie, whether our Motus , or your Metus , be the better, & more consonant to the Principles and Maximes of Philosophy? the one being manly, and deuoyde of dreade, the other woomannish, and most wofully quiuering, and shiuering for very feare. In sooth, I use not to dissemble with Gentlewomen: I am statly of Opinion, the Earth whereof man was immediately made, and not wooman, is in all propositions and similitudes liker vs than you, and when it fortuneth to be distempered, and disseased, either in part, or in whole, I am persuaded, and I beleeue Reason, and Philosophy will beare me out in it, it only mooueth with the very impulsiue force of the malady, and not trembleth, or quaketh for dastardly feare. Nowe, I beseeche you, what thinke ye, Gentlewomen, by this Reason: Reason; quoth Madame Incredula: By my truly, I can neither picke out Rime, nor Reason, out of any thing I haue hearde yet. And yet me thinkes all should be Gospell, that commeth from you Doctors of Cambridge. But I see well, all is not Gould, that glistereth. In d eede, quoth Mistresse Inquisitiua, heere is much adooe, I trowe, and little helpe. But it pleaseth Master. H. (to delight himselfe, and these Gentlemen) to tell vs a trim goodly Tale of Robinhood, I knowe not what. Or suer if this be Gospell, I dowte, I am not in a good bel eefe. Trust me truly, Syr your Eloquence farre passeth my Intelligence. Did I not tell you aforehand, quoth I, as muche? And yet would you needes presume of your Capacities in such profound mysteries of Philosophie, and Priuities of Nature, as these be? The very thinking whereof, (vnlesse happily it be per fidem implicitam , in beleeuing,as the learned beleeue, And saying, It is so, bycause it is so) is nighe enough, to caste you both into a fitte, or two, of a daungerous shaking feauer, vnlesse you presently seeke some remedie to preuent it. And in earnest, if ye wyll giue me leaue, vpon that small skill I haue in Extrinsecall, and Intrinsecall Physiognomie, & so foorth, I will wager all the money in my poore purse to a pottle of Hyppocrase, you shall both this night, within somwhat lesse than two howers and a halfe, after ye be layed, Dreame of terrible straunge Agues, and Agonyes as well in your owne prettie bodyes, as in the mightie great body of the Earth. You are very merily disposed, God be praysed, quoth Mistresse Inquisitiua, I am glad to see you so pleasurable. No doubt, but you are maruellous priuie to our dreames. But I pray you now in a little good earnest, doo you Schollers thinke, that it is the very reason in deede, which you spake of euen now? There be many of vs, good Mistresse, quoth I, of that opinio: wherein I am content to appeale to ye knowledge of these learned Gentlemen here. And some againe, of our finest conceited heades defend this Positio, (a very strauge Paradox in my fancie:) ye the Earth hauing taken in too much drinke, & as it were ouer lauish Cups, (as it hath sensibly done in a maner all this Winter past) now staggereth & reeleth, & tottereth, this way and that way, vp & downe, like a drunken man, or wooman (when their Alebench Rhetorick comes vpon them, & specially the moouing Patheticall figure Pottyposis ,) & therefore in this forcible sort, you lately sawe, payneth itselfe to vomit vp againe, that so disordereth, and disquieteth the whole body within. And, forsoothe, a fewe new Contradictorie fellowes make no more of it, but a certaine vehement, and passionate neesing, or sobbing, or coffing, wherewithall they say, and as they say, say with great Physicall, and Naturall Reason, The Earth in some place, or other, euer lightly after any great, and suddayne alteration of weather, or diet, is exceedingly troubled, and payned, as namely this very Time of the yeare, after the extreeme pynching colde of Winter, and agayne in Autumne, after the extreeme parching heate of Sommer. But shall I tell you, Mistresse Inquisitiua? The soundest Philosophers in deede, and very deepest Secretaries of Nature, holde, if it please you, an other Assertion, and maintayne this for truth: (which at the leastwise, of all other seemeth maruellous reasonable, and is questionlesse farthest off from Heresie:) That as the Earth, vppon it, hath many stately, and boysterous & fierce Creatures, as namely, Men and Women, and diuers Beastes, wherof some one is in maner continually at variaunce and fewde with another, euermore seeking to be reuenged vpo his enimie, which est soones breaketh forth into professed and open Hostilitie: and then consequently followe set battels, & mortall warres: wherin the one partie bendeth all the force of his Ordinance and other Martiall furniture against the other: so likewise within it too, it hath also some, as vengibly and forwardly bent, as for Example, Woormes, and Moules, and Cunnyes, and such other valiauntly highminded Creatures, ye Sonnes and daughters of Mars, & Bellona that nurrish ciuill debate, and contrarie factions amongst them selues: which are seldome, or neuer ended too, without miserable bloudshed, and deadly warre: and then go ine their Gunnes lustily off, and the one dischargeth his Peece coutagiously at the other: and there is suche a Generall dub a dubbe amongst them, and such horrible Thundering on euery syde, and suche a monstrous cruell shaking of one an others Fortes and Castels, that the whole Earth agayne, or at the least, so muche of the Earth, as is ouer, or neere them, is terribly hoysed, and --- --- No more Ands, or Ifs, for Gods sake, quoth the Madame, and this be your great Doctorly learning. Wee haue euen Enoughe alreadie for our Money: and if you shoulde goe a little farther, I feare mee, you woulde make vs nyghe as cunning as your selfe: and that woulde bee a great disgrace to the Uniuersitie. Not a whitte, gentle Madame, quoth I, there be of vs, that haue greater store in our bowgets, than we can well occupie our selues, and therefore we are glad as you see, when by the fauourable, & gratious aspect of some blessed Planet, and specially our Mercury, or your Venus, it is our good Fortune, to lighte on such good friendes, as you, and some other good Gentlewoomen be, that take pleasure, & comfort in such good things. Wherat Mistresse Inquisitiua, laughing right out, and beginning to demaunde I know not what, (me thought, shee made, as if it shoulde haue been some goodly plausible Iest, wherat shee is, and takes her selfe prettily good:) Well, well, Master H. quoth the Gentleman of the house, now you haue playde your part so cunningly with the Gentlewoomen, (as I warrant you shall be remembred of Inquisitiua, when you are gone, and may happely forget her: which I hope, Mistresse Incredula will do sometyme too, by hir leaue:) I pray you in earnest, let vs men learne some thing of you too: and especially I would gladly heare your Iudgement, and resolution, whether you counte of Earthquakes, as Naturall, or Supernaturall motions. But the shorter, all the better. To whom I made answere, in effect, as followeth: Truely Syr. vnder correction, and in my fancie: The Earthquakes themselues I would saye are Naturall in as I veryly beleeue the Internall Causes thereof, are: I meane those two Causes, which the Logicians call, the Materiall, and the Formall: Marry, the Externall Causes; which are the Efficient and Finall, I take rather of the two, to be supernaturall. I must crave a little leaue to laye open the matter. The Materiall Cause of Earthquakes, (as was superficially touched in the beginning of our speache, and is sufficiently prooved by Aristotle in ye seconde Booke of his Meteoro. ) is no doubt great aboundance of wynde, or stoare of grosse and drye vapors, and spirites, fast shut vp, & as a man would saye, emrprysoned in the Caues, and Dungeons of the Earth which winde, or vapors, seeking to be set at libertie, and to get them home to their Naturall lodgings, in a great fume, violently rush out, and as it were, breake prison, which forcible Eruption, and strong breath, causeth an Earthquake. As is excellently, and very liuely expressed of Ouid, as I remember, thus: Vis fera ventorum c aecis inclusa cauernis, Exspirare aliquio cupiens, luctataq frustra Liberiore frui coelo, c um carcere Rima Nulla foret, toto nec peruia flatibus esset, Extentam tumefecit humum, ceu spiritus eris, Tendere vesicam solet , and so foorth. The formall Cause, is nothing but the very manner of this same Motion, and shaking of the Earth without: and the violent kinde of striuing, and wrastling of the windes, and Exhalations within: which is, and must needes be done in this, or that sort, after one fashion, or other. Nowe, syr, touching the other two Causes, which I named Externall: The first immediate Efficient, out of all Question, is God himselfe, the Creatour, and Continuer, and Corrector of Nature, and therefore Supernaturall: whose onely voyce carrieth such a reuerend and terrible Maiestie with it, that the very Earth againe, and highest Mountaines quake & tremble at the sounde and noyse thereof: the text is rife in euery mans mouth: Locutus est Dominus & contremuit Terra: howbeit, it is not to be gainesayd, that is holden of all the auncient Naturall Philosophers, and Astronomers, for the principall, or rather sole Efficient, that the Influence, and heate of the Sunne, and Starres, and specially of the three superior Planets, Saturne, Iupiter, and Mars, is a secondarie Instrumentall Efficient of such motions. The finall, not onely that the wynde shoulde recouer his Naturall place, than which a naturall reasonable man goeth no farther, no not our excellentest profoundest Philosophers themselues: but sometime also, I graunt, to testifie and denounce the secrete wrathe, and indignation of God, or his sensible punishment vppon notorious malefactours, or, a threatning Caueat, and forewarning for the inhabitantes, or the like, depending vppon a supernaturall Efficient Cause, and tending to a supernaturall Morall End. Which End, (for that I knowe is the very poynt, whereon you stande) albeit it be acknowledged Supernaturall and purposed, as I sayd, of a supernaturall Cause, to whom nothing at all is impossible, and that can worke supernaturally, and myraculously without ordinarie meanes, and inferiour causes: yet neuerthelesse is, we see, commonly performed, by the qualifying, and conforming of Nature, and Naturall things, to the accomplishment of his Diuine and incomprehensible determination. For being, as the olde Philosophers call him, very Nature selfe, or as it hath pleased our later schoolemen to terme him, by way of distinction, Natura Naturans, he hath all these secondarie inferiour thinges, the foure Elementes, all sensible, and vnsensible, reasonable, and vnreasonable Creatures, the whole worlde, and what soeuer is contayned in the Compas of the worlde, being the workmanship of his owne hands, and, as they call them, Natura naturata, euer pliable and flexible Instrumentes at his Commaundement: to put in execution such Effectes, either ordinarie or extraordinarie, as shall seeme most requisite to his eternall Prouidence: and now in these latter dayes, very seldome, or in manner neuer worketh any thing so myraculously, and extraordinarily, but it may sensibly appeare, he vseth the seruice and Ministerie of his Creatures, in the atcheeuing thereof. I denie not, but Earthquakes (as well as many other fearefull Accidentes in the same Number,) are terrible signes, and, as it were certaine manacing forerunners, and forewarners of the great latter day, and therefore out of controuersie the more reuerendly to be considered vppon: and I acknowledge considering the Euentes, and sequeles, according to the collectio and discourse of mans Reason, they haue seemed to Prognosticate, and threaten to this, and that Citie, vtter ruyne and destruction: to such a Country, a generall plague and pestilence: to an other place, the death of some mightie Potentate or great Prince: to some other Realme or Kingdome, some cruell imminent warres: and sundry the like dreadfull and particular Incidentes, as is notoriously euident by many olde and newe, very famous and notable Histories to that effect. Which of all other the auncient Romaines, long before the Natiuitie of Christ, did most religiously or rather superstitiously obserue, not without a number of solemne Ceremonies, and Hollydayes for the nonce, euer after any Earthquake, making full account of some such great rufull casualtie or other, as otherwhyles fell out in very deede: and namely, as I remember, the yeare Ante bellum Sociale, which was one of the lamentablest, and myserablest warres, that Italy euer sawe: and Plinie, or I knowe not well who, hath such a saying: Roma nunquam tremuit, vt non futurus aliquis portenderetur insignis Euentus. But yet, notwithstanding, dare not I aforehand presume thus farre, or arrogate so much vnto my selfe, as to determine precisely and peremptorily of this, or euery the like singular Earthquake, to be necessarily, and vndoubtedly a supernaturall, and immediate fatall Action of God, for this, or that singular intent, when as I am sure, there may be a sufficient Naturall, eyther necessarie or contingent Cause in the very Earth it selfe: and there is no question, but the selfe same Operation in Genere, or in specie, may at one tyme, proceeding of one Cause, and referred to one End, be preternaturall, or supernaturall: at another tyme, proceeding of an other, or the same Cause, and referred to an other End, but Ordinarie, and Naturall. To make shorte, I cannot see, and would gladly learne, howe a man on Earth, should be of so great authoritie, and so familiar acquaintance with God in Heauen, (vnlesse haply for the nonce he hath lately intertained some few choice singular ones of his priuie Counsell) as to be able in such specialties, without any iustifyable certificate, or warrant) to reueale hys incomprehensible mysteries, and definitiuely to giue sentence of his Maiesties secret and inscrutable purposes. As if they had a key for all the lockes in Heauen, or as if it were as cleare and resolute a case, as the Eclipse of the Sunne, that darkened all the Earth, or at the least all the Earth in those Countries, at Christes Passion, happening altogether prodigiously and Metaphysically in Plenilunio , not according to the perpetuall course of Nature, in Nouilunio: in so much that Dionisius Areopagita, or some other graunde Philosopher, vpon the suddayne contemplation there of, is reported in a certaine Patheticall Ecstasie to haue cryed out, Aut rerum Natura patitur, aut Mundi machina destruetur: as my minde giueth me, some of the simpler, and vnskilfuller sort, will goe nye to doe vpon the present sight, and agony of this Earthquake. Marry the Errour I graunt, is the more tollerable, though perhappes it be otherwhiles, (and why not euen nowe,) a very presumptuous Errour in deede, standing only vpon these two weake and deceitfull groundes, Credulitie and Ignoraunce: if so be inwardly (not onely in Externall shewe, after an Hypocriticall, and Pharisaicall manner) it certainly doo vs good for our reformation, and amendment, and seeme to preache vnto vs, Poenitentiam agite , (as in some respect euery suche straunge and rare Accident may seeme:) how Ordinarie, and Naturall so euer the Cause shall appeare otherwise to the best learned: especially, as the Earthquake shall be knowne to endure a longer, or a shorter Tyme, or to be more or lesse generall, in more, or fewer places. Which two differences, touching the quantitie of Tyme, and Place, after I had a little more fully prosecuted, alledging certaine particuler Examples thereof, howe in some places huge Castels, in some Townes, in some great and mightie Cities, in some Shires and Seigniories, and Prouinces, in some whole Countryes, and Regions haue been perillously mooued and shaken therewith: in one place, a long time together: in an other place, not so long, or at seuerall and parted times: in another, very short, as, God be thanked here euen nowe: and finally by the way, shewing a thirde and most notable difference of all, (as well for the present or imminent terrour and daunger, as otherwise) by the sundry species , and formes which Aristotle, Plinie, and other Meteorologicians haue set downe of Exprience, as they haue heard, or read, or seen the earth to quake, to sturre, and hoyse vp Houses, Walles, Towers, Castelles, Churches, Minsters, whole Townes, whole Cities, whole Prouinces, without farther harme: to ruinate and ouerthrowe, and destroy some: to yawne and gape, and open lyke a graue, and consequently to swallow vp and deuour other: and sometime also to drinke vp whole riuers, and mightie bigge running waters withall, or to chaunge and alter their common woonted course some other way: to sinke and fall downewardes: to cast out and vomitte vp either huge vaste heapes, as it were Mountaines of Earth, or large Ilandes in the mayne Sea, neuer remembred, or seen before: or great ouerflowing waters, and fountaynes: or hotte scalding sulphurous lakes: or burning sparkles and flames of fire: to make a horrible hissing, gnashing, ratling, or some like woonderfull straunge noyse, (which all Effectes are credibly reported, and constantly auouched, of our most famous & best allowed Philosophers) a fewe such particularities, and distinctions, compendiously and familiarly coursed ouer. The good Gentleman gaue me hartily, as appeared, very great thankes, and tolde me plainly he neuer either read, or heard halfe so much of Earthquakes before: confessing withall, that he yeelded resolutely to my opinion: that an Earthquake might as well be supposed a Naturall Motion of the Earth, as a preternaturall, or supernaturall ominous worke of God: and that he thought it hard, and almost impossible, for any man, either by Philosophie, or Diuinitie, euermore to determine flatly the very certaintie either way. Which also in conclusion was the verdit, and finall resolution of the greater and sager part of the Gentlemen present: & namely of an auncient learned common Lawyer, that had been Graduate, and fellow of a Colledge in Cambridge, in Queene Maries dayes. Who tooke vpon him, to knit vp the matter, & as he said determine the controuersie, with the authoritie of all the naturall Philosophers, old or newe, Heathen or Christian, Catholique or Protestant, that euer he read, or heard tell of There Physickes quoth he, are in euery mans hands: they are olde enough to speake for them selues, and wee are young enough to turne our Bookes. They that haue Eyes and Tongues, let them see, and reade. But what say you nowe, quoth I, to the staying and quieting of the Earthe, beeing once a moouing? May it not seeme a more myraculous woorke, and greater woonderment, that it shoulde so suddainely staye againe, being mooued, than that it shoulde so suddainely mooue, beyng quiet and still? Mooue or turne, or shake me a thing in lyke order, be it neuer so small, and lesse than a pynnes Head, in comparison of the great mightie circuite of the Earth, and see if you shall not haue much more a doo to staye it presently, beeing once sturred, than to sturre it at the very first. Whereat the Gentleman smyling, and looking merrily on the Gentlewoomen, heere is a schoole poynt, quoth he, that by your leaues, I beleeue will poase the better scholler of you both. But is it not more than tyme, thynke ye, wee were at Supper? And if you be a hungered, Maister H. you shall thanke no body but your selfe, that haue holden vs so long with your profounde and clerkly discourses, whereas our manner is to suppe at the least a long howre before this tyme. Beyng set, and newe occasion of speeche ministered, our Supper put the Earthquake in manner out of our myndes, or at the leastwise, out of our Tongues: sauing that the Gentlewoomen, nowe and then pleasauntly tyhyhing betweene them selues, especially Mystresse Inquisitiua, (whose minde did still runne of the drinking, and Neesing of the Earth,) repeated here, and there, a broken peece of that, which had been already sayde before Supper. With deepe iudgement no doubt, and to maruellous great purpose, I warrant you after the manner of woomen Philosophers, and Diuines. And this summarily in Effect was our yesternyghtes graue Meteorologicall Conference, touching our Earthquake here in the Country: which being in so many neighbour Townes, and Uillages about vs, as I heare say of this morning, maketh me presuppose, the like was wyth you also at London, and elsewhere farther of. And then forsoothe, must I desire Maister Immerito, to send me with in a weeke or two, some odde fresh paulting threehalfepennie Pamphlet for newes: or some Balductum Tragicall Ballet in Ryme, and without Reason, setting out the right myserable, and most wofull estate of the wicked, and damnable worlde at these perillous dayes, after the deuisers best manner: or whatsoeuer else shall first take some of your braue London Eldertons in the Head. In earnest, I could wishe some learned, and well aduized Uniuersitie man, woulde vndertake the matter, and bestow some paynes in deede vppon so famous and materiall an argument. The generall Nature of Earthquakes by definition, and the speciall diuersitie of them by diuision, beyng perfectly knowen: (a thing soone done) and a complete Induction of many credible and autenticall, both olde and newe, diuine and prophane, Greeke, Lattine, and other Examples, (with discretion, and iudgement, compyled and compared togither) being considerately and exactly made, (a thing not so easily done) much no doubt myght be alledged too or fro, to terrifie or pacific vs, more or lesse. If it appeare by generall Experience, and the foresayde Historicall Induction of particulars, that Earthquakes, sine omni exceptione , are ominous, and significatiue Effectes, as they saye of Comets, and carrie euer some Tragicall and horrible matter with or after them: as eyther destruction of Townes and Cities, or decay of some mightie Prince, or some particular, or generall plague, warre, or the lyke, (vt supra) whatsoeuer the Materiall, or Formall cause be, Natural, or supernaturall, (howbeit for myne owne part I am resolued, as wel for the one, as for the other, that these two I speake of, both Matter and Fourme, are rather Naturall in both, than otherwise) it concerneth vs, vpon the vewe of so Effectuall and substaunciall euidence, to conceiue seriously, and reuerently of the other two Causes: the first, supreme Efficient, whose Omnipotent Maiestie hath nature self, and all naturall Creatures at commaundement: and the last finall, which we are to iudge of as aduisedly, and prouidently, as possibly we can, by the consideration, & comparison of Circumstances, the tyme when: the place where? the qualities, and dispositions of the persons, amongst whom such, and such an Ominous token is giuen. Least happily through ouer great credulitie, and rashnesse, we mistake Non Causam pro causa , and sophistically be entrapped Elencho Finiu. Truely, I suppose, he had neede be an excellent Philosopher, a reasonable good Historian, a learned Diuine, a wise discrete man, and generally, such a one as our Doctor Still,  & Doctor Byng are in Cambridge, that shoulde shew himselfe accordingly in this argument, and to the iudgement and contentation of the wisest, perfourme it exactly. My selfe remember nothing to the contrarie, either in Philosophie, or in Histories, or in Diuinitie either, why I may not safely & lawfully subscribe to the iudgement of the noble Italian Philosopher, and most famous learned Gentleman, whilest he liued, Lord of Mirandola, and Erle of Concordia, partly Philosophically, partly Theologically set downe, in the firt Chapter of his sixt Booke, against Cogging deceitfull Astrologers, and Southsayers, De rerum Pr aenotione, pro veritate Relligionis, contra Superstitiosas vanitates. In which Chapter, (if happely you haue not read it already,) you shall finde many, but specially these three notable places, most effectuall and directly pertinent to the very purpose. The first more vniuersall. Natur ae opere fieri non potest, vt Ostentis, vt Monstris magni illi, seu dextri, seu sinistri euentus portendantur, & ab aliquae pendeant proxima causa, quae & futura etiam proferat. Impostura Daemonum, vt id fiat, videri potest. Sed & plaeraq non monstrosa, non prodigiosa per sese, pro monstris tamen, & portentis, haberi possunt, & solent a quibusdam, quibus Rerum Natura non satis comperta est, causarum enim ignoratio, noua in re Admirationem parit. Propter quam, philosophari homines caepisse, in exordys primae philosophiae scribit Aristoteles. Wherein those two seuerall points, Impostura D aemonum , and Ignoratio causarum , are no doubt maruellous probable, and moste worthy bothe presentlye to bee noted nowe, and more fully to be discussed hereafter: appearing vnto me the verie right principall Causes of so manye erroneous opinions, and fantasticall superstitious dreames in this, and the like behalfe. The seconde more speciall, as it were bitting the white in deede, and cleauing the Pinne in sunder. Idem in Terr aemotibus etiam, quod in fulguribus;, fulminibusq interpretandis, obseruauit Antiquitas. Cuius Reiliber, Graeco eloquio, nuper ad manus peruenit, in Orpheum relatus Autorem: sed perabsurdum nimis, vt quod frequentissime fit, pro vario terrae anhelitu, pro ventorum viblentia, vaporumq conductione , (marke you that?) ex co rerum futurarum significationem petere, quorum nec effectus esse possunt, nec causa, pr aeter que forte mortis inferendae illis, qui fulmen exceperit, aut qui terrarum hiatu perierit. Sed nec ab eadem proxima deduci causa possunt, a qua & futurae pendeant res, vt supra deductum est. And then shortly after, the thirde, moste agreeable to the seconde, as flatlye determining on my side, and as directlye concluding the same position as may be. Nec san e Orpheus ille, si tamen Orpheus fuit, vllam affert omnino causam, cur quispiam ex terrae motibus, vrbium, hominum, regionum euenta praesagire possit. Solum vana narrat arbitrio: si terrae contigerit motus, nocti, si aestate, si hyeme, si aurora, si interdiu, quid portendatur: Quae certe, & saniore possunt arbitrio refelli, & Experientiae testimonio, vt arbitror, non secus irrideri, ac supra Tagis portenta irrisinius, Haruspicinae Autoris. A moste excellent sounde Iudgement in my conceit: and ful wel beseeming so Honorable and admirable a Witte, as out of Question, Picus Mirandula thirty yeres of age, for his singularitie in al kind of knowleege as wel diuine as prophane, was in Italy and France, as Paulus Iouius reporteth, surnamed Phoenix, as the odde, and in effecte the onely singular learned man of Europe: and to make shorte: suche a one, in moste respectes, as I woulde wishe nowe to be tempering with this newe notorious incident: staying my selfe in the meane while vpon this probable and reasonable Interim of his: and preferring it before al the friuolous coniecturall Allegations, and surmises, that oure counterfaite, and reasonlesse Orphei oppose to the contrarye. But, Iesu, what is all this to Master Immerito? Forsoothe I knowe not by what mischaunce, these miserable balde odious three halfepenny fellowes, alas, a company of silly beetleheaded Asses, came into my minde, that wil needes be sturring, and taking on in euerye suche rare and vnaccustomed euent, as if they sawe farther in a Milstone, than all the worlde besides, whereas euerie man, that hathe but halfe an eye in his head, seeth them to be more blinde, than anye Buzzarde, or Bayarde, Scribimus indocti, doctiq, Poemata passim, and surely, as the worlde goeth nowe in Englande, rather the firste, for aught I see, than the laste. O interim miseras Musas, & miserabiles: Where the faulte shoulde rest, viderint Oculi, at que capita Reip. Mihi quidem isthic, neque seritur admod um, neg metitur. Non valde mea nouos Bibliotheca libros desiderat, seipsa, id est, quos habet, veteribus contenta est. Quid plura? Tis vale, mi Immerito, atque ita tibi persuade, Aliquid esse eum, qui istorum longe est dissimilimus, quos Typographi nostri habent venales maxime. Commende mee to thine owne good selfe, and tell thy dying Pellicane, and thy Dreames from me, I wil nowe leaue dreaming any longer of them, til with these eyes I see them forth indeede: And then againe, I imagine your Magnificenza, will holde vs in suspense as long for your nine Englishe Commoedies, and your Latine Stemmata Dudleiana: whiche two shal go for my money, when all is done: especiallye if you woulde but bestow one seuennights pollishing and trimming vppon eyther. Whiche I praye thee hartily doe, for my pleasure, if not for Reconcilement of contraries, is shrunke in the wetting: I imdde purposed to haue dispatched you a Coppie thereof, long ere this: but, no remedie, hitherto it hath alwayes gone thus with me: Some newe occasion, or other, euer carrieth me from one matter to another, & will neuer suffer me to finishe eyther one or other. And truly, Experto crede , it is as true a Uerse as euer was made, since the first Uerse, that euer was made: Pluribus intentus minor est ad singula sensus: whiche my Anticosmopolita, thoughe it greeue him, can beste testifye, remayning still as we saye, in statu, quo, and neither an inche more forward, nor backewarde, than he was fully a twelue- month since in the Courte, at his laste attendaunce vpon my Lorde there. But the Birde that will not sing in Aprill nor in May, maye peraduenture sing in September: and yet me thinkes, Sat cit o, si sat bene, if I coulde steale but one poore fortnight, to peruse him ouer afreshe, and coppy him out anewe. Whiche I hope in God to compasse shortly. But I beseech you, what Newes al this while at Cambridge: That was wont to be euer one great Question. What? Det mihi Mater ipsa bonam veniam, eius vt aliqu ae mihi liceat Secreta, vni cuidam de codem gremio obsequentissimo filio, reuelare: & sic paucis habeto. Nam alias fortasse pluribus: nunc non placet, non vacat, molestum asset. Tully, and Demosthenes nothing so much studyed, as they were wonte: Liuie, and Salust possiblye rather more, than lesse: Lucian neuer so much: Aristotle muche named, but little read: Xenophon and Plato, reckned amongest Discoursers, and conceited Superficiall fellowes: much verball and sophisticall iangling: little subtile and effectuall disputing: noble and royall Eloquence, the best and persuasiblest Eloquence: no such Orators againe; as redheadded Angelles: An exceeding greate difference, betweene the countenannces, and portes of those, that are braue and gallaunt, and of those, that are basely, or meanly apparelled: betwene the learned, and vnlearned, Tully, and Tom Tooly, in effect none at all. Matchiauell a great man: Castilio of no small reputation: Petrach, happy: ouer many acquainted with Vnico Arcuno: The French and Italian when so highlye regarded of Scholiers? The Latine and Greeke, conference: many bargaines of Mounsieur: Shymeirs a noble gallant fellowe: all inquisitiue after Newes, newe Bookes, newe Fashions, newe Lawes, newe Officers, and some after newe Elementes, and some after newe Heauens, and Helles to. Turkishe affaires familiarly knowen: Castels builded in the Ayre: muche adoe, and little helpe: Iacke would faine be a Gentlemanne: in no age so little so muche made of, euery one highly in his owne fauour, thinking no mans penny, so good siluer as his own: Something made of Nothing, in spite of Nature: Numbers made of Ciphars, in spite of Arte: Geometricall Proportion seldome, or neuer vsed, Arithmeticall ouermuch abused: Oxen and Asses (notwithstandiug the absurditie it seemed to Plautus) draw both togither in one, and the same Yoke: Conclusio fer e sequitur deteriorem partem . The Gospell taughte, not learned: Charitie key colde: nothing good, but by Imputation: the Ceremoniall Lawe, in worde abrogated: the Iudiciall in effecte disanulled: the Morall indeede abandoned: the Lighte, the Lighte in euery mans Lippes, but marke me their eyes, and tell me, if they looke not liker Howlets, or Battes, than Egles: as of olde Bookes, so of auntient Uertue, Honestie, Fidelitie, Equitie, newe Abridgementes: euery day freshe span newe Opinions: Heresie in Diuinitie, in Philosophie, in Humanitie, in Manners, grounded muche vpon heresay: Doctors all, practised of none: the Diuell not so hated, as the Pope: many Inuectiues, small amendment: Skill they say controlled of Will: and Goodnesse mastered of Goods; but Agent, and Patient muche alike, neither Barrell greatly better Herring: No more adoe aboute Cappes of, conformable, with his square Cappe on his rounde heade: and Non resident fewer, either I beleeue in Acte, or I beleeue, in Purpose. A nuber of our preachers sibbe to French Souldiors, at the first, more than Men, in the end, lesse than Women. Some of our pregnantest and soonest ripe Wits, of Hermogenes mettall for al the world: Olde men and Counsailours amongst Children: Children amongst Counsailours, and olde men: Not a fewe dubble fared Iani, and chaungeable Camelions: ouer-manye Clawbackes, and Pickethanks: Reedes shaken of euerie Wind: Iackes of bothe sides: Aspen leaues: painted Sheathes, and Sepulchres: Asses in Lions skins: Dunglecockes: slipperye Eles: Dormise: I blush to thinke of some, that weene themselues as fledge as the reste, being, God wot, as kallowe as the rest: euery yonker to speake of as politique, and as great a Commonwealths man as Bishoppe Gardner, or Doctor Wutton at the least: as if euerie man nowe adayes hauing the framing of his own Horoscope, were borne in decimo coeli domicilio , and had al the Wit, Wisedome, and Worshippe in the world at commaundement. Sed heus in aurem: Meministin' quod ait Varro?

And wil you needes haue my Testimoniall of youre olde Controllers new behauior? A busy and dizy heade, a brazen forehead: a ledden braine a woodden wit: a copper face: a stony breast: a factious and eluish hearte: a founder of nouelties: a confounder of his owne, and his friends good gifts: a morning booke worm, an afternoone maltworm: a right Iuggler, as ful of his sleights, wyles, fetches, casts of Legerdemaine, toyes to mocke Apes withal, odde shiftes, and knauish practizes, as his skin can holde. He often telleth me, he looueth me as himselfe, but out lyar out, thou lyest abhominably in thy throate. Iesu, I had nigh hand forgotten one thing, that ywis somtime I think often ynough vpon: Many Pupils, Iackemates, and Hayle fellowes wel met, with their Tutors, and by your leaue, some too, because forsooth they be Gentlemen, or great heires, or a little neater and gayer than their fellowes, (shall I say it for shame? beleeue me, tis too true) their very own Tutors.

Nosti manum tanquam tuam. This Letter may only be shewed to the two odde Gentlemen you wot of. Marry I would haue those two to see it, as sone as you may conueniently. Non multis dormio: non multis scribo: non cupio placere multis: Alij alios numeros landant, pr aeferunt, venerantur: Ego fere apud nos, fere apud vos Trinitatem. Virbum sapienti sat: nosti c aetera: & tres Charites habes ad vnguem. Immerito, vvith sundry proper examples, and some Precepts of our Englishe reformed Versifying. Signor Immerito, to passe ouer youre needelesse complaint, wyth the residue of your preamble (for of ye Earthquake I presuppose you haue ere this receyued my goodly discourse) and withall to let my late Englishe Hexametres goe as lightlye as they came: I cannot choose, but thanke and honour the good Aungell, (whether it were Gabriell or some other) that put so good a motion into the heads of those two excellent Gentlemen M. Sidney, speciall and rare qualities: as to helpe forwarde our new famous enterprise for the Exchanging of Barbarous and Balductum Rymes with Artificial Uerses: the one being in manner of pure and fine Goulde, the other but counterfet, and base ylfauoured Copper. I doubt not but their liuelie example, and Practise, wil preuaile a thousand times more in short space, than the dead Aduertizement, and persuasion of M. Ascham to the same Effecte: whose Scholemaister notwithstanding I reuerence in respect of so learned a Motiue. I would gladly be acquainted with M. Drants Prosodye, and I beseeche you, commende me to good M. Sidneys iudgement, and gentle M. Immeritos Obseruations. I hope your nexte Letters, which I daily exspect, wil bring me in farther familiaritie & acquaintance with al three. Mine owne Rules and Precepts of Arte, I beleeue wil fal out not greatly repugnant, though peraduenture somewhat different: and yet am I not so resolute, but I can be content to reserue the Coppying out and publishing therof, vntil I haue a little better consulted with my pillowe, and taken some farther aduize of Madame Sperienza In the meane, take this for a general Caueat, and say I haue reuealed one great mysterie vnto you: I am of Opinion, there is no one more regular and iustifiable direction, eyther for the assured, and infallible Certaintie of our English Artificiall Prosodye particularly, or generally to bring our Language into Arte, and to frame a Grammer or Rhetorike thereof: than first of all vniuersally to agree upon one and the same Ortographie, Prosodye: whether Sir Thomas Smithes in that respect be the most perfit, as surely it must needes be very good: or else some other of profounder Learning, & longer Experience, than Sir Thomas was, shewing by necessarie demonstration, wherin he is defectiue, wil vndertake shortely to supplie his wantes, and make him more absolute. My selfe dare not hope to hoppe after him, til I see something or other, too, or fro, publickely and autentically established, as it were by a generall Counsel, or acte of Parliament: and then peraduenture, standing vppon firmer grounde, for Companie sake, I may aduenture to do as other do. Interim , credit me, I dare geue no Preceptes, nor set downe any Certaine General Arte: and yet see my boldenesse, I am not greatly squaimishe of my Particular Examples, whereas he that can but reasonably skil of the one, wil giue easily a shreude gesse at the other: considering that the one fetcheth his original and offspring from the other. In which respecte, to say troth, we Beginners haue the start, and aduauntage of our Followers, who are to frame and conforme both their Examples, and Precepts, according to that Greeke , and Ennius, or I know not who else in Latine , did preiudice, and ouerrule those, that followed them, as well for the quantities of syllables, as number of feete, and the like: their onely Examples going for current payment, and standing in steade of Lawes, and Rules with the posteritie.

Vertue sendeth a man to Renowne, Fame lendeth Aboundaunce, Fame with Aboundaunce maketh a man thrise blessed and happie. So the Rewarde of Famous Vertue makes many wealthy, And the Regard of Wealthie Vertue makes many blessed: O blessed Vertue blessed Fame blessed Aboundaunce. O that I had you three, with the losse of thirtie Comencementes. Nowe farewell Mistresse , whom lately I loued aboue all, These be my three bonny lasses, these be my three bonny Ladyes, Not the like Trinitie againe, saue onely the Trinitie aboue all: Worship and Honour, first to the one, and then to the other. A thousaud good leaues be for euer graunted Agrippa. For squibbing and declayming against many fruitlesse Artes , and Craftes, deuisde by the Diuls and Sprites , for a torment, And for a plague to the world: as both Pandora, Prometheus, And that cursed good bad Tree , can testifie at all times. Meere Gewegawes and Bables, in comparison of these. Toyes to mock Apes, and Woodcockes, in comparison of these. Iugling castes, and knicknackes, in comparison of these. Yet behinde there is one thing, worth a prayer at all tymes, A good Tongue , in a mans Head, A good Tongue in a woomans. And what so precious matter, and foode for a good Tongue, As blessed Vertue, blessed Fame, blessed Aboundaunce. Maruell not, what I meane to send these Verses at Euensong: On Neweyeeres Euen, and Oldyeeres End, as a Memento: Trust me, I know not a ritcher Iewell, newish or oldish, Than blessed Vertue, blessed Fame, blessed Abundaunce, O blessed Vertue, blessed Fame, blessed Aboundaunce, O that you had these three, with the losse of Fortie Valetes, He that wisheth, you may liue to see a hundreth Good Newe yeares, euery one happier, and merrier, than other. gladly learne, why, The , in the first , Ye in the first, and thirde, He , and My , in the last, being shorte , Me , alone should be made longer in the very same) Imagin me to come into a goodly Kentishe Garden of your old Lords, or some other Noble man, and spying a florishing Bay Tree there, to demaunde ex tempore , as followeth: Thinke vppon Petrarches Arbor vittoriosa, tiromfale, Onor d' Imperadori, e dt Poete: and perhappes it will aduaunce the wynges of your Imagination a degree higher: at the least if any thing can be added reported to haue all the Intelligences at commaundement, and an other time, Christened her, Segnior Pegaso. Waat might I call this Tree? A Laurell ? O bonny Laurell: Needes to thy bowes will I bow this knee, and vayle my bonetto: Who, but thou, the renowne of Prince, and Princely Poeta: Th'one for Crowne, for Garland th'other thanketh Apollo. Thrice happy Daphne : that turned was to the Bay Tree, Whom such seruauntes serue, as challenge seruice of all men. Who chiefe Lorde, and King of Kings, but th' Emperour only? And Poet of right stampe, ouerawith th' Emperour himselfe. Who, but knowes Aretyne , was he not halfe Prince to the Princes. And many a one there liues, as nobly minded at all poyntes. Now Farewell Bay Tree , very Queene, and Goddesse of all trees, Ritchest perle to the Crowne, and fayrest Floure to the Garland. Faine wod I craue, might I so presume, some farther aquaintaunce, O that I might? but I may not: woe to my destinie therefore. Trust me, not one more loyall seruaunt longes to thy Personage, But what sayes Daphne? Non omni dormio , worse lucke: Yet Farewell, Farewell, the Reward of those, that I honour: Glory to Garden : Glory to Muses : Glory to Vertue. Partim Ioui, & Palladi, Partim Apollini & Musis. But seeing I must needes bewray my store, and set open my shoppe wyndowes, nowe I pray thee, and coniure thee by all thy amorous Regardes, and Exorcismes of Loue, call a Parliament of thy Sensible, & Intelligible powers together, & tell me, in Tom Trothes earnest, what Il fecondo, & famoso Poeta , Mester Immerito, sayth to this bolde Satyrtall Libell lately deuised at the instaunce of a certayne worshipfull Hartefordshyre Gentleman, of myne olde acquayntaunce: in Gratiam quorundam Illustrium Anglofrancitalorum, hic & vbique apud nos volitantium. Agedum vero, nosti homines, tanquam tuam ipsius cutem. Since Galateo came in, and Tuscanisme gan vsurpe, Vanitie aboue all. Villanie next her, Statelynes Empresse. No man, but Minion, Stowte, Lowte, Plaine, swayne, quoth a Lording: No wordes but valorous, no workes but woomanish onely. For life Magnificoes, not a beck but glorious in shew, In deede most friuolous, not a looke but Tuscanish alwayes. His cringing side necke, Eyes glauncing, Pisnamie smirking, With forefinger kisse and braue embrace to the footewarde. Largebelled Kodpeasd Dublet, vnkodpeased halfe hose, Straite to the dock, like a shirte and close to the britch, like a diueling. A little Apish Hatte, cowched fast to the pate, like an Oyster, French Camarick Ruffes, deepe with a witnesse, starched to the purpose. Euery one A per se A, his termes, and braueries in Print, Delicate in speach, queynte in araye: conceited in all poyntes: In Courtly guyles, a passing singular odde man, For Gallantes a braue Myrrour, a Primerose of Honour, A Diamond for nonce a fellowe perelesse in England. Not the like Discourser for Tongue, and head to be found out: Not the like resolute Man , for great and serious affayres, Not the like Lynx , to spie out secretes, and priuities of States. Eyed , like to Argus, Earde , like to Midas, Nosd , hke to Naso, Wingd , like to Mercury , fittst of a Thousand for to be employde, This, nay more than this doth practise of Italy in one yeare. None doe I name, but some doe I know, that a peece of a tweluemonths Hath so perfited outly, and inly, both body, both soule, That none for sense, and senses, halfe matchable with them. A Vulturs smelling, Apes tasting, sight of an Eagle, A Spiders touching, Hartes hearing, might of a Lyon. Compoundes of wisedome, witte, prowes, bountie, behauiour, All gallant Vertues, all qualities of body and soule: O thrice tenne hundreth thousand times blessed and happy, Blessed and happy Trauaile, Trauailer most blessed and happy. Penatibus Herruscis iaribusque nostris Inquilinis: Tell me in good sooth, doth it not too euidently appeare, that this English Poet wanted but a good patterne before his eyes, as it might be some delicate, and choyce elegant Poesie of good M. Sidneys, or M. Dyers, ( this trimme geere was in hatching: Much like some Gentlewoomen, I coulde name in England, Who by all Physick and Physiognomie too, might as well haue brought forth all goodly faire children, as they haue now some ylfauored and deformed, had they at the tyme of their Conception, had in sight, the amiable and gallant beautifull Pictures of Adonis, Cupido, Ganymedes, or the like, which no doubt would haue wrought such deepe unpression in their fantasies, and imaginations, as their children, and perhappes their Childrens children too, myght haue thanked them for, as long as they shall haue Tongues in their heades. But myne owne leysure fayleth me: and to say troth, I am lately become a maruellous great straunger at myne olde Mistresse Poetries, being newly entertayned, and dayly employed in our Emperour Iustinians seruice ( sauing that I haue alreadie addressed a certaine pleasurable, and Morall Politique Naturall mixte deuise, to his most Honourable Lordshippe, in the same kynde, where vnto my next Letter, if you please mee well, may perchaunce make you priuie:) marrie nowe, if it lyke you in the meane while, for varietie sake, to see howe I take a young Brother of myne, (whom of playne Iohn, Lo here (and God will) a peece of hollydayes exercise. In the morning I gaue him this Theame out of Ouid, to translate, and varie after his best fashion. Dum fueris f aelix multos numerabis Amicos, Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris. Aspicis, vt veniant ad candida tecta columb ae? Accipiat nullas sordida Turris Aues ? His translation, or rather Paraphrase before dinner, was first this: Whilst your Bearnes are fatte, whilst Cofers stuffd with aboundaunce, Freendes will abound: If bearne waxe bare, then adieu sir a Goddes name. See ye the Dooues? they breede, and feede in gorgeous Houses: Scarce one Dooue doth loue to remaine in ruinous Houses, And then forsooth this is to make proofe of his facultie in Pentameters too, affecting a certaine Rithmus withall. Whilst your Ritches abound, your friends will play the Placeboes, If your wealth doe decay, friend, like a feend, will away, Dooues light, and delight in goodly fairetyled houses: If your House be but olde Dooue to remoue be ye bolde. If so be goods encrease, then dayly encreaseth a goods friend. If so be goods decrease, then straite decreaseth a goods friend. Then God night goods friend, who seldome prooueth a good friend, Giue me the goods, and giue me the good friend, take ye the goods friend. Douehouse, and Louehouse, in writing differ a letter: In deede scarcely so much, so resembleth an other an other. Tyle me the Doouehouse trimly, and gallant, where the like storehouse? Fyle me the Doouehouse: leaue it vnhansome, where the like poorehouse? Looke to the Louehouse: where the resort is, there is a gaye showe: Gynne port, and mony fayle: straight sports and Companie faileth. Beleeue me, I am not to be charged with aboue one, or two of the Uerses: and a foure or fiue wordes in the rest. His afternoones Theame was borrowed out of him, who one in your Coate, they say, is as much beholding vnto, as any Planet, or Starre in Heauen is vnto the Sunne: and is quoted as your self best remember, in the Close of your October. Giunto Alessandro ala famosa tomba Del fero Achille, sospirando disse, O fortunato, che sichiara tromba Trouasti. Within an houre, or there aboutes, he brought me these foure lustie Hexameters, altered since not past in a worde, or two. Noble Alexander, when he came to the tombe of Achilles, Sighing spake with a bigge voyce: O thrice blessed Achilles. That such a Trump, so great, so loude, so glorious hast found, As the renowned, and surprizing Archpoet Homer. Uppon the viewe whereof, Ah my Syrrha, quoth I here is a gallant exercise for you in deede: we haue had a little prettie triall of you Latin, owne Tongue: And with that, reaching a certaine famous Booke, called the Emblemes, in Marche: and bad him make them eyther better, or worse in English verse. I gaue him an other howres respite: but before I looked for him, he suddainely rushed vpon me, and gaue me his deuise, thus formally set downe in a faire peece of Paper. Of Honny, and of Gaule in Loue there is store, The Honny is much, but the Gaule is more. To be wize, and eke to Loue. Is graunted scarce to God aboue. Loue is a thing more fell, than full of Gaule, than of Honny, And to be wize, and Loue, is a worke for a God, or a Goddes peere. With a small voluntarie Supplement of his owne, on the other side, in commendation of hir most gratious, and thrice excellent Maiestie: Not the like Virgin againe, in Asia, or Afric, or Europe, For Royall Vertues, for Maiestie, Bountie, Behauiour. In both not passing a worde, or two, corrected by mee. Something more I haue of his, partly that very day begun, and partly continued since: but yet not so perfitly finished, that I dare committe the viewe, and examination thereof, to Messer Immeritoes Censure, whom after those same two incomparable and myraculous Gemini, Omni exceptione maiores , I recount, and chaulk vppe in the Catalogue of our very principall Englishe Aristarchi. Howbeit, I am nigh halfe perswaded, that in tyme ( siquidem vltima primis respondeant ) for length, bredth, and depth, it will not come far behinde your Epithalamion Thamesis : the rather, hauing so fayre a president, and patterne before his Eyes, as I warrant him, and he presumeth to haue of that: both Master Collinshead, and M. Hollishead too, being togither therein. our little Catoes, Res age qu ae prosunt , make suche a buzzing & ringing in my head, that I haue little ioy to animate, & encourage either you, or him to goe forward, vnlesse ye might make account of some certaine ordinarie wages, at at the leastwise haue your meate, and drinke for your dayes workes. As for my selfe, howsoeuer I haue toyed, and trifled heretofore, I am nowe taught, and I trust I shall shortly learne, (no remedie, I must of meere necessitie giue you ouer in the playne fielde) to employ my trauayle, and tyme wholly, or chiefely on those studies and practizes, that carrie as they saye, meate in their mouth, hauing euermore their eye vppon the Title De pane lucrando , and their hand vpon their halfpenny. For, I pray now, what saith M. Cuddie, alias you know who, in the tenth Æ glogue of the foresaid famous new Calender? Piers, I haue piped erst so long with payne, That all myne Oten reedes been rent, and wore, And my poore Muse hath spent hir spared store, Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne. Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore, And ligge so layde, when winter doth her strayne. The Dapper Ditties, that I woont devize, To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry, Delighten much: what I the bett for thy? They han the pleasure, I-a selender prize. I beate the bushe, the birdes to them doe flye, What good thereof to Cuddy can arise?. Companions , Master Cuddy, & Master Hobbinoll be as little beholding to their Mistresse Poetrie, as euer you wist: yet he peraduenture, by the meanes of hir speciall fauour, and some personall priuiledge, may happely liue by dying Pellicanes, and purchase great landes, and Lordshippes, affourde him . Extra iocum , I like your Dreames passingly well: and the rather, bicause they sauour of that singular extraordinarie veine and inuention, whiche I euer fancied moste, and in a manner admired onelye in Lucian, Petrarche, Aretine, Pasquill, and all the most delicate, and fine conceited Grecians & Italians: (for the Romanes to speake of, are but verye Ciphars in this kinde:) whose chiefest endeuour, and drifte was, to haue nothing vulgare, but in some respecte or other, and especially in liuely Hyperbolicall Amplifications, rare, queint, and odde in euery pointe, and as a man woulde saye, a degree or two at the leaste, aboue the reache, and compasse of a common Schollers capacitie. In whiche respecte notwithstanding, as well for the singularitie of the manner, as the Diuinitie of the matter, I hearde once a Diuine, preferre Saint Iohns Reuelation before al the veriest M aetaphysicall Visions, & iollyest conceited Dreames or Extasies, that euer were deuised by one or other, howe admirable, or superexcellet soeuer they seemed otherwise to the worlde. And truely I am so confirmed in this opinion, that when I bethinke me of the verie notablest, and moste wonderful Propheticall or Poeticall Uision, that euer I read, or hearde, me seemeth the proportion is so vnequall, that there hardly appeareth anye semblaunce of Comparison: no more in a manner (specially for Poets) than doth betweene the incomprehensible Wisedome of God, and the sensible Wit of Man. But what needeth this digression betweene you and me? I dare saye you wyll holde your selfe reasonably wel satisfied, if youre Dreames be but as well esteemed of in Englande, as Petrarches Visions be in Italy: whiche I assure you, is the very worst I wish you. But, see, how I haue the Arte Memoratiue at commaundement. In good faith I had once againe nigh forgotten your Faerie Queene: howbeit by good chaunce, I haue nowe sent hir home at the laste, neither in better nor worse case, than I founde hir. And must you of necessitie haue my Iudgement of hir in deede? To be plaine, imitation of Herodotus, you giue the names of the Nine Muses, ( and in one mans fansie not vnworthily) come not neerer Ariostoes Comoedies, eyther for the finenesse of plausible Elocution, or the rarenesse of Poetical Inuention, than that Eluish Queene doth to his Orlando Furioso, which notwithstanding, you wil needes seeme to emulate, and hope to ouergo, as you flatly professed you self in one of your last Letters, Besides that you know, it hath bene the vsual practise of the most exquisite and odde wittes in all nations, and specially in Italie , rather to shewe, and aduaunce themselues that way, than any other: as namely, those three notorious dyscoursing heads , Bibiena, Machiauel, and Aretine did, (to let Bembo whole countrey: being in deede reputed matchable in all points, both for conceyt of Witte, and eloquent decyphering of matters, either with Aristophanes and Menander in Greek, or with Plautus and Terence in Latin, or with any other, in any other tong. But I wil not stand greatly with you in your owne matters. If so be the Faerye Queene be fairer in your eie tha the Nine Muses, and Hobgoblin runne away with the Garland from Apollo: Marke what I saye, and yet I will not say that I thought, but there an End for this once, and fare you will, till God or some good Aungell putte you in a better minde. And yet, bicause you charge me somewhat suspitiouslye with an olde promise, to deliuer you of that iealousie, I am so farre from hyding mine owne matters from you, that loe, I muste needes be reuealing my friendes secreates, now an honest Countrey Gentleman, sometimes a Scholler: At whose request, I bestowed this pawlting vmigrely Rime vpon him, to present his Maistresse withall. The parties shall bee namelesse: sauing, that the Gentlewomans true, or counterfaite Christen name, must necessarily be bewrayed. To of one, but woulde as well in Writing, as in Speaking, haue them vsed, as Monosyllaba , thus : heavn, seavn, a leavn , as Maister Ascham in his Toxophilus doth Yrne, commonly written Yron: Vp to the pap his string did he pull, his shafte to the harde yrne. Especially the difference so manifestly appearing by the Pronunciation, betweene these twoo , a leavn a clocke and a leaven of Dowe , what absurdities thys yl fauoured Orthographye, or rather Pseudography, hathe ingendred: and howe one errour still breedeth and begetteth an other. Haue wee not , Mooneth , for Moonthe: sithence , for since: whilest , for whilste: phantasie , for phansie: euen for evn: Diuel , for Divl: God hys wrath , for Goddes wrath : and a thousande of the same stampe: wherein the corrupte Orthography in the moste, hathe beene the sole, or principall cause of corrupte Prosodye in ouer many? commonly, and maye indifferently be vsed eyther wayes. For you shal as well, and as ordinarily heare fayer , as faire , and Aier , as Aire , and bothe alike: not onely of diuers and sundrye persons, but often of the very same: otherwhiles vsing the one, otherwhiles the other: and so died , or dyde: spied , or spide: tryed , or tride: fyer , sorte: sometime Monosyallaba. sometime Polysyllaba. To conclude both pointes in one, I dare sweare priuately to your selfe, and will defende publiquely againste any, it is neither Heresie, nor Parador, to sette downe, and stande vppon this assertion, (notwithstanding all the Preiudices and Presumptions to the contrarie, if they were tenne times as manye more) that it is not, either Position, or Dipthong, or Diastole, or anye like Grammer Schoole Deuice, that doeth, or can indeede, either make long or short, or encrease, or diminish the number of Sillables, but onely the common allowed, and receiued Prosodye: taken vp by an vniuersall consent of all, and continued by a generall vse, and Custome of all. Wherein neuerthelesse I grant, after long aduise, & diligent obseruation of particulars, a certain Uniform Analogie, and Concordance, being in processe of time espyed out. Sometime this, sometime that, hath been noted by good wits in their Analyses, to fall out generally alyke? and as a man woulde saye, regularly in all, or moste wordes: as Position, Dipthong, and the like: not as firste, and essentiall causes of this, or that effecte, (here lyeth the point) but as Secundarie and Accidentall Signes, of this, or that Qualitie. feate, as the onely supreame Foundresse, and Reformer of Position, Dipthong, Orthographie, or whatsoeuer else: whose Affirmatiues are nothing worth, if she once conclude the Negatiue: and whose secund ae intentiones muste haue their whole allowance and warrante from hir prim ae . And therefore in shorte, this is the verie shorte, and the long: Position neither maketh shorte, nor long in oure Tongue, but so farre as we can get hir good leaue. Peraduenture, vppon the diligent suruewe, and examination of Particulars, some the like Analogie and Uniformity, might be founde oute in some other respecte, that shoulde as vniuersally and Canonically holde amongst vs, as Position doeth with the Latines and Greekes. I saye, (peraduenture) bycause hauing not yet made anye speciall Obseruation, I dare not precisely affirme any generall certaintie: albeit I presume, so good and sensible a Tongue, as ours is, beeyng wythall so like itselfe, as it is, cannot but haue something equipollent, and counteruaileable to the beste Tongues, in some one such kinde of conformitie, or other. And this forsooth is all the Artificial Rules and Precepts, you are like to borrowe of one man at this time.
